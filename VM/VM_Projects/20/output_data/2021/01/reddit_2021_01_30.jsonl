This is especially important when volatility enters the market. As soon as volatility decreases even a little bit, your way out of the money weekly options will start to rapidly devalue.\n\nSo I looked at the chart and AAPL is most definitely due for a short term bounce. There\u2019s a few ways to play this, but I\u2019m not sure your goal. Are you looking for a quick 30-50% profit and then sell and move on?

I\u2019ve been there...\n\nFor the top contracts, I really hope you didn\u2019t buy these before earnings and roll them through to Friday. I personally never roll shorter-term options though holdings. I\u2019ve been burned by IV crush too many times. \n\nOptimism would tell me that since Apple held strong at the $130.50 support during Friday\u2019s big sell-off, a bounce back to $133, $135, then $137 is doable. But being a long-time AAPL holder, this stock moves slower than my kids when I tell them to take out the trash. Moves in this direction may help you recoup some of those losses, but with those shorter calls you\u2019re now working against theta decay. If AAPL is flat, then it\u2019ll only get worse. \n\nPessimism tells me that the market will have another rough week. With its size, AAPL rarely moves to the upside when the market is bearish. I would personally watch the market closely on Monday and look for a spot to bail out. I\u2019d then roll that money to a March ITM call. Don\u2019t look back. Take the L and learn from it.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I've been there. It sucks man. I'd like to say that I'm past the hurdles, but it's all about continuous growth. \n\nFirst, like I said before, never hold full through earnings. Learn about Implied Volatility and how it impacts price. Build up to earnings ramps up IV, and post-earnings trading will crush it. Sure, you'll see a Netflix or CRM go crazy after earnings, but that's not the norm, and betting on those types of moves is just that, betting. But anyways, learn about a stock's historical IV and where IV currently stands. I personally use the Think or Swim app and check the IV percentile, which will tell me where the stock's IV stands when compared to previous IV trends. There may be other resources, but I use that before buying long. That's not to say I don't sometimes trade high IV stocks, but I sure as hell monitor VERY closely and manage my risk. \n\nSecond, know a stock before you trade it. AAPL is a HUGE stock, and most of the time it's a slow mover. When it makes larger moves, it tends to settles down and then trades sideways for awhile. AAPL is an awesome pre-earnings play, but not so much post-earnings. The options you purchased are better used for a stock that you were expecting to make large moves. That's just not consistently what AAPL does post-earnings. \n\n**As for your top contracts:** \n\n\\-Your 2/5's are toast. Theta is going to eat at those. At open on Monday those will be trading at almost 50% of current value. If AAPL breaks support and moves to $128, they'll likely drop below $.10. Depending on how you feel about losing $100 (because that's what all those combined will be worth) I would hold for a miracle AAPL recovery. But that's just me. I personally wouldn't add to these positions. Another option, if AAPL is trading higher pre-market, I'd sell at open. It might be the highest sell point all week. Sure AAPL could run, but that's a risk you'll have to decide on. \n\n\\-Your 2/19 $150c gives you a little bit more time. I personally would've averaged this one down on Friday. You can still average down Monday, and play for a $1.50 exit to recover some of the loses. But watch very closely. If AAPL moves towards support average down, however, if support breaks bail. \n\n\\-Your 3/19 also has some time.  I would let this one run this coming week, but would trim 2 out of 4 positions given the opportunity. Again, watch for support breaks.\n\n**Your bottom contracts:**\n\n\\-Look at these contracts as a fresh start. DO NOT play these as a way to earn back everything you lost. Set risk limits! \n\n\\-Your 2/12's are going to open to theta decay and may be down (depends on pre-market trading). Remember, AAPL held support Friday, so monitor that closely with how the market is trending. See how it moves around that support level, and consider an exit if: 1) your losses fall below your risk. I set mine at -20% or the next support level if under 25%. That's kind of high for some people, but I have enough conviction in a bullish move I'll let it break a couple support levels. 2) AAPL trades flat Mon & Tue and theta eats at your premium. 3) you hit your uptrend exit goal. \n\n\\-For your 2/19 I'd do the same as above, but would give it more time to run always mindful of support and risk. \n\nPlease take all this as just me sharing what my strategy would be and not advice. I've learned some of these things the hard way. I'm very cautious of far OTM calls, especially those with short DTEs, after getting burned over and over. If I play OTM calls now I buy 2 month out expirations and set my profit taking lower. I also set my risk level lower at 10-15%, depending on supports. OTM's will work if played right, but again manage risk!\n\nI would recommend learning about the benefits and strategy of an option's intrinsic value, and how theta plays a role.  It was a game changer for me.  I like to buy slightly ITM with a 2-3 month DTE. This Friday I purchased one 4/19 $130c when AAPL was at $131.50. I watched the market, and when it dipped into the $130's I grabbed another. Sure they are spendy, but so were those far OTM calls that you lost on. I feel comfortable letting these run back to $140, and letting them dip to the $127 support. \n\nIf you haven't already, strategize using the Options calculator: [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html)", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recovery", "aapl", "nflx", "crm"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.013577928766608238}], "tickers": ["aapl", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "This is not as sophisticated as the other useful suggestions but I use options profit calculator to strategize and anticipate my exit.

Please use these new flairs when posting if you can! Eventually we might make it a requirement for posting, but for now let's just try to do it as a group and see if we can make things a little more organized. **One of the benefits of everyone flairing stuff is that everyone can then easily filter different types of posts** (e.g. TA, FA, general discussions, help needed, educational content, news, watchlists, etc) right in the sidebar and on mobile too. The more posts that are flaired the better things will be organized and the more easily browsable the sub will be so help us out by flairing as accurately as you can!  Here's a list of all the flair I've created which you can add yourself when posting or use to filter by clicking the links in the sidebar:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* [**Discussion**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/?f=flair_name%3A%22Discussion%22) **-** General discussion and questions\n* [**News**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/?f=flair_name%3A%22News%22) **-** News stuff - let's try to keep this one focused on posts that actually have a link to a news article in them\n* [**Technical Analysis**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/?f=flair_name%3A%22Technical%20Analysis%22) **-** Anything to do with TA, that means marked up charts, trading ideas, etc\n* [**Fundamentals/DD**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/?f=flair_name%3A%22Fundamentals%2FDD%22) **-** In depth fundamental analysis/DD. Please use this one only if you're submitting significant DD, so that when people filter for it they will only get elaborate and in-depth writeups on companies\n* [**Valuation**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/?f=flair_name%3A%22Valuation%22) **-** For posts specifically aimed at valuing a company using a valuation model e.g. DCF, dividend discount model, etc. If you're valuing as part of a fundamental analysis, use the one above\n* [**Recap/Watchlist**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/?f=flair_name%3A%22Recap%2FWatchlist%22) **-** For daily market recaps and watchlists. Don't use this for an individual trading idea. Ideally watchlists would contain a list of tickers, entry/exit prices, possible stop losses, marked up charts and the reason you're watching each stock.\n* [**Resources**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/?f=flair_name%3A%22Resources%22) \\- Posts containing useful resources for traders. Standard self promotion rules still apply, so self promoting as \"resources\" doesn't get a pass, but if you have something you think could add value to our community and you made it yourself, hit us up in modmail and ask about it first\n* [**Help Needed**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/?f=flair_name%3A%22Help%20Needed%22) \\- For questions/things you actually need help with (e.g. how does X work, what does Y mean). Try to run a quick search first but if you can't find an answer, use this flair and someone will help you!\n* [**Newbie**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/?f=flair_name%3A%22Newbie%22) \\- Are you a complete newbie? Put this on your post so other newbies can find all the commonly asked questions\n* [**Education/Lessons Learned**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/?f=flair_name%3A%22Education%2FLessons%20Learned%22) **-** If the market humbled you, let us know! This one is also good for any kind of educational writeups/tutorials you'd like to post\n* [**Crypto**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/?f=flair_name%3A%22Crypto%22) **-** All crypto discussions. We don't really promote too much crypto stuff here, since there's /r/cryptocurrency, but if you want to talk about one of the major cryptos like BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, etc then use this one\n* [**Opinion**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/?f=flair_name%3A%22Opinion%22) \\- Got an opinion on something? Use this to help us separate fact from opinion\n* [**Meta**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/?f=flair_name%3A%22Meta%22) \\- All posts related to the sub itself\n\nAlright that's it for now...Let me know if you can think of any other flairs that might be useful around here or if you have any thoughts.

{"title": "To people new to trading/investing: it's okay to not go into GME/AMC/BB/NOK/etc.", "selftext": "I've been seeing a lot of people completely new to trading and investing, people who aren't even sure what a share means, people who want to invest/trade and have no idea where to start and they want to get in on the hyped up shorted stocks.\n\nThis is a reminder that it's okay to not throw your money into those stocks. In fact, if you are new to the market, I'd highly suggest not putting your money into those stocks at all until you understand 1) the reasoning why the rest of us are getting in on these stocks (ie. short squeeze, market manipulation, etc.) and 2) why **you personally** want to get in on these stocks. It might look cool right now, what with GME skyrocketing to the moon within the span of a week, but you do not want to be on the other side when it comes back down. However you think GME and the other stocks will turn out, it is still a high risk play. Do not let greed factor into your decision making\u2014 greed (by Wall Street) after all is why so many of us have ended up rallying behind GME in the first place.\n\nIf you're new to trading/investing, there are plenty of resources to understanding how it all works. Do some research on whether you're interested in trading yourself through a brokerage or if you'd rather get a robo-investor that will handle investing and risk managing for you. Or try both! That's what I did when I started out. If you decide to trade for yourself through a brokerage, look into understanding how to minimize your risk through investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, etc. and in different sectors.\n\nGood picks to start investing in would be an index ETF (which tracks a certain benchmark index) or sector ETF (which invests in a bunch of stocks of a given sector or industry). ETFs are lower risk than stocks (and so that also means lower returns). I would look into large-cap companies\u2014 their stocks are down despite the excellent earnings reports some of those companies had this week (Apple, for example), which might be due to people diverting funds for plays in GME/etc. \n\nTL;DR If you're new to trading and investing, don't get ensnared in the GME/AMC/BB/NOK hype. Make informed decisions and do what's best for **you**.\n\nThat said, I have stakes in GME, AMC, and NOK, and I am holding next week.

I firmly believe it is or i wouldn't be here acting like a retard over it. Rarely do you see a good stock with good volume like this getting soooo much negative posts and articles. There are scared and they know this one may burn them. The short interest has increased a ton in recent weeks. They keep piling on like they did in GME.\n\nWestwater Resources (NASDAQ: WWR) Is Looking Very Attractive Right Now.21% that I know of is sold short! There's 19M outstanding and 16M in the float. The shorts are scared as they have been increasing their positions a ton in the last few weeks and they have been posting negative (hit) comments and articles everywhere. It's a clear sign that diamond hands can squeeze these geniuses.\n\nHere\u2019s why\u2026\n\nWestwater may be the first major producer of battery grade graphite in the USA. The USA recently declared graphite a supply critical mineral. What the order means is the President requires certain government agencies to provide guidance in determining which projects are eligible for government support, which can include loans or grants. The agencies are also directed to use available authorities to accelerate the issuance of permits in connection with the expansion the supply chain for specified minerals.\n\nIn 2020, China will account for roughly 70% of all graphite produced, while the US only accounts for 1%. The United States Government is mandating this to change.\n\nCurrent price $6.60/share\n\nIn Monday\u2019s session, WWR shares opened at $5.90 per share after gapping from Friday\u2019s close of $5.75, closing the day at $6.60 (+14.78%) per share. Trading volume was strong at 12M shares.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the graphite picture:\n\nThe market for graphite is growing. Every battery for an electric vehicle, cell phone, tablet, laptop, solar panel, and a plethora of other devices needs graphite. Every pencil and many lubricants use graphite. A diverse number of analysts place the growth of graphite consumption at 6-20% annualized growth rate.\n\nThe USA needs a source of domestic graphite, produced in large quantities and produced in an environmentally safe manner. Right now, America imports 100% of the graphite it consumes. The USA is literally at the mercy of its offshore trading partners for supply. China is the largest supplier, currently producing 70% of the world\u2019s graphite. The graphite mined in China uses hydrofluoric in the refining process, creating a dangerous environmental cost. Westwater has filed a patent for their claim on an environmentally safe proprietary process.\n\nThe US President has issued an Executive order stating that America\u2019s reliance on foreign sources for the minerals used in batteries a national security threat and advises government agencies to offer miners credit, other financial help, and ease in permitting to develop a domestic supply of graphite and other minerals used in batteries.\n\nNow let\u2019s look at Westwater Resources:\n\nWestwater owns the most advanced graphite mine in the USA, located in Coosa County Alabama on 42,000 acres and called the Coosa Graphite Project. A Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) technical report for the Coosa Graphite Project was completed by AGP Mining Consultants Inc. in November 2015 and included an Indicated Resource of 78,488,000 tons, grading 2.39% graphitic carbon (Cg) at a 1% cutoff grade, for a total of 1,876,000 tons contained/in-situ graphite\u2014the largest graphite Indicated Resource in the United States; and Inferred Resources of 79,443,000 tons, grading at 2.56% Cg at a 1% cutoff grade, for a total of 2,034,000 tons contained/in-situ graphite.\n\nCurrently, Chinese graphite sells for $500 to $1600 per ton depending on the flake size with the larger flake size going for a premium.\n\nWWR has developed a method of processing graphite into its usable form that does not use hydrofluoric acid and has the potential to eliminate 300,000 tons of carbon emissions annually. The process is proprietary and is patent pending. The company is currently building a processing plant and in conjunction with three other facilities is processing 30 metric tons of graphite utilizing their new technology. This is happening right now!\n\nThe US government is involved in the development of a domestic graphite industry and WWR seems to have all the needed requirements to do just that in an environmentally responsible manner.\n\nThe US government carries stores of gold and oil to protect our national security. Could minerals for energy storage devices be coming into that equation?\n\nWWR looks like it could be a ground floor opportunity, right now while the share price is low (54% off its October high). Keep in mind, the public float is only 15.78 million shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice im an autist", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5145986080169678}, {"body": "I\u2019ve been playing around with stocks since 2018 and only lost money until this past July when I stopped playing with penny stocks and bought six shares of Tesla at $1,120 each.

After doing some research over the weekend about short squeezes and reading everything I could about the GME short squeeze thesis I concluded that it's neither hype nor sketch... This really could be the biggest investment opportunity of the century (not financial advice, etc etc). I bought some GME shares Monday morning and have been following it very closely (too closely, probably), reading everything I can about it. I'm definitely not an expert but wanted to share my perspective since it's a fascinating story and the media has been spinning it every which direction. I guess that shouldn't be surprising since Wall St owns the media, but I digress...\n\nI've been running on about 4 hours of sleep per night all week, staying up until pre-market and waking up before the market opens, so forgive the scatterbrained nature of this post. It has truly been a thrilling and exhausting ride, and it's not over yet...\n\n## First, a quick overview of what's happening and how we got here.\n\nThere is currently a \"short squeeze\" occurring on GameStop's stock. Short squeezes have happened a few times in the past but nothing quite like what we're seeing here.\n\nIn order to understand a short squeeze you first have to understand the basics of shorting stocks. If you know all this you can skim the next handful of paragraphs. Shorting a stock is when you ask a broker to loan you a share of stock, which you agree to return to the broker in the future. Unlike with options contracts (another story for another day), there's no time limit on how long you can maintain such a \"short position\". When the broker loans you the stock, you have to pay them interest every day until you return the stock to them. When you open the short position, the broker actually sells the shares on the open market and you sign a contract to \"return\" it to them later (with interest -- that will be extremely important later). So you make money if you can return the stock back to the broker at a cheaper price than when it was initially borrowed (minus the interest you pay the broker for keeping the stock borrowed for however long you held it). You can actually hold your short position as long as you want. There's no deadline to return the shares, but you accrue daily interest on your loan.\n\nExample: you want to short Acme, Inc (ACME) because you believe their stock is overvalued. You borrow 5 shares from a broker while ACME is at $10/share. You pay the broker $0.10 per day in interest on the loan of the stock. 10 days later, Acme reports bad earnings and their stock tanks to $6/share. You hurry and buy 5 shares on the open market for $6 each and give them to your broker, thus closing out your short position. You pocket the difference in share price ($4 each on 5 shares, so $20) minus the interest you paid your broker ($0.10 per day for 10 days, so $1). So you made $19 on the position. This is totally legitimate and, in fact, can be an important \"price discovery\" mechanism for stock prices, maintaining equilibrium and thus keeping the market healthy.\n\nNOT FREAKING BAD! This sounds easy! In fact, that was so easy to make money that maybe we could just keep re-borrowing the same shares over and over again? Turns out this is entirely possible and allowed. After the initial short the stock is sitting in another brokerage, who can loan the share out to another short seller, and 'round and 'round we go.\n\nThe measure of over-shorted stock is known as \"short interest\", which is the percent of shares currently short sold. 100% short interest means *every* available share has been short sold. It's incredibly rare for short interest to go north of 20%. Below 10% is normal. 150% means every share has been short sold and half of them have been short sold TWICE. You get the gist.\n\n(Side note: I'd be willing to bet good money that after this whole GME thing there will be new regulations passed to prevent over-shorted stock in the future... That's a good thing that should have happened long ago. The only reason it didn't happen long ago is because Wall St (not regular investors, you need a crapton of money to pull this off) has been making money hand over fist with it for decades.)\n\nSo how does the risk/reward profile for short selling compare to that of regular stock trading? When you buy a share of stock \"normally\", the price of that stock could theoretically go up to infinity (see Tesla \ud83d\ude05). The stock could also go to $0, of course, but can't go negative. So when you buy stock \"normally\" your max gains are infinite and your max losses are 100% (you can only lose up to the total price you paid for the stock).\n\nWith short selling it's the inverse: your max gains are 100% and YOUR POTENTIAL LOSSES ARE INFINITE since the price of the stock you borrowed can go to infinity, meaning you'd have to buy at infinity to pay back your broker. Either that or you stay in your short position and keep paying interest to your broker in perpetuity...\n\n## The Squeeze\n\nOkay, we're finally ready for the squeeze... A \"short squeeze\" is the scenario where a bunch of stock is sold short and short sellers cutting their losses all at the same time causes the price to skyrocket (high buy demand = stonks go up), thereby increasing the shorties' losses and forcing them out even faster in a vicious feedback loop.\n\nShort squeezes has happened a few times in the past (VW in 2008, Blue Apron in 2020, etc.) but what's different this time is that GME's short interest has been north of 100% for MONTHS. This is absolutely INSANE and is a direct result of the hubris and arrogance of Wall St traders (more on that below). What it means is that there aren't ANY non-shorted shares available for the shorties to continue borrowing. Lots of buyers (the shorties) and no sellers. High demand, low supply, you get the point. And as long as nobody sells their GME shares (which you're allowed to do, obviously) the shorts are stuck with incredibly expensive loan interest accruing each and every day. Eventually the interest is too much and their brokers forcibly close out their positions, NO MATTER THE PRICE. And as the short shares get bought up to return to their lenders the stock price is driven up even further. Again, high buy demand = higher price.\n\n(The other thing that's different here is that every call option on GME is currently in the money, but that's a whole other novel that I won't go into here... Bottom line is that there will be lots of buying pressure over the coming weeks, which will just drive the price up faster.)\n\n## So how do the short sellers get out of this mess?\n\nThey have to buy the stock back, we know that, the question is at what price. The current run-up of GME's price is entirely detached from the fundamental valuation of the company (which is definitely not normal, but entirely legal; stocks are worth whatever the market is willing to pay for them), so the shorts hope they can outlast everyone currently holding stock, hoping that people eventually sell to cash out, thereby driving the price back down to where the shorts can take an acceptable loss (or even a profit!).\n\nThe problem for the shorts is that NOBODY IS SELLING, and they have to buy all of the shares not just once but 1.5 times (since short interest is at 150%). This is where the whole anti Wall St sentiment you may have been hearing the last couple days is coming from. As long as nobody sells the shorts are SCREWED. The price will go up indefinitely and eventually the shorts will have to fold and liquidate everything to cover their positions. Indeed, a few hedge funds are already underwater. I'm sure we'll see some bankruptcies come out of this.\n\nSo if they can't outlast us, what else can they do? From [1]:\n\n> The only way shorts can alleviate the narrative of [short squeeze] inevitably is to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD). So as long as GME stock positions are maintained, and more shares are bought, the short squeeze is inevitable.\n\nThis is exactly what they've been doing the past few days with CNBC and other mainstream media pushing the narrative that the squeeze is over (it's not, the shorts are still in), freezing buying of GME (if a stock can only be sold then the price has to go down), etc. CNBC was demonizing the \"Reddit mob\" pretty hard, but I think they gave up on that narrative because everyone knows it's complete BS (especially CNBC). The short sellers took on INFINITE risk by engaging in extremely dodgy trading strategies (driving short interest north of 100%). They chose to go outside in stormy weather without an umbrella and now they're caught in the rain. Now they're trying to change the rules on the fly.\n\nThe chairman of Interactive Brokers (the biggest broker in town who would ultimately be on the hook for the shorted shares if the hedge funds go bust) openly admitted to manipulating the stock market to \"prevent losses\" ON LIVE TV yesterday [2]. Hearing him talk in this video is actually surreal. He said they were \"preventing losses\". Who's losses, I wonder? He's \"preventing losses\" that were legitimately deserved by the short sellers. Protecting his people, the Wall St fat cats, while screwing over the independent retail investors.\n\nThat was a lot of technical details... You can read more about the mechanics of the squeeze and it's black hole singularity style physics here [3], but now let's move on to the broader implications of what's going on...\n\n## So what's all this talk about \"sticking it to Wall St\"?\n\nSocieties remain stable when everyone from the proletariat up to the elite exist in a state of symbiosis. (It would be great if there were greater equality across the board, but that's a dream for far future generations.) Oppress the proletariat long enough and eventually heads will roll (the French know something about that). In the past it was literal heads rolling, now revolutions take on other forms. But it all starts with a mismatch in power and opportunities, and then something like a pandemic throws gas on the fire. The social unrest of the past year is not surprising and everything is leading to this moment.\n\nThe feeling of collective euphoria on the Internet at the prospect of taking down our society's elite class has been palpable the past few days. Of course, it could be the biggest anti-climax in history if the squeeze falls apart (if too many retail traders sell their shares, thereby letting the shorts out of their positions), but so far it looks like everyone has \"diamond hands\" (willing to hold at all costs). Wall St is backed into a corner and has no ammo left, and \"the people\" are HUNGRY after what \"the suits\" did to the economy in 2008. Wall St tanked the economy and faced no consequences. In fact, they got bailouts!\n\nAs mentioned above, Wall St could somehow weasel their way out of this, but there's no hypothesis for a clean, legal exit. It would have to be dirty, and I don't think the politicians will allow that since they might have the literal head-rolling kind of revolution on their hands. I just can't see that happening.\n\n## Where does it end\n\nBut \"victory\" sounds incredibly complicated too... If the stock price goes up to $CRAZY there would be an unprecedented shake-up on Wall St, entire hedge funds, brokers, maybe even banks going bust. It could also push the rest of the market down as the fat cats liquidate their other positions to cover their shorts (we're already seeing this happen).\n\nIf you believe the market is currently overvalued this could be the catalyst for a broader market correction. This wouldn't be the root cause, of course, just the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nIf you believe the market is fairly valued right now then any dip resulting from HFs liquidating their positions will be temporary and the market will bounce back, much like the physics of a ripple on a pond, eventually the equilibrium will be reached. (If you believe this then get ready to buy the dip!)\n\nIt would be the biggest transfer of wealth of all time. But it could also break everything... What would it do to our economy if the fat cats on Wall St go bust? The truth is nobody really knows what happens if the stock price goes parabolic. We'll find out very soon.\n\nThe tragedy I'm seeing now, though, is the spin the media (WHICH IS OWNED BY WALL ST) is putting on this, pinning the blame on retail investors \"pumping up\" the stock. The price is going up because the shorts have to buy 150% of the shares back, and the market naturally reacts to that with an increase in the share price. People are buying because they could 1000x their money (or more), in theory at least.\n\nBut make no mistake, the root cause of this entire situation was Wall St doing something incredibly stupid and arrogant (AGAIN) by over-shorting GameStop and other stocks. They thought GameStop would go bankrupt and they'd never have to pay the piper. They've gamed this system with their formidable capital resources and inside information for decades to print money (you can see Jim Cramer brag about it live over here [4]), taking it from regular people, even destroying entire companies to get out of their short positions. Shorting more shares than there are available to trade is unfathomably stupid and should be illegal.\n\nI don't know what to think. I'm happy that Wall St is finally getting theirs, but nervous that this could literally crash the market (unlikely given how collosally huge the market is, but underlying structures are bending). The total market cap of GameStop as of right now at $325/share is $22 Billion. The government bailed out the finance industry to the tune of $1 Trillion after 2008. A \"bailout\" of 2.2% the size of the 2008 one sounds like a bargain if it meant avoiding market collapse. I hope it doesn't come to that. I hope a bunch of hedge funds go under and a bunch of regular people get rich and we go on with our lives. We'll see what happens next week!\n\nBy the way, I have already sold enough of my position (slowly over the course of the day Thursday) to recover my initial investment, so it's all house money now. I'll come out unscathed even if GME does go to $0.\n\nTHIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING SIR THIS IS A WENDY'S\n\n[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l21gpz/infinite_short_squeeze_explained_blue_appron_case/\n\n[2] https://youtu.be/7RH4XKP55fM\n\n[3] https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l5l413/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity/\n\n[4] https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4", "id": "l8ere5", "created_utc": 1611984437.0, "score": 72, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nPlease direct all simple questions towards the stickied Daily Discussion and Quarterly Rate My Portfolio threads (sort by Hot, they're at the top).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He put a short squeeze on the Vampire Squid. In 2006, Goldman Sachs GS, -1.40%  , as the great cephalopod is officially known, was shorting distressed high-yield bonds from a bathroom-fixtures manufacturer called MAAX Holdings Inc. Goldman, one of the most powerful investment banks in the world, was also encouraging its customers to do the same  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>After hearing that a firm was shorting the bonds, Falcone purchased the entire issue of bonds. He also lent the bonds to the short-sellers, and then bought them back when the traders sold them. As a result, his total exposure exceeded the entire issue of the MAAX bonds. Falcone then stopped lending the bonds, so that short-sellers could not liquidate their positions anymore. The price of the bonds rose dramatically. The short-sellers could only liquidate their positions by contacting Falcone directly.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>On June 27, 2012, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed securities fraud charges against Falcone and Harbinger Capital Partners, alleging that Falcone \"used fund assets \\[of $113.2 million\\] to pay his taxes, conducted an illegal 'short squeeze' to manipulate bond prices, secretly favored certain customers at the expense of others, and that Harbinger unlawfully bought equity securities in a public offering, after having sold short the same security during a restricted period.\"  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that New York-based hedge fund adviser Philip A. Falcone and his advisory firm Harbinger Capital Partners have agreed to a settlement in which they must pay more than $18 million and admit wrongdoing.

Then-Porsche CEO Wendelin Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation over his role in the event.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>The hedge funds \u2013 Elliott, Glenhill, Glenview and Perry Capital \u2013 filed a lawsuit at the New York Southern District Court on Monday, in an attempt to recoup large losses suffered by them after a VW share price surge triggered by Porsche\u2019s takeover attempt of Europe\u2019s largest carmaker. The funds are accusing Porsche and its former chief executive and chief financial officers, Wendelin Wiedeking and Holger H\u00e4rter, of market manipulation and of disguising their aim to buy more than 75 per cent of VW\u2019s shares in order to take full control over VW. \u201cThe complaint alleges that the defendants repeatedly misled investors and lied about Porsche\u2019s positions and intentions with respect to VW,\u201d the funds said in a press release.  \n>  \n>...  \n>  \n>Germany\u2019s highest civil court dismissed an appeal by 19 hedge funds including Viking Global Equities LP, Glenhill Capital LP and David Einhorn\u2019s Greenlight Capital Inc., Porsche Holding said Friday in a statement.

Then on Thanksgiving Day 2015, when markets were closed, Shkreli tweeted that he had decided to recall his KBIO shares that had been lent out to short sellers.

{"title": "*PG&E: a Firesale DD*", "selftext": "# Pacific Gas & Electric ($PCG) \n\nThis is my personal research into Pacific Gas & Electric Company. They have perpetuated evils on the environment and mankind. Not an endorsement- just some compiled findings. \n\nNone of this is financial advice, and is purely fiction.\n\n**MY FIRST DD AND ACTUALLY IDK WHAT I WANNA SAY BUT I RESEARCH A LITTLE SO LOOK IF U WANT, LET ME KNOW IF YOU GUYS HAVE ANY MORE TO ADD TO THIS CASE THANKS.**\n\n*General Background*\n\n>Sector: **Utilities**  \nIndustry: **Electric Utilities**  \n>  \n>PG&E Corp. is a holding company, which engages in generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and natural gas to customers. It specializes in **energy**, **utility**, **power**, **gas**, **electricity**, **solar and sustainability**.   \n>  \n>The company was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in San Francisco, CA.\n\n[CHART & FINANCIALS](https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-PCG/)\n\nPG&E has a large market cap coming in at $22.684B. And had a revenue of $17.129B.\n\nSo why does it have such a negative cash flow? \n\n    A quick glance at the EBITDA also shows a glimmer of hope. But this metric can be misleading given the nature of the utility industry. Where depreciation and amortization can way heavy on their expenses, replacing power plants and equipment over their vast network is expensive. \n\n*The Compounding Risks*\n\nYou may have heard of how catastrophic this company has been to the environment and people of CA.\n\n>In the last nine years, California has seen a growing number of unnatural disasters that have taken the lives of more than 90 people and caused more than $40 billion in damages. They all have one element in common: They were caused by California\u2019s largest investor-owned utility, Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E).\n\n[HISTORY SOURCE -- LETS OWN PG&E](https://letsownpge.org/history/)\n\nThe impacts of these events can be felt for decades. Litigation is expensive and also takes years. \n\n    For example:\n    In 2019 they paid $11B  for the California wildfires that torched wine country back in  2017 and for the Campfire in 2018 that killed 85 people and destroyed the town of Paradise, CA.\n\n[2019 $11B SETTLEMENT SOURCE](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/13/760479525/pg-e-to-pay-11-billion-insurance-settlement-over-wildfires-in-paradise-and-elsew)\n\nThe litigation expenses caught up with PG&E.\n\n**They filled chapter 11 bankruptcy on January 29th 2019.**\n\n*What is chapter 11 bankruptcy, more specifically \"debtor in possession\"?*\n\n>Chapter 11 is typically used to reorganize a business, which may be a corporation, sole proprietorship, or partnership. A corporation exists separate and apart from its owners, the stockholders. The chapter 11 bankruptcy case of a corporation (corporation as debtor) does not put the personal assets of the stockholders at risk other than the value of their investment in the company's stock. A sole proprietorship (owner as debtor), on the other hand, does not have an identity separate and distinct from its owner(s). Accordingly, a bankruptcy case involving a sole proprietorship includes both the business and personal assets of the owners-debtors. Like a corporation, a partnership exists separate and apart from its partners. In a partnership bankruptcy case (partnership as debtor), however, the partners' personal assets may, in some cases, be used to pay creditors in the bankruptcy case or the partners, themselves, may be forced to file for bankruptcy protection.  \n>  \n>Section 1107 of the Bankruptcy Code places the debtor in possession in the position of a fiduciary, with the rights and powers of a chapter 11 trustee, and it requires the debtor to perform of all but the investigative functions and duties of a trustee. These duties, set forth in the Bankruptcy Code and Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, include accounting for property, examining and objecting to claims, and filing informational reports as required by the court and the U.S. trustee or bankruptcy administrator (discussed below), such as monthly operating reports. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u00a01106, 1107; Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2015(a). The debtor in possession also has many of the other powers and duties of a trustee, including the right, with the court's approval, to employ attorneys, accountants, appraisers, auctioneers, or other professional persons to assist the debtor during its bankruptcy case. Other responsibilities include filing tax returns and reports which are either necessary or ordered by the court after confirmation, such as a final accounting. The U.S. trustee is responsible for monitoring the compliance of the debtor in possession with the reporting requirements.\n\n[US COURTS -- CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY](https://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-11-bankruptcy-basics)\n\nChapter 11 bankruptcy is going to come with added risks.\n\n* The ability to develop, consummate, and implement a plan of reorganization with respect to PG&E Corporation and the Utility during the Chapter 11 Cases that satisfies all applicable legal requirements, including the requirements of AB 1054;\n* The ability to develop and obtain applicable Bankruptcy Court, creditor, and regulatory approval of a successful plan of reorganization and the effect of any alternative proposals, views, and objections of official committees, creditors, state and federal regulators, and other stakeholders, which may make it difficult to develop and consummate a successful plan of reorganization in a timely manner and by June 30, 2020;\n* The risk that the Note-holder RSA, the Subrogation RSA, the TCC RSA or the PSAs could be terminated; So far there is compelling evidence that there are a number of headwinds going forward.\n\nThese are 3 out of 17 risks PG&E is recognizing, with the possibility of more unseen risks. \n\n[2019 PCG 10k FILLINGS](https://last10k.com/sec-filings/pcg#i_0_40)\n\n*What's next?*\n\nSo far there is compelling evidence of significant headwinds in PG&E's recovery.\n\n1. Continuing litigations and settlements are costly.\n2. Debt restructuring will come with its own risks. \n\nAs a result of the wildfires Public Safety Power Shutoff was created.\n\n**M A G I C   K A R P   T O   T H E   R E S C U E ! ! !**\n\n**January 19th, 2021**\n\nPG&E signed a multi-year, multi-million dollar contract with Palantir to provide Foundry software.\n\n>Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) has initiated deployment of Palantir\u2019s Foundry software to provide a single, integrated platform to give decision-makers a real-time, complete operational picture.  \n>  \n>The use of this novel technology, in its early stages of deployment, has already enabled PG&E to make effective, timely, data-driven decisions related to its Public Safety Power Shutoff program and is intended to further inform its wildfire risk mitigation programs and initiatives in the future.  \n>  \n>\u201cOur engagement with California\u2019s largest investor-owned utility underlines our commitment to increasing safety and reliability for customers and communities across the region,\u201d said Olivier Farache, Palantir\u2019s Head of Utility Sector and Senior Advisor to the CEO. \u201cIt shows our Foundry software can power data-driven decisions that aim to improve service delivery.\u201d\n\n[SOURCE](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210119005164/en/Palantir-Providing-Technology-to-Enhance-Safety-and-Reliability-of-Electric-Grid-in-California)\n\nThe increasing size and magnitude of PG&E's operation innately led to an increase in disasters.\n\n & Corruption within the company have slowed recovery and any efforts towards lasting change on its infrastructure.  \n\nWith the use of Foundry this could be the start of less wildfires and a more efficient utility company. \n\nThe road ahead is a tough one for PG&E. But its tempting when its stock price is at levels we have not seen since 1999. And when debt restructuring + Foundry software could change the long term out look of the company. \n\n**The play?**\n\nBull case: Foundry significantly helps mitigate disasters and debt restructuring is approved quickly... **$17c Expiring December 17th**\n\nCurrently (Jan 29th, 2021) they are priced at $0.99. \n\nGreeks: Delta=.3209 Theta=-0.0034 Gamma=.0582\n\n*^(I am not a financial advisor.
