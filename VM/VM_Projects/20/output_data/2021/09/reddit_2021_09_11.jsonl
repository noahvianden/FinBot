{"title": "I'm very bullish on $AFRM so I thought I'd share the DD conducted when the price was $67. Keen to hear others' thoughts on $AFRM and my DD.", "selftext": "**Summary:**\n\n* Affirm is a major player in the booming \u201cpoint of sale financing\u201d or \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d niche.\n* Affirm lets online shoppers choose an installment plan at checkout.\n* The point of sale financing market exploded during the pandemic and is expected to keep growing fast.\n* Competitor Afterpay was recently acquired by Square, and there is speculation that Affirm may be an acquisition target.\n\n**What they do:**\n\nAffirm operates a point-of-sale payment solution for consumers. Its payment network allows consumers to pay for purchases with an installment plan.\n\nAffirm pays the merchant the full amount upfront. They charge an APR of 10 to 30 percent, depending on the plan and on the buyer\u2019s credit. The Affirm app makes it easy for buyers to keep track of payments and sends reminders.\n\nAffirm also receives a fee from merchants. Online sellers have found that point-of-sale financing increases sales volume and reduces cart abandonment, so they are willing to pay for the service.\n\nThere were over 12,000 active merchants using the Affirm platform in March 2021, more than double the number in the same quarter of 2020. Active consumers grew 60% to 5.4 million in the same period. Gross merchandise volume grew 83% to $2.3 billion.\n\nAffirm has an exclusive relationship with Shopify ($SHOP), and provides point-of-sale financing to Shopify merchants.\n\nShopify is a leading competitor to Amazon. They are growing at a wild rate: gross merchandise volume was up 119% in the last reported quarter and the number of merchants with Shopify stores has been rising at 126% a year. Shopify now powers over 1.7 million businesses in more than 175 countries.\n\nAffirm\u2019s relationship with Shopify allows them to offer their services to an enormous and rapidly growing customer base.\n\n**Why they\u2019re spiking in interest:**\n\nReddit mentions of $AFRM in the last 8 days leaped 875% from the previous 8-day period.\n\nThe surge was kicked off by the August 3 news that Affirm will work with Apple ($AAPL) to provide installment plans for Apple device purchasers in Canada.\n\nThat announcement was followed on August 5 with news that Square ($SQ) is acquiring Australian buy-now-pay-later provider Afterpay for $29 billion. Affirm shares gained 18% on the combined news.\n\nThe Square/Afterpay combination will provide competition for Affirm, but it also brought attention to the sector.\n\nThere has been speculation that another major player seeking to move into the buy-now-pay-later space will acquire Affirm rather than develop their own system.\n\nShopify (which already owns 7.6% of Affirm), PayPal, and even card giants like Visa and Mastercard have been suggested as potentially interested in acquiring Affirm.\n\nNotable comments from Reddit:\n\n\"I\u2019m long on $AFRM. The financial sector is dinosaurs through and through. If you\u2019ve ever applied for (and received) a mortgage, it\u2019s a nightmare. It requires little imagination on my part for Affirm or \u201cGreen Sky\u201d to open up to home and auto loans.\"\n\n\\- PinBot1138\n\n\u201cPeople should probably get AFRM for when it gets acquired for a free 30%.\u201d- Lukebreit\n\nSignal: Over 77% of the $AFRM float is held by institutions. Scottish investment management firm Baillie Gifford is the largest institutional holder, with over $75 million worth of shares.\n\n**Why $AFRM could be valuable:**\n\nThe buy-now-pay-later has enormous upward momentum. Sales have increased dramatically and the increase is expected to continue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMcKinsey & Company\u2019s annual POS Financing Survey found that about 60% of consumers are likely to use point-of-sale financing over the next six to 12 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAffirm founder and CEO Max Levchin has a record of developing successful and innovative payment systems: he\u2019s one of the founders of PayPal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAffirm does not charge late payment fees and has a fixed monthly payment system. This feature is attractive to users who are concerned with the complexities of credit card billing and payment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAffirm\u2019s Net Promoter Score - a measure of customer loyalty - places the company at 78, above Amazon and just below Apple. 64% of transactions are from repeat users, and repeat customers spend an average of $2,200 per year. Delinquency rates were just over 1% in 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSix of 10 analysts covering the stock rate it \u201cBuy\u201d, with the other 4 placing it at \u201cHold\u201d. The consensus price target is $76.71, 14% above the current level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRapid user growth, high customer retention, and a rapidly expanding market add up to very strong growth prospects for $AFRM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe stock has dropped to under 50% of its post-IPO surge of $140 per share and has settled into a steady band in the $60-$70 range.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPost-IPO hype often drives new listings to unrealistic valuations. When they drop back to a more realistic level many retail investors become frustrated and drop out. That leaves a core of institutional holders and a strong base for appreciation of positive news.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What the risks are:**\n\nAffirm is not profitable and is not expected to achieve profitability soon. The Company also has a high debt/equity ratio of 87.95%. The Company has adequate working capital but the combination of debt and losses is still a concern.\n\nAffirm operates in a highly competitive market. Right now that market is dominated by relatively new companies like Afterpay, and Klarna. The sector\u2019s rapid growth could attract competition from larger companies with greater financial capacity than Affirm.\n\nAffirm faces credit risk. Default rates have been extremely low, but unexpected events could drive them high enough to affect the Company\u2019s results.\n\nAffirm is exposed to a potential economic downturn. A recession could reduce the discretionary purchases that drive much of the Company\u2019s gross merchandise volume and increase default rates.\n\nThe buy-now-pay-later sector could attract increased government regulation, which could affect the Company's results and stock price.\n\n***Bottom line:***\u00a0*Affirm\u2019s lack of profitability makes it a speculative play. But its rapid revenue growth and established position in an exploding market make it an interesting speculative play. There is strong potential for acquisition and for medium to long-term growth.

{"title": "Why the \ud83d\udc0a is ready to CHOMP", "selftext": "TLDR: If we do crash due to a volatility event, don't expect buying the dip to be easy. A 2% dip on bad news could easily send the market tumbling further, and SPY VIX \ud83d\udc0a gonna eat a nice \ud83d\udda8\ufe0f. Y'all gotten too used to low realized volatility, when it's likely it could come boiling up at any point this month.\n\nthink about an institution selling some 420p 10/15 at the moment and what would need to happen for \"smart money\" to do what makes it smart if SPY were to dump to 430 and volatility pump over 30. With that rise in volatility that comes with the drop, the range in price relative to the strike in which dealers must hedge increases, but they don't have to change their hedges as often due to options being less exposed to movements in price. In this example, a dealer being sold OTM puts would hedge by actually buying some of the stock. However, when that strike is crossed, the (what is typically an) MM that the institution sold the OTM puts to must now hedge by SHORTING the stock. Who else must now do this? The institutions, smart money, or \ud83d\udc02 boomers selling the puts! However, these boomers are oftentimes fairly confident in the dip being bought up and on top of that, they don't dynamically hedge in a way that Market Makers do that provides liquidity to the market in either direction. They just buy some SPY 420p 10/15, smoke a boomer bowl, and call it a day. \n\nThis is what makes that dumbass \ud83d\udc0aVIX SPY comparison seem right at the moment- and it is right in a way, but you won't make money with FDs on it. When bullish attitudes increase, MMs are forced to provide liquidity to the market, and JPow with the printer was basically the alley-oop to some slam dunk performances by team \ud83d\udc02. However, this exposes all those institutions and boomers - who are forcing MMs to provide liquidity to the market by selling them puts and calls - heavily toward volatility, and while it's currently forcing MMs to provide SHITLOADS of ink, they \"won't always need to* based on what options people are buying.\n\nTHIS is why this \ud83d\udc0a has it's mouth out of the water and is ready to chomp on a freshly slaughtered \ud83d\udda8\ufe0f. The very news of the \ud83d\udda8\ufe0f shutting off - the printer being liquidity the fed provides - will increase volatility (as it is right now), and FORCE market makers to take away even more liquidity. Then, when the customer side put sellers can smell the lack of ink, they're basically gonna turn those bitches into bearish put spreads and also be increasing volatility. This increase in volatility knocks more strikes into the range at which MMs must sell MORE shares in order to be delta hedged, only increasing the amount they short as time moves on.\n\nI've learned this all from Squeeze Metrics \"The Implied Order Book\", and his recent AMAZING analysis on historical put flow and VIX/Gamma exposure ratio he posted to Twitter. He is basically saying that put flow is increasing to the point at which we can see volatility exposure syphoning money from the system at an alarming rate with any significant drop.\n\nBear markets will never last if they are caused by volatility events because the MMs will just go ahead and be the first ones to short volatility, mainly because they need to fill the demand for OTM options. BUT, don't think we couldn't see spy sit down and smoke a bowl at 4:20 o' clock. \n\nThe \ud83d\udc0a is warming up with some delicious printer ink pasta.
