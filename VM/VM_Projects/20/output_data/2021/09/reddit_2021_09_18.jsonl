{"title": "Some Useful Stock Alerts I Use", "selftext": "One thing I've done over the past year and a half was try to teach myself some tools of technical analysis so I could better avoid getting my knees chopped off as happened in February-March of 2020. I started using [Stockcharts.com](https://Stockcharts.com), which is an outstanding platform that also puts out some great videos every week (the best being The Final Bar with David Keller). One thing I've enjoyed is being able to set alerts for the stock I both own and follow. Here are some of the alerts I've been using in case this is helpful to anyone. These are easy to implement using the Stockcharts alert/scan engine.\n\nFirst, Stochastics hitting 80% after being above, or 20% after being below, tells me when a stock or ETF is \"letting off the gas\" and will stop going up, or has started \"hitting the gas\" and might start to up. This is usually the first heads up that I should pay attention to something as I hate kicking myself later for not catching when things start a move.\n\nMACD crossovers for all the stocks I follow is also helpful. Basically I get one email alert per day and can mark which are start to dip, or rise.\n\nObviously, moving average crossovers are good to get notifications for.\n\nHaving alerts that tell me when a stock's SCTR rating (a comparison of how that stock is doing to all other stocks) 25, 50 or 75 in a bullish manner (hitting from below) or bearish (hitting from above, due to the stock falling) helps me from missing stuff returning to an uptrend after taking a break.\n\nI'm also testing a trend-following system by Authur Hill that uses Stochastics on a 125 day period, as a final system to tell me when I should or should not be in stocks. Any stock that hits 40 is a \"sell\" and 60 is a \"buy,\" which I just use as another piece of information so I don't miss stuff.\n\nI have an alert that tells me if anything in the S&P 500 has a downtrend reversal. In theory, every stock returning to an uptrend will give off this signal and I can at least take note of it. \n\nThis system isn't perfect since I get a ton of alerts right when the market opens (which is 10:30 pm for me as I'm in Japan), but it's a nice way to get an impression of what's moving and why.\n\nHope this is helpful to anyone.
