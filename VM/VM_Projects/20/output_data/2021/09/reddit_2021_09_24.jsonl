{"title": "Ford ($F) Should Invest in Piedmont Lithium ($PLL), Sayona ($SYA), and IronRidge Resources ($IRR) Next.", "selftext": "Full Disclosure: I'm long PLL. The following is not financial advice, please do your own research and come to your own conclusions.\n\nBelow is a walkthrough of why I think Ford will invest in Piedmont Lithium which should materially move the stock.\n\nSummary (TL/DR):\n\n* Ford investing further upstream in US EV battery supply chain with JV in battery cells (SK Innovation factories in GA) and this week's investment in cathode active materials (Redwood Materials factory TBD but planned to be Eastern US)\n* Makes sense they would next target the final piece: refining and mining raw materials like lithium\n* For Ford's lithium needs, Piedmont Lithium (PLL) with its partnerships with Sayona and IronRidge makes the most sense: local to US (North Carolina lithium hydroxide refineries), local N. Carolina mine with strategic additional feedstock from Sayona Quebec (ASX:SYA, OTC:SYAFX), and IronRidge Resources in Ghana (London AIM:IRR).\n* PLL open-pit mining and concentrating spodumene is proven and low risk. How market leaders in China operate today using spodumene from Australia to convert to lithium hydroxide.\n* PLL utilizing Metso Outotec (Finnish company) environmentally sound sulfate-free spodumene-to-hydroxide chemical plant to refine raw material concentrate into battery grade lithium chemicals. Same plant flowsheet as Tesla's although not confirmed yet but see my [deep dive post](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lmbhv7/piedmont_lithium_deep_dive_nasdaq_pll_asx_pll/) for details.\n* PLL will have Definitive-Feasibility-Study-Ready project (DFS expected 2H 2021)\n* PLL already vetted by Tesla. PLL supplying Tesla with spodumene feedstock for Tesla's own hydroxide facility in Texas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Ford Joint Ventures and Investments for US EV Supply Chain](https://preview.redd.it/cq83oynb9dp71.png?width=1058&format=png&auto=webp&s=c804d5a02f844b1ea6437b059c8b8800ec898909)\n\nLast big post I wrote was a deep dive into PLL when the shares were trading at $55 back in Feb 2021. They're back to $55 range today, down from a high of $88 so far this year. \n\nFord recently announced a strategic investment in Redwood Materials, a battery recycling and fledgling cathode and anode company. JB Straubel (founder and former Tesla CTO) is the CEO. \n\nCathodes are why we call certain batteries NMC (Nickel-Manganese-Cobalt) or NCA (Nickel-Cobalt-Aluminum), etc. Cathodes are sold in the form of powders to battery cell manufacturers like SK Innovation, Panasonic, and LG Chem to make batteries. Today, most of the cathode powders are produced in China. Lithium powders (carbonate and hydroxide) likewise are also mainly produced in China (in the case of lithium hydroxide > 80% of the world's supply is from China).\n\nRedwood just announced they plan to build 100GWh per year capacity of cathode materials by 2025 and 500GWh per year of capacity by 2030. For perspective, the Tesla Gigafactory in Nevada today pumps out \\~35GWh per year of battery cells (so it uses more than 35GWh per year of cathode material, slightly more due to the yield loses in manufacturing).\n\nUS and European Automakers have all announced multi-billion dollar EV programs and have talked about localizing the supply chain from shipping materials 1000s of km away from China to shipping things 100s of km within North America or Europe. They started with joint ventures with battery cell manufacturers (Ford/SK Innovation, Tesla/Panasonic/CATL/LG Chem, Rivian/Samsung, GM/LG Chem, VW/Northvolt/LG Chem/SK Innovation/Samsung/CATL). Yesterday marked the first JV of a US OEM with a cathode company (and anode and recycling).\n\nNow the question remains will one or either or both of them invest in a refining and mining company for the EV raw materials like Lithium, Nickel, Manganese, Cobalt, Graphite, etc?\n\nI believe the answer is yes and Ford will invest in Piedmont Lithium.\n\nOf particular interest are the following excerpts from [Redwood's Press Release](https://www.redwoodmaterials.com/press/redwood-materials-and-ford-motor-company-announce-strategic-relationship) (emphasis my own):\n\n\"It\u2019s been incredible to see the tide change as so many automakers commit to a fully electric future. However, **we need to plan far ahead for the increased demand of materials that this transition will create**.\u00a0 We also **must manage supply chain risks** carefully around lithium-ion batteries or **we risk a repeat of the semiconductor production shortages causing chaos in the world today**.\"\n\n\"While few automakers are thinking far ahead, **Ford stands apart in their long-term strategic understanding** that these complex issues **present an incredible opportunity**. Redwood and Ford share an understanding that to truly make electric vehicles sustainable and affordable, **we need to localize the existing complex and expensive supply chain network**, create pathways for end-of-life vehicles, ramp lithium-ion recycling and increase battery production, all right here in America.\"\n\nThe above points to the lithium companies in the US. Other companies have technology risk like Lithium Americas ($LAC) in Nevada with its clay deposit. To date, they have not produced the final lithium product that goes into a battery (carbonate or hydroxide) only lithium sulfate a precursor with many impurities. They're also planning to use a sulfuric acid flowsheet, something Tesla is shying away from for their own lithium clay extraction technology.\n\nPLL has its own potential issues with mining permitting delays and local politics of rezoning currently residential property to business and mining use.\n\nHowever, if these issues come to pass as expected, Piedmont will have a DFS ready project, vetted by Tesla, and they're utilizing a novel sulfate-free environmentally friendly (and lower capex and opex) lithium chemical refinery to produce lithium hydroxide.\n\nHydroxide versus carbonate is another topic but suffice it to say the following tweet points to Redwood being a customer for lithium hydroxide: larger battery packs = higher nickel batteries compared to say iron phosphate. Higher nickel batteries require lithium hydroxide due to sintering process when combining the lithium powders with the nickel cathode powders.\n\n[Redwood Reply Highlighting Larger Battery Packs =\\> High Nickel + Li Hydroxide](https://preview.redd.it/1zsviktu7dp71.png?width=593&format=png&auto=webp&s=d33e8d2ce2dad82b950fc2678b4423378d5a979c)\n\nSince Redwood needs lithium (and other materials) to manufacture batteries, and since Ford has capital and strategic needs, it makes sense that Ford should choose PLL to shore up its investments in the EV supply chain.\n\nLastly, my wild guess at a possible Ford deal:\n\n* Investment total of $500M\n* $180M equity for 20% of PLL (valuing it at $900M Market Cap)\n* $320M for 40% of the Carolina Lithium project economics\n* Lithium Hydroxide binding offtake for 50% Life of Carolina Lithium Project at calculated price based on market spot with price cap and floor\n\nPiedmont needs about $800M total to build their first 30ktpy integrate mine + hydroxide refinery so $500M from Ford and then a possible $300M Dept of Energy loan under the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing program gets this project fully funded and then they're off.\n\nThanks for reading.", "id": "pucfon", "created_utc": 1632458068.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for your backgrounder above.

Or they\u2019d focus on building a hydroxide refinery in Quebec or Europe which would be a sad outcome for the US. As you probably know, Piedmont does own 60 acres of land in Kings Mountain (adjacent county) that was the original location of the hydroxide refinery until the latest June scoping study moved the refinery next to the mine in Gaston County.

I never intended to long term hold margin.\n\nIn the spring, I took a big position in AAPL when it dipped under $130.  It kept going down so I kept buying.  That position is up quite nicely.
