Sea Ltd operates in Southeast Asia hence the name SEA. SEA is comprised of three businesses: Gardena, shopee, and Sea Money. \n\nGarena is a mobile game company which has the worlds most actively played game, Free Fire (at least it was when I last checked on it a month or two ago). Free Fire is a battle royale type game that players spend money on skins etc.Shopee is an e commerce similar to Shopify or amazon. And Sea Money is a mobile banking company similar to square that ties into Shopee. \n\nThe financials are incredible and are as followed (in millions and rounded): 2017- 415, 2018- 826, 2019- 2175, 2020 through 3 quarters- 2,808. \n\nYes, the company is still unprofitable but that is because they are heavily investing in the business and the logistics within the company.

He\u2019s got a degree in engineering and an MBA in business from Stanford.

But as you know Alibaba is having major troubles at home, in China. On top of that, they were not awarded a mobile banking license, SEA was. To my knowledge (from reading not living there) is that there is a deep distrust of the Chinese party and anything directly related to the Chinese. This could play a role in their slower growth in the region. Speaking of the region, there are around 600 million people in Southeast Asia, double the market of the United States. Many of these countries as well SEA is investing heavily into digitizing them. \n\nFurthermore, there have been recent reports that SEA may be entering the South American market, another under served region with 600 million people. Although I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll face stiffer competition from MercadoLibre than their currently facing against Alibaba. \n\nOp, If you\u2019re going to own a company and post about it online at least understand the business.
