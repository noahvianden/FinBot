Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/26/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-26-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Stocks try to recover from Thursday\u2019s tech rout\n\n> * U.S. stock futures were choppy as tech stocks tried to recover from Thursday\u2019s rout that dragged the Nasdaq down 3.5% for its worst single-day performance since October. Tesla fell slightly again in Friday\u2019s premarket, a day after sinking 8% in a brutal week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday sank 559 points, or 1.8%, from a record closing high the previous session. The Dow had its worst day in nearly a month and so did the S&P 500, which lost almost 2.5%. The culprit behind the selloff was the rapid rise in bond yields.\n\n> * All three stock benchmarks were tracking for weekly losses. Ahead of Friday\u2019s trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was clinging to a gain for February, which started off strong. The Nasdaq was down nearly 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The Dow and S&P 500 both remain solidly in the green for the month. However, the S&P 500 was off almost 2.7% from its last record closing high, also on Feb. 12.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. 10-year Treasury yield retreats slightly from one-year high\n\n> * The 10-year Treasury yield retreated Friday morning, but remained above 1.4%, after surging to 1.6% in the previous session to its highest level since February 2020 and more than 0.5% higher since the end of January. The spike in the 10-year yield, which is used as a benchmark for mortgage rates and auto loans, has been driven by expectations of improving economic conditions as coronavirus vaccines are rolled out, as well as fears of higher inflation.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. House to pass Covid bill; Senate official says no minimum wage\n\n> * Inflation worries are being stoked on the thought that the $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus bill \u2014 which is seen passing the House on Friday \u2014 on top of accelerating growth could overheat the economy. Democrats on Capitol Hill are trying to push their relief measure, including a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour, through without GOP support. However, a key nonpartisan official, the Senate parliamentarian, ruled Democrats cannot include the minimum wage increase in the bill. The decision means the Senate will likely pass a different version of the bill than the House, and representatives will have to approve the plan a second time.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. FDA panel to vote on J&J\u2019s single-shot Covid vaccine\n\n> * A key FDA vaccine advisory panel is set to vote Friday on whether to recommend approval of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s Covid-19 single-shot for emergency use, which would help pave the way to for a third preventive treatment in the U.S. While the full FDA doesn\u2019t have to follow the vaccine committee\u2019s recommendation, it often does. During similar requests by Pfizer and Moderna for vaccines, the FDA authorized those companies\u2019 two-shot regimes a day after the panel of outside medical advisors backed emergency use authorization.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. DoorDash stock falls after company drops first results since IPO\n\n> * As more and more Americans are vaccinated and the economy continues to open up more fully, companies like DoorDash, which has benefited from the stay-at-home trade, could get hurt. In its first report as a public company, the food delivery service old shareholders it expects some of the tailwinds it experienced from stay-at-home orders across the U.S. will turn around once the country gets the virus under control. Shares sank 10% in Friday premarket. Even with that drop, DoorDash would still be up nearly 50% from its $102 per share offer price back in December. While DoorDash late Thursday reported $970 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, which beat estimates, it also reported an adjusted per-share loss of $2.67.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/nQ4OULP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fSUwJLJ.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/CLJNnMp7/econcal3.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/L8XVtdHp/econcal1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.postimg.cc/66cRYHb5/ipos1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/9Mn4Hk6G/eram01.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/AqrZ1zR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/x1Vhf1Yd/Screenshot-2021-02-25-at-4-26-19-PM.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/5NCDWFhG/Screenshot-2021-02-25-at-4-26-56-PM.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/DfDRNcML/Screenshot-2021-02-25-at-4-27-32-PM.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/iVbXewC.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/dVbYwpGv/divical1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/GhSRSH24/divical2.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/13nSxsnJ/divical3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.postimg.cc/dt0vB8qM/divical4.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* RKT\nvDKNG\n* QQQ\n* CDXC\n* BYND\n* SPY\n* ARKK\n* CRM\n* NNDM\n* GS\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/26/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-foot-locker-beyond-meat-doordash-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Foot Locker (FL)** \u2013 Foot Locker shares tanked 12.1% in premarket trading after quarterly revenue came in below Street forecasts and comparable-store sales unexpectedly declined.

{"title": "OSK vs WKHS (Let's Talk About the Madness)", "selftext": "This is a discussion for the people who were following the USPS contract drama. Everything that I am posting here is partial speculation. I am more than happy for you to shit on my post or downvote me to oblivion. I would just like to kindly ask you to post your positions.\n\n**(Full Disclosure: I still have 4/16 115 Calls)**\n\nI have put TLDR's in the beginning and after each key paragraph because I know you are all lazy cunts.\n\n**(TLDR: WKHS was on the brink of going BK, so there was massive manipulation in the market to make sure the suits would lose less money.OSK was thrown as bait, causing its price increase from the USPS contract to fall straight back down. The reason is that OSK is a sustainable company with great financials and can withstand it.)**\n\nDisclaimer: I am not a financial advisor of any sort. This is my opinion, and it should not be taken as the word of God. Full disclosure, I am also fucking retarded, and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself. This is also based on my theories and speculation.\n\nAs some of you may know OSK (Oshkosh) was rewarded the USPS contract for the new fleet of vehicles. It was a contract for $480M to finalize production for next-generation Vehicles. The total contract can be worth up to $6B to supply 50,000 to 165,000 over 10 years. Once the news broke out, OSK went from \u2248$103 to \u2248$118 high. This is about a 14.5% increase in the value of the company, which is \u2248 1B in market cap value. With OSK\u2019s TTM revenue of 7.2B, it gave them a multiple of revenue of \u22481.12x. The TTM EBITDA $668M, which calculates \u2248 11.9 times multiple. These multiples do not account for the projected revenue and EBITDA with the new USPS contract. The industry average on EBITDA multiples is around 13.8 times for manufacturing companies. The average multiple for auto & trucking is 45.73 times, according to [NYU Stearns](http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/vebitda.html). Without the projections of  EBITDA gains from the USPS contract, it is already extremely undervalued based on (Enterprise Value/ EBITDA).\n\n**(TLDR: Even if OSK was at the all-time high of $118 per share, it was still undervalued by approximately 32 times, using TTM numbers (****No projections and based on USPS gains****). This is based on the auto and trucking industry standards for public companies. In other words, it didn\u2019t matter if OSK got the USPS contract or not. It was still way undervalued.)**\n\nI am screaming at the top of my lungs that OSK is undervalued, so you are probably wondering why OSK fell like a ton of bricks back to $104 when the News about **One House Democrat** cried foul play on the USPS deal. \n\n**Whatever I am going to say now is partially theory pulled based on available information online. I would love for anyone to call me out if I may be wrong but post your positions also.**\n\nThis is where Workhorse plays a big role in the movement of OSK stock. As some of you might have noticed, WKHS\u2019s value dropped by nearly 50% after it was announced that OSK was awarded the contract rather than WKHS. Some may agree and some might disagree, but WKHS was banking on the contract to essentially survive. In other words, it was a Hail Mary that would have saved them from all their struggles. I am not going to go into enterprise value and EBITDA ratios with WKHS or any of that because they only have a TTM revenue of \u2248500K. You read right 500k not 500M. It would just be a waste of my time.\n\nThis is really scary because WKHS has a lot of debt on its books. As of 9/30/2020 WKHShad a net debt of $123.228M. Additionally,[ WKHS raised an additional 200M](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/workhorse-gets-200-million-to-advance-electric-van-production). This adds up to around 323M in debt, assuming they did not pay any off from 9/30. There was no way for WKHS to service that debt without bringing in new revenue. If they are not able to service the debt based on historical numbers, how are they going to service the new debt? The Creditors approved debt as they were betting on WKHS getting the USPS contract. WKHS had some really good investment bankers, or the underwriters need to be fired because this was pure speculation, which is a big bet for debt financing. As the news came out two days ago that OSK was awarded the contract, WKHS went tits up. Even though the terms on the loans did not require WKHS to repay Debt until 2024, creditors felt the pressure as WKHS lost the contract. Additionally, the value of the company decreased by half, leading to any debt convertible to stocks being less valuable. If creditors do not feel that a company is capable of serving a debt, they can recall the loan anytime (Correct me if I am wrong). This probably was going to happen. They were flirting with [insolvency](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/workhorse-share-collapse-raises-pressure-131704051.html), and all their investors would have lost their investment. The largest investor before all this drama was not ARK. It was your big institutions and mutual funds ([ie. Blackrock Inc., Vanguard Group, Inc. (The), and Seaport Global Asset Management, LLC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WKHS/holders?p=WKHS)), and they would have lost a lot of money.\n\n**(TLDR Paragraph: WKHS was close to being insolvent if creditors decided to pull the plug. They had all the reason to with WKHS losing the race for the USPS contract.)**\n\n**(Disclaimer: this is Speculation and Theories)**\n\nWhat does this have to do with OSK going down? They both have the same largest institutional investors backing the stock ([Blackrock and Vanguard](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/quote/OSK/holders?p=OSK)). Within a day after the news that Blackrock would have lost \u2248$185M in value and Vanguard would have lost \u2248$137M, assuming they did not sell any shares after 12/31/2020. They both would have made only \u224870M from the OSK stock price jump. This leaves them with the choice of the small gain from OSK or large losses from WKHS. If these institutions let WKHS sink, they would have lost all their investment, which was approximately an additional $150M for Blackrock and $100M for Vanguard. These are just calculations for 2 of the institutional investors. It is clearly a larger cost for institutions letting WKHS go BK without some gains rather than letting OSK jump up from the news. The Creditors also would have lost a lot of money if this were to happen as there will be unserviced debt and a loss in value in the convertible stocks. Even if OSK went down, the suits would not have lost much money because OSK can sustain itself without the USPS contract. With OSK\u2019s management, OSK has grown year over year. This is not just enterprise value. They grew revenue and EBIT every year before the Covid since the CEO has been in place.\n\n**(TLDR Paragraph: Big money and Creditors would have lost big by letting WKHS go BK. It is okay for OSK to fall in the short term because it is undervalued and they proved they can grow year over year.)**\n\nThis where a lot of manipulation might be happening behind the scenes. There was a bunch of shorting and options activity during this time. This was probably institutional investors hedging their bets to make up for losses. For example, ARK bought multiple dips on WKHS as the stock plummeted from the news. They nearly doubled their position. By the timing of god himself, news came out merely hours claiming House Dem will push back hard on USPS decision to choose OSK. This is apparently one House Democrat crying foul play, not the whole house, where the title tries to mislead you into thinking. Since OSK was linked to the USPS contract, it fell with regards to the news. In my opinion way too much as I believe it is extremely undervalued. There might also be additional selling to exacerbate the WKHS dump. As I finish writing this, WKHS was a clear buy and sell scheme with news that was over-exaggerated and probably paid for to minimize huge losses that would have come with WKHS insolvency. The people who would bear the pain are people who believed that WKHS is a good company. I have seen people comparing WKHS to Nikola, stating how it was undervalued compared to each other. What they don\u2019t understand is that they were comparing garbage to garbage. With this belief that Woods can do no wrong, a bunch of people jumped over the cliff.\n\n(TLDR Paragraph: OSK had to take the fall for WKHS while the markets were manipulated to prop up WKHS, so the suits would not have to take as big of a loss. The pain was transferred to the retail investors as a sea of retailer investors followed Cathie Woods into buying the dip.)\n\n**Positions: OSK (4/16 $115 Call), ELY, SBUX, T, GME**", "id": "lsq8qv", "created_utc": 1614315154.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "Contract has already been awarded to osk, wkhs people are holding on to false hopes.

{"title": "Roblox DD Part 2: What the financials say, and how that ties into future viability for the company", "selftext": "Hello again r/stocks. The other day I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lrk8uv/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/) with my product/customer analysis on Roblox using my thoughts and knowledge having dealt with the platform since its early days. I believe my insight was important as it gave information and understanding about the platform from a perspective that can't be found in any traditional analysis. If you plan to read this post and haven\u2019t read that one already, I encourage you start there. I don't expect any grown adult to engage with the product themselves to do their own DD (unless they play with their kids or something like that).\n\nThe post blew up both here and on the [identical thread in r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrl4qf/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/), more than I was expecting them to. A lot of good points and discussion was had, and as such, I feel the need to follow up with some more information. I was able to simply edit the r/investing thread, however, one of the links I edited with on r/stocks was disallowed and the post was deleted. So, here's my part 2 with the information you guys missed from the other thread's edits.\n\nA lot of people asked how I could conclude a large percentage of Roblox's player base is bots that prey on kid's accounts or inactive users.  That is more of an anecdote than something you can back up with hard numbers and data, because it\u2019s obviously not something Roblox tracks itself. Every group and comments section on Roblox is plagued by bots spamming fishy links that take you to places for \u201cfree Robux\u201d and such. There\u2019s a game on Roblox called New User Machine that tracks the total amount of players and shows the most recently created ones. Basically, it\u2019s a conveyer belt of bots with random letter & number usernames. I took that info, compared the total player base to the active one, and made my conclusion that their security and captcha are lacklustre. Their registered user count of **2.4 billion** is not impressive when compared with the daily active user (DAU) count of around **30 million**.\n\nMoving on to the financial side...\n\n[Here is Roblox's S-1 form.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm) I want to specifically focus on a few sections:\n\n>***We have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.***  \n>  \n>We have incurred net losses since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net losses in the near future. We incurred net losses of $97.2\u00a0million, $86.0\u00a0million, and $203.2\u00a0million for the years ended December\u00a031, 2018 and 2019, and the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2020, respectively. As of September\u00a030, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $484.0\u00a0million. We also expect our operating expenses to increase significantly in future periods, and **if our** **DAU growth does not increase to offset these anticipated increases in our operating expenses, our business, results of operations, and financial condition will be harmed, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability**. We expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods as we intend to continue to make significant investments to grow our business. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth of our business. In addition to the expected costs to grow our business, we also expect to incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses as a newly public company. If we fail to increase our revenue to sufficiently offset the increases in our operating expenses, we will not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future.\n\nRoblox is currently relying upon their Daily Active Users (DAU) to increase past their record all-time high to achieve profitability after a history of net loss. This record was achieved mostly likely due to the current pandemic keeping kids locked inside. They touch on this here:\n\n>***We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods, and our recent growth rates may not be indicative of our future growth or the growth of our market.***  \n>  \n>We have experienced rapid growth in the three months ended June\u00a030, 2020, September\u00a030, 2020 and for a portion of the three months ended March\u00a031, 2020, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic given our users have been online more as a result of global COVID-19 shelter-in-place policies. For example, our bookings increased 171% from the nine-months ended September\u00a030, 2019 to the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2020. We do not expect these activity levels to be sustained, and in future periods we expect growth rates for our revenue to decline, and we may not experience any growth in bookings or our user base during periods where we are comparing against COVID-19 impacted periods (i.e. the three months ended March\u00a031, 2020, June 30, 2020, and September 30, 2020). Our historical revenue, bookings and user base growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. We believe our overall acceptance, revenue growth and increases in bookings depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:  \n>  \n>\u2022 **expand the number of developers, creators, and users on our platform;**  \n>  \n>\u2022 **provide excellent customer experience and customer support for our developers, creators, and users;**  \n>  \n>**\u2022 increase global awareness of our brand.**\n\nThe bolded bullet points here tie in directly with points I have mentioned in my original post, along with this section here:\n\n>***We depend on our developers to create digital content that our users find compelling, and our business will suffer if we are unable to entertain our users, improve the experience of our users, or properly incentivize our developers and creators to develop content.***  \n>  \n>Our platform enables our developers to create experiences and virtual items, which we refer to as user generated content. Our platform relies on our developers to create experiences and virtual items on our platform for our users to acquire and/or use. Our users interact with these experiences, which are largely **free** to engage with.\n\nLargely free to engage with - this echoes my previous sentiment in which few players are really seen spending money on this game, at least compared to the amount who don't.\n\nSo, all that being said, where do we stand currently?\n\n* Roblox has developers bringing in millions of dollars, with one of them reportedly bringing in $50 million as of 2020.\n   * Another thing to note here that I thought was funny was the President mentioning his Roblox account being a company goal. Ambitious, or last-ditch effort at marketing?\n   * This information is taken from the [2020 Roblox Developer's Conference.](https://blog.roblox.com/2020/07/rdc-2020-recap/)\n* Roblox has an Amazon store selling merchandise and toys, the latter of which are also available in stores worldwide.\n   * The link to this is available in the [r/investing thread's 1st edit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrl4qf/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/)\n* Roblox runs its own data centers to deliver its platform.\n   * For the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2019, direct infrastructure costs were $58.2\u00a0million, or 13% of bookings, and grew by 66% to $96.8\u00a0million, or 8% of bookings, in the nine months ended September\u00a030, 2020.\n      * This data is taken from the S-1 form.\n\nSo, it's clear that the company is well cemented and has elements that should signify growth, but it's still unclear why such significant investment and presence in the online video game market has not yet translated to profit. This makes it difficult for me to make a bull case for $RBLX. The DPO on March 10th is expected to be around $45. Had this offering been in the single digits or teens, I believe a great long value play could've been made. For me, $45 is a bit too rich for my blood for a company that is hinging on continued growth past the pandemic and a lot of other things going right that should have already happened in the last 16 years that they have been in business.\n\nMoving on...\n\n[This comment chain from the r/investing thread is a great read and offers the developer insight I was looking for in the original thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrl4qf/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/gooabb3/?context=3) A lot of Roblox's viability for future growth hinges on continuing to grow as a game engine & platform rather than just a social platform for kids that happens to have games. Here are my thoughts on that, as things stand now.\n\nFor Roblox to be taken more seriously as a game engine, like Unity or Unreal, they need to continue to rebrand and move past the image of \"kid's Lego game/Minecraft alternative\", which will consume even more capital than they're already investing, not to mention the costs of simply going public. Their VC funding last year leading to their 30M valuation is 7x bigger than the funding of the previous year. Whether that symbolizes huge future growth or dumping the company on retail investors as a backup is up to your belief in the company.\n\nThe game engine uses Lua, and it has improved a lot in the past years. There are some images showing what's possible on the [r/investing thread's 1st edit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lrl4qf/thoughts_from_my_personal_experience_with_roblox/) Looks great, right? Yes, but their target demographic doesn't have cutting-edge PCs that can run those graphics. From their S1:\n\n>68% of our engagement hours on the platform were from users who signed up through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.\n\nThese kids play on tablets, not supercomputers. That being said, any game developed in Roblox needs to work with the economy of the website. Unity and Unreal don't suffer from this, because they were never a social platform for kids. Whether or not that is a limiting factor to growth depends on the games developers want to make. You must also keep in mind that whatever is developed on Roblox needs to be gobbled up by an age group that is predominantly under 13. From their S1:\n\n>For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 54% of our users were under the age of 13.\n\nA lot of accounts could have fake birthdays, lending further to the idea of a young player base. As a result, complex games with cutting-edge industry tech isn't the cash cow here. This means that all the money invested in improving the platform might not result in tangible returns.

{"title": "Stock Market Isn't Overvalued - Bond Rates at all time lows, Stimulus coming", "selftext": "**1st point**: Recently did some research for a college course where I analyzed the Buffett Indicator. For those unfamiliar with the metric, it divides total stock market cap by current US GDP. According to Indicator, the market is overvalued higher than it ever has been. However, if you calculate the correlation between the 10-Year US Treasury bond and the Buffett Indicator over the last 50 years, they are negatively correlated with a coefficient of -.9 (-1 would be perfectly inversely related). Basically, when bond yields are low, the Buffett Indicator (and stock valuations) are higher. If you look at the data from the \".com\" bubble in 2000, bond interest rates were still at 6% (average for last 50 years) which means low yields weren't what was juicing the market. We are not in a similar situation as back then. Currently, bond yields are at all time lows and investors have no choice but to put money into stocks if they want a decent return. As low as rates remain at all time lows, the stock market isn't about to crash. \n\n**2nd point:** More stimulus checks are on the way. While there are many Americans that need this stimulus for everyday expenses, there are also millions of financially stable people who will be getting the stimulus even though that don't need it. Where do you think all this money will be going? If I had to bet it's mostly going into the stock market. \n\n**Summary** \\- Quit listening to fear mongers talking like the market is about the crash. Even if it corrects 10%-20% we will be fine. The data backs this up. The best time to invest for the long term is and always will be right now. Get in the market and dollar-cost average is it starts to fall (which I don't see a major fall happening until bond rates increase significantly). \n\n [Current Market Valuation - Buffett Indicator](http://www.currentmarketvaluation.com/models/buffett-indicator.php)", "id": "ltbdu8", "created_utc": 1614383971.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "10-20 % haircut is like Election Day prices , sure higher bond rates affect priced to perfection growth stocks but everyone who is not piling up into SaaS companies or has a cult like following for Ark funds is not loosing sleep at night.\n\nThe inflation fears making me laugh\n\n5Y break even at 2.34\n\n10Y at 2.15\n\npeople post here like we about to turn into Zimbabwe or Weimar.\n\nSimple checklist :\n\n1. if you a stock picker, maybe rethink you picks if a small pullback to prices from 3 weeks ago making you nervous\n2. if you truly don't know what you doing read about proper asset allocation and why global devirsification  is a good idea ( look at 2000-2010 sp500 performance and  international indexes if you have no idea about market cycles)\n3. if you doing any sector/strategy tilts make sure you ok with your thesis and ask yourself what if my strategy underperforms for 1year+ or even longer, can I stick to it?

That's why the Fed panic last March and in September 2019.\n\nAsset bubbles always pop.  The current asset bubble is driven by debt and when there is any rate change affecting debt for those asset purchases the bubble pops.  Now they can try to reflate the bubble by trying to drive down interest rates which they realistically can't go lower than they already are.  Negative interest rates are bad due to how the financial system works for banks.\n\nThe reason it will pop is due to the bond and real estate market.  When companies try to roll over the debt their cost of borrowing has gone up.  The people who own the bonds right now lose money since the price of the bond goes lower as the interest rate goes higher.  This is a huge deal because the bond market is larger than the stock market.  For the last 40 years, people have been told the bond market is safe and should move to bonds when they retire.  So now every pension fund in the US which isn't underfunded is now definitely underfunded.  Lots of universities will lose tons of money in endowments.  People's 401ks will drop significantly in value.  Any company parking money in these types of financial products just lost a ton of money too.\n\nIf they can't reinflate the debt bubble the stock market drops 50 to 80% and the neoliberal era is over (financial capitalism before that was the Keynesian era).

Kicking the can down the road just makes the pop much worse than if they would have handled it correctly in 2008.\n\nKey things to understand is when loans default this is currency destruction.  Banks create far more money than country central banks do.  Most of the money loaned today is used to purchase non-GDP producing assets.  The data doesn't back this up at all. In an economy, you want stable interest rates with a stable private debt load.  We have ever falling interest rates driven down by the ever-expanding private debt load.\n\nThe last thing to understand is investors and institutions are buying the bonds otherwise they wouldn't be that low.

SP500 Index was around 1200-1400 in the year of 1999, and 10 years later it sits at 900-1000.

{"title": "Meredith Corporation (MDP)", "selftext": "Hi WSB, this is my first post here. Not going to lie, I only found this site after the hype on GME, AMC and others.    \n\nPersonally I'm not much for hype in general but I do like investing and here is one of my picks from this summer: Meredith Corporation (MDP)  \n\nMDP is a media company and holds several well known magazine brands such as People and Allrecipes along with over 40 brands, Im not going to list them all here but you can check them here [https://www.meredith.com/](https://www.meredith.com/?fbclid=IwAR3mhyw-2QJUV0LOMKdEgVKj5pTZCNv_3rc0I1QYw3uJ1HdFgz31fTf2pK4)  \n\nSo whats the thing with MDP? It is a beaten down COVID-19 casualty stock that has made some serious progress over the last 6 months and confirmation came just last earnings. Lets go over some key figures to understand the valuation:    \n\nShares outstanding: 45,634,510 and these shares are in common and B class stocks as following:  Common shares: 40,565,853  B-Class shares: 5,068,657  \n\nShare price as of pre-market Feb 26th 2021: 25,34$ (Market cap of 1,2B)    \n\nBook Value per share: 13,375$ or P/B of 1,79 (609m$ shareholder equity)  \n\nCash per share: 8,3$  \n\nLong term Debt: 2,985B$    \n\nMDP just released its Q2-21 results (Normal company would be Q4-20) so I will be using the last 6 months as key information and try to break down the results into a normalized form as the results have been elevated quite a bit due to election cycle the data source that I use is the company 10Q available here [https://ir.meredith.com/financial-information/?section=QuarterlyResults](https://ir.meredith.com/financial-information/?section=QuarterlyResults&fbclid=IwAR2z0R_x_xQxLf8pDsNFGXraOTvkkmRAhJ3JFYOzZIiPd3yMpSfVdAfb-yc) :    \n\nRevenue: 1,595B up \\~4%  \n\nOperating Expenses: 1,268B down \\~6,6%  \n\nEPS: 3,93 (6months)  \n\nCFFO: 261,8m$ up \\~363% \n\n FCF: 249,8m$ and up quite a bit since it was bleeding cash in 2019 \n\nSo whats the catch here? Surely this is very cheap valuation however it gets interesting when we look at the earnings presentation slide 7 to be more precise: Political Advertisement H1-21 was 184m$ this with a 49% adjusted EBITDA margin translates into 90,4m$ So in order for us to have a better understanding of the 6 month figures here we must subtract this 90,4m$ from EBITDA of 344,5m$ and we get 254,1m$ of which DA expenses are 98,8m$ so we get 155,3m$ of which 20% would go to taxes and we get to 124,2m$ net earnings.  So if we do not assume any value for the political advertisement we arrive at P/E of around 10 (For 6 months earnings, and I do wish to emphasize this that we are NOT talking about 12month earnings). \n\nBut surely people here understand that every 2 years there is a new election cycle so at least 50% of the election cycle EBITDA can be taken into account as we try to predict the future earnings power of MDP. If we do that we arrive at net earnings of 160,4m$ (Thats net earnings and EPS of 3,52$) and the P/E drops to 6,84 (Again we are talking about 6 months here...)  \n\nNow based on my calculation I can absolutely say that this is very inexpensive (In my opinion) company especially when we take into consideration that legacy print media while shrinking, has already been surpassed by the digital media side as can be seen in the company earnings presentation slide 6.  \n\nNow going forward into Q3-21 or Q1 for us normal people. I do not know anything except what the company stated in their latest CC and the CFO made a comment that did catch my ear and it was around 15-20minute mark of the CC. The comment went something like this \"As of the end of January we had over 450m$ in the bank\" and I do wish that you listen the call yourself if and when you are making your investment decision however to my ear that sounded like the CFO just mentioned that they generated over 71m$ in just 1 month (per share that cash generation would translate into 1,55$) now for a company thats share price is around 25$ that is a lot.   \n\nSo here is my take on the company what do you guys think?", "id": "lsuxmw", "created_utc": 1614335293.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "We can\u2019t read friend \ud83d\ude42", "score": 31, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0762123316526413}, {"body": "Interesting.

{"title": "On GME and index re-balancing. DD from behind a Wendy's.", "selftext": "Alright, I know most of you can't read anything longer than a fortune cookie, so I'm putting this right up here at the top:\n\nTL;DR -   \n1. GME market cap goes up  \n2. Index funds end up underweight GME  \n3. They must fix this before May/June, or losses are locked in  \n4. Tendies   \n\n\nSo I was sucking on the Frosty machine at Wendy's when I decided to look into what it might mean for GME when it moves from the Russell 2000 (small cap) to the Russell 1000 (large cap) in May and June.  This typically doesn't mean much for a single stock, but with the volatility we've seen with GME already, as well as the percentage change in market cap, I think this may be more significant for GME than most companies.\n\nFTSE Russell does a big giant rebanlacing that lasts about two months in May and June.  Link here for the 2020 schedule. [https://www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule](https://www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule) .  The 2021 dates aren't released yet but should be basically the same.  Because of the recent run-up in price on GME, it is set for a move from the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000.  This same price increase also left many active fund managers underweight in GME, and they are losing out on recent gains.\n\nAll of this means Russell 2000 active fund managers who are underweight in GME right now, only have about 2-3 months to attempt to fix it before it gets taken out of the index, and their under performance on GME gets locked in.  It's quite possible that they are helping to form a large part of the floor, and their increasingly desperate attempts to not have the underweight GME locked in at re-balancing time will cause more and more volatility as the deadline approaches.\n\n A recent comparison I would like to make is to TSLA, both because of its retail popularity, short interest, and volatility leading up to SP500 inclusion.  S&P announced that TSLA would be added to the index on Nov. 17, 2020, and it was officially added on Dec. 21. In that time, it's stock price went from $441 to $649, with an overall increase in market cap of over $200 billion dollars.
