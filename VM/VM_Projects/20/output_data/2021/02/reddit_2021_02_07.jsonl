{"title": "Targeting a bubble stock (PLUG)", "selftext": "Greetings! I think we are in a massive retail driven bubble in EVs and Alternative Energy fueled by margin and options that will explode... I believe the crash will wipe out retail investors. Stocks like TSLA, PLUG, NIO, FCEL are the big offenders.\n\nHowever, I also realize the crash may not happen for another year or more. And I don't want to lose all my money on puts waiting while the market goes up. I was looking at ways to mitigate risk/possibly profit while waiting for a black swan event. I have an idea. Why not sell ATM covered calls and use the cash to buy multiple contracts of far OTM puts.\n\nLet's look at plug.\n\nPlug currently sits at $65.91. 65.5c 3/05 are 7.48. 35p 3/05 are 0.22.\n\nSo let's say I buy shares and sell 65c and buy 5x 35p. Total cost to me is 59.53 a share. So unless the stock goes below 59.53 I don't lose money. And if it does, I just repeat next month. \n\nIf it gets called away, I make about 9% in one month.\n\nIf there is a black swan, i make $4 for every dollar it goes below 35.\n\nNow, I'm not saying this is a good strategy because even if I'm right, I can miss. But, my loses are capped at $25 a share. \n\nThe math works on longer timelines as well. If I target 06/18 (sell 1 65c, buy 5x 35p) the cost becomes 60.28 per share. The downside here is I can't sell calls every month and my upside in shares being called away is less. \n\nI was wondering if there were more developed strategies similar to that.", "id": "leejsg", "created_utc": 1612669398.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah...

{"title": "A Deep Value Prospect that always beats earnings. Earnings are coming up and stock has started moving.", "selftext": "I was looking for great medium size companies with low risk to invest in. I saw the DD on Funko here and decided to dig deep. I noticed a lot of funds starting to buy Funko so I decided to look more into it. Fifth Street Station, BlackRock, Fundamental Capital Partners, Woodson Capital, ...\n\n**Here is the Summary of what I found:**\n\n* **Funko (FNKO)** represents an excellent deep value prospect for long-term investors.\n* Market Cap is \\~700 million which is selling for less than 1/2 of the price it was before pandemic. the price was suppressed due to a whale selling shares and that whale is done selling out.\n* FNKO has an excellent operating history but was slammed by the current downturn.\n* Leverage is not unreasonable and once the FNKO turns around, FNKO will offer strong upside prospects.\n* New fad of collecting Pops!\n* Shares rallied \\~25% in the aftermath of reporting third-quarter results.\n* This is due to a broad earnings beat in Q3 alongside a general recovery in the markets for names tethered to economic recovery.\n* It's impact from the pandemic bottomed out in Q2, and though revenue is expected to be negative through Q4, Wall Street expects a return to growth next year.\n* FNKO trades at only \\~15x next year's EPS estimates and \\~8x the earnings FNKO generated in FY19.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52kvqswpd4g61.png?width=335&format=png&auto=webp&s=895e594fd7cc35961f529d8d5b7f5846fd9064fc\n\nThis is the price action in the past year\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ndhkyfsqd4g61.png?width=437&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cc474906b63dfbac9079aeef74d716d7ebd1b8b\n\nPrice action in past 3.5 years\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q6jkubkrd4g61.png?width=432&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d71bf8146f5d46181ab8552d8598335df74881a\n\nThis FNKO is an iconic modern-day toy company. Despite its status as a fast-growing, quality firm at the height (so far) of its popularity, FNKO has been slammed by fears related to retail shutdowns. FNKO has benefited from increased demand from stay at home orders. FNKO pops like Pok\u00e9mon cards, coins, stamps, and precious metals have all benefited from hording behavior. FNKO pops are no exceptions to that. Investors have panicked about deserted malls and sent shares of the firm spiraling down in recent months. Near-term pain is over and the FNKO\u2019s prospects improving, now might be a good time to jump in and consider buying up a piece of the enterprise on the cheap.\n\n**Trends:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7wem6nsd4g61.png?width=1029&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c0aecc52349494f2e420fac631e0af43fb94278\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3vo04satd4g61.png?width=1033&format=png&auto=webp&s=e331da563e39ac1db8e1cb7ed260514263d21063\n\n**A great operating history**\n\nOperating history of this FNKO has been, over time, really impressive. Take, for instance, the case of revenue. Between 2017 and 2019, sales at the firm grew 54.1% from $516.08 million to $795.12 million. As sales at FNKO grew, FNKO\u2019s profits improved as well. Back in 2017, FNKO\u2019s net income totaled just $3.94 million. By 2019, net profit had grown to $11.73 million. Before we move on to other metrics, the firm\u2019s net profit does warrant some discussion. Despite the FNKO\u2019s strong brand name, FNKO has been unable to capitalize on it in the way that can generate attractive margin. Even in 2019, its best year on record, FNKO\u2019s net profit margin was 1.5%. It\u2019s a positive that this trend has been improving, but until margins grow substantially from here, FNKO is at risk of a bad year really hurting it.\n\nWhile bottom line wasn't great during shut downs, its other operating metrics are attractive. Operating cash flow, for instance, totaled $90.77 million. This was more than triple the $23.84 million in operating cash flow seen two years earlier. Even FNKO to 2018, this metric is up 81.6%. This works out to an operating cash flow margin for 2019 of 11.4%. Another important metric, Adjusted EBITDA, has also done well. Back in 2017, this metric totaled $90.03 million. This grew 36.7% to $123.04 million by 2019. This margin works out to 15.5% for 2019.\n\n**It might be time to jump on board**\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that FNKO is being hit at the moment, but it\u2019s important to keep the eye on the long-term outlook. Though management has provided no long-term guidance for the business, its operating history prior to the pandemic suggests that its future will continue to be bright once the crisis is past.\n\nIf we use metrics from 2019, its price/earnings ratio of 17 looks quite high. FNKO price/operating cash flow multiple, though, is far lower at 2.20. Its EV/EBITDA multiple on that basis is also low at 2.94. This makes the FNKO a clear deep-value prospect. Even if we annualize the firm\u2019s first quarter EBITDA, its forward EV/EBITDA multiple is still quite reasonable at 7.60, which means that **FNKO is cheap** now if we assumed that the future of the business would look a lot more like this year is likely to look.\n\n**Takeaway**\n\nBased on the data provided, it\u2019s clear to me that FNKO presents investors with some very attractive prospects at the moment. FNKO has a nice operating history. Its cash flows are particularly attractive. Right now, the business is being hurt by the global pandemic just like most firms across most industries, but once this pain passes, the upside from here could be quite significant. **FNKO is a great reopening investment and also great play on collectable fad that staying at home has ushered.**\n\nPositions: FNKO March and Feb $15 Calls; disclaimer I'm not a financial advisor.", "id": "levgjz", "created_utc": 1612731714.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "I keep seeing more and more FNKO posts.

Why? \n\n1) Income generated per vehicle could grow dramatically in the future as you can squeeze residual revenue streams from each car you sell. As Tesla has started to prove, people will pay for autonomy, over the air performance upgrades, media/internet connections, insurance offerings.\n\n2) Autonomy and battery tech is becoming a moat in the auto industry. Brands like Jeep and Ford may not go away, but the few  companies who have battery and autonomy advantage will become the manufacturer and operating system for all brands. I believe GM is one of the companies that will emerge as a leader \n\n3) Just as analysts failed to find the right PT for Tesla and doubted its survival back in 2019, GM hasn\u2019t changed the narrative *yet*. I could be wrong but even at close to all time highs, I think this stock has A LOT of room to run. If Tesla traded at 25x sales, let\u2019s say GM should be 1-2x (vs .5 today) due to potential margin expansion \n\n4) I like Tesla, but look around. Everyone drives a different style car and not everyone is going to want a CyberTruck. GM doesn\u2019t need to be a Tesla killer, just competitive enough to retain share of truck and fleet sales.\n\nI\u2019m long GM. This isn\u2019t financial advice, I just like the stock so do your own research.\n\n\nEdit: To the question of whether the news is priced in, I think the negative comments on this post suggest GM\u2019s future in EVs, battery tech and autonomy is NOT priced in (if the forward PE ratio relative to 2021 EPS wasn\u2019t already enough evidence). The question in my mind is whether GM/Cruise will be able to execute, but the fact they already have driverless taxis in SF and top-selling EV in China seems to me like they\u2019re headed in the right direction.", "id": "lek3jh", "created_utc": 1612693960.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "This.

{"title": "Why I'm not leaving Robinhood. And why I hate/love Robinhood.", "selftext": "I was pretty pissed off when RH blocked buying of the meme stocks.  $GME, $BB, $NOK.  But for a different reason than most.\n\n$GME:\n\nI caught the train late.  4 shares.  Bought and sold in the same hour.  Made about $400.  (I'm shocked that people bought at $360.  I've bought some stocks at the top of the rollercoaster before.  But DAMN son, never have I bought a stock that was obviously nuts).\n\n$BB:\n\nBought some, after seeing the noobs jumping all in.  I set up a stop-loss and my stock sold at a small loss.  If RH wouldn't have froze the stock my stop-loss wouldn't have triggered and I'd have $400 in profit.\n\n$NOK:\n\nInvested (repeat, INVESTED) in $NOK back in October when news broke about the deal with NASA.  Not selling this one for some time.  I have no idea why $NOK was even considered to be the same shit as $GME.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was pissed at RH because my stop-loss triggered.  But only slightly.  I was really pissed off because I started the day off intending on buying a PUT $GME.  Cause the bubble was going to burst.  I don't think RH froze trading because of some conspiracy BS.  And I don't really care (because the game is rigged, always has been).  RH probably stopped the trading due to not having the assets to cover the trading.  Not to mention their servers fuck up all the time (they can't handle trade volume at a stupid level).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm switching my main broker over to WeBull.  (I opened up an account with the 4 month ago, just never used it).  The tools they offer and the trading hours are far better.  Downside, they don't offer trading for OTC stocks.\n\nI'm staying with RH (why I love RH)\n\n* so I can gamble on shitty OTC stocks like $RYCE.\n* They offer instant deposit and settlement free.\n* The interface is good looking.\n* They are an American made company.\n* I can gamble on fake money.\n\nWhy I hate RH:\n\n* The platform always crashes (trade volume too high)\n* The app always resets my login time restriction with each update (I hate having to login after a 5min wait)\n\nPSA for the 7 million new subs:\n\n* If you're triggered by words like Retard, you should probably leave.\n* If you don't know much about options, stay the fuck away from them.  (I dabble.  If you want to actually invest stick to stocks that pay dividends and have a good history/future.  If you want to gamble try pennystocks.  They are fun.)\n* If you have to ask:  Did I miss the train?  You have...\n* $GME is not going to rocket again.  Take the loss.\n* Don't buy the hype.  Exploit the hype.\n\n$GME is not going to rocket again.  We got one up on the big dogs.  I always wondered if it would be possible to hype a stock so much that it would get to the level of $GME.  But, learned that directing the hive mind is like trying to heard cats.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe big dogs have already changed their strategy.  They will recover.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again.  One day r/wallstreetbets will be banned at the federal level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOther thoughts on RH stopping trading:\n\n* They stopped the use of margin for buying $GME and etc.  Which is something that actually did protect the end users. \n* If the buying frenzy continued their shitty servers would have gone up in flames.  Happens every time a stock goes crazy.\n* This was not a freeze on trading for a moral reason.
