{"title": "DD: If you're not in Cloudflare, strongly consider changing that. Earnings are great, the company is great, the mission is great. To find out why, read below", "selftext": "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19bl8i-Pm5w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19bl8i-Pm5w)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlright guys. This is going to be long, but if you want actual DD, sit back and enjoy. NET is doing excellent, and will only continue to excel as it continues to grab market share and boom in the background.\n\n**---**\n\n**What is Cloudflare?**\n\nCloudflare is going to make a leading player in next-generation computing. From their blog: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/). Excerpt:\n\n>\u201cImagine you\u2019re the maintainer of a high-traffic media website, and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare.  \nPage speed is critical. You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism...\u00a0\u00a0you\u2019re going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner...Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter\u201d\n\nSeriously, this is cool, and it\u2019s only beginning. Cloudflare is innovating every day. Their customers absolutely love them. As a software engineer, they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. I think what\u2019s going to help them into a powerhouse is this:\n\n>Over the coming months, we\u2019ll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience. It\u2019ll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we\u2019ll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won\u2019t just be your frontend, it\u2019ll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.\n\nSoon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare\u2019s network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they\u2019ll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.\n\nIf you\u2019re not a developer, you probably didn\u2019t understand most of that, but essentially, they\u2019re making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money.\n\nI can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it\u2019s profitability... \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n(And even if it doesn\u2019t, and stays at 50%, it will still \ud83d\ude80 but slower. Regardless, it\u2019s going up)\n\n\\---\n\n\u201cBuT iT tAnKeD oN EaRnInGs\u201d\n\nThat drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren\u2019t long. Plus it\u2019s hardly a tank when it\u2019s at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher\n\nIts earnings was good, and to those who haven\u2019t read it, [do so](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/) besides relying on a stock\u2019s immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:\n\n>Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings\n\nRevenue right now is $125 million. Doesn\u2019t sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that\u2019s $1 billion a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion\n\nYes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That\u2019s why I\u2019m long Jan 21 115c.\n\nThe revenue and growth isn\u2019t the impressive part. The margins are\n\n>GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\nHigh 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it's consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they\u2019re going to be **raking** in dough\n\nThat being said, NET isn\u2019t profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they\u2019ve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn\u2019t stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there\u2019s nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here\u2019s why:\n\n\\- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early \u201822\n\n\\- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare\u2019s network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that.\n\n\\- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors.\n\n\u2014-\n\n**CONS**\n\nThe only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I\u2019m a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there\u2019s no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don\u2019t matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare\u2019s \u201cBuild a Better Internet\u201d shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare\u2019s already enormous Cloudflare network.\n\nThis stock already got [multiple](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren\u2019t in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I\u2019m trying to be conservative here).\n\nSeriously, give this a second look. I\u2019ve been playing NET since 37. It\u2019s a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn\u2019t done its 30% move.

It reached that level briefly early in the week but returned to it in the final hour of trading Friday.\n*****\n> Yields are rising on optimism for an improving economy, but also as inflation expectations also move higher.\n*****\n> \u201cIf you think about the big drivers, they\u2019re related - vaccines, stimulus and inflation,\u201d said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. \u201cIf there\u2019s more talk out of D.C. about moving the stimulus package forward, that sets the stage for yields to go up.\u201d\n*****\n> The market is concerned about the economy running hotter, since it could be a trigger to change Fed policy.\n*****\n> At the same time, the Fed has said it would tolerate inflation above its 2% target.\n*****\n> Krosby of Prudential Financial said the market will also pay attention to the producer price index Wednesday even though it is not typically a big factor.\n*****\n> \u201cBecause there\u2019s such a debate on inflationary trends, I know the CPI [consumer price index] came in comfortable, but the producer price index is coming in and we\u2019ll see if that has eased,\u201d she said.\n*****\n> \u201cObviously supply chains are being reestablished and inventories are building,\u201d said Krosby.\n*****\n> Consumer inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.4% in January.\n*****\n> # Housing statistics\nHousing data is also dominant on the calendar in the holiday-shortened week.\n*****\n> The National Association of Home Builders releases its housing market index data on Wednesday, a measurement of sentiment around market conditions for new home sales.\n*****\n> On Thursday, the government will issue data on pending home sales and building permits. Finally, the National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales data on Friday.\n*****\n> Upcoming hearing on GameStop and short squeezes\nStocks were higher in the past week, with energy, tech and financials as the best performers. The S&P 500 rose 1.2%, ending the week at 3,934.\n*****\n> There were some market hot spots, like cannabis shares which became the latest target of the Reddit trading community. The stocks shot higher Wednesday, adding to already lofty gains in recent weeks before giving up some of those gains.\n*****\n> Investors will also be focused on the Thursday hearing before the House Financial Services Committee on the wild trading recently in GameStop and other heavily-shorted names.\n*****\n> Robinhood\u2019s CEO is expected to testify, as are executives from Melvin Capital Management and Citadel.\n*****\n> The frenzied activity in some small and shorted stocks has raised concerns about the market becoming overheated. But Ari Wald, head of technical analysis at Oppenheimer, said the broader market\u2019s advance is intact.\n*****\n> \u201cOverall, it\u2019s a bull market. I think the steadiness of the advance is underappreciated,\u201d Wald said. He said the market technicals are healthy. Breadth is broad-based and there\u2019s cyclical leadership.\n*****\n> \u201cThe low-volatility, high-dividend paying sectors are at risk,\u201d said Wald. Utilities and consumer staples stocks, which both fit that category, were lower on the week.\n*****\n> The market was also awaiting the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, and it is not expected to react.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/L9zmpOB.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cZgpsNC.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/BvmjknF.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/wWv2RIG.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/AfQYO3V.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GNiq0fE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/v4lTpw4.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/83YL2qB.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/0AZF7RF.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/MUQx3xY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/60KQa22.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LBj1NDa.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Presidents' Day Seasonality\n\n> The US equity market will be closed on Monday in observance of the Presidents' Day holiday. Since 1971 when the Uniform Monday Holiday Act set the third Monday in February, rather than on George Washington's birthday (February 22nd) as the Federal holiday, equity market performance during the week of Presidents' Day has been pretty mixed. From the Friday before President's Day through the Friday after, the S&P 500 has traded higher half the time for an average decline of 5 bps. Taking a closer look, in the chart below we show the median returns by day for each trading day in Presidents' week. Tuesday and Thursday have both averaged declines of 13 bps and 7 bps, respectively. Wednesday averages flat performance but the S&P 500 has only been higher 40% of the time. Despite weakness throughout most of the week, equities have tended to catch a bid by week's end with an average 6 bps gain on Friday with a move higher 58% of the time.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day3f.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show the average intraday performance of the S&P 500 during Presidents' Day week since 1983 when our intraday data begins. We also include looks for years when the S&P 500 was up and down YTD headed into the holiday. Again, the general pattern has been a steady drift lower until Friday when the S&P 500 has tended to rebound. We would note that the Friday rebound is not an all-day event. As shown, performance is pretty flat in the first several hours of trading with the biggest ramp higher occurring in the final of hours of tradings. That pattern is also consistent for both up and down years, though, in years that the S&P 500 was down YTD headed into the holiday there was a bit of a rebound midweek which was reversed by the end of the week.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021221-Presidents-Day.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Trading After Presidents\u2019 Day Weekend Continues to be Weak\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/902779bf6e4c3920c0a6e594303d1963/f9c2be89a4714ce6-96/s500x750/313ae18652b5c66a140a47602ee5649c59baeee7.jpg))**\n\n> In a recent post we looked at the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents\u2019 Day weekend. However, the two days after still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents\u2019 Day has been strongest for the S&P 500 with 18 gains and 13 losses for median gain of 0.12% but with an average loss of \u20130.23%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 18 of 31 years with and average loss of \u20130.49% and a median loss of \u20130.11%.\n\n> Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents\u2019 Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 31 with an average loss of \u20130.07% and a median decline of \u20130.10%. S&P 500 is down 18 of 31, average \u20130.02%, median \u20130.10% and NASDAQ is down 17 of 31, average \u20130.01%, median \u20130.09%.\n\n*****\n\n> # Why Bulls Will Like The Year Of The Ox\n\n> \u201cBulls make money, bears make money, and pigs get slaughtered.\u201d Old Wall Street saying.\n\n> The Chinese New Year (often called the Lunar New Year) will kick off Friday, February 12, and with it will begin the Year of the Ox. Although we would never suggest investing based on the zodiac signs\u2014it is important to note that the Year of the Ox has historically been quite strong for equities. Not to mention we are saying goodbye to the year of the Rat. Good riddance to the Rat, as the last two years of the Rat were 2008 and 2020, not the best years for many reasons!\n\n> Since the Chinese New Year typically starts between late-January and mid-February, we looked at the 12-month return of the S&P 500 Index starting at the end of January dating back to 1950. And wouldn\u2019t you know it? The Year of the Ox has been up more than 13% on average (with a median advance of nearly 18%); suggesting bulls are smiling indeed!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> \u201cThe year of the Ox is the second of the 12 animal signs of the Chinese zodiac, and the Ox is considered a symbol of diligence, persistence, and honesty. Equity returns indeed are quite persistent during the Ox, as it is the third best return out of the 12 Zodiac signs,\u201d explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> The LPL Chart of the Day shows how all the 12 Zodiac signs have done historically, with the Goat, Tiger, and Ox as the best, while the Rooster and Snake have been the worst.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2.10.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We want to stress that no one should invest purely based on the zodiac signs. This relationship is random and the sample size is small. Still, here\u2019s hoping that the Year of the Ox plays out well for the bulls once again!\n\n*****\n\n> # Short Interest Update\n\n> Yesterday, bi-weekly short interest data was released for the period ending January 30th. In the chart below, we show the Russell 3000 broken up into deciles based on short interest as a percent of the float at the end of 2020 and these decile's stock's median change in short interest from then to yesterday's release. As shown, with the short squeeze episode playing out in the second half of January, the stocks that came into 2020 the most heavily shorted have seen the biggest declines in short interest. That decile of what had been the most heavily shorted names has seen short interest as a percent of float fall for a median of 2.65 percentage points. Deciles two and three have similarly seen sizable declines, though, they are far smaller than those of the most shorted stocks. On the other hand, the decile of the least shorted stocks is the only one that has seen the median short interest reading move higher since the end of 2020.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Deciles-F.png))**\n\n> In the table below, we show the stocks that currently have the highest short interest as a percent of float. After the historic move higher, short squeeze poster child GameStop (GME) is no longer the Russell 3000's most heavily shorted name! Having dropped over 100 percentage points since the start of the year, only 42.61% of shares are now short compared to 43.57% for Gogo (GOGO); currently the most shorted stock in the index. GOGO has actually seen its shorts come off a bit this year as well but that decline has been far more modest of only a little more than one percentage point. Of the other stocks in the index, only Tanger Outlets (SKT) and Dillard's (DDS) also currently have more than 40% of the float sold short.\n\n> On the January 27th closing high, GME was up 1,744.53% year to date. But with the short squeeze unwinding, the stock has fallen over 86%. Others of this cohort have similarly seen big reversals of their earlier surges. For example, National Beverage (FIZZ) had doubled YTD at the time of the GME peak, but since then it has been cut by 33.78%. Not all of these have been losers since the pinnacle of short selling though. Fulgent Genetics, which now has over 30% of shares short, has risen 91.01%. Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) have similarly seen big gains of over 30%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Current-High.png))**\n\n> Given GME came into the year with an absurd number of shares sold short, the squeeze has resulted in it being the biggest decliner in terms of short interest of any Russell 3000 stock. Short interest as a percentage of float has fallen over 100 percentage points YTD. The next biggest drop came from BigCommerce Holdings (BIGC) and Dillard's (DDS) which both saw larger than 50 percentage point drops. Of the rest of the top twenty biggest decliners, a baker's dozen have seen short interest drop by at least 20 points. Additionally, of these stocks that have seen short interest fall the most, only three\u2014nCino (NCNO), Berkeley Lights (BLI), and 3D Systems (DDD)\u2014now have a single-digit short interest as a percent of float.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Decline.png))**\n\n> Given the massive short squeezes, there are far more stocks that now have a lower short interest as a percent of float than at the start of the year. In fact, of the Russell 3000 stocks, 1887 have seen declines in short interest compared to only 1146 that have seen an increase. In the table below, we show the twenty stocks to have seen the biggest increases in SIPF since the start of the year. As shown, there is only one, International Game Technology (IGT), that has seen short interest rise by double digits since the end of 2020.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Table-Increase.png))**\n\n> Retailers notably dominate the list of stocks with the biggest declines in short interest. To quantify this, in the chart below we show the aggregate number of shorted shares as a percent of total float for each industry group as of the most recent short interest data and the end of 2020. As shown, just as it was at the start of the year, retailers remain the most heavily shorted industry group, but it has greatly improved with only 5.86% short compared to 8.15% at the end of 2020. That is the only industry group to have seen short interest drop by a full percentage point or more. The industry group to have experienced the next largest decline was Transportation with aggregate short interest falling from 5.08% to 4.13%. Conversely, there are two industries, Banks and Materials, that have higher short interest as a percent of float than they did at the end of 2020.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/02/021020-SI-Agg-Industry.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 12th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX2qSnPh7aQ))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 2.14.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$PLTR** \n> * **$SHOP** \n> * **$CVS** \n> * **$WMT** \n> * **$ROKU** \n> * **$FSLY** \n> * **$FVRR** \n> * **$AAP** \n> * **$TLRY** \n> * **$TWLO** \n> * **$WIX** \n> * **$AMAT** \n> * **$GOLD** \n> * **$TTD** \n> * **$AN** \n> * **$DBX** \n> * **$BIDU** \n> * **$YNDX** \n> * **$WING** \n> * **$LPX** \n> * **$ZTS** \n> * **$TRU** \n> * **$SPWR** \n> * **$ECL** \n> * **$ADI** \n> * **$BIGC** \n> * **$SEDG** \n> * **$EXPD** \n> * **$WM** \n> * **$MRO** \n> * **$RNG** \n> * **$STMP** \n> * **$USFD** \n> * **$TRMN** \n> * **$ET** \n> * **$BKI** \n> * **$OXY** \n> * **$TRTN** \n> * **$VMC** \n> * **$TSEM** \n> * **$SNBR** \n> * **$HLT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/QgDa3h7.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE TUESDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/JRy8Aaj.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 2.15.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

{"title": "A lesson about inflation and how it applies to stocks & options trading strategies", "selftext": "Good Evening,\n\nI want to dive into the concept of inflation and how it affects all of our little(and large) subreddit communities. \n\nHave you been noticing the price of commodities rising recently? Inflation is creeping up on the economy. In November of 2020 the CPI report(Consumer Price Index)increased a whopping 1.2% over the past 12 months. What we saw were rises in electricity, utility gas, used cars & trucks etc. Inflation shrinks our dollars purchasing power which means we can buy less goods and publicly traded companies revenues & profits go down. As a result, the economy slows down until inflation stabilizes. Consider the idea that just because ticker XYZ beat earnings, it doesn't mean there was actually growth, hence maybe why the stock slid and didn't rise after earnings(because inflation caused an earnings beat, not growth).\n\nInflation can also cause you to overpay for stocks. Because we have a global market, inflation makes it incredibly difficult to compete in other economies that aren't suffering from inflation. In the end, investors get robbed by increasing prices with no corresponding increase in value. When we look at the market, when can see an abundance of undisciplined money which = excess supply = inflation. When you buy stock, you are paying more for less now. The old saying of \"fundamentals don't matter\" couldn't be more true, because they don't during inflation. Too much money chasing too few goods is the classic definition of inflation. Taking money out of the market therefore slows the cycle of price increases.\n\nIt is the aim of the fed to remove excess money supply from markets by increasing rates. Higher rates = higher borrowing costs = money removed. Notice the treasuries purchased through the pandemic? The fed obviously doesn't do this on good will for the sake of the citizens of the earth. Its an investment. Yields rise during a crash, people are taking money out, fed steps in to buy treasuries low and then sells them high when rates are at their lowest = treasuries at their highest. If you think the fed is going to allow the citizens of earth to sell (unwind)their treasuries before they get to, you'd be mistaken. So it goes, as yields rise, rates rise, stocks go down, money printer doesn't go brrrr anymore. We are already seeing treasury sell-offs.\n\nI don't think I need to go into detail about how or why this might affect you personally because quite frankly if you read this to the end I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt that you actually understand what I wrote and that its not personal opinion, but how finance works.\n\nSidenote - The whole \"short sellers are the devil\" conversation needs to stop. You're a real smooth brain if you think short selling is your enemy. Sure, I'll give some credence to the GME situation. Its pretty vile to short sell a company into oblivion basically, especially during a pandemic when it could potentially put peoples livelihoods at stake(talking about you GME employees and all the other people that rely on GME doing business with them to keep the doors open too). However, remember that short sellers are the ones buying the crash while everyone else is late to the table panic selling half way down and then cheering for it to crash further because they bought some OTM puts they don't want expiring worthless which is vile.

Remember, in periods of inflation any good can sell for more than it actually might be worth. When we have inflation, the dollar is worth less and it takes more dollars to buy the same thing(kind of like implied volatility rising on an option). Inflation on stocks is like extrinsic value. Extrinsic value isn't intrinsic. Stocks are a mean reverting product too, if they weren't the SPY would be at 100,000. We combat inflation by removing money supply.
