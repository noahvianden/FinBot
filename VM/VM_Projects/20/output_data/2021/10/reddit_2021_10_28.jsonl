{"title": "Discovery isn't Discovery. Discovery is a full play on Warner Media + HBO Max", "selftext": "The original analysis was done by PurpleFloyd, who just so happens to also be me: [https://purplefloyd.substack.com/p/discovery-is-an-underdog](https://purplefloyd.substack.com/p/discovery-is-an-underdog)\n\nI apologize to those autists who do not like to read. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j0ar24i6t6w71.png?width=1442&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a5adc9de6af713f6626defe5f3aa03c842ba839\n\n**John Malone,** who holds most of Discovery\u2019s voting rights is at it again. In January 1990 he had \u2018tight control\u2019 over the media industry. So in order to alleviate some pressure from Washington he decided to spin-off the telecom giants programming assets from its cable operations, and he made a quick fortune in doing so. The scene has changed and cable is no longer the king of content, but behind John Malone\u2019s leathery exterior sits a keen mind that is ever aware of the changing landscape- and how to profit from it.\n\n# Spin-offs\n\nFunnily enough, where there is proof that acquisitions destroy shareholder value there is also proof that spin-offs tend to [add value.](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/strategy/sp-us-spin-off-index/#overview) Spin-offs give the market the opportunity to appraise a single segment or division of a company, rather than looking at it boxed up with old antiques.\n\nBelow, the white graph shows the S&P U.S. Spin-Off index compared to the blue- S&P500.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e4cnmjhjt6w71.png?width=1009&format=png&auto=webp&s=06f1e7c18be02ebd9a1d21a1806c42fc2f15c265\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean we can blindly jump into a spin-off. We still need to do our homework.\n\nLooking into AT&T previously naturally led me to take a squiz at Discovery again. The spin-off merger (planned to happen next year, 2022) of WarnerMedia from AT&T into Discovery is a big deal. WarnerMedia has top content, HBO Max is set to compete on the global stage with Netflix, Disney+ Apple TV, and Amazon Prime and Discovery is a bridge for the expansion.\n\nI feel like I am slightly late to the game on this one, as most of the internet has already pored over this. But from what I have seen (or what I have missed) they didn\u2019t get the value quite right.\n\nI looked briefly at Discovery some years ago, the share price was depressed then too. A large amount of debt and cable assets didn\u2019t scream \u201cbuy\u201d to me. Their shares could also easily be diluted by preferred stock shareholders. Netflix was also gobbling up subscribers who were slowly cutting their cable.\n\nMaybe Discovery has passed its prime, maybe the days of watching Bear Grylls drink his own piss are gone\u2026or are they?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Discovery:\n\nDiscovery isn\u2019t an overly complicated business. They do television networks and make content. Their money comes from advertising and distribution.\n\nDiscovery\u2019s biggest moneymaker is their American television network segment. But they also have a great footprint internationally. The television network segment which contains Discovery Channel, Food Network, and others, has a significant amount of subscribers.\n\n**Discovery 2019:**\n\nCash provided by operations: **+3.4Bn**\n\nCash used in investing: **-438Mn**\n\nFree cash flow to the firm**: \\~3Bn**\n\n**Discovery 2020: Covid Year**\n\nCash provided by operations: **+2.7Bn**\n\nCash used in investing: **-703Mn**\n\nFree cash flow to the firm**: \\~2Bn**\n\n### Strong Cash Flow\n\nDiscovery has a strong cash flow. Most of the 3bn and 2bn generated in 2019 and 2020 respectively have been used to **buy back stock and pay down debt.** **Debt sits at \\~15Bn,** so they are not conservatively leveraged but Discovery easily covers this \\~**$650Mn** interest expense so it\u2019s not a dangerous amount of debt either.\n\nA nice way to scan a company before diving into the dirty details is to look at the cash flow generated and compare that to its market capitalization. This gives you a rough free cash flow yield. I like to take their cash flow and cut a good 10-30% off of it, so I arrive at a conservative estimate. Then if the cash flow yield is still above 10-15% I start looking deeper. I do this to maintain a margin of safety, it gives me room to make mistakes because I am not omniscient.\n\nLooking at Discovery itself, however, is not the way to value this business. The merger is going to change what Discovery shareholders are exposed to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uy8il35qt6w71.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=620d2db9334d8c65cf1570d52b702f8cfb6bbfc8\n\nIn 2022, Discovery shareholders are going to hold much less of Discovery\u2019s original business. They will be more exposed to Warner Media\u2019s growing business, compared to Discovery\u2019s lackluster television networks business. **This changes the game a bit.**\n\nIf we buy Discovery, we need to understand how much of the pie we\u2019re getting, and at what price\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### The Merger\n\nDiscovery current has a weighted average of **504Mn undiluted** and 6**64Mn fully diluted** shares outstanding. The dilution comes from convertible preference shares, namely Series A and Series C convertible preference shares. \u201cSeries A Preferred\u201d **originally** converts into 9 Series A Common. \u201cSeries C Preferred\u201d **originally** converts into 19 Series C common.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ro3tfftwt6w71.png?width=1105&format=png&auto=webp&s=b113e8228d809c1b061f5951c876fbebfc99a117\n\nWhat has changed due to the merger? Here in the Discovery/Warner Media merger agreement or \u201cThe Merger Agreement\u201d they provide us with a lovely ***riddle:***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jso90auyt6w71.png?width=1315&format=png&auto=webp&s=044f3ea2717d2e16d4726e04b674d5ac867ed262\n\n\u201cWTF are they saying?\u201d right?\n\nWe do not need to calculate how much dilution will take place, or what these shares will be converted into. **We already know what we need to know- that all the preferred stock is going to convert leading to a full dilution.** And the amount of fully diluted shares is given to us on the financial statements - **664Mn.**\n\n# Valuation\n\nI wouldn\u2019t buy Discovery if in one years time it was still going to be Discovery. They have quite a bit of debt, and even though the cash flow yield is ok, I think their business is going to face extreme competition from the streamers.\n\n**But,** the merger changes a lot of things:\n\n1. It allows Discovery to help give HBO/HBO Max the international footprint it needs to continue to grow and take on Netflix/Disney.\n2. It gives Discovery shareholders great exposure to a new hot asset, that can turn the 14.6% cash flow yield into a cash flow yield that grows over time which changes Discovery\u2019s valuation completely.\n3. It creates a new streaming media company with tons of hours of content/entertainment AND a way to get it directly to consumers. **It allows Discovery to move from earning money from distributors and allowing them to have a direct to consumer relationship with customers- huge.**\n\nTo value Discovery right now, you cannot look at Discovery alone. After the merge Discovery shareholders are going to be holding an entirely different beast. They will have exposure to Warner Bros content, Turner, HBO as well as exposure to the synergies.\n\nRecall that the new Combined company is going to receive \\~75% of it\u2019s revenue from Warner Media assets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/56n95n81u6w71.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=b80c611ba60df073ee14c19078a8e52fe2d490ab\n\nSo what do you get when you buy Discovery common stock now? Below I combined a few metrics from Warner Media and Discovery to create a **rough** view of the \u201cCombined\u201d company.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ycp96a43u6w71.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=cad37f877f1e34ea1ec76d663d74dfa16193be9f\n\nIf you buy Discovery common stock now, **then after the merger** you will be receiving \\~$3.17 cash flow per share (conservative estimate) **that is generated mostly by Warner Media**. Discovery is trading lower and lower, around **\\~$23 per share** or a **13.8%** cash flow yield or a **price to cash flow of 7.25** \\- **using the combined company\u2019s metrics (note:** not pre-merger Discovery metrics, these are based on post-merger financials).\n\nBut by buying Discovery now, you set yourself up to receive this exposure next year.\n\n### Netflix\n\nCompare this to Netflix which has a price to cash flow of **\\~127.** (can\u2019t make this up).\n\nThese are pricy multiples because Netflix is growing fast, and has amassed large market share. The thing is, people do not pay for Netflix, they pay for Netflix\u2019s content, and Warner Media + Discovery will have tons of content. A formidable opponent to Netflix. HBO is already well known globally for Game of Thrones, Succession, and others.\n\n**Discovery & Warner merger: Price to cash flow: 7.25**\n\n**Netflix: Price to cash flow: 127**\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t compare Netflix to Warner Media/Discovery\u201d - what better asset is there? Look at HBO Max\u2019s platform compared to Netflix\u2019s below: The similarities are striking, the only difference is the management of the content. Discovery generates income from advertising and distributors whereas Netflix has a direct-to-consumer relationship.\n\nDiscovery will provide the bridge to HBO to go global, and HBO can allow Discovery\u2019s content to get closer to a direct-to-consumer model.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/olthnl96u6w71.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=11714ea3dc1afc22c2c755870002943ea05e4d49\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/epysq4d7u6w71.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1ab3caf8c6222f39ab71f92050bedcbba6d2a5a\n\nThe Discovery and Warner Media merger seems like a great \u201cplug and play\u201d way to increase value by moving Discovery\u2019s content away from cable and to an OTT (over the top) service.\n\n# Catalyst\n\nNormally I don\u2019t care for a catalyst. I just care for value, but the catalyst here will be the spin-off merger combined with HBO Max going global.\n\n**Warning:** In a spin-off stocks sometimes tank hard and fast because shareholders from parent companies sell the stock indiscriminately. Some tracker ETF\u2019s may also sell spin-offs because it doesn\u2019t meet the requirements for what they can hold. All of this can add undue pressure in a sell-off. However, in this chaotic environment, it can also offer someone who is prepared to buy at lovely prices.\n\n***Disclaimer:***\n\nThis is purely educational material and it should not be taken as financial advice.", "id": "qhmdu8", "created_utc": 1635425657.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Oh yes, my position: I'm only holding $10k at $23/24 worth of stock now, looking to add lower.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I'm guessing you probably bought sometime around March 2021 and those bags are getting heavy as hell.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I bought like a few days ago", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.36988765001296997}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23668208718299866}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2522350251674652}, {"body": "You forgot to mention that Discovery sell it rights to set of their channels.

I think the upside ($27+) is greater than the downside. Root still has $1b of cash on hand equivalent to around $4 per share. Root is working on cost reduction and improving the loss ratio.

{"title": "The Impending Chinese Economic Crisis - Live Discussion Follow Up, Bonus on Treasury implications", "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nMy  Social Credit Rating with the CCP just took a -10,000,000,000 hit for  the title, but there are real issues in China, both long term and short  term that are really going to fuck China, and  to a lesser extent the  rest of the world.\n\nLet's start  with the big, long term problems: China has a population that is in  decline. You don't have to take my word for it, this is the CIA World  Factbook's population pyramid: [https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/china/images/e74e15f4-8dab-595d-9f53-1ce0c389053a](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/china/images/e74e15f4-8dab-595d-9f53-1ce0c389053a).  This is a description of the population as it currently is. The  population is slowly shrinking over time, which is good for the planet,  but bad for the Chinese economy due to labor shortage issues.  Additionally, they have some old and new cultural issues that are  screwing that big working age population. Everyone knows about the  1-child policy. Well, that's been revoked, but Chinese families still  aren't having more than 1 kid, because they see how hard it is to raise 1  kid. In some families there are 4 elderly grandparents and 2 newly  retired parents being supported by 1 working-age person. This is called  the 4 2 1 problem, and the CCP is quietly panicking about it. In fact,  in 2029 the Chinese population is expected to peak at 1.44B people  before entering an \"unstoppable decline.\" (source: [https://time.com/5523805/china-aging-population-working-age/](https://time.com/5523805/china-aging-population-working-age/))  In the long run, these problems lead even the casual China observer to  see that the workforce in China will soon be overtaxed and while they  might still be a manufacturing powerhouse, that power is soon to be  going downhill.\n\nThe medium term  problem is a first order derivative problem of the first. The Chinese  government and companies in China built up massive amounts of  infrastructure and housing to support their large population. This  caused shitty housing and jobs problems to occur. Every time there's an  unforeseen disaster there are thousands to tens of thousands of dead and  millions of dollars of destruction of property. So yeah, Chinese  infrastructure is gigantic, but it sucks, and soon it won't even be used  because the population won't be there to maintain it. Soon we'll all  get to see what happens when massive human developments are reclaimed by  nature. There was a big push to do the Belt and Road [https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative),  a modern Silk Road that would go overland to Europe. This would take up  a huge amount of concrete, asphalt, cement, aggregates, and steel. The  problem is that overland shipping is expensive for long distances  compared to sea shipping, and the maintenance costs would be  prohibitive. This is essentially an infrastructure sink for a country  that has massive infrastructure production capacity, but nowhere to put  it.\n\nThis  brings us to the short-term problem, which is a second order derivative  of the first problem: Chinese REITs are missing bond payments,  defaulting, and soon will go bankrupt. Evergrande is the only the  biggest and highest profile, and they probably represent a systemic risk  to a \"generational event.\" Evergrande is responsible for having at  least one ghost city erected and demolished. The near term for property  development in China is at best weak.\n\nI  fully expect the Chinese economy to crash, and crash hard. They may  never recover. They're desperate to take Taiwan or anywhere else that is  \"culturally Chinese\" or \"historically Chinese\" because they need  external and younger labor to fuel their needed growth economically in  the next 50 years. This whole thing is going to be a gigantic  clusterfuck.\n\nThis brings us to the  US national debt. It is factually incorrect to say that China is the  largest holder of US debt. China isn't even the largest foreign holder  of US debt. That honor goes to Japan, which is also experiencing a  demographic problem ([https://www.thebalance.com/who-owns-the-u-s-national-debt-3306124](https://www.thebalance.com/who-owns-the-u-s-national-debt-3306124)). About half of all US debt is in retirement accounts, a large portion of which is held by the Social Security Administration. **If the US ever defaults on the debt, the people it will fuck the hardest are old**. That's not just a US problem, **that's a developed nations problem**, because in under-developed countries people tend to not live as long.\n\nThe lesson here is: **follow the debt ceiling fuckery**.  If the US ever defaults on the debt, puts on the developed world. Your  best bets will be c\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*s and precious metals. If the US kills the debt  ceiling permanently, calls on big US firms. If the US keeps stringing  along with temporary increases or eliminations of the debt ceiling,  well... more of the same.", "id": "qhtd4b", "created_utc": 1635445794.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "I'm freaking ban bet the Yang to be $17 by COB tomorrow.

{"title": "Roblox about to make you serious ROBUX!", "selftext": "First, I want to state that this is conditional based on how the market acts tomorrow. At the moment, don't know what's going to happen because of how shitty those aapl and amzn earning reports were but I can share my opinion on how Roblox looks from this point in time.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, let's just say I haven't seen a better looking inverse head and shoulders since SNOW a couple weeks ago. Check it's chart and you will see it pretty clearly and also see how the stock cruised after breakout.  The chart below shows the current head and shoulders Roblox is in. It broke out of trend on big volume at the end of the day prior to the general market melt up indicating it may follow through with a larger scale breakout based on Technicals alone.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/TE0U2gof\n\nThere are a couple other reasons why this may be the best time to get into this play. Facebooks rebranding to Meta says it all. Facebook is rebranding to Meta to highlight it's focus on the metaverse, a field that will be seeing huge growth in the coming years. There is no other player bigger than Roblox in the metaverse field at the moment. Roblox is already hosting virtual concerts by the likes of 21 pilots and other popular artists. They are also partnering with companies like Chipotle to bring advertisements to the users of it's platform, an interesting new revenue stream. All in all, Roblox is more than just a kids game; it represents the first real comprehensive metaverse project. This will likely continue to attract big partnerships, maybe Facebook some day.\n\nAnother thing to look forward to is the fact that their earnings report is right around the corner. I don't have a stance on how the stock may perform post earnings but I do know there is a strong chance it runs in anticipation of earnings as many other stocks do. This adds to draw of this play.\n\nTldr: great looking chart, good sympathy play for facebooks rebrand to Meta, and upcoming earnings make this a play that you should consider.\n\nPositions: 11/05 86c", "id": "qhwg36", "created_utc": 1635454693.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Why FD if you are bullish on the company longterm?
