The federal government added $600 more per week to unemployment benefits already provided by the states. Even as states have worked to cut benefits, the wages received are still comparable to ones at a regular job.\n2. Inflation rate is higher than the Wages growth rate \u2013 reduced motivation to return to work\n3. People are worried about returning to a more rigid work schedule.\n4. Some people have truly thrived with the newfound flexibility of working remotely.\n5. People are worried that microaggressions at work will worsen your mental health.\n6. People are simply still worried about getting exposed to COVID-19.\n\n**For many, the pandemic has been a wake-up call that revealed how much we actually neglected our self-care before now. Now, many of us have gotten a taste of better balance and aren\u2019t ready to give it up. We want our freedom \u2013 we want to be freelancers.**\n\n# Currently there are two public traded Gig companies: Upwork (UPWK) and Fivver (FVRR).\n\nHere are a comparison table between the two:\n\n|**Company**|**market cap**|**P/S**|**EV/S**|**Revenue**|**Revenue Grow**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Upwork**|6.89|15.5|15.63|440.7|41.90%|\n|**Fivver**|6.35|23.51|24.97|251.81|59.70%|\n\nIt\u2019s true that Fivver is growing at faster rate than Upwork, but it just can\u2019t justify the financial ratios difference between them. **Fivver, simply put, is much more expensive than Upwork**.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, Fivver is a great company but it still mainly focuses on End user / small projects, while Upwork is primarily about mid/large scale projects, which is what this paradigm shift is all about.\n\n**Upwork** has collaborations with major Fortune 500 companies including Microsoft, Samsung and Zoom, as more commercial giants turning to online freelancing platforms to find knowledge workers.\n\nSo what do you think? Upwork to the moon and beyond?", "id": "q88wss", "created_utc": 1634246660.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "Work for Fortune 50 company.
