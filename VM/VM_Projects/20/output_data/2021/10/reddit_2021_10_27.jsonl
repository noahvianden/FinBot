{"title": "What to expect as China\u2019s property developers continue to default", "selftext": " Following the default of other Chinese property developers, Modern Land also defaulted on  their $250 million bond payment (1). This comes after low property sales in September, the  downgrading of several Chinese property developers\u2019 bonds(Namely Evergrande in September), and one  of the largest Chinese property developers, Evergrande, announcing difficulties with $300 billion of debt (2). It is estimated right now that nearly $100 billion of that debt is owed to US investors. Other notable  events include Fantasia defaulting earlier this month and Sinic Holdings looking to default on bond debt  soon. With all property developers in China estimated to be $33 trillion in debt by Nomura Investments,  Siwei saying that \u201cnearly every developer having borrowings in disguise\u201d (3), and $64 billion in dollar  denominated bonds (4), which make up nearly half of all dollar-denominated junk bonds, the future  looks daunting for Chinese property developers and the Chinese real estate market. Clearly, as property  developers in China continue to default, it can have serious repercussions on the Chinese economy as  well as the US bond market.\n With real estate making up over 25% of the Chinese economic markets(5), what can investors  expect as the situation continues? Will other property developers fall like dominoes or will the  government try to intervene on the situation? If property developers liquidate their real estate holdings  and assets in order to pay their bond debt and not default, that could also devalue the very real estate  which they are trying to sell. Furthermore, it would have profound effects on the emerging Chinese  middle-class who have almost all investments in real-estate because of excellent promised ROI and a  very volatile stock market (6). Such worries sparked protests at Evergrande\u2019s headquarters earlier this  month (7), with demonstrators storming inside and demanding their investments back from the  company. These worries have caused China\u2019s central authorities to issue warnings for local authorities  to prepare for serious civil unrest (8). And even if the government were to intervene and prop up the  real-estate market or simply bail out these failing developers, there would still be some fallout. It could  be expected that the government would only bail out debt to Chinese financiers and snub international  investors. Though most notably, because it would take billions, or even trillions, of dollars to solve this  issue the Yuan would undergo high inflation.\n Even with the Hang Seng and Shanghai markets seeing an uptrend in the last several months,  investors in the Chinese market could expect a downturn should property developers continue to  default on their debts. This would not only affect the real-estate market in China, but also other sectors  such as commodities and finance. All in all, the trend of property developers defaulting on their bond payments looks very dangerous for anyone who wants to invest in the Chinese markets. Trillions of dollars of debt along with  a slowdown in the Chinese real-estate market look like they could cause a serious downtrend in the  Chinese economy as a whole .\n\n*Edited for spacing*", "id": "qh8oo5", "created_utc": 1635374787.0, "score": 47, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "Have you ever heard of paragraphs?", "score": 157, "replies": [{"body": "Godzilla read this and died", "score": 40, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1520697921514511}, {"body": "I originally had this written as a PDF.

It's very much a social issue as well as an economic one. GDP growth will take a hit due to reduction in construction activity, but they have ambitious plans to invest in green energy infrastructure for the next 10 years so that should compensate. Construction will probably continue in the less developed regions in the West of the country, which tend to be far behind the Eastern and Southern coastal regions; they are likely to support affordable housing programs as part of that and those regions still need a lot of investment in modern transportation and communication infrastructure.\n\nOn the other hand they want to encourage the population to invest more in stocks, which is why they plan to open the market to retail investors; since they reached the conclusion that this would be a more productive use of Chinese savings. This should prop up the stock market and make it go up in the next few years. They are also opening up the HK market to mainland retail investors and the mainland market to foreign investors. So we are likely to see much more Chinese money in the Chinese stock market in the next years.\n\nThe housing market is more isolated from financial markets in China than in the US because most banks are state owned and not allowed to deal in CDO derivatives. Though there is of course some relation though the wealth effect. However Chinese families are very high savers and have been using housing as a savings and investment instrument, so they might use the stock market similarly in the future. That's why the government wants to clamp down on speculation and insure more orderly markets.\n\nThe Chinese government tries to engineer a transition to a more consumer-oriented and high-tech economy with better levels of financialization as part of their plan to bring China to developed nation status by 2030.
