But energy stocks have surged 50% since then.\n\nAnd according to Lakos-Bujas, it isn\u2019t over.\n\nOil prices have returned to pre-pandemic levels\u2014and then some. In fact, oil prices are 25% above pre-covid levels. [Brent prices](https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/) were trading just under $67 in January 2020, but have rallied above $80 per barrel now.\n\nEnergy stocks, however, have failed to rally as much, still down 2% from the pre-covid era, and are trading at a near-record low relative to their book value.\n\n\u201cWe expect the sector to re-rate as companies deliver strong results, raise guidance, and reiterate their focus on shareholder capital return rather than unprofitable market share gains,\u201d Lakos-Bujas\u2019 client note read on Thursday, according to Bloomberg.\n\n\u201cIn a world where most assets have broadly re-rated due to lower rates and liquidity, energy still offers non-linear earnings growth potential for several years at an attractive valuation.\u201d\n\nJPMorgan sees years of underinvestment on low profitability and strict environmental policies cutting into supply\u2014an issue that the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated.\n\nBut now, the case for prolonged outperformance of the energy sector is upon us, JPMorgan strategists said.\n\nBy Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.com\n\nSource: [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/JPMorgan-Energy-Stocks-Still-Have-Room-To-Run.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/JPMorgan-Energy-Stocks-Still-Have-Room-To-Run.html)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Commentary:**\n\nI continue to hear \"fake truths\" or opinions that are simply wrong on the current state of Oil & Gas Equities (and the state of the industry in general), so I will address the top ones here before I get into what I think is the best way to play the Oil & Gas Boom:\n\n* **False**: \"This is just another fake energy crisis/supply-crunch\"\n   * **Truth:** This supply crunch is very real, just read look at what's happening already in Britain/Europe.  **China** is panic buying oil and gas from anywhere they can get it (including coal from arch rival Australia) and have recently sold off oil to domestic companies from their strategic reserves...**which they've never done. EVER.** \n* **False: \"**Oil is going to plummet once OPEC cranks up production.\"\n   * **True:**  OPEC nations and their economies are almost entirely dependent on oil production and they are currently experiencing record profits and revenue.  There is practically no logical reason for them to want or work towards anything below $80/barrel.  They have shown true solidarity throughout 2021 in their discipled production cuts and they are all reaping the rewards now.\n* **False:** \"The Biden administration hates oil, so everyone is going to be driving electric vehicles by \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (insert magical date here) and oil demand will vanish\".\n   * **Truth:** The President of the United States actually has very little control on the global price of oil.  A prime example of this was the recent pleads from the US for OPEC to increase supply.  There response was a very swift, \"NO\", and they have not added any additional supply on top of their scheduled monthly increases that were decided on in early summer of 2021. \n* **So if you believe in any of the \"false truths\" listed above, by all means, please sit on the sidelines while I and others invest in oil and gas companies who are positioned to straight-up pillage their way through what will surely be a long and painful transition to \"green\"/renewable energy.**\n* Just to be clear, when I say pillage, I mean that certain Oil & Gas companies are literally going to be hemorrhaging free cash flow and giving that cash back to investors via **huge share buy-backs** and increased dividends.\n* **For the rest of us, there is serious money to be made in Oil & Gas Stocks**\n\nAs stated in the article above, the fact that the Oil and Gas \"re-rate\" hasn't happened yet is further proof that certain O & G stocks have a TON of room to run.  As I hinted at the beginning of this post, my personal favorite play for this inevitable BOOM is **MRO** for the reasons listed below.  Yes, there are other good stocks and plays to be made, but my personal favorite is MRO:\n\n**\\*\\*And for those out there who say that I'm being redundant,** **MRO is up over 40% since I began posting on MRO (and Oil/Gas in general) about a month ago.**  I will continue to post fact-based analysis that strengthens this thesis, the run is just beginning. \n\n# MRO\n\n* MRO has committed 40% of Free Cash Flow to **Stock Buy-Backs = Over $1 Billion for Q4-2021**\n   * **When they pull the trigger on the buy-backs, the institutional investors will pour in**\n   * That's currently 10% of their Market Cap, this will have a huge impact on the stock price\n* **MRO breakeven is below $35/barrel** (one of the lowest in the industry)\n   * Bank of American and Goldman Sachs are predicting $80-100/barrel by end of 2021\n* MRO has a 50/50 oil and gas production split: With **both prices at multi-year highs**, they are going to make a killing\n* MRO paid down $1.4 Billion in long-term debt in Q1/Q2 of 2021\n* MRO is the smallest Oil Company in the S&P 500 (but not a Micro Cap that could be acquired easily)\n* **MRO is up over 250% from October 2020**\n* **Position:** I am long on MRO in a straight share purchase given that there will be volatility in the market over the next few months and the exact timing is difficult to predict.

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 11th, 2021", "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 11th, 2021.\n\n# **Stock market on comeback trail heads into what\u2019s supposed to be another stellar earnings season - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/stock-market-on-comeback-trail-heads-into-whats-supposed-to-be-another-stellar-earnings-season-.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks proved hard to keep down this week, and the start of the earnings season next week could further bolster the comeback if profits roll in as expected or better.\n*****\n> The major averages notched a winning week after overcoming a debt ceiling debacle in Washington. Lawmakers passed a short-term deal that will extend the debt ceiling until December, kicking that overhang for the market down the road.\n*****\n> This week\u2019s price action also overcame surging oil prices and a disappointing jobs report, with investors buying bank and energy shares.\n*****\n> \u201cIn the face of Washington drama, delta worries, multiyear highs in crude oil, and a much weaker than expected jobs number, you have to be impressed by how stocks were able to bounce back this week,\u201d LPL Financial chief market strategist Ryan Detrick said.\n*****\n> https://i.imgur.com/Zh7JRt2.png\n*****\n> A market pullback that began in September brought the S&P 500 down more than 5% from its record at one point Monday, before stocks mounted a comeback. For the week, the S&P 500 added back 0.8% and sits just 3.4% away from its record.\n*****\n> Goldman Sachs stuck by its bullish year-end forecast earlier this week, predicting stocks would start to climb the wall of worries. And they did.\n*****\n> Goldman chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said in a note to clients that his year-end S&P 500 price target for 2021 is still 4,700, which is nearly 7% above its current level.\n*****\n> The firm said earnings growth, not valuation expansion, was the primary driver of the S&P 500\u2032s 17% return year to date, adding that should still be the case.\n*****\n> # Earnings season begins\n> The third-quarter earnings season \u2014 which kicks off next week with big bank earnings \u2014 is expected to be another strong series of reports, despite some worries about supply chain issues and higher costs. Third-quarter earnings are expected to have risen 27.6% year over year, according to FactSet. That would be the third-highest growth rate since 2010.\n*****\n> \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some record earnings seasons the past few quarters, so all eyes will be on if earnings can help justify stocks near all-time high levels,\u201d Detrick said. \u201cWe do expect another solid earnings season, but we\u2019ve seen some high profile warnings already, so corporate America could have a rather high bar to clear this quarter. Buckle up.\u201d\n*****\n> Bank earnings are the main focus next week with JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs set to report.\n*****\n> After a range-bound few months for bank stocks, analysts are looking ahead to catalysts that could fuel the next phase in their recovery. Wall Street expects loan growth, interest rates and reserve releases to play into the major banks\u2019 reports.\n*****\n> \u201cEarnings for the third quarter quarter should again be strong and mostly outpace expectations,\u201d Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen said. \u201cHours worked in the third quarter rose by about 5% suggesting real GDP for the quarter may be close to 7%. With most companies reporting strong pricing power, solid real GDP growth should result in another surprisingly strong corporate earnings season.\u201d\n*****\n> Paulsen sees earnings season rewarding cyclicals, like banks, and small caps more than technology stocks.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the stock market is already showing signs of a leadership shift away from slow economic growth favorites including growth, tech, and defensive toward more the economically sensitive areas of small caps and cyclical sectors,\u201d he added.\n*****\n> # Supply chain, higher cost warnings?\nWhile the earnings season should be strong, there are likely to be some warning signs about inflation and supply constraints that could scare the market about the year-end set-up.\n*****\n> \u201cThe risks of higher inflation, Fed tapering and what will likely be a choppy earnings season are still with us,\u201d Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said.\n*****\n> There was some foreshadowing of this last week, when Bed Bath and Beyond shares cratered 25% after the company said it saw a steep drop-off in traffic in August. Bed Bath & Beyond saw inflation costs escalating over the summer months, especially toward the end of its second quarter in August, which corroded profits.\n*****\n> What investors know going into the third quarter \u2014 from company guidance \u2014 is that there could be haves and have nots this earnings season.\n*****\n> FactSet data shows that 47 S&P 500 companies have issued negative earnings guidance for the third quarter, and 56 companies have issued positive outlooks.\n*****\n> # Fed headwind ahead?\n> The headline jobs number Friday was a major disappointment, as the economy added just 194,000 jobs in September, well below the the Dow Jones estimate of 500,000. On the positive side, the unemployment rate fell to a much lower point than economists forecast. At 4.8%, that\u2019s the same level seen in late 2016.\n*****\n> It\u2019s unclear if the number changes the calculus for when and how fast the Federal Reserve will slow its $120 billion-per-month bond-buying program.\n*****\n> \u201cIn our view these figures are good enough, and when combined with the debt-ceiling can being kicked down the road, likely solidifies November as \u2018go time\u2019 for tapering,\u201d Wells Fargo Securities senior equity analyst Christopher Harvey said.\n*****\n> \u201cWe continue to expect a choppy equity market rally and a two-to-four-week tech bounce, but the bounce probably peters out next month when the Fed says those magical words: We will begin to taper,\u201d he added.\n\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/WuOc7cb.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnJ6ZF2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/CojntqX.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/mxZnyBJ.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/eZbwxOb.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JPCsx2m.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/kyfY7Xn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zEMv32q.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uaj9G7t.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VAaeJ4E.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/fgsZNEH.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/W5HmLSK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/DDVPGco.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Best and Worst Performing S&P 500 Stocks in 2021\n\n> The fourth quarter is now off to the races and we thought it worthwhile to check in on the best and worst-performing S&P 500 stocks on a year-to-date basis. As shown below, there are currently six members of the index that have rallied over 100% this year. Apt for the year that its vaccine has rolled out, the biggest gainer of these has been Moderna (MRNA) with a 196.12% rally. It now has a market cap of $124.87 billion versus a market cap of only $41 billion at the start of the year. Of the 20 best performers, MRNA is also the only one with a market cap above $100 billion. The next largest is ConocoPhillips (COP) with a $95.76 billion market cap. COP is one of multiple Energy stocks on this list as well. Of the top 20 performers, Energy sector names dominate the list with 8 members.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-1.png))**\n\n> Pivoting to the other end of the spectrum, Las Vegas Sands (LVS) is down the most this year having been cut by 36.18%. IPG Photonics (IPGP), Lamb Weston Holdings (LW), Viatris (VTRS), MarketAxess (MKTX), and Global Payments (GPN) also have fallen by at least 25%. Once again, there is only one member of this list with a market cap above $100 billion: Qualcomm (QCOM). One other interesting factor to note of the worst performers is there are several stocks that were at some point plays on pandemic trends, whether those be reopening or stay at home. For example, in addition to LVS, another gaming/reopening name, Wynn Resorts (WYNN), ranks as the eighth-worst performer YTD. Additionally, strong performers during the onset of the pandemic like Clorox (CLX), Activision Blizzard (ATVI), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) are all down double digits this year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-SPX-2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Intraday Commodity Spikes\n\n> Since the late spring, both silver and gold have been in steady downtrends spending much of that time below their 50-DMAs. Those downtrends remain in place, but both metals did find a short-term bottom on September 29th. While they have been rallying in the past week and a half, today each one has stalled out. From the early morning leading up to the Nonfarm Payrolls report, precious metals ramped higher with a surge immediately following the weaker than expected report. Only a couple hours after the release, gold and silver had erased a large portion of their earlier gains. In fact, silver is now 2.15% below its intraday high and gold is 1.36% below its high. For gold, in particular, that intraday reversal also marked a rejection of its 50-DMA which it\u2014as well as silver\u2014has struggled to stay above for most of the past several months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-GC-SI.png))**\n\n> Crude oil is yet another commodity that is currently down off of its intraday highs, and like gold, the reversal came at a pretty interesting level. At its high Friday morning, front-month WTI futures rose above $80 for the first time since November 2014.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL.png))**\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/100821-CL2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # The Job Market Continues To Frustrate In September\n\n> The September payroll report likely created more questions than it answered.\n\n> The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics released its September employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added a disappointing 194,000 jobs during the month, falling well short of Bloomberg-surveyed economists\u2019 median forecast for a gain of 500,000. This comes on the heels of a lukewarm August report, which did receive an upward revision of 131,000. Somewhat contradictory, the unemployment rate fell more than forecast to 4.8% in September, beating expectations, though that was paired with a reduced labor force participation rate of 61.6% when expectations called for an increase.\n\n> \u201cThe observation window for this report likely came too soon for positive catalysts to really gain traction,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cLeisure and hospitality jobs, a proxy for economic reopening, were only marginally higher. We take this to mean Delta\u2019s waning impact will likely be more evident in October\u2019s report where we expect to see reopening momentum reassert itself.\u201d\n\n> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, in-person segments of the labor market such as leisure and hospitality jobs grew steadily during the first half of the year when COVID-19 remained under relative control. However, the latest flare-up has dampened that trend. We expect to see renewed growth in this sector as the delta variant continues to abate.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.8.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> As mentioned, definitive takeaways from this report are difficult to come by due to the offsetting nature of the report. On the one hand, headline numbers came in very weak, but private payrolls, as well as manufacturing payrolls, fared better. The unemployment rate experienced a significant drop, but interpreting that number becomes muddied when considering the fact that we are already experiencing a significant worker shortage and the participation rate is declining, not increasing, as we would hope to see in a true recovery.\n\n> What is more, because the observation window for the report cuts off mid-month, we cannot yet draw conclusions about the impact of school reopening and the lapsing of enhanced unemployment benefits\u2014hotly debated crosscurrents\u2014plus the aforementioned waning delta impact. Regarding the inflation debate\u2014average hourly earnings rose 0.6% month over month and 4.6% year over year. And while wages are undeniably growing and helping to fuel inflation, the data are not mix-adjusted and therefore are inflated due to the suppressed growth in the in-person, lower-wage segment of the labor market.\n\n> The biggest question, though, is what this means for the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) asset tapering plans. The market had all but expected the Fed to announce a tapering timeline at its next meeting coming into this report, with the caveat that Fed Chair Jerome Powell needed only to see a \u201creasonably good\u201d job report first. Whether September\u2019s surprise report has cleared that low bar or not now becomes an open question, one which the market had all but dismissed as a formality previously.\n\n> Indeed, in the aftermath of the report\u2019s release Treasury markets immediately began pricing in a possible delay to any taper, and equity markets gyrated between positive and negative territory as they struggled to process whether bad news should actually be considered good news in this context. We will have to see in the coming weeks whether this report will be substantial enough to bring on the much-anticipated taper announcement, but one thing is for sure\u2014there are no gimmies in this labor market recovery.\n*****\n\n> # Columbus Day Performance\n\n> Columbus Day is an interesting trading day for financial markets as it is one of the few trading days of the year when the equity market is open, but the bond market is closed. This may lead investors to think that equity markets should perform positively, as investors do not have credit markets to allocate capital to on that specific day. However, looking at the S&P 500's historical performance on Columbus Day over the last 25 years doesn't necessarily show a real positive bias. Columbus Day tends to act just like any other trading day. Over the last 25 years, median performance on Columbus Day has been a gain of 10 basis points (bps) with positive returns 55.6% of the time. While that's slightly higher than the median one-day gain of 7 bps for all trading days over the last 25 years, the difference isn't significant. That's not to say that Columbus Day hasn't seen some outliers, though. Who can forget in 2008, during the middle of the Financial Crisis, when the S&P 500 rallied more than 11% on Columbus Day!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Day-of.png))**\n\n> For the week of Columbus Day, the S&P 500's median gain has been 0.31% with positive returns 63% of the time which also isn't extraordinary relative to average weekly returns for the S&P 500 over the last 25 years. The worst Columbus Day weeks were in 1999 (-6.63%) and 2018 (-4.10%) while the best were in 1998 (+7.32%), 2002 (5.87%), and 2011 (+5.98%). Interestingly enough, in 2008, even after rallying over 11% on Columbus Day, the S&P 500 finished the week up just 4.60% as it erased more than half of its gains from the holiday session.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Week-of.png))**\n\n> The table below lists the S&P 500's performance leading up to and after Columbus Day for each of the last 25 years. With a decline of over 2.5% since the start of September, this year ranks as the weakest performance for the equity market since 2014.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Columbus-Day-Table-100821.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # The Most Important Chart In The World\n\n> And just like that, the calendar turned to October and volatility picked up in a big way, with three consecutive 1% moves for the S&P 500 Index to start the month. As we noted in our October preview, this month gets a bad rap for being a bearish month (it isn\u2019t), but it absolutely owns the title as the most volatile month.\n\n> t took nearly a full year, but the S&P 500 finally had its first 5% pullback of 2021, thus ending hopes of 2021 joining 1954, 1958, 1964, 1993, 1995, and 2017 as the only years to go a full calendar year without a 5% move lower.\n\n> \u201cVolatility is the price of admission,\u201d explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cSure, we\u2019d all prefer stocks go straight up forever, but that isn\u2019t reality. Investors must learn to embrace and accept the eventual scares and bouts of volatility that are common even in the strongest bull markets.\u201d\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, since 1980, stocks experience a 14.2% peak-to-trough pullback on average during the year, putting the recent 5% pullback in perspective. In fact, 21 out of the past 41 years saw at least a 10% correction. Incredibly, 12 of those years finished in the green and those 12 years gained an average of 17.0%. Who could forget last year\u2019s 34% bear market and move back to up 16% by the end of the year? In other words, big pullbacks can happen even in years that see outsized gains, which is why this chart is so important for investors.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> The last new all-time high for the S&P 500 was on September 2, but as of the end of September there were still 54 new all-time highs in 2021, the second most ever with one quarter to go. The good news? Previous years that saw a lot new highs the first three quarters usually had strong performance the final quarter.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Taking things a step further, this year the S&P 500 produced one of its best ever year-to-date gains through September, up 14.7% with a quarter to go. It turns out that good starts to a year tend to resolve higher. In fact, 9 of the past 10 years the S&P 500 was up at least 12.5% with a quarter to go there were further gains in the fourth quarter. As you can see below, the returns are greatly skewed due to 1987, but the median return in the final quarter of the year is an impressive 5.2% (versus the average fourth quarter return of 4.0%).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.6.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Performance Through Q3 And its Impact on Q4 Performance\n\n> Every year, the makeup and number of sectors that outperform the S&P 500 changes. This year, four sectors (Energy, Financials, Real Estate, and Communication Services) outperformed the S&P 500 through the end of Q3, while last year it was only three sectors that outperformed in the first three quarters of the year (Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Communication Services).\n\n> As we all know, past performance does not indicate future performance, and in looking at sectors that have outperformed the S&P 500 in the first three quarters of prior years compared to how they performed in Q4, the same holds true. The table below lists the number of sectors that outperformed and underperformed the S&P 500 in the first three quarters of each year since 2000 and then shows their median performance during Q4 of the same year. Looking at a summary of the annual results, it's almost a coinflip as to whether or not the leading sectors in the first three quarters of a given year will continue to outperform in Q4. On average, the sectors that outperform YTD through 9/30 have averaged a Q4 gain of 3.58% (median: +6.40%) with positive returns 76% of the time. Sectors that lag the S&P 500 in the first three quarters of the year average a rest of year gain of 3.67% (median: 5.95%) with gains 71% of the time. While the term 'strength begets strength' has historically been applicable to the broader market, at the sector level, buying the YTD winners (or losers) ahead of Q4 in expectation of continued momentum to close out the year (or a mean reversion bounce) hasn't offered any material outperformance.\n\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/Snap227.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Typical October Trading: Volatile Start Sets Up Rally through Month\u2019s End\n\n> Over the last twenty-one years, the full month of October has been a solid month for the market. DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all recorded gains ranging from 0.6% by Russell 2000 to 1.9% by NASDAQ. But these gains have come with volatile trading, most notably during the early days of the month. October has opened softly with mild gains on its first trading day by DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000. On the second day, all five indexes have been weak followed by a rebound on the third trading day before additional weakness pulls the market lower through the seventh trading day.
