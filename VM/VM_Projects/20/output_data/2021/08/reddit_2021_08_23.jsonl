Start with one call on...say...SPY or VOO (both are SP500)... maybe one call each as close to current price as possible. Buy 1 to 3 months out or more if you like. See how that works. If it performs, set a sell price and move it at a profit you like. Don't get too greedy at first. Just see how it works.\n\nNow, nothing is guaranteed. Keep that in mind.

{"title": "Why Upstart Will Make You a Millionaire.. in 5-10 years", "selftext": "Ok, maybe not a millionaire, but the upside potential here is ridiculous... hear me out.\n\nI've been heavily reading up on [Upstart](https://www.upstart.com/) for the last few months, and I believe we're looking at a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here (despite being up [362.37%](https://www.google.com/search?q=upst&rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB885GB885&oq=upst) since IPO already). From everything I've read about the technology, leadership and market and competition, I think we're looking at a future tech behemoth currently hiding in plain sight. \n\nI've compiled my notes in the report below, if you need the *executive degen TLDR*, or prefer visual notes you can head straight to the bottom.\n\n# Company History\n\nBorrowing & lending is a practice as old as time. Our economies are based on borrowing be it at government level, institutional level, or even at the individual level. Whats mind-blowing is that borrowing and lending remained largely the same for the last [5000 years](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230554511_1). The problem Upstart set out to solve is the question of how to quantify the borrower's risk of defaulting. In simple terms, there are a lot of \"[good borrowers\"](https://www.upstart.com/about#credit-limits-2) out there, but lenders generally have a hard time identifying them using current systems which are [old and dated](https://www.fico.com/25years/). So just like shopping (AMZN, SHOP..etc), EV (TSLA) and consumer tech (AAPL),  consumer lending, a [$4.2 trillion market](https://www.notion.so/361e12bb766a4ad0bd38ffbd2ce37169), was due a massive tech disruption (UPST).\n\nKey dates:\n\n- Founded in 2012\n- [Pivoted](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2014/05/23/why-upstart-abandoned-education-crowdfunding-to.html) from its initial niche (crowdfunding loans) to the larger [$84b](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2021/08/13/upstart-can-ai-kill-the-fico-score/) market of personal loans in 2014.\n- Entered the auto-lending market in [2020](https://www.upstart.com/blog/introducing-ai-enabled-auto-loans?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_LfWzrC0S2PevMQ6xYcT2HwpIxXCbBEE0HeX9COT3a78-1629740458-0-gqNtZGzNAyWjcnBszQ-R)\n- [IPOed](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/upstart-prices-ipo-at-20-for-market-cap-of-1-45-billion-11608092379) late 2020\n\n# Leadership\n\nThe story of Upstart is quite unusual. The company was founded by three people with diverse backgrounds expertises, and even generations. Dave Girouard was the [former head of Google Enterprise](https://venturebeat.com/2012/03/16/googles-president-of-enterprise-dave-girouard-is-leaving-to-launch-his-own-startup/), and before that he was an executive at Apple. His co-founders are Anna Counselman, the former [manager of Online Sales & Operations](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/12/06/silicon-valley-40-under-40-anna.html) at Google and Paul Gu, a university student who dropped out of the computer science program at Yale to start the company (also a [Thiel Fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship)). For a founding story, its unusual for three people to come together and decide to build a company on the spot. But 9 years later, they are still at the helm of a profitable and disruptive company. \n\n# Upstart's Business\n\nUpstart's business caters to two distinct segments: [Individuals](https://www.upstart.com/personal-loans) and [banks](https://www.upstart.com/for-banks).\n\nTheir offerings to individuals consist of a variety of personal loan products, examples of these include:\n\n- Credit card and Debt consolidation loans\n- Home improvement loans\n- Medical loans\n- Wedding loans\n- and Moving loans\n\nFor banks, Upstart offers its AI technology as a way for banks to improve their archaic lending processes. This is kind of genius because instead of competing with banks, Upstart [partners with them and complements their services](https://vimeo.com/489878274). Studies completed with several  US banks suggested that Upstart\u2019s model [could approve almost three times](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_52250deb9dc2f9889c94cd45e31c286d7522a9f8-1629210053-0-gqNtZGzNAuKjcnBszQvO#results-to-date)  the number of borrows at the same loss rate as traditional models, as well as make a reduction of 75% in defaults at the same approval rate, this is unprecedented in the lending business.\n\n## The Problem\n\nAt the moment, [90% of the top lenders in the United States use FICO scoring](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-fico-score/) to assess credit-worthiness, this is a scoring system first developed in 1989 which is comprised of five components:\n\n- Payment history\n- Amount owed\n- Length of credit history\n- How many times someone has applied for new credit\n- The variety of credit products you currently have\n\n## The Solution\n\nThis old scoring system prevents many people from getting loans at a reasonable rate. By comparison, Upstart leverages [1600 different data points](https://vimeo.com/492637158) [fast forward to 05:35]  that have been trained on more than 10 million repayment events to reach decision within seconds. This machine learning model continues to get more effective as it processes more repayment data [!!]\n\nAnd this is Upstart's competitive edge. Their AI and machine learning models facilitate *better* borrower selection and provides both *higher* approval rates as well as *lower* interest rates for customers. The numbers here are staggering: tested Upstart models were found to approve [26% more borrowers than traditional models whilst yielding 10% lower average APRs for approved loans](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_cDRNu2tNRiO1uogDDmRKdDE3YeeO2hfOn4Xr6m5gmrU-1629741551-0-gqNtZGzNAuWjcnBszQzR#results-to-date). This expands access to prime credit, which is great for customers (but its also great for banks as they would approve almost **twice** as many borrowers with fewer defaults). This is a [win win](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/hybridized-banking-system-jeff-keltner?page=2) [start at 03:00] situation for both lenders and customers seeking credit, absolutely mind-blowing!\n\nUpstart's AI also increases automation throughout the lending process for banks and institutional buyers. To illustrate this point they recently reported that [71% of their loans were instantly approved and fully automated](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) -[page. 4] - with no need for document uploads, calls or waiting! \n\nUpstart is using state-of-the-art AI technology to disrupt:\n\n- [$84B unsecured personal loan market](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) [p.6] (already working product, ~4% of the market).\n- $635B auto-loans market [also p.6] (just acquired Prodigy, a leader in this space).\n- $4.2T US consumer credit market [also p.6]\n\n## How Upstart makes money\n\nFrom page 101 of Upstart's [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1647639/000119312520313385/d867925ds1a.htm):\n\n> Upstart\u2019s revenues are primarily earned in the form of three separate usage-based fees, which can be either dollar or percentage based depending on the contractual arrangement. We charge our bank partners a referral fee of 3% to 4% of the loan principal amount each time we refer a borrower who obtains a loan. Separately, we charge bank partners a platform fee of approximately 2% of loan value each time they originate a loan using our platform. These fees are contracted for and charged separately, although they are generally combined for accounting purposes as they usually represent a single performance obligation. We do not charge the borrowers on our platform any referral, platform or other similar fees for our loan matching services.\n\n> We also charge the holder of the loan (either a bank or institutional investor) an ongoing 0.5% to 1% annualized servicing fee based on the outstanding principal over the lifetime of the loan for ongoing servicing of the loan. Taken together, these fees represented 98% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In addition, we earn a small portion of our revenue from interest income and our securitization activities.\n\n## The Competition\n\nAnother point that makes the case for Upstart's future growth is just how far ahead they are from the competition. As an example the scoring methodology used by Goldman Sachs, the underwriting partner of Apple responsible for Apple Card, has been the subject of much public scrutiny and criticism in a number of recent high profile cases. One example being the case of David Hansson the creator of Ruby on Rails who in late 2019 received [20x the credit limit of his wife despite sharing the same financial ability](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/14/how-the-law-got-it-wrong-with-apple-card/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE57fF0YBl-DFkXQ2li8zbbzDR75qwiW-PyKPzfrssfgJSecSj9o_GV8iZ5SNYQlRythx0XAAqN5CTuqpV6sAoDun3fsn4ohmiBUHrqN6ooT-_fgbOIcVN4wr9C4fQrbE26BqXrhl6ttnT1xTpUKj2GUkFzf4dKoCaNFGjiOSL1t). Another more recent example is when the CEO of Cloudflare, Mathew Prince [applied for an Apple card and received credit limit of only $4500](https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1426552810896871435?s=20) at a rate of 21.99% APR, [despite being worth $4.2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/profile/matthew-prince/#:~:text=REAL%20TIME%20NET%20WORTH&text=Matthew%20Prince%2C%20CEO%20of%20Cloudflare,Microsoft%2C%20Baidu%20and%20Qualcomm%20Ventures.)!\n\nThese examples may appear trivial, and they are.. after all we are discussing billionaires being denied credit, but they are high-profile examples of the competition's inferior AI offerings. Besides, the questions and concerns around lending and borrowing in the age of artificial intelligence are very much real, and touch upon very important questions about access and fairness, an aspect of Upstart's offering that is quite compelling. [Listen to Jeff Keltner](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/digital-lending-sam-sidhu?page=3) [47:20], Upstart's head of Business development touching on Upstart's effectiveness as a fair lender:\n\n# Financials\n\nTo better understand how the business of Upstart is doing, lets take a look at their [most recent earnings report of the second quarter of 2021 published just about a week ago on August 10](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347), I will preface this by saying that its one of the best earning reports I've ever read! \n\n- **Revenue:** In the 2nd quarter of 2021 Upstart reported revenue of **$194 million**, this is an increase of - get this-  **1,018%** from the second quarter of 2020 [!!!]. I can not stress how impressive this is, even by growth stocks standards, you simply dont see numbers like this everyday!\n\n    To illustrate just how out of this world Upstart's revenue growth is, lets look at revenue growth reported by other more popular degen-type growth stocks for the same quarter: \n\n    - **[Tesla reported revenue](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22) of** $11.69 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of **98%**.\n    - **[SoFi reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/SoFi-Earnings-report_FINAL_081221_4.pdf) of** $231.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of **101%**\n    - **[Shopify's reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_presentations/2021/07/Shopify-Investor-Deck-Q2-2021.pdf) of** $1.12 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 57%\n    - **[Palantir reported revenue](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q2%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf) of** $376 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 49%\n    - **[Fiverr reported revenue](https://s23.q4cdn.com/749308338/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2_2021-Fiverr-Shareholder-Letter_FINAL.pdf) of** $75.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 60%\n    - **[Etsy reported revenue](https://s22.q4cdn.com/941741262/files/doc_presentations/2021/08/[FINAL-NAP]-Etsy-2Q-2021-Earnings-Presentation-V2.pdf) of** $529 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 23%\n\n    ...etc etc, I can go on. \n\n    Even if you account for this improvement being partly due to COVID, looking at the results sequentially you still see an improvement of 60% from $121 million in the first quarter of 2021 to $194 million in the second quarter. No matter how you look at it this is an incredible result.\n\n- Transaction Volume Growth was up **69%**\n\n    Upstart's bank partners originated 286,864 loans, totaling $2.80 billion, this is up 1,605% from the same quarter of the prior year. Conversion on rate requests was 24% in the second quarter of 2021, up from 9% in the same quarter of the prior year.\n\n- **Income from Operations:** Income from operations was $36.3 million, up from ($11.4) million the prior year.\n- **Contribution Profit:** Contribution profit was $96.7 million, up **2,171**% from in the second quarter of 2020, with a contribution margin of 52% compared to a 32% contribution margin in the second quarter of 2020.\n- **Adjusted EBITDA**. Adjusted EBITDA was $59.5 million, up from ($3.1) million in the same quarter prior year.\n\nIn terms of financial outlook for 2021, Upstart expects:\n\n- **Revenue of approximately $750 million (they have essentially raised guidance by $150 million since their previous report guided for $600 million)**\n- **Contribution Margin of approximately 45% (vs prior guidance of 42%)**\n- **Adjusted EBITDA Margin of approximately 17% (vs prior guidance of 10%)**\n\n***Sirs, do you get it?***\n\nI cant overstate how incredible these results are. As I was listening to the earnings conference call, I caught an amusing moment when the Director of Equity Research for Bank of America could not help but address the fact that he has never seen a four-digit growth figure reported in his career.. [have a listen yourself](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/gn5dbj7b) [35:40]. \n\nWhat the bank of America analyst correctly pointed out was that Upstart managed to achieve such incredible levels of growth at a time when the personal loan market across the United States was actually down.\n\n# Risks:\n\n- In terms of risks to investing in Upstart, one of the main issues facing the company is business concentration. Cross River Bank is Upstart\u2019s most significant partner, [with fees received from the bank accounting for 60% of revenue](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1edgjPy-jXuIhvLSFLkuvTMXxMDt_Kq0R/view) [p.9]. Having a single customer generating such a big portion of your revenue is a serious risk for any business. The good news is that Cross River\u2019s concentration of Upstart\u2019s business has come down meaningfully over the last year from 79% to the current 60%. The hope is that, increased Upstart partnership with other banks will diversify its funding base and thus reduce concentration risk.\n- Another risk is increased [regulations](https://gfycat.com/coldcanineeyas-nate-dogg-regulator-warren-g) or legal scrutiny that can stop or restrict Upstart's AI models. This is obviously a real risk, particularly given how new AI lending is. The good news is that Upstart received a [no-action letter](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-issues-no-action-letter-facilitate-use-artificial-intelligence-pricing-and-underwriting-loans/) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that essentially guarantees no supervisory or enforcement action against Upstart for the next few years.\n\n## Future\n\n- In terms of Upstart's future plans for expansion, the company plans to target the $635 billion Auto lending market. [They've already expanded to 47 states](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) (up from 33 states last quarter), thus having access to more than 95% of the US population. They've also increased their dealership footprint by 24% sequentially this quarter.\n\n    But their biggest move in the auto lending space has to be the [acquisition of Prodigy Software](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-03-17/upstart-to-acquire-prodigy-software-a-leading-automotive-retail-software-provider) which is a leader in the automotive retail software space. Paul Gu, the co-founder of Upstart describes **Prodigy as the\" Shopify for car dealerships\"** .\n\n    Through acquisition of Prodigy Upstart was able to generate vehicle sales of over $1 billion this quarter, another very impressive result. They also already have five bank partners signed up for auto lending on their platform.\n\n- Recently, Upstart filled a newly created [General Manager of Mortgage position](https://twitter.com/saxena_puru/status/1426859770833637380). This signals early stages of offering a mortgage product which would mean entry to a massive $2.5 trillion dollar category.\n\nTo conclude this section on the future of Upstart, I will leave you with [a short clip](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1697077/8693359-investing-in-ai-episode-10-dave-girouard-from-upstart?client_source=twitter_card&player_type=full_screen) of Upstart's CEO discussing how the company is setting out to be the biggest player in AI lending in the world. My main takeaway from this interview was just how early we are to the Upstart story [23:45].\n\n# Putting my money where my mouth is\n\nIn short, [YES](https://streamable.com/73pefs). I am a mere mortal so no over the top yolos. I mainly invest in growth stocks and have recently been adding to my Upstart position like crazy, taking it from 11% to around 30% of my portfolio. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nUpstart reminds me so much of Shopify at the beginning of its growth-spurt, in the sense that it is a future giant hiding in plain sight. Do your own due diligence on the company before making any investments, but after many many hours of consuming every bit of data I can get on the company, I believe it will a massive success over the next 5 years, and we will all look back and wonder why we didnt invest enough.\n\nThis is a once-in-a-life-time opportunity imho.\n\n### Executive degen TLDR summary:\n\n- New IPO (Dec 2020).\n- Seeking to disrupt a huge market ($4.2 trillion).\n- They have the best tech in the space, with a 9 year lead in lending AI/ML (very good moat).\n- Exceptional leadership, with founders being high level Google execs who left to start the company.\n- Incredible financial results reported in their Q2'2021, growing +10x as much as the likes of TSLA.\n- No fear of regulation as they have a \"No Action\" letter from US government body.\n- Still at the very tip of their growth journey, having only 4% market share of the unsecured personal loan space = massive growth runway.\n\nIf you've read all of that I salute you friend!", "id": "pa7u7v", "created_utc": 1629749616.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.48, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019ve read so much about upstart, and I love the marketing, so I did the next logical thing and tried them and a few of their competitors - \n\nUpstart, SoFi, and Rocket Loans. \n\nNone of them do a \u201chard pull\u201d on credit for the application so I recommend everyone do this. \n\nResults - all the same, give or take a few decimals on interest rate. \n\nUpstart literally just farms your info out to different lenders. They don\u2019t actually service your loan, unlike Rocket. Upstart is just a broker. This business model has been around for years. I like the concept and understand others might have more unique experiences but the best terms i was offered was actually from SoFi (though not enough to make a big difference).

Upstart's key benefit is that most approvals are automated. I don't think you can automate mortgages; banks are not gonna like it\n\n\\- Their Q2 revenue growth as you pointed out is due to covid. They had a terrible Q2 in 2020. This is actually a real concern cause it shows that their business can really get hit hard. Last year it was covid, next year it can be interest rates\n\n\\- The rise of BNPL\\*\\* companies will eat some of their revenue (even though currently they serve a different niche mostly)\n\nOverall, amazing IPO.

International expansion is still ways off, but if they actually make true on their plans within the US consumer credit market, licensing their tech to financial institutions abroad will be viable, by then their models will be way ahead of others (huge if btw). \n\n- Yes, they had a lousy Q2'2020 but even when comparing 2021's Q1 to Q2, you have sequential growth of 60%, pretty amazing.\n\nI totally see what you mean with it being risky, historically there has been outsized short interest, but boy did their financial results surprise me.

{"title": "Ratio Review: Price to Book", "selftext": "#**Introduction**\nThe world of finance is absolutely filled with people making claims about what\u2019s good or bad, how you should or shouldn\u2019t do something, and what you can and can\u2019t achieve. My goal is to take a look at these claims, spend some time researching them, and then share what I\u2019ve found. I\u2019m going to investigate various strategies, ratios, indicators, portfolios, and general market concepts with the goal of determining which ones are just noise and which ones might help you get ahead. \n\nIn this write up I\u2019m going to be taking a deep dive into another incredibly popular metric \u2013 the price to book ratio. I\u2019m going to start with a walkthrough of how you calculate it, then I\u2019m going to cover how it should be used, then I\u2019m going to go over some of the pros and cons of it, and most importantly I\u2019m going to see if it gives you any kind of advantage when selecting stocks. \n\n#**What is P/B?**\nA company\u2019s price to book ratio is the ratio between the company\u2019s current share price and their current book value per share. Book value is essentially the value of a company from the perspective of an accountant. Accountants don\u2019t care about future earnings or potential speculation. They look at the current value of the business by taking all of the company\u2019s assets and subtracting all of the company\u2019s liabilities. This is then divided by the number of shares to get the book value per share. Once you have that you simply divide the share price by the book value per share to get the price to book ratio. \n\n#**Real Application**\nNow I\u2019m going to walk you through a real example. Total assets and total liabilities can be incredibly complex numbers to try and calculate, thankfully every public company will already have these numbers listed on their balance sheet which can be found on any number of websites. I grabbed Ford\u2019s values from Yahoo Finance for this example. \n\nTo find their book value you will be taking their total assets, which are things the company owns that have value and subtracting their total liabilities, which are things the company owes or is obligated to pay, like debt, interest payments, or workers\u2019 wages. This is then divided by the number of shares in existence. This gives Ford a book value per share of 7.91. This means that for every $13.61 share - Ford has $7.91 of \u201creal\u201d value. Now the last step is to divide the price per share by this number which results in a price to book value of 1.72. \n\nNow before I can go into depth on how to interpret this number I need to explain the different ways to classify assets. Assets come in two forms, tangible, and intangible. This is important to know because it explains why some industries have significantly higher average price to book values than others. Tangible assets are most commonly physical things like factories, land, or machinery. However, they also include two less intuitive items which are cash and investment vehicles like stocks or bonds. The thing that all of these have in common is they have a relatively easy to find real monetary value outside of the company.\n\nThe other category of assets are called intangible assets which are things that are not physical and only have a theorized value. This can include copyrights, brands, or research. These have value but it\u2019s far harder to put a price tag on them. In the standard price to book calculation the two will be added together if the intangible assets are given on the balance sheet. Another reason I defined both is because you will sometimes see people use price to tangible book value which means they did not consider intangible assets in their calculation. \n\n#**How to use P/B**\nWe calculated Ford\u2019s price to book ratio as 1.72. Now like most fundamental ratios this seemingly random number each company has means absolutely nothing without some context. There is no definitive line of what defines a good or bad number because companies can have vastly different amounts of tangible vs intangible assets - and intangible assets are incredibly difficult to price. As with all fundamental ratios, you should only be using them as one of many data points to get an idea of how the business stacks up against similar competitors.\n\nFor example, a consulting firm with a handful of employees and one small office building could generate as much profit as the steel mill on the other side of town. But because the steel mill has a lot more physical assets it\u2019s going to naturally have a much lower price to book ratio. These companies are effectively equal but if you use price to book blindly you won\u2019t see them that way. This means that in order to get the most out of a price to book comparison you want companies that are within the same sector and often even within the same industry.\n\nTo illustrate this point, I calculated the average price to book ratio of all of the sectors over the past few years. The technology sector which relies heavily on intangible assets has an average price to book of 7.3 which is the highest. One interesting thing I found was that even among sectors that are very physical in nature the value varies by *a lot*. Industrials have an average of 4.8 whereas the energy sector has an average of only 1.65. \n\nBut what do these numbers actually mean? The price to book value compares the current valuation of the company, which includes future growth and speculation, to their current value, according to the balance sheet. A price to book of 1.72 means that the stock price is valuing Ford at 72% more than what their current accounting value is. At the very least, this means that large investors have an idea of how much they\u2019d lose if the company went bankrupt and needed to be liquidated. This tie to real value is one reason why value investors prefer low price to book ratios, although as we saw when looking at the sectors, low is relative. \n\nLet\u2019s continue with the ford example and see how it can be used in practice. Let\u2019s compare their 1.72 price to book value to tesla, who is the largest of all up and coming electric vehicle makers. Tesla has a price to book of 26.95 which shows that their price is almost entirely speculative and is incredibly disconnected from their current real value. For reference, the average price to book ratio for the automotive industry is about 4. You can see how Ford and Tesla stack up here. This doesn\u2019t necessarily say that tesla isn\u2019t something to buy, but it does say that it is a growth stock that people expect *a lot* from in the future. If tesla is not able to reach the levels of growth speculated it will appear to be a disappointment to its investors and has a lot farther that it can fall before it reaches a more stable price when compared to something like Ford. If Tesla fails miserably and goes bankrupt the shareholder is unlikely to get back more than a tiny fraction of their money. If ford fails miserably and goes bankrupt a large shareholder could potentially get more than half of their investment back \u2013 though the process of bankruptcy and liquidation is large and complex with varying results. \n\n#**What are the pros and cons of P/B?**\nPrice to book is a complex ratio that has a lot of implications. I\u2019m going to go over a few of the benefits and shortcomings of it. Let\u2019s start with the positives. \n* Price to book can be used on companies that have negative earnings. New companies that aren\u2019t yet profitable are very common and without a positive net income can be difficult to compare to companies that are profitable. Many companies that aren\u2019t profitable are still great businesses as long as they are heading in the right direction. \n* Price to book also offers investors a look into how much of the stocks price is based on real value and how much is based on speculation. This it is incredibly effective at separating growth from value stocks \u2013 so much so that the Russell indices use price to book for half of their decision weight when creating their value ETFs. \nNow let\u2019s look at some of the potential downsides. \n* Price to book does not give any indication of how well a company is using its assets, only that it has them. If you have two companies that both have one million dollars\u2019 worth of machinery and the same price to book ratio, you have no idea which one of those is actually making more money. This emphasizes the idea that you always need to look at a variety of  factors when trying to find good value companies. \n* Another downside is that it also struggles to incorporate intangible assets because they are often incredibly difficult to value. This makes comparisons between more physical and less physical companies nearly useless with this metric. \n* Lastly price to book value can vary from company to company because it relies on how that company does their accounting. This effect is even more pronounced if you try to compare companies from different countries. \n\n#**Does P/B give you any advantage?**\nNow, can price to book value help you outperform the market by identifying undervalued stocks? It depends. The first thing it depends on is what type of company you are looking at. Price to book works far better on businesses that are physically intensive because the land, machinery, and factories all have significant real value. It also works well with banks and other financial institutions because cash, stocks, and bonds are all also considered tangible assets due to their easily identified real value. It does not work well when you are looking at intangible industries. Software companies, consulting firms, and pharmaceutical companies are all examples of highly intangible areas of business. \n\nSo, if you are looking to compare tangible companies from a similar industry - price to book has historically been a fantastic predictor of value. The paper called \u201cvalue vs glamor: a global phenomenon\u201d goes into incredible depth regarding the performance of price to book value. From 1968 to 2008 the 10% companies with the lowest price to book value outperformed the highest 10% by an average of 9.3% annually. This is a massive amount and with this it is pretty clear why many index ETFs use price to book to build their value ETFs. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s not all great news. The paper titled \u201cprice to book\u2019s growing blind spot\u201d which covers up until 2016, shows that the price to book ratio has been losing its edge in the last decade to the point where it has almost no benefit. This is a completely true phenomenon, but I want to explain why it may be misleading. \n\nThe last 10 years have been a part of the strongest bull market in history and this market is being led by primarily technology stocks. If you recall, technology stocks are mostly intangible and therefore are not able to be judged accurately with this metric. It is up to you whether you think this trend will continue. If you do, price to book may not be a metric you want to use. However, if you are looking at the long term and expect the market to return to more historically average conditions then it is likely still an effective measure of finding value. \n\n#**Conclusion**\nThe price to book ratio has certainly earned its fame, at least historically. Aside from the past 15 years the price to book ratio has selected strong value stocks again and again. It\u2019s up to you whether you want to bet for or against the current paradigm of the market which is dominated by intangible technology. This will determine whether or not you should make price to book one of your tools. \n\n###**TLDR:**\nHistorically P/B has been one of the best predictors of value. This trend has nearly completely disappeared in the past 10-20 years. This is likely due to the dominance of tech companies which are incredibly heavy on intangible assets. Ideally it should only be used as one of many data points when selecting a stock and should only be used to compare similar companies in similar industries. \n\n###**Mild subreddit self-promotion:**\nIf you enjoy these kinds of posts I created my own subreddit r/FinancialAnalysis where myself, and eventually others, will be doing this style of research. \n\n#**Papers on the subject**\n* P/E, P/B and P/CF are all strong predictors of value:\n    * https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1289357\n* P/E, EV/EBITDA are good predictors, P/B losing power in recent years:\n    * https://www.osam.com/pdfs/research/_19_Commentary_Price-to-BooksGrowingBlind%20Spot_Nov-2016.pdf\n* P/B is effective at selecting outperforming stocks:\n    * https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341941538_An_Investigation_on_Performance_of_Key_Predictor_Ratios_in_Stock_Selection\n* P/B has the most predictive power of all variables tested\n    * https://doaj.org/article/a27d5be5592a4121a97ee4615f0378a7", "id": "p9zxxc", "created_utc": 1629725689.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|49|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0861128717660904}, {"body": "thanks for the knowledge insert", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.008830323815345764}, {"body": "Thanks for explaining to the apes here.\n\nAny list of tickers with low P/B ratio that you would consider?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "RKT mortgage is the mack daddy of P/B ratio", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.42439770698547363}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5083435773849487}, {"body": "thanks for this writeup, literally the only ratio ive had trouble with lol.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "It\u2019s awesome that people are still seeing this", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Reddit Inc. has banned Seeking Alpha articles sitewide.\n\nTo get around this, please repost your comment/thread with the link removed, and the relevant parts of the article copy and pasted. \n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
