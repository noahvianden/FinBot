{"title": "The Supercycle or A Bubble Waiting to Be Burst?", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ykejs60s6rh71.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7d229508995c3e91e58af30c292ca37a5b08953\n\n \n\nIf you have been around the stock markets since before COVID, what has transpired in the last 18 months or so can be a bit too much to take in. The new pandemic generation of investors hear them say \u201cYou kids don\u2019t know what a real correction is like!\u201d and walk away muttering \u201cboomer!\u201d Well, they\u2019re not wrong, you know.\n\nSPX (The Index for S&P 500) has been consistently making new ATHs (all-time high) one after another at breakneck momentum, leaving most analysts in some degree of disbelief. Surely there has to be a correction at some point? What is driving this mania in the markets? Let\u2019s try and figure this out!\n\n**Inflation - The Fuel for the Fire**\n\nWhen someone with the track record of Michael Burry warns you about an impending crash of huge magnitude, you should take notice. \u201cThe Big Short\u201d, known for shorting the market during the housing crisis of 2008, has warned that catastrophic losses would follow if the prices of meme stocks and crypto currencies were to decline leading to a global economic crisis. There are many others who echo those sentiments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rmhnk3pw6rh71.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b97423f1008de79e1d8967abb0a02d1e005067df\n\n \n\nBurry was warning retail that the hype was all designed to lure the people in before what he called \u201cthe mother of all crashes\u201d in a series of now deleted tweets. His words do have substance. It has in fact become evident with the 100% rally in S&P since the COVID crash in 2020. Meme stocks and social media frenzy can drive the prices of certain stocks multifolds within a matter of days. People are becoming millionaires by investing in doge coins.\n\nAll of this has happened at a time when the economy has struggled across the globe and 2020 was a difficult year for most people professionally. A lot of it can be attributed to the relentless inflows of cash into the US economy by the Federal Reserve.\n\nWhat was designed as a measure to keep the economy going has turned into a vicious inflationary cycle with prices shooting up across the board. While it worked in the short term, rapidly rising levels of inflation are never good in the long term for any participant in the economy \u2013 businesses or individuals.\n\nThe massive stimuli of cash \u2013 more than $5 trillion \u2013 has created inflated valuations of businesses and companies in both the traditional and crypto markets. The crypto markets have in fact already seen a massive correction of over 50% in most currencies in the months of May and June. Many people are calling the on-going rally a relief pump that marks the beginning of a longer bear market.\n\n**How Should a Retailer Approach the Upcoming Months?**\n\nAs most traders would say to you, trend is your friend. Until proven otherwise, the market is in an upwards trend and that should define your approach. However, we are at the levels now where you should start being cautious. Maybe taking partial profits on your gains over the last 18 months wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea. P&L only counts when it is realized.\n\nAlso follow strict risk management and stop losses on all your positions. One must never underestimate the market or overestimate themselves. Your exposure must always be under control and never of the magnitude that it impacts your life.\n\nAs long as your risk is managed, trend is your friend.

{"title": "Seeking feedback on my strategy", "selftext": "I\u2019ve been running this strategy since mid-January, primarily based around covered calls on higher IV stocks. My current holdings are TLRY, FUBO, LCID, and WKHS. My core holdings are TLRY and FUBO, and I\u2019ve sold covered calls on PLTR, AMD, CCIV, WKHS, and OSTK in the past. I\u2019ll let those other stocks get assigned away, but I usually try to hold onto my TLRY and FUBO shares due to the great premiums selling CCs. I usually sell around .3 delta, 1.5 to 2 weeks DTE. I also started occasionally incorporating credit spreads with part of my leftover buying power when I spot a good opportunity. \n\nI\u2019ve been able to collect a little over 10k cumulative net premium since January. I am working with about 20k in capital. These last 2 months I\u2019ve collected 2300 and 2900 in premium, and am on pace to bring in around 2.5k this month. I also use margin for the shares, usually between 5-10k. \n\nI am quite bullish long term on Tilray and Fubo, so I don\u2019t mind holding through the inevitable downswings, as long as I can collect the premium.

Last weeks theme was selling options, and boy did we sell! **$APPS short strangles returned close to 100%, with $BIDU following closely behind netting around 80%. Meme stocks also had muted volatility. I sold an $AMC 34 strangle for $630, and although I closed early, I was given the opportunity to close it out at the end of the week for mere pennies on the dollar. Last but not least, a long strangle on $UPST would\u2019ve netted you a whopping 460% return!** Unfortunately for us, earnings season is slowly coming to a close, meaning the quality of our plays will be diminishing greatly! Those looking to trade this week should proceed with caution, as there isn\u2019t much of an edge to be gained this time round. If you wish to track my trades and try them out for yourself, feel free to check out the community links on my profile! Let\u2019s get into it.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e4dnc6QvdsztXrn41DBf1ycFdfcaP37pdW87wVsypSQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **This week is an awful week to play earnings.** Most companies are low quality, and don\u2019t have historically big moves. Options are also priced properly in most cases, meaning there isn\u2019t much edge to be gained on the buy side or the sell side. It\u2019s literally all just gambling, and as a result I\u2019m probably gonna sit this week out entirely. Pay little attention to the sample plays below, as I\u2019ve only included them for inspiration, and in case anyone sees something I may have missed.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Selling $DNUT puts may prove to be profitable.** Although justified, Krispy Kreme has been on a downtrend since its IPO. $DNUT is literally hemorrhaging money and fundamentally the company is a terrible investment. A couple of years ago they actually went private after defrauding investors, doing shady audit practices, and literally using company money to buy back stores owned by family members of the executive board for FIVE TIMES what they were worth. More info on that [here.](https://www.cfo.com/risk-compliance/2009/03/three-krispy-kreme-ex-execs-settle-sec-charges/) Nowadays, the stock is priced as what it is - a fraudulent, cash burning business. Earnings is priced to fail, and as a result, any semblance of positive news will likely send us going upwards. If you have the balls, selling puts may prove to be profitable. The 15P is going for $0.80 giving you a breakeven of around 5.5%. You can even pickup pennies in front of the steamroller and sell the 12.5P for $0.05, giving you a breakeven of 17%. Everyone is expecting $DNUT to fail, so if we get even a smidge of positive news, we\u2019re going up.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **$CSCO options are inefficiently priced.** This is literally the only pricing inefficiency at the time of writing. Options are pricing a 2% move, while historically Cisco moves around 5%. Given that prices remain the same or get cheaper by earnings, a strangle should net you some nice profits. If you\u2019re poor or want a binary directional play, I\u2019d look to buy puts. $CSCO is at ATHs so we\u2019re probably gonna do the classic \u201cdump after earnings regardless of the outcome\u201c thing that everyone seems to get tricked by. Regardless, at the time of writing, $CSCO strangles give us nice edge.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, there aren\u2019t many trades to run this time round! If I notice anything extra during this week, I\u2019ll look to keep you guys posted on my socials. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nAll in all, pretty awful week for trading. Most tickers are complete garbage, and there\u2019s little edge to be gained among those that aren\u2019t. No shame in sitting this one out! That being said, if you see any appealing plays I\u2019ve missed, feel free to let me know!

The main difference however, is that Ubers float is 1.65billion shares and ubers price is currently 5x the value of Didi globals. Didi also doesn't have a load of law suits they have to constantly fight because Chinese people dont have rights. So didis float is 7x smaller and price is 5x cheaper and Didi actually makes money. \n\nWhenever Uber smashed quarterly EPS we saw a surge in price, Didi has 7x less float and is 5x cheaper meaning the sentiment could surpass Ubers sentiment causing magnified effects of these price surges after earnings. Didis price is also supressed by the short shellers where as ubers is a lot more inflated.\n\n**Will Chinese Stocks rebound?**\n\nshort answer is yes I believe they will as the market always corrects after a crash we saw this at the start of the pandemic when the entire market crashed. **Many Chinese stocks are currently undervalued** following the recent crash and its only a matter of time until they rebound just ask the retards who yolod into alibaba. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**tldr**: Stonks only go up especially IPOs something about an IPO bubble. Buying after market crash = good. Current price is around $8 only $0.80  more than the all time low meaning it literally cant go tits up.
