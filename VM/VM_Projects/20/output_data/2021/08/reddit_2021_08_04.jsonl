(People being too afraid to post loss)", "selftext": "Hey everyone so I\u2019ve seen some systematic discrepancies between the loss and the gain flair. \n\nIn a single given day you could have almost 30 times more gain post than loss post. This obviously doesn\u2019t make much sense because I would almost guarantee that there are more people losing than gaining this sub alone. I don\u2019t usually post gains or losses in the sub Reddit because usually they don\u2019t really matter. You can make 100% gain or lose 90% but if it\u2019s just simple trade it it\u2019s not really interesting to post. Right like if you gain with Apple options than well yeah it\u2019s a gain but it\u2019s not interesting to post really. \n\nBut the reason why I think this is a problem is because people especially new traders have this false sense of always making money. And I don\u2019t know why the The lost porn became so dried because throughout the history of the sub posting your loss was basically an assured popularity and respect because not only did you make a bad trade but you were willing to share that with everybody else. Imagine if  analfarmer2 only ever posted when his spy plays made money. Or how deepfuckingvalues was posting his position a year ago when it was down 50%. \n\nTo me it kind of feels like a lie and also kind of pussy behavior.
