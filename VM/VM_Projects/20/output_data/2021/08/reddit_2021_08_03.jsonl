{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, August 3, 2021v", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 3, 2021**\n\nStocks rose today, reversing from yesterday\u2019s losses and extending the current run of day-to-day volatility. Like I said yesterday, I expect a lot of choppiness moving forward as the market participants continue to balance record corporate earnings and expectations for economic expansion with concerns surrounding the coronavirus Delta variant and inflation. Looking ahead, market participants wait for the July Jobs Report, set to be released on Friday.\n\nConcerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant continue to rise, with Florida now emerging as the US\u2019 new epicenter for the disease. Cases in Florida have jumped dramatically, going from 2432 on July 1 to 38,776 on July 30 and have so far had three consecutive days of record infections. Thankfully, however, despite the surge in cases, the death rate has so far remained stable and relatively low, a sign that the vaccines are very effective at preventing hospitalizations and serious death. \n\nIn the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 78,433 as of July 31, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, it is important to note, despite the surge the 7-day average of deaths is 360, once again according to John Hopkins University. However, it is very important to understand that cases remain highly concentrated in areas with high vaccine hesitancy, among other factors. For example, last week 1 in 3 new COVID infections came from just two states: Texas and Florida, according to the White House. While one always has to understand the risks present in the market, in my humble opinion, I don\u2019t think the Delta variant will weigh too heavily on the US economy as a whole. \n\nAccording to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, \u201cThere is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.\u201d Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.\n\nSo far, 59% of the companies in the S&P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. \n\nHowever, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* General Motors (GM) said it will be closing three of its North American assembly plants next week due to the global shortage in semiconductors.\n* Shares of Tencent (TCEHY) fell 10% after a state-media called video games \"spiritual opium\". This prompted Tencent to say it will limit gaming time for minors and may even ban those under 12 from its platform. Looks like the regulatory crackdown in China continues\u2026\n* After a disappointing IPO, shares of Robinhood (HOOD) gapped up more than 25% today. Stock is now roughly 27% above it\u2019s IPO price of $38 \n* French pharma giant Sanofi bought Translate Bio, a biotech company focused on using mRNA to develop other vaccines and therapeutics. Paul Hudson, Sanofi CEO, said of the acquisition, \u201cTranslate Bio adds an mRNA technology platform and strong capabilities to our research, further advancing our ability to explore the promise of this technology to develop both best-in-class vaccines and therapeutics.\u201d\n* Yesterday, semiconductor company Micron Technology announced it was starting a $0.10 dividend, a great sign that company operations are strong. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Arista Networks (ANET) with a host of target raises.

{"title": "Scaling EV Market Oppurtunity", "selftext": "Cathie was onto something\n\n**The Market Opportunity**\n\nContrary to what many boomers say, electric vehicles are not a \u201ctrend\u201d or a \u201cfad\u201d. It\u2019s very reasonable to expect electric vehicles to account for an overwhelming majority of automotive sales by 2050, because of the Paris Agreement. Nearly every single nation in the world is a member of the Paris Agreement. The goal of it is to limit temperature increase to 1.5\u02da C, and encourages countries to attempt to go carbon neutral by the year 2050.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1fkm26xwt6f71.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=deed313af8cdcb82ef63b328506cb1bb4abdeb61\n\nObviously one of the most significant contributors to carbon emissions are current gas powered cars. This is where electric vehicles come in.\n\nThe largest EV markets as of now are:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/krmqo53vt6f71.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=01a4c8b1039a80ab4ec44a65e2ad42d354ee8b48\n\nJust note that Europe as a whole, sells more EV\u2019s than China.\n\nIn the short term, the best market will be Europe let me explain why.\n\n**Europe\u2019s Market Opportunity**\n\nEurope is one of the most progressive places in the entire world, and they are taking climate change and the Paris agreement incredibly seriously. For example the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, and the Netherlands are planning to ban **ALL** ICE(Internal Combustion Engine) vehicles by 2030, and Norway is going to ban them by 2025. Germany as of now, is granting 11k to people who plan on purchasing EV\u2019s, and many other countries in Europe offer significant financial incentives. For example, France just announced an 8.8 billion dollar package, which offers 12k euros(13.5k dollars) to people purchasing EV\u2019s.\n\nEurope has also passed new emissions standards which states that, \u201cno more than 95g of carbon dioxide/km for passenger cars by 2021.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, overall sales increased by **137% IN EUROPE**. **IN MARCH 2021, EV SALES INCREASED BY 169%**. Also in Norway, currently **18.1%** of vehicles **IN USE are PEV\u2019s(Plug in Electric Vehicles).** Iceland is 5.5% and Sweden is 3.7% in 2020. Which is amazing. Many estimates by analysts say that by 2030 around 30% of all automotive sales will be Electric Vehicles. Personally I think this is incredibly conservative, seeing how serious many European Countries are, I will not be surprised if it reaches %40. The two most important countries will likely be France and Germany. Both countries have already passed multi billion dollar packages as incentives to purchase EV\u2019s, and I think these trends will continue.\n\n**INSANE STATISTIC**\n\n**3 OUT OF 4 SALES IN NORWAY IS AN EV. AND HALF OF ALL SALES IN ICELAND. AND 1 OUT OF 3 SALES IN SWEDEN. IN MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 1 OUT OF 10 SALES ARE ELECTRIC VEHICLES.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0c9vuuwzt6f71.png?width=404&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e0fbad8e8d148e8062fde904c7d93efa824e198\n\nYearly EV growth rate in Europe:\n\nBull estimate: 100% growth in EV sales\n\nINCREDIBLY Very Bull Estimate: 150% growth in EV sales\n\nMy estimate: 100% growth in EV sales\n\nBear estimate 40% growth in EV sales\n\nNote: even the bear estimate is incredibly large\n\n**China\u2019s Market Opportunity**\n\nAs of writing, out of any individual nation, China has the largest electric vehicle market in the world. Though China isn\u2019t as progressive as Europe, their EV market will also have huge growth. Call it good or bad, China\u2019s government has complete authority of the economy. We\u2019ve already seen it before, but with the snap of a finger China can put any law they want into existence. Thankfully for the EV market, China has made many laws pushing the use of EV\u2019s.\n\nFor example, many cities have mandated that many ride hailing cars must be electric vehicles, and the government specifies a certain amount of new license plates go to EV\u2019s.\n\nEstimates show that by 2030, the EV sales will increase by 25% **EACH YEAR.** Bear estimate will be around 20%. China has been incredibly consistent with its growth. Very bull estimate will be 30%. I predict 25% growth in China.\n\n**US Market Opportunity**\n\nArguably by far the least impressive.

{"title": "Discovery Warner Bros Merger \u2013 a play for patient smoothbrains", "selftext": "**Background**\n\nIn May, Discovery announced a deal to merge with AT&T\u2019s Warner Media business \u2013 their goal is to create a streaming powerhouse to compete with Disney and Netflix. The new business will be called \u2018Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019 and the deal is expected to close mid 2022.\n\nBoth businesses saw growth in streaming subscriptions this quarter. Warner Media has 67.5m subs (growth of 6% Q-o-Q) and Discovery has 17m subs (growth of 30% Q-o-Q). That\u2019s a total of 85m subs, with quarterly growth of 8%. I think the combined entity will see further subscription growth, as the value proposition of the combined entity will be far more compelling. I don\u2019t need to tell you how the market will reward such growth (just look at the valuations of Netflix and Disney)\n\n**The Smoothbrain Play**\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery is forecasting FY23 EBITDA of $14b and Free Cash Flow of $8.4b. Discovery stockholders will receive 29% of the combined entity. Discovery\u2019s stock (DISCK) closed at $26.50 last night, giving Discovery a market cap of $13b (there are 3 classes of Discovery stock, but they all rank equal in the merger, so I\u2019m doing my maths on the cheapest class which is DISCK). \n\nAt a $13b valuation for Discovery (which is 29% of the merged entity), \u2018Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019 therefore has a market cap of only $45b. At a market cap of $45b, you\u2019re buying in at a multiple of only 3.2x for FY23 EBITDA and 5.3x for FY23 Free Cash Flow, which is an absolute bargain. In comparison, Netflix trades on a 13x EBITDA multiple. If \u2018Warner Bros. Discovery\u2019 were to also trade at a 13x EBITDA multiple, then a DISCK stock would be worth $106\n\nThe play therefore is to buy into Warner Bros. Discovery via DISCK while the multiples are ridiculously low. I expect the DISCK shares to rerate higher as the transaction gets closer to close\n\nMy position: 22.8 DISCK shares @ $26.31", "id": "oxezbf", "created_utc": 1628030940.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|122|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mpzvt2/stem_inc_due_diligence/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19440323114395142}, {"body": "Makes perfect sense. \nBut I know I won\u2019t buy it, and then, I will regret not buying it.", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19026845693588257}, {"body": "I know nobody looks at the actual product but does anyone use these services that's comparing paramount plus to hbo/discovery?
