Our domestic stocks are rising right now because of retail investor and small professional investor money flooding out of China ADRs. Institutional investors and China bulls appear to be trading out of US-listed Chinese ADRs and into Chinese mainland and Hong Kong listed versions of the same stocks. Since the money exiting China stocks is mostly young retail investor money, it\u2019s mostly going into options trading (which increases volatility), WSB style meme stocks, cryptocurrencies and Big Tech stocks. So the overvalued stuff of the stock market is getting even more overvalued right now. What\u2019s also confusing is the sector churn as the delta variant gives whiplash to cyclical investors who were expecting economic rebound to be sustained. \n\nIMO the US is planning to escalate to direct or indirect (proxy war) military aggressions vs China, which would be consistent with our abrupt, chaotic pullout from Afghanistan and Biden\u2019s actual statements that we need our military out of Afghanistan in order to focus on China. Staring a war is America\u2019s go-to solution for stimulating its production/manufacturing economy and our occupation Afghanistan has leveled out and has played out in that sense.\n\nSince our leaders in the US always put corporate and wealth class interests above all else, our leaders won\u2019t do anything that might puncture the stock market bubble until the investment bankers, leading corporations and/or hedge fund community have figured out a few ways to either reliably profit from the burst or get bailed out at taxpayer expense. \n\nHowever, while our leaders continue to focus on punching China as a way to force liquidity out of China ADRs into US stocks and as an excuse for planning new military aggressions as a way to stimulate our production economy, Europe has emerged as the new threat to US economic hegemony as its growth has stabilized and surged. So we can spend our pandemic flooding the market with liquidity and punching at China to generate quick stock market boosts and military production stimulus, but we have other rivals asserting themselves now. Parts of Latin America which have strategic resource alliances with Europe and China have also been doing well lately.\n\nIn conlusion; European & Latin assets are a good rotation right now. If you buy Chinese stocks, go for stocks listed on the mainland or on Hong Kong exchanges instead of US-listed ADRs. When it comes to US stocks, bubbles probably won\u2019t burst soon, so long as there are manageable ways for our leaders to keep it going. But it\u2019s a good time to start building up cash, crypto and bonds positions as well as to hedge the domestic US stock portfolio.
