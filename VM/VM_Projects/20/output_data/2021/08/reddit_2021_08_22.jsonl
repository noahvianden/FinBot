{"title": "I scanned over 150 charts this weekend. Here are some good setups I found to BTFD (or sell CSPs): DKNG, SNOW, DPZ, PYPL, TSM", "selftext": "# Last Week\u2019s Review\n\nThe SPY and QQQ ended flat last week while IWM and small-caps closed down -1%. The market did not react well to the Fed hinting of a potential taper by the end of 2021 or early 2022. Growth names took a beating, but most of last week\u2019s list performed relatively well being down only 2-3%.\n\nJackson hole Fed meeting, virtually, is taking place this Friday August 28 and will be a big tell in what\u2019s to happen next for the market. They will discuss economic policies that, as we know, rule over the stock market and dictate where valuations should be. If you are an investor this will be a key event to keep an eye on. Due to the meeting I will be trading light this week, but I\u2019ve still put together a few names on my watch-list down below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe market is in a peculiar place. We have:\n\n* Retail sales lower than expected\n* China retail sales lower than expected\n* China stocks still in hot lava\n* Fed saying it\u2019s time to taper\n* Inflation being transitory and also maybe not transitory\n* Covid news flip-flopping daily between good and bad\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is more information than the market can even digest, which is a possible factor for this increase in volatility and choppiness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI want to eventually get into all the details of how I find stocks to choose from. It\u2019s really nothing fancy like boilinger bands or ichimoku clouds, but rather simple technicals such as support and resistance lines, moving averages, and trend channels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere will never be a clear leading indicator of when to buy or sell a stock for max profit. Most of it is knowing about the stock/company and finding a reasonable entry point for it, like we\u2019ve been doing with out \u201cBuy The Dip\u201d charts. Next week I\u2019ll cover some of these charting and technicals a bit more in-depth, but for now I\u2019ll leave you with several questions I ask myself before entering the play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Is the company fundamentally strong? If not, am I playing a bounce or what is my game-plan, aka how long will I hold the position?\n* Is the stock in an up-trend? If yes, is it near the top of the channel, or at the lower trend-line and a decent entry?\n* Is the stock in a down-trend? Has the stock price settled or bottomed? If yes a base might be forming. If not, am I catching this knife because I think the share price over-reacted to bad news? Is the company still trading at ridiculous PE or P/S? Did the company\u2019s moat get threatened? Has growth slowed?\n* Am I trading on stock hype? Has the hype died off and provided a potential entry, AKA my green/orange/red zones? Am I FOMOing into the trade or should I re-visit this stock in 7 days and see if it\u2019s still something I want to buy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are all important questions to ask yourself before you enter any position. Figure out your game-plan and strategy and fine-tune it into something that works for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat do a pizza, gambling, and tech stock have in common? Nothing, but let\u2019s buy the Fing dip.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The MEME List\n\n**DraftKings (DKNG)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8s5zajbrpzi71.png?width=2254&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd20aed890bd535e8de05ed1fdd9dabd3cd27899\n\nDKNG had a great run up to $70 earlier this year, but since then it saw a steady decline, with most other growth stocks, back to the $40 level. Looking at the 50 EMA line it was clear that it was in a downtrend, but it just recently crossed back over. I wouldn't say an uptrend is confirmed just yet, but we are almost there. This may prove to be a good entry and I'm willing to take the risk on this fairly risk-averse play.\n\nThere is potential it could drop back to $45 level, but IMO this could also be a $75 stock. I see 10-20% downside risk with 50% potential upside and that is a risk-reward I prefer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Snowflake (SNOW)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqpiwkyrpzi71.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&s=566d8b20a657abf145c1b299142dfbb6fc1fca5d\n\nThe over-hyped IPO of SNOW that shot the stock up to over $400 per share and eventually into a quick reversal back to the high $200's. I added an orange zone box to show where the stock started to bottom out. SNOW has lost most of it\u2019s volatility that surrounded the IPO and since May has been on a SLOW grind back up. SNOW is down 8% over the last 5-trading sessions and is sitting at the 50 EMA (orange line). I'll be looking for a bounce off this line.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The BTFD List\n\n**Paypal (PYPL)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9y31ffispzi71.png?width=2266&format=png&auto=webp&s=7752d2fdaf2c6cb822a8b90a1684dddea361f93a\n\nPaypal stock dropped recently on earnings after Ebay announced a transition to their own managed payments system. PYPL did post impressive earnings, but had soft guidance for Q4 and the stock tumbled.\n\nUnlike meme stocks PYPL's trends have been steady and consistent. Looking at the chart it just recently dipped below the 50 EMA to potentially form a reversal (but not yet), and is sitting at the 100 EMA where I am looking for a bounce. Should we lose this level I might exit the position as the trend would be confirmed to the downside and potentially $240.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Dominoes Pizza (DPZ)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oouz0k4tpzi71.png?width=2270&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2bf6d69ce71c1c22ac70f6683a482c4b0b41157\n\nLed by international expansions and strong domestic growth Dominoes pizza has been one of the most out-performing stocks of 2021. Similar to PYPL above it has been on an extremely consistent uptrend. The recent 5% dip has given an entry point and IMO any dip to the 50 EMA can also provide an entry. The stock is also hitting some over-sold indicators which would agree with my bias.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Taiwan Semis Manufacturing (TSM)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lv8267stpzi71.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=68bdfd8e676eef73ca3bb7b27f4d2387a1772736\n\nThe semi-shortage has been affecting many industries. With how cyclical production can be analysts are nervous about the over-production and over-supply that might eventually hit. However, I expect chip demand to remain robust for the foreseeable future. TSM was trading in a range for almost 6 months and oversold levels are starting to show, but IMO this is a value play. TSM trading at a much lower PE relative to their competitors of NVDA and AMD, and not getting much love. To be able to buy this name back at almost the same price as 9 months ago is a value entry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat\u2019s the end of this week\u2019s edition! Hope you all are able to take something away from it. For those that are interested in the memes I\u2019ll be bringing some of those back as well.
