{"title": "A look at options in Coinbase", "selftext": "We're only a couple days into Coinbase options but it's interesting to see what they're already saying about the stock.\n\n**The expected move:** How a new listing like COIN will behave in early trading is unknown, but we can look to the options market to see what traders think.\n\nOptions are pricing about a 12% move for the stock (in either direction) by May 21st. With COIN trading near $311, the move corresponds to about $348 for a bullish consensus and $274 for bearish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/auf8fyn8lqu61.png?width=571&format=png&auto=webp&s=f05ce8ace3079819c7a38b1c8dd6891756abc3a3\n\nThe expected move by the end of June is about 20% and by the end of 2021, a little more than 35%. In its brief existence, the stock has had a range of about 30% between its all-time highs ($429, its first day of trading) to its recent lows ($302).\n\nTo directly compare that to another stock, Tesla is pricing about 12% move for May 21st, and about a 17% move for June. Here's a comparison, with expected moves similar early on (TSLA has an upcoming earnings) but COIN diverging a bit a few months out with options pricing in larger moves into the Summer. (chart is a one month view, table below, via Options AI expected move calculator):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vsfk0046lqu61.png?width=645&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c3777e283585443799ed42befb60e4dca7039d5\n\nUpside skew exists in COIN options, but it is not as massive as we saw in the meme stocks a few months ago. But it does mean that debit call spreads that sell upside calls take advantage of that skew. In fact, fairly wide debit call spreads can trade at similar prices to the calls they are selling, essentially selling to the retail order flow driving up those OTM call prices.\n\nFor those looking to sell premium, that also means that bearish Credit Call Spreads have slightly worse IV pricing than Bullish debit call spreads.\n\nWhen buying a debit call spread, the trader is taking advantage of skew, buying a call at a lower volatility than the call they simultaneously sell. Selling bearish credit call spreads are somewhat negatively affected by that skew, selling a call at a slightly lower volatility than they call being bought.\n\nSkew exists to the downside but it is not as pronounced. (In other words retail is pumping up prices in OTM calls more than they are doing to the downside OTM puts.)\n\nAgain, this isn't GME type skew, this is much more like TSLA type skew, but worth keeping an out when buying calls or call spreads. (or selling call spreads).\n\nI've written some more on COIN over on [Learn](https://learn.optionsai.com/what-is-the-options-market-saying-about-coinbase/) with some specific trade examples.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate/Edit: I probably should have included this, the comments reminded me. If one thinks of COIN as somewhat of a proxy for BTC ... BTC options expect/are pricing a little more volatility than COIN stock. BTC is about 17% out to May 28th vs about 14% for COIN.", "id": "mw6945", "created_utc": 1619102457.0, "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "Is there  a sub for $COIN stock talk?", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Not sure?

{"title": "Telos (TLS) DD", "selftext": " **Trash my DD:** This is my first DD, so by all means trash it, give me pointers, degrade me, etc I'm here to learn! I've seen a couple people a few months back lightly cover this company but without details. So, here's my take.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***TELOS***\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is it?** An I.T. and cyber-security company that serves govt and large enterprise clients and focuses on leveraging cloud technology.\n\nEnd of 2020, going into \u201821, Telos switched their focus to product development, scaling, and deliveries. They didn\u2019t have any strong advertising or marketing strategies ending 2020, though they plan to drastically change that this year with a planned *300%* increase on revenue from their 2020 advertising/marketing investments.\n\nTheir biggest product, Xacta, is used by BIG names: ***CIA, DoD, National Archives, Department of Energy, Amazon, and Microsoft.***\n\nTelos has been flying under the radar for the past few years, being used only by people like the CIA, because they\u2019ve wanted to focus on a niche customer-base and provide quality service, building up their business through hard work and a loyal, federal customer base rather than hype-- another reason you won\u2019t find out too much information on them through typical analyst ratings: they\u2019ve had a completely different customer-niche than usual companies. As they begin to spread into commercial organizations, more data will be released for the public to analyze.\n\nNow, as cyber-security becomes increasingly important, institutions are setting standards that security and I.T. companies have to comply with. These organizations outside of federal agencies are constantly seeking help to comply with these new sets of standards which Telos has mastered with their cybersecurity product, Xacta. Telos is the only player in the game with a product like Xacta. All eyes are turning to them for help with complying to these new standards. Roughly 50% of commercial organizations are set to adopt these standards this year, with Telos\u2019 product Xacta. Commercial companies/organizations everywhere are starting to do their research on who can help operationalize these standards and soon beginning to find out that Telos is the top dog in the game for it.   \n\nThe next venture of domination for Telos seems to be the educational sector. Unleash: ***Telos Ghost***. The Ghost product actually aims to completely hide the school\u2019s network and cyber infrastructure from any outside or even internal threats as well as simply unauthorized users. Another goal of Ghost will be to completely prevent cyber bullying and hide the students and their assets, digitally speaking (very interested to see how the prevention of cyber bullying will be implemented into the security framework). Not only will Telos conceal the students and the school\u2019s digital infrastructure with Ghost, working with Telos helps with school audits, making the exhaustive process smoother and within compliance with security standards. As we mentioned before not many products, dareisay\u2026. Any at all\u2026 offer full security to organizations within the new set of security standards. Another factor that Telos has is the wifi networks they offer to educational institutions. It offers massive collaborative capabilities to the students and teachers, helping everyone achieve their goals together on the go with peace of mind of any security breaches on mobile networks. \n\nLooking at Telos as a stock, as of 4/19/21, institutional ownership has risen .1% to 27.6% and insider ownership has risen *16.3%* to 26.6%. They\u2019re closest competitor is CSP Inc. which ended last year on a negative 1.45 million in net revenue, whereas Telos has actually ended 2020 with a net gain of 6.84 million. They only plan to increase their net revenue this year with the marketing and advertising investments they\u2019ve made. The net gain of 6.84 million is up from last year\u2019s negative 2.3 million and up from prior years as a whole, showing healthy signs of growth. Their revenue growth has gone up 20 million consecutively each year the past two years. Towards the end of 2020, Telos also signed a 10 year, 10 Billion dollar plan with TSA and their pre-check system. Coming into 2021, they\u2019ve even managed to go ahead and set up $75 million in deals with customers *so far*. They still have plenty of time to add a couple more deals in. Their revenue for the end of the year is projected to be between 283 million and 295 million, which is over a 50% increase in revenue compared to last fiscal year.  Their earnings are projected to grow over 60% this year-- that\u2019s faster and higher than the u.s. stock market as a whole year to year. The return on equity for the next 3 years is predicted to be almost 30% (29.3%). Telos also has NO debt. The company actually just completed a \u201cFollow-On Offering,\u201d which is a great thing for Telos because all they were doing was simply raising capital shortly after having their IPO-- a completely healthy move, in fact, a very bullish sign (remember, they have no debt, so all it did was give them more money to work with for future projects).\n\n\nEdit1\u2014 positions: 7 shares @ 33.33/share (I plan on amassing more ASAP)\n\nEdit2\u2014 this is not financial advice, I just like the stock and feeling more passionate about them the more I find\n\nEdit3\u2014 my karma is too low atm to reply back to most people\u2019s I was a lurker for a lil while however I plan on changing that\n\nEdit4\u2014 I mentioned a 10 year, $10B plan (I read it wrong, just a multi billion, not a full $10B, thank you to the user that pointed that out to me!)", "id": "mw8jtp", "created_utc": 1619108686.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.52, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Well done.

That is, if their anonymisation actually works...\n\nThey also say that in their [white paper](https://www.telos.com/wp-content/uploads/private/Telos-Ghost-Remote-Access-white-paper.pdf):\n\n>Consumer and private citizen use of VPNs generally centers on publicly available services that improve the confidentiality for web browsing. This approach also carries significant privacy risk, especially when the public VPN provider chooses (or is forced) to enable high levels of activity logging. This can result in citizens who require privacy having their website usage, timestamps, and even entry locations exposed to authorities or hackers.\n\nThis is flawed, enterprises do not use commercial VPN solutions usually, they buy a product and install it in their own network, and the encryption is therefore between the end user and the enterprise network.\n\nThe reason most breaches occur is not because companies do not have the \"right security product\", its because they fail at basic things (i.e: implementing 2FA on external portals, Patching their stuff, etc.) Anyway, I'm not saying this stock will not pick up steam for a while, since companies are thirsty for cybersecurity magic solutions thses days, but I am saying maybe do not bet too hard on that Ghost product.\n\nHowever, I really like their Xacta product. This space truly does not have many offerings for compliance automation (afaik) and it is a big part of cyber, and with more regulations popping up everywhere, it is not going anywhere.\n\nAnyways, just wanted to chime in with some opinion from the cybersec field, I hope this may help in the DD.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

Consumers were increasingly using their mobile devices to access Facebook. Since the screen sizes of mobile devices were small, investors were worried about the monetization potential of Facebook's mobile users. As a result, the stock dipped to below $20 from the highs of $40 plus just after its IPO. Mark Zuckerberg noted that users are spending more time while accessing Facebook on Mobile versus desktop and it should benefit Facebook but investors weren't convinced. Facebook introduced News Feed advertising around the same time which coupled with users spending more time on Facebook resulted in better monetization and higher revenues for Facebook. The moral of the story is if you give consumers what they want and how they want it, it will likely lead to them consuming more of your content resulting in better monetization and higher revenues.\n\nA similar transition is happening at Discovery with its recently launched Discover plus app. For the last several years Discovery was lacking a good OTT or Direct to Consumer (DTC) offering. Many consumers prefer their digital devices to access content rather than linear television. They also like to access the content library at their will to see what interests them at a particular time and not what is being shown on television at that time. Television viewership is in decline and Discovery not having an attractive product for cord-cutters was a big headwind for the company. This changed with discovery plus launch in January this year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Higher Domestic ARPUs**\n\nWhile it is just initial few days, management noted that consumers are already spending more time when they watch content on the Discovery plus app versus linear television. This coupled with the ability to provide more targeted advertising on mobile bodes well for content monetization in the long term. In its December presentation, management noted that the company generated an ARPU of \\~$7 on linear television in the United States. In the U.S. ARPU on Discovery Plus app is matching linear initially on the ad-free offering with a potential to move higher over the next few years. On the ad lite offering the ARPUs are expected to be higher than linear at the launch with further upside potential as the company is able to deliver more targeted advertising.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Much Higher International ARPUs**\n\nThe swing in the international market is expected to be much higher with pricing on the Discovery plus app being 3x to 4x in many of these markets. Discovery's U.S. Networks generated revenues of $6.9 billion and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (Adjusted OIBDA) of $4.0 billion during 2020, while its International Networks generated revenues of $3.7 billion and Adjusted OIBDA of just $723 million in the same period. This despite much higher viewership in international markets. For example, Discovery Channel had approximately 86 million subscribers in the U.S. as of December 31, 2020, while Discovery Channel and the Discovery HD Showcase brand had approximately 277 million cumulative subscribers and viewers in international markets. TLC had approximately 85 million subscribers in the U.S. and 5 million subscribers in Canada that are included in the U.S. Networks segment as of December 31, 2020, while TLC content had approximately 356 million cumulative subscribers and viewers in international markets.\n\nIf the company is able to monetize international subscribers better on the discovery plus app, it can be a game-changer for the company.\n\nInitial Discovery plus pricing is a step in the right direction. The company first experimented with the discovery plus app in India last year. India is an example where Discovery's content is very poorly monetized. For linear TV you can get a discovery subscription starting around INR 8.26 per month or \\~$1.32 per annum. The company's heavily discounted annual discovery plus app subscription for one screen is priced at INR 299 per annum or slightly more than $4 per year which is more than 3x linear. The monthly subscription is currently at INR 99 per month or $1.32 per month (which is equal to the annual subscription they charge on linear TV). Still, it has seen 4.5\\* review on Google Play with most of the consumers loving what they are paying for the content and criticism mostly around technical issues like download feature not available, etc. It is not a meaningful market in terms of economics right now but nonetheless, it illustrates what the company is doing to improve monetization in international markets and they clearly are heading in the right direction.\n\nSo, transitioning from a linear to a digital world is likely to lead to higher ARPUs both in the U.S. and abroad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Lower Breakeven**\n\nOne thing which differentiates Discovery from other players is its leadership position in non-scripted content which has higher margins. The company's library of high-quality owned content gives it a competitive edge in its niche compared to other OTT platforms. This will enable Discovery plus to break even earlier than most of its peers and have better margins than them.\n\nThe math here is simple. In FY2020, the company's next-generation revenues were \\~$850 mn and the net impact of next-generation investments (expense minus revenues) was \\~$500 mn. So, the company's expense on the next-generation initiative was \\~$1,350 mn in FY 2020.\n\nIn Q1 the company's next generation revenues were trending up 50% yoy. If management was using this 50% as the annual revenue growth number (50% of FY2020 revenue (850 mn) = $425 mn incremental revenues in FY2021) while giving guidance for incremental $200 mn to $300 mn in headwinds from next-generation investments, the total incremental expense for next-generation initiatives in FY2021 would likely be in $625 mn (= $425 mn + $200 mn) to $725 mn (= $425 mn + $300 mn) range.\n\nIf we add it to last year's expense of \\~$1,350 mn, we have total expense attributable to next generation initiatives in $1,975 (= $1350 mn + $625 mn) to $2,075 mn (= $1350 mn + $725 mn) range or $2,025 mn at the midpoint for the current year.\n\nIf the company is able to get $7 per month in ARPU, the company can breakeven at \\~24 mn subscribers with this cost structure \\[Calculation: 24 mn users \\* $7 in ARPU per month \\*12 = $2,016 mn in annual revenue vs $2,025 mn expense calculated above\\]. I don't think 24 mn subscribers is that distant a dream given the catalysts like the upcoming Tokyo Olympics and Beijing Winter Olympics, and several new launches scheduled for the back half of this year.\n\nMy calculation above considers management expectations before Discovery plus got solid traction. It is entirely possible that management decides to invest more to accelerate further the solid traction Discovery plus is gaining. They are managing the next-generation business for long-term growth rather than just breakeven. But I won't be surprised if this business starts contributing $1 bn plus to the bottom-line and free cash flow as subscriber count grows to 40 mn plus over the next couple of years.\n\nManagement had initially provided OIBDA margin guidance of discovery plus as at least 20%. However, on its last earnings call and a Deutsche Bank conference in March, CFO indicated that there was a lot of conservatism build in that number. I believe discovery plus can easily see an OIBDA margin in the 30% to 40% range as it scales over the next couple of years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Low Valuation**\n\nBefore Discovery plus launch analysts and investors were characterizing Discovery as a company in secular decline with linear Television subscribers cutting cords and moving to OTT platforms.\n\nThey were skeptical of the company's ability to attract subscribers on its DTC platform and were questioning whether customers will pay for Discovery's content versus the already existing players like Netflix.\n\nThe successful launch of Discovery plus has proved the bear thesis wrong. The company gained \\~7 mn new DTC paid subscribers in January and February. While the skeptics may continue to question whether consumers will use online streaming apps other than Netflix, consumers have already spoken - they are using multiple apps. Netflix's net new users' count fell significantly short of analysts' estimates last quarter while other players gained traction. I believe Netflix is a good company with a significant potential to increase its ARPU, but there is no denying that there will be other providers which will co-exist. This is the same as multiple content providers on linear television.\n\nSkeptics are ignoring Discovery's leadership position in non-scripted content which has higher margins. With Discovery plus, the company has the potential to significantly grow its revenue and profitability in the short, medium, and long term. So, the company deserves a much better valuation.\n\nThe company has generated \\~$3.1 bn in annual free cash flow in FY2019. If we exclude \\~$300 mn of net investments (expense - revenues) in new DTC investments, free cash flow from the legacy linear business was \\~$3.4 bn. Last year, due to Covid-19 related headwinds and \\~$500 mn in DTC investments, the company posted \\~$2.3 bn in free cash flow. Excluding DTC investments, the free cash flow from the legacy business was \\~$2.8 bn. I believe in a normalized environment, it is a reasonable assumption that the company's linear business can generate free cash flow over $3 bn. While this year the company's FCF is likely to be impacted by further investment in DTC given the strong traction discovery plus is gaining, I expect FCF to grow substantially above $3bn in the medium term as it sees better monetization and margins from Discovery plus.\n\nThe company's current market cap is less than $16 bn or \\~5x its legacy linear business free cash flows. This implies investors are expecting the company's business to continue declining and it is failing completely in its DTC strategy. It makes no sense as the company is doing well in terms of its DTC performance.\n\nI believe the company can easily reach $4 bn to $5 bn in free cash flow over the next few years with the pivot to DTC at higher ARPUs adding a billion or two to legacy linear business FCF. If we assign a P/FCF multiple of 10x, the market cap should reach $40 bn to $50 bn versus currently less than $16 bn. So, there is a potential for its stock to triple from the current levels.\n\nClass wise Discovery A shares and C shares are certainly cheap. I am preferring A shares as I am exploring the potential of \"retail activism\" (discussed in the next section) and A shares have voting rights while C shares don't. B shares carry much higher voting rights but are trading at a significant premium. If Discovery plus continues to gain traction, I believe even B shares can go higher but the risk-reward scenario appears much more favorable for A shares.\n\nI don't like to sound like promoting Bill Hwang's bull thesis here but frankly, I believe there is no bear thesis for short selling at this price other than scaring smaller investors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**High Short-Float**\n\nBy now everyone knows about Archegos implosion and how it impacted Viacom and Discovery's stock where the fund had a disproportionately large stake. However, there is more to the story. In addition to Archegos fallout, one of the reasons behind the recent correction in Discovery's share price is heavy shorting by short-sellers post-Archegos fallout.\n\nThe number of shares short for Discovery class A increased 13.43 mn from February 25th to March 30th. As of March 30th 58.98 million of Discovery class A shares were short representing 42.59% of the float. In the same period, 17.84 mn shares of Discovery C class were sold short. A similar attempt to short Discovery B class shares resulted in a short squeeze due to low float.\n\nGiven the initial success of Discovery plus, I don't think there is a fundamental case to short Discovery at these levels. However, we have started seeing articles in media which are trying to portray the company in a negative light. There have also been selective leaks in media which have led to panic among small investors and caused a sharp drop. This seems to be the routine playbook of shorts to scare retail investors.\n\nI believe Discovery A shares can be a good potential target given the high short interest, low valuations, strong cash flow generation profile, and somewhat of a hubris among short-sellers that it is ok to short a company that has incredibly good free cash flows and is successfully pivoting to DTC business which has higher growth potential and better ARPUs. Discovery has an offering that most of the investors themselves use and understand.\n\nThere is a significant risk to short-sellers if smaller investors chose not to panic and hold the stock as the company executes its DTC strategy.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nNOT MY DD, from GS Analytics", "id": "mwhwbs", "created_utc": 1619134332.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you for sharing this DD.

Always has been always will be. Why you ask? Because of the [SHARE CLASS TRADE](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X1000156X) between DISCA/DISCK. This flip-flops every once in a while, but currently DISCK trades at a discount to DISCA and at some point that discount is expected to collapse (a variety of reasons), but in the meantime, a lot of hedge funds buy DISCK and short DISCA as a result in order to realize that spread. This is the same with plenty of share class trades (LBRDK/LBRDA - or any liberty stock for that matter).  \n\n\nSo while the short interest has increased like you said, the base short interest in DISCA isn't really a short thesis and a squeeze won't work on them because if you squeeze DISCA, then DISCK (which they own) goes up so they're losing on one side but winning on the other and its a wash.   \n\n\nIf you look at the holders list for HFs below the top 10 on DISCK (HBK, River Road, DE Shaw...) you can bet a lot of them have that position hedged with shorts in DISCA", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["de"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Slowly moving up to my 5/14 40c.
