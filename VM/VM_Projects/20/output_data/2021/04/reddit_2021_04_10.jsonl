I bought a lot of calls for big tech and recovery for june and july.\n\nAlrighty , well so far with all the news and fed still pumping money (Jpowell hasnt changed what he has said about the recovery being slow and inflation probably not increasing ) the 60 minutes interview he will do this sunday probably wont do anything just like the last 2 meetings so far. This is because he is just repeating exactly what he has said , he hasnt seen progress in employment for people of color and women and until that is up he wont stop with what he is doing . Unless there is massive inflation which so far he doesnt think will happen.\n\nFurthermore after the 60  mins, the only other time he will speak is at the end of april (Ill get back to this later on).\n\nI also think after that correction/ hedge fund rotations, they priced in inflation already.\n\nCatalysts -\n\nTech companies started rallying, as earnings reports are about to come in and the sentiment so far is that they will crush expected results .\n\nBond yields are not reaching those 1.75 highs , infact they have been dipping so far as investors are choosing  american bonds over other countries . (You buy american bonds , bond yield goes down) This is due to us bringing down our covid cases and increasing our vaccination numbers compared to europe and other countries.\n\nAs vaccination numbers increase and covid numbers decrease , a lot of betts are being made that a lot of these mask mandates and etc will possibly be removed by summer (this is a extremely early date , a lot of people are betting end of summer and mid fall). This will cause recovery stocks to perform well, and will have a lot of people returning to work which brings me to another point.\n\nEnd of most of these supply shortages  which will cause inflation in the price of certain items to decrease . There are a lot of items that are facing inflation due to shortages in supply.\n\nBidens economic plan that will pass this summer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOverall , its still bullish and wont change any time soon , yes there will be pull backs but for how long? 1 week? 2 weeks?

Also to the bears, theres going to be small pullbacks throughout the year , pretty sure September will hit like a mfker. Also i personally dont see a bear market possibility for this year unless inflation or some random bullshit happens . To be honest i dont see a bear market until probably fall of 2022 at the earliest .

{"title": "MAXR DD", "selftext": "Overview\n\nMAXR or Maxar technologies is a space technology solutions firm. They specialize in satellite imagery, and provide services to NASA and the department of defense including robotics, earth imagery, and geospatial analytics and insight. This company has a long history working with NASA, in 1965 it was known as 'philco-ford', and designed and developed the Houston space center for the gemini and apollo missions. Since helping humans reach the moon for the first time, the firm has gone through a number of acquisitions, and acquired multiple other companies itself. Today MAXR has 4 satellites orbiting earth, which they use for their primary business which is imagery. 60% of their business is satellite imagery services, and 40% is space infrastructure. \n\nWhat do they do with their satellites?\n\nMAXR uses satellite imagery to assist the various branches of the military. The company uses satellite imagery to locate mission critical locations of enemy warships, airbases, communications systems, and other physical infrastructure that the military might need to form a tactical plan.  MAXR is a key partner in us army's project TITAN, USDI's MAVEN, and NAVY's project Overmatch. The most exciting (imo) technology MAXR offers involves using geospatial data to identify the locations of individual shooters on the battlefield. Pretty crazy, but the company can use satellites to capture images of the battlefield, and provide imagery to soldiers on the ground that pinpoint locations of enemy footsoldiers. The companies AI can even recommend actions to take against the located individuals. \n\nIn the infrastructure business, MAXR has recently delivered NASA a space bus for mission psyche that will be travelling to a resource rich asteroid between mars and Jupiter. As well as developing robotic arms for nasa's OSAM-1 mission. Whose goal is to service and repair satellites in orbit. (as a vast majority of satellites are non operational). Satellite repair and reconstruction could be a hugely profitable enterprise, as it would save costs on launching.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBullish arguments\n\n1. Fundamentals. Fundamentally speaking, MAXR technologies is a very attractively priced company. The firm has generated revenue of 1.7 billion in the trailing 12 months, with a gross profit margin of 730 million, or 42%. Compare that 730 in gm to the companies market cap of 2.76 billion and you realize the firm is very undervalued. 2.7billion$ market cap/730 million annual gm=3.69 market cap/profit. Which is quite low. (to put in context aapl=19, pltr=65, ktos=16, mcd=17, amzn=18, intc=6). This essentially means that if you bought the entire business, you'd make your money back on just the profits in under 4 years. \n2. Extremely difficult industry to enter, so threat of new competitors is very low. \n3. Much of the firms business is with multi year, government contracts. So business is locked down for a while. This could be a downside if the company loses a major contract however. \n4. Highly innovative company in a high growth sector. MAXR is the global leader in satellite imagery, No other company has nearly as many, or as important contracts with nasa and various defense agencies. Even Northrup-Grumman and Boeing aren't even close to MAXR when it comes to earth imagery services and advanced robotics engineering. \n5. Strong record of delivering net income available to common stock holders. (A lot of companies don't do this). \n6. Insider/institutional ownership. The firm is owned 66% by institutions, and recently awarded it's insiders 122,000 shares of stock options.\n7. Technical analysis. The company is currently on a dip, after having found resistance around 41$ for months, before the stock offering.\n\nBearish arguments\n\n1. Debt positions. The company has a large amount of debt. With over 2.5 billion of long term debt.\n2. Recent dilution via stock offering. The company recently financed their debt by selling 400m of stock.\n3. shrinking receivables. Accounts receivable are lower this year than any time in the past few years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ndisclaimer: I'm holding calls on this company. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me know what y'all think.
