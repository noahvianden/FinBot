{"title": "TDAmeritrade Margin Sell Out Scare", "selftext": "Yesterday, I did something stupid. I fought a Margin sell out. One may ask... How? Well, I had 3 Vertical Call Credit Spreads for $SPY that I bought towards the end of the trading day looking to make a quick buck. Within 5 minutes I got closed out by TDAmeritrades Margin Sell Out team at 3:02 PM CST. I decided to be a jackass and by the same 3 vertical spreads, because there was still money to be squeezed. MSO closed be out again at 3:12 PM CST. I then decided to further be a jackass and purchase the same 3 vertical spreads at 3:14 PM CST, one minute before options market closed. \n\nWell, both strikes from the 3 Vertical Call Credit Spreads were out of the money, so I thought I made a quick 30 bucks. Then, 25 minutes later the 418 Short leg says ITM, and within 8 - 10 minutes I receive a phone call from, Anthony. I love you Anthony, sorry for being a pain in the ass.\n\nAnthony asks \u201cIs this xxxxxx?\u201d I respond \u201cYes\u201d. He gets down to business, without even delaying and says \u201cDid you repurchase 3 vertical spreads I sold for you?\u201d I say \u201cYes\u201d. He proceed to get angry and says \u201cWhy would you do that?! You now owe $125,500, because you messed up. You were chasing a few dollars and for $10 you now owe $125,500.\u201d \n\nAt this point I am low key about to have a heart attack, because he was super angry on the phone. He proceed to say \u201cDo you have a $125,000 for this?\u201d I then begin to mutter... No. He yells once again \u201cWhy would you do such a thing? Your short leg is ITM, and your long leg expired worthless, so you are uncovered as of now, and whatever spreads I sold earlier you rebought them.\u201d At this point, Anthony, certainly scared me that I owe $125,000 \ud83d\ude05. He then says, Can you transfer in $125,000. I then mentioned that I have a Fidelity account with $150,000, so I might be able to wire transfer to TD. He then begins to cool down and says \u201cI don\u2019t have time for this. I am purchasing half of what you owe $125,000.\u201d Make sure you put all that money into your account tomorrow, or the next day or whatever.\n\nI then tell him. \u201cThank you for explaining everything to me.\u201d I look forward to your call tomorrow. He straight up said in a cocky attitude \u201cNo, you call us\u201d. I don\u2019t blame him \ud83e\udd23.\n\nAnyway, I called TDA like 4-5 times scared to death that I owe them a full $125,000, but apparently, since I had 3 contracts. My risk is 300 shares x however much about or below they are from the exercise price, so in this case $418.\n\nI\u2019m happy that this interaction happen, because he low key traumatized me, due to the lack of my knowledge. I mean, what if it was any other volatile stock that wasn\u2019t $SPY, and I ended up in a more messed up situation? This was certainly a wake up call. I can\u2019t tell if he got into character when scaring me, but i\u2019m going to call him later today and thank him, because this consumed me the whole day today, because I didn\u2019t know what would happen and he was sure to make it seem like I lost $125,000. Not the greatest idea...\n\nOne thing I didn\u2019t like is he made me think I lost $125,000. I mean, I was mentally strong to handle that, but what if someone wasn\u2019t as strong and killed themselves, while he may or may not been having fun by making them think otherwise? What\u2019s your take? I\u2019m going to chat with him about that tomorrow. I appreciate how he busted my balls and scared me, but I don\u2019t think everyone else will process it the same...", "id": "n0yj21", "created_utc": 1619678269.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "/u/irbaz, you do not want to piss off the market sell off team because they could decide to close or limit your account because of your shenanigans.
