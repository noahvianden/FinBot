{"title": "The Copper Bull Market Thesis Is Taking Shape! A Multi-Year Run For The Equities Is Inevitable! I Believe One Company, Torq Resources, Is Best-Positioned to Outperform", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nWith so many exciting developments of late, I wanted to share my .02 on the current state of the copper market, while focussing on one company,\u00a0Torq\u00a0Resources,\u00a0that I believe is extremely well-positioned to outperform in the current market.\u00a0As always,\u00a0any and all feedback is greatly appreciated!  \n\nGenerally speaking, I am looking at this as a\u00a0macro investment based on the supply and demand dynamics of the market.\n\n**On the demand side**\\-\u00a0\u00a0Combination of global\u00a0infrastructure rebuild with clean energy focus has created a\u00a0massive demand for electric vehicles. With each EV requiring 4x more copper than gasoline-powered cars (\\~180 pounds of copper in\u00a0*each*\u00a0EV) and an estimated 125 million EVs on the road by 2030, the demand for copper will steadily increase each year as\u00a0passenger internal combustion engine vehicles are gradually phased out of production. (1)(2) Additionally, EV\u00a0charging stations will require \\~250% more copper by 2030 to meet those demands. (3)\n\n**On the supply side**\\- Covid has forced Copper miners to drastically cut back on operations. What was supposed to be a year of mined supply growth turned out to be the second consecutive year of zero growth.(7)\u00a0 The gap in copper production, coupled with strong EV demand during the post-pandemic recovery has triggered a major supply problem.\u00a0Consequently, analysts from several companies have\u00a0forecasted huge copper price increases (i.e., Citigroup; $12,000 by 2022, Goldman Sachs; $10,500 over the next 12 months, and Trafigura Group, $15,000 over the next decade). (4)(5)\u00a0\n\nAs new mines take years to come on line (due to finding, permitting, developing, exporting, etc), this results in a relatively small number of companies that actually produce copper\u00a0or have the potential to produce\u00a0copper\u00a0in the current cycle.\u00a0\n\nBased on my research, I believe one company is extremely well-positioned to capitalize during this copper bull market.\u00a0\n\n**What is Torq\u00a0Resources?**\u00a0(TSXV: TORQ) (OTC: TRBMF)\n\nTorq Resources is a copper-gold exploration company focused on prolific mining regions in Chile.\u00a0Chile produces more than a quarter of the world\u2019s copper, having produced \\~5.6 million metric tons of copper from mines in 2019. (6) Torq's management team is extremely well-respected within the industry, having raised over $550 million and monetized successes in two previous exploration companies.\u00a0\n\n**Why I Am So Bullish On Torq Resources**\n\nAt a very high level. when I am evaluating junior miners, I start my analysis by segmenting into two categories:  \n\n\n1. Those that reasonably could produce copper at some point\n2. Those that probably will not produce\n\nOf all the Junior explorers I have researched, I expect Torq to have the most success.\u00a0  \n\nThe biggest catalyst for this success is the launch of the Margarita Iron-Oxide-Copper-Gold (IOCG) project located in northern Chile. This region in northern Chile is well-known for its\u00a0discovery potential - and, this particular property that Torq acquired has generated considerable excitement from geologists as having huge deposit\u00a0potential due to the strength of the alteration system, large-scale magnetic targets and the presence of copper oxide mineralization along the southwest flanks. (7)  \n\n\nTorq is set to begin drilling at Margarita in Q3 2021 and the early indicators could not be more positive.\u00a0\n\n  \n**Torq Resources Is Technically Attractive**\n\n  \nAdditionally, from a technical analysis standpoint, Torq Resources is extremely strong.\u00a0\n\nSince hitting its low of 30 cents in early 2020, Torq's\u00a0stock price exploded to \\~80 cents. I suspect it\u00a0will break above double top resistance and rocket to new highs, particularly as the copper supply-demand narrative continues to gain traction in 2021.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o8wp0ffmwit61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=239de7901864662ce7ec06baf0d8ff5da5ed4adc\n\nAs I said at the outset, I\u00a0would be very interested to hear where folks agree/disagree, both as it pertains to the copper market in general, as well as if they too see the huge upside in Torq Resources as I do.\u00a0\n\nAdditionally, for those similarly interested in Torq Resources, I would\u00a0***highly***\u00a0encourage you to check\u00a0out the below website for additional research relating to the company and all of its current initiatives.\u00a0\n\n[https://metalsresearchreport.com/goldman-sachs-copper-deficit-warning/](https://metalsresearchreport.com/goldman-sachs-copper-deficit-warning/)\n\nLook forward to the feedback!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nSource 1:\u00a0[https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/electric-vehicles-will-grow-from-3-million-to-125-million-by-2030-iea.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/30/electric-vehicles-will-grow-from-3-million-to-125-million-by-2030-iea.html)\n\nSource 2:\u00a0[https://sustainablecopper.org/best-practice-indicator/energy/](https://sustainablecopper.org/best-practice-indicator/energy/)\n\nSource 3:\u00a0[https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/electric-vehicle-charging-stations-coppery-2030/](https://www.nsenergybusiness.com/news/electric-vehicle-charging-stations-coppery-2030/)\n\nSource 4:\u00a0[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/trafigura-sees-green-copper-supercycle-driving-prices-to-15-000](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/trafigura-sees-green-copper-supercycle-driving-prices-to-15-000)\n\nSource 5:\u00a0[https://oilprice.com/Metals/Commodities/Goldman-Sachs-Historic-Copper-Shortage-Loom-As-Prices-Rocket.html](https://oilprice.com/Metals/Commodities/Goldman-Sachs-Historic-Copper-Shortage-Loom-As-Prices-Rocket.html)\n\nSource 6:\u00a0[https://www.statista.com/statistics/574483/copper-reserves-of-chile/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/574483/copper-reserves-of-chile/)\n\nSource 7:\u00a0[https://www.torqresources.com/news-media/news/2021/torq-options-margarita-iron-oxide-copper-gold-project-in-chile/](https://www.torqresources.com/news-media/news/2021/torq-options-margarita-iron-oxide-copper-gold-project-in-chile/)", "id": "ms1iui", "created_utc": 1618573916.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "I've been looking to diversify into metals.
