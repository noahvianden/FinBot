Some of it is really just our markets being designed to be untransparent - a trader looks at a chart which does not show the significant off-exchange volume that traded that day that would otherwise change their OBV or MFI or Chaikin technical indicators, is that really manipulation?\n\nMarket makers have to do things to manage their inventory of shares and make a profit so they have various tactics to get orders filled at favorable spreads. Iceberg orders, flashing orders to make you think there's demand or a dump is coming. This is like the intraday, petty level stuff that everyone has to deal with to get their orders executed on anything but blue chips.\n\nA separate group of different manipulators are the companies themselves and funds. They can legally directly short their own stock. The conditions that allow a fund to short a stock they own are set under Regulation M and Rule 105 and you can read this in the sec filings. The idea is they can naked short to keep the price 'stable', and the legal framing the SEC uses to allow the manipulation is for 'stabilization'... against manipulation lol.\n\nSo what if there are no shares available to borrow? Retail and long institutions simply don't have enough shares left or are unwilling to loan out more to short. Well they can still short it by using derivatives like total return swaps that puts the market maker short or long, and to hedge it properly, they will have to maintain delta neutrality. They can hypothecate naked shares to do this.\n\nThe same thing can be done with options. The company releases a PR saying \"We \\[the CEO + directors\\] will purchase on the open market $10M with our personal funds between this date and this date.\" To demonstrate their belief in the company. There's a good chance you've seen that, or you will at some point.\n\nNow, why would they just give retail a braindead opportunity to frontrun them for months and print money for free, and make their own personal purchases they've committed to extremely expensive? No. They go to an investment bank behind the scenes and open a long put position that the options market makers write (that makes them short puts, ie a bullish position), and again, to hedge, the MM adopts an offsetting short position in the underlying. Because they used a proxy, the company does not have to disclose that position.\n\nThe next day, a dead part of the options chain at a weird strike and expiry with formerly zero open interest, completely illiquid, now has 15,000 puts in open interest. This scares off the retailers who'd otherwise frontrun them and paperhands out the people already in who are now sitting on immediate losses to get a cheap transfer of the stocks. The puts either expire or are closed at a profit and the stock takes off now that the management has completed their purchases.\n\nAnd if those aren't enough options, you can use futures contracts too. This was a huge famous case, Credit Suisse used them to manipulate the Volatility ETF/ETN thing a few years back. \n\nThe counterparty's hedging is 100% a real thing, if they want to neutralize their exposure to movement in the underlying.", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03295919671654701}, {"body": "I was wondering, in selloffs like in crypto today, do private investors put stop losses?

An annual run rate of over 600,000. Shanghai production numbers doubled from January to September from 25,000. That's 100% over eight months. I'm assuming 50% growth over the next eight months and 50% growth over the following eight months (much slower than the current growth rate) and averaging it out to roughly 75,000 per month next year. That would give Shanhai a total production of 900,000 in 2022.\n\nFreemont produced and delivered about 450,000 vehicles over the last year despite a stated production capacity of 600,000 cars. I am attributing that drag to the S&X ramp and parts shortages. Elon said they aim to grow Freemonth capacity by 50% over the next two years. That would bring Freemont to 900,000 total over that period. So between the planned capacity improvements, S&X is ramping up, and a softening of parts shortages - I'm estimating that Freemont will produce 600,000 vehicles in 2022. This is equal to their current production capacity and assumes the increased capacity won't be fully realized over the next year to account for any challenges that might come up.\n\nThat brings Shanghai and Freemont to 1.5 million vehicles.\n\nFor Berlin and Austin, I am comparing it to the Shanghai ramp, which produced about 140,000 vehicles in its first year. China is super fast, so I am discounting for that, and there is a lot of new technology going into these new production lines - Zach said this could cause delays. On the flip side, these new factories have learned from Shanghai. They will be using the latest processes, efficiencies, and automation, and they are scaling toward a higher eventual total output. So if I assign Shanghai numbers to both Texas and Berlin - that makes 280,000 production. I discount that a bit for any drag with the new lines and take 80,000 from that total number, and that leaves us with 200,000 production between those two factories next year.\n\nThat results in a total 2022 production (and deliveries because demand is through the roof) of 1.7 Million vehicles.\n\nTL/DR: 900,000 Shanghai, 600,000 Freemont, 100,000 Berlin, 100,000 Austin.

{"title": "The effect of Elon\u2019s expiring options on TSLA (Part 3)", "selftext": "TL;DR TSLA go down then go up. As of Nov 15, Elon is at 33% progress of his Twitter sell-off goal. TSLA lost 17% of its market cap since I published Part 1 of my thesis.\n\n[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnhy0t/the_effect_of_elons_expiring_options_on_tsla/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrhl5o/the_effect_of_elons_expiring_options_on_tsla_part/).\n\nFrom the recent SEC filings I updated the 2012 Award package exercise progress ^((1) (2)).\n\n[ Table 1 2012-granted and vested option exercise](https://preview.redd.it/9bm8fkxp8yz71.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e5d126a1241014ec7ece366f8efa16252ec4dc2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Table 2  Elon\u2019s share transactions \\(negative denotes sell\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/itedsvd39yz71.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8d69815ee06ab701ead2ea7f592937ee9d1b75e)\n\nTotal sell-off progress towards Twitter goal: 33.16%.\n\nInteresting tidbit: Elon sold the exact same number of shares yesterday as a week ago. Maybe today will be another Power Bottom Tuesday?\n\nIt seems that the trade plan from Sep 14, 2021 ^((3)) calls for \\~10% of the 2012 options exercised every week, which projects an exercise progress of 80% by the end of the year. However, Elon seems to be well ahead of the exercise progress with the share sell-off. By this rate, he will reach his Twitter sell-off goal by Dec 4. By then, I expect TSLA to have lost 30% of its market cap from the last closing price before Elon's tweet: $1222.09-30%=$855.\n\nHoldings: Short 2 TSLA, long 1 TSLA Feb18'22 1020P.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n1.
