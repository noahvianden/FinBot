So, at this point ***$YPF is trading below x1 MARKETCAP/EBITDA***\n\n***YPF is also trading at P/BV of x0,2***... Yes 0,2. Im not joking or making a typing mistake\n\nOnly his tower in one of the most wealthy  neighborhoods of Buenos Aires (Puerto Madero) is worth 25% of his market cap \n\n \n\nBut for me the real catalyst for YPF is that once elections finish (14th November), Government will authorize an increase on gas prices (which are very low as a populist measure). They are holding it to retain as votes as possible.\n\nArgentina is already dealing with IMF for a debt restructuring. I'm very confident that they will reach an agreement, but I don't know if it will happen in the short term\n\nIn summary:\n\n* CEO broke quiet period and slide some insides about next ER (will present 10 November)\n* Government will increase oil and gas prices soon\n* Ridiculously cheap from a fundamental/financial side.\n* IMF negotiations\n\nTechnical Analysis (looking great too)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oxr0usfvqdx71.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=9054deb88a966b4d97cf3c7f75f4c4b441f9daa5\n\n \n\nIf Oil doesnt crash, YPF can easily go to 7,25.

{"title": "Gaining Visibility on Paysafe (PSFE) Parts 5-7", "selftext": "Here are Parts 5 - 7 of an article addressing the main bear arguments on Paysafe. Parts 1- 4 covered Paysafe\u2019s outlook on growth, debt, and profit as well as available float.  I recommend starting with the [introduction in Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qkg3i5/gaining_visibility_on_paysafe_psfe/) (Growth), and following the links from there if still interested.\n\n# 5. Blackstone Group\n\nMany have blamed PSFE\u2019s price decline on insider selling by pointing to Blackstone Group\u2019s most recent 13F filings indicating a 23% reduction of their position. However, cross-referencing that 13F and the most recent [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000156459021050428/psfe-424b3.htm) with Paysafe\u2019s March 31 20F ([p.124](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521104105/d159702d20f.htm#toc)) shows that Blackstone holds the exact same number of shares as they did at the time of merger: 123.7 million shares.\n\nIt\u2019s true, private equity lockups expired months ago and the 13F appears to show a sale of 37 million shares between Q1 and Q2.  BUT, to believe that they sold those shares then you\u2019d also have to believe that they BOUGHT 37 million shares (a half billion dollar stake) in Q1, PRIOR to their payout from merger, and then immediately turned around and sold that exact same amount of shares for a SIGNIFICANT loss, just after merger. Seems like quite a stretch. When asked directly about Blackstone\u2019s 13F and whether they\u2019d sold shares, Paysafe\u2019s investor relations responded, \"That swing in the 13F position was an issue with the 13F filing, but I see how that was confusing. \u00a0It was not reflective of any actual open market selling of Paysafe stock.\"\n\nMake of it what you will, but there\u2019s no denying that the most recent records show that Blackstone still holds the same number of shares as they did per the original deal structure. The same is true of CVC.\n\nOther factors to consider about Blackstone\u2019s stake:\n\n* Bears commonly claim Paysafe is overvalued because private equity made 3x on this investment. They reach this conclusion by ignoring the difference between market cap and enterprise value and by assuming PE was somehow awarded a full $9 billion from a $3 billion investment.  In truth, as Reuters [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP), Paysafe, \u201cwas taken private by Blackstone Group Inc and CVC Capital Partners in 2017 for $4.7 billion, inclusive of debt.\u201d At the time of the 2021 merger, Blackstone/CVC received $2.3 billion in cash and $2.8 billion in shares. (280 million shares now worth $2.2b). At current levels, that\u2019s a total of $4.5 billion in cash and shares. So, from their initial $3.9 billion USD (\u00a32.96b) investment, Blackstone and CVC are currently up a mere 15%, between cash and shares. That\u2019s after 4 years of significant strategic investment in restructuring, de-risking, replacing the Board of Directors and bringing in all new leadership (CEO, CFO, CTO, CRO, CIO, CISO etc.).\n* This is part of a long term strategy. When taking Paysafe private, Blackstone/CVC [paid](https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/30924/blackstonecvc-agree-296-billion-deal-for-paysafe) \u201ca 42% premium over the group's average value over the past year,\u201d because, as Reuter\u2019s [reported](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-paysafe-group-m-a/paysafe-backs-3-9-billion-offer-from-blackstone-cvc-group-idUSKBN1AK0KN), insiders close to the deal said private equity had \u201ca decade-long thesis that the shift to \\[digital payments\\] will only grow and grow and they want to get in now.\u201d This \u201cdecade-long\u201d thesis matches Blackstone\u2019s typical investment term of \u201cupwards of 7-10 years\u201d according to their published [white paper](https://pws.blackstone.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/09/the_life_cycle_of_private_equity_insights.pdf). 7 to 10 years would be 2024-2027, which lines up with the FTAC board investment thesis, as outlined in their [proxy statement](https://pdf.secdatabase.com/2681/0001193125-21-060961.pdf) when approving the business combination (see #9).\n* More recently, Reuters [reported](https://cn.reuters.com/article/instant-article/idINKBN28H1GP): \u201cMartin Brand, senior managing director at Blackstone, said in an interview that retaining the majority of its investment would allow the buyout firm to benefit from the expected strong performance that Paysafe will generate going forward.\u201d Blackstone Senior Managing Director Eli Nagler said, \u201cWe believe Paysafe has a long runway for further growth and look forward to remaining part of the team and seeing their continued success as a public company.\u201d\n* And last month, CEO Philip McHugh [assured](https://bmo.qumucloud.com/view/2021-digitalbanking-paysafe#/): \u201cYou won\u2019t see Blackstone and CVC going out there and doing big block sales any time soon. They see our story. They see the pipeline. They see the kind of top of funnel pipeline at the company where we\u2019re gaining traction not only in US iGaming but in \\[digital currency\\], in travel and online gaming.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 6. Insider Ownership\n\nBears have argued that lack of insider ownership is a red flag but on top of the large stake held by board members, Blackstone and CVC, Paysafe\u2019s [share registration](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000156459021050428/psfe-424b3.htm) confirms this argument is another non-starter:\n\n* CEO Philip McHugh owns 2.4m shares\n* COO Danny Chazonoff owns 2.2m shares\n* Vice Chairman Joel Leonoff owns 8.3m shares\n* Chairman of the Board Bill Foley owns 42m shares\n* 3 Employee Trusts own 2.3m shares\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 7. Competition\n\nBears like to claim that a large competitor will eat Paysafe\u2019s lunch, but it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that Paysafe is the one now encroaching on the North American market. Along with expanding in iGaming, they\u2019re initiating their US launch of digital wallets Skrill and Neteller, with higher limits and [real-time pay-in/pay-out](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/skrill-usa-enhances-digital-wallet-080000953.html), which they say \u201cfills a gap in the U.S. market.\u201d\n\nSome theorize that Paysafe\u2019s competitive threat is the reason it\u2019s being shorted, so as to inhibit the company\u2019s ability to raise capital for further acquisitions, or to prime them for a buyout. But the company has leverage to spare and, when asked directly about a buyout, the CEO was very clear that they are not interested.\n\nSpeculation aside, bears who claim Paysafe will lose to competitors generally ignore how large, established, specialized and diversified Paysafe is in the global marketplace. With its focus on niche verticals, Paysafe is the undisputed leader in iGaming; it owns the second largest digital wallet in the world; it is #4 globally in integrated payment processing; it does over $100 billion in volume; it is used in 120 countries, and it is so good at multi-jurisdictional regulatory monitoring and risk management that other payment processors often use them as a middle man for transactions.\n\nThis last point is a key differentiator for Paysafe. CEO McHugh: \u201cBecause it\u2019s complicated, the risk and regulatory management in payments and gaming at a global scale is not something that\u2019s easy to copy.\u201d He further notes, \u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem.\u201d\n\nPaysafe\u2019s regulatory expertise enables them to innovate and enhance their moat with new risk-management solutions in different industries like their recently developed travel safeguarding [model](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Safeguarding-the-future-of-travel.pdf). It\u2019s also a major reason why most iGaming operators use Paysafe\u2019s [award winning](https://www.yogonet.com/international/noticias/2021/05/31/57794-paysafe-wins-payments-provider-award) platform (which, like any good pick and shovel play, makes them immune to the lack of brand loyalty among sports bettors who tend to migrate between iGaming operators).\n\nOften embedded behind the scenes so that customers don\u2019t know they are using it, Paysafe offers a trusted payment gateway that so effectively mitigates transaction liability that it is commonly used as a hidden partner. They work with [MasterCard](https://www.mastercard.com/news/europe/en-uk/newsroom/press-releases/en-gb/2020/march/paysafe-and-mastercard-extend-strategic-partnership/), Visa, Fiserv, [WorldPay](https://www.infinicept.com/payment-facilitator/archive/game-on-for-worldpay-and-paysafe/)(US DraftKings), [Apple Pay](https://www.paysafe.com/us-en/apple-pay/), [Google Pay](https://www.paysafe.com/us-en/google-pay/), [PayPal](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/paysafe-payments-api/payments-api/payment-methods/paypal/), [Sightline](https://developer.paysafe.com/en/rest-apis/paysafe-payments-api/payments-api/payment-methods/sightline/), REPAY, Intellipay, and a host of others. Paysafe is also behind the roll-out of the [award](https://www.paysafe.com/de-en/paysafegroup/news/detail/paysafe-wins-two-payments-awards/) winning [Coinbase/Visa](https://www.thepower50.com/paysafe-issues-coinbases-new-visa-debit-card-enabling-easier-cryptocurrency-spending/) card.  In most cases it would take years of significant investment for others to match Paysafe\u2019s level of monitoring, risk management and underwriting.  It\u2019s often easier for a \"competitor\" to just give them a cut of the take.  CEO McHugh notes, \u201cThat\u2019s where we get broader and deeper take rates over time. We process with Worldpay and have a capability with Fiserv as well, so we do multi-processor there.\u201d  And Danny Chazonoff, COO, adds, \u201cIn Europe, we are the acquirer of record, so we have a principal membership with Visa and MasterCard. What that brings for us is the ability to do our own underwriting without any intervention at all from an acquiring bank.\u201d\n\nRather than competing directly with other payment processors, Paysafe's angle is to quietly work with everyone.  This is partly why Bill Foley describes Paysafe as \u201cubiquitous. It\u2019s just everywhere.\u201d\n\nHaving cited a potential $58 trillion total addressable market, rather than competing in the general retail space, they focus on drilling down in \u201chard to do, hard to copy\u201d niche verticals. CEO McHugh: \u201cThat\u2019s why we like the deep verticals as opposed to trying to go head to head in the more general retail space which is more susceptible to scale economics.\u201d\n\nThrough its emerging Unity Platform, Paysafe is also differentiating itself with a single cloud-based payment gateway that synthesizes a large [suite](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1833835/000119312521055290/d18419df4a.htm) of interconnected products and payment rails:\n\n* credit and debit card processing\n* integrated eCommerce processing\n* online banking with real-time bank payments\n* ACH check transactions\n* digital wallets with real-time pay-in/pay-out functionality\n* person to person payments in 40 currencies\n* eCash solutions to digitize cash reaching a massive underbanked consumer base\n* 38 \\[digital\\] currencies in over 90 markets\n* trading in the wallet\n* international money transfers\n* branded gift card management\n* recurring billing\n* data mining for targeted direct marketing\n* travel safeguarding for most major airlines\n* tokenization and encryption (NFTs)\n* in-store brick-and-mortar frictionless checkout (with competitive scalable pricing for a wider range of business sizes)\n\nAs the CEO points out, \u201cMerchants just want sales regardless of payment method\u2026There are very few competitors that can compete with us across all of the products\u2026we continue to see the combination of our eCommerce gateway, digital wallets, online banking, and eCash solutions as a true differentiator in the market\u2026The company that can synthesize that onto one platform will do very well.\"\n\n# Reviews:\n\nWhile on the topic of competition, Bears who apparently aren\u2019t aware of Paysafe\u2019s award winning consumer products like [Paysafecard](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/PAYSAFE-LIMITED-120977165/news/Paysafe-Paysafecard-wins-Hermes-Business-Award-2021-36750942/) and [Skrill](https://www.paymentexpert.com/2019/11/01/skrill-wins-best-digital-wallet-at-juniper-research-2019-awards/), often point to an odd Trustpilot 1.9/5 star rating of nondescript \u201cPaysafe\u201d with only 287 reviews.\n\nMeanwhile, they ignore Trustpilot ratings of Paysafe\u2019s actual consumer-facing products like:\n\n* Paysafecard: \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) [43K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n* Skrill: \u201cgreat\u201d (4/5 stars) [19K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/skrill.com)\n* Skrill Money Transfer: \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars) [9K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/transfers.skrill.com)\n\nBy contrast, Trustpilot rates competitors:\n\n* PayPal: \u201cbad\" (1.2/5 stars) [20K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)\n* Stripe: \u201cAverage\u201d (3.3/5 stars) [6.6K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/stripe.com)\n* Cash App: \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars) [3K reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/cash.app)\n* Zelle: \u201cbad\u201d (1.1/5 stars) [398 reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/zellepay.com)\n* Venmo: \u201cbad\u201d (1.3/5 stars) [281 reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/venmo.com)\n\nNote: This is not to bash competitors, but to point out how the bear argument is essentially meaningless. To be fair, those competing platforms get much better Apple mobile app reviews but, even there, Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill gets a respectable, [4.4 out of 5 stars](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/skrill-pay-transfer-money/id718248239) with 7.2K ratings.

If Mr. Muskrat announces that a stock split will occur, the stock would presumably touch $1500.\n\nAssuming TSLA launches cybertruck, we get even more pump. If robotaxi start coming out within that time (even though they were supposed to be here already) the stock literally doubles.\n\nGigaberlin, Gigachad and Gigamango will also come out pretty quickly. The rising stock price would be used to issue more shares and Tesla will then also own its battery manufacturer too, thus vertically integrating the company.\n\nAssuming 1M robotaxi is here by the end of that time and they perform 10 trips every day, and assuming average revenue from each trip being $20, they will have $73B in revenue from that alone. Also, they are going to issue more shares and buy other boomer production units and going to ramp their production capacity to half the total production capacity of the entire auto industry.\n\nImagine that! Also, they are going to decimate oil and gas companies and steal a lot of their market share, if they steal 10% market share from them that would be worth $160B in revenue at least. Granted the margin will be pretty low but this will position them better for the future.\n\nWe are not going to talk about the positive impacts of the extreme amount of short dated OTM call options and the feedback loop it creates by gamma hedging, granted it may also reverse but we are not going to count that.\n\nIf you think TSLA cult investors are going to not diamond hand, you are an idiot.

AMZN was trading at 3290 when I got in- so I was secured that it would go up more likey than go down. \n\n>Secondly, I looked at the RSI, which slows that AMZN is way oversold for the past week. It is not very likely that it will be more sold. RSI at 40 is an oversold indication.\n\n>Thirdly, looking at MACD, the signal line was still below the MACD line even after massive sell off and low RSI- this is again a bullish signal- although the MACD was much more closer and could not be used accurately here. \n\n>Fourthly, DMA and DMI both show bullish trend as daily moving average and DMI are above the average. \n\n>Fifth, the moving average 200 days shows 3330 yesterday but the stock was at around 3312- this gives the indication that to get to the \u201caverage\u201d- it should move up more than down. Another bullish indicator.\n\n>Sixth, BOLL shows that yesterday, AMZN was moving at slightly lower than midpoint. This is indicating that it should move up for average once again but it is totally possible for it to go down to meet the min support at 3213$, which is 100$ loss.

{"title": "\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I SPY, QQQ TA - Thursday Nov. 4, 2021", "selftext": "# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice\n\n3 Nov 2021\n\n* Stocks climbed to a record after the Fed signaled that monetary policy will remain accommodative even as the central bank starts reducing its massive bond-buying program this month.\n* The S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ 100, and Russell 2000 all closed at all-time highs for the second straight session, a feat not seen since January 2018. The yield curve steepened after Fed Chair Jerome Powell sought to emphasise that the tapering decision does not imply that rate rises are imminent. He stated that officials can be patient with tightening, but will not hesitate to act if inflation warrants it. The dollar dropped.\n* Traders mostly kept their bets on the timing of interest-rate hikes at the level they were at before the decision. Rate rises of around 55 basis points are predicted by money-market derivatives by the end of 2022. According to overnight index swaps, the first raise is expected around July, with a roughly 70% likelihood of occurring the month earlier.\n* On Wednesday, the Treasury revealed the first decline in its quarterly sale of longer-term debt in more than five years, showing reduced borrowing needs as the wave of pandemic-relief spending recedes.\n* Companies in the United States created the most jobs in four months, indicating that employers are making headway in filling a near-record number of unfilled positions. The figures come ahead of the Labor Department's monthly employment report, which is expected to indicate that private payrolls climbed by 408,000 in October. In October, service providers expanded at a record pace, fueled by solid demand and increased business activity.\n\n[Chart and Price Targets from \ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I SPY TA - Wednesday Nov. 3, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlnfw5/i_spy_ta_1102_recap_and_1103_analysis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n# SPY - Nov. 3 Price Action\n\n* Open: 461.30\n* High: 465.15 (0.13 away from \ud83d\udc02 \ud83c\udfaf )\n* Low: 460.83\n* Close: 464.72\n* Volume: 46,811,276\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wkky0kcqegx71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=18cd454cca9ecba874cd0528bb273761981fbb64\n\n# SPY - Nov. 4  - Analysis\n\n## Options Data\n\n* Call total: 6,133,538\n* Put total: 13,430,564\n* Call volume: 1,457,189\n* Put volume: 1,745,635\n* \ud83d\udd11 gamma strike: 460\n* \ud83d\udd11 delta strike: 460\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2jphi9lqzix71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=242cddedf83c2246e398323b009f06755fb8bdc8\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n* Support - 461.44 - 460.57\n* \ud83d\udd0e support - 463.61\n* \ud83d\udd0e resistance - 466.23\n* \ud83d\udc02 \ud83c\udfaf - 467.56 - 468.94 - 471.09\n* \ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udfaf - 459.26 - 458.49 - 457.60 - 456.75\n* \ud83d\udc02 in charge above 20 SMMA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fvydwhttegx71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=771a97ad380ff760d2334b1441a764bde6af8074\n\n## RSI - 65 min.\n\n* Overbought\n* Near 10/15 high\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ca330n0xegx71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=87f523333fb16e0ffd20d8c346662c629b67675e\n\n# OBV - 1 day\n\n* At 9/02 high - 11.295B\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o15iiiwzegx71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d221d2723f9e2061e403440550897697b01975a\n\n## MACD - 65 min.\n\n* Cross\n* Broke \ud83d\udc3b divergence\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tllfwh72fgx71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf9e9b085571e9b4dc8ba6b54faba66571b9557d\n\n## SPY v Vix\n\n* Divergence\n* \ud83d\udc02 want VIX under 16.8\n* \ud83d\udc3b want VIX below 16.8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m0ij10ou6hx71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=307a47921214b70a3ed20a1d9c91fbb8c94cf707\n\n## VIX & SPY Analysis\n\n* Downtrend since March 2020\n* After each spike hit and after SPY reclaimed new all-time highs, it appears SPY continued bull run for additional 2-4 months before next major VIX spike.\n* Something to keep an eye on.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3prlgax6fgx71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=78d48817f1ca5d8e638958f249927d826442a89f\n\n# QQQ - Nov. 4 - Analysis\n\n## Options Data\n\n* Call total: 3,008,903\n* Put total: 6,090,918\n* Call volume: 552,037\n* Put volume: 614,736\n* \ud83d\udd11 gamma strike: 380\n* \ud83d\udd11 delta strike: 375\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xtyhio3s3lx71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=e086dae0e58ba9fb7b652c2b248818520f05f3b3\n\n## Technical Analysis\n\n* Support - 390.42 - 388.00\n* \ud83d\udd0e resistance - 384.70\n* \ud83d\udc02 \ud83c\udfaf - 397.33 - 400.55 - 403.13\n* \ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udfaf - 385.65 - 382.31\n* \ud83d\udc02 in charge above 20 SMMA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8cataa7afgx71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=6187dd2e9b295ced7a69ea1517a87fc776f1713c\n\n## RSI - 65 min.\n\n* Overbought\n* Near August' high\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bdoijuncfgx71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e9d9cf6ba693c95cf308f153cdac33b952a86a4\n\n## OBV - 65 min.\n\n* \ud83d\udc02 want above -2.682m\n* Sept. high - 170.748k\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ddeyl0ffgx71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=673c066702c08e04bb22ef36715b908010b1b279\n\n## Need to Know Market Risk - Financial Juice\n\n* ECB's President Lagarde: In terms of interest rates, 2022 is off the chart.\n* Fed's Powell: We can be patient when it comes to rates.\n* Fed: Taper starting november, monthly reductions of $15b\n* US Interest Rate Decision Actual 0.25% (Forecast 0.25%, Previous 0.25%) - DXY Weakened, S&P 500 Strengthened.\n* Pentagon issues a warning China's nuclear stockpile is growing faster than expected.\n* ECB's Villeroy: There's no reason for the ECB to hike interest rates next year.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\n\ud83c\udf1dNightMan\n\n# Positions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ndm7ap2mfgx71.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd85152903a69af0f488b2c0b151733700d617e4", "id": "qm5qs6", "created_utc": 1635977625.0, "score": 63, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Hey op good writing .. wish you trades do well.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks friend!
