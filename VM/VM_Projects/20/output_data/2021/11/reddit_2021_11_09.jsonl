{"title": "I SPY TA - Tuesday Nov. 9, 2021", "selftext": "# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice\n\n* After corporate earnings, good hiring data, and a covid treatment breakthrough boosted optimism in the world's largest economy, US equities crept higher, with the S&P 500 recording its longest winning run since 2017. The value of the dollar and treasuries decreased.\n* For the eighth session in a row, the S&P 500 climbed 0.1% powered by energy producers and materials, as investors flocked into firms that profit the most from a healthy economy. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 plummeted, weighed down by Tesla Inc.'s 4.9% drop after Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his stock, to which they responded positively.\n* Last week's news flow, which included the passing of a $550 billion infrastructure bill, washed away concerns that high inflation and the Federal Reserve's intention to reduce asset purchases would disrupt economy. The results of Pfizer Inc.'s viral therapy, as well as the easing of US travel restrictions, have fueled anticipation that corporations will continue to report excellent earnings.\n* However, the recent rate of increases may make it difficult for stocks to move much higher in the absence of a new trigger.\n* On Wednesday, markets will be watching a measure of US consumer pricing intently after advances in US payrolls last week revealed an increase in average hourly earnings.\n* Oil fell to $82 a barrel in New York after the United States suggested it may reveal measures to lower oil and gasoline costs as soon as this week. Meanwhile, European gas and power costs have risen on fears that Russia may not fulfill the supply boost promised by Putin.\n* In Europe, the Stoxx 600 remained almost unchanged.\n\n# SPY Recap - Nov. 8S\n\n# PY - Nov. 8 - Analysis\n\n* Support - 468.99 - 467.29\n* Micro  resistance - 470.68\n* Bullish targets: - 473.54 - 476.08\n* Bearish targets - 465.26 - 463.61 - 462.01\n* Bulls in charge above 20 SMMA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kw4sbpl1vgy71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=368091a669a9c202e9ed1fee5a93aa8977e4f32d\n\n# SPY - Nov. 8 - Price Action\n\n* *Open: 469.70*\n* *High: 470.22*\n* *Low: 468.20*\n* *Close: 468.93*\n* *Volume: 46,571,832*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f9wl4hx3vgy71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=88531c8f2076862a76904b7cdf7a35bf7db342ca\n\n# SPY - Nov. 9 - Analysis\n\n# Options Data\n\n* Put Volume Total: 1,990,534\n* Call Volume Total: 1,741,604\n* Put/Call Volume Ratio: 1.14\n* Put Open Interest Total: 13,343,120\n* Call Open Interest Total: 6,655,094\n* Put/Call Open Interest Ratio: 2.00\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fs0474q5vgy71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=910398aee4bd9fa0c39cf99a739fd56b3e12dbb4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/alagbym6vgy71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=d41d566cbd105b99a6ce7a361514ea33a4973387\n\n# Technical Analysis - 65 min.\n\n* Support - 468.99 - 467.29\n* Micro resistance - 470.68\n* Bullish targets - 473.54 - 476.08\n* Bearish targets - 465.26 - 463.61 - 462.01\n* Bulls in charge above 20 SMMA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ctleefm8vgy71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=92b3d9436f3fe7b2eedb14ec586e6e624e2c697b\n\n# RSI - 65 min.\n\n* Above 50\n* Continued downtrend from Nov. 5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/12d06vdavgy71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=864a1323bebe02ecbaca5cbe5690b497a55df7b0\n\n# MACD - 65 min.\n\n* Cross extension\n* Broke uptrend from Oct. 28\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jjeugr2fvgy71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1d732a1caffc29b4154b6287d86c8390e968d26\n\n# SPY v Vix - 65 min.\n\n* 17.22+0.74 (+4.49%)\n* \ud83d\udc02 want VIX under 16.28\n* \ud83d\udc3b want VIX 17.79+\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2o40osbhvgy71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d56a2010b69567ab0adee2c0792af695e319bdd\n\n# Need to Know Market Risk - Financial Juice\n\n* Fed's Evans: By the spring, we will know a lot more about the inflation picture.\n* Fed's Harker: I does not expect the Federal Funds Rate to rise before the Fed's bond tapering is completed.\n* Euronext to ditch London stock exchange for clearing by 2024.\n* Fed's Clarida: By the end of 2022, I expect a full recovery to pre-pandemic employment levels, with the unemployment rate at 3.8% and participation growing.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\n\ud83c\udf1dNightMan", "id": "qprpqy", "created_utc": 1636418762.0, "score": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "My calls better print", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Godspeed brother.

They have documented almost all the IPOs from 2000. But for this analysis, I also needed stock price-related information for periods long after the stock had been listed in the market.\n\nThe stock price information was obtained using Yahoo Finance. After all the quality checks, we are left with 1,063 IPOs from 2000-2020. All the data used in the analysis has been shared through a Google sheet at the end.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/i0qp7kdhbky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=110867d59c8346b1e3f1078affe60ac3e752eb1f)\n\n**Analysis**\n\nSince the idea is to find the best time to invest in an IPO, we have to compare the returns for multiple time periods. I calculated the one month and one year returns in case you had invested on the day of the IPO as well as if you had invested in the stock after\n\n1. One day\n2. One week\n3. One month\n\nThe returns are then compared against each other to find the optimal time to invest in the stock after it has IPO\u2019d. The returns were finally benchmarked against SPY to see if it makes sense to put in all these efforts - only to maybe underperform the market!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6uzzc6dhbky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=e96457e42228d1c17e40a5081f856d81959f4982\n\n **Results** \n\n[ All calculations are done using the adjusted closing price  ](https://preview.redd.it/yi23mapjbky71.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=be4aeccefdd084f92a071f047aed62f7938ec668)\n\nSurprisingly, the gains you would have made from the IPOs are inversely proportional to the amount of time you waited for your investment. On average **the most amount of return is obtained by someone who invested on the day of the IPO itself**. The more amount of time you wait for your investment, the lesser your return is!\n\nBut what if you are not interested in the short-term returns? What if you are a buy-and-hold type of investor?\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/j5yu28qkbky71.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8fd218f14d640fed25cefe8d586c8786ecd8525)\n\nIf you are a long-term investor, **you would be better off buying the IPO after waiting for a week**, as it generated the most amount of return. But what is interesting is that waiting a week for the hype to die down would only increase your return by 9%. Waiting any further would only ***decrease your overall return.***\n\nSo if you are planning on buying into an IPO but did not get an allocation at the listing price, you can wait a week so as to see how it performs in the market, avoid any large swings that the first week might cause, and still come out on top over the long run!\n\nNow, let\u2019s compare the performance of IPO stocks against SPY. After all, even though you are getting a good return on your investment, if it does not beat the market, you would have been better off just investing it in SPY rather than doing all this research on IPOs.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/bvvov5olbky71.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=81c5449fe6b5bcb3824d23ce3cfe690e5cfc17c1)\n\nIPOs\u2019 returns on average ***beat the market*** over the last two decades. The trends are similar to the ones observed earlier with the delta over the market return depending on how much time you waited before investing into the IPO and generating the highest amount of delta by waiting one week from the day of the IPO.\n\nNow it would be amiss not to discuss the inherent risks associated with investing in an IPO. Out of the 1,063 IPO\u2019s in our analysis, only 62% of them gained in value and only a measly 29% of the IPOs beat the market over the long run. The outperformance over the market is coming due to a few outliers (Tesla - 25,000%+, Shopify - 5800%+, etc.) If you miss out on the top 1% of successful IPOs, your returns would be much lesser than the market.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/14fodwdhbky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=d515dcc6d1ad6600ac2596cfb10bbeeb4135004d)\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe above analysis comes with some limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy\n\n1. The number of IPOs in the analysis is approximately 1/3rd of the total IPOs which occurred during 2000-2020 \\[4\\]. I don\u2019t think this is a major concern since our sample of 1000+ stocks would be much more than enough to give statistical significance to our analysis.\n2. Another limitation is that the delta that you are observing here might just be due to the additional risk that you are taking by buying into lesser-known/small-cap companies. The risk-adjusted return might give a different result.\n3. Continuing from the above point, we are currently in a massive bull run with ATH being broken every week. So the additional risk you are taking will be well rewarded but the outcome might look different if we do the same analysis in the middle of a bear market.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/a6afrmehbky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f67a849e47f6d4002a91773eea79c3a91851edf)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nBuying into an IPO is an exciting prospect. Our analysis proves that even if you miss out on getting the IPO allocation, it\u2019s still possible to beat the market by investing after the stock is listed on the market.\n\nAs I [explained in my last post on IP](https://marketsentiment.substack.com/p/can-you-make-money-from-ipos)O, investment banks are incentivized to slightly underprice while listing (unless it\u2019s a really popular company) so that the IPO issue is 100% subscribed (their fees are dependent on a successful IPO) \\[5\\].\n\nWhatever the case may be, if you are planning on holding on to the IPO only for a short period of time, you can maximize your returns by investing in the IPO as soon as it\u2019s listed whereas if you are a long term investor who is planning to hold on to the stock for a very long time, its better to wait a week or so for the stock price to settle before making your move!\n\nAnalysis Sheet containing all the data: [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QqRNZEsTfgG6f8GfI-n6qBAai9wrUA47hFMYg6tz098/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nUntil next week\u2026\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/aylz0ifhbky71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a0ce466944bf4ce2381320c6e28c9e2c36cdec3)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] The company has [only built and delivered 56](https://insideevs.com/news/542908/rivian-production-numbers-first-month/) vehicles as of Oct21. If Rivian IPO\u2019d at $65 Billion, it means that each vehicle it delivered added more than $1 Billion in value to its shareholders. A similarly valued Ford delivered 4.1 Million vehicles in 2020. Truly wild times we are living in!\n\n\\[2\\] Brokerages tend to allocate IPO shares to their premium clients - [In the case of TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/investment-products/IPOs.html), your account must have a value of at least $250,000 or have completed 30 trades in the last 3 months.\n\n\\[3\\] Take the examples of Robinhood and Coinbase IPO. Robinhood tanked on listing day losing 8% only to rally almost 100% in the next one week before coming back down to near its IPO pricing. Coinbase also had a wild ride on listing day with the share price going as high as $429 before crashing back down to \\~$310.\n\n\\[4\\] The major limitation was the absence of financial data in Yahoo Finance for certain stocks.\n\n\\[5\\] There are a lot of contradictory opinions regarding this with [some research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0275531918309280) showcasing that IPO\u2019s are usually undervalued while [others argue](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/17/3/811/1612977?redirectedFrom=PDF) that IPOs are overvalued.

{"title": "Virgin Galactic - The Ultimate Growth Stock", "selftext": "**Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is the world\u2019s first, and only, publicly-traded human spaceflight company.** It was founded by Sir Richard Branson as part of the Virgin Group conglomerate empire in 2004. So why is this stock so exciting? Here\u2019s a brief overview.\n\n# WHAT DO THEY DO?\n\nVirgin Galactic operate in commercial **sub-orbital tourism and scientific research,** and have successfully done so on numerous occasions, most notably the inaugural flight with Sir Richard Branson in July 2021 - becoming **the first company in history to take a private citizen into space.** The company is currently in the late stages of its test flight program and expects to commence commercial operations in 2022Q4, largely due to pandemic-induced delays and test program precautions.\n\nThe company uses a **unique method of flight into space,** with a plane-like spacecraft being attached to the underside of a twin-fuselage mothership. This allows for a familiar and comfortable takeoff before the spaceship is released at 50,000ft, ignites its engine and ascends into a vertical climb at three times the speed of sound (2,500mph, Mach 3). At apogee the spacecraft then raises its booms in order to orientate and stabilise it for the descent, much like a shuttlecock, before simply gliding back to the runway. In the case of a flight abortion, the unique hybrid rocket motor is able to be shut down and the craft simply glides back in the same manner - making it an extremely safe launch system when compared to the parachutes and irreversible ignitions of every other company.\n\nThe customer will be given a **multi-day experience**, with astronaut training, preparatory flights onboard the mothership, accommodation, exclusive astronaut attire by Under Armour amongst other undisclosed activities being briefly outlined, in addition to **the company\u2019s announcement of the development of an Astronaut Campus** during 2021Q2\u2019s ER to accommodate tourists and their friends/families. Furthermore, in February 2021 **announced the recruitment of legendary Disney imagineer Joe Rohde to oversee this** as the strategic advisor, designing the customer experience and drawing upon over four decades of experience. This follows the **recruitment of ex-President and Managing Director of Disney Michael Colglazier as CEO,** to oversee the transition to commercial operations, replacing ex-CEO of ten years **George Whitesides (formerly NASA chief of staff) who will now oversee high-speed mobility and orbital spaceflight programs.** Other management and board members include figures from **Lockheed Martin, Warner Bros., DARPA, Boeing, Facebook, Twitter, Virgin, American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Air France, and KLM.**\n\nFollowing the trend of other space companies, the company does not hold direct patents on its technology but instead an exclusive license from Mojave Aerospace Ventures *(formed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and Burt Rutan of Scaled Composites),* the winners of the 2004 Ansari X Prize. Virgin Group and Scaled Composites subsequently formed The Spaceship Company with 70/30% respective ownership, and this became wholly owned by Virgin Group after Scaled\u2019s acquisition by Northrop Grumman in 2012. TSC was absorbed into Virgin Galactic in 2020, making the company **vertically integrated in the design, manufacturing and use of its vehicles and propulsion systems.**\n\nIn its seventeen-year history, the company has received more than its fair share of criticism due to a number of setbacks. In 2014 the venture was faced with the crash of the first craft, VSS Enterprise, during its fourth powered test flight - resulting in the death of its co-pilot. **The company was wrongly criticised at the time** for distancing themselves from the incident by referring to the pilots as Scaled Composites employees, but the resultant investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was due to said co-pilot unlocking the craft\u2019s aforementioned boom section prematurely, causing it to break up in mid-air during rocket burn while travelling beyond the speed of sound. Furthermore, the FAA concluded that Scaled Composites/Northrop Grumman did not create an adequate fail-safe system in addition to citations of inadequate design safeguards, poor training of inexperienced pilots and oversight failures by the FAA. As a result, VSS Unity was rolled out in early 2016 and featured the relative fail-safe enhancements, though accompanied by a significant delay to the test programme.\n\nVSS Unity itself has faced some minor setbacks in the last couple of years, such as an ignition abortion in late 2020 due to electromagnetic interference in the on-board computer systems, which has since been resolved. This **additional demonstration of safety was well received by investors, and the stock proceeded to climb to all-time highs** following the incident in anticipation of the following flight. VSS Unity has since gone on to essentially complete the test flight programme, culminating in Sir Richard Branson\u2019s notable flight to demonstrate the private astronaut experience, and will be in regular commercial service after the ongoing planned maintenance period. The company had intended for its first full-revenue flight with Italian Air Force specialists to take place in October 2021, but this was rescheduled in favour of maintenance aimed at significantly decreasing flight turnaround times from 8 weeks in order to meet demand while also ensuring the relevant components of \u00a0both the craft and the mothership remain well within the desired margins of safety. **The company have repeatedly stated that no detectable faults appear present on either VSS Unity or VMS Eve, and these improvements are simply diagnostic and precautionary; being geared towards longevity.** Despite being a full-revenue flight, the company is treating the Italian Air Force flight as part of the test programme and will consequently demonstrate the professional astronaut and private research experience publically. **While the flight has been moved from the beginning to the end of the maintenance cycle, the overall post-pandemic schedule is on track.**The company had also received significant and unjust criticism due to an FAA investigation into the inaugural flight due to a deviation in the flight path taking the ship out of its restricted airspace, totalling one and a half minutes during descent, which was safely corrected. There was also controversy from a news article in The New Yorker criticising the company's safety record after it was falsely reported that a warning light was ignored by the pilots. The same journalist also released a book, 'Test Gods' shortly prior to the article's publication, and both heavily rely on disgruntled ex-test pilot lead Mark Stucky - who was released for undisclosed reasons. **The resultant investigation subsequently increased the airspace afforded to the company, and the trajectory is deemed safe and viable flight profile.**\n\nIn March 2021 the **company also rolled out the successor to SpaceshipTwo, Spaceship III - VSS Imagine.** Commencement of manufacturing for at least one other SS3, VSS Inspire, has been disclosed *(with 85% of the components being fabricated),* and previous earnings calls outline a desire to **expand the fleet to five ships over the next three years.** However, the company has since released plans for a successor to Spaceship III, the Delta Class, alongside a new mothership; **providing increased cabin capacity and altitude.** This new design is aimed at **scalability and mass production in order to combat manufacturing and operational costs and timeframes** due to the current designs being largely hand fabricated, and they continue to seek further strategic partnerships to aid this transition. The company aims for a flight turnaround of one week for Delta Class ships, and is currently in the concept design phase - exploring tooling, supply chain and fabrication. To facilitate this, **the company is also investing in a new Design & Collaboration Centre as well as pursuing an undisclosed strategic partnership for the creation of next-generation motherships, in addition to exploring ship storage facilities in preparation for mass-production.**VSS Imagine is currently in ground testing with glide and powered testing to commence upon the fulfilment of the aforementioned maintenance period from mid-2022, before transitioning to commercial service in 2023Q1 for research payloads prior to pivoting to tourists in 2023Q2/3. The intent for VSS Inspire\u2019s completion is to be confirmed, though the company has stated that the focus is on a timely transition to significant scale and resources may potentially be redirected.\n\nThere is perhaps **room for the adoption of satellite launches using the WhiteKnight aircraft,** as had been outlined in initial concepts for both Scaled Composites Tier programmes and Virgin\u2019s original business plan, though ultimately operations were spun-off in 2017 to safeguard the company, and the new company, Virgin Orbit, is expected to IPO via reverse merger (NASDAQ:NGCA). Virgin Orbit instead utilise a modified Boeing 747 carrying the LauncherOne rocket rather than the White Knight airframe. While it is likely that Virgin Galactic will continue to focus on commercial human spaceflight, the door remains open.\n\nIn the long term, the company has outlined plans for **point-to-point hypersonic travel,**detailed further below.\n\n# BACKERS AND CONSUMERS\n\nUnsurprisingly, the largest backer of Virgin Galactic is Virgin Group. Other investors into the then private company include **Aabar Investments (the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi), whose investment secured regional rights to launch future Virgin flights from the UAE\u2019s capital.** An significant indirect investment comes from **the government of New Mexico through the creation of Spaceport America**, of which Virgin Galactic is the anchor tenant, having also transferred 60% of their personnel there in 2019. In October 2019 the company went public via reverse merger through **ex-Facebook Senior Executive Chamath Palihapitiya\u2019s Social Capital** and has since received strong institutional and retail backing.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the company seeks to form strategic partnerships and has done so with a number of companies. In late 2016 the company along with its parent announced its **collaboration with Boom Technology to aid in the design, manufacturing and testing of a new supersonic craft, \u2018Overture\u2019, a net-zero carbon emissions airframe** which would fly at around Mach 2 with vastly improved fuel economy, operating costs and aerodynamics than Concorde. Boom is currently entering the test phase of prototyping and both companies anticipate the craft to be \\*\\*operational by 2029.\\*\\*Virgin Galactic holds **purchase options on the first ten units, providing the first mover advantage,** and this precedes an order by United Airlines for 15 airframes and options for an additional 35 by some considerable timeframe. Overture is **expected to rollout in 2025**before test flights commence in 2026. Aviation analysts **Boyd Group International predict that if the production plane meets expectations the global demand will be at least 1,300 airframes** compared to just 14 Concordes which were ever in service. The precise structure of this agreement is unclear, but it presents an opportunity for a significant revenue boost from a portion of manufacturing sales and commercial use.\n\nFurther relating to Virgin Galactic\u2019s hypersonic aspirations, **the company announced a memorandum of understanding in mid-2020 with Rolls Royce** relating to the creation of new propulsion methods for commercial aircraft, fostering relationships between the two companies. This accompanied the simultaneous announcement that **The Spaceship Company had completed its review of a hypersonic aircraft along with receiving FAA authorisation,** meaning both the company and the agency are currently designing an adequate testing/certification framework for the Mach 3+ aircraft.\n\nNotable relationships include **Boeing, whose investment arm bought $20M of stock after the company went public**, reportedly to align and foster larger relationships between the companies in the future. **Under Armour also manufacture astronaut attire and the materials for the spaceship\u2019s seating,** and the company also \\*\\*collaborates with Land Rover on STEM programmes as well as providing vehicles for operational use.\\*\\*The company has also fostered **relations with NASA for astronaut training and research payloads** as part of the Flight Opportunities programme.\n\nThe company targets high net worth individuals and aspires to expand into multiple spaceports around the world, each with unique customer experiences. **Present opportunities include the aforementioned deal with the United Arab Emirates, alongside the continuation of talks initiated in 2019 with the Italian government** and the opportunity for **potential future agreements at initial planned locations in the United Kingdom, Sweden, and Japan.**\n\n# FINANCIALS & VALUATION\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that **the commercial space sector will reach 5% of GDP by 2040, totalling around $1.5T**. Additionally, in 2018 Bain & Company show that **spending trends favour luxury experiences, outpacing the broader segment growth by 7% with a YOY compounding growth rate of 10%**. Using figures from the Credit Suisse Research Institute, Virgin Galactic estimated in 2019Q4 that they will initially serve 0.1% of individuals with a $10M+ net worth (a market of around 2.5M individuals compounding 6% YOY; a few thousand customers), making them an **elite luxury experience with significant room to expand - let alone repeat business.** The company has also demonstrated its **highly selective customer process** for funnelling its expressions of interest into its Future Astronaut cohort through the time-limited 'One Small Step' initiative, then again adopting paid-up members into its Spacefarer community. This ensures that demand remains strong and manageable, and the company expects tickets to be released in tranches of 1000.\n\nThe company has steadily held reservations from their spacefarer/future astronaut communities, **having confirmed at least 700 sales as of September 2021 with a view to close the first tranche of 1000 ticket sales by the holidays.** Currently tickets cost $450,000 *(up from an initial price of $250,000 pre-Branson flight),* and the company collects a $150K deposit, $25K of which is non-refundable. This is merely a fraction of the $28M Blue Origin recently charged for a single suborbital flight ticket, and they are presently the only competition - though a vastly different experience. Both SpaceshipTwo and Spaceship III have a capacity of six passengers, at an estimated launch cost of around $250,000 due to hybrid rocket motor replacement - **generating around $2.5M in profit per full-capacity flight.** After re-opening initial registrations for the second tranche of ticket sales, **the company received over 60,000 expressions of interest.**The company also functions in both **private and government research sectors**, with payloads costing $600,000 per seat-equivalent. **This would generate around $3.5M in profit per research-only flight.** Indeed, these margins are what initially drove Chamath Palihapitya to focus on the company and also invest an $100M in his own cash, citing that they were unheard of outside of the technology sector. The company aims to generate **$1B annually per spaceport** from roughly 400 spaceflights divided between around 10 ships.\n\nThe company is currently pre-commercial operations, and as such is virtually pre-revenue which makes traditional valuation methods problematic. However, the company has roughl**y $1B on hand in cash and equivalents in order to successfully transition to commercial operations and scale**, and also has yet to collect revenue from sales beyond deposits. This makes an accurate valuation particularly difficult from a revenue standpoint, but fundamentally the company is strong in its balance sheet and maintains a huge financial runway to transition into a global entity, while the outlook remains incredibly bright in its technology development, vertical integration, expansion plans and consumer demand.\n\nIn my opinion this stock has been wrongly beaten down over the last year, and given the scope of the company I believe it to be massively undervalued. It is is a first-mover with an entirely unique product and a proven brand identity in an industry they are creating essentially single-handedly, and therefore I believe that in the next decade and beyond the stock is poised to be the market\u2019s biggest growth story. Furthermore, considering their assets alone in terms of cash/equivalents, IP, assets, personnel and outlook I believe bear-case this is $25-30 stock in the current market. **Current analyst average estimates place this stock at around $32, with $18 on the low side and $55 on the up for the near term. The stock currently trades at $19.**Once commercial operations begin, I believe that a reasonable multiple in current market conditions can place this stock comfortably into a new channel between $50-$75 within twelve months, and once the company can execute on its aspiration for operating a fully-fledged spaceport generating $1B annually this stock will be $300 by 2030 (a multiple of around 90), and possibly significantly higher depending on expansion into other locations, the development of hypersonic point-to-point flight operations, and the potential to license and leverage its IP into the broader aerospace sector. Also, given the scope of the ever unfolding commercial space industry I believe that beyond 2030 this stock could ascend essentially without limit as the company continues to grow and expand into new markets.\n\n**So what do you think about NYSE:SPCE?

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, Nov 9, 2021", "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 9, 2021**\n\nThe stock market took a breather, putting a pause on this record-breaking rally, with all three major indexes closing the day lower. In recent weeks, market participants have rode an extended wave of optimism amid better than expected earnings season, new, better than expected economic data, the passage of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in Congress, and a new antiviral coronavirus pill from Pfizer (PFE). \n\nWith roughly 89% of companies in the S&P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds. \n\n[https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight\\_110521.pdf](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_110521.pdf)\n\nMarci McGregor, Bank of America Merryl Lynch Senior Investment Strategist said, \u201cI still think it\u2019s all about corporate profits.  I know a lot of my peers are concerned that peak earnings growth is behind us. But I think peak earnings isn\u2019t even a 2022 story. We\u2019re seeing solid consumer demand, a strong U.S. economy, and I think we\u2019re going to have a capex cycle in 2022. And I think that\u2019s all positive for corporate profits, and that underpins this market, in my view.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite positive earnings, a host of companies have cited constraints around raw materials, labor shortages, and general supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. According to Bank of America, mentions of supply chains on quarterly earnings calls have surged by 360% compared to last year, underscoring the widespread nature of these pressures. These supply-related issues have also contributed to still-elevated inflationary trends. Tuesday's Producer Price Index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that producer prices rose by 8.6% over last year, matching October's rate for the fastest on record in data going back to Nov. 2010. \n\nKristina Hooper, Chief Global Market Strategist at Invesco, said \u201cI would expect inflation to peak by mid-year 2022. It should remain elevated but it should move lower in the back half of 2022. So while this is certainly an issue, it is part of what we should expect coming out of the pandemic. We have gotten out of a burning building, but we should expect that there is a little smoke and water damage as a result. That\u2019s really what we\u2019re experiencing with elevated inflation and supply chain disruptions\u201d. I agree with this position and think the analogy is very apt. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Tesla (TSLA) stock fell more than 10%, pushing down the entire EV sector with it, as the stock price feels the effect of Elon Musk\u2019s poll where he said he would be selling 10% of his stake in Tesla. \n* President Biden interviewed Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard for the job of Chairperson, signaling a serious rival to Jerome Powell Powell as Biden is set to nominate a new leader to the Fed in the coming weeks. I really hope Powell is re-assigned, the market does not need a shakeup right now.\n* Peloton (PTON) continued its sharp drop following earnings, dispute the company revealing a new product designed to track your performance on the bike and give you feedback\n* Roblox (RBLX) stock gapped up hard today while PayPal (PYPL) fell after reporting earnings yesterday afternoon. \n* Twitter (TWTR) launched a new subscription service, called Twitter Blue for $3 a month that allows one to undo or correct tweets, among other mostly aesthetic upgrades.\n* NVIDIA (NVDA), my favorite stock, said it was partnering with a range of self-driving sensor companies, including lidar firm Luminar Technologies (LAZR), to put together a system for autonomous driving as soon as 2024.\n* Moreover, NVIDIA also announced it was releasing a set of tools, called \u201cOmniverse Enterprise\u201d. Their Omniverse, which was beta launched in December, is a simulation and collaboration platform which \u201cserves as the connective tissue for physically accurate 3D virtual worlds,\u201d according to the company. In prepared remarks, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in his keynote address that with Omniverse, \u201cwe now have the technology to create new 3D worlds or model our physical world.\u201d Omniverse Enterprise, which costs $9,000 a year, is also available to customers in a 30-day trial. Just another example of how NVIDIA is going key to powering technology of the future.   \n* Netflix (NFLX) is launching a new TikTok-like short clip feature for kids called \u201cKids Clips\u201d as soon as this week. Netflix said it would add new shirts based on its current and future offerings.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) with two target raises.

Converting my small $800 investment into $22,000 within these said 2 weeks.\n\nNVDA Price action always follows the same pattern from what I have noticed. We open high and its either push higher or come crashing back down only to recover later during power hour or the following day.\n\nFor the last 3 trading days NVDA has had some amazing price movements. Giving me the ability to turn 800 into 22 thousand. At one point reaching $42k but as a true autist I did not sell.\n\nThis stock has given us some amazing returns YOY. For tomorrow we can expect NVDA to break to new ATH (if it is able to break through 314). We can see a very bullish case of 314, 317, 320, 338. I am not saying this will happen tomorrow or the next day. All I am saying is if we break through tomorrow we can make some sweet tendies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zcj3eqsw3hy71.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=346d7a59ce4f2ae1f797336eb9063b9a5f4b7031\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday I gave a trade idea which I did not take due to going deep into nada. This call out was AMD $145C Nov 12. These were trading at 1 and went up to 10.6 over 2 days. They won MSFT and METAs business. However, I believe that NVDA will run tomorrow since they also have an event regarding their omniverse business.\n\nFor tomorrow $320 weeklies will be hot. See chart above for a clear view of this bullish pennant. With that I wish you guys luck and lets make some money.\n\nPositions:\n\nNVDA $320 Nov 12 x 10", "id": "qpsm6u", "created_utc": 1636421582.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "Don't forget earnings on 11/17.

Following a tweet by investor Michael Burry, Tesla dropped as much as 13%.\n* PayPal dropped after the company's guidance fell short of expectations. General Electric soared after announcing that it would be split into three businesses.\n* Investors are weighing robust earnings, easing travel restrictions and US infrastructure expenditure against the possibility of sustained inflation, which might lead to tighter monetary policy. The producer price index rose in October, adding to concerns about inflationary pressures in the economy.\n* On Wednesday, new consumer price data could contribute to the monetary policy debate, which saw another surprise on Tuesday with reports that Fed's Brainard was interviewed by Biden as he considers whether to re-appoint Fed's Powell.\n* In the meantime, positioning adjustments have spurred advances in long-end Treasuries, bringing the 30-year yield to its lowest level since July. The yield on the US 10-year note has dropped to 1.44%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mxi1em0ifny71.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6e3ef9d681257bc928a2c1438d42704a7a8d6aa\n\n[\ud83d\udd75\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f I SPY, QQQ, IWM TA - Tuesday Nov. 9, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qprlpe/i_spy_ta_tuesday_nov_9_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n\n# SPY Recap - Nov. 9\n\n* *Support - 468.99 - 467.29*\n* *\ud83d\udd0e resistance - 470.68*\n* *\ud83d\udc02 \ud83c\udfaf - 473.54 - 476.08*\n* *\ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udfaf - 465.26 - 463.61 - 462.01*\n* *\ud83d\udc02 in charge above 20 SMMA*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tw3hsemmfny71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=d164076e5953892417ac2cf2740c8148ac4718c0\n\n## SPY - Nov. 9 - Price Action\n\n* *Open:* 469.32\n* *High:* 469.57\n* *Low:* 465.88\n* *Close:* 467.42\n* *Volume: 48,912,903*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x19yynjofny71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4008d16672a5db2f9bc33c21f6c2cf98c6855f7\n\n# SPY - Nov. 10 - Analysis\n\n## Options Data\n\n*Volume totals reflect options traded during the current session (10/9)*\n\n* Put Volume Total: 656,350\n* Call Volume Total: 583,305\n* Put/Call Volume Ratio: 1.13\n* Put Open Interest Total: 200,720\n* Call Open Interest Total: 139,742\n* Put/Call Open Interest Ratio: 1.44\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y256jwyqfny71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=30889cfb00b402c01ede38c00f3dc314a826287d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lndypcrrfny71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=92c0434d3b33d82aecde498e0bf17ace1c31d8e3\n\n## Technical Analysis - 65 min.\n\n* Support - 467.20 - 466.03\n* \ud83d\udd0e resistance - 468.29, 469.49\n* \ud83d\udc02 \ud83c\udfaf - 470.06 - 471.16 - 472.05 -473.39\n* \ud83d\udc3b \ud83c\udfaf - 464.90 - 463.61 - 462.01 - 460.97\n* Resistance at 20 SMMA\n\nNotes:\n\n* Downtrend confirmed with lower-low from Nov. 5\n* Bottomed out for the day at 466.03 ish\n* Fell below 20 SMMA (since 10/27)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/puu2ggwtfny71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdd9d5d2039f8bcb4a133b4f56099d85a9216d44\n\n## RSI - 65 min.\n\n* Below 50\n* Continued downtrend from Nov. 5\n* Still room to run before oversold\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yajb61mvfny71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d46c2f9462697be3e431c8142c8ad68ed28e4ed\n\n# MACD - 65 min.\n\n* Extension\n* Near 0 line\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h9te0e6xfny71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dcbb0595a537f1770710c148b47140bee9f7068\n\n## VI - 65 min. \n\n* Cross\n* Still room to run so may not be bottom\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u8763ssyfny71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8bc9fe7ffc93d8d26b54f98adb169191e84bd39\n\n## VIX - 65 min.\n\n* Filled gap from 10/11\n* Broke downtrend line\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qsber0e0gny71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=ceb0c8c8405ece1f5b8409a3f5f4634689abb3b2\n\n## Need to Know Market Risk - Financial Juice\n\n* Biden called Walmart, UPS, FedEx, and Target CEOs on the supply chain.
