{"title": "Options for a Personal Loan", "selftext": "This post was inspired by a [post from another sub.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/o295rm/amc_iron_condor/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) The gist was an IC spread that was basically all but guaranteed to fail, for which the premium was ridiculous, and the max loss was not much higher than the premium, their bet being they could make more in the meantime than they were destined to lose. Which got me thinking\n\nCould you sell an option strategy like this for basically a personal loan? There are several strategies that I assume would work for this as long as they provided a limited risk which you are 99.9% sure to be assigned. Collect a premium which is as much of the max loss as possible in the meantime. You could potentially kick the can on payback a few years down the road. European style cash settled would eliminate most of the risk of going sideways in an unlikely way.\n\nWhat I don't understand particularly well is how this would affect margin usage (since I don't do much with margin, I only learned in broad strokes). In what instance would you potentially get caught with your pants down here? You would have the amount equal to your max risk locked in your margin buying power (your buying power would increase from the premium, but we're assuming it would then decrease if you withdrew the premium), and now we're well past the territory that I feel like I have any idea what I'm talking about. \n\nAssuming you had a large enough account that the hit to your margin buying power still is fine (especially for people like me not using it), it seems like the major risk would be an overall market crash where your portfolio now isn't worth the max risk you're no longer holding in cash? Poke holes in my understanding.\n\nI may also be misunderstanding the tax laws as well (I haven't given that part much thought), but assuming it goes according to plan the \"interest\" you pay would be a loss so essentially tax deductible.\n\nI do realize \"why?\" is a very fair question, but there are probably a few small instances where it may make sense. Like your car just broke down, you need to get a new one to get to work and get paid, but you're trying to close on a home and don't want to open up a new line of credit, so you make yourself a loan with a crappy \"interest rate\" that's due in 3ish years (much like many auto loans).\n\nOverall I can't imagine that it would be the best idea in many cases, but still...", "id": "o8afjq", "created_utc": 1624712764.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "The way to effectively borrow money from the market is with a box spread.

So for fun I am looking at the highest liquidity underlyings I can think of and the MMs arent stupid... there would be huge slippage getting filled despite the mark displaying 2-3% equivalent APR. The best long ask to short bid I can find with any decent amount open interest or volume would be equivalent to about 15% APR and that is American style options.

{"title": "$TGT is criminally undervalued and has a lot of upside potential in these coming months", "selftext": "Target is currently trading at around $240 per share. Firstly, I believe it's undervalued based on its price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 19.58, when compared to its competitors (COSTCO has a P/E of 36.589, Walmart has a P/E of 31.829). A look at the Enterprise value to EBIDTA ratio (EV/EBIDTA) tells a similar story. It should be noted, though, that TGT has a higher debt-to-equity of 1.02 ratio than some Costco and Walmart, although it isn't high enough to raise concerns about its risk. Based on fundamentals alone, it seems like a solid pick.\n\nThis is supported by the fact that it absolutely crushed earnings back in April, beating EPS by a whopping 104.36% and revenue by a reasonable 14.24%. It saw a nice pump after earnings was disclosed, but it has still steadily increased in price since then (6.1% in the last month).\n\nI think that it will continue to grow now that summer is here and there is increased shopping, not to mention reopening and lifting of COVID restrictions.\n\nPositions: 50 shares at $225 and two 240c expiring Jan 2022\n\nWhat do you think about $TGT?", "id": "o836w4", "created_utc": 1624679358.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|377|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0748877227306366}, {"body": "TGT doesn't have the advantages that Costco and Walmart have (no slaves, and wage slaves respectively).\n\nTarget suffers from it's desire to be not-Walmart and wants to try to pay their employees like they're almost people.\n\nCostco doesn't have employees. 75% of the people you see \"working\" at Costco aren't employees.
