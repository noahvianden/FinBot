Just doing some basic number crunching on DIA/SPY/QQQ vs. their 3X Index ETF counterparts.\n\nThese numbers are just for basic cash secured puts. One contract each ticker at 27DTE and -0.26 delta based on Fridays close (6/18/21) with the VIX sitting at 20.70.\n\nTL/DNR: One CSP on each ticker.\n\nDIA/SPY/QQQ requires $105,000 buying power reduction to collect $958 in premium, 0.91%\n\nUDOW/UPRO/TQQQ requires $25,400 buying power reduction to collect $705 in premium, 2.8%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems to me that using 1/4 of the buying power to gain 3X the rate of return is worth the risk.\n\nEven comparing a 20% drop in the underlying's the DIA/SPY/QQQ combo would lose $21K if assigned while the 3X UDOW/UPRO/TQQQ combo would lose $15K if assigned at a 3X 60% drop.\n\nI know there are better strategies than just selling cash secured puts on ETF index funds, but wanted to do the comparison just for my own education and to hear what the more experienced traders have to add.
