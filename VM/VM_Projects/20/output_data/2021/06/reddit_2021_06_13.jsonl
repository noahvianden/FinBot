Any money you spend hedging against a crash is money that isn't making you more profits now. However, it doesn't hurt to have some means to hedge against downturns. Options provide a good way to do this. However, often you need to more use stategies that limit loss in case of a downward drop rather than those that profit from a downward drop as that only generally works if you have a very good idea of when the drop will occur (ideally within a month) and how much the drop will be. If you know that, then something like [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/option-finder.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/option-finder.html) tells you exactly what put option or bullish spread to buy to maximize gains from the drop (naked calls are generally a very bad idea for most). Of course, if you are wrong, then you'll lose money, how much depends on how far the price drops. You can also simply close out positions you think will drop, but again, that's there's a cost there too, the opportunity cost of not having those positions.\n\nReally for the vast majority of long term investors, the goal is to ensure that you have the means to take advantage of any massive dip in price and buy at the discount, the prices generally go back up unless there is something fundamentally wrong with the company that has been revealed by the crash. There are plenty of recommendations online for how to buy the dip of crashes to gain from the recover, most of them related to using some percentage of your cash to buy more as the price drops in certain percentage intervals.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["crash"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation", "crash"]}
