If a company is trading at a P/E of 30 and grows earnings at 25% for the next 10 years, it will continue to have a P/E of 30 in 10 years.\n\nThis is of course assuming all else is equal. However, in the present economic environment, the biggest headwind we face is the possibility of rising interest rate (and correspondingly falling P/E multiples) over the next 5-10 years which will counteract the rise in earnings.\n\nSo the logical follow-up questions are:\n\nWill the growth in earnings more than offset the shrinking P/E multiple? And will the overall return on investment be adequate?\n\nIf the answer is yes to both these questions, it's a buy even if the stock is trading at a seemingly expensive price.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.05745904892683029}, {"body": "So, ignore the price when buying?

The point is not that you should \"buy at any price.\" It doesn't say that. It says that waiting years for a big price correction is not a strategy Buffett is a fan of.  If you think that is unclear, I am happy to revise it.\n\nI would note that just 15 months ago we lived through a dramatic price decline that offered great opportunities for investors. Smart ones seized that opportunity, but that doesn't mean they were wrong to buy great stocks pre-pandemic, even though the prices later declined.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Buffett is saying that we should be willing to pay a fair price (and get the return implied by that price, i.e., the discount rate in the intrinsic value calculation) instead of waiting for the company to be cheap\n\nIn my opinion this is unclear from what you've written. In your article it sounds like Buffett is saying, \"If you can find a great company, just buy it and don't worry about the price\"", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for pointing that out, u/100_PERCENT_BRKB. \n\nThe great lesson that Buffett learned from Charile Munger, that added to what he learned from Benjamin Graham, is not being afraid to pay a decent price for a great company, because great companies don't come cheap. This is what switched him from the \"Cigar Butt\" strategy to an approach that was more scaleable as Berkshire grew.\n\nMany years ago, I sat next to a very nice financial advisor at the Berkshire annual meeting and he told me that he had a client that had first alerted him to Berkshire and wanted his opinion on whether to buy it. He went and did his research and told his client, \"It's $4,000 a share! Let's wait until the price declines.\" At the time that we were speaking, the A shares were now well over $100,000. We both laughed about that. I have no idea whether his client would be laughing.\n\nOn the other hand, I usually run into an investor at the meeting every year who was from Hong Kong, and who for over 20 years would scrape and save all year long to buy one A share at the end of the year. Over the years, the price most years went higher and higher. He bought anyway. He is very rich!\n\nThe flipside of capricious investors caught up in speculative fever, are investors that become so hamstrung over price that they sit on the sidelines forever worried that they will miss out on a better price.  With Berkshire, we are talking about the epitome of the definition great company. Yet, even last March, when the B share price was around $170, I saw someone post that they were just waiting for a further price decline. How did that work out?\n\n(Note, I wouldn't treat the S&P 500 as a whole as if it was one great company, as it's a collection of companies at all different valuations, some of them outrageous. So, I wouldn't buy an S&P 500 index fund when the valuation goes into nose bleed territory.)\n\nBerkshire, thankfully, is a great company, with stellar managment, that tends to be fairly valued most of the time, and even sells at a great price every now and again. When it does, I buy as much as I can. The rest of the time, I'm comfortable paying the current valuation and adding to my position so I can be an ever larger co-owner of a truly great company.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Well, that guy (who wasn't willing to buy without clarity into what the company was worth, post-COVID) has a portfolio that is 97% Berkshire and 3% cash, after accumulating cash for 14 months.

But in general, you need to be careful what you buy (be clear on what it is worth, especially after huge, damaging events that change company value), and be careful what price you pay. The price you pay determines your long-term rate of return\n\nIf BRK.B were trading at $2900 today instead of $290, and all else was equal, how would that change your behavior? If BNSF became obsolete overnight, how would that change your behavior? If Berkshire incurred an unknown magnitude, $50-$100 billion insurance payout, how would that change your behavior?\n\nBuffett didn't build Berkshire by ignoring price and value.

(Heinz was at a better valuation, thankfully).\n\nBerkshire is so big and so diversified, that even these big writedowns are small when compared to the overall growth of the company.\u00a0\n\nThe growth of just the Apple position far eclipses the Precision Castparts write-down, and there are the 100% of earnings that are retained each year from Berkshire Hathaway Energy and BNSF, for example.\n\nBuffett has guessed wrong a number of times over the years. Remember when he made what he called a \"huge mistake\" on\u00a0\u00a0Tesco, or the TXU bonds?\n\nBerkshire's price is higher today because it reflects the powerful engine that the company as a whole is for generating and retaining earnings, in insurance, energy, transportation, pipelines, and many other areas.\n\n  \nSeveral years back, Buffett compared Berkshire to a forest, explaining that not every tree in a forest is healthy all the time, but that we've got a forest that is flourishing and growing larger.\n\n  \nDespite all the rampant speculation in the market right now, Berkshire is fairly valued at the moment, and its price doesn't reflect excessive speculation.\u00a0\n\nJust my opinion, and others may see its valuation differently.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Just want to say that this exchange is exactly why this sub is so great.

The same can be used to hedge vega.\n\nWhat you would do is find contracts that cancel out the amount of vega you want to hedge. As you're a theta trader you'd want to increase theta exposure. While delta may appear trivial to hedge (trade the underlying to reduce any increase in delta exposure), you are still susceptible to gamma. You can offset delta and gamma with even more contracts but at some point either your capital requirements are too high or you're paying too much in fees (I'm considering all trading costs as fees) to make it worthwhile. If you have a portfolio margin account then you will generally have lowered margin requirement as compared to a reg T margin account, but fees are still an issue for me anyway.\n\nEDIT: VIX is a good generic choice if you have high diversity in your portfolio.

However when trading vega it is perfectly acceptable and desirable to be long vega from time to time.

Rite Aid was the first partner that Amazon selected for its retail in-store pick-up program called Amazon Counter. Here is the link for the launch of the program:\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-rite-aid/amazon-launches-new-in-store-pickup-option-with-rite-aid-as-first-partner-idUSKCN1TS0RI](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-rite-aid/amazon-launches-new-in-store-pickup-option-with-rite-aid-as-first-partner-idUSKCN1TS0RI)\n\nSo the companies are already coordinating some business activities to a minor extent.\n\nFinally, with the acquisition of Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid became the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle, WA. Should Amazon buyout Rite Aid, AMZN itself would be able to cut out the middleman and provide cost effective prescription drug benefits to its 75,000 employees at the Seattle headquarters.\n\n**Walmart**\n\nWalmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.\n\nA couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:\n\nWalmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability\n\nAll the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.\n\nBased on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.\n\nThe Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.\n\nIf you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.\n\nWhichever company, Walmart or Amazon, utlimately decides to buy Rite Aid, that corporation will instantly become the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA, and will be well-positioned to someday challenge CVS and Walgreens for the #1 or #2 spots.\n\n**Walgreens**\n\nAnother darkhorse in this whole race is Walgreens. This week, Walgreens completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen for $6.5 billion (---see link below this paragraph). This windfall gives WBA the needed funds to finally finish the takeover of Rite Aid that it started back in 2015. While that deal was ultimately blocked by the courts, no judge could reasonably claim today that there is insufficent competition to support consumers if the balance of Rite Aid was taken over by Walgreens (NOTE: WBA bought 1,900+ RAD stores in 2018, and RAD currently has 2,500+ stores remaining). With CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger, and numberous mail order prescription services (including Amazon), there is pleny of competition in the USA.\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/walgreens-completes-divestiture-of-alliance-healthcare-to-amerisourcebergen-for-%246.5b-2021](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/walgreens-completes-divestiture-of-alliance-healthcare-to-amerisourcebergen-for-%246.5b-2021)\n\nAn acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens would be a highly strategic move accomplishing the following:\n\n\\- Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting WBA in a much more competitive position with CVS\n\n\\- Giving Walgreens a PBM in Rite Aid's Elixir group that would help WBA gain more prescription drug business share compete more successfully in that category\n\n\\- Blocking both Amazon ( $AMZN ) and Walmart ( $WMT ) from acquiring Rite Aid thereby removing the threat of a financially powerful competitor moving into the #3 retail pharmacy spot in the USA.\n\nSo, it may very well be the case, that the race is on to see who will acquire Rite Aid!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "The acquisition of RAD by WBA was already shut down years ago due to federal antitrust laws preventing WBA from becoming too monopolistic.
