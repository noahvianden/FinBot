{"title": "Rate my Portfolio: Dividend Investing", "selftext": "About me: \nRising second-year law student so I do not have time to get into day trading and intend on holding my portfolio LONG (25+ years). Am in a fortunate position to contribute between $100-300/month depending on discretionary spending. Also planning to contribute around $1,800 by the end of this summer from my summer legal job.\n\n\nCurrent Portfolio and percentage of total:\n\n\n* T       21.66%\n* BAC   20.27%\n* DIS    9.84%\n* PFE    9.64%\n* KO     9.16%\n* MSFT 5.47%\n* SBUX 4.83%\n* AAPL  4.62%\n* INTC  3.33%\n* PG     2.74%\n* MCD  2.36%\n* JNJ    2.04%\n* VZ     1.45%\n* GE     0.87%\n* TGT   0.88%\n* WFC  0.84%\n\nI'm obviously overweight in T and BAC but that's because I went for the 5% dividend yield on T and feel bullish on the financial banking sector. Because I'm extremely long, I will be buying whichever stock(s) on dips. \n\nMain Question:\nWhat are some solid dividend stocks in other industries that I could do my DD on? I do not know much about oil/industrial/standard utilities (minus telecommunications).\n\nThanks all!\n\n\n", "id": "6golmc", "created_utc": 1497223617.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "Some of the advice here is really bad, if you are looking long term for stable companies you need to look at the dividend champions.\n\n> Dividend Champions are companies which have increased their dividend for 25 or more consecutive years.
