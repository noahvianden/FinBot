KR, TGT, WMT, COST, ext. Well Kroger lowered guidance the day before as well, and there are other factors, but my point is its things like this that will determine where the stock goes. \n\nIf market sentiment changes in response to this buyout, maybe feeling its overblown, maybe another player will outbid, or any number or factors will determine the value of the stock. Costco could beat on next earnings, release good news, or the opposite could happen. I would look at the fundamentals of the company and decide for yourself if you think its going in the right direction. Look at its cash flow, balance sheet, and [look at everything else you can learn from its 10Q](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html). Most important, research the management of the company and decide if you like what they are doing more than their competition.\n\nThe fundamentals of the company will tell you which way the chart will be going long term, not a chart looking to the past.

Intel's Xeon family of server processors is a target for AMD.\n\n[...]\n\n>Analysts see the AMD market re-entry as a formidable move and sees competition rearing up for a response. Shane Rau, research vice-president, Computing Semiconductors at IDC, said: \u201cIt has a feel similar to April 2003 when AMD launched the Opteron range in April 2003. At that point they were pretty much where they are now, a re-entry, the new zero in terms of market share. There was a big validation and they got the major OEMs. This time, it seems as much or even more promising. It seems they are poised to a quick movement to some level of market-share.\u201c\n\n", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["intc", "amd"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "fuck I am at work right now. can't watch this", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08056899905204773}, {"body": "Thank you for calling out DCTH pump n dump", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14254488050937653}, {"body": "Whoah, love the video!
