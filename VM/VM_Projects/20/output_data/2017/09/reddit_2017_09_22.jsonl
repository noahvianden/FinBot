{"title": "Carmax up 7% post ER", "selftext": "This stock seems to be flying under everybody's radar. They are trading at a sub-20 P/E with a strong balance sheet, and the vast majority of their earnings coming from sales instead of financing. They're growing their locations at a pretty good pace, opening 3 stores this quarter on 180 total. More importantly, they achieved comparable store sales of 5.3% this quarter, on the back of 3.1% comps last year. Retail is all about comps and 5.3% is damn good.\n\nIf you want a quality used car, where do you go? Carmax. They're the dominant player in this field, and they have a business model that ensures quality for the customer. They make money in both good times and bad, and as they grow comparable sales, it only gets easier. This is also one area that is not going to get eaten by Amazon; online used car merchants are essentially a bullshit business model because cars are a big purchase and people who buy used cars 99% want to at least sit in the driver's seat first.\n\nI say there's probably 25-50% upside for this stock. It's not going to wipe out your losses from trading $RAD, but it's a strong long term play. The biggest risk to my thesis is probably a decline in the used car market due to autonomous vehicles or vertical integration as per Tesla. I don't really think that's going to happen, since new cars sales are doing fine and new cars eventually become used cars, and the usable lifespan of cars is always increasing.
