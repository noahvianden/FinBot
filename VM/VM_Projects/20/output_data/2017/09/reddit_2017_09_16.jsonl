It looks like these would all be longer term investments vs short term trades, so I'll take it as that.\n\nVTI: 43.68% -- this is good. You need some type of overall balance to the portfolio and a low cost index fund is a great way to achieve this.\n\nV: 8.65% -- I wish I was in visa still. I didn't appreciate the full story and I sold it around 75. It's had a heck of a run but I don't see a reason to sell. People are going to be using plastic more and more around the world.\n\nGOOG: 8.38% -- It's not my favorite tech company but I own some. It's one of those things where 2, 3, 4 years down the road will google be well over $1000? It should..\n\nAAPL: 7.33% -- This should be a staple in any portfolio. Don't sell it, just enjoy the profits that come with AAPL.\n\nFB: 6.25% -- This is my biggest position and has been since FB was around $70. I think you should look to increase this over time and not sell it unless something happens with the company. \n\nAMD: 5.7% -- I think this eventually hits $20. I have a small position in this (wish I had NVDA instead). Regardless, being a new name in the S&P should help its case for 20.\n\nDIS: 5.41% -- Blahhh. I own disney for my IRA and it's been a thorn in the side. Their brand is amazing but they can't seem to get ahold of ESPN. Eventually it's going to be fine and make new highs, that's what stocks tend to do. The question is, how long do you want to wait? I would consider this position dead money but I guess the plus side is they pay a dividend..? I wouldn't be surprised to see low 90s again. I'm not a seller down here, I'll be a buyer on a move under 90.\n\nMSFT: 4.85% -- I've missed this boat. It's been consistent since getting rid of Balmer. I'm sure it's a $100 stock eventually.\n\nT: 4.49% - I don't like telecoms. I think you can do better. Their dividend doesn't justify a competitive industry where customers expect more for less.\n\nDAL: 2.66% - I've never been a fan of airlines. I think they are a good industry to trade, both long and short. Long term, I'm sure they will do well, but you might as well just own the broad market for similar returns.\n\nMVIS: 2.62% - I don't follow this stock. Not the biggest fan of low priced stocks.\n\nIdeas...\nIf you're looking for a consistent dividend payer to replace T, check out MAIN.\nMAIN is essentially a play on the mid size business in America. They pay a monthly distribution and get their hands dirty by buying equity in companies and eventually selling their stake. They also loan out money to these companies. They cover their distribution handsomely and again, if you believe in the private America small business, this is a good play. Their price to book isn't the most attractive, but I think it's still an okay level to start a position in.\n\nI would look to increase positions in APPL and FB combine for > 20% of your portfolio.\n\nI think you need more financial exposure...\nBAC, JPM, GS, C -- all of these names look good and should be ripe for another move higher. Value is shifting higher in these names. I wouldn't be surprised to see JPM > 100, BAC moving towards 30, etc.\n\nAIG should do well and this should be a dip to buy - they just switched CEOs, changed up their strategy for pro-growth. It looked like they were about to breakout and then these hurricanes came through. I assume thats why the stock has been hit so much the past month. I think this is a good dip to buy under 60.\n\nI also think that you should have more healthcare exposure..\nI just started a new position in MRK (cost basis around 62). It looks like they are going to breakout to new highs here. I don't think it's too late but closer to 60 was definitely the time to buy. Check out ABBV, it just had a massive breakout.
