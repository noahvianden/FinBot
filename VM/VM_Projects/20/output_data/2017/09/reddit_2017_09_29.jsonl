{"title": "Covered call play question", "selftext": "[deleted]", "id": "73bp1b", "created_utc": 1506728959.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "You can sell anything you really want with a covered call. The risk is entirely in the stock, you're 100% hedged with the stock position against adverse movements *in the option*.\n\nYou have a menu of choices, how long until expiry, moneyness (are you selling ITM/ATM/OTM). Those things entail larger concepts.\n\nHere are basic trade-offs for trade length:\n\n* Longer DTE, more $$ return but potentially less % return when compounding is accounted for\n* Shorter DTE, less $$ return but potentially greater return when compounding is accounted for\n\nHere are basic trade-offs for moneyness:\n\n* Deep ITM, higher chance of being assigned at expiration in exchange for less return % and a cushion against stock price decline\n* ATM, highest return on option (not necessarily highest return overall) with a roughly 50/50 chance of assignment at expiration\n* OTM, highest return *potential* as stock appreciation and option premium combine. Still may be suboptimal when compared to just holding naked long stock\n\nI usually keep my covered calls between 21-60 days from expiration. I've done weeklies but I don't feel the risk is worth the reward. Time works in your favor with a short option but having time to adjust the trade is also an asset. The shorter the time to expiration the closer to a simple binary event the option becomes. The range of outcomes narrows (volatility plays an ever decreasing role) but as the outcome becomes closer and closer to a binary result the directional risk (delta, and the sensitivity of delta named gamma) increases by increasing magnitudes.\n\nWe can look at potential scenarios and then identify when is a good time to play a covered call.\n\nScenarios:\n\n* Very bullish stock\n* Bullish stock\n* Neutral stock\n* Slightly bearish stock\n* Bearish stock\n* Very bearish stock\n\nOf the above choices, if you're very bullish then a covered call is not a good play. If you're slightly bullish than an OTM covered call may be a good play with the intention of cost basis reduction. We can go down the line and say it's pretty good across all of the rest on down to bearish. At bearish, you would either sell a deep ITM covered call or just exit the position entirely. I would tend to just sell it rather than make the deep ITM covered call unless I wanted to simply exit the position and get commissions paid for--then I might sell a weekly that's deep ITM that would cover all transaction costs and just figure it takes a few days for the position exit.\n\nAnyway, YMMV but that's been my practice. Covered calls are a great learning tool and when used properly can both reduce risk and increase chances of success. However, it's not free money. You are giving up the chance at greater returns in exchange for guaranteed income. Also, you enter the contract knowing that you might sell a call and find out the company is being bought out and you will only participate up to the strike price. As you own the stock, you still participate in dividends as long as you're the owner of the stock on the ex-div date. You can easily \"double the dividends\" on blue-chip stocks. It's a pretty conservative play overall and reduces the directional risk a bit in a long stock position. For instance, if you sell the 30-delta call like others have suggested you would reduce your directional impact at that moment from 100-delta long to a net 70-delta long.\n\nI hope some of this might help out.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I've been thinking about setting up a bullish debit call spread on a stock I am long in, in which I buy a call option slightly OTM and sell a covered call that's further OTM.

If you're selling a 10-delta over top of that you're going to be paying about $0.10 of the appreciation of that first dollar for a net $0.20 of the $1.00 gain.\n\nYour risk in terms of intrinsic value is reduced a lot in your case but it seems like an expensive trade with not a lot of chance of being a really \"good\" trade, e.g. reward/risk is small in exchange for small capital outlay--low risk, low reward.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.40609031915664673}, {"body": "If you buy a call option the call you sell is covered already, so you don't need to have 100 shares of the stock.

Do you roll them at 50% gain, or let it expire and re-open?\n\nI opened a few 37 strike covered calls in MU, and it went up to $39.33 last week after earnings. Should I wait and just let it exercise, or roll it up for a realized loss? ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "With a covered call, there are variables I use to determine what I'm doing.\n\nI don't mess with covered calls over earnings, so that's a hard stop for me. I will end the trade and go elsewhere with the money. Sometimes I roll at 50% but TBH that's not really my style with a covered call. I already know it's not a pure option play. My risk in the option is really non-existent so it's more a function of return vs time. If I make huge gains in a short period of time (if we imagine a glide path to 100% gains) then I'll close the short option. I sometimes use 50% if it's a core position that I'm intending to continue to hold. Another rule I might use if I'm selling a 1-month call is to close it if 80% of the initial sale price is burned off in the first 3-weeks and close it at 90% in the final week.\n\nWhen it comes to your specific situation, it's really just math. If you still have a significant amount of time value, you can compare that to rolling out to the same strike with some downside protection. Keep in mind that the option you're holding will be burning extrinsic value faster than whatever you roll out to. If you roll out and up, you need to be very bullish on the stock because you can put more cash into the trade and watch that stock come right back down and put you into a loss where you once had a max gain return.\n\nIn any case, don't freak out just because it breached your strike. You can look at what rolling up in the same month may bring in. Sometimes if it moves hard and fast enough, you'll be able to bring in extra time value and still capture a substantial portion of the up-move. You just have to do the math on it and be comfortable with the stock.\n\nAnother play, let the thing go to expiration day and have a plan formulated by the night before for what you're going to do and then make your moves closing and opening a new position on that day.

Assigned return is what you are talking about in \"If it does end up getting exercised, you still earn $200 from the capital gain of 13.5 - 12.5 , as well as the premium for selling the call? \"\n\nOf the 2, assigned return is actually the maximum return you can get on a Covered Call and unless you really LOVE that stock and cannot live without it, assigned return is really what most Covered Call writers are going for!

In fact, I LOVE assigned return especially if the stock goes upwards really quick and the position gets assigned BEFORE expiration.

{"title": "Byron Wien: Bull Market Has 2 Years or More", "selftext": "The veteran investment strategist writes that the \u201cusual factors that warn of a bear market or recession are not evident.\u201d\n\nIn my conversations with institutional investors I find a surprising lack of optimism about the outlook for equities. The capitalization-weighted Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 was up over 11% year-to-date, excluding dividends, on September 18. Some would argue that only a few stocks are accounting for the rise, but the equal-weighted S&P 500 was up over 8% year-to-date as well. Everyone is aware that the economic expansion and the bull market have continued for a long time. Equities bottomed in March of 2009 and the economy began to strengthen in June of that year, so we have been in a favorable period for investing for more than eight years.\n\nCycles usually do not last this long. We all know it can\u2019t go on forever, but I believe we could continue on a positive course for both the economy and the market for several more years.\n\nThe principal reason for this conclusion is that the usual factors that warn of a bear market or recession are not evident. I think we will have a favorable environment for equities at least until 2019. I think we will have a favorable environment for equities at least until 2019. What would really worry me would be an inverted yield curve, but there is now almost an eighty basis point spread between the two-year Treasury and the ten-year. I would also be concerned if retail investors were euphoric about equites as they were in 1999 or 2007. They are generally optimistic, but not excessively so, although earlier this year sentiment did rise to a worrisome level. Investors large and small are also leaning toward the defensive.\n\nHedge fund net exposure clearly shows a mood of caution: it is just under 50% now; it was mostly 55%\u201360% in the 2000\u20132008 period. Individuals are still buying bond funds even at these low yields because of their lack of confidence in the stock market. Institutions, in their desperate search for yield, have bid up the price of lower-quality bonds to the point where their spread with Treasuries is historically low. Warnings of trouble ahead, however, would usually be associated with high spreads. Maybe investors are too complacent, but not this may not be the case if the economy continues to grow.\n\nWe know that the Federal Reserve was considering an additional increase in the federal funds rate in September, but was discouraged from taking any action by hurricanes Harvey and Irma. The planned shrinkage of the Federal Reserve balance sheet was probably also delayed for the same reason. The S&P 500 has also shown a tendency to peak after each rate increase by the Federal Reserve and we have only begun the tightening cycle now. The hurricanes are likely to reduce third-quarter real GDP growth by at least one-half of one percent, but demand driven by rebuilding should be reflected positively in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2018.\n\nAnother important warning signal is the Leading Indicator Index, which has been climbing steadily since 2016. Recent data shows the possibility of a growth slowdown but a continuation of the expansion. The slowdown, if it comes, may trigger a correction in the equity market, but the present steep slope of this indicator suggests nothing more serious than that. Based on this data, even when the Index tops out, we would still have as long as two years for the market to work its way higher before the downturn begins. Corporate earnings are still increasing and there has never been a recession while that is happening.\n\nStrong business activity exists not only in the United States, but throughout the world: Europe should grow at close to 2% this year; so will Japan. The rates for China, and India will be close to 7%. The U.S. will benefit from continued strength in these key areas. One condition that invariably appears before a recession is an increase in cyclical spending as a percentage of GDP. This indicator has exceeded 28% before every recession going back to 1970 but is only at 24% now. Perhaps there is a secular shift in spending patterns toward non-cyclical services rather than goods that accounts for the drop, but we still should expect a pick-up in cyclical spending before the end of the cycle. Another factor dampening capital spending is that operating rates are only 77%. There is plenty of slack capacity and no great need for new plant and equipment.\n\nThe market has clearly responded favorably to the election of Donald Trump last November. Aside from his pro-growth agenda, he promised to bring a more business-friendly attitude to Washington. His failure to get any of his major initiatives passed through Congress has been a disappointment and one would think the market\u2019s response to that would be negative. What has neutralized the lack of progress on his agenda is the better current performance of the economy itself, notwithstanding any boosts it might get from his agenda of tax reform, decreased regulation and infrastructure spending. Real growth in the U.S. is headed toward 3% and the economy seems to be gaining momentum rather than slowing down, as it usually does in the second half of a business cycle. Moreover, there is reasonable prospect of deregulation at the administrative level.\n\nWhile the Trump administration appears to be off to a slow start on legislation, most investors believe that there will be a reduction in corporate taxes by the end of 2017 or early next year and other aspects of Trump\u2019s agenda will be passed in 2018. The recent deal to lift the debt ceiling and temporarily keep the country running was viewed as an indication of Trump\u2019s flexibility, his negotiating skill and his willingness to act in opposition to some key Republican leaders to get a necessary piece of legislation done. The question is whether his strained relationship with important members of his party will make it difficult to get other parts of his program implemented. My guess is that we will definitely see a tax cut, but probably not broad tax reform; continued deregulation, particularly in industries like energy and finance; and infrastructure spending, stimulated by rebuilding as a result of Harvey and Irma. Most of this, however, will happen next year.\n\nThe hurricanes pushed North Korea off the front pages of newspapers across the country, but the market had begun to scale back its fear of Kim Jong-Un even before the storms. There may be two reasons for that. The first is that Kim has achieved his objective of getting North Korea viewed as an important country at least militarily. He will never give up his nuclear arsenal, since he knows it will discourage any outside threats. The second is that while Kim is impetuous, unpredictable, and even homicidal, he is not, as Tom Friedman has pointed out, suicidal. He demonstrated this when he threatened to hurl an intercontinental ballistic missile at Guam and then backed off, sending the missile into the northern Pacific Ocean instead. He knows that any unprovoked attack by North Korea involving the loss of life of innocent people would cause China to abandon Kim and be met with instant and massive U.S. retaliation, endangering the North Korean population and his family\u2019s regime. Sanctions have had an impact on his already weak economy. An increase in sanctions, particularly by China, could be devastating, but that is not likely to happen, so we will have to hope that Kim\u2019s truculence quiets down on its own. Containment is the most likely U.S. policy. If I am right and he has achieved the respect he seeks, perhaps that will happen, although the harsh rhetoric and threats are likely to continue.\n\nThere is always the risk of a policy mistake out of Washington that negatively changes the mood of the market. The departure of Steve Bannon as the administration\u2019s chief strategist and the arrival of John Kelly as chief of staff have been viewed positively by investors. The chance of a poorly reasoned decision on trade or foreign policy has diminished. The two potential trouble spots on trade are China and NAFTA. Trump continues to believe that China is dealing in an unfair way with the United States and he wants to change that. He must realize, however, that China is a key supplier of component parts for many items assembled in America as well as a producer of goods no longer made here. He must view the country as a trading partner and not an adversary. While he can fairly be tough on intellectual property and tariffs, he should not let the relationship become hostile. With regard to NAFTA, the agreement can be improved through modification, but scrapping it would be unwise. I believe that\u2019s the position that Wilbur Ross, Steve Mnuchin and Gary Cohn will take, and they are the key players here. Trump has shown a willingness to shift toward modification rather than termination in the Iran deal.\n\nMany investors are concerned about an increase in inflation in view of the tight labor market that has resulted from the low level of unemployment and the monetary expansion that began in 2008 and continued until last year. As Milton Friedman famously said, \u201cInflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.\u201d Friedman is no longer around to answer to his fellow economists as to why his pronouncement is no longer accurate. The combination of globalization and technology have worked together to keep inflation low. The highly respected and closely watched Phillips curve no longer has predictive value. It would argue that inflation should be moving up because of low unemployment. We had a similar circumstance in 1999 when the Federal Reserve decided to raise interest rates by a quarter point in spite of a lack of evidence that inflation was rising. They kept raising rates and by May of 2000 the federal funds rate was 6\u00bd%, up from 4\u00be% in June 1999, thereby contributing to the bear market we experienced at that time when the technology bubble burst. They are not likely to make the same mistake again.\n\nThe Bank Credit Analyst (BCA) has identified some other indicators that could provide an early warning on inflation. They include personal consumption expenditures, the producer price index for finished goods, the Institute for Supply Management Manufacturing Prices Paid and the Corporate Prices Paid deflator. Only the finished goods indicator looks troubling now. In that connection, BCA also has found money velocity a useful indicator of future inflation, and this looks like it could be signaling a problem at some point in the near future.\n\nAlthough the hurricanes may have put the Fed on hold in terms of increasing interest rates, we will likely see some hikes next year. The current yield of intermediate-term Treasurys will also likely rise. The combination of a better economy, a rising stock market and a tighter Fed should mean a stronger dollar, but that is not how the currency has performed this year. There are, however, some benefits from the dollar\u2019s decline. The European Central Bank is less likely to taper, American exports are attractively priced and foreign earnings of U.S. companies are worth more. I expect the dollar to remain around present levels or strengthen against the euro over the near term and not be a factor in the performance of the equity market.\n\nStill, there are plenty of other issues to worry about. There could be a jam in the Exchange Traded Funds market as a flood of investors rush to get out of specific ETFs at the same time. There are loans outstanding made by marginal companies that would have difficulty paying principal or even interest in a business downturn. The Chinese shadow banking system has a number of non-performing loans on its balance sheet. As long as the Chinese economy is thriving, these may not be a problem but they do represent a potential risk. The U.S. economy is doing well now, but the prosperity is very unevenly distributed. Large areas of the mid-west are struggling and we all should be on the lookout for signs that the economic cycle is topping.\n\nThere is always much to worry about and the investment business requires money managers to weigh the variables and make a judgment. Based on my analysis, I think we will have a favorable environment for equities at least until 2019. I will, however, be watchful for changes in the conditions that brought me to that conclusion.\n\nWien is vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners, a subsidiary of the Blackstone Group.\n\nhttp://www.barrons.com", "id": "738j9l", "created_utc": 1506698844.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "I remember back in 2000 how many analysts were talking about how the tech stock bull market was going to continue another 5 years, easy.
