It was called Disneylife and launched in the UK in 2015.\n\nWhat if I told you Disney teamed up with several other television studios a decade ago to build a Netflix competitor and still hasn't been able to scrape together 20 million paid subscribers? They did. It's called Hulu. It's extremely unprofitable. New TV shows are expensive and online ads earn pennies compared to traditional ad dollars. \n\nAmazon Prime relied on free shipping to amass their subscriber numbers. Netflix relied on their DVD subscribers to build their streaming base. Disney is going to have to bundle their streaming service with something similar if they have any shot at getting 30 million subscribers. Maybe they bundle it with every disneyland ticket. Or maybe they try to bundle it with every disney movie ticket. It's not impossible, just improbable. Especially since they won't even be launching this service until 2019.\n\nWouldn't it just be easier to license content to Netflix? I think this is just a negotiating ploy from Disney to get more money from Netlflix. It doesn't make sense for them to start their own streaming service.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "What if I told you at this point it's not about Tech, it's about Content.
