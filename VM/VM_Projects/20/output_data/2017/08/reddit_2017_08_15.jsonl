They don't own most their stuff and if you take it away how much are they really worth? They are starting to create a lot of value with the stuff they do own but whether that justifies its premium price is questionable. With that being said, they have so many eyes watching their stuff that it has become a utility for people now. No one is going to cancel their subscription even if the price does go up a few $ or if they lose some shows. $10 a month is such a great value for the hours and days of entertainment people get out of it. Also, I think they will still have some form of partnership with Disney going forward even if it means paying extra.

It's appealing to retail investors because it's such a simple concept, but because of it's simplicity it also is a terrible metric to use on growth stocks that demand more sophisticated analysis methods like DCFs.
