{"title": "18 y/o sharing investing situation looking for opinion on current position", "selftext": "So I was given 5,000 dollars to trade with on a Just2Trade account that was given to me by my dad in his name when I was younger. I invested it and now however many years later I have 12,000 dollars. 87% of it is in $APPL, 8% of it is in $WMT, and %4 of it is in a company I believe in for the long term: $ZKIN. I had $2500 in a safe in my room and recently have gotten back into researching stocks so my dad matched my $2500 and deposited $5000 into the account the other day. When the check goes through I will have $5000 in funds available for trading and a value of $17,000 in my account. I know I have way too much of my portfolio invested in apple right now and that I should sell a chunk of my shares in it to use in investing in other companies and diversify my portfolio a lot more. At the end of this post I will leave a list of stocks that I have created that I think I will invest in. I am looking for opinions on what I should do with my investments because I am relatively new and unknowledgeable when it comes to valuing companies and trading in the market. Also I was wondering if I should switch all of my stocks and investing money from Just2Trade over to RH (the app that gives you a stock for free). RHood has 0 fees. So basically Just2Trade vs RobinH? I guess that is it... I have been avidly researching stocks and reading this sub and others to try and grow my knowledge on investing. Any tips/opinions or links to educational investing books/videos/articles would be GREATLY appreciated. \n\nHere are my stock picks so far that I think I will invest in. Share your opinions on them or share stocks that you think I should consider investing in that are not on this list:\n$AMZN Amazon\n$MSFT Microsoft\n$MU Micron\n$STZ Constellation Brands Inc\n$WEED.TO Canopy Growth\n$ACB.TO Aurora Cannabis inc\n$0700.HK Tencent Holdings Limited\n$TTWO Take-Two Interactive Software Inc\n$ATVI Activision Blizzard Inc\n$EA Electronic Arts Inc\n$HD Home Depot\n$V Visa\n$FB Facebook\n$NVDA Nvidia\n$WM Waste Management\n$LMT Lockheed Martin Corporation\n$BA The Boeing Company\n$AMID (because of dividend) (not sure if good)\n$GWRE Guidewire (not sure if good)\n$ZNGA (not sure if good)\n\n\nPlease share your advice, opinions and thoughts.

{"title": "\"Sector Rotation\" Overstated (Long Tech) - Play Smart", "selftext": "So a month or so ago the media scared everyone into thinking tech was going to crash, and every other sector was going to enter paradise...except none of it ever materialized.\n \n\nTech is still the #1 bullish sector going to into 2018 simply because it demonstrates capacity of high earnings growth (20% or more/year). My educated guess is financials come in at #2 and consumer discretionary #3. \n \n\n\"Sector rotation\" is a misnomer because what really happened was investors, or at least the intelligent ones, realized many tech stocks were overvalued, and switched to boring value stocks left in the dust over the past couple years. But the numbers are catching up already.\n \n\nExamples:\n \n\n1) Bank of America was trading around $22 early this year, but finally caught up to its intrinsic value (around $28-30), using DCF calculation.  \n  \n2) Foot Locker, a company many left for dead, bounced from $28 to $40+ recently (wow, almost $50 now!) after its earnings report proved it was still a worthy contender in retail. It is unlikely to go up much further at this point and may even fall when people are reminded retail is in steady decline.   \n\n3) AT&T, a blue chip with stable net income/sales and very little future growth, has bounced back after being oversold in the low 30's. It's priced near perfection, which means the dividend should be your primary motive for investment (and not the company's long term prospects), although since most of you aren't anywhere close to retiring, I fail to see the point in doing so. 5% paltry returns suck!\n \n\nJust to be clear, the smart money saw this coming from a mile away, and were loading on non-techs back in June. So rotating out of tech at this point is, to be frank, an utterly stupid move, and you're better off holding/averaging down before the inevitable rebound skyrockets the best players forward for another excellent year. If tech has outperformed every sector for the past 5-7 years, I see no reason why the next year would yield a different outcome. \n\n(I know: \"But, but, what about the tax bill?!!111\" Already priced in.)\n\nDon't listen to the nonsense and gibberish - I remember when people were screaming about how \"Facebook fell flat on its IPO, it must be a bad stock!!\" on the financial news media back in 2012.
