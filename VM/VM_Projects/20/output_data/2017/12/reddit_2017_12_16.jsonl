{"title": "$DIS: Is it too late to buy?", "selftext": "So with Disney acquiring Fox content, how many tons of upside are left here?\n\n- also Disney will make their own streaming channel, to compete against Netflix's variety of offerings with their own Star Wars, and Marvel, and other kids stuff, etc.  Basically it will be the streaming channel for manchildren.  How will Netflix, who has been doing this for years, compete?\n\n- with Fox Sports becoming part of the Disney family, basically now we've got a bunch of regional ESPN's, which were filled with ESPN rejects.  I think this means at least twice as much ESPN for Disney to profit from.  What an acquisition.\n\n- the only thing I'm worried about is theme parks.  I mean what if someone makes a VR experience of Disneyland, so you can experience the rides and doll interactions, without waiting in line out in the hot California/Florida sun?  That will probably be a lot cheaper for a family of 4.

The company has over 3 billion in debt, made negative cash flow over the past five years, and really isn't holding up well against it's competitors. Not only has Netflix just increased monthly subscription, but it has also just been announced that by 2019 Disney will have removed all of their content from the platform. With Amazon also becoming relevant in the film industry, the future doesn't look very optimistic for Netflix. \n\nDisney, however, is looking like an especially good investment with the acquisition of 21st Century Fox. It is hard to slap a value on Disney just yet until everything is in the financials, but this aside, it looks like a smart investment. I wouldn't worry about the theme parks either. . . they aren't going anywhere.\n\nA caution I would definitely take with investing in any media company is the Net Neutrality controversy. In all likelihood, the repeal Net Neutrality won't happen and everything will eventually settle down. The news is thriving off of this issue, but in reality, checks and balances between state and federal government will be a road block for the FCC and lawsuits will drive this fight for years at least --with nothing actually happening. Either way, the market reacts strangely to prospects like these and the majority of media/telecommunications stocks are very liable to volatility. \n\nTl;dr - Disney is a good investment, Netflix is a bad investment, be careful though because the market is going to be irrational during Net Neutrality conflict.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "nflx"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Lifetime stock", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1579962968826294}, {"body": "Nothing to worry about, Disneyland parks will never be replaced, esp. not by VR people don\u2019t just go there for the rides, the overall feeling of the place is magical.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5215963125228882}, {"body": "Government might try to step in and block this though", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1677100956439972}, {"body": "Let's face it.
