The trader then used those proceeds to buy a VIX 1\u00d72 call spread, which involves buying 262,000 October contracts with a strike price of 15 and selling 524,000 October contracts with a strike price of 25.

I bought 10 SPY call (paid 0.55) this morning around 9:45 thinking that it would go up, but I was wrong. Losing that amount so quickly sucked, obviously, but it's all good, I moved on and I'm now even more motivated to learn. \n\nI had been playing with paper money for about a month before I finally decided to place a real trade. I had a plan and I sticked to it but I'm convinced now that I probably had no idea what I was doing. I set my stop loss at about 0.43/contract and it triggered about 15 minutes later. (suprisingly at 0.39, I'm a bit puzzled about that, could it be because I'm using 15 mins delayed market data or does that not matter?).\n\nI chose SPY because this is pretty much the only security I can afford (I only have 2000$) that has a small bid-ask spread and that is very liquid. I'm sure there are more of these but I don't know them yet. I have no intention of swing trading (at least not for now, the after-hours volatility scares me a bit). When I'll have more capital, I'd love to trade the big names like AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN and TSLA but for now I'll stick to cheaper ones.\n\nWith all of that being said, if you guys could share some thoughts in regards to the above I'd greatly appreciate. For instance, I'm looking for key mistakes that I've made or paramount things that I may have missed.\n\nAlso, I'm aware of more advanced \"delta-neutral\" techniques such as credit spreads and condors but it's a bit too advanced for me and I'd like to start with simple directional plays.

I have been trading options for a couple of months now and I have learnt a few things that might help others out there, many might disagree but its worked so far me:\n\n1. Stay small and consistent. 10 contracts on the SPY for a $2K account is a bit too much, 4-5 bad trades could wipe your account out which you don't want happening.\n\n2. Setting stop losses is not optimal for options. I've seen option value swing from -100% to +20% in a manner of days. For this reason, by staying small and being comfortable with the max loss as your max loss, no stop loss is required as you are comfortable with losing what you have put in.\n\n3. Straight holding options gives you unlimited profit, but at a cost of negative theta. Buying calls will be fine if the stock shoots in your direction but you will be affected by the erosion that time has if it doesn't. Which is why I recommend selling strategies like credit spreads.\n\n4. Credit Spreads like a vertical put or call spread could give you the directional play that you want whilst limiting your losses (they are defined risk trades) but also limiting your profits.
