{"title": "life changes and new interest in investing", "selftext": "Hello Reddit!\n\nI am looking for some advice. My wife of 2 years and I are about to have our first child! I recently started looking into investing, she mentioned that she has a Scotttrade account her dad use to manage for her that was created from a couple Roth IRA\u2019s she had when she first started working. He passed about 18 months ago. We recovery the login information and she has almost 2,000 in a mutual fund called YACKX that is performing well. We would like to leave this money here because this is her father\u2019s investment for her and has a lot of sentimental value. We have another $6,000 that is sitting in funds available for trading. \n\nKeeping in mind, we are recently married, still paying off student loans and about to have our first child.  I am reaching out for financial advice. I have been doing a ton of research and have decided I want to invest in some growth stocks that will earn money over time and are relatively. I was thinking about splitting our money on PSI and PPA but am up for feedback and other tips on how to spend about $6000. These ETFs would offer us many shares in sectors that I think will profit in the future. I was initially thinking about more diversity but with the Scottrade fee, I might just split the amount in two trades for now. \n\nI\u2019m also up for other possibilities and advice like taking out the money and using it to pay off debt from student loans, our home, car, wedding credit card debt. Moving the account to a different company, investing in mutual funds (looks like zero fee for this on Scottrade), and even opening up a college fund for our about to be born son. We have been working out paying down our debts are are looking into debt consolidation also. If you have any advice with that I would be very interested.\n\nWe both have retirement funds at a youngish age and have saved up a fair amount about 20,000 each. We net a few hundred dollars each month after our paychecks that normal get put into an emergency fund. However, we have been buying baby stuff and just paid for a major vet bill and have little accessible savings. \n\nLet me know if you need any more information and thank you in advance!\n", "id": "7blla2", "created_utc": 1510150838.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "S&P 500 index fund from a low fee broker like Schwab or Vanguard. \n\nYou will need to remember that there's no such thing as sentimentalism in investing, when going forward.

This money has already been set aside by the OP in an investment account so he is committed to long term investments with the funds and there is very little risk of him reinvesting from the IRA in long term growth ETFs himself. The advantage for him with ETF investing is that he gets exposure to some of the better performing stocks without having the money to invest in the individual stocks directly and it is a very quick way to diversify his portfolio. I would recommend he considers initially investing in growth dividend ETFs so that he can reinvest the dividend payouts while the market is in this bull run. \n\nFor OP, are your wife's IRAs the only retirement accounts the two of you currently have? If so, I would recommend that you keep them and contribute to them annually rather than withdrawing the funds and moving them to a private market account. If you are considering moving those funds to mutual funds you need to also consider that a mutual fund will charge you annual maintenance fees even if there are not transfer fees involved. If you have a separate IRA through your employer or elsewhere and want to try your hand in the market I would look into transferring the funds into a private account that you can manage yourself. \n\nI was \"new\" to the financial world when I started up my own trading account last year, and in my first year I have earned a 25% return on my account managing it myself. I have a full time job that is not in finance and still have been able to achieve this return through swing trading and managing risk. I did spend a year paper trading and developing a strategy before going live with my account, so if you count that time then I am two years into it and this has been a bull market so that has made things \"easier\" for me as well.
