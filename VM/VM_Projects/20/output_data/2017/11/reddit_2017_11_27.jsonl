The last time it sold off on earnings, it fell all the way to the 200-day moving average, which was then $9.50 or something. The last earnings, it broke every moving average so looking at the charts you didn't have that reference to identify the bottom. \n\nI think AMD's a great entry stock for trading. As volatile as it is, it's still a large cap stock in the S&P 500 and it's nothing compared to the microcaps. For these 1B+ valuation companies, they behave according to momentum indicators like RSI fairly predictably when they read 'oversold', bouncing off the main moving averages which act as support and resistance (you want to look at the 20 day, 50 day, 100 day, and 200 day moving averages). \n\nRight now it's kind of meh. AMD broke above and held the 20 day moving average which is bullish. If it retraces to 11.30 on low selling volume and you buy there, it's a 'safer' entry. The important thing is you want to get into the habit of setting profit targets and scaling out. For example if you bought 500 shares sell 250 at 12.00 (a ton of profit-taking and resistance there earlier) and the rest at 12.40-12.50 (or wherever the 50 day moving average is). Which is what my plan would be if I was still playing AMD. Let's say you saw the future and know AMD will hit $15 by the end of Q1. I don't think it'd be worth holding for that long. \n\nDon't hold and sell 100% of shares at a single profit target. This is something a lot of traders do and what I did at the start, and am still guilty of doing. I bought at 10.80 and didn't sell at 12.00, then bearish news came out and I only got to sell at 11.30,. 5% for 4-5 days, it's not worth it. It take longer than you think to get to hit that 'ideal' profit target, or never get there.

I think going for the 'base hits' rather than the home runs is how you keep growing your money and keep it active. I have had two or three 25% trades but most of mine are 7.5%-12.5%. A few 5.5%, a few 15-20%, several where I sold flat, or was negative small. 3 really bad trades I lost 20%, but those only set me back a total of maybe 7 winning trades. \n\nMy point is, those base hits add up. Right now, I think it's more important you develop a strong grasp of the fundamentals. Start off looking at the 'big picture' of technical analysis; support and resistance trendlines, moving averages. Then look at candlesticks - the important ones in my experience are the hammer, inverted hammer, hanging man, gravestone and dragonfly dojis appearing at the bottom of a downtrend or top of an uptrend (reversal signals). Study volume to confirm trends. \n\nStart being able to identify the chart patterns. Sometimes you won't get an obvious entry on a moving average support. But you'll see a cup and handle pattern start to develop like AMD did when it found support at 10.80. \n\nThat stuff is important for determining exit points. For example, you're in a stock and you're watching as it rises toward a resistance point. If it looks like it's going to fail to break it and drop down, you want to sell. Being able to identify a rising wedge pattern, and put that together with indicators like RSI, and volume, will allow you to say \"There's a higher chance of this being rejected at x price, so I'm going to be more ready to sell.\" \n\nEventually this stuff comes together and you can just start to get on a roll and buy a stock, have it pop 10% the next day, move onto the next one, have it pop in the next two days etc. That'll be worth more than if AMD doubled tomorrow and you sold for 100% gain\n\nAnd also, a lot of this comes down to your mentality and discipline. You may not have a margin account yet - use this opportunity to test your patience. Things like that people don't always talk about are incredibly important. \n\nIf you have a trade that's not moving like you expected - can you just sell and be okay waiting through the T+2 settlement. Do you feel impatient or frustration of having to wait and be restricted by broker and regulatory limitations, or by seeing the stock you didn't choose but also thought would run, run while you're stuck waiting for funds to settle? That's something I still deal with. I started earlier this year with 5k and even though I ran it up a decent amount % wise (52%), it's not enough for a margin account due to my broker being my employer and them being behind the times. That's a reality for me that I still get pissed about, but have to accept for the near future and can't allow to affect my trading or the consequences will be disastrous. The times I didn't get patient and tried to force it or rush into trades, is why I'm only up 52% and not 100% like I was before.
