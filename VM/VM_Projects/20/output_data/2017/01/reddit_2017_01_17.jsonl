But, obviously with Trump and his administration, that will not happen in the next 4 years, so with out elaborating, we're basically fucked. And here's the thing, even if that did happen and we were able to install a ridiculous amount, say 50% of our grid renewable in 10 years, we still have the problem of needing non intermittent power, and as you said, vehicles. So realistically natty gas is not going away for a while, because ever since  the deregulation of the utilities so that they aren't guaranteed a ROI, it's all about cheap quick builds which natty gas excels at. If you know anything about elec. generation, and care about the environment, it's undeniable that nuclear should be used for that non-intermittent source. But, that will never happen for the aforementioned reason and the fact that the majority of the public doesn't understand how nuclear energy works (basically because of fossil fuel propaganda), and anything the public is against obviously politicians won't do.

Just trying to score some points for the home team, but you are right ", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">issue a carbon tax. If we did this, these two decade changes you're talking about are going to come a lot faster\n\nEh, possibly, but only if you tax carbon to ridiculous levels that would make driving a car Hong Kong level expensive (think $6-10/gallon), which doesn't really work super well in the US. The reason for that is that while implementing a carbon tax helps push out coal because coal is just so dirty, natural gas burns relatively cleanly, so the effect of a carbon tax on natural gas is much, much lower. For every dollar of tax levied on Coal, you levy probably 60 cents on oil and 40-50 cents on natural gas. So it takes double the tax or more to force out natural gas, which then can have some pretty severe effects on gas prices, which is important because high gas prices in an extremely spread out country has had some pretty poor precedent (see: 1980s America when OPEC cut production). The economic effect of that could be potentially devastating. The only real solution that can work economically is continuing subsidies for renewables or increasing them and throwing money into things like carbon capture or recapture and praying for a technological advance.\n\n>say 50% of our grid renewable in 10 years, we still have the problem of needing non intermittent power, and as you said, vehicles\n\nYep. Sucks, but that's reality. Again, probably why we need to progress past just renewables and reduction of impact into reversal of impact via carbon recapture. Of course, that's a technological order of magnitude away.\n\n>But, that will never happen for the aforementioned reason and the fact that the majority of the public doesn't understand how nuclear energy works \n\nI mean, yeah, that, and the huge financial issues with nuclear (expensive, takes forever to build and get production out of, much more expensive to shut down), and the reality that while accidents are extremely rare, they're also extremely visible in terms of media attention and forming long lasting opinions. \n\nI'm fairly confident that things will change - either we will end up with significant advances in renewables, or we'll invent something to capture the CO2 we've fucked the atmosphere up with, or something else entirely - but that doesn't mean we shouldn't be throwing money at a solution as a nation. It might take some truly dire circumstances to kick that into action, though.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "\n\nAlthough I really hate to admit this fact, because as an environmentalist it's just a goody old dream to have our earth run purely on the wind and sun, you're right in the fact that we're going to need to put a lot of RnD  into 'sucking the carbon out of the atmosphere' so to speak, or capturing it before it exists a plant. I wish it didn't come to this but, at this point we basically have to start it. I mean there are techs that do both of those things, but they're in that beginning super expensive and rare phase. \n\nAlso, the thing with nuclear power (and I could go on for days about this subject), but bottom line is it's super expensive to build up front, but the costs of actually running it are so low. Not to mention (especially with the tech we have available nowadays) the lifespan of a nuclear plant crushes natty gas. Lastly, considering the long term costs associated with climate change, its kind of hard not to justify the short term price differential. And to think, the ST costs could be fixed if utilities were guaranteed ROI like they were back in the day. Because then it was about making the best most reliable, long term power (nuclear). Now it's about how can we build the cheapest plant upfront to get the quickest money back in our pockets (natty gas). It's whack. Thinking about these topics always make me mad. I wish I could have my dad spew some knowledge here, he's worked in the nuclear power industry for 40 years, he's a programmer who writes the flux programs. He could be much more articulate with this, I can really just say the general gist. \n\nEDIT: didn't address what you said about a carbon tax bc all I was really going to say is 'majority of economists believe a carbon tax is the most effective way to mitigate climate change while experiencing the least severe economic losses', and that was basically it. But looking back, I should have. Because economists believe this in majority for a reason. Just as you said, a carbon tax will levy 40-60 cents on a dollar as coal per tons of CO2 avoided. That's why it is integrated across society in a staggered manner. As you said when the tax will be low it will not effect natty gas as much. It's a matter of, 'is it more efficient to abate CO2 emissions or is it more efficient to pay the tax'. For natty gas at low costs, all fucking day that is the former, because compared to coal they're automatically half off the bat. Coal gets pushed out, more renewables, price of carbon tax rises. At this point abating for natty gas becomes much more difficult. And so the process goes. I mean, the large majority of economists who work on climate change have concurred that a carbon tax or a carbon cap and trade is much more effective than subsidies alone, and a carbon tax will take the least severe economic toll. And it happens because of its slow staggered implementation. All of these problems you are describing are legitimate concerns but likely so long as the carbon tax was priced  properly from the start they wouldn't be as staggering of issues as you're implying. \n\n", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7513065338134766}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8322445154190063}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6760103106498718}, {"body": "Thank you.
