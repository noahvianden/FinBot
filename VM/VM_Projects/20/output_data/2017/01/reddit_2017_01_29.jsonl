Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), for example, is expected to launch a host of processors this year including the much anticipated Core i7-7700K.

{"title": "Thoughts on Gold futures", "selftext": "Feedback please.\n\nI am convinced if the 20% tax goes through that it just a bait and switch that will provide the opportunity for Trump to issue corporate tax breaks in argument to offset these costs, so prepare yourself for that adjustment next. If we know one thing about Trump over the last year it is that he is at least two steps ahead of the media and reactionary left. They have continued to play into his hand of bait and switch tactics.\nIn response, prepare yourself for the reflexivity in the market. I predict a Trump administration pushing for a weaker USD, due to comments by Mnuchin and others. This would theoretically and generally lead to stronger gold prices. However, I believe as of right now his policies will have the opposite affect and we will see a stronger USD to weaker Gold inverse. Look at late 1930s economic activities in US responses to depression and their push for less of the regulations that saved the markets and multilateral trade prior/leading to WWII. Same exact circumstances now in regards to deregulations because of greater faith in recovery the only difference is Trump is attempting to renegotiate trade to quasi bi/multilateral agreements.
