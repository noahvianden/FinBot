Is the price likely to rise when this happens?", "id": "61vtwo", "created_utc": 1490657990.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "Well TSLA is already staging a reversal from its $240 low this month. Solar roof tiles or not, I'm expecting TSLA to rise above $310 to about $355 by end of this year.\n\nThe things that will have the largest impact on TSLA stock:\n\n1. Model 3 - whether or not it will launch and deliver to customers on time\n\n2. US economy - the US economy is growing steadily - this is a big positive for auto sales\n\n3. Tesla Energy - I easily see this as being a huge profit-making opportunity to Tesla and it seems to tick all the boxes. Efficiency and scale is everything here. No company can compete here. \n\nHowever, it's not just their Solar Roofs or Powerwall business, it's also their Electric Vehicles (EV) business. The short-sellers are betting that companies like GM, Ford, Hyundai, Nissan, and BMW are going to beat Tesla with more affordable EVs. However, the fact of the matter is that none of these companies produce Lithium Ion batteries and most of them are sourced from Samsung SDI, LG Chem and Chinese battery suppliers. The Korean EV manufacturers like Hyundai and KIA are being supplied mostly by Samsung SDI and LG Chem. I believe BMW and GM also get their batteries mostly from LG Chem. \n\nI mean Samsung SDI and LG Chem already have enough customers and they aren't really big companies. If anything, each of them are about the size of Panasonic, and Panasonic is already too busy supplying its batteries to just one automaker, Tesla (I'm not totally sure if they supply any other automakers, they probably do, but not to a huge extent). Therefore, it's unrealistic to think that just 2 companies (Samsung SDI and LG Chem) can supply Li Ion batteries in massive quantities to more than 4 automakers, unless of course they expand heavily, which will take time. Most automakers, especially the premium ones like BMW and Mercedes, probably wont be touching Chinese Li Ion batteries unless it's for their cheaper models. For now, I see these premium automakers sticking to Samsung SDI/LG Chem/Panasonic.\n\nWhereas the Chinese companies are busy supplying their own Li Ion batteries to Chinese automakers.  So the supply just isn't enough to match the volume of demand. There was a detailed article on Seeking Alpha about this a few days ago. \n\nOne of the factors that drove up TSLA to $280 earlier this year was the completion of the Gigafactory, which was earlier than expected. The Gigafactory's scale and efficiency is what will make Tesla profitable. Even if Panasonic charges a premium for the Li Ion batteries, the scale and efficiency is what matters in the end since Tesla will be mass-selling EVs, Solar Roofs and Powerwall modules, and all of these use Li Ion batteries and charging components, which are mass-produced in one factory, the Gigafactory. \n\nHeck, Tesla's stock price at the moment has almost nothing to do with profitability. It's still in growth and expansion mode, similar to what happened to Amazon stock back 5 or 6 years ago. And no, I'm not saying Tesla is the same as Amazon or Tesla should be compared directly to Amazon. Amazon, while still growing, is now profitable, and they're in completely different industries. But during its growth phase, it was not at all profitable. So that is the parallel between TSLA and AMZN, both are and were growth stocks, respectively. Again, I could be wrong, but in the long term, all things are looking positive for Tesla. The energy industry will shift towards solar power, we just don't know when. The shift might even be happening as we speak. But once it happens, Tesla is well-prepared for any competition. \n\nI definitely think that Tesla may very well double to the $500 range if all of these factors come into affect as early as next year. For now, I see a medium-term target price of $340~$355 by end of this year.

I feel very bullish on the company\n\nRedHat is an open-source software solutions provider.

And Telecom companies are rapidly adapting Openstack.\n\nIBM has also partnered up with RedHat to develop private cloud systems for its customers using RedHat Technology.\n\nAs you guys can see, Redhat is really taking some serious steps in becoming an even larger cloud competing business. And with competitors Adobe and Oracle doing pretty good in the cloud business, It wouldn't be surprising to see Redhat following the trend since its a highly profitable market right now, and since most companies are outsourcing their business workloads to the cloud.\n\nThe cons?\n\nAlthough they have continuously beat EPS (Is it just me or is alot of companies doing this nowadays) but even with positive EPS and Revenues, this company still has the potential to fall in AH after ER.\n\nI also noticed that the CFO recently left the company (claiming another unnamed Corp offer him a CEO position) so they have the interim filling in for him ATM.\n\nEven with those issues I still see potential in this company. They're trying to boost revenues, closing alot of deals and have quite a few partnerships in motion. I see great guidance short term at least.\n\nSo I'll be optimistically buying calls before the market closes today, but I guess I wouldn't be completely surprised if it dropped AH so I'll buy them a bit farther out just incase I have to wait a bit for them to rebound.\n\nBut good luck to anyone shorting this company and I hope everyone can make some money!\n\nExcuse the typos as I'm writing this on my phone.\n-------------------------------------------\n\nEdit: Looks like yet another correct prediction.
