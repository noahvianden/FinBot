I basically saw this trade as a complete gamble like taking a spin at the roulette table.\n\nWith that said, still sell this week?\n\nAlso, how do I track the 'current' price of the option or whatever? \n\nI'm using etrade and all it tells me is that right now im down 17% lol\n\n[heres all the info it gives me](http://i.imgur.com/URzZXyG.png)\n\nit's confusing cause it says my price paid was .06 and current price is .06 and \"change\" is .03? and what does the green \"100%\" mean?\n\nfuck man im lost", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So youve lost 17 dollars because amd is down around 14.20 right now. As far as getting more stats on them try and find a good free website that will show you the greeks for options.\n\nI think its good your getting your feet wet, but i would recommend watching some more videos and reading up on options. \n\nCalls and puts have something called intrinsic and extrinsic value. These are related to the stocks price and tthe time left on the option. The closer your option gets to expiring the less it is worth because the chances of it meeting the strike price are lower. A good way to look at this is to look at the 17 dollar calls that expire this week and see how much they are worth. This will more or less give you the value of your options next monday given the share price is the same.\n\nNow you can see why i said to sell them this week as the time decay speeds up the closer it gets to your expiration.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amd"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5036653280258179}, {"body": "Adding to this.
