I'm not sure why people think that they're going to change - Target's plan that was presented by the CEO a week or two ago basically was, \"Lets do more of the same and hope it works.\" There is no innovation/no vision in this industry and really, trying to do something now after the industry stupidly put its head in the sand and gave Amazon a gigantic head start: well, sorry. Too late now, and retailers (well, aside from Target) are realizing that the answer is to shrink their footprint.\n\n\"As department store chains cede market share to off-price, fast-fashion and online competitors, they would need to close about 800 locations to achieve their inflation-adjusted sales productivity level of 2006, according to Green Street's 2017 Mall Outlook.\n\nThat's the equivalent of all anchor space at 200 malls, or 20 percent of U.S. mall anchor space, according to the report.\" (http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/25/department-stores-need-to-close-800-locations-to-restore-their-2006-productivity.html)\n\n\"Will they do it?\"\n\nHAHAHA. No. Lots of unrealistic fantasies in this sub lately about retail. There may be some consolidation in retail, but the largest players all deciding one day to combine is not going to happen: they're just going to fight over the smaller and smaller pie of B & M retail. Target is having to deal with Amazon on one side and Wal-Mart on the other.  How would a combination work from a logistics sense? \n\n**Also, Office Depot and Staples couldn't fucking merge because they faced antitrust - you think that every major retailer coming together is realistic? Yeah, no.**\n\nKeep in mind that Wal-Mart is still the world's largest retailer and Amazon as a % of the total retail sales in the US is less than people would think it is. However, Amazon has enormous market share when it comes to e-commerce and is responsible for a giant amount of retail growth in the US. It's not Amazon's fault that retail collectively has lacked any sort of vision for more than a decade and was completely resistant to the idea of e-commerce in a similar way that the music industry resisted digital. Ooops.\n\nEven Wal-Mart's prior CEO's major regret was not investing more in online. Retail refused to accept the idea that the way people were shopping is changing and the amazing thing is that I still don't think that many retailers are willing to accept it. And the move towards online is only going to accelerate, but you have a bunch of retailers who are now confronted with the idea of having to steer people to their website and away from their costly to run store.\n\nPeople talk about how what hasn't been working in retail seems cheap and what has been seems expensive. Yeah, the market is rewarding innovation and vision and growth and that money is going away from people who basically missed one of the industry's biggest changes in ages or really just stupidly put their fucking head in the sand and hoped that Amazon would go away. Well, it didn't and the time to really challenge it was *years* ago. You think that these retailers will change and innovate and adapt? I'm not seeing it in the slightest.\n\nAlso, the people long retail on the idea that Amazon will save them by buying (dated) big box real estate kind of remind me of the people who owned GPRO at $30 when there was a ridiculous analyst discussion about how \"Apple's gonna buy it!\" Amazon isn't going to extend an olive branch to retail, they're not going to buy them for distribution centers (Prologis works for them just fine) and if Amazon starts opening the grocery-centric stores they've talked about, they're going to open smaller stores, not big boxes. *Big boxes are so 10 years ago and retailers who own them simply haven't figured that out yet or simply aren't willing to admit it* - but they're going to when they start closing and there's no one who wants a giant space and it starts to cost a lot to break up the store. Or they're just going to sit empty, or be torn down and repurposed as something else. Retail in the US sq ft per capita is *absurdly* overbuilt in terms of retail in comparison to other developed nations and it's been that way for years - e-commerce has simply gotten to the point where retail can't collectively ignore this anymore. As for Amazon and stores, them buying Whole Foods is more likely but I don't think there's a serious chance of that happening, either.\n\nTarget apparently needs yet another new CEO because anyone who watched the CNBC interview the other day cannot be encouraged by what they saw. Home Depot will be okay because of the needs it serves. Wal-Mart isn't going anywhere and they continue to take grocery share while Target has spent more than two years trying to figure out what to do with the problems that it is encountering in grocery.  Take away the coupons they spam to people away and Bed Bath and Beyond doesn't justify its existence. Gap is going to close stores. JCP will close stores. Macy's and Nordstrom's will close stores. Sears is done within the year, probably. HHGregg going ch11. Retail's going to shrink: I don't know why people are eager to fight against that. It is what it is. Aside from Amazon, look at SHOP ramp higher.

I think these are the 2 biggest challenges that each business has.  And I think the obvious answer is that building the online presence is going to be much more feasible.\n\nWalmart is already the 2nd most popular online retailer.  And after purchasing Jet.com, Moosejaw.com, and a few others, they are poised to build an even more incredible internet presence.  It is very easy to buy internet presence.  And Walmart has the capital to do it. \n\nWalmart also has much better prices to attract the price-conscious consumers:\nhttp://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/reviewedcom/2017/02/01/amazon-vs-walmart-where-can-you-get-the-best-deal-with-free-shipping/97298906/\n\nAnd in case you're shopping for junk on Amazon, Walmart made a nifty \"Savings Catcher\" that you install in your web browser.

And the minimum cost for your online order is only $35.  And as a response, Amazon just secretly lowered their online minimum for free shipping from $50 to $35:\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2017/02/21/amazon-free-shipping-order-minimum/#19b80a464d3c\n\nBut here's the biggest advantage: Walmart has the physical infrastructure in place.  Walmart has over 5333 brick and mortar buildings, that are more than stores: they're essentially warehouses that people can walk through, that also have a grocery store.

{"title": "The AMD Voltron Model - Speculation Inside", "selftext": "Please study this image before continuing, consider printing it out and taping it above your bed as a constant reminder for the future: https://imgur.com/a/Mvp8J\n\nWhat you're looking at is the AMD Voltron model. The first thing you'll notice is that it looks the cartoons you would watch on Saturday mornings while your mom was on the phone with your doctor saying that the pills weren\u2019t working. Maybe that's just me, but don't worry, this is by design for simplicity so bear with me.\n\n\nLet's start with Ryzen and Jim Keller, for those who don't know who he is open up another tab and find out. Ryzen is an absolute powerhouse and absolutely crushes multi-threaded applications. And while many people have this sentiment that Keller is a fucking baller, I think the waters have been muddied with all this 1080p 7700k gaming nonsense. Yes INTC processors perform better in single-threaded applications and will be better performing in games that were designed for single-threaded processing. But here's what makes it different from Bulldozer: Ryzen is very close in these single-threaded applications and this is a very important distinction to notice. The fact that a never before seen architecture with no optimizations or considerations by developers, BIOS issues and OS issues (none of which are the fault of AMD) is performing competitively is incredible. As programmers get their hands on these and start to work with them, the performance gap will close. And then when the future inevitably brings us multi-threaded vidya games, that Ryzen CPU you bought 2 years ago will finally reach its final form. Ryzen is far more future-proof than Intel's 7th or 8th iteration of the same architecture, as we go forward into the future more applications will take advantage of Ryzen's fresh technology. [Everything I just said but smarter and with an accent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylvdSnEbL50)\n\n\nThen we have the R5 and R3 series, current rumors say that the R5 will be a 6-core processor priced anywhere from $199 to $299. This is going to be the death of the 7700k, the only thing that Intel fanboys have to lean on right now.  Even with 1080p benchmarks taken into consideration, who would want to spend an extra $100 to get 500 FPS in CS:GO when anything over 300 (120 to be honest) is superfluous? Spend that extra cash on a GPU so you can play in 4k like the real gamer girl we all aspire to be. You have a 240hz monitor? Shoulda got Freesync (AMD strikes again).\n\n\n\u201cBut 10nm Cannonlake is right around the corner, it\u2019s just a matter of time before Intel fires back!\u201d\n\n\nOh, how wrong this is.\n\n\n10nm yields have been so bad for Intel that Cannonlake is being resigned to dumpster-tier duty and being used for SoC\u2019s and other low-wattage purposes. What\u2019s actually happening is Kaby Lake is being refined AGAIN at 14nm and will be named \u201cCoffee Lake\u201d as their next desktop CPU.  So not only has their \u201cTick-Tock\u201d model failed, but this is going to be the 8TH GENERATION of the same core series. This horse is beyond dead and beaten, unless Intel comes out of left field with a brand new architecture this is going to be Pentium 4 all over again.\n\n\nSo then there\u2019s Vega, there\u2019s a lot of speculation and I have faith in my man Raja Koduri but I can\u2019t say for sure what it\u2019ll be like. NVDA seems to have their shit together more than INTC right now and announcing the 1080ti was the right move by them, AMD has to make sure they announce Vega at the right time. Too early and people will lose interest by the time it\u2019s available, and if it\u2019s too late people will start getting angsty and buy NVDA instead. But I\u2019m less interested in who\u2019ll have the bigger dick in enthusiast graphics and want to know more about Vega\u2019s role in APUs and Semi-Customs\u2026\n\n\nSemi-Custom chips have been the only thing keeping AMD alive up until now, namely consoles, and shit is about to get real. As of right now, you can bet your ass that the next Xbone360 and Playstation5 will feature a Ryzen architecture paired with Vega, and the performance leap from this generation to the next will be far greater than the last one. Consoles have always had the benefit of being highly optimized and I would not be surprised if we could see consoles push 60 fps in 2k, shit why not 4k. If Elon Musk thinks he can hurl people in tubes across the country we can do fucking 60@4k by the end of the console\u2019s life cycle. There\u2019s also VR to take into consideration as well, some people think it\u2019s a gimmick and I\u2019m sort of inclined to agree. But the barrier of entry would be significantly lowered if Zen/Vega semi-customs perform as well as I think they will which may finally open the doors for developers. There are also new rumors that Apple is getting in on the Ryzen action, semi-customs for the iMacs and a low-watt 8-core APU for the Macbook Pro sounds like a fucking win boys.\n\n\nAnd lastly, perhaps Intel\u2019s final foothold, the datacenter. There have been leaks of Intel\u2019s new Skylake-EP Xeon, a 32 core 64 thread monstrosity featuring over 3600 pins. What matters the most here will be performance per watt, and if the leaks we\u2019ve seen are true for both Skylake-EP and Naples it\u2019s going to be very competitive. Seeing as AMD currently has nothing in the server market, even being just competitive is going to be very good for them. I can\u2019t say for sure what the benchmarks will be, but in classic AMD fashion they\u2019ll probably undercut Intel massively and it\u2019s going to be a very attractive product for datacenters. \n\n\nConsider getting on this train now that the hype bubble is deflated, cause this is the year of Su and we\u2019re leaving with or without you.\n", "id": "5xxb85", "created_utc": 1488848438.0, "score": 48, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "I stopped reading once I saw AMDtron because ANYONE who takes time to make that freaking picture..clearly isn't Fkn around. \n\nBut anyways, Logic says buy the dip, and so I shall.\n\nSidenote: $USRM is making headway and the research is out that proves that PRP-ADSC injections can restore tissues at an insanely fast rate", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "**Tldr** *I didn't read any of this.
