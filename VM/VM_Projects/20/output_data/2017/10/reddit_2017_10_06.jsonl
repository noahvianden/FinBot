I love that website.  Its very useful.  When I started learning more about technical indicators such as SMA, MACD, Volume, etc, I added them to my TOS software.  I would pick random stocks and look at historic price action compared to whatever the indicators said at that time.  Gave me some context for what to look for.  \n\nMost importantly, I opened an account with TD Ameritrade.  They don't do a hard credit check.  I never funded my account, either.  This allowed me to download and use the TOS software for free. I only use the charts module in it.  \n\nFundamentals are important because we want to pick companies that are profitable and will grow in the future.  But I feel like technicals are necessary for pinpointing entry/exit points.  I always try to have a plan for entry and also exit before I even purchase.  And usually will sell and cut losses if my choices fail and drop ~8%.  \n\nI hope this helps.  I'm into options lately, its been fun!\n\n\nEDIT: I find Finviz.com super helpful too.

A friend of mine works in HVAC, and drives all over the state in his van. Racks up a ton of driving miles, and the company replaces the vans every 2-3 years. It seems like a huge boon for these companies if the vehicle drank significantly less fuel over its lifespan. There are a lot of other companies that could benefit as well. Off the top of my head UPS and Fed Ex stand out.\n\nA lot of people seem to be betting on Tesla. I'm not at all sold on them personally as they don't seem to yield much results, and are constantly pushing back deadlines for their Model 3.
