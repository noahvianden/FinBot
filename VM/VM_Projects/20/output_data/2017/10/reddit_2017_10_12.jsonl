Find a pot stock you like, or something really dumb like GBTC to trade Bitcoin.  Other super volatile things are levered like NUGT, or UWT, UVXY,...you could even just buy VIX and hope that something blows up between now and Jan.

Seems counter-intuitive to actually learning how to invest properly. No one in their right mind would set a standard of 25% gains over the course of a semester and expect it to be reasonable. Most fund managers don't even do that in a year; if you could consistently produce 25% returns a year (which is approx. 1/3-1/4 of what your professor is asking), you'd be the richest fund manager in the world.\n\nWith that said, I think you are taking the wrong strategy here for making 25% by the end of semester, but the right strategy for someone in the real world trying to pursue steady growth (and that is why this econ project is so asinine). To make a 25% return in a short period of time you're going to have to either swing trade/day trade high volatility stocks or have a highly concentrated portfolio of stocks positioned well to take off. I think it is unlikely that stable growth stocks like NFLX, TGT, and AMZN are going to shoot up 25%+ in the next 3-4 months. Although, NFLX might do that - they've been on a tear lately.\n\nAlso, you're going to have to have a concentrated portfolio. Diversification is universally seen as a good thing for a stable portfolio that generates wealth over the long term. But, for this project you need a huge rally, not diversification. Diversification is usually seen as good because it lowers risk, but also lowers reward a bit. The problem here is, since you need such stellar performance in a short period of time, any laggards in your diversified portfolio might cause you to miss your mark. You're better off making a few big bets on just a couple of stocks you have high conviction in to perform 25%+ in the next quarter. \n\nTL;DR: This project is teaching students how to invest poorly by instituting such a ridiculous goal. It's basically just encouraging amateur investors to bet it all on high volatility stocks with the hopes of catching a rocket on takeoff. I recommend doing some research and using a highly concentrated portfolio that you have a high amount of convictions will take off in the next quarter. If you do not reach 12.5k, I'd write my 10 page essay on why 25% returns over the course of 3-4 months is unrealistic and unsustainable. Also, you can explain that long term investors should expect more modest returns in a highly diversified portfolio in exchange for lower risk and stability of funds. Remind your professor that time in the market is more important than timing the market.\n\nBest of luck.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for this by the way.
