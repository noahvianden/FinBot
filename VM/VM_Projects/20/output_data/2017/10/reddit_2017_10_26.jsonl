{"title": "$AAL - Advantage Lithium - Undervalued Small Cap Player with great potential.", "selftext": "What is Advantage Lithium?\n\nAdvantage Lithium Corp. operates as a resource company. The Company specializes in the strategic acquisition, exploration, and development of lithium properties. Advantage Lithium offers its services in Canada. \n\nI have been eyeing this baby since it was featured in The Economist and believe now is a good time to buy in: \nhttps://www.economist.com/news/americas/21723451-three-south-american-countries-have-much-worlds-lithium-they-take-very-different\n\nWhy should you care?\n\nAdvantage Lithium is still undervalued compared to its peers, it has a market cap of CAD$ 103.419.823. It seems that the big players have also started taking notice of this, clarifying the huge increases in volume over the last days, yesterday we hit a record volume of nearly 10M shares in Canada.\n\nAdvantage is guided by Orocobre, one of the leading producers in the Lithium Triangle. Orocobre already has a deal with Toyota to supply them their required lithium for battery production. Advantage, being positioned closely to Orocobre's lithium plant, will likely supply Orocobre with lithium brine. This means their operations will likely be very asset light reducing chances of dilution  \n\nDrilling results from Advantage have also been excellent further positioning this stock for price increases the coming weeks. I personally think we will see the 1.00 level in the coming weeks.\n\nEight Capital yesterday published a report on Advantage Lithium yesterday giving them a $1.90 price target (link down below).\n\nhttps://viiicapital.frontline.ca/PDFs/Reports/2017/October/AAL102517.pdf\n\nAnd lastly, always do your own DD, but I think you won\u2019t regret picking up some shares.\n\n\n", "id": "78wwc1", "created_utc": 1509036935.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "What\u2019s your entry pint on this?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Looks like the peak is 0.659?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the reminder.
