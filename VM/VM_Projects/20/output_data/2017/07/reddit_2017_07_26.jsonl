That's about to come to an end real soon. \n\n**The Elephant in the Room:**\n\nWhen Ethereum was first created, the coders put in a literal time bomb in the code to move Ethereum from a Proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake concept of blockchain verification. \n\n**What is the difference between proof-of-stake (PoS) and proof-of-work (PoW)?**\n\nPoW is the current system where different users contribute computer power for the chance to be the user to validate the next block on the chain and get a payout (mining). Proof-Of-Stake is a new algorithm that determines the validating user through their stake in the system, and undermines the inefficient mining process. \n\n**So what is this \"bomb\" they put in**\n\nSo what happened was the creators of ethereum dropped a \"difficulty bomb\" that when detonated will make it exponentially difficult to add blocks to the chain. This was put in to force the change over to PoS algorithm for validation. \n\n**What the fuck does this have to do with my beautiful Su Bae?**\n\nIf the bomb goes into effect and the developers decide to switch over to a PoS system, then mining is completely ***FUCKED*** and miners will ***DUMP*** used GPU's on the market. The used GPU market will be flooded and completely over-saturated. Demand will drop like a rock for new GPU's because the mining population will be wiped out and gamers can purchase a lightly used one for a heavy discount. \n\n\n**How can I cover my ass?**\n\nGet out of $AMD, get out of $NVDA, \nNo one knows when the difficulty bomb will detonate, but when it does, $AMD will die faster than Paul Walker on his way to a charity event, so Short Sell baby. Ride the over-inflated stock until it hits $5 and thank me later.
