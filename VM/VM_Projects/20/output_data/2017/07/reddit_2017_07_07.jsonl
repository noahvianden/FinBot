The RX Vega is a gaming card and judging from the performance of the Vega FE its performance will in the best case scenario be on par with Nvidia Geforce GTX 1080 and will perform worse than Nvidias Geforce GTX 1080ti, the current performance king for gaming, in almost all popular games.\n\n  Both the 1080 and 1080ti will be over a year old when RX vega is released. Best case scenario AMDs RX Vega will be able to beat the GTX 1080 in price but because of the high margins on cards in this price range Nvidia will likely be able to drop prices to compete and still make a profit.\n\n   With the upcoming release(early 2018) of Nvidias volta which will likely beat all the cards mentioned and AMDs next generation of graphics cards, Navi, not being released until 2019 that will leave Nvidia with over 3 years(gtx 1080 was released May 27, 2016) of market dominance in the high margin high performance graphics card market. I believe NVIDIA will increase their market share in the graphics card market until at least 2019. For these reasons I'm buying NVIDIA. If one month from now RX Vega somehow miraculosly exceeds all expectations in terms of performance and price I might be persuaded to sell.\n\n  That being said AMD has done reasonably well in the lower margin higher volume reasonably priced graphics card market recently and they are killing it in the CPU market where NVIDIA does not participate.", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amd", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Take what $ you would put into one and divide it among the three.
