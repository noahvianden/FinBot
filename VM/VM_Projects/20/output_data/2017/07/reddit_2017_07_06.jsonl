Any time the customer growth dips even slightly below expectations, the stock drops like a stone. However, looking past the surface, they're building a very solid customer base and product that in the long term weathers the ups and downs of the market. They're offering a crapload of entertainment for $12/month. The cost/value of the product is second to none in the entertainment industry. This is why people are shedding cable for streaming, and NF leads the pack there. Yeah, subscriber *growth* fluctuates, but subscriber *base* tends to be pretty solid. \n\nAs for Uber, I have no fucking clue what people see in them. The whole company seems like it's build on a foundation of sand, and at some point someone's going to finally realize it and the bottom will completely drop out. I think Uber is flash in the pan.

Free netflix with commercials + paid netflix with none. This would give a HUGE bump to their user base and a large bit of profits with all the commercial revenue.\n\n3) Lower subscription cost ($5) + commercials for all. Their content is growing and is becoming as quality as HBO content. Could you imagine having HBO for $5 and *not* having to pay for the entire cable subscription?
