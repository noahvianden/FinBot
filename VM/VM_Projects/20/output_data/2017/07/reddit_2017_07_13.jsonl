{"title": "My 2nd horrible analysis on current US economy", "selftext": "Couple days ago I posted this:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6lznbj/my_napkin_theory_about_current_inflation_and_next/\n\nTurned out it is such a bad observation that everyone calls me an idiot. Guess what? Here is another horrible analysis. Based on a popular paper published by Paul Lemont in 2007 before the market bubble busted:\n\nhttp://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article307.html\n\nHe called out 3 signs of a economy recession:\n1) Real Estate debt rise vs real estate equity\n2) Car sale: his point is when new car sales fall \"by 2% or more, the economy has either been in a recession or about to enter one.\"\n3) GDP: GDP is slowing down 5.6% to 2.6% to 0.9% in the first 3 quarters of 2007\n\nThat being said, how is the situation right now? \n\n1) Housing: I'm too lazy to do reasearch on this but as I point out in my previous theory, expensive housing still might be a culprit due to high rent and high property tax.\n \n2) New car sales: here is the current car sale in US:\n\nhttp://www.motorintelligence.com/m_frameset.html (click on New Vehicle Sales link)\n\nTL:DR? New car sales dropped 2.1% YOY (June 16 vs June 17) and there is no sign of stopping. Why do people stop buying car? Where does the money go if our economy is in such a good shape?\n\n3) GDP. Real GDP drops from 3.5% in 3rd quarter to 2.1% in 4th quarter 2016 to 1.4% in 1st quarter 2017.\n\nhttps://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm\n\nSo what could be the 3rd signs of recession, I would argue it is inflation. This is 2007 inflation:\n\nhttp://www.inflation.eu/inflation-rates/united-states/historic-inflation/cpi-inflation-united-states-2007.aspx\n\nThis is 2017 inflation:\n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf\n\nAll hell breaks loose when CPI starts dropping like crazy which it is right now. And Yellen confirms that this morning things don't look to well with inflation.\n\nMy point? This is another trash analysis. But I think something fuckery is cooking.\n\n\n", "id": "6my7vs", "created_utc": 1499906626.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Makes a DD, \"too lazy to research.\"\n\nQuality.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "Only 3 steps to predict the eminent collapse of the world economy. \n\nStep 1- fuck if I know, I ain't got time to figure that out.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1194789707660675}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20036208629608154}, {"body": "Used cars is where it's at bro.

Disk bottlenecks are less of an issue when you have eight CPU cores but when you have a thousand GPU cores they're completely unacceptable\n\nBasically it looks like we may be seeing a paradigm shift here.

(Facebook is largely a distributed app deployed to thousands of servers running on OpenCompute hardware via bittorrent.)\n\nA lot of the blue chip companies aren't in the same spot. For instance, that company with 130K servers, they literally had thousands of servers where they had no idea what the user names were, what the passwords were, what the servers were doing.

Very few customers keep their data on the server in the rack, their data generally lives on some type of network storage somewhere else in the data center, or even in another state.

For instance, the most popular paradigm right now is to buy a rack full of computing gear and run all of the apps in virtual machines. Cisco UCS + VMWare is a typical example of this. In a single rack, a customer can run about 4000 virtual machines.\n\nWith the massive parallelism of GPUs, it seems like that density could utterly shoot through the roof.\n\nIf it does, I think it could be VERY bad for the storage vendors. IE, if you used to have 30 physical servers it made a lot of sense to attach them to a network storage device.\n\nIf you fold all of that down into a single 4U box running thousands of containers instead of a hundred VMs, then the network storage becomes a massive bottleneck. Even at 10G, you don't want a thousand applications making ISCSI connections to a netapp.\n\nSo if I'm right:\n\nThis is very good for NVIDIA, memory manufacturers and SSD manufacturers\n\nThis is absolutely atrocious for DELL/EMC, Netapp, Hitachi.
