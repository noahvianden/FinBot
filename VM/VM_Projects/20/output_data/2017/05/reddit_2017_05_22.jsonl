{"title": "Let's talk about $QCOM.", "selftext": "All right boys and girls. \n\n$QCOM gets sued by $AAPL and shits the bed in January. Drops over 20% to ~$52 (a HUGE drop for this stock, since it's not really volatile and has very small moves on regular days, 86% institutional ownership). It recovers slowly but steadily over the next couple of months, gaining 11% and almost touching $60. After that, they have a not-so stellar ER and guidance for obvious reasons ($AAPL not paying the royalties), but only drop slightly, and still hover around $57-$58 range. \n\nThen another whammy, $BBRY (a garbage company that should be burned to the ground) gets gifted $900m in an arbitration decision VS $QCOM, so the stock drops like a rock to $51-$52 about a month ago. Since then, it has again recovered and gained 10% yet again and is approaching $58. \n\n$QCOM has shown a tremendous ability to bounce back from lows and establish considerable support along the way. They are also in the process of acquiring $NXPI which would substantially increase their scope of business (Friday night they announced an $11.0 Billion unsecured senior notes offering - rated by the S&P as \"A\" - in part to fund the acquisition). \n\nThey are also suing the manufacturers of $AAPL products that were ordered to not pay the royalties to $QCOM. AND they are attempting to stop the import of IPhones into the US by filing a motion with the International Trade Commission. A bold move, to say the least.\n\nIn short, the potential for gains in this scenario is huge. Is it risky play? Yes. Does it have potential for massive returns? Yes. Does it have potential for massive losses? Yes. But, gentlemen, isn't this what we do?\n\nTLDR; I'm buying $2,000 worth of Jan 19, 2018 $70 strike calls tomorrow. Godspeed, boys.
