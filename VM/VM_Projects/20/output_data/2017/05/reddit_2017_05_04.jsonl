{"title": "Should your friends benefit from your trading skill?", "selftext": "So I had this debate with both myself and two friends of mine yesterday.\n\nI am at the point where I am comfortable at trading and am starting to see greener days. I've worked for years on my trading psychology, scanners, entry/exit points, etc. by reading various books, watching videos/tutorials, attending seminars, and asking questions to anyone willing to answer them. I've invested thousands in myself to better myself as a trader. Not only that, but more precious than money is the amount of time I have invested in learning.\n\nWhich brings me to my point, a few friends started asking me if I can give them my overnight plays. I said no. Some time later they asked if I can tell them when I make a play/or inform them of what I am investing in. I thought that was ludicrous. Yesterday, they asked me to teach them how to trade and would like me to show them everything I've learned. This made me think.\n\nIs it fucked up to say no? I personally don't think so. I have another friend who is a math wiz but who charges me for when he tutors me, as he should imo. Time is money. Should I charge my friends for my trading services? Do it for free? I don't think them getting what took me 2+ years to learn in a free weekend \"crash course\" of sorts is at all fair.\n\nWhat I thought about is that they can begin learning on their own after receiving a set of tools I give them (book recommendations, key videos, etc) They learn at their on pace and can ask me about any concepts/ideas that do not make sense to them. This seems most logical to me as I am generally willing to share what I know with others.\n\nAny other traders/financiers having or have had this dilemma?\n\nTL;DR Read the title.\n\nEdit: For a bit of background, we are planning on opening a business together and go to the same University. All three of us are Business majors. Given these facts, investing does come up in conversation alot. I can honestly say that I piqued both of their interests in the stock market, as they were not interested in it at all before.
