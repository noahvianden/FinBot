I've watched videos teaching about on Call & Put options, and checked out the \"Useful Information\" section within this subreddit. I've looked at various virtual trading apps, but the ones I've found don't allow for Call & Put options. \n\nMy apologies if this post is redundant or a waste of anyone's time.

Risk no more than 5% of the account on any one trade. 2% is even a better number for novices. So for a $10,000 account, 5% is $500, 2% is $200.\n\nTrade liquid options. Wide bid/ask spreads will be the death of many newbies. While any single trade may still be profitable, over the long haul that friction makes long term profits unlikely. I suggest no more than a 10% bid/ask spread, so 50 cents bid, 55 cents ask. Or $1.20 bid $1.30 ask or similar.\n\nHave a plan before entering the trade. Don't be that person that comes here and says, I did XYZ trade, now what should I do? Plan the trade, trade the plan. Stick to the plan. It doesn't have to be elaborate, but think about what you will do if the underlying is up, down and unchanged. Follow the plan.\n\nLast, keep a trading journal. Again, simple is better, because a person is more likely to keep it going. One line, with the price of the underlying, price of the option, reason for the trade is plenty. Reason can be as little as one word, such as: earnings, chart, other news, gut. \n\nTLDR: trade small, trade liquid underlyings, have a plan, keep a journal.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "This is great advice.

Find a strategy that you like and stick to it, for at least 6-12 months.\n\n3. Have a good plan.\n\n4. Set your performance goals in years, not months or weeks.\n\n5. When starting trading new strategy, paper trade for at least one month, then start small and gradually increase the allocation.\n\n6. Find a mentor that you can trust and follow him. Try to understand what he is doing. If you don't understand the rationale and the risks of the trade, don't take it.\n\n7. Position sizing is the key. With proper position sizing, even 5-7 losers will have little impact on your account.\n\nNo matter what someone tells you, trading is one of the toughest things you can do.
