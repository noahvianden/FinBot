So...best example to simplify is if you buy a 100 strike call for May and sell a 100 strike call for April - in terms of the stock movement itself you have zero risk.  If the stock pops and someone calls your short call for 100 you can just use your long call to buy for 100 and its breakeven\n\nBUT\n\nYou had to pay something to enter the position. That's the risk. \n\nSo in this example shit the options around a bit to make it more clear.  Put all the same strikes together. He has 142 calls and puts, long and short for both dates.  Then also he has long 145 calls and long 138 puts for the May date\n\nYou can tell the graph isnt giving you the full picture by thinking through that.  If you get to the April date and stock is at 142, the short April options expire worthless.  You then own a variety of May options. The question is would that basket of May options be worth more than the $15.18 you paid for everything?  The graph says they'd be worth $3k more than you'd pay for them.  But you're holding a basket of options that you bought pre-earnings at high IV.  And because the stock didn't pop or drop on earnings the chance the OTM options coming ITM is significantly reduced\n\nBasically it just doesn't characterize the value of the longer dated options correctly, doesn't capture how they will move", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "This comment. And yes, the fact it is a calendar makes it hard to estimate what the price of the back month options (expiring next month) will be on the expiration date of the front month options (expiring next week). The blue line assumes that the IV of the back month options stays the same and after earnings we all know that the volatility term structure shifts down most of the time - you'd have to assume that the IV crush will take ~10-15% of your back month long positions' IV out and wreck your strategy. Unless Netflix has horrible earnings and they go down 50% or if for some reason vol stays the same (like it did for FB earnings 1 year ago) after earnings then this strategy won't work out as planned. Essentially, with a ~15% IV step down your position turns into a massive straddle-like payoff with a rounded bottom and you may just be better off buying a DOTM strangle for next month.
