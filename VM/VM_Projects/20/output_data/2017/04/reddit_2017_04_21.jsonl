{"title": "Basic Stock Market Terms for Beginners", "selftext": "Hey there,\n\n\n[Most these terms can be found on Investopedia, which is the best stock market resource](http://www.investopedia.com/)\n\nThese are just some basic terms that any newcomers to this subreddit should know so they can understand discussion on here:\n\nMost of you, already know these of course.\n\n**10 Terms**\n\n* Stock: A stock is a slice of the pie. When you own stock, you have claim to the pie's filling, crust, and whip cream. So when you own stock you own part of the company. Keep in mind there are usually millions or billions of shares, so one share is a very small portion. There are two types of stock: Common and Preferred. These have different stock symbols. Common stockholders are usually individual investors like us. We get dividends, and if we own enough we have a right to vote inside the corporation. Preferred stockholders are usually institutions because they come with tax advantages. They do not get voting rights, but they do get their dividends first as higher priority.\n\n* Market Capitalization: So if you were to buy 100% of a company by purchasing 100% of its shares, it would cost you the market cap. The market cap. is calculated by taking the Share price and multiplying by how many shares there are. $xx.xx * Shares outstanding. That simple.\n\n* EPS: Earnings per share. Literally what it is. It's how much each individual share (keep in mind there are millions of shares) earns by itself if it was visualized in a way of how much each share earns for the company. Each individual share does not actually earn this, it is a way to measure the business's earnings. It is Net income / shares outstanding. Net income is after the the cost of revenue, research, administrative costs, interest, and taxes are paid out. EPS is what companies report each quarter.\n\n* Bear Market: Bear market, bear stocks, all have a negative outlook, 'pessimistic'. 2008 Stock market crash was a bear market. When you are bearish on a trade, you think the security will move down in price. Buying puts are bearish (in case stock goes down you want some insurance).\n\n* Bull Market: Bull is the opposite of the bear. These have positive outlooks, 'optimistic'. We are currently in a Trump Bull Market. When you are bullish on a trade you expect it to rise in price. Selling puts are bullish (you benefit from stock going up).\n\n* Volatility: It's exactly what it means. There's volatility in markets, stocks, options, etc. If a market is volatile, the range of daily movements can be very large in a short period of time. Check out the [VIX Volatility S&P 500](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EVIX?p=%5EVIX)\n\n* Bluechip: Bluechips are the most expensive poker chip. Just like the most expensive companies. AAPL, GOOG, AMZN. These guys have billions of dollars in cash ready to back up their company if they ever need it. They are financially secure, and have an unlikely chance of going bankrupt. They are considered low risk for this reason, as one of many reasons. They also are not usually volatile and don't move much daily.\n\n* Assets: Assets are anything a company owns that has an economic value. These are items that can be sold for cash in the future, or reduce cost in the future.\n\n* Liabilities: These are a company's bills. They have to pay them back eventually, they are liable for them. These include accounts payable, and long/short term debt.\n\n* Stockholder equity: Where does the cash go when you buy stock? It goes to the stockholder equity section on a company's balance sheet.\n\n* Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder equity.\n\nHope these definitions clarify some confusing things for beginners!\n\n", "id": "66qmr4", "created_utc": 1492795388.0, "score": 198, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you for the refresher", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.044435691088438034}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.052158936858177185}, {"body": "Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder equity [FTFY]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for catching that, even a small mistake like that can really confuse someone!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17717242240905762}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.45666274428367615}, {"body": "Large cap vs small cap asking for a friend ", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Large Cap companies have a Market cap above 10 billion $, while small cap companies have a Market cap between 300m and 2 billion $.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.42508870363235474}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22376126050949097}, {"body": "You forgot Bagholder.
