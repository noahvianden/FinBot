I want to buy a Tesla Model 3, which should start production in a few months, but think that just pulling money out of my pocket would be nonsensical when I have enough to invest in the company before they start production and delivery, then use the money earned from selling the stock to buy the car.\n\n\nHistorically, this stock has only gone up and up, and in the last three months it's gone up 43%. I guestimate that purchasing 60k worth of stock will yield slightly less than 30k in profit, especially when their vehicles are set to start production soon and will hopefully induce around a 30% increase in stock price (Tesla Model S yielded around 20% increase whole Model X increased 30%).
