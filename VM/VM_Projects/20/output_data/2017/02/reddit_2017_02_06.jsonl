For example, currently the Feb 24 100's are going for like $18ish a piece, meaning if the stock goes past 118 after earnings you will make money, probably a couple hundred bucks for every dollar it goes past that per contract.\n\nI personally bought several ITM calls and one type of OTM call but it was not far OTM and is now ITM by roughly $3.

I think there's a good chance we'll see ATH touched again (around $119) before EOD Thursday, and that'd be a good time to get the fuck out of the weeklies. This is risky though, if SP stays static or drops, you are now in true FD YOLO territory and your life depends on their earnings.\n\nIf you want to be a bit more conservative, buy just a couple of very slightly OTM calls that are like 3-4 months out.
