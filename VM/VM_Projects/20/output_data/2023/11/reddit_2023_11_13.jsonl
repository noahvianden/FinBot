It's a common mistake that people hear and spread further. VIX is a volatility index about SPX options specifically. But because SPX is a broad index, the S&P 500, people assume it represents any specific individual stock they want to trade, particularly if that stock is a constituent of the S&P 500. But it's simply not true. The IV of options on NVDA, for example, isn't identical to the IV on AAPL, despite them being in the same industry sector. When you go further afield, like XOM or JNJ, all bets are off.\n\nNow that said, the *directional trend* of IV tends to correlate. If VIX is going up, IV for AAPL, NVDA, XOM and JNJ are probably also going up at the same time, but not necessarily by the same amount.\n\nA more reliable observation for shorting puts is watching for the stock price to hit a downtrend. That increases demand for puts and makes them more valuable. The problem is that you don't want to be short a put if it's in a downtrend, since the further down the stock goes, the higher the buy-back cost of the put becomes. No free lunch.\n\nSo no, the *worst* time to be shorting puts is major stock market corrections. If you want to play it safe, you want uptrends and bull markets. You'll only make pennies on the dollar for your investment, but better than having to pay $1000 for a put that only earned you $69 in credit at open.

So going long on shares of some stock means your trade will profit (the beneficial outcome) when the stock goes up, since stocks going up is the expected direction.\n\nConversely, \"going short\" means aligning the beneficial outcome of something with the *opposite* direction of the one that is expected. So going short shares of some stock means your trade will profit (the beneficial outcome) when the stock goes down, which is opposite the expected direction. This also means your trade will suffer if the shares go up.\n\nThis implies that you need to know what the expected directionality of X is before you can understand what long X and short X mean.\n\nSo let's apply that to a greek like delta. Going long delta means you profit when the delta of the trade increases, which is the expected direction of delta for either a put or a call. Going short delta means you profit when delta decreases, which is the opposite of the expected direction.\n\nThis usually comes up when comparing the directional posture of an options trade versus it's inherent posture. For example, a long call is inherently long delta and short theta. You benefit when delta increases (the expected direction) but lose money when theta increases (the expected direction).

I'm very skeptical towards the market, which is where I think this stuff will actually help me out. I'd feel more confident investing as algorithmically and quantitatively as possible, to avoid relying on my own clairvoyance as much as possible.

{"title": "\ud83c\udf1f Resistance is Futile: Palantir Will Secure S&P 500 Inclusion \ud83d\udcc8, Predicting Another 20% Move Before End of Year \ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[Resistance is Futile - Palantir Borg](https://preview.redd.it/fiqa11t9610c1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5dc3258a205d232750338ca4a8608be86e6febc)\n\nI've been piecing together various economic insights and thought it would be interesting to share and discuss them here. We have a mix of macroeconomic analysis from the All-In Podcast, observations from Flexport, and the latest earnings report from Palantir, which all seem to paint an intriguing picture for growth stocks.\n\n1. All-In Podcast Insights: The podcast suggests a cautiously optimistic economic outlook leading into the 2024 U.S. election cycle. Key points include a stable or improving economy, which will not provide the opposition with economic shortcomings to leverage against the current administration. Notable indicators include a decrease in the M2 money supply, beneficial for inflation control but challenging for financial assets, and a predicted decline in inflation due to adjustments in components like rents.\n\n2. Flexport's Freight Boom: Ryan Petersen's tweet about a 32% week-over-week increase in ocean freight bookings on the transpacific eastbound route signals robust economic activity. This surge indicates U.S. businesses are preparing for strong consumer demand in the holiday season, reflecting confidence in the economy and proactive management of potential inventory challenges.\n\n3. Palantir's Q3 2023 Earnings: Palantir reports a significant milestone with its fourth consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability, a GAAP EPS of $0.03, and robust revenue growth. Key highlights include:\n\n   \\- GAAP net income of $72 million (13% margin)\n\n   \\- Revenue growth of 17% year-over-year to $558 million\n\n   \\- Significant growth in both commercial and government sectors\n\n   \\- Adjusted income from operations of $163 million (29% margin)\n\n   \\- Strong cash reserves of $3.3 billion\n\nFor Q4 2023, Palantir expects revenues between $599 - $603 million and has raised its full-year 2023 revenue guidance to $2.216 - $2.220 billion.\n\nConclusion with S&P 500 Rebalance Impact on Palantir: Given Palantir's strong performance, there's speculation about its potential inclusion in the S&P 500 during the December rebalance. This will lead to a spike in Palantir's share price, as mutual funds and 'smart money' investors will see the company as a stable and profitable investment opportunity. The anticipation of this inclusion, coupled with mutual funds actively seeking investment opportunities post their fiscal year-end, will position Palantir favorably in the market.\n\n Looking forward to your thoughts and analysis on this!
