Literally just to obtain a talent pool which amounted to a competitive advantage. Many of these tech companies really didn't use nearly as many as they hired.\n\nFor example Facebook hires (I'm not sure about now, but they did this at least a few years ago) into a pool. New hires didn't even know what they were going to be working on.

Not many tickers really met the criteria for the scan in the bullish direction. Also, judging by the chart for ITUB, it could honestly go either way. The stock has been mostly sideways for the past year. The red dots on the TTM\\_Squeeze indicate the price is currently consolidating. Once those dots turn green, there will be price movement, but that direction seems pretty unclear to me.

{"title": "Nasdaq (QQQ) going to drop bigly in the coming week(s)", "selftext": "Hello friends,\n\nLong time no see.\n\nIn this post I want to warn you that a big drop in QQQ is ahead of us.\n\nYou probably have seen those charts where people superimpose the current movements in the stock market against some older period (for example after the dot com bubble or the 2008 financial crisis). I did the same thing but in a more careful and systematic way.\n\nI define the \"current market\" starting from March 1, 2021 until today. That is 712 days (including weekends and holidays).\n\nThen I start from March 1999 (the earliest time where I can find QQQ data on Yahoo finance), pick the next 712 days of data (including weekends and holidays) and place them alongside the \"current market\" data in a way that the day of the week between the two series matches.\n\nThen I run the following regression:\n\nlog QQQ\\_new = a + b log QQQ\\_old + error\n\nand record the value of b (how closely the two series move).\n\nThen I shift the old series ahead by one week and repeat the above process.\n\nBy doing this, I find the period of time in the past that had the closest movements (in %, not in $ amount) to the current market. That period turns out to start from 1999-09-06 and end on 2001-08-17.

The green ones are the predictions made based on the old data. As you can see, whenever the red line (current) gets too far from the model prediction (green) it eventually gets back to it. In the past few weeks, the two lines have diverged too much and it's about time for them to cross roads again. That would mean a sharp decline (10% or more) in QQQ in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Y axis should be interpreted in %.
