{"title": "Considering a strategy", "selftext": "I\u2019m still new to options, doing mostly CCs with a few single leg moves, for roughly a year. Have had successes and quite a few burns and finally got the bug to learn and try some multi leg ideas. Wanted to ask for some feedback on my assessment and plan.\n\nI know $PLTR is meme zone but looks appropriate for this:\n\n$PLTR reports earnings AH Monday 2/13 with expected moves around 14%. CPI report is 2/14 AM. I think $PLTR is going to go down, and I also have the feeling CPI is going to add downward pressure too. \n\n(Concessions: I don\u2019t follow PLTR closely and my feeling on CPI is from overall sentiment.)\n\nConsiderations:\n\nI am wanting to practice a more buying-focused strategy. I\u2019ve had a higher *quantity* of selling wins and most of my losses by dollar amount have been on the buying side. \n\nIdeas:\n\nAny trade I\u2019d likely buy Monday, probably AM, and try to sell Tuesday but might shift based on how Tuesday goes. Looking at 2/17 expiration. I\u2019m sure IV will hit to an extent and probably should have bought in this past week and maybe could have even closed on Monday if IV rose enough. \n\n1) buy a put near-the-money or ATM. \n\n2) buy a straddle:\n     Looking at a slightly bearish straddle. Since movement projected is wide, a straddle seems like a smart play. The bullish protection would at least reduce loss if I am wrong. I know my risk is also if the underlying *doesn\u2019t* move as wide. I think picking a slightly bearish strike would help me if I\u2019m right on direction and wrong on degree of movement. \n\nSince I don\u2019t know $PLTR super well, I\u2019m also considering just picking an ATM straddle which would then limit risk to degree of movement. I\u2019ve also thought about augmenting an ATM straddle with also buying a slightly OTM put to tilt towards bearishness. I think I\u2019ve been burnt enough to know I\u2019m not great at predicting a direction when buying so far, so ATM and a second, cheap put could pick up a little more and for cheap. \n\nI thought if I sold multiple straddles ATM, I could also just buy a few OTM puts as well (e.g. buy 5 straddles, buy 3 OTM puts), but I think for this trade I\u2019m just going to set up for 1. \n\nI also decided against a strangle since the predicted move is wide and being a meme-ish stock in the current environment I think it will move big, and a strangle just doesn\u2019t seem profitable enough. Even selecting bearish strike positioning didn\u2019t seem worth it and would suffer IV crush worse. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to sell anything for this, but if so I could try a bear put spread I guess? \n\nI\u2019m working with smaller accounts and no margin currently so if you\u2019d like to suggest strategies for the future if I enabled those features/have more $ it would help for my learning too!\n\nThanks in advance!", "id": "10zvroa", "created_utc": 1676143877.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "You can create literally any strategy you want with options, but if you don\u2019t have a solid understanding of the underlying then you should definitely limit the strategies you employ.

I've been considering buying puts on PLTR on Monday as well. And I'm also bearish on CPI. I'm not a permabear. I play the direction I think things will go, and generally prefer calls over puts. For example, I like TSLA, but it went up 110% since Jan. 3rd. My \"gut\" was that it was overdue for a retrace. I also felt SPY was due to go down after I've seen so many big names go up after bad ERs. The market has been a paradox of late, and the greed index has been high for some time. Investing on instinct can work for you -  until it doesn't.\n\nMy thoughts (and mine alone).\n\n1. PLTR has a tendency to make big moves down on their ERs. Retail investors tend to have amnesia every PLTR ER. There is also a large number of bagholders that always cling to the hope the next ER will be \"the big one\". That being said, since none of us know what will be released, the next one can very well move up big so don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Because it generally makes big moves after ER, be prepared for your options to become worthless.\n2. While there are people that love the stock, there are an even larger group of people that absolutely hate PLTR (such as the WSB crowd). This is understandable given the constant dilution by PLTR.\n3. I suggest that you watch PLTR activity during the day and try to get an overall feeling of where it's going to trade going into market close and not get committed to purchasing in the AM. If it's starting to drop in the morning, then consider buying puts early. If it's moving up, then play the waiting game. There will likely be many people pumping on social media. You don't want to kick yourself buying puts in the morning only to watch them drop before the ER is even released.\n4. Keep in mind we've been in a kangaroo market, and Monday will likely be no exception. Don't be surprised or scared if you seem some crazy oscillation. If you want to get puts, then just make it your goal to try to get them as cheap as reasonably possible.\n5. I agree with your idea of Feb 17th options for PLTR. You're only  looking for a short-term hold and they'll be much cheaper. Time decay should not be your enemy if you sell them by Wednesday (see comment 12 below to see how time decay will work against you).\n6. I'm personally looking at buying ITM puts or slightly OTM puts if the strike price is already close to the share price. I find greed to work against me and most of the time when I lose, it's because I wanted to go too cheap on options or because I held them too long.\n7. Using some other options strategy is certainly an option - pun intended. I have a tendency to decide a direction and then play a strategy that will maximize if it plays as anticipated. But that's me. If I'm not feeling strongly about my play, then maybe I should be looking at other tickers instead of playing a strategy that will cap my return because I want to hedge my uncertainty.\n8. If CPI is bad, it will drag the entire market with it. If it is good, then PLTR can possibly go up even with bad ER. Just something to consider.\n9. I bought some UVXY calls Friday afternoon with a Feb 17th expiration to play CPI. I generally don't like holding UVXY over the weekend and probably should have waited until Monday, but I also considered the general sentiment of CPI being bad which could drop the market on Monday as people offload and go to cash until after CPI. Hence why I bought Friday afternoon. I only invested what I was willing to lose. Caveat Emptor: UVXY is usually a very bad idea to invest calls and should held for very short-term due to its intrinsic decay mechanic. Many people continually get UVXY puts for a steady income stream because it goes down over time by design. There are many that hate UVXY and prefer VIX or UVIX. But I can't trade VIX via Webull for some reason, and UVIX costs more. Hence why I chose UVXY. I probably should consider UVIX for future trades.\n10. There are some people that use UVXY or similar ETF to hedge their other plays. For example, UVXY puts with a long expiration just in case CPI is positive if someone is buying SPY puts believing it would be negative. I've never used it for hedging and it's likely employing an options strategy on a ticker is better than using an ETF to hedge.\n11. Keep in mind, AI stocks have been enjoying some positive movement thanks to ChatGPT, and PLTR has been lumped in with the AI crowd to some extent. In other words, they can possibly crank out a bad ER, but in their earnings guidance play up AI to sway the market.\n12. Model some trades on [OptionsProfitCalculator.com](https://OptionsProfitCalculator.com) if you want to consider other strategies. There are other such sites. It's just one that I like.\n13.
