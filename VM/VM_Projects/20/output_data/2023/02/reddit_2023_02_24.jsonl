Amazon was absolutely taking losses on amazon prime for a long time. But, now they have such a big subscriber base, that it works out for them. \n\nMy girlfriend worked as an amazon driver. I knew her wages, and I knew the rough amount of packages she was delivering daily. I'll just save you some time reading, but the net breakdown was it costs around $1 per package in labor, not including the costs for the vans and maintenance. \n\nAmazon prime is $15 per month. I would wager most of their subscribers are absolutely not ordering more then 15 packages per month. And even if they do, all of the subscribers that are ordering very little but keep it anyway for the occasional package + streaming service, are paying for the heavy users.\n\nThey come out ahead. I think walmart is trying to do something similar. Grow the user base enough that eventually that $13 a month will become profitable for them. They could also raise prices very slightly on all of the things being ordered through walmart+, say 1-2%, and many of their users wouldn't even notice.
