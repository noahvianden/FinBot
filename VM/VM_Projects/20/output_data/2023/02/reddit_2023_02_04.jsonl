We have lost a massive number of laborers through death and retirement. Those people havent been replaced on a 1 for 1 basis in many industries. Instead we have a lot of excess labor in some sectors and a substantial shortage in others. Take restaurants as an example. Many of the restaurants in my area have dramatically increased their prices or have reduced their capacity significantly. Why? Because the total number of people willing to work in that industry had dramatically declined. This labor shortage will continue for years. It will only resolve itself when the number of jobs in the industry declines to a point close to equilibrium with the existing labor force.\n\nThat is happening is basically every sector of the economy and will take years to shake out. This is a major sea change in the labor markets. It will resolve itself and there is little you, I or the fed can do to alter that reality. Once it had been resolved we will realize that the maximum capacity for many industries has declined while some will still be humming along just fine. That will be the new economic reality that will be exist for the next several decades. \n\nOnce that new equilibrium is reached we can expect to see a large amount of businesses have failed and we can expect that a large amount of other businesses are humming along just fine, but are no longer about to meet the existing demand without substantial changes. One example of this is truckers with the required cdl. This cdl holders as a demographic are older and generally as a group are less healthy than the average population. That means there will be a lot of them falling out of the workforce. They wont be replaced at anywhere near the same rate as they are leaving.

It makes great money and due to normal market oscillations you end up selling (and profiting from) the same strike multiple times in a day.

I think u/calevonlear suggests holding to expiration and taking assignment (or getting called away). If you are doing this on /ES or SPX, take the cash loss and just sell another ATM straddle.\n\nI've been running the numbers. I have SPX options data from 1990 to 2016 (I'm looking to procure more to present day). It's clear to me that aside from short periods of market dislocation (e.g. 2008 and 2009), the implied volatility is always greater than realized vol. That is, selling premium is your edge. Even when a massive dislocation occurs and you are 100+ points underwater, the next straddle you sell will likely profit. Keep selling on those big spikes down and you will make up for the losses on earlier trades stranded at higher strikes. The history shows this to be true. With the advent of daily expirations in SPX and /ES, the advantage has only grown. This approach actually worked when there were only a single *weekly* expiration plus the normal monthly. There was still enough premium to recover from big losses.\n\nAnyway, this isn't just a set-it-and-forget-it mechanical trade.

As for Tp I generally shoot for around 20-25% of premium. For defense I like to drop an ATM straddle at my original straddle breakeven. A close inside the zone will cause everything to cancel out. Or you can close all 4 legs for your original profit target. Another defense for a straddle is to gut it.

For the upper bollinger band, sell the covered call because the market will likely stall out or fall a bit.

For the standard short put ATM strategy you should be selling 5-7DTE. As the market rises and you hit your $250 target (5 points on /ES) then you take it off. Remember you are opening a short put at every strike divisible by 5 on the way up. These positions close every ~11 points so at max you'll have 3 units on.\n\n> 2. this makes sense to me in a sustained multi-day downtrend, but what would you do if it it's a multi-day or week period of consolidation with Vix < 30?

If it hasn't found a bottom yet, sell straddles. It will widen your buffer and with normal oscillation (even in a sell off) you'll hit your profit target and take it off.\n\nIn any sustained sell off, VIX will rise. I'm attaching a screenshot of VIX vs SP500 from the past 2 years. In every sell off the VIX has ended up in the high 20s or high 30s. If you're grinding out extrinsic every 1-2 days on covered calls or straddles, you will be collecting quite a bit of profit that you can use to offset your stranded puts. Rather than leave those puts stranded, just take assignment and sell calls until called away and then forget about them. Watch your account balance and don't worry about some old losers.\n\nhttps://snipboard.io/Sj0YBH.jpg\n\n> 3.

My impression from reading comments is the 0-1 DTE holds until expiry rather than take profit target for puts ATM.  That held some appeal to me due to less maintenance so I don\u2019t have to constantly take positions on and off intraday and overnight.  \n\nWith the 5-7 DTE and 25% TP, does that assume cascading down as well? (Eg put a position on on the 10\u2019s on the way down?). Otherwise how would you hit same strikes in the same day?  \n\nWith the straddles, that makes sense to me.

I don't like it as much as the 5-7DTE short put with a $250 profit target. I suppose it has its place... it likely works fine in a downtrending market.\n\n> With the 5-7 DTE and 25% TP, does that assume cascading down as well? (Eg put a position on on the 10\u2019s on the way down?). Otherwise how would you hit same strikes in the same day?\n\nGood question. I suppose this is a change from the original strategy that was described. I don't ladder on the 10s. I set a max position (usually 4) and put it on every 5 points. As the market takes off my positions, I have one more position I can put on if there's a retrace. A 25 point daily range that touches that high and low more than once will get you profit on the same strike(s).\n\n> If you\u2019re called away, but wanted to keep grinding down would you sell a naked call?\n\nNo. While a falling market is \"unlimited\" risk, I know where 0 is. On the upside, I have no idea where it will stop. I'm paranoid that way.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think i get it.

I think u/calevonlear would hold to expiration and take the assignment one way or the other and then double up the short on the opposite side. That is, if assigned long ES then sell a straddle plus sell one more call. The extra call is covered and the straddle is a separate position. If assigned a short ES, then sell a straddle plus sell one extra put. It's a covered put plus a straddle. I need to play with that idea some more.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "u/chuckremes wanted to follow-up on this thread.  i also have a couple of \"option theory\" questions I'm hoping u/calevonlear might weigh-in on as well.  \n\n\nFor the last two weeks (prior to yesterday) as the market slowly ground down, I've been selling ATM straddles with 25% TP and it worked like a charm. Yesterday the TP fired before Fed's dovish comments which sent the market up around 1 PM.  \n\n\n**Tactical question**\n\nYesterday (Thurs Mar 2) at close, not being sure that the uptrend would continue, I sold a straddle ATM.  Today (Fri Mar 3) was a monster up day, so even rolling down (up) my put, the delta was obviously insufficient to offset the delta exploding on the call.  My tactical question is this: *\"should I have sold puts not a straddle EOD Thurs? \" --* e.g. it was several slow red grind down days, but it seems like knowing **when** to transition from a straddle with a TP to writing puts and hyperwheeling or doing the 5 day $250 strategy makes all the difference.  How do you determine when to make this transition?  \n\n\n**Theory question**\n\nI've been using 1X notional whether puts or (technically) 2X notional on a straddle if you coun't both sides, but since they offset, it's actually 1X (at least in my book).  \n\nLet's say you are hyperwheeling OR the 5 day $250 cascade, even at 2X notional you will not be able to keep up with buy and hold because there is always slippage even if you rolled down (up) continuously to keep delta at .50.  If you hold the strike and roll the puts in a uptrend market, I can see how it slightly outperforms, but in this environment where it's stochastic, if you are grinding down your base constantly, I don't se how 2X notional would outperform, let alone 1X notional which I don't see any chance of outperforming buy and hold.  Am I thinking about this incorrectly?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sounds like you are doing pretty well. You probably don't need our help!\n\nRegarding your tactical question, there is no answer. You are looking to predict the future. No one can. The best you can probably do is just try and stay on the right side of the trend. There are a million ways to accomplish this... 20 SMA over 50 SMA, higher highs & higher lows, whatever. Pick a way to determine trend and just let it go.\n\nRegarding theory, a strategy that only ever has (at best) 50 delta long exposure will never outperform a 100 delta strategy in a sustained uptrend. However, we rarely see that.\n\nDo this as a thought experiment. Imagine the market has a 40 point range for a month. Some days it starts at the low and ends at the high and other days it's the opposite. At the end of the month, the close is the same as the month open. What does buy and hold return? Zero. What does this strategy return?\n\nNow project that forward for years.

How much notional are you using for straddles?  If 1X notional at 50 delta is really 1/2 notional, doesn\u2019t it make sense to run at 2X notional with puts or straddles? (2X for each side for straddles)\n\nGetting on the right side of the trend in the last month has been difficult as there isn\u2019t really a trend.  I\u2019ve found straddles working well at 25% TP even on FOMC days but on the (rare) occasion it breaks out of the profit cone, I find myself without conviction on the trend.  I haven\u2019t had to do the politician yet.  \n\nFor example, Friday when it was screaming up I aggressively rolled the unthreatened side up and doubled the unthreatened side puts with an early take profit as the market flattened.  That\u2019s not what I want to do as I don\u2019t have ability to actively manage like that most days.

I am hodling till the next bull market (maybe it is here?)", "selftext": "Hello everyone, this is my first post in WSB, so I thought it had to be legendary.\n\nI started trading back in 2016 with penny stocks (never doing this again, lol), so my journey began from buying pink sheet stocks to losing all my capital. So I stopped trading for a while. Fast forward 2020 crash, they cut my salary by 20%, so I decided to start trading again and took a Udemy trading course to start the right way. Then I decided to YOLO all my capital into airline companies like $AAL (thinking, when will we stop flying?), made 200-300% with my money, and started trading more seriously. I fell in love with trading so much that my emotions took over, and I no longer had management risk control. So I am holding a bag now and will HODL till my luck can change. Lesson learned for sure. I started averaging down the most significant position ($WISH), so let's see what the feature has for me.\n\nSafe trading, everyone :P.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/39t90141h8ga1.png?width=2032&format=png&auto=webp&s=0831dfb8876789cad6695b7f78b5f5c85ef5acc2", "id": "10tqpuh", "created_utc": 1675543309.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|38 minutes ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4578119218349457}, {"body": "Oh the old wish, I remember when it was 16$ and I was able to exit, thanks for reminding me I made a good choice", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Lesson learned for sure; good to read you were able to get out.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yea it was all over this sub for a long time, I remember seeing posts of people dropping 100k on it", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06878691911697388}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4242088198661804}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.31215953826904297}, {"body": "Fell in love with trading or might you have a gambling addiction?", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "A little of both, I believe, at the moment, you live, you learn.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24456250667572021}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4910426735877991}, {"body": "I am HODLing my 0dte until the next bull market", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.47446340322494507}, {"body": "Bull market is now", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Too bad OP is holding a bag of literal shit that might never go up", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Is it still a bag of shit after the Citron report?
