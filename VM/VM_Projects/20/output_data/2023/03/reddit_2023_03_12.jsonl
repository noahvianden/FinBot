{"title": "U.S Steel Due Dillegence", "selftext": "## TLDR: U.S. Steel is significantly overvalued because they are not able to reduce capital expenditures and are sensitive to economic conditions. IV is $277 million, company trading at $6.53 billion.\n\n## History\n\nU.S. Steel (USS) was founded in 1901 by Andrew Carnegie. It was at one point the largest company in the United States, credited with being a key driving force behind much of the development in the early 20th country in North America. Their product has notably been used to construct the Willis Tower, the United Nations building, NASA\u2019s vehicle assembly station, the New Orleans Superdome, among many other iconic structures.\n\nThey weathered the great depression by shifting towards consumer oriented production intended for use in household goods, as well as modernizing despite the economic conditions. During World War 2, USS\u2019s steel was used in the construction of ships, tanks, planes, and weapons. The company we see today was formed by a public offering and split of two companies in the early 2000\u2019s.\n\nStrategic acquisitions in 2003 and 2007, despite a tough steel industry, allowed USS to grow its capabilities. In 2018, they began an initiative called \u201cBest of Both\u201d, which is purposed to better serve customers with integrated and mini mill steelmaking technologies. In 2021 they announced the renaming of the initiative to \u201cBest of All\u201d, and added improvements to their environmental policy.\n\nToday, they have operations in the U.S and Europe. They are the 20th largest public steel company in the world with a market cap of $7.1 billion. As with almost all commodity businesses, we must consider operational costs and recurring investments. Steel requires steep capital expenditures, and comparing changes in these values to company decisions can be one factor determining if the company employs capital rationally.\n\nThey have an entire website dedicated to one of their facilities polluting Pittsburgh,[ https://pghcleanair.com/](https://pghcleanair.com/). In Pittsburgh alone they have been fined 6.65 million in the past 9 years. Social media posts about the company are overwhelmingly unfavorable, mostly citing unfavorable opinions about management and an abysmal environmental record.\n\n## Description\n\nThe current company has a production **capability** of 22.4 million tons. Their typical customer is in the automotive, construction, consumer packaging/appliance, electrical, industrial, or energy field. The four segments of the company are:\n\n\\-  Flat rolled\n\n\\-  Mini mill\n\n\\-  Tubular\n\n\\-  European operations\n\nFlat rolled is averaging 67% of capacity, producing 8.8 million tonnes last year. Mini mill is averaging 80% capacity at 2.7 million tonnes. European operations produce 3.8 million tonnes at 76% capacity. Tubular is averaging 70% capacity at 634 tonnes. This amounts to a total utilization of 71%.\n\nThe \u201cBest for All\u201d strategy the company is urgently using as their mantra boils down to cutting costs and gaining competitive advantages.\n\nDavid Burritt has been CEO since 2017. He is optimistic for a company generally considered to be in decline. Only half of the company thinks he is a good CEO. To set the stage, steel prices increased at the beginning of 2021, and remained at a level above 50% of the previous for almost the entire year. He described declining business in 2022 compared to the record year of 2021. Prior to the war, they bought inputs from Russia and have since been purchasing from other sources.\n\n## Finance\n\nIn the 2010\u2019s, USS struggled to stay profitable. The past two years have been exceptional. Assets have nearly doubled and the company has built up a sizable cash position, despite the shortfalls of management, the company is in a favorable position. Good times come to an end, revenue is down 20% from last quarter, and net income is down over 80%, due to the company inability to keep COGS at a competitive relationship with revenue. The current financial results are indicative of the pre 2021 bump. The recurring, high, and predictable capital expenditures of the company should be considered part of operating cash flows. They have only had three years of positive return on equity prior to 2020 and following 2010.\n\nThe randomness of the capital expenditures and recurring large costs creates a strange situation. The company performance cannot be determined from looking at one-year cycles, instead the horizon must be extended to explain why some years the company has exceptional earnings. Instead, we must look at the balance sheet structure, and long-term averages to understand the direction of the company.\n\nSignificant implications can be drawn from U.S. Steels performance in 2007-2008. 2007 was a record year, and the company experienced a 50%+ drop in revenue. Net income went from over $2 billion to $1.4 billion in the red. A run up on assets before 2008 was almost symmetrical to the slow bleeding experienced after, 2004 and 2014 have similar looking balance sheets. The company issues share and was forced to reduce investment. The company was in a fight for its survival, and the actions to prevent catastrophe had long term consequences. The company is extremely exposed to economic volatility, and revenue fluctuates but does not show promising long-term growth. This is a mature company.\n\n|Metric|Most Recent Value|30-year average|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|ROE|25.5%|3.7%|\n|ROA|14.2%|1.8%|\n|Profit Margin|12%|0.8%|\n|D/E|0.39|1.07|\n|Net income per employee|$111,000|$9,000|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe company is in an exceptional position. There is a possibility for them to return tremendous value to shareholders, but there is also the possibility that the company attempts to grow their operations where it is clearly not in their best interests to do so. If there was a single action that this company should do, it is to reduce capital expenditures, which is the highest utility, both to the shareholders and the company\u2019s future outlook.\n\nWhat is certain is that the company will not see years like 2021 and 2022 in the foreseeable future. In constructing the DCF, we must account for the current position by making a positive adjustment. The company cash flow is trending downwards without the past two years, but slightly upwards with one. The premium for high performance in the past two years will be to assume the ability to increase free cash flow slightly in the next ten years, at a rate of half a percent yoy. Assuming we use the $28 million recommended by taking the average if the past (highly cyclical) decade, and using our half percent growth rate, and a decaying risk free rate from 4% to 0% over 10 years (a relative mean reversion to target inflation), we reach an **intrinsic value of $277 million**, which is less than 5% of the market value. \n\nU.S. Steel is significantly overvalued, and they struggle to improve cash flows because they are unable to reduce capital expenditures. The fallacy of the current company standings encourages conservative investors who do not do in dept research. Unless there is a technological breakthrough in steel fabrication, this company will not improve their intrinsic value.", "id": "11p1thp", "created_utc": 1678585607.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "First off, I am always open to changing my mind and learning something I did not know.

It is extremely capital intensive, most of their expenditures are on maintaining and acquiring assets. US Steel is operating at 70% capacity, so the remaining 30% that needs to be maintained/depreciated is an enormous capital drain.\n\nIf they were liquidated today, it is hard to say what the balance sheet will be worth with immobile steel plants and blast furnaces in different stages of their lifetimes. Like I said, there is a possibility that there is deep value in their assets, but from the research I did, I think their large balance sheet could be a negative because of the capital intensity.\n\nAny thoughts on this?", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "They won't need to liquidate with only $500m net debt, which isn't bad for a commodity company.   \n\nThey have been talking about capex in the last call and transitioning to electric arc furnaces which can make steel from 100% scrap metal. This kind of initiative will reduce capex and carbon dependence. It's politically an easy sell for an administration in the US that wants to build out infrastructure \"and commit to using iron, steel, and construction materials produced in the United States.\" (from CHIPS Act). \n\nAccording to their last presentation, most of their current spending plan projects end in 2024, which should free up money for dividends and buybacks.

Everything he does is relatively closely watched. The data he uses is used by tons of firms and whatnot. Great tool and worth time getting to know what it all offers.\n\nOn the valuation side, he has many books. Though in my valuations class in undergrad we all read *Damoradan on Valuation: Security Analysis for Investment and Corporate Finance*. It is a **THICK** book, but it is the backbone of modern valuation techniques. It is like the valuation bible. He has other books that you can read as well, but this is probably the best to start with. **Note: The book recommendation is only to those who have a decent understanding of financial analysis**. **If not, understand financial analysis first and become proficient with excel as well.**\n\nTypes of Models: Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF); Free Cash Flow to Equity (FCFE), Residual, Dividend Discount 1 Stage and Mult-Stage Models (DDM), etc. \n\nIn the end, the idea behind financial modeling comes down to understanding time value of money.

{"title": "Saudi oil giant Aramco posts record $161 billion profit for 2022", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/12/saudi-oil-giant-aramco-posts-record-161point1-billion-profit-for-2022.html\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s state-controlled oil giant Aramco on Sunday reported a record net income of $161.1 billion for 2022 \u2014 the largest annual profit ever achieved by an oil and gas company.\n\nAramco said net income increased 46.5 percent over the year, from $110 billion in 2021. Free cash flow also reached a record $148.5 billion in 2022, compared with $107.5 billion in 2021. \n\n\u201cThis is probably the highest net income ever recorded in the corporate world,\u201d Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said on a Sunday earnings call. \n\nThe results are nearly triple the profit that oil major ExxonMobil posted for 2022, bolstered by soaring oil and gas prices through last year, along with higher sale volumes and improved margins for refined products. \n\nOil and gas prices surged at the start of 2022, with western sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine steadily tightening access to Moscow\u2019s supplies, particularly seaborne crude and oil products.\n\nOil prices have since pulled back more than 25% year-on-year, with hot inflation and rising interest rates overshadowing a more bullish demand outlook from China. Brent and WTI prices fell 6% last week alone. Brent last traded at around $80 dollars per barrel. \n\n\u201cWe are cautiously optimistic,\u201d Nasser said. \u201cIf you consider China opening up, the pickup in jet fuels and the very limited spare capacity, we are cautiously optimistic in the short to mid-term [that] markets will remain tightly balanced.\u201d\n\nAramco raised its fourth-quarter dividend by 4% to $19.5 billion, to be paid in the first quarter of 2023. Aramco also said it would issue bonus shares to eligible shareholders as a result. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re aiming to sustain [the dividend] at this level,\u201d Aramco Chief Financial Officer Ziad Al-Murshed told the earnings call. \u201cWe have the financial strength to go through the ups and downs of the cycle.\u201d\n\nNasser also used the results release to repeat his warning about \u201cpersistent underinvestment\u201d in the hydrocarbons sector. \n\n\u201cGiven that we anticipate oil and gas will remain essential for the foreseeable future, the risks of underinvestment in our industry are real, including contributing to higher energy prices,\u201d Nasser said on Sunday, echoing comments made during a recent interview with CNBC.\n\nAt both a ministerial and Aramco level, Saudi Arabia has been a proponent of avoiding short-term fuel shortages through the dual funding of fossil fuel supplies and the green transition.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see enough investment getting into the markets right now,\u201d he reiterated on the Sunday call. \u201cWe encourage the industry, policymakers, investors\u2026 to avail additional investment to really increase the amount in the sector, so that we can meet future demand.\u201d\n\nAramco said average hydrocarbon production last year was 13.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, including 11.5 million barrels per day of total liquids. Saudi Arabia most recently produced 10.39 million barrels per day of crude oil in January, the International Energy Agency found in the February issue of its Oil Market Report.\n\nAs chair of the influential OPEC+ producers\u2019 alliance, Saudi Arabia has been leading by example the group\u2019s efforts to collectively reduce their output targets by 2 million barrels per day, agreed in October and reaffirmed at technical and ministerial meetings since. The group\u2019s move towards limiting supply availabilities has put OPEC+ at odds with some international consumers, sparking a war of words with Washington towards the end of the last year, as U.S. President Joe Biden\u2019s administration stressed the need to easing the burden on households.\n\nLong-time rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran on Friday struck a China-brokered deal to resume diplomatic relations. Iran has previously been blamed for a major attack on Aramco\u2019s facilities in 2019 that caused a dramatic spike in prices and undermined the stability of global supplies. Tehran has denied involvement.\n\n\u201cThe deal will hopefully result in less geopolitical tension and enhance regional stability, which will definitely have a positive impact on the global market,\u201d Nasser said in response to a question about the Saudi-Iran development.\n\nThe company reaffirmed it would continue to invest to increase its maximum production capacity to 13 million barrels a day by 2027.\n\nCapital expenditure rose by 18% to $37.6 billion last year, and is expected to increase to $45 billion to $55 billion in the coming years, anticipating increases \u201cuntil around the middle of the decade.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur focus is not only on expanding oil, gas and chemicals production, but also investing in new lower-carbon technologies with potential to achieve additional emission reductions in our own operations and for end users of our products,\u201d Nasser said.", "id": "11prsna", "created_utc": 1678659699.0, "score": 93, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "Among the clusterf*** that Monday will be, the oil sector will be primed for adds to my LT account", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3436633348464966}, {"body": "Predators took advantage of an inflation scenario and profited.", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "But doesn\u2019t Biden control gas prices?", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "No?
