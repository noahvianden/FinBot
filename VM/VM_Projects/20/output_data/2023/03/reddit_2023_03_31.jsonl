In the 70s rates were 13-15% with some individuals with poorer credit having to pay 18% interest. Interest rates increased to battle inflation. This suppressed profits for businesses that couldn\u2019t borrow money as easily and expand. Thus the reason stock market returns were low. \nIn the 90s you had inflation, not as quite high, and interest rates were not raised as aggressively. There was also the technology boom, the first time in modern era where tech came to the forefront. Were companies as refined as they are now when mentioning tech? Absolutely not. Pets.com and Juno as well as AOL can\u2019t hold a candle to the behemoths like Google and Facebook now which are profit machines, however many invested in this new era. It was similar to the Bitcoin fiasco where everyone who didn\u2019t understand markets, what they were investing in, etc jumped in and invested. For example, my dad who doesn\u2019t know much English, worked a blue color job, never read an earnings report and had no business investing in individual stocks because he didn\u2019t know how to make trades had a friend invest in the market for him and manage it. He made $80k from a $20k investment in a short time frame and then lost all $100k shortly after. So while you had decreasing inflation and high rates in the 90s the markets were responding differently because money was flowing into the markets at an unprecedented rate because word got around tech was the future and everyone including the trucker driving cross country was going to be a millionaire.\nThe federal reserve also has other ways to stimulate or slow down the economy. Interest rates are only one factor. Anyway, one example is that they could lower the amount banks have to hold in deposits, allowing for banks to lend more heavily which helps circulate money into the economy. All of those factors matter, because the bank lends more money to an individual business to expand, the business hires more workers who make a wage, they buy items with that paycheck that create profits for a specific company such as McDonald\u2019s or Coca Cola.

The Federal Reserve, under Paul Volcker's leadership, aggressively raised interest rates to combat inflation. By the mid-1980s, inflation rates had fallen significantly, and the stock market experienced a bullish period known as the \"Reagan bull market,\" with the S&P 500 index growing substantially during this time.\n\nReduced inflation can ease the pressure on input costs for companies, leading to improved profitability and higher stock prices. For instance, when inflation falls, companies that rely on commodities like oil or metals for production may see a decrease in their input costs, which can subsequently boost their profit margins and make their stocks more attractive to investors.\n\nAdditionally, when inflation decreases, central banks may maintain or lower interest rates, as seen in the early 2000s when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in response to the dot-com bubble and 9/11 attacks.
