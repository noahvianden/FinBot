{"title": "Banks At Risk Of Failure Due To HTM Losses & High Amount Of Uninsured Deposits (Similar To SVB/SBNY)", "selftext": "I put out a note yesterday showing the HTM losses as a percent of equity. This scan showed banks in descending order from largest losses to smallest (didn't show big banks). What I have for you all today is the HTM losses relative to equity for the largest banks in the world. For context this simply means that these banks have large exposures to unbooked losses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6zo0n25qyroa1.jpg?width=1340&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a48fe39a84c49ca6477b7392540526526f2aacaa\n\nAs you can see out of the big four banks Bank of America is the worst off with losses as their security losses account for nearly half of their equity. Out of the group JPM is in the best spot with losses only accounting for 12% of equity. \n\nVery interestingly some banks have zero HTM losses such as capital one and TD bank Fifth third American express. Although they have available for sale losses which is just basically the bank saying they are actively looking to sell these assets rather than hold to maturity. \n\nAlthough we are becoming a little numb to these high HTM losses, keep in mind it only took 9.5% to take down signature bank. What really did them in was their deposit base which was 89% uninsured. The combination of HTM losses and a high base of uninsured depositors is the typical recipe for a bank run and subsequent failure. Now when we look at this HTM losses combined with our scan of banks with high uninsured deposit bases we can see some firms that look to be in serious danger of going under. I have listed them In order of failure risk IMO. Bank Of NY Mellon Has 23% in HTM losses as % of equity if you added their AFS losses it would be nearly double that, but for this exercise ill just focus on HTM losses. The scary part is 96% of its deposit base is uninsured. So if those depositors don't feel safe given they wont be covered by the FDIC they may start to demand their money which is the definition of a bank run. \n\n* Northern TC has HTM losses that are 20% of equity and 83% of deposit base is uninsured. \n* Citi bank has HTM losses that are 15% of equity and 77% of deposit base is uninsured. \n* First Republic has HTM losses that are 27% of equity and 67% of the deposit base is uninsured. \n* Huntington Bank has HTM that are 13.5% of equity and 55% of the deposit base is uninsured. \n\nSeeing news now that UBS is buying Credit Suisse which is for sure a good sign for markets. But it doesn't solve the underlying problem, which is that many banks bought long dated US treasuries in 2020 once they got an influx of cash due to free money policies. Rates have risen over 800% since then and are causing massive losses within bond portfolios.

The ECB declined to comment. The Fed had no comment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA further selloff in banks could erode confidence depositors have in their lenders.

{"title": "Lyft stock analysis and valuation - Why it is down almost 90%", "selftext": "This post summarizes my analysis of Lyft. \n\nI hope you enjoy reading it and feel free to add your take and agree/disagree with what's mentioned below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe post is divided into the following sections:\n\n* Introduction\n* Historical financial performance\n* The balance sheet\n* The main problem\n* Assumptions & valuation\n* Valuation based on assumptions different than mine\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThose who are in the US are for sure familiar with Lyft. How I'd describe it in one sentence, is \"Uber's little brother\". \n\nIt offers a ride-sharing marketplace, but also vehicles for hire, motorized scooters, bicycle sharing, and other services related to transportation.\n\nThe company became public back in March 2019, which means within 4 years, its share price got a significant haircut (down almost 90%). The market cap is close to $4 billion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Historical financial performance**\n\nOne thing that is in common for most companies that have gone public is:\n\n\\- They have a big story that grabs the attention of the investors (and makes them feel that if they don't invest, they'd be missing out)\n\n\\- They have had a good financial performance for the last few years\n\nLyft was no different. Take a look at the revenue growth prior to the IPO:\n\n2017 - 209%\n\n2018 - 103% (reaching almost $2.2 billion in revenue)\n\nWhat can one expect from a such high-growth company in the future? Probably something comparable, right? Well, between 2018 and 2022, the revenue grew at CAGR (\"Compounded annual growth rate\") of 17%. Here's the breakdown:\n\n2019 - 68% (Still good!)\n\n2020 - negative 35% (due COVID-19)\n\n2021 - 36%\n\n2022 - 28% (reaching almost $4.1 billion in revenue)\n\nOf course, we can point to COVID-19 for the disruption of revenue growth, but the average analysts' forecast is 10% revenue growth in the coming years.\n\nSo we have a company that started with a big growth story which is no longer there.\n\nTo make things a bit worse, the gross margin of 40% isn't sufficient to cover the operating expenses that are close to double the gross margin. This means Lyft needs to cut its operating expenses in half only to break even. Are they making progress on that topic? Let's take a look at the operating expenses as % of revenue in 2018 (prior to the IPO and COVID-19) and 2022:\n\nOperations and support: Decreased from 16% --> 11%\n\nResearch and development: Increased from 14% --> 21%\n\nSales & Marketing: Decreased from 37% --> 13%\n\nGeneral & Administrative: Increased from 21% --> 31%\n\n**Total: Decreased from 88% to 76%**\n\nThis seems all over the place, some expenses are better managed, others a bit worse. Again, as mentioned above, they need to reduce to 40% only for Lyft to break even.\n\nThe company is yet to find its way to profitability and for the year 2022, its operating margin was -36%. From its operations, Lyft was losing over $1bn/year! For comparison, its market cap is under $4 billion now.\n\nOf course, this is where share-based compensation comes into play. A big chunk of the operating expenses, related to the employees and the management was paid in shares. In fact, since 2018, the # of shares outstanding has increased by 32%! If we use the share price back at the time when these shares were earned, that amounts to $3.5 billion only in the last 4 years.\n\nThe # of shares outstanding has been increasing between 5% and 10% every year!\n\nIf the employees and the management do not believe in Lyft, they're going to sell these shares, which brings the price down even more.\n\nIf we adjust for this non-cash expense, Lyft is losing around $300 million from its operations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The balance sheet**\n\nOne of the questions that always arise in money-losing companies is \"Is this company going bankrupt?\".  \n\nI don't think this is likely to happen in the next few years. Lyft has cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments of over $2.8 billion, while the total debt (including leases) is around $1 billion. This net cash position is sufficient to sustain the losses for quite some time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The main problem**\n\nWe have a company that is struggling to find its path to profitability and doesn't have huge growth ahead. So what can the management do? Oh yes, a LOYALTY program! This is oftentimes the proposed solution to such a problem for a company that is in a competitive environment. But this actually highlights the real problem within the ride-sharing industry.\n\nThere's absolutely no stickiness. If I put myself in the shoes of a customer or a driver, why would I use Lyft (or Uber) if another company offers better prices? There's nothing stopping customers or drivers to switch from one company to the other at moment.\n\nYes, a loyalty program sounds good, but it isn't free. Any discount would lead to retaining customers, but it also means less revenue for the company. Ultimately, Lyft would be the one paying that price, which doesn't help its journey to profitability.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Assumptions and valuation**\n\nFor anyone that doesn't see a company becoming profitable, well, there makes no sense to go through the exercise of running a DCF valuation. I am going to run this exercise as there are always readers with different views than mine. I'll start with one scenario:\n\n1. **Revenue**: Growing at 10% for the next 5 years, then declining to 3% by year 10 (This leads to revenue doubling in 10 years time)\n2. **Operating margin**: Break-even at year 5, increasing to 8% by year 10\n3. **Discount rate**: 11.61% --> Reducing to 9.94% as time goes by and the company becomes profitable\n\nAfter adjusting for everything that's on the balance sheet as well as the outstanding equity options, the outcome is close to **$1.8 billion ($4.7/share)**\n\nThis is roughly half of the current market cap of $3.8 billion ($10.60/share).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Valuation based on assumptions different than mine**\n\n Let's take a look at how the valuation changes if we use different assumptions (also, under which assumptions the company is fairly valued today).\n\nBelow is a table that shows the fair value per share, based on different assumptions related to the revenue 10 years from now as well as the operating margin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Revenue / Operating margin|6%|8%|10%|12%|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|75% ($7.2b)|$3.4|$4.6|$5.9|$6.9|\n|100% ($8.2b)|$3.3|$4.7|$6.0|$7.7|\n|150% ($10.2b)|$3.2|$4.7|$7.0|$9.7|\n|200% (12.3b)|$2.6|$5.4|$8.2|$11.4|\n\nAt today's share price of roughly $10.60/share, to be fairly valued, Lyft needs to grow its revenue by 150-200% in 10 years' time and reach an operating margin of 12%.\n\nThe big story that evolves around autonomous driving and the idea that Lyft will be able to capitalize on that is still there. However, they're not the only company that is aiming at that. It's not only its big brother Uber as well. There's Tesla, other car manufacturers, and Apple/Amazon are always there to jump at an opportunity.\n\nAs always, thank you for reading the posts, and until next week for the next valuation.", "id": "11vwcq0", "created_utc": 1679257056.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "as a 6 year driver, it has been decreasing in quality the ENTIRE time.\n\nThey cut pay by 30% in my region 2 months ago, which is absolutely brutal. \n\nLots of passengers tell me i'm the first driver in 3 or 4 rides, that speaks English.\n\nWhat used to pay 25-40$ consistently pays 12-17$/hr now, they are bleeding drivers and customers.\n\nThis shit is a dumpster fire, avoid at all costs.", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "What about Uber?

I did uber and in the span of 5 hours on a busy night, I could easily put 200-300 miles on my car, even driving in downtown areas. It was constant driving. I might take someone 30 minutes home from a bar, and then to get back to that bar, I'd have to drive 15 minutes left or right, pick them up, and drive north or south back to the same bar. Even in a gas efficient car, the cost of gas as well as setting aside money for maintenance, was a big factor in what I made.\n\nI ultimately quit because I don't think that it's worth it as a driver. I could make more money gross by working as a pizza delivery person then uber in most cases. Not to mention the risk to my life of carrying people I don't know, late at nights, etc, and they lose a lot of money paying out driver incentives. I would also put less miles on my car as well.\n\nThis is just an anecdotal example, but I think a lot of people felt the same way. You could GROSS a LOT as an uber driver, driving at the right times, but you had to pay a lot out to maintaining your car (or even repeatedly buying new ones if you were a full timer). I knew plenty of drivers that could make $80K a year, but would have to be driving an expensive SUV and doing uber black to make that. One guy in particular told me he pretty much had to buy a new car every year to year and a half to gross that, while working 60 hour weeks.\n\nSo, in summary...uber spent a lot of money trying to acquire and keep drivers, and most people that do it realize it's not really worth it. Uber might make a lot on the drivers that they can keep, but they spend a lot of money on incentives up front to get people to drive for them. \n\nUnfortunately, new drivers get used to those crazy incentives and think they can make huge bank doing it.

Even my best days I only made $50 gross, most people didn\u2019t tip.\n\nMost of the drivers I\u2019d get rides from loved it and had been doing it for years with no plans to stop.

Buckle up, because it's time to talk about a stock that's primed for some explosive gains. \n\nNVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), the unstoppable GPU powerhouse that's about to see gaming revenues skyrocket, despite the hurting crypto industry.\n\nCrypto Who? \ud83e\udd14\nWhile it's true that NVIDIA has dipped its toes into the crypto waters with their Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) product line, don't let the current crypto slump fool you. In Q1 2021, CMP sales accounted for only $155 million, about 2.74% of NVIDIA's total revenue of $5.66 billion. That's peanuts compared to their gaming segment, which brought in a whopping $2.76 billion or 49% of the total revenue. So even if the crypto industry takes a hit, NVDA's bottom line remains resilient, and they're ready to dominate the gaming market.\n\nGaming Revenues: Ready for Lift-off \ud83d\ude80\nIn the past five years, NVIDIA has seen a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 20%, and with a new generation of gaming consoles and blockbuster games hitting the shelves, the demand for high-performance GPUs is about to skyrocket. NVIDIA's GeForce GPUs are gamers' top choice, and we all know that the gaming market is booming. Global gaming industry revenue is projected to reach $196 billion by 2022, up from $159.3 billion in 2020. As more people turn to gaming for entertainment, NVIDIA is poised to reap the rewards, translating into juicy gains for us degenerate apes.\n\nCloud Gaming: The Next Frontier \ud83c\udf0c\nCloud gaming is gaining traction, and NVIDIA is already ahead of the game with its GeForce NOW platform. The cloud gaming market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 48.2% from 2021 to 2028, reaching $7.24 billion by 2028. As more gamers shift to cloud gaming, NVIDIA's gaming revenues will further soar, making the crypto industry's struggles look like a minor speed bump on the road to the moon.\n\nSo, fellow degenerates, strap in and prepare for takeoff, because NVDA is ready to show the world that the gaming industry's gains will overshadow any crypto woes. Remember, this ain't financial advice, and always do your own research. But don't be surprised if we're all partying on the moon with our sweet, sweet NVDA tendies. \ud83c\udf15\ud83c\udf57", "id": "11vlkut", "created_utc": 1679232861.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|11 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/SlenderMan69, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: NVIDIA is a GPU powerhouse that's about to see gaming revenues skyrocket, despite the hurting crypto industry.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "NVIDIA is being pumped by the present AI craze because GPUs are the best drivers of deep learning.\n\nAnd this dude is talking about the video game market.
