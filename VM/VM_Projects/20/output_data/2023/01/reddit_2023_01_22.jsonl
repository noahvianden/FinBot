See Jinko Solar and Canadian Solar stock on 01/11/2023.\n\nTesla stock will likely immediately plunge after market close on Wednesday 01/26/2023 before quickly recovering and gaining momentum going into the earnings conference call. This is because Banks will be looking to capitalize on bearish bias against the stock before the stock price moves to the fair market value going into the earnings call.\n\nBetween 4:00 and 4:15 PM, there would be an opportunity to buy 0 day expiry put options on SPY while Tesla stock moves downwards followed by buying of 0 day expiry call options on SPY as Tesla stock makes its recovery.
