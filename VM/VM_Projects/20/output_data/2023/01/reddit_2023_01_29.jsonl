Buffet is obviously legendary, but also operated in a time pre-internet, pre hedge fund computers trading at rapid pace, etc., that really gave him a distinct advantage.  I just looked at some charts really quick, so this is certainly not indicative of the entire life span of these by any means:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1981 - Berk 31.76, SP500 -9.73\n\n1982 - Berk 38.39, SP 14.76\n\n1983 - Berk 69.03, SP 17.27\n\n1984 - Berk -2.67, SP 1.40\n\n1985 - Berk 93.73, SP 26.33\n\nI know I will probably get some flak for 'cherry picking' these years, but I put these years down because the chart I pulled up only went back to 1981 for BRK.  Perhaps other years will give a different perspective, I realize that.  But in those 5 years, Buffet absolutely destroyed the SP500.  I think what most people are concerned with is what will happen moving forward, not what happened in the early 80's that may have given BRK a significant advantage over SP over the course of its entire lifespan.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo get a little better perspective, I then pulled a comparison over the last 20 years, comparing BRK A with SPY fund, total returns.  I think the dividends in SPY help out significantly to close the gap, and even overtake BRK in 3 of the 4 sets of 5 year increments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast 5 years - BRK 45.29, SPY 55.21\n\nLast 10 years - BRK 220.34, SPY 225.49\n\nLast 15 years - BRK 239.6, SPY 302.7\n\nLast 20 years - BRK 600.45, SPY 593.75\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHopefully my numbers are correct.

{"title": "The case for recession & why retail spending is now more important than inflation.", "selftext": "The BEA recently announced its US GDP findings for Q4 of 2022.  On Page 18, a clear pattern can be seen when evaluating nominal change to consumer spending and business investments.\n\n*Exhibit 1 (\\*1)*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h5xqy2mg31fa1.png?width=2264&format=png&auto=webp&s=41ee7b3db5f994c76ea541ddcaa9b0a7cc42ac4a\n\nPersonal Consumption expenditures (green) are all the goods and services consumers purchase.    Exhibit 1 shows that consumer  spending has been slowing dramatically since a high in Q2 of 2021.\n\nGross Private Domestic Investment (blue) is the amount of capital US business invest to create growth.  **Exhibit 1 shows over the last 4 quarters US businesses have dramatically decreased the capital they are spending as consumer spending has declined**.\n\nIt is estimated that 70% of GDP comes from personal consumption and 18% comes from business investments.   We can clearly see that US companies have dramatically decreased investments as consumer spending has declined.   A combined 88% of US GDP is showing signs of slowing or decline.\n\nWith 29% of the S&P reporting earnings as of January 27, FactSet reports that earnings are continuing to fall.  Currently, earnings are tracking to -5.0% with 69% of companies reporting a beat with a margin of 1.5%.  These rates are both well below the 5 year historical averages of 77% and 8.6% (\\*2).\n\nBased on current earnings and investments, it is clear US growth is stalling.  As US companies try to hit declining EPS targets, they will continue to pull back on investments and may shift to larger rounds of layoffs.  If US companies shift to larger rounds of layoffs, consumer spending will decline further.\n\nWe can further evaluate the health of US companies and the future of the US economy by looking at US inflation from the January 27 PCE report in Exhibit 2.\n\n*Exhibit 2 (\\*3)*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/13pnj0mi31fa1.png?width=2298&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0b0576598f63e0c257f4b55cd9d10a6721b7162\n\nExhibit 2 shows goods price inflation (red) has been falling for the last 6 months.  However, during the last 8 months services inflation remains sticky and sideways.    Annualizing a 4-month period in two segments over the last 8 months (green: May \u2013 Aug, blue: Sep \u2013 Dec) we find that services inflation has remained constant at 5.4% annualized (sum of 4 months = 1.8% \\* 3 = 5.4%).\n\n**With a sideways inflation of 5.4% for services, we can expect the Federal Reserve to keep monetary policy tight**.  Sideways services is an indication that if the Fed were to take its foot off the interest rate brake, inflation could become elevated again.\n\nFurthermore, caution should be emphasized when evaluating the decreasing goods inflation rate as energy has been largely responsible for a top line decrease (purple). *The top line decrease in energy inflation is hiding services inflation*.  If energy inflation were to increase again, the economy and equities markets will incur a sharp decline.   Chinese oil demand and aviation fuel demand will be important factors in the future of energy prices.\n\nWith goods inflation continuing to decrease (for now?) and Fed policy likely to stay tight due to sideways services inflation \u2013 *US companies will face increased margin pressure due to a decreased ability for consumers to pay higher prices for goods.*  Consumers will need to balance paying for goods and paying for necessary services like health care which remain inflated.  Consumer spending may further shift downward as US households begin to save for a recession, increasing the likelihood of a recession.\n\nTo evaluate the US economy and its trajectory, we should begin to focus on Retail Spending to evaluate cash flows for US companies.    In Exhibit 3, we can see that consumer spending declined -1.0% in November and -1.1% in December.\n\n*Exhibit 3 (\\*4)*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/97e1h5hj31fa1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=d265d8feccf45d6db5729c73556f6a015d4205d0\n\nIf sales continue to decline, US retail companies will be squeezed as revenue drops and labor costs stay high.  To cut costs, US retail companies will increase layoffs and those layoffs will infect other industries.\n\nIf we do not see layoffs from US companies, US equity earnings will fall faster due to increased margin pressure that brings forward an \u201cEarnings recession\u201d.\n\nIn summary, Retail Sales will show if consumer spending will continue to decline.  Inflation as the leading driver of equity values becomes less important as 1) an increase in inflation only further causes more tightness in Fed monetary policy and further reduces consumer spending or 2) a decrease in Goods Inflation causes greater margin pressure for US companies and consumer spending declines.  Any rally in equities will be transitory as an earnings recession becomes increasingly more obvious.\n\n**A note for future consideration**\n\nWhen evaluating unemployment, we should consider if the metric we are using is counting correctly.  Due to the way the US Department of Labor counts U3, portions of U6 may be \u201cReal unemployment\u201d that are not being counted in U3 due to \u201ctechnical\u201d counting reasons.  More research will be done to understand unemployment.\n\nLastly, a reason we may not have seen the layoffs typically associated with a recession is that companies have chosen to cut Cap Ex before Op Ex due to difficulties hiring in 2021/2022.  This can be inferred from the nominal GDP decrease we see in Private Business Investments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\n\\*1.

Some of it's in longer term bonds, so that's not coming back right away. There's a lot of uncertainty around how much the Fed will draw down on the balance sheet, with some people guessing a full reset down to 2019 levels, but I would say the pain to get there relative to the gain is not going to allow for that to happen... and current Fed projects indicate that there's no appetite to restrict to reduce the money supply to that extent, reducing the pull-forward from like 10 years to a couple of years is probably enough...\n\n...which still leaves the banks cash-flush and with lots of money to re-enter the market that institutions began pulling out in 2021.\n\nOnce stock return projections get higher than the risk-free rate of return again, that should float the P/E ratios up higher than the expected 2019 baseline.  Of course individual equities will have their own dynamics, but the flow of the market will also dictate to some extent whether they have strength or not.\n\nIn other words, current market pricing could be based in an overly pessimistic view relative to the amount of capital that will be looking for a home in a market reversal... it's safe for them now to take a risk-averse approach, and not wrong to do so given the unknowns... but the reasoning behind their argument regarding P/E ratios has a blindspot.\n\nEdit to add: Prior to the 1990s, the range on the P/E ratio is tighter, in part, because money expansion was generally tighter and because Glass-Steagall meant that more of that M2 expansion made it into the real economy, meaning the 'E' part of 'P/E' was more likely to scale with stock pricing.\n\nWhat happened in the 1990s other than an explosion in investment speculation and a bit of a change in monetary policy and a tech bubble? GLBA and Glass-Steagall were repealed, which opened the doors to more intermingling  of S&L and investment house funding.
