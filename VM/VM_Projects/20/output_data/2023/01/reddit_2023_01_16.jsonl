{"title": "CREDIT SPREAD FOR WEEKLY INCOME", "selftext": "So I've been wanting to do this for a long time but never really had enough capital until now.  I have done a lot of research on the subject though and use excel to figure out the nitty and gritty details.  Basically what I'm planning on doing is selling 1 strike wide spreads with either puts or calls on individual stocks.  I'm thinking to mitigate risk, the best tactic here is using names I am familiar with such as COIN, AAPL, TSLA, ETC and going short around .15 delta.  I also use the implied move (ATM straddle) as a metric to determine how far OTM to go.  I like the .15 delta but I would prefer going 2.5 to 3 times the implied move to be extra cautions.  My consensus is after looking at the data and extrapolating a little is that I can make around $1,500 a week with $25,000 per trade.  Does this seem like a viable tactic to use?  \n\nFor example next week, I am expecting the market volatility to be high so I am aware the market can go up or down a considerable amount.  With that said, I am more than confident TSLA will not break 100 and for that reason, selling the 100 strike (P) on a weekly, and buying the 99 (P) would yield around 3%.

I wouldn't mind to squeeze as much premium before I risk to get assigned.\n\nThere is nothing to guarantee that TSLA will not go below $100. On a daily chart there is a strong resistance at around $124.48 and that would be my confirmation for 2 consecutive days before I would write a put spread. I need a long confirmation to see if it would bounced back after such a long bear run. Holding such a position for 4-8 days (writing weeklies) personally I don't see it to be any good. I have no any edge and especially the IV, which I am talking about it later.\n\nThe way i see it,  there is a very close imbalance that was formed on the 6/1 and is quite rich and might see the price moving downwards at these levels ($101.81), Writing puts now is not a good time unless getting assigned (with additional rolls and squeezing premium) compared to taking a loss is your plan. And don't forget that writing puts now you actually bet against the trend. We only see a small consolidation on the 4hrs chart.\n\nDon't forget that there important economical releases on the 18th and something tells me the IV will increase. Another thing on TSLA is that the IV has already started dropping compared the 2 weeks and 1 month ago and on a daily chart the IV is contracting. I wouldn't take into consideration of the IV Percentile (82%) at the moment as a good indicator but instead I find IV Rank more important and at the moment the IV of the past 52weeks is exactly in middle at 49%.\n\nI wanted briefly to describe an approach I usually follow. In general speaking there is nothing at the moment that gives me a confirmation whether I will be bearish or bullish yet.\n\nBack to you, I usually write at .2, .3 or .4 deltas especially on red days, or I have a good confirmation that the price is 'almost' guaranteed to move towards my way", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">Back to you, I usually write at .2, .3 or .4 deltas especially on red days, or I have a good confirmation that the price is 'almost' guaranteed to move towards my way\n\nNk, I understand that there is no guarantee that TSLA will go below $100, in finance there is never a guarantee and you can always argue anything is possible.  The point behind this strategy is that going 2.5 - 3 times the expected move (ATM Straddle), you often get to deltas below 10, in this case 3.  AKA, there is roughly a 1 in 33 chance that I get exercised and loose on this spread.  I guess the real question of importance for this strategy is whether that methodology of interpreting the greek delta is a correct view.  I really like the perspective that says, if your risk on return is greater than the delta of your short leg, mathematically you have a long term winning strategy.  You don't even have to be good at TA per se to make this strategy work.  The problem is that when your ROR is greater than your delta, it typically means the ticker has a high IV rank and there for a big move is expected.  This can surely be a silver lining but also an achilles heel to a strategy.  \n\nEither way though, I am not placing the trade on TSLA until I understand more about market sentiment and TSLA earnings.  If earnings are bad and sentiment is good in the coming weeks, half the research based firms on Wall Street will upgrade it to a buy and we'll see TSLA climb back to levels more reasonable.  Either way, my thesis is not that it will go up, but that it shouldn't go far below the range we've seen around the $100-115 mark.

It works on $SPY and $QQQ, while I am sure it works on all underlyings I only looked at it on these two as these have higher priced options with multiple expiries per week.  Further, ETFs are a bit safer because they don't tend to see massive sustained movement in one direction or the other, while a stock can and will keep falling, or can and will squeeze higher for an unknown length of time.\n\nBasically, what you do is you throw the 4X Keltner Channels, set to 21 periods on your chart and the Keltner Channels set to 1X, also at 21 periods.  This gives you the average volatility of the month around the monthly mean (the 1X multiplier) and a band that encompasses 99.9% of all price data (the 4X) band.  Lastly, add the Choppiness Index to the chart.  This is an oscillator that measures whether something is trending or rangebound.  When a candle closes within the the 1X Keltner band and the Choppiness Index crosses and closes above the 50 level from below on the daily, you sell an Iron Condor for 3 weeks out. The closer the CI moves to 70 the more rangebound the stock is. Your short strikes are at the 4X band or just outside of it.
