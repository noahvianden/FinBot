{"title": "Why This May Be A 'Life Changing' Market Rally; Apple, Fed Meeting Loom As Tesla Run Hits 75%", "selftext": "Dow Jones futures will open Sunday evening, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures.\n\nThe stock market rally cleared some major resistance in the past week. The major indexes had solid gains, responding bullishly to uneven earnings reports and economic data. Leading stocks acted well, with breakouts and buy points continuing to work.\n\nSince the Jan. 6 follow-through day, the market rally has shown robust gains. In fact, the advance suggests this uptrend could be a \"moneymaker\" or even a \"life-changing\" rally, according to one noted growth investor.\n\nSo investors should be taking advantage of the opportunities. But do so carefully. The market rally is around key levels, while it's another big week for news.\n\n`Apple` (`AAPL`), Google parent `Alphabet` (`GOOGL`), `Amazon` (`AMZN`), Facebook parent Meta Platforms (`META`) are all on tap, as well as hundreds of other companies. Apple stock and these other tech titans are rebounding strongly, but have a lot of repair work. Still, their earnings and guidance will be key for the market rally as well as many other tech stocks.\n\nThe Federal Reserve holds its policy meeting this coming week, with another rate hike expected on Feb. 1. The big question is when Fed chief Jerome Powell and his colleagues call a halt to further rate increases.\n\n`Tesla` (`TSLA`) skyrocketed on mixed earnings as CEO Elon Musk was bullish about the future. TSLA stock soared from its Jan. 6 bear market low, but isn't yet offering a buy point.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla archrival BYD (`BYDDF`), Snowflake (`SNOW`), Shift4Payments (`FOUR`) and Etsy (`ETSY`) are four aggressive stocks in or near potential buy areas. But handle them with care.\n\nETSY stock is on SwingTrader. FOUR stock is on the `IBD 50`.\n\n# Dow Jones Futures Today\n\nDow Jones futures open at 6 p.m. ET on Sunday, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures.\n\nRemember that overnight action in `Dow futures` and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular  `us stock market` session.\n\n# Stock Market Rally\n\nThe stock market rally had strong gains across the board this past week.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 1.8% in last week's `stock market trading`. The S&P 500 index jumped 2.5%. The Nasdaq composite leapt 4.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 2.4%.\n\nU.S. crude oil futures fell 2.4% to $79.68 a barrel during the week, reversing from a recent high of $82.48 intraday Friday.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield rose 3 basis points to 3.52%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates by just a quarter point on Feb. 1, after a half-point move in December and four straight hikes of 75 basis points before that. Markets overwhelmingly expect another quarter-point hike in late March, to a 4.75%-5% range. But investors are now betting that policymakers will hold steady.\n\n# ETFs\n\nAmong growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (`FFTY`) advanced 2.5% last week. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (`IGV`) popped 4.5%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (`SMH`) rallied 5.2% to a five-month high.\n\nReflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (`ARKK`) soared 10.7% last week and ARK Genomics ETF (`ARKG`) jumped 5%. Tesla stock is a major holding across Ark Invest's ETFs, with Cathie Wood's Ark loading up on shares in recent months. Ark also owns a small stake in BYD.\n\nSPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (`XME`) climbed 2.1% last week to an eight-month high. The Global X U.S. Infrastructure Development ETF (`PAVE`) climbed 3.3%. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) edged up 0.3%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (`XHB`) stepped up 3.3%. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) climbed 0.8%, its seventh straight weekly gain. The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) advanced 2.55%. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (`XLV`) fell 0.8%, a fifth straight weekly decline.\n\n# Megacap Earnings\n\nMeta Platform earnings are due Wednesday night. META stock rallied for a fifth straight week, leaping 8.9% to just below its 200-day line.\n\nApple earnings are due Thursday night. It'll likely be a rough quarter, with iPhone production delays taking a toll. But AAPL stock jumped 5.85% last week, closing in on its 200-day line.\n\nGoogle earnings are also late Thursday. GOOGL stock shrugged off a new Justice Department antitrust suit to ultimately climb 1.4%. But it's still some distance from its 200-day.\n\nAmazon earnings also are slated after Thursday's closing bell. AMZN stock tested 50-day line support on Wednesday morning but roared higher for a 5.1% weekly gain. Shares are still well below their 200-day line.\n\n## Tesla Stock\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/azq1v444hqea1.png?width=1308&format=png&auto=webp&s=8dd374d2f1a8dba3c4de3498c9a809f7e6937d98\n\nTesla stock surged 33% last week, rocketing above its 50-day line. Since its Jan. 6 bear-market low of 101.84, TSLA stock has erupted for a 75% gain.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Tesla earnings slightly beat lowered analyst views, while revenue was roughly in line. But shares spiked as Elon Musk was bullish on demand following price cuts and predicted production of up to 2 million vehicles.\n\nWill revived Tesla demand be sustained? It may be several weeks before there's a clear picture. By Tuesday morning, investors should get some weekly China EV registration data for Tesla and other automakers. However, Tesla Shanghai was closed this past week for the Chinese New Year holiday, which likely also affected demand. Later in the week, investors will get January sales data from BYD, Nio (`NIO`), Li Auto (`LI`) and XPeng (`XPEV`), but not Tesla.\n\n## Market Rally Analysis\n\nThe stock market rally ticked off a lot of boxes this past week.\n\nThe major indexes tested support midweek and passed with flying colors. By Friday's close, the Nasdaq composite had rallied above its 200-day moving average and its December highs. The Russell 2000 also nudged above its late 2022 peaks intraday Friday. The S&P 500, now decisively above its 200-day line, is on the cusp of topping its December highs. The Dow Jones, now the laggard, is doing fine as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/za6ynat4iqea1.png?width=1255&format=png&auto=webp&s=e97db5452e3e2306795e1fd5486c4bc3f7b50938)\n\nThe indexes faded into Friday's close, paring daily gains. But that's after finishing near intraday highs for six straight sessions. Strong closes are a hallmark of bull markets. `stock market movers`\t\n\nThe action has come amid a barrage of earnings and guidance that was often weak or lackluster, along with mixed economic data. But it's not the news, it's the reaction to the news.\n\nMeanwhile, leading stocks continue to act well. While Tesla has skyrocketed and this column highlighted aggressive names such as Etsy and SNOW stock, this is a broad-based advance. Energy, steelmakers, housing-related groups, retailers, financials, auto parts, travel, trucking and more are showing strength sector-wide and in individual stocks.\n\nInvestors are turning more bullish in part because they see brighter, clearer prospects for the economy. China and Europe are shoring up global growth while inflation is cooling. The Fed is close to being finished raising rates.\n\nStill, earnings season remains intense. While Apple stock, Google, Amazon and Meta don't have buy points, their reports \u2014 and hundreds of others \u2014 could still roil the market. The Fed may be more hawkish than expected. Big economic reports, including Friday's January jobs report, also will be important.\n\n## A 'Life Changer' Market Rally?\n\nStill, the 2023 market rally's strong start is a very bullish signal.\n\nEric Krull, co-author of \"The Lifecycle Trade,\" `noted on Friday's IBD Live` that the Nasdaq composite had risen 8.9% from the close of the Jan. 6 follow-through day to Thursday's close. That 15-day gain is unusually high. Krull says that \"moneymaker\" rallies typically see a 5.5% gain over a similar span. For \"life changer\" rallies, the average advance is nearly 8%.\n\n## What To Do Now\n\nYou don't want life to pass you by, or life-changing rallies, so you should be taking advantage of the current market uptrend. The strong advance in the major indexes and leading stocks shows a real character change from the choppy October-December uptrend.\n\nSo work on your watchlists, looking for stocks setting up or actionable now.
