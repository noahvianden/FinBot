It's common to compare everything in your portfolio to some index like SPY but you can use whatever you want - just think of making everything apples to apples, where the apple is the beta weighting \"anchor\" that you pick. \n\nNow once you've picked your beta weighting anchor, you can look across your portfolio and see what your beta weighted delta number is. If you are bearish you can use various strategies to get a portfolio wide negative value - my favorite is vertical call credit spreads on SPX. If you're bullish then I like going long on stocks instead of options. However you do it though, this final resulting delta number is essentially the same as being long or short on whatever beta weighted anchor you're using. \n\nSo to summarize by example: if I look at my IRA right now, I've got a beta weighted delta of +25, which is \\~10k worth of long SPY (@ 382) even though my account holdings are much larger, this is just my risk level if the market moves down further.
