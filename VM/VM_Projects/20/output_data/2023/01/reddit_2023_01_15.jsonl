{"title": "Am I understanding credit spreads correctly? Here's an example of a put credit spread.", "selftext": "Please bear with me here as I am new to this and still learning how to employ strategies. For now, I am paper trading because I know significant risk comes with options. I would like someone to help me review this for my own understanding.\n\nI've been studying and credit spreads seem to be a a decent way to have a high probability of return while capping losses. Here's an example I cooked up using [optionsprofitcalculator](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/):\n\nStrategy: Put Spread. I am bullish on the underlying and do not expect it to drop, so I am going to write and sell short puts and hedge myself with a long put in case the underlying does drop.\n\nSymbol: AMD - Current Price: $71.1\n\nPut Spread: [https://imgur.com/a/2GIQPvu](https://imgur.com/a/2GIQPvu).\n\nChart: [https://imgur.com/a/YiFS7St](https://imgur.com/a/YiFS7St).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's some statistics on the trade:\n\n* Entry Credit: $29.00 net credit\n* Maximum Risk: $71.00\n* Maximum return: $29.00 (at AMD$67.00)\n* Max return on risk: 40.8% (745% ann.)\n* Probability of profit: 70.5%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith 0% IV change (unlikely), it seems theta is on our side here. As long as the underlying doesn't drop by 5.77% at expiry, we stand to make the full $29.00. While this doesn't sound like much - what if I bought multiple contracts? I have $1430 in capital, which allows me to sustain a max loss of roughly 20 contracts. This means I have a 70.5% chance to gain $580 (at max).\n\nIs what I said even correct? If so, why aren't more people doing this? This is a significant increase in potential profit compared to normal investing. If I really have a 70.5% chance to gain $580 in 21 days, that's insane. It's still gambling, but it's reasonable gambling if you ask me.\n\nBonus question if anyone feels like it: what happens if I buy the maximum number of contracts I can for this (20.x at $1430) and someone chooses to exercise one of these? I am writing contracts for shares I do not own. Obviously, this is not enough to cover the shares for even one contract.

AMD touches your $67 strike and you are risking your whole position if it continues to drop. So do you roll? If you do and AMD stays around $65 you can no longer roll. You've already collected around 0.44 credit per spread.

{"title": "Questions about rolling strats", "selftext": "I started trading options like a year ago and lost a lot of money in situations where I now think rolling would have protected me at least partially. Now, I've been selling puts 1-2 weeks out on TSLA and I'm trying to incorporate rolling into my strategy in a way to protect myself but also potentially increase my returns.\n\n Let's say tsla is trading around 120 (it is right now). My strat recently has been something like, selling puts at a 105 strike for a week out. If tsla trades at around 120 and the option approaches expiration, i roll up the option to a higher strike but for the same expiration date. I keep a low delta, but i make some more money at a point where I've already gotten most of the value from my original option. \n\nAlong with this, the other aspect of my strat is that if there's a negative shock to the stock price (Tesla has experienced several of these recently then bounced back up) i role my option out to the next Friday while keep the strike the same (potentially lowering slightly based on how I'm feeling). My thought here is basically, since the further out strike has a higher Delta, the drop in price affects it to a greater degree than for my nearer dated option (which sometime doesn't even really increase in price because the Delta is so low and it's pretty near expiration). So basically i roll out on shocks to the stock price, although I'm not necessarily rolling down.\n\nAlso lastly I've never been letting options expire, i always roll so i can benefit from theta burn over the weekend. The only issue is that even though I know theta is supposed to still work on non trading days, i feel like i don't really see it's impact Monday morning.\n\nSo my question is basically, is my method of incorporating rolling smart? I feel like in a way these short dates options are actually safer than selling longer dated ones because i can take advantage of the higher deltas of further out options to roll down more easily if their is a big decline in stock price. I also think that I'm making much higher returns than when I was only sticking to selling 30-45 day CSPs.\n\nDefinitely welcome any feedback so if what I'm doing is really dumb please tell me.", "id": "10cm1x0", "created_utc": 1673795301.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Why are people in this thread even speculating if theta works over the weekend or not?
