{"title": "Starbucks workers at over 150 stores to go on strike over Pride d\u00e9cor dispute", "selftext": " More than 3,000 workers at over 150 Starbucks (SBUX.O) stores in the United States will walk off the job over the next week, the union representing the coffee chain's baristas said on Friday, following claims the company had banned Pride Month decorations at some of its cafes.\n\nThe strikes are also aimed at pushing the company to reach fair labor contracts for improved pay and benefits, the Starbucks Workers United union added. The company is yet to reach any collective bargaining agreements at its newly unionized cafes.\n\nShares of Starbucks, which runs about 9,000 U.S. company-owned locations, fell more than 2.5% in broadly lower markets.\n\nThe strike comes ahead of a big weekend for U.S. Pride Month celebrations, with Pride Parades set to take place on Sunday in several major cities including New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Chicago.\n\nThe union claims that managers at dozens of Starbucks locations had prevented employees from putting up Pride Month flags and decorations, or had removed them.\n\nStarbucks on Friday called the claims \"false information\". It said last week there had been \"no change to any policy on this matter\" and it was still encouraging store managers to celebrate Pride Month as long as store safety guidelines were followed.\n\nSeveral U.S. retail brands have faced backlash from conservatives over the display of LGBTQ+ merchandise, as well as criticism from gay rights groups for insufficient support for the community after the companies relented under pressure from conservatives.\n\nU.S. retailer Target (TGT.N) was forced to pull some Pride merchandise off shelves after confrontations between some shoppers and store workers, while Anheuser-Busch InBev's (ABI.BR) efforts to market to the transgender community have led to a steep drop in sales of its Bud Light beer in recent weeks.\n\nShareholders are taking note. Earlier in June, New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who manages the state's public pension funds, wrote to Starbucks, Target and more than 50 other companies in which the funds are invested.\n\nDiNapoli asked them to explain how they were managing corporate risks from recent attacks on LGBTQ+ equality, including their approach to state legislation that could hurt recruitment, and how they were supporting LGBTQ+ employees.\n\nStarbucks was the first company to reply to DiNapoli. On June 14, it reiterated its inclusive policies, showing a timeline that goes back to 1988, when it began offering full health benefits to same-sex domestic partners, according to letters seen.\n\nStarbucks also faces hundreds of complaints at the National Labor Relations Board, over its alleged illegal practices such as firing union supporters and shutting stores during labor campaigns. Workers at more than 300 U.S. stores have voted to unionize since late 2021.\n\nStarbucks Workers United said on Friday the company's flagship Seattle Roastery was kicking off the nationwide strike, dubbed \"Strike with Pride\".", "id": "14hld6t", "created_utc": 1687587831.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "I get very confused on why people feel it\u2019s so necessary to celebrate who they sleep with so passionately at work.

{"title": "\"Is the AI-led 'F*cking Baby Bubble' Bursting? BofA Says Tech Stocks Just Saw Their Biggest Outflow in 10 Weeks.\"", "selftext": "The current AI-led \"baby bubble\" could be seen as a positive or a negative depending on the perspective. On the one hand, it is a sign of progress and innovation, with technology giants such as Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Tesla leading the way. The stock prices of these companies have boomed this year, suggesting that investors are bullish on the future of AI.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some who are warning that the investor hype for AI could be short-lived and that the market could be heading for a significant correction. Bank of America's Michael Hartnett has compared the current AI boom to the dot-com bubble of the early 2000s, where the Nasdaq Composite plummeted 78%. UBS's Art Cashin and veteran economist David Rosenberg have also drawn parallels with the dot-com bubble.\n\nUltimately, it is difficult to know for sure whether the AI-led \"baby bubble\" will burst or if it will continue to grow and drive the stock market higher. It is important to remember that, while AI has the potential to revolutionize many industries, it is still a relatively new technology and there is a lot of uncertainty and risk associated with investing in AI-related stocks. As such, it is important for investors to do their due diligence and be aware of the potential downsides before investing in AI stocks.\n\n(https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-led-baby-bubble-bursting-020103566.html)\n\nWhat lessons can be learned from the dot-com bubble that could be applied to the current AI stock boom?", "id": "14hhtr6", "created_utc": 1687576263.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "A difference between this bubble and the dot com bubble is money isn't flooding into companies that will be going under in a few years.

{"title": "Options strategy I have been thinking about this week (need advice/opinions)", "selftext": "I am looking at getting some feedback/advice on an options strategy that I have been thinking about a the past week or so.  I am relatively new to this, but have been doing a lot of reading and learning to get myself up to speed.  This may already have a name, but I haven\u2019t been able to find what it would be called.  It\u2019s something like a layered covered straddle/strangle (depending if you wanna pivot off of the ITM price or not).  I\u2019m gonna use fake numbers and stocks to explain how it works to keep myself from getting confused.  Okay, so here\u2019s the strategy: &nbsp;\n\nWe want to make money off of a stock \u2013 Deez Nuts ($DZNT), which is currently valued at $200.  We currently have $160,000 (exactly 800 shares worth).  Rather than just selling puts to try to get in at a lower price, we spend half of our money ($80,000) buying 400 shares. &nbsp;\n\nWe sell 4 covered call contracts at the following strike prices: &nbsp;\n\n$205\n\n$210\n\n$215\n\n$220&nbsp;\n\nSo, if the stock ever rises, we will have our shares bought 100 at a time, where our $205 call will yield the best premium, but will be more likely to get exercised than the $220 call.  This sort of hedges us against rapid swings by benefiting from both the higher premiums of the lower calls and higher price differential for the higher calls in the possibility of a fast rise or fall.  We have exactly enough shares to cover all of our contracts in case we get called on all of them. &nbsp;\n\nNext, we sell 4 cash-secured put contracts at the following strike prices: &nbsp;\n\n$195\n\n$190\n\n$185\n\n$180&nbsp;\n\nSame situation as above, where if all four of our contracts are exercised, we have enough money laying around to buy the shares as needed.  Similarly, having our contracts layered like so gives us wiggle room in case the stock drops by a considerable amount while still benefitting from higher premiums near the strike price and better dollar cost averaging as we go further down from the strike price. &nbsp;\n\nSo, even if the stock rapidly jumps up AND down, we both have enough stocks and enough money to cover all of our options.  Now, let\u2019s say that $DZNT drops to $187 and we get assigned; we now have to buy 200 more shares of $DZNT, putting us to a total of 600 shares.  Instead of having 4 calls and 4 puts like before, we currently have 4 calls and 2 puts active.  So, let\u2019s take our extra shares and sell 2 more calls so that we have 6 calls and 2 puts. &nbsp;\n\nWe can sell the two calls at a strike price of: &nbsp;\n\n$200\n\n$195&nbsp;\n\nAgain, no matter how the stock moves, we still have plenty of money to pay for assignment and enough stocks to cover being called.  Effectively, we sort of \u201cnudge\u201d it to go in a specific direction and benefit from having a large number of options always active.  Because we have several contracts that are at a high likelihood of being exercised (being near the strike price and all), we are able to sell more contracts throughout the week, swinging back and forth against the direction of the market. &nbsp;\n\nThe other option I considered was instead of having a 6/2 split in the above case, buy-to-close the two calls that are further OTM and keep a 4/4 split pivoting about the new ITM price of $187 ($185?). &nbsp;\n\nDownsides:\n\n1.  Similar to the wheel strategy, this requires a large upfront amount of capital to perform\n\n2.  If $DZNT moons, we miss out on the massive gains\n\n3.  If $DZNT tanks, we bought shares at an over-inflated price\n\n4.  Because of the higher frequency of contracts being exercised, this is less passive than the wheel strategy and requires being at the computer and active for more of the week\n\n5.  Does not work well on stocks that are prone to have massive sudden swings or low volume\n(please provide more if I am missing something) &nbsp;\n\nUpsides:\n\n1.  Lots of income from premiums\n\n2.  Benefit from kangaroo markets or volatile stocks that swing a lot in a consistent band by buying low and selling high more often\n\n3.  More capital efficient than the wheel strategy (I believe)\n\n4.  Gives me something to do during the day and make me feel smart\n\n5.  Provides safety when markets are very swingy (like right now) and a consistent income so that I don\u2019t have to go to work anymore. &nbsp;\n\nAny feedback would be great, as I want to learn as much as I can before I actually start trading options.  I plan to dip my toes in and start much smaller than this at first just so I can get a feel for things.  I\u2019m considering doing this with $TQQQ, $TSLA (risky?), $NVDA (also risky?), $MSFT, $APPL, or whatever else is suggested that would work well.  I believe something between $150 and $500 would be ideal.  I have just over $100,000 of cash in my brokerage and I would also like to use margin to double up on that.  I estimate this could yield somewhere around $1000 to $1500 per week when times are not rill bad, which is more than enough for me to quit working.  So, yeah, please tell me if this is a viable strategy :) &nbsp;", "id": "14i2bgq", "created_utc": 1687637378.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "No offense but admitting you are new and trying to propose new complex strategies is an oxymoron.\n\nBesides this strategy is basically a low yielding wheel.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly.
