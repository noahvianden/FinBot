{"title": "Tesla 2Q discussion", "selftext": "As everyone on this sub knows - Tesla will be releasing the 2Q delivery numbers this weekend - seems that the street is looking for 445,000 as a high and 430,000 as a low.  I think with all the incentives this past quarter and all of the push to sell cars (aggressively) that Tesla will surprise and come in with 470,000 deliveries. \n\nLet me state facts:\n\n1) I made the jump and leased a 2023 model S in early May because the 3 year unlimited free charging was appealing\u2026The price point at around 89k was attractive compared to the Porsche Taycan over 120k and Lucid Air over 100k.  \n\nAlso the entry level 3 and Y have the full $7500 tax credit and are extremely affordable - also 3 month unlimited charging.  \n\n2) The tremendous amount of superchargers in the network helped alleviate the fear of \u201cnot finding a power source\u201d.  Put a novice mind at ease knowing there is a Tesla supercharger everywhere and not driving aimlessly looking for one.  \n\n3) I walked into a Tesla showroom at a mall in Scottsdale, AZ and the place was packed ( early June ). Furthermore, the employees (salespeople) were aggressively asking me questions and seemed incentivized to make sales.  Although they don\u2019t get individual commissions they have a point structure / reward system established to tally and bonus salespeople that sell cars.  Given I had an S already I inquired about an X for my wife - the sales person called me 2 times and texted me 3 times to follow up and see if I was ready to order.  This was unlike any previous Tesla showroom experience I had in the past where uninterested snowflakes just stood around looking bored or bothered if you dared ask questions.  \n\nThesis : Tesla and the employees are motived to move cars and push the company forward.  Given macro events ( war, inflation, stagnant global growth) I believe Tesla has incredible name brand recognition and the \u201cit factor\u201d.  I think they beat the street number by a wide margin and the stock gaps up Monday morning.  \n\nAll Just my opinion not financial advice.", "id": "14mo0db", "created_utc": 1688092526.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "\"FUD Filters | We need standards to crack down on spam.\n    If you have any suggestions, please reply here, and we can make sure others can view/agree/disagree and we do this right, together.\n\n  Creating post saying you sold shares\n  - If you're creating a post stating you sold shares at a loss, a screenshot of your sold position will be required, else it will be removed as spam.\n\n  Creating a post regarding a tweet\n  - If you're creating a post regarding a tweet, the original TWTR url must be linked on the post as well, else it will be removed as spam.\n  - Flair used must be TWTR\n\n  Creating a self-harm post\n  Creating a Poop Post or Low Effort Post\n  - Yes, these will automatically be removed.\"\n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
