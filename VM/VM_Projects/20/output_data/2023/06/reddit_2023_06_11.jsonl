You also need to look at the vol skew to understand if the strikes you want to sell are cheap or expensive relative to other strikes.\n\n>But you're trying to make a profit, not a probability of profit.\n\nSo if you're *trying* to make a profit, wouldn't you prefer a higher probability of profit, which gives you *a higher probability* of making said profit? Obviously, there are tradeoffs. The further you go OTM, the higher the PoP but the profit potential decreases significantly more than the buying power requirements - there's no free lunch. So you have to weigh the risk against the PoP against the return on capital to figure out what's the \"sweet spot\".\n\n>That might be a reason -- but OP's real problem is making any profit at all.\n\nWith SPAN margin and portfolio margin, making profits by selling way OTM options is very doable.

Good reminders that the fight against inflation is not over. \n\n\u2022\tMeanwhile back in the US, the Fed had gone silent this week before the FOMC meeting next week. The market has largely priced in a pause in June. Given the goldilocks economic data in the past month, it is unlikely for the Fed to surprise the market with either more hawkish or dovish languages at the meeting.\n\n\u2022\tOn the other hand, China and Japan are continuing their loose credit policies as these countries worry more about deflation rather than inflation.\n\n\u2022\tAs for liquidity, we know TGA will be refilled, and we know the Fed is on track with QT, and both are bad for the market, so RRP is the most important thing to watch here. RRP declined this week, but in small amounts. TGA increase is also small so the total liquidity proxy mostly decreased due to Fed QT. A small divergence appeared between liquidity and S&P 500 performance.

Accumulated savings: Households have saved approximately $2.1 trillion between March 2020 and August 2021, but around $900 billion remains. High-income households may hold a significant portion of these savings, potentially impacting spending patterns.\n2. Pent-up demand for services: Spending on services has increased, driven by pent-up demand and a desire to make up for lost time. However, as this demand is satisfied, consumption growth may slow. Some retailers have observed weakness in discretionary categories, suggesting a potential consumer pullback.\n3. Tight labor markets: Labor shortages persist due to early retirements and reduced immigration during the pandemic. While overall employment has increased, certain sectors like leisure and hospitality have not fully recovered lost jobs. Job openings exceed the number of unemployed, but there are early signs of normalization, with job quit rates, hours worked, and wage growth starting to decrease while jobless claims rise.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/674pp0q6de5b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca35935bf647aab2c25bb447c3c58b83743d5ade\n\nOther economic data\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8ijbcwg8de5b1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=308b27b2c5646c200dd0a243ef5c2619f15fce0c\n\n**US business and markets: Another round of style and sector rotation is likely happening.**\n\n\u2022\tS&P 500 meets technical definition of a new bull market, closing above 20% its October low.

My year-end SP500 target is between 3920 to 4410 based on 16-18X forward PE ratio. Many banks have raised their year-end target recently. Investor sentiment certainly support a higher PE multiple for now. However, given a lot of headwinds ahead especially short term liquidity drain, possibility of more Fed hikes, and further economic slowdown, I am being a little cautious and not changing my target just yet.\n\nLight blue box is where we are today.
