The unemployment rate is a very shallow yes or no question essentially.  Are you employed yes or no.\n\nHere are the things to look for.\n\n-Labor productivity, fell in Q1 and is expected to fall in Q2.  This typically means companies are over staffed and each independent employee does less productive work per hour because there are so many other people to pick up the slack.  Obviously this does not represent every industry or region as some specific areas are understaffed perennially.  (Health care, teachers, law enforcement, fire etc.)\n\n-Falling average weekly hours.  To compensate for point number 1 above, and companies afraid to lay people off yet, they cut hours.  This has been happening since early 2021 when inflation started to creep into expenses.  We are at 34.3 hours average as of May.\n\n-Increase in initial jobless claims for unemployment.  This has been trending up since Sept of 2021 slowly but has picked up steam in Q2 of 2023.\n\n-Even unemployment itself ticked up from 3.4% to 3.7% last month and is projected to increase after June\u2019s data.\n\nThe problem is, when labor markets go from healthy to unhealthy it happens very very fast.  So we are seeing the signs of fracture.  Does that mean it will break loose?  No.  But the data isn\u2019t fake, people just aren\u2019t looking hard enough at underlying data.\n\nWe are a lazy society that has no patience.  All of the signs of recession are happening and we are still on the early side of the bell curve in terms of timing from initial indicators to recession.  When people don\u2019t get immediate confirmation of something they expect in this era, they immediately demonize analysts and people much smarter than them for the event not occurring.\n\nEvery months data gets worse, the chance of recession is 100%, for the people who don\u2019t believe that, you are under informed.\n\nThe question is, how bad will the recession be?  How long will it last?  Will it hit many industries at once or will it roll through industries in waves over many years?  How bad will the unemployment get?  How many corporations will go bankrupt?  Etc.  \n\nUnemployment is usually the caboose to the train, that and interest rate cuts.  So when those happen we are already in the middle of the shit.

And there's barely an effect starting to take place in terms of the job market. With that in mind once those jobless claims start hitting 300k, 400k, 500k a week it's far far too late to slam on the brakes and stop it.
