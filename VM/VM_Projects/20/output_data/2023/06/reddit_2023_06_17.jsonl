Arguably ATI/AMD had better hardware in some generations since they tended to leapfrog each other. While ATI/AMD was fairly competitive in the consumer market, the professional market was dominated by Nvidia. Unlike gaming cards, professional cards sales are very sticky. The reason is simple, if you switch from Nvidia to AMD and run into driver bugs, you\u2019ll bitch about it, but you will still likely defend your decision on Reddit. If you\u2019re the decision maker who switched from Nvidia to AMD and your company lost productivity, you career will be affected in a negative way.\n\nAs a developer, I\u2019m happy to play with ROCm to see how it works and even buy an AMD card to use at home. But no way in hell will I recommend my company switch to AMD unless everyone else has switched.\n\nThere are AI chip startups that are building technically promising products, but I don\u2019t think they can compete in the same space as Nvidia. They will be bought by Nvidia if they are successful. Library and compiler developers are paid to work primarily on their employer\u2019s technologies. Nvidia developers work on CUDA ecosystem and Google engineers work on XLA, etc. Data scientists and model builders couldn\u2019t care less about the underlying technology as long as they don\u2019t have to spend a lot of time debugging framework issues. Right now Nvidia and Google have the most engineers working on libraries and compilers. So Nvidia or Google solutions are most supported and wildly used (I counted Meta and Microsoft in the Nvidia camp). Although it is like 90% Nvidia, 9.5% Google, and 0.5% others. The barrier of entry is extremely high for upstart chips companies to migrate existing models and libraries to their new chips and gain wild adaptions. Google can do it because they\u2019re Google, they don\u2019t have VCs breathing down their necks, and they have enough internal demands to sustain development for a long time. \n\nAmazon and Google build their own network switches because off the shelf ones cannot meet their demand. Network switches are relatively simple compared to TPUs, GPUs and CPUs, and it doesn\u2019t cost billions a year to keep up with with the latest advancements. Cloud service providers are not in the business to sell their own hardware. If someone can provide them with hardware that they can rent out for higher profit margin, that\u2019s what they will do. That\u2019s why GCP is the largest purchaser of Nvidia GPUs although Google has every incentive to push for more TPU use. \n\nAll Nvidia needs is a few years of \u201cmoat\u201d to keep competition from gaining momentum and they will run away with the biggest hardware cash cow in history.
