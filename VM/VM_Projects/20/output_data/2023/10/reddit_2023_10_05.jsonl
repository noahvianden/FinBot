{"title": "Continued Bull-Run?", "selftext": "This is the case for a bull run as I believe we will be getting a strong bounce up and it has to do with these two charts I\u2019m showing here.\n\nChart 1\u2014 SPY: This is very interesting Cup and handle forming here since the last high got put in Nov 2021. The handle portion is typically retraced no more than 1/2 of the low point of the cup. In this case, the halfway point here would be 410 on SPY.\n\nNow, we peaked again at the end of July 23. A lot of recent sentiment and economic news leans bearish. So what if it\u2019s a market correction? Typically, a correction is a 10% drop in the price and is considered a healthy pullback to continue up. A 10% drop is roughly $413.\n\nNow, look at the fibonacci levels from the prior 52 weeks. The 0.618 level is almost exactly $410. If you also use mean reversion, theres a big support level there at the $410 level. Very indicative of a capitulation occurring.\n\nThe handle channel on the chart also shows the top line of the green trend to be mid $430\u2019s. $440 also wouldnt be out of reach cause of a gap close. This is where I suspect it will bounce back down to the $410 level and launch back up to continue bullish trend.\n\nFrom this chart, a 10% correction would end around November 15th and begin to rise up and break the downward trend. But with a suspected bounce happening this month, we may break the trend and continue to new highs earlier than anticipated.\n\nChart 2\u2014DXY\n\nThe dollar index has been on a rampage, along with bonds and oil, driving the markets down with it. Today, utilities were down, bonds were down, DXY was down, and VIX was down, letting the market breathe in the process.

{"title": "McDonald (MCD) DCF Analysis", "selftext": "**NOTE ALL PERSONAL OPINION, NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE**  \n\n\n# INTRODUCTION:\n\n  \nMCD's golden arches are famous worldwide, it's precisely this strong goodwill that allows their business to remain attractive to franchisees for so long. The consistent quality of each MCD store regardless of where it is on earth, the large cost advantage due to how large the franchise has become and Quality of franchisee give MCD strong cash flows. However, MCD might be overly hyped by investors who assumes that the firm can just keep opening stores regardless of the macro environment which is not true.  \n**INVESTMENT THESIS 1:**  \n*Strong Quality Control (QC)*  \nMCD has a strong QC that many other fast food brands are unable to replicate. From the ingredients that they receive from suppliers (Fries, Cooking Oil, Nuggets etc.) to the training procedure (Timing to cook, how to maintain freshness, stringent training etc.) ([SOURCE](https://www.franchisedirect.com/information/markettrendsfactsaboutfranchising/thesuccessofmcdonalds/8/1111/#:~:text=Consistency%2C%20of%20course%2C%20is%20vital,decision%20on%20where%20to%20eat)). MCD has consistently produced quality products to its customers, this consistent quality is something customers are used to throughout their time with MCD allowing MCD to build strong brand goodwill. Furthermore, for other fast food chains to start their QC process now, it will be an uphill battle as there needs to be an overseer on what quality should be the standard and how they should go about fixing the quality. Strong QC also means that the experience in every MCD regardless of location will be consistent, allowing every MCD across the world to tap into MCD\u2019s strong global goodwill.  \nMCD has a Performance and Customer Excellence program, also known as PACE. PACE is a program by MCD to help consult poorly run franchises ensuring that standards are met.  \n**INVESTMENT THESIS 2:**  \n*Cost Advantage*  \nThere are 40,000 MCD stores globally compared to 50,000+ YUM Brand stores (KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell). Although YUM Brand has a higher store count, most of these brands use conflicting ingredients e.g. KFC uses buns for burgers whereas Pizza Hut doesn't use buns. So the actual economy of scale enjoyed by MCD is higher compared to other fast foods.  \nTo illustrate, as of FY22 MCD\u2019s Franchise Expense as a %Revenue is 10.1% only as compared to YUM\u2019s 26.2%  \n**INVESTMENT THESIS 3:**  \n*Franchisee Requirement*  \nMCD is a big enough brand to be stringent in their franchisee selection, high initial investment ([SOURCE](https://www.franchisedirect.com/information/howmuchdoesitcosttoopenafastfoodfranchiseintheunitedstates/)) and large time commitment through Mcdonald University. Meaning only high quality franchisees get to run MCD. In fact, MCD is one of the most popular franchise restaurants ([SOURCE](https://americasbestfranchises.com/blog/the-biggest-franchises-in-the-world-in-2023/#:~:text=McDonald's,That%20trend%20continues%20in%202023)). So with higher quality franchisees means that they will carry the MCD brand to a greater height having more commitment/experience, deeper pockets to sustain through down periods and dedication to innovate.  \nZero Territorial Franchising \u2013 Unlike nearly all franchisers during the 1950-60\u2019s and even today, McDonald\u2019s does not grant regional licenses to a single franchisee\u2026Burger King under Pillsbury, for example, was forced to acquire Diversifoods in 1985 to gain complete control over its largest franchisee as a means to improve quality. Conversely, McDonald's only allows additional stores per franchisee once baseline requirements have been met on a store-by-store basis.  \n**REVENUE:**  \nWhen forecasting Stores,  \nthe rationale I took was from \u201cWe want to continue to drive strong top line momentum so that we have that momentum through these pressures and then, of course, out of the pressures and begin to kind of recover margins and gain leverage as we go forward.\u201d - 2022 Q4 Earnings Conference.  \nManagement has given guidance in their 2022 Q4 Earnings conference that they expect to net add 1500 stores in 2023. However, this number was taken before the war in Ukraine had fully begun. So, I\u2019d assume that management only meets about 33% of their goal.  \nGoing forward, I\u2019d assume that management grows at an elevated amount due to all the marketing spend they made on their Accelerating the Arches programme for the next 3 years while inflation stabilizes. Beyond that, I\u2019ll assume that management focuses on monetizing these stores.  \nWhen forecasting Revenue/Store,  \nI\u2019m cautious in increasing the revenue/store to a significant extent. MCD is a fast food restaurant where their value proposition comes from being able to purchase a meal at affordable prices. The quantity sold could arguably be higher due to \u201cshrinkflation\u201d that pushes consumers to buy a higher quantity of food in order to be satisfied. Management constantly talks about how they take pride in being the most value for money meal amongst their competitors. But, MCD has to keep somewhat in line with inflation to protect margins. In the first 3 years of Accelerating the Arches programme, I\u2019d assume that Revenue/Store grows at a steady rate but overtime when inflation abates management slows price growth to continue their belief in providing value for money.  \n**COST:**  \nDue to tension in Europe, MCD has to provide relief to their European franchisee.  \nMCD has stated that they are looking towards using data to optimize their restaurants and push out areas of inefficiency in the operations. As seen from 2022 Q4 and 2023 Q2 Earnings Conference. \u201cWith about 90% of our business currently coming through digital channels in that market, it was remarkable to see how the market has forged digital relationships with customers. China is also making tremendous progress in running the restaurants more efficiently, all with the use of data and technology.\u201d - 2023 Q2 Earnings Conference.  \nWhen forecasting COGS,  \nthe main cost in this category comes from stores which are owned by MCD corporation themselves. From FY21 to FY22 due to the number of MCD owned stores declining they are less affected by inflation so there is a fall in COGS. So, seeing that MCD wants to maintain 95% franchised we can assume that cost cutting comes from economies of scale or better data usage allowing MCD restaurants to be better optimized.  \nWhen forecasting SG&A,  \nas the cost of labor is elevated due to the tight labor market I\u2019d assume that it takes 3 years before SG&A regresses back down to pre covid levels.  \n**CapEX and D&A:**  \nWhen forecasting D&A,  \nopting for less granularity I\u2019d assume it follows historical trends.  \nWhen forecasting CapEX,  \nI\u2019d assume CapEX spend remains elevated as seen in FY22 for the next 3 years before tapering down.  \n**Sanity Check:**  \nMCD has a ROIC of 21% ([SOURCE](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ROIC/MCD/ROIC%20%25/McDonald's%20Corp))  \n\\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/CXu0Wrm)\\] I'd assume that MCD ROIC increases as they invest in using more data to better optimize their restaurants.  \n**WACC:**  \n*Cost of Equity*  \nUS bond is AA+, yield spread (1M Avg) 0.66  \nUS 10Y T-Bond Yield (1M Avg) = 4.72  \nRFR = 4.06%  \n4050 = (4050 \\* 4.25%) \\* (1+16%) / (1+R) + \\[((4050 \\* 4.25%) \\* (1+16%)) \\* (1+3.82%) / (R - 3.82%)\\] / (1 + R) \\^ 2  \nR = 10.3%, ERP = 6.24%  \nBeta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MCD/)) = 0.64  \nCOE = 8.05%  \n*Cost of Debt*  \nMCD bond is BBB  \nMarginal Tax Rate = 21%  \nBBB bond yield ([SOURCE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLC0A4CBBBEY)) = 6.29%  \nAT Bond Yield = 4.97%  \n*Weightage*  \nMarket Price (5D Avg) = $261  \nShares O/S = 731M  \nMarket Value of Equity = 190791M  \n\\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/UthtIGf)\\]  \nWeighted average life of 8 Years, FY22 rent expense = 1476.1M  \nMV Lease Liability = 18232M  \nAs MCD does not break down the debt obligation, I took BV debt.  \nBV debt = 35904M  \nTotal Liability = 54136M  \n%Debt = 22.1%  \n%Equity = 77.9%  \nWACC = 7.37%  \n**OTHERS:**  \n*Net Operating Loss*  \nGiven that MCD does not explicitly break down their NOLs stating \u201cthe Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $407.5 million, of which $174.6 million has an indefinite carryforward. The remainder will expire at various dates from 2023 to 2040.\u201d To be conservative, I\u2019ll only consider 174.6M of NOLs.  \n*Stock Options*  \nIn 2022, MCD has 11.4M shares of options contract at Weighted Average Strike Price of $172.27 which is In-The-Money(ITM).  \nSo using the treasury stock method,  \nTotal Cash from options = 1963.88M  \nAverage Stock Price (5D Avg) = $261  \nShares able to buy back = 7.5M  \nNet Addition = 3.9M Shares.  \n**CONCLUSION:**  \nUltimately, I value MCD at $191.82 per share. I believe that MCD is overly hyped by investors who are way too optimistic about MCD's store count going up at ever increasing rates. This is unrealistic given current macro environment making any new store opening at Europe returning significantly less than average returns. The property crisis in China eroding confidence of franchisees and the strong Asian competitors e.g. Jollibee who caters more to local taste buds. I do not believe that MCD can continue strong growth for as long as investor's expect. However, given the business model of MCD, slowing growth could mean a death sentence as margins are more or less fixed. The business model is one where the end goal is absolute profits.  \nWorst Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/kAF8Fwm)\\]  \nBase Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/k8QDeMK)\\]  \nBest Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/teHoiww)\\]  \nRevenue Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/yxT40KX)\\]  \nCost Model: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/t54h96A)\\]  \nChange in NWC Schedule: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/6n05CTv)\\]  \nLease Schedule: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/ygfEERm)\\]  \n\u201cApproximately 93% Of McDonald\u2019s restaurants worldwide are owned and operated by independent local business owners.\u201d ([SOURCE](https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/franchising-overview.html))  \n\u201cFranchised restaurants represented 95% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide at December 31, 2022. \u201d - 2022 10-K", "id": "170i6pl", "created_utc": 1696512912.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 42, "comments": [{"body": "Just from skimming it looks well thought out, but I feel like 90% of the DCF Anlalyses I see on Reddit inevitably conclude a stock is like 20% above it's intrinsic value that it never returns to", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Its because the dcfs fail to account for investor preference for quality and stability. \n\nA company like MCDs will always show up as overvalued because people will pay a premium for what it offers.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Could you elaborate more on what quality and stability and premium exactly means?\n\nIf we\u2019re talking in terms of bond rating as quality, MCD is BBB so their stocks are very volatile in fact in just 5 days their stock swung by 4.9% compared to S&P by 1.6% meaning the market risk for MCD is higher", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I mean MCDs is a \"high quality\" company.

Yeah maybe their profit margins went down from an absolutely insane 15% or whatever it was to an absolutely insane 9% (again normal car company margins for *non electric vehicles* are about 3%, and EV margins are always negative exclusing tesla).
