This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).\n    \n- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.\n\n- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.\n\n- **Expiration:** 2023-11-24.\n\n- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are \"cheaper.\" High numbers mean options are \"expensive.\"\n\n- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.\n\n- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release.
