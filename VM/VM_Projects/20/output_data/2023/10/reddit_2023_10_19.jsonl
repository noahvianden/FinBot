{"title": "Taking a look at tsla financials", "selftext": " \n\nCut me some slack here because I don't follow tesla that much. Feel free to point out anything that may be incorrect\n\nThat being said.....\n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/cHTzF6K5/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/cHTzF6K5/image.png)\n\n1. First image shows production/delivery metrics. To summarize, we broke the uptrend with this quarter on both production/delivery, however we are still up year over year\n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/8kdZT7tF/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/8kdZT7tF/image.png)\n\n2. This second image shows the YOY Revenue changes. If you pay attention to the quarters, you can also see that quarter over quarter we've declined as well.\n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/LXJBLXpp/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/LXJBLXpp/image.png)\n\n3. This image shows a table of margins both year over year and quarter over quarter. You can clearly see the yoy was in the green for a long time but in 2023, took a sizable hit from all these rate hikes and price cuts.\n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/MK5MZSCb/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/MK5MZSCb/image.png)\n\n4. This is their income statement. Highlighted are some metrics you may want to pay attention to, some of which I've covered. Notice EPS is down almost half from the prior year same quarter.\n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/14hH9ZbZ/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/14hH9ZbZ/image.png)\n\n5. The balance sheet looks pretty solid. Their cash position is growing over the quarters, their current asset to current liability ratio looks much better than the prior year, and equity has gone up (keep in mind so have shares outstanding)\n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/9MGXx6Zn/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/9MGXx6Zn/image.png)\n\n6. Free cashflow has been going down. In the second picture you can see the breakdown which is a combination of lower cash from operations and higher capital expenditures.\n\nUnfortunately we don't have the q-3 SEC filings for more details\n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/W4ZJvf0M/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/W4ZJvf0M/image.png)\n\n7. From q2 SEC filings we can see that interest rates going up are not all bad for tesla. Clearly their interest income went up 815%. You might think interest income is not a big deal, but look again. Go back to point 4 and look at the income statement. **Interest income makes up 15.76% of their net income.**\n\n[https://i.postimg.cc/V6KWpVqz/image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/V6KWpVqz/image.png)\n\n8.
