Tesla has outstanding market share relative to their next-closest competitor in North America and Europe and is holding up well against domestic production in China. In many cases, Tesla has more market share than their next three competitors combined.\n\nIt's not that Tesla's volume is sagging, it's that Tesla is almost single-handedly popularizing and democratizing electric vehicles. Every year the market share of EVs (as a percentage of total vehicle sales) increases. That's where Tesla's growth is and as that happens, the numbers suggest that Tesla will wind up bigger than GM if the trends hold.\n\nThe only problem I see is that Tesla is heading down-market where the margins are slimmer and the volume is higher. That will stress manufacturing, delivery and service infrastructures without necessarily making Tesla more profit. That and we haven't seen any leaps in range, performance or features lately. We've seen some refinements, but Tesla hasn't answered Lucid's range and charging challenge and most of the new tech has been \"coming soon\" for a very long time.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Fair. Although I take exception to the \u201cno leaps in range or performance\u201d. Tesla could easily make a longer range car (Elon has mentioned this specifically), but there\u2019s just no need. Everyone needs to stop to pee and get a snack every few hours, while road-tripping, and superchargers negate the need for crazy range within each car. And how much more performance can we get? If we accelerate any faster, we\u2019ll be going back in time (insert Huey Lewis here) \ud83e\udd23", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": ">Tesla could easily make a longer range car (Elon has mentioned this specifically), but there\u2019s just no need.\n\nI disagree. It's not necessary for long road trips, but it's huge for long day trips. I often drive 2 - 4 hours, do a meeting or other event, then drive 2 - 4 hours home. In an ICE, I can do that on one tank of gas, but in an EV, we start adding in multiple charging stops that make a long day a lot longer. I made the mistake of doing that in a 2020 Performance Model X and it was actually a pretty miserable experience. \n\nWhen you can't charge at your destination, you find yourself starting the next leg of your trip with <20% and in need of a charge, but since you're only supercharging to 80% due to charging speeds, you're going to be making another charging stop that a 100% charge might have mitigated.\n\nWhen my family needs to make that kind of trip, we take my wife's car, which sucks because there's no autopilot. When I do it in my Model S, it's not bad, but it definitely takes longer.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Tesla will boost range again when the cheaper model is out and they need to differentiate the 3 and keep people buying it.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "They need a 500-550 mile Model S and a 400-425 mile Model 3 to stay ahead.
