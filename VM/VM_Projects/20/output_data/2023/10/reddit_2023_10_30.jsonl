If I let them expire then the shares are assigned and I lose the opportunity cost of the shares plus any future growth. Assuming META trades at $300 on 11/17, this is approx. 700\\*(300-140) + 100\\*(300-135) = $128.5k loss of opportunity.\n2. If I buy to close now, that will cost me ($162.29 + 7\\*$157.30) \\* 100 = $126.3k. The original premium received of 51.6k gets subtracted for a total loss of $74.7k if I exit now. Of course in that case I still have the shares which I can sell at 296 now, or I can keep them for future growth.\n\nAre these my only primary options? I'm not super experienced in this, but am I in trouble?\n\nWhat is the strategy to get out of a deep-in-the-money covered call position, where the price of the options themselves has gone up a lot?\n\nthanks", "id": "17jh6j6", "created_utc": 1698626422.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "For the 135 you can roll to March 15 2024 and buy the 135p and still net an additional 60 in credit.
