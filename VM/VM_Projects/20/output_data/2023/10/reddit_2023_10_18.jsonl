I think Disney has definitely made quite a few mistakes since COVID - firstly their script writing has gone downhill and they have over-emphasised on 'woke' content which hopefully they will be dialling back on. Secondly I think it was a mistake to launch Disney+ at all - they would've got a high level of income from licensing their content to third parties such as Netflix which is what they used to do with some Marvel content. This way they wouldn't have had the operational burden and cost of running Disney+ in addition to all the programming costs. I think Disney also made a mistake buying 21st Century Fox in 2019 - they paid way too much for it and there hasn't really been any meaningful return from that investment apart from Avatar 2 which was profitable but even if you assume that Disney made $1 billion profit from that that's still a low rate of return from $70+ billion they paid to acquire 21st Century Fox. Pretty much everything else released from 21st Century Fox hasn't made much money or has come in at a loss. So Iger did definitely make a mistake there.\n\nHowever, with that all being said I do think people still love to watch Disney content and that includes Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar and Disney branded content. I think Marvel still has the potential to be a big money generator and Star Wars script writing needs to be improved so that can be one too. I see Disney stock reaching $100 by mid 2024 assuming Disney+ doesn't lose too many subscribers, 'The Marvels' film is profitable, theme parks have average historical attendance and Disney reinstates a small dividend. Currently down on this stock at the moment but I am not selling and still have (some) confidence in a turnaround happening. However don't assume Disney will be a 'growth' stock - it is largely a value play now with the growth being minimal in the future. Let's not also forget that Disney also has a high revenue generating licensing division i.e LEGO Disney sets which generates significant income. ESPN gambling will be under their licensing division and will not be directly owned or operated by ESPN/Disney but rather PENN are just using the ESPN brand in exchange for paying a fee to Disney which I believe is around $150 million a year for 10 years.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting.
