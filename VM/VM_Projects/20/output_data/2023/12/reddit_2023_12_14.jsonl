Since my first post, the market cap has been reduced by over $100,000,000.00. It's right around 1/2 a billion now. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Current  market cap of Fisker... A paltry 504 million.](https://preview.redd.it/ocepfi39a66c1.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=28f313eda2d366c691c325cc63ec4181649f5346)\n\nThis despite the fact that you can literally order, pay for, and take delivery of an actual functioning automobile. Not in the future, but, like, right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This automobile has already been manufactured. It is functional and for less than seventy grand you can make it yours, but only if you want to explain to people five years from now why you own a car that was build by a megalomaniac that cucked you into overpaying for an EV that doesn't work right.

Why is Fisker in it and what does it have to do with my options that expire on Friday?\n\nThe 'Penalty Box' is a special place in the stock market reserved for naughty companies that do naughty shit. Things like fucking up their financials and then cycling through two CFO's in a month. This gives the street good reason to suspect that things are not well - at a financial level and (more importantly) at an organizational level. Critics of Fisker will say that putting a designer in the CEO seat is like putting a lunatic in charge of the asylum. And they're not wrong. Fisker is almost certainly a victim of the Peter Principle, which states that someone who is talented at their job will eventually get promoted up to the level where they are incompetent and then they will remain there for the duration of their career. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I'm gonna need you to come in on Saturday. ](https://preview.redd.it/cqs9c511c66c1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=1175f4cd773bd1bb806a5faa6264d037a6a08b43)\n\nHe can design a hell of a front fascia, but can he oversee the steady improvement of shareholder value? HA HA HA you fucking idiot HA HA HA those are disparate skill sets.\n\nOkay. Lets do some chart analysis. Has Fisker really been going over a cliff, like Thelma and Louise?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Is it really like this? Or is there another explanation?](https://preview.redd.it/ft9pf513d66c1.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=48dec7f5f514f3b82e1acba9d38177977530e10d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Some advanced chart analysis shows that the downward trend since early October was intercepted by the fibonacci arc with a fulcrum located right around Jan 1 2024. Also notice that volume has increased since earnings. This is what institutional investors refer to as the 'accumulation' period.

Since my last post, it looks like the smart money has been in shorting the stock into oblivion. Every share sold short is not only a bet that the stock goes to zero, but it lowers the share price just a little bit, making it harder for the company to float shares into the market and accumulate the capital it needs to survive.\n\nToday, however, something changed. It looks like companies that rely on cheap capital to survive may  have been thrown a lifeline by none other than our favorite money printer... JPOW.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Why did markets get a boner today? Because everyone likes cheap money. But ya know who REALLY likes cheap money? Companies that need to borrow in order to survive.](https://preview.redd.it/21zmx3sjf66c1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=38d3a39d16ed8522a033941de69a89b83e78199d)\n\nMy thesis on Fisker remains unchanged. The company is undervalued based on my own valuation system. They are undervalued based on basic forward-looking earnings. They are under-valued based on the existing stock of finished product that is awaiting delivery. They are undervalued based on my own subjective analysis of their design fundamentals - which I think are excellent and beyond that, THE DESIGN PRINCIPLES ARE TIME-TESTED. Henrik Fisker is not a new-comer. He's got a proven track record and more importantly, he's got a chip on his shoulder.\n\nDisregard my advice at your own peril. Here's how I did in the markets today:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[If you made more money than me today, feel free to go about your business. But I only obey one rule: COFFEE IS FOR CLOSERS. If you made less than $8,742 in the stock market today than sit the fuck down. ](https://preview.redd.it/87gej92mg66c1.png?width=397&format=png&auto=webp&s=732772c5cf2b59c358b584a68813970b2a3c2ae8)\n\nAh yes, and the obligatory 'ITS wAlL sTrEeT BeTs, lET'S maKE iT sHoRt sQUeEze!' data:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[38&#37; of the float is sold short. That means that once the stock finds a bottom, 38&#37; of the shares need to be bought back. This will not be a squeeze to the moon.

He said the central bank would **target a monthly devaluation of 2%**.\n\nCaputo said the moves, which were welcomed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), would be painful in the short-term but were needed to cut the country\u2019s fiscal deficit and bring down soaring triple digit inflation.\n\nArgentina\u2019s central bank is due to announce new monetary measures on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe objective is simply to avoid catastrophe and get the economy back on track,\u201d Caputo said, in a recorded speech. **\u201cThere is no more money.\u201d**\n\nHe said the country needed to tackle a deep fiscal deficit he put at 5.5% of gross domestic product, arguing that Argentina had an \u201caddiction\u201d to fiscal deficits, 113 over the last 123 years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to solve this problem at the root,\u201d he said. \u201cFor this we need to solve our addiction to a fiscal deficit.\u201d\n\nThe South American country, a large grain producer, has an **inflation rate nearing 150%**, central bank reserves deep in the red and two-fifths of the population in poverty. Other measures announced include halving the number of government ministries.\n\nArgentina also has a $44bn (\u00a335bn) loan with the IMF.\n\n\u201cI welcome the decisive measures,\u201d said Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the IMF, calling it \u201can important step toward restoring stability and rebuilding the country\u2019s economic potential\u201d.\n\nThe IMF described the measures as \u201cbold\u201d and said they would \u201chelp stabilise the economy and set the basis for more sustainable and private sector-led growth\u201d after \u201cserious policy setbacks\u201d in recent months.\n\nArgentina\u2019s foreign exchange and grains markets had been locked down on Tuesday as traders awaited the new government\u2019s economic plan. Banks had already anticipated a sharp devaluation, with some weakening their foreign exchange rate to 700 pesos a dollar.\n\nSince 2019, the Argentinian peso has been kept artificially strong by strict capital controls that create a wide gap between the official exchange rate of 366 a dollar and **parallel rates as high as 1,000 a dollar**. **\\[**[**Unofficial Dollar rate**](https://bluedollar.net/informal-rate/)**\\]**\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always worse off because our response has been to attack the consequences but not the problem,\u201d Caputo said in his address. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve come to do is the opposite of what they always did, and that\u2019s solve the root problem.\u201d\n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/13/argentina-new-government-devalues-peso-economic-crisis](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/13/argentina-new-government-devalues-peso-economic-crisis)", "id": "18hzegr", "created_utc": 1702524773.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|6|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10858607292175293}, {"body": "Calls on Messi", "score": 42, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2613019049167633}, {"body": "Im argentinian. 15 years of socialism and being a narco state sucks.

{"title": "Hate to PISS on your parade", "selftext": "It\u2019s the \u201cI Told You SO\u201d guy and I hate to piss on your \u201cinflation dead bro\u201d parade. Fellow regards, inflation is already entrenched in the system. It has moved from goods to services (which is what 70% of US consumers spent on) and it\u2019s nearly impossible to remove without a severe recession--which is nowhere in sight. While the inflation in goods has been caused by supply chain shocks, commodities spike, and money printing, those have pretty much gone away now. However, they have shifted toward services where labor costs are the main cause! Wages are very sticky and folks are not willing to take pay cuts just to save the economy from inflation. At the same time, people are still spending like no tomorrow so there are no reasons for businesses to stop hiring people or raising wages. \n\nJust take a look at retail sales 2023\n\n[https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts\\_current.pdf](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/anmywde2bc6c1.jpg?width=781&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed4946962c5abf4948d55e3aec2fdbe3bf00bea2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k8j718b4bc6c1.jpg?width=694&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c7e2f887662b82d0ef927c445e2e3f9bbd69c44\n\nWolf Ritcher from wolfstreet.com has provided charts of the data for a 10 years period. This is the total retail sales, with 3 month average to smooth it out. I draw the green line to show the average trend. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sctzaou5bc6c1.jpg?width=585&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b18f9879c5789f2470ce4e1bd5de171a04d5b88c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhere the f\\*\\*k are all you broke ass Mfers got money to buy all these stuff! Do you think Arthur Burns, oops I mean Jay Powell, will cut rates with this kind of stupid spending? He is raising rates to tame down on demands so you all stop spending! He is asking you regards to STOP buying/trading monkey jpegs and imaginary tokens, and do you really think he is succeeding??? Do you think he is done? With an unemployment rate at 3.7%? \n\nDo you think this time is different? Do you think the Phillips curve and the law of economics will be suspended in mid-air? For regards that don\u2019t know, the Phillips Curve represents the relationship between unemployment and inflation. You cannot have low inflation with low unemployment. Unless the inflation number and/or unemployment number are rigged. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/07jhrf37bc6c1.jpg?width=616&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ac9cb29d1efd1832a3b93b7f44f870eb65f6a2b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion\n\nJay Powell has failed to get the US consumers to stop spending. Without a recession, prices for services will NOT go down voluntarily! Rate cuts in 2024 will only pour gasoline on the inflation fire. POWELL KNOWS THIS! He does not want to be known as Arthur Burns!!! He is using  one of the tools from the FED toolkit which is to jawbone you to think P1v0t is coming! It\u2019s NOT. The US economy is almost 70% consumers spending and until you monkeys stop spending, there will be no recession. There\u2019s no reason for him to risk inflation skyrocketing back up again! With the markets up (DOW at record high, SPY close to record high), the wealth efforts will pour more gasoline on the fire.  \n\nSource\n\n[https://wolfstreet.com/2023/12/14/our-drunken-sailors-go-splurging-online-at-auto-dealers-and-massively-at-bars-restaurants-yolo/](https://wolfstreet.com/2023/12/14/our-drunken-sailors-go-splurging-online-at-auto-dealers-and-massively-at-bars-restaurants-yolo/) \n\n[https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/retail-sales-03-november-showing-americans-continue-spend-105654827](https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/retail-sales-03-november-showing-americans-continue-spend-105654827) \n\n[https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/about-phillips-curve/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/about-phillips-curve/) \n\n[https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/1364/economics/phillips-curve-explained/](https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/1364/economics/phillips-curve-explained/)  ", "id": "18il847", "created_utc": 1702594665.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|102|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.018227197229862213}, {"body": "So what should I buy calls on?", "score": 30, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.024909112602472305}, {"body": "Puts on this guys portfolio lol", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Lets see PFE, BABA, VZ, etc. I definitely pick winners", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "lol prob the only 3 stocks that haven\u2019t squeezed all year lol safe is boring and apparently not profitable lol", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29147738218307495}], "tickers": ["pfe"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.0031128274276852608}, {"body": "I do think the unemployment data is a bit wonky for Oct and Nov - most of the jobs were government and health, and other jobs were those returning from strikes.
