Many read how expensive H100 are and think that if AMD undercuts pricing then Nvidia is screwed.\n\nThis is alot of the Intel vs. AMD thinking where it's true because you can swap Intel x86 CPUs for AMD x86 CPUs. But in AI solutions you can't swap Nvidia GPUs simply with AMD GPUs because the data center infrastructure and operational SW as well as frameworks up to the application layers are different. In x86 there is a common platform / ecosystem so you can easily switch chips.\n\nIn AI, there is a Nvidia platform / ecosystem (from CUDA to Enterprise AI) and otherwise it's DIY. Yes, there is no alternative complete all-in-on solution to Nvidia. You would have to see which HW to get, you have to build up expertise, you would have to make many different open source frameworks work together and so on. CSPs only partially offer solutions there but not a complete solution. With Nvidia you get a complete Enterprise graded and secure solution from top layer to bottom layer. Yes, it's not cheap but you can get started immediately as you can work with data aggregation on Nvidia workstations supporting CUDA while you wait for H100 deployments.\n\nNvidia's business model is directed at all the enterprises in the world who want to utilize AI for their business without doing AI DIY with their own SW development. Many companies who want to deploy LLMs aren't interested in getting deep into AI expertise, they want to buy the expertise and get their custom solution for their company data. So they look for a partner in this. Think of all the non-tech companies in manufacturing, automotive, medicine, biology, construction, finance, insurance, travel and many more.

However, I have a substantial account size of over 1.5mil, i stared very small contract sizes and have been closely following u/scottishtrader mechanics of trading, big thanks for his huge efforts of sharing his experiences.\n\nFrom time to time I was playing going long put or calls on TSLA\n\n99% of the time \\`I was very discipline to follow the rules. And I was doing very fine.\n\nAnd overall profits for the first 9 month was about 190K usd for the 1.7mil porftolio\n\nThen I just started arguing with the market regarding the hype of AI and came NVDA, that sold OTM 2-3 delat OTM calls, which for me looked as the sure profit thing, as i was very confident that the market is just way everpricing the value of NVDA.\n\nBUM!!!!after earnings came out, i got 250K loss. More over I was shorting the stock by direct equity short.   \nI got beaten so heavily and it was a huge cost for an option trading education.  \nI told myself get back to the rules and started doing good again. For the next 5 month i made 160K usd. \n\nMid november I got cocky again, while consicous that i am again trying to argue the market, i started selling calls and puts on spx, and normally having a quite diversified CSPs among many fundamentally strong companies, I happened to trade mostly SPX and more over increased the level of trading to increase the theta employing selling call credit spreads.   \nEventually, all you know it ended me taking losses for the december of around 96K, and december I will probably will finish also in the red territory of around 30-40K.   \nHuge losses most of the time came from me not closing loosing position at 21DTR according to Tastymechanics. Which ended up for the position to be hit with huge gamma risk and losses where just mounting.  \nI was not closing at 21DTE, coz i was hoping the market will turnaround, i could not exercise SPX, and was keeping and stretching the loosing position.  \nBottome line for the beginners from the beginner  \n\n\n\\- Always overweight in short PUTS.

This will mean a smaller sales tax as well. As an example of this please see 2019 when this occurred twice by Tesla.\n\nThe kicker will be, when everyone realizes the federal tax credit was just a pass thru to Tesla. Because Tesla was only worth the:\n\n* Full price - $7500 = real price\n* Reduced price - $3750 = real price\n* fully reduced price - $0 rebates = real\nprice\n\nWhich means every penny YOU got in rebates went directly to Tesla motors and customers were left holding the sales tax bags and diminished value because the resale values keep tanking.\n\nALL rebates for Tesla are just a gov't pass thru to Tesla's bottom line.
