{"title": "Bullish on Roblox (RBLX) regrettably...", "selftext": "Disclosure: I own 7 calls at a $50 strike price for 6/21/2024. Stock is currently trading at 43.98 USD at the time of posting. \n\nFor personal reasons I really wanted to see this company fail after having my Roblox account hacked and losing all my items (valued at $3k in PV) but unfortunately, they are growing and will continue to do so. Roblox isn't just a video game company, they are also a virtual economy, as well as a tech company.\n\nFundamentally they have created a platform that is even more customizable, creative, and deep in content than any video game in history. You can play COD, Dead By Daylight (just released by the studio behind FNAF), Roller Coaster Simulators, ELF (video game based on the movie, Tycoon Games, and more. Literally any game you can think of, you can play on this platform. \n\nThe ingenious way they make profit is similar to how Steam does - by creating their own economy where users can buy upgrades in games, clothing, and most importantly limited-release collectibles that appreciate over time. The main difference is you can only buy and sell within their issued currency: Robux. Effectively allowing them to manipulate the value by raising the price to buy and sell Robux at their own discretion. This has the potential to allow them to create insane markups on their items over time. \n\nE.g. [https://www.roblox.com/catalog/1285307/Sparkle-Time-Fedora](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/1285307/Sparkle-Time-Fedora) \\- the Sparkle Time Fedora, released in 2006 as a free christmas gift is selling for 1,730,000 Robux - the equivalent of 2150 CAD today ([https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux?ctx-nav](https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux?ctx-nav)). As a result many players are buying and holding items, some of which are sold in numbered amounts 1/1000, 1/350, etc, holding their value even in the face of inflation. E.g. [https://www.roblox.com/catalog/35685368/Scorpion-Pendant](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/35685368/Scorpion-Pendant) released with 400 numbered units, retailing for 17,499 Robux or 220 CAD versus 148 CAD, 180 days ago.\n\nIf you take a look at the charts over time, their items tend to only go in one direction, up - which is due to an increasing user base shown in financials. Revenue hit $713.2 million, up 38% year-over-year; Average Daily Active Users (\u201cDAUs\u201d) were 70.2 million, up 20% year-over-year; and hours engaged were 16.0 billion, up 20% year-over-year. \n\nSuffice it to say they are expanding and with the collaborations they have been having with the Chain Smokers, Lil Naz X, the Weeknd, Disney, Dead by Daylight, and more, they are successfully creating brand partnerships that are raising awareness as well as driving consumers towards their product.\n\nIn terms of liquidity they have 2.1 Billion in cash which they have been using to lower expenditure costs from their data centres, invest in more developers and partnerships, and continue on the path towards profitability.\n\nIn the short-term macroeconomic environment, we have the holidays coming up, and if you talk to a lot of parents, kids are going crazy for Roblox and have been asking for giftcards they can use for the game. I predict this will give the stock a bump of up to 40% if we follow the same pattern last year (28 USD on Dec 30th to 37.75 by Jan 27th).\n\nIn the long-term Roblox's technology is insane. They have full software support for VR, a giant user base, and the ability for users/developers to come in and build anything. Not to mention it is lucrative for them as well, as they take a large share of profits from anything bought within their game. With VR technology becoming cheaper year over year, this really is the only company that has all the infrastructure built for anyone to create a full immersive world be it video game developers, businesses, etc. Not a huge metaverse fan in general, but keeping this as a hedge in case widespread adoption occurs isn't a bad idea.\n\nIn short, I think Roblox has a lot of room to grow, with insane potential for growth over the next few years. I'm confident that even in the face of rising inflation (which is not likely given the rate cuts coming next year) they will continue to grow and expand to the point where they can use their debt sovereignty within their own economy to raise more profit over the long term. Not to mention their ability to license their tech to other companies wishing to capitalize on the immersive VR world.", "id": "18nudfj", "created_utc": 1703185127.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "Those calls seem expensive.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Actually looking at it again and the historical volatility is 27.35 versus an implied volatility of 52.95.

{"title": "Roblox DD - Bullish regrettably\u2026", "selftext": "Disclosure: I own 7 calls at a $50 strike price for 6/21/2024. Stock is currently trading at 43.98 USD at the time of posting. \n\nFor personal reasons I really wanted to see this company fail after having my Roblox account hacked and losing all my items (valued at $3k in PV) but unfortunately, they are growing and will continue to do so. Roblox isn't just a video game company, they are also a virtual economy, as well as a tech company.\n\nFundamentally they have created a platform that is even more customizable, creative, and deep in content than any video game in history. You can play COD, Dead By Daylight (just released by the studio behind FNAF), Roller Coaster Simulators, ELF (video game based on the movie, Tycoon Games, and more. Literally any game you can think of, you can play on this platform. \n\nThe ingenious way they make profit is similar to how Steam does - by creating their own economy where users can buy upgrades in games, clothing, and most importantly limited-release collectibles that appreciate over time. The main difference is you can only buy and sell within their issued currency: Robux. Effectively allowing them to manipulate the value by raising the price to buy and sell Robux at their own discretion. This has the potential to allow them to create insane markups on their items over time. \n\nE.g. [https://www.roblox.com/catalog/1285307/Sparkle-Time-Fedora](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/1285307/Sparkle-Time-Fedora) \\- the Sparkle Time Fedora, released in 2006 as a free christmas gift is selling for 1,730,000 Robux - the equivalent of 2150 CAD today ([https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux?ctx-nav](https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux?ctx-nav)). As a result many players are buying and holding items, some of which are sold in numbered amounts 1/1000, 1/350, etc, holding their value even in the face of inflation. E.g. [https://www.roblox.com/catalog/35685368/Scorpion-Pendant](https://www.roblox.com/catalog/35685368/Scorpion-Pendant) released with 400 numbered units, retailing for 17,499 Robux or 220 CAD versus 148 CAD, 180 days ago.\n\nIf you take a look at the charts over time, their items tend to only go in one direction, up - which is due to an increasing user base shown in financials. Revenue hit $713.2 million, up 38% year-over-year; Average Daily Active Users (\u201cDAUs\u201d) were 70.2 million, up 20% year-over-year; and hours engaged were 16.0 billion, up 20% year-over-year. \n\nSuffice it to say they are expanding and with the collaborations they have been having with the Chain Smokers, Lil Naz X, the Weeknd, Disney, Dead by Daylight, and more, they are successfully creating brand partnerships that are raising awareness as well as driving consumers towards their product.\n\nIn terms of liquidity they have 2.1 Billion in cash which they have been using to lower expenditure costs from their data centres, invest in more developers and partnerships, and continue on the path towards profitability.\n\nIn the short-term macroeconomic environment, we have the holidays coming up, and if you talk to a lot of parents, kids are going crazy for Roblox and have been asking for giftcards they can use for the game. I predict this will give the stock a bump of up to 40% if we follow the same pattern last year (28 USD on Dec 30th to 37.75 by Jan 27th).\n\nIn the long-term Roblox's technology is insane. They have full software support for VR, a giant user base, and the ability for users/developers to come in and build anything. Not to mention it is lucrative for them as well, as they take a large share of profits from anything bought within their game. With VR technology becoming cheaper year over year, this really is the only company that has all the infrastructure built for anyone to create a full immersive world be it video game developers, businesses, etc. Not a huge metaverse fan in general, but keeping this as a hedge in case widespread adoption occurs isn't a bad idea.\n\nIn short, I think Roblox has a lot of room to grow, with insane potential for growth over the next few years. I'm confident that even in the face of rising inflation (which is not likely given the rate cuts coming next year) they will continue to grow and expand to the point where they can use their debt sovereignty within their own economy to raise more profit over the long term. Not to mention their ability to license their tech to other companies wishing to capitalize on the immersive VR world.", "id": "18nuia3", "created_utc": 1703185455.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "Have you looked at other games lately?
