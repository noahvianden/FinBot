Now everything is so much clearer -- hence the suffering stock price.  No one has a crystal ball and can predict this. \n\nI would say to sell the stock.  It is at a relative high compared to the softening EV market, competition, indefinitely delayed FSD delivery, and tarnished image Tesla now has.  Tesla will continue to be a strong player, but the market for BEV buyers is shrinking as most who could buy have already bought. \n\nThere are other growth companies you can get into on the ground floor such as Rocket Lab.

Here are issues with the points you made: \n\nOptimus:  Musk introduced the robot in 2021 and claimed in 2022 that it would be ready for mass production in 2023.  Sound familiar?  He made similar promises about FSD and the new Roadster which still haven't arrived yet. \n\nThere are several humanoid robot companies with more advanced robots available today with some going into mass production soon if not already.  Competing car manufacturers could easily pick some up for use in their factories if they are useful without the hundreds of millions in investment. \n\nTesla's AI chips are more application specific than Nvidia.  They do vision based AI well, but everything else poorly.  Even the vision is poor when you take into account the poor performance of the vision powered automatic windshield wipers and the still poorly performing FSD (relative to SAE level 4/5 requirements).  Tesla AI chips with Dojo training will leap frog them on certain abilities, but the rest will still lag behind robots which are further ahead. \n\nThe 25k car is still years away.  They are just now modeling how the factory might work and haven't even shown what it will look like.  It is an R&D project that is still continuing today, but don't expect anything soon (similar to Dojo where it has been discussed for years and still hasn't fully come on line). \n\nThe CyberTruck is widely believed to be a non-significant contributor to the bottom line, but more of a \"halo\" car as described by one analyst.  Same goes with the semis, where 100 x $200k ($20M) is a rounding error for their $95B in revenue. \n\nThe barriers of entry for an electric car include requiring the consumer have ample capital and/or credit, a garage/carport for charging, very flexible transport requirements (limited towing requirements, ample time for stopping to charge on long trips), and a tech mind willing to learn and adjust to the requirements of BEV ownership and operation.  I've known people who bought a BEV without all those requirements filled, and either went back to gas or complain constantly about what a mistake it was to buy a BEV. \n\nThat market is becoming saturated.  It doesn't matter if you are Tesla or another brand.  It will affect all BEV makers.  If the BEVs aren't practically given away to ICE owners in return for trading in their gas guzzlers, they will likely continue to spurn them.  Either that, or gas prices have to go up considerably.  That won't happen without the government subsidizing gas cars to keep elected officials in office -- at least for the next 5 to 10 years when prices of BEVs come down and manufacturing is high enough to replace nearly the entire US fleet of ICE cars. \n\nCurrent analysts are expecting 2024 sales to be flat to 20% higher than 2023, but EPS shrank for 2023 and is likely to continue into 2024.
