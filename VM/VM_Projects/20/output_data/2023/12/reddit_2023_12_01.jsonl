{"title": "Efficient Process to Create an Option Strategy", "selftext": "Tl;Dr. Creating a general process to efficiently test the validity of an option strategy will save us time and money. I've found that a 5 step process works really well: 1. Outline the strategy, 2. backtest / forward test; 3. papertrade; 4. test deploy; 5. scale. \n\nThe goal of this post is to share how I approached creating option strategies to hopefully give newer traders some ideas on how they can create their own. To help outline the process, I'll use an example.\n\n* 1. Outlined the Strategy.\n   * I start with what I'm trying to accomplish and what I think the perceived edge is for a given strategy. In this case, I will use weekend decay. \n   * Hypothesis: we know we can accelerate the returns for short premium strategies by expanding our holdings during non-trading market periods. Holidays and weekends offer opportunities to gain exposure. This strategy will focus on the weekend effect but applies to holiday periods as well.\n   * Researching hypothesis: \n      * First, we can explore research that's already been conducted on this effect to more efficiently research it. \n      * Connolly, R. A. 1989. An examination of the robustness of the Weekend Effect. Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis 24 (2)\n      * Keim, D. B., and R. F. Stambaugh. 1984. A further investigation of the Weekend Effect in stock returns. \n      * Lakonishok, J., and E. Maberly. 1990. The Weekend Effect: Trading patterns of individual and institutional investors. \n      * Schwert. 2002. Anomalies and Market Efficiency\n   * Testing hypothesis:\n      * Now that I know there's efficacy behind this hypothesis, I need to think of how I want to trade it. To take advantage of the average mispricing of IV leading into and through the weekend, I will look at short premium strategies that look at variance risk premiums vs directional strategies. \n      * I will explore short straddles, short strangles, short iron flys, and short iron condors. \n      * I need to outline the key variables I want to consider: I will use the nearest expiration after the weekend and will enter Fridays before the close (need to test time to enter). I need to test if I want to take to expiration, or exit early. I need to test what deltas perform the best. I also want to see if VIX has any impact on profitability. Finally, how will I manage losing trades? \n* 2. Backtesting:\n   * After reviewing this various permutations, I test a large timeframe (15 years) for an initial look then zoom in to more recent data to assess if it's still viable using the following timeframes (2019-2023 YTD). Parsing through the prelim data, I find that Iron Condors perform the best for my needs (although they are not the highest returning). I found that the optimal entry time is 1230 (PT)\n   * From there, want to understand what width performs the best and I find the wider spread in general performs best 30 delta shorts, 5 delta longs\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gnc6ejjabl3c1.png?width=923&format=png&auto=webp&s=537f35bbc46e85ec2854b8e91f69569a0190a864\n\n* 3. Papertrade. This is where I will assess the efficacy of the best performing structures to explore how I would actually trade it. I also use paper trading to create a dataset so I can continue to evaluate what variations perform the best, markets move. I've already paper traded this phenomenon ad nauseum and continue to do so to review various permutations. It remains efficacious. \n* 4. Test deploy. This is where I will test the smallest size possible, typically at least 4 months to see how it performs, how I react, and to finalize the remaining details. \n* 5. Scale. Below are the results of the strategy (I've traded this for years but I'm sharing 2023 results)\n   * I run the trade using 5lots. There is some variance from the backtest results which I imagine is no surprise to anyone here. Real trading isn't the same as back testing. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g0mcxky6el3c1.png?width=152&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad778892cf67773665ba1d491577dc6567a900e1\n\nAs always, if there are any questions - happy to help however I can.
