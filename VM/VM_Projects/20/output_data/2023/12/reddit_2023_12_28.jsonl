Below is a summary of the year, hope to get feedback and learnings from the good folks here.\n\n1. Liquidated my company stocks Nov 2022 and decided to stop weeklies and start wheeling. Started with ~115k\n\n2. Decided that I will focus on only few undervalued stocks.with decent premium rather than staring at monitor for multiple set ups, since I also have a full time jobs.\n\n3. Two initial stock picks were twlo and ttd, got the stocks cheap and sold covered calls(1000 shares each). Not sure if this is a good risk management strategy but helped me narrow the plays I feel would work.\n\n4. TTD got called away early, so started looking at NET. But made few thousands on TTD\n\n5. Had some success with CSPs on NET, until I did the mistake of playing the earnings in may, and stock crashed 20% leaving me bagholding 1000 shares and 15000$ hole.\n\n6. Then did the second mistake of selling coverd call on net way below my assigned price for peanuts and guess what, stock sky rocketed leaving me in 12000$ hole. You can check my post history.\n\n7. Based on the suggestions (and ridicule) given by the good folks in the group, I rolled the call for a credit to nov 2022 to minimize the loss. So finally when I closed the rolled position after few months I incurred a net loss of 7000$.\n\n8. On the bright side I was able to sell covered calls on net in to the bull market and eventually my net stocks got called away at 73$ for a 21k profit. And also made enough premiums to negate the 7000$ loss.\n\n9. Meantime I also wheeled twlo, 50% of my capital was struck on Net fiasco recovery and eventually twlo got called away 64$ for a nice profit.\n\n10. On the downside the stocks are worth way more than when they were excersiced, but no regrets.i know that's bound to happen.\n\n11. After NET and TWLO, I also dabbled with rblx and docu, eventually those got called away too for few thousands (could have been way more had I held it).\n\n12. Ending the year with a realized profit of ~76500$. I have taken out ~50k to cover expenses and pay estimated taxes. Most of profits are from stocks getting called away than from premiums.\n\n13. No positions going in to 2024, I'm sitting on 150k account, looking to play PyPl and any another undervalued stock and hope theta gods bless me this year with slow steady gains.\n\nScreenshot attached, looking forward to your comments and suggestions. \n\nHappy New Year theta gang!!", "id": "18t1nhj", "created_utc": 1703790149.0, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "the obligatory congrats and fuck you", "score": 34, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10798071324825287}, {"body": "WTG, nice write up.\n\nI'm also looking to play PYPL, just waiting for a nice dip and the new year to begin.

{"title": "The Case for Small caps", "selftext": "Intro:\n\nThe Caps are small, but the gains are not. No Cap.\n\nI have been thinking of writing up a case for small caps for a few of weeks now. One of my last notes from my TLT post called out my expectations for small caps leading into 2024. Thoughts on small caps into EOY from Dec 12th. Since that time TNA has rocketed up 28%. Sadly my covered calls from the shares I purchased at $28.75 have long been called away at $33. I was not prepared for such a rapid move up after the last FOMC meeting and Powell\u2019s (FOMC Chair) dovish rhetoric. As of this writing, TNA is trading at $41.29. That being said, with a little help from the macro environment, this still has room to move higher. Let\u2019s dig in.\n\nBackdrop and Set-up:\n\nAs the Fed hiked interest rates, small caps languished while the venture capital to support these companies dried up and as loans grew scarce with higher interest rates. Now that we seem to be escaping this restrictive environment we should begin to see a run on small caps. Let\u2019s can start by looking into the set up here. There are a few things I really like, and I will use TNA\u2019s big brother IWM (Russell 2000 small cap index), to distill my views. First I want to look at some trade volume data, as of today:\n\n\nMost of these circles represent trades that are greater than 99% of all trades ever made on IWM. There are a few trades, given where we were historically, that stick out to me, and that I think were buys. The number 8 and 16th largest trades ever were placed around $180 at the end of November, just ahead of the Fed decision and CPI data in December. Around that time we had already seen softer data in both the jobs market and on the inflation front. I detail all of this here in, The Case for TLT. A smart trader placed an educated bet ahead of these events. I can only say this with some certainty, but they are such large trades, it would seem logical that they were bullish given the circumstances around that time. Either way, nobody expected Jpow to go full, \u201cwhen doves cry\u201d on FOMC day. So they were lucky if it was a buy.\n\nThat is where we stand today. Big trades are being made and the macro headwinds are letting up. Let us look at some pictures!\n\nCharting / Crayons / Astrology for Stocks:\n\nThis is what I find very interesting, if you\u2019re into the witch craft of charting. IWM is sitting at some very important techincal levels. lets look at the 10yr timeframe.\n\n\nTwo things here, small caps are breaking out from a long held range between $160-200 and we are breaking above a very long term mid-trend line, in red. If we can hold $200, I think this pushes higher, but a retest of the mid 190s is also not out of the question. This wouldn\u2019t shock me short term, but I am thinking for the full year 2024 here, so a pull back after this run doesn\u2019t concern me.\n\nOne other thing I would like to point out is where the small cap index stands relative to its all time highs (ATH). If we do get into a friendlier rate environment, I don\u2019t see why we can\u2019t retest those highs, after all, its peers, QQQ and SPY are both testing or at their ATH right now! Seen below.\n\n\n\nBy that measure the Russell 2000 has another 16% of room left to run - which is 48% for TNA as its 3x leveraged. And it\u2019s coming out of a cold cold winter.\n\nOne other thing I want to show here are the moving averages:\n\n\nRed = 200SMA, Yellow = 50SMA, and Green = 20SMA (simple moving average).\n\nWe are on the verge of a golden cross (50MA crossing over 200MA). Given the other factors, this looks like it will break higher. These MAs and the 20MA should be supports also, therefore we have several supports from $200-180. The downside risk here isn\u2019t that bad. Unless somehting changes on the macro level, we wont sniff $180. But let\u2019s discuss those risks anyway.\n\nPotential Downside (risks):\n\nStarting off with the glaring divergence in expectations vs. what the Fed is saying, in relation to the rate cut expectations for 2024. As we stand, the Fed is leaning towards 3 cuts in 2024 according to their FOMC economic projects, seen below, around 4.65 mid:\n\n\nHowever! The market, in its infinite wisdom, is pricing in up to 7, count em, 7 cuts. Sorry for the sloppy highlight job. 5.25 to 3.50.\n\n\nThis presents a pretty harsh reality for small caps if we don\u2019t get those expected cuts, even worse if we get less, or lord forbid\u2026..a hike.\n\nGoing-on-a-hike GIFs - Get the best GIF on GIPHY\nGoing hand in hand with this are concerns over, war, inflation, deflation, slowing economic growth and so on. You can come up with any number of problems for this trade, but this is true of all trades. It\u2019s just good to be aware of the potential pitfalls so that you\u2019re on the lookout for a turn in any one of these. This allows you to monitor your perspective and adjust accordingly.\n\nConclusion:\n\nGiven what we know, not what may be, I am looking to open a TNA position again. I\u2019d prefer a pullback under $200 on IWM and to get TNA in the mid 30s. En lieu of that, I will write a cash secured put or a put credit spread somewhere in the $30s. This is a trade that will need heavy monitoring of economic conditions and what rates are up too. It\u2019s probably also good to look at other small cap ETFs in individual sectors, to see how they are doing. One of the most beat down was Bio in 2022-23, so something like LABU can possibly give an early warning, as it will be the first to sour.\n\nCurrently I have no open position for TNA or IWM.

With a friendlier rate environment, small caps will take off. Buy IWM or TNA around $200. Use stop losses around $180-190. Hold into 2024 with a target of ATHs in the range of $250-270 for IWM.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6759005188941956}, {"body": "You had me at \"no cap\".", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29387757182121277}, {"body": "High risk and high reward.

This bodes well for small cap companies which tend to be more domestically focused than large multinationals. Additionally, tax reform should provide a tailwind as lower corporate rates boost profitability and encourage investment back into the United States.\n2) With interest rates remaining low by historical standards, equity valuations look attractive relative to other asset classes such as bonds or cash equivalents. As such, money continues flowing into stocks pushing prices higher across the board - including small caps which have lagged their large cap counterparts over the past few years but are now catching up fast..
