For example, I\u2019d like to buy this MSFT Nov 310 Call, but 2K is quite the amount for me, but I\u2019m willing to risk it, because I\u2019m sure the stock will increase enough till Nov that I\u2019ll lock in a profit.

My recommendation: no, don't do it. If you want to buy the stock because you think they're going the right direction, do that. But an option is not the place for this one now.\n\nRemember always that theta eventually dooms a long position on any option. Even a call with a far out expiration date on a highly stable, top-tier company that appears to be doing everything right will meet its fate. This particular one would fade quite slowly but fade it will.  You won't profit without continued upward pressure on the stock and that is more likely going to flop around like a crazy thing in this market than otherwise, particularly with how volatile AI is right now. Don't put yourself in the middle of it.\n\nMSFT is still maxed out. I believe that will change within the next two years but I don't have enough confidence in my sense of timing to put thousands on the table.  IMO, MSFT is a good place to do DCA, and if not on the stock directly at its hefty per-share price, then on an index fund that is based on it, where the shares are cheaper. Profitability from an option buy on the main equity will hinge on timing, and who gets that right? No one does.\n\nIf you want to get into options, an underpriced stock is the place to be. Amazon is cheaper per-share than Microsoft and, at least to many analysts, still seems a bit low. If not them, find another with similar value. If you want some stability in your income on options, buy yourself 100 shares of something solid, then wheel your way to success by selling call options, taking profitable assignments, and rebuying low. Again, you might find this doesn't really work the way you want but it's a lot less risky.\n\nGood luck! As an aside, I'm doing conventional investment now and staying away from options.
