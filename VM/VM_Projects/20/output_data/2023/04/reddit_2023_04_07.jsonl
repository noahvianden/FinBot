{"title": "Jobs report shows 236,000 gain in March. Hot labor market shows some hints of cooling", "selftext": "The U.S. added a robust 236,000 new jobs in March, defying the Federal Reserve\u2019s hopes for a big slowdown in hiring as central bank struggles to tame high inflation.\n\nEconomists polled by The Wall Street Journal had forecast 238,000 new jobs.\n\nWhile the increase in hiring was the smallest in more than two years, the number of new jobs created last month was still stronger than is typically the case.\n\nThe unemployment rate, meanwhile, slipped to 3.5% from 3.6%.\n\nThere was some good news in the report for the Fed, though.\n\nWage growth continued to moderate closer to level the Fed would prefer, for one thing.\n\nHourly wages increased a mild 0.3% last month. And the increase in pay over the past year slowed again to a nearly two-year low of 4.2% from 4.6% in February.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the share of people working or looking for work rose a tick to 62.6%. That\u2019s the highest labor-force participation rate since the last month before the pandemic in February 2020.\n\nWhen more people look for work, companies don\u2019t have to compete as much for workers via higher pay.\n\nEmerging evidence of slack in a muscular U.S. labor market could encourage the Fed to take a breather after a rapid series of interest-rate increases. Yet the reduced demand for labor could also be taken as a sign the economy is getting weaker.\n\nStocks rallied after the report.\n\nThe solid increase in employment last month followed a revised 326,000 gain in February and 472,000 in January, the government said Friday.\n\nThe U.S. has added a combined 1 million-plus new jobs in the first three months of the year.\n\n**Key details:** About one-third of the new jobs created last month (72,000) were at service-side companies such as bars and restaurants whose employment still has not returned to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nAmericans are going out to eat a lot and spending relatively more on services than on goods.\n\nGovernment employment increased by 47,000. Hiring also rose at professional businesses and in health care.\n\nRetailers cut 15,000 jobs. Employment also fell slightly in manufacturing and construction.\n\n**Big picture:** For all the strength in the labor market, the U.S. economy is starting to show more signs of deterioration.\n\nManufacturers have cut production, for instance, and are arguably already in recession.

I will ALWAYS find a way to post and once again NEVER assume that i just abandoned you guys... \n\n**We are taking a family trip to Disney next week and I will be gone until Thursday night\u2026 next daily/ weekly ta will be posted on April 14th. I will not be trading during this time.** \n\n**CPI**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvk6zn8e6hsa1.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd44581839a9f408da46521afd1b08fd97a1da93\n\nWe will officially get CPI on Wednesday. As of now its actually more interesting to see what the numbers are going to be then not. As of right now CPI YoY is pretty much a guaranteed beat, and CPI MoM is most likely to also beat (be lower than previous).\n\nNow where things are going to get interesting and where I truly once again after 3-4 months of opens that have done nothing but burn everyone on CPI can no recommend anyone play CPI\u2026 But Core YoY is as of now likely to miss (be higher than previous) and there is a decent chance that Core MoM is unchanged or misses too\u2026 \n\nIf we get a miss on CORE I could see a pretty negative market reaction. In the end CORE should have more weight than that of CPI. Here are my thoughts\u2026 If we get a good CPI (so lower than previous) then there is a pretty solid chance the pivot narrative is going to increase and we could very well rally for 2 weeks into the next FOMC. However, IF CORE is higher there is a pretty solid chance that we could continue to price in a 25bps hike.. If we do that then we are likely to see choppy ranges to a slightly sell off over the next two weeks. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vl2refch6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=deae6d3d454dd2aecd59beda5f77b60cb616f444\n\nCurrently we actually (kinda surprising) have a 67.4% chance of a 25bps hike on May 3rds FOMC. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a45pvjph6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=89fb3720b586a5a6e0e5d18732afd2206c668779\n\nNow what is extra spicy and extra unique about this Wednesdays CPI release is that at 830am we have CPI numbers dropping, however, we also have the FOMC minutes releasing at 2pm the same day. Both of these days are extremely volatile in and of themselves. Add the fires together and its going to be a very interesting day to say the least! \n\nOne thing I find interesting with FOMC minutes AND CPI being Wednesday is that the IV is very low still sitting at 16% currently. I do expect this to ramp up as the week comes into Wednesday though. \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47wwg75i6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=dadbad04dbec4157c914c79a3bce5a8696b1ec00\n\nDaily wise we once again attempted to break down and touch 405.17 supply (now support) however we unable to get there once again. I mentioned last week that IF the daily is in extreme bull momentum (which we are) then we should likely look to the daily 8ema to provide a bounce on any sort of sell off. Well we have officially touched and bounced off the daily 8ema. \n\nThe favortism now goes to if we get a green day Monday to see a new demand (support) put in at 406.64 which then leads to yet again another run to 411.04 if not 414.13 to 417.03. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/69isveji6hsa1.png?width=837&format=png&auto=webp&s=07efddf1862f7ce0a990687e6efb6932226137a2\n\nFrom a weekly perspective we have once again found ourselves attempting to breach that 409.98 supply (resistance) and have not been able to do that. If and when we break through that then we could very well see a push to that next major supply (resistance) at 427.53. \n\nNow this is where the Daily and Weekly team differs. On SPY daily we are closer to putting in a new demand (support) then we are putting in a new supply (resistance), however, when we look at the weekly we are in the process of putting in a new supply (resistance). \n\nSpy Daily is also in extreme bull momentum while the weekly has bullish momentum but it is not extreme. \n\nOn the weekly time frame one should expect a continuation upside with a ultimate target of 427.53 until we put in a new supply (resistance) at between here and 427.53. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5egghy0j6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1ddd0243bce493cc739aea7a90801c8e3c7a339\n\nNow as you can see we have a black bull channel that we have been trading in since basically the day after the March FOMC meeting. This channel gives us a Monday support at 407.7 and resistance at 418.5 (don\u2019t expect that just meaning the upside potential is the greatest). We also have 6 days of not backtesting the daily 8ema have officially backtested and bounced off the daily 8ema. This should allow for once again further upside momentum. \n\nNow I would have liked to see a more official back test of 405.2 support, however, one could infer the last two days to be a test of that 405-406 support area and that should once again provide upside lift. \n\nNow that the bulls have had a relief sell off there potential for the upside increases. Realistically it is unwise to bet against the upside here as long as we are holding the daily 8ema and holding 405.2 support. Ultimately the bulls target should be 419.5.\n\nNow while I am bullish there is something we need to talk about on the daily and that is the fact that we have three GAPS left at 396.49 to 398.68, 401.6 to 401.76 and 404.35 to 404.55. Now while a 10-15 cent gap alone could be negligible enough to never be filled a almost $2 gap most certainly will at some point need to be fill\u2026 That with the fact on SPY we have a supply at 399.07 and on futures we have supplies at 4015, 4040 and 4055 that NEED to be \u201ctake out\u201d to balance the market there is very little doubt in my mind that any upside potential we have on SPY/ futures is temporary. \n\nWhat I mean by this is that yes I am BULLISH and I even think CPI could propel us to the 420-430 area leading into FOMC if we get good enough data (as I believe the pause/ pivot narrative will likely escalate again) the markets left a huge imbalance (for lack of a better way to explain it) in the 393 to 399 area that at some point will need to be corrected before we can not only move higher but sustain higher lows. This has been a fairly common theme on SPY for the last year that from a technical stand point we get huge moves and breakouts but we leave such imbalances below that we HAVE to at some point \u201cfix\u201d the price action below before we can continue higher and sustain higher. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACITON**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1rfx10hj6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=79662089b476a5fd1ec19fbb6ec00169274e9c8f\n\nSPY weekly finds itself sitting in a massive year long breakout/ breakdown triangle currently as you can see by the black lines. This means that IF and when we break this triangle we very well could see a pretty explosive move one away or another. \n\nCurrently resistance for next week sits at 412.5 and support at 386.9. Now one thing that is interesting to me here is that we have been in a 4 week long red bull channel, however, after last weeks pretty impressive move up we actually closed out a 409.23 weekly double top with a doji reversal candle. Weekly support lies at 407.1 and resistance at 423.3. \n\nWhy does a weekly doji candle matter? Well if you look at every single weekly hard stop/ top then you will see they all are some form of a doji candle. This very well could turn into a weekly double top/ doji bearish reversal. \n\nHowever, if we break through that 412.5 resistance and breakout of this triangle then there is a chance that we could see a bigger push to retest the resistance of the august highs near 427.25. \n\nSPY Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 4010 -> 427.5  \n Demand- 385.9  \n Support- 407.3 -> 404 -> 398.1  \n Resistance- 409.3 -> 412.7 -> 417.1\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r7ct5exj6hsa1.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d42503afe7225e6ff88da9a49bd0508058eeb1f\n\nSPY and Futures have a pretty strong correlation right now in their technicals and price action similar set up here that we are seeing a pretty nice a hard rejection at 4154-4160 that led to the daily 8ema retest and support bounce with the current extreme bull momentum that we are in. \n\nNow while we are looking to establish a new demand (support) the one thing that I have as a possible concern here on futures is that double supply (resistance) set at 4154 to 4160. This level could provide a pretty impressive rejection if we do not have the proper support and momentum to take us higher. However, if bulls can break through that then we are likely to see a new demand (support) established near 4113 and put in an upside resistance test at 4198. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0li5jck6hsa1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=71d30462b6ea1904c429aa7490571d62c871ca21\n\nWeekly here very similar to spy weekly in that we just can not seem for the 3rd week in a row now to be able to close over that 4149 weekly supply (resistance) that was established back in January. This level likely is to provide heavy resistance and bulls are 100% going to need a close over that level if they have any sort of hope for a push to the next supply which is a very generous target of 4284. \n\nHowever, if we find ourselves once again under the 4149 weekly supply at close Friday we very well could reconfirm this level as a supply (resistance) which could lead to a retest of 4054 if not 3918. However, once again favortism remains to the upside and I still find it unwise to be against the current upside momentum. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kzhi93yk6hsa1.png?width=841&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf550c596020210e73b03f0d26adfb5026c337e1\n\nFutures also continues to be in a black bull channel for the last 2 weeks (since FOMC). With the pretty impressive breakout followed by a retest of the daily 8ema the last two weeks the favortism definitely goes to the upside here. However, as you can see we have a pretty impressive 4153 double top that we are going to need to break through first. IF and when we break through that 4153 resistance my target would still be the February high of 4193. \n\nWhile we did not test 405.2 support on SPY we did bounce off (within 1 point) of 4095 daily support on futures. This support bounce along with the daily 8ema bounce should be seen as a pretty important support bounce and confirmation of the up trend. \n\nI much like SPY would highly caution anyone from shorting SPY in its current uptrend and momentum. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uprh9zcl6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f5605069c9261e6a5ad1cd1da85e1e64d7fea51\n\nFutures has found itself in the same exact breakout/ down triangle that SPY has been in for the last year now. This triangle has a resistance at 4158 and support at 3900. Now the one interesting thing here (mostly because futures is trading while spy is not) is that it did break its 4 week long black bull channel. \n\nWith that support being broken and as of now a rejection at the 4138-4148 level we very well could be looking at a weekly top here. \n\nOne thing I want to factor in here is the JPM collar. We currently have the call side at 4300 (remember these are sold calls) and puts at 3860. Now historically speaking over the last about 2 years of trading we have always come within 100pts of the sold JPM calls or broken over then. That does mean over the next 3 months we very well could expect to see a push to 4200-4300 on futures. \n\nHowever, one other factor I would really like to highlight is the 7 week trend. This trend assumes that the 7 weeks post JPM collar roll generally is a trend followed by weeks 8 to 11 being a reversal. \n\nSo for instance we should see either a push or drop from now until the week of May 15th followed by a reversal. So lets assume we go on a nice 7 week long bull run (again) that means we could target that 4300 sold calls area over the next 7 weeks and then from May 15th to June 12th we are likely to see a pretty sizeable pullback. \n\nHowever, IF much like some of the technicals are slightly hinting at we see a 7 week drop leading into May 15th with a potential target of 3860 then we could from May 15th to June 12th see a recovery. \n\nFutures Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 4054 -> 4149 -> 4284  \n Demand- 3919  \n Support- 4095 -> 4077 -> 4008  \n Resistance- 4149 -> 4222\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p9rktnul6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=60d1aeec9276f68cb977e4d82465e5738cea572c\n\nNow looking at the VIX here this is where in my opinion things get a little interesting and shows that we could go either way. \n\nWhile from a realistic stand point I see very few reasons to bet against the bullishness of this market (at least until a new macro event happens\u2026 que the credit event\u2026) the VIX does tell a slighty different story than that of the markets. \n\nNow if we take a look at every \u201ctop\u201d of SPY daily over the last few months the \u201cbottom\u201d of the VIX was put in at 18.01, 17.06, 18.11, and 18.16. that means on average the \u201cbottom\u201d of the VIX was seen at an average of 17.84. with 18.01 to 18.16 being the biggest bounce area to watch. \n\nThe VIX closed Friday at 18.39 which is nearing that key pivot point of the 17s on the VIX. \n\nThe VIX in my opinion is saying the next temporary top on SPY is much closer than the next bottom is. However, the one thing I have learned once again over the last month on the VIX is that unless we have sustained (meaning back to back to back) bad news or more importantly unless the markets have continued reasons to sell off any sort of dip is likely to be bought back up very quickly and the VIX is very likely to sell off very quickly too. \n\nOne thing I have said all year on the on the markets is that \u201cmarkets NEED a reason to not only sell off but to CONTINUE to sell off\u2026\u201d Take a look at the bank run\u2026 markets went into a huge panic and dump impressively for a few days and then what happened? The feds/ government \u201csmoothed\u201d it over and boom all of a sudden no worries, no panic nothing and we rocketed once again\u2026 I mean jeeze take a look at the last FOMC\u2026 JPOW himself said \u201cwe will NOT cut rates this year\u2026 that is NOT our base case.\u201d And what did the markets do? They said I hear you JPOW but we are going to go ahead and price in another rate cut just because we don\u2019t believe you that much. \n\nWe are in a place right now where the markets being forward looking do not believe the fed and we have once again found ourselves in a time of good news is good and bad news is good too. \n\nThis is a very tough time to be a bear but despite a potential run on SPY to 420 and futures to 4200-4284 I do still think that our upside is limited enough where its best to trade this intraday. If and when we finally hit 415+ again I think some 4-6 month out puts could be a golden ticket play though. \n\n**DAILY/ WEEKLY TRADING LOGS**\n\nSince I wasn\u2019t able to post to reddit the last week or so im going to include my whole week of daily logs and then my usually weekly summary. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/th2czkem6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c38d4e8d68a6191dff8c7e4a62c5ce6058fa4ced\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p1xdm2zm6hsa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b1aa290331223fef8d7f6c7474af0e36b0c0a5e\n\nOverall a very small profit week. I went into this week expecting 405.2 to be hard resistance and that we would end up back near 393-395 by the EOW. However, I quickly realized I was 100% on the wrong side of things once we hard broke 405.2. I was able to average down on my long puts and take a more manageable -19.1% loss. The most frustrating thing about those puts was the way they moved. Now granted I was pretty far OTM it just seemed like a 10 cent move away from me was devastating while a $1 move in my direction barely did anything to recover my profits. \n\nOutside of that I was able to make quite a few nice scalps this week and my level to level trading was pretty solid. The biggest issue of this week once again was lack of continuation. The theme this week appeared to be a push/ move one way followed by 2-3 hours of untradeable chop/ lack of continuation followed by EOD rallies once again. I consistently seemed to have great mornings and then would find myself giving it all back in that mid day chop. \n\nFrom a technical stand point we had every single sign of a great setup to trade I mean like 100% of my confirmation I wanted for a trade only to end up with a move in the direction of expectation and then an even bigger irrational move against me. \n\nThe one thing I noticed the last 2-3 weeks is that I have taken far more trades then usual and my win rate has been lower but I remain profitable. This mostly in my opinion is related to trusting my trading system and entries and taking all the high probability setups that I see. However, I am also cutting my losers must faster than ever before.
