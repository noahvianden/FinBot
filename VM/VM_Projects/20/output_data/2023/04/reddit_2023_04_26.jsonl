That is a much more common action for brokerages to take.

When a long is exercised, a short is chosen at random for assignment.  So if you exercise a long option, there isn't a particular person out there who was destined to be assigned.  Who gets assigned is chosen at that time.  And if you have a short option, you don't get assigned if and only if some specific person you sold \"your\" option to exercises.  You get assigned if some random long out there exercises and you happen to be the one who gets chosen for assignment.\n\n(P.S.: Why do some people write \"PUT\" and \"CALL\" in all-caps?

One important piece of information from Pepsico earnings call is that there will be no more price increases (most likely) for the rest of the year (good for disinflation). \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k05n0dhfc4wa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=10e23373faa84f86e5c340da9a522c141f8e489d\n\nGM beat earnings estimates and guided higher. This is a bit surprising, especially considering that Whirlpool also beat expectations. In fact, the whole consumer discretionary sector was doing very well in Q1.

However, they are now anticipating a recession as revenue per single order dropped and price resistance from dinners increased.\n\nVisa confirmed that consumer spending is still very strong, with a 10% growth in payment volume.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvella8yc4wa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=8229ad3fd9a4833efca4da665327d012f6eaa38a\n\n And I was right yesterday about the massive short position.

Thoughts?", "selftext": "I've stumbled upon something that caught my attention and wanted to get your thoughts on it.\n\nI recently saw a Fruity Pebbles branded protein powder (ISO100) in Walmart, and it got me thinking \u2013 who tf thought mixing an unhealthy kids' cereal brand for a fitness/health-conscious consumer was a good idea? I couldn't help but be skeptical about the potential success of this product. \n\nThis led me to wonder if this decision was due to any combination of a lack of oversight, excessive bloat, or just poorly vetted data within the company. The Flintstones characters (used by Fruity Pebbles) are owned by Warner Bros., while the protein powder is under Post Holdings. I imagine the licensing deal must have been a nightmare, and expensive. \n\nDigging deeper into Post Holdings (POST), I found that their short-term assets ($2.2B) don't cover their long-term liabilities ($6.8B), and they have a debt to equity ratio of 142.1%. Additionally, their debt isn't well-covered by their operating cash flow of 6.8%. Recent news about their activity seems to suggest that they're not shy about acquiring more debt.\n\nPost's SPAC vehicle, PSPC, reportedly has negative shareholder equity. This makes me question if POST might be a good short opportunity.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think POST's management is making questionable decisions, or am I just overreacting to the Fruity Pebbles protein powder? Any advice or recommendations based on this info would be greatly appreciated. \n\nPosition: Considering if/when I shouuld short POST.", "id": "12zpx4o", "created_utc": 1682527512.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: I recently saw a Fruity Pebbles branded protein powder (ISO100) in Walmart, which made me skeptical about the company's decision-making.

{"title": "Market Recap - 4/26/23 - A song of ice and fire", "selftext": "Been running around all day. This is going to be a short one.\n\n**The Economy**\n\nTLDR, more mixed signals from durable goods data suggest a slowing economy, in line with other data this week.\n\nUS Commerce March Durable Goods Orders increased by 3.2%, exceeding the consensus estimate of 0.5%. \n\nThis surprise beat was almost completely due to Boeing's big order form Air India (Nondefense aircraft new orders increased by 78.4%).\n\nCapital goods orders, nondefense, excluding aircraft (represented by the blue line) actually decreased 0.4% month-over-month, vs. estimated 0.1% decrease. Shipments, nondefense, excluding aircraft (represented by the orange line), decreased by 0.4% compared to the estimated increase of 0.1%.\n\nThe AtlantaFed revised its Q1 GDP forecast to 1.1%, down from 2.5% the previous week, just one day before the GDP release.  Have they all gone vaca for the past 3 weeks? Tomorrow's GDP report is not going to look pretty.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ao69s14acbwa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d33ebee35465bcb27ea04538006b685834ce823\n\n**The Business**\n\nTLDR, service sector is still strong, but goods are probably dead; while mega caps are beating estimations and about to make new highs (not quite yet), micro caps just made a new low. A song of ice and fire.\n\nHilton beat both the top and bottom line and raised its full-year guidance, indicating strong consumer spending on travel services. Visa reported similar findings, noting that ticket sizes were declining as inflation moderates, but growth remains strong in services, travel, and entertainment. Outbound travel from the US to all geographies remained strong at around 150% of 2019 levels, indicating that the consumer is still in good shape.\n\nWhile the service sector seems to be still strong, transportation (indicator for goods orders) has been leading the decline. Dow Jones transportation index dropped 1000 points in 2 days. Who needs stuff when you can go places and snap some pics for the gram?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t02j5ckccbwa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2fc274cbe57ecc93bfb78555cbb47a712cb5778\n\nMeta beat both top and bottom line and lifted guidance. My personal take on earnings is that growth is very limited down the road. MAU barely moved while ARPU declined, and more importantly, operating margins were down significantly (31% to 25%) yoy, highlighting challenges from both competition and economic uncertainty. Reality Lab should be shut down completely, as it\u2019s still struggling for direction after years of exploration. Finding new revenue is a must for Meta; it might as well completely pivot to AI. \n\nSame situation here for mega cap vs micro cap. As I mentioned in my weekend post, Large Growth is going to be the winning investment style this year as we face more economic uncertainty and a tightening credit market. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0469du4dcbwa1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5b046369adeea944daed09b278b68eb52f8dcfa\n\nMy positions have not changed from yesterday.", "id": "1303hzk", "created_utc": 1682552468.0, "score": 93, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|125|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12mbzxi/market_recap_41423_banks_earnings_so_strong_both/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12q04j8/market_recap_41723_everyone_is_bearish_but_stonks/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12ixw7g/market_recap_4112023_analysts_lowering_sp500/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12nn4uj/week_ended_april_14_recap_and_thoughts_for_next/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12jyjoh/market_recap_4122023_cpi_slightly_lower_than/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12woh5b/week_ended_april_21_recap_and_thoughts_for_next/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12l8988/market_recap_4132023_ppi_lower_than_expected/) \n**Account Age**|2 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Slowdown economy, service sector is still strong, goods are probably dead; mega caps are beating estimations and about to make new highs (not quite yet), micro caps just made a new low.
