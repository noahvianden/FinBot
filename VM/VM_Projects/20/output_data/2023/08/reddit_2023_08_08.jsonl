It core trading, you apply the principles of technical trading to long term holdings.\n\nThe valuation of a company is much harder to assertain than seeing a trendline break on a chart. Plus since the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. Even if you were to be correct on the low valuation of a company and also be right on the correct price the stock should be. You might still not make bank.\n\nI was getting burned by my swing trading recently, despite the great profit, it's a lot of work, then accounting, etc. So I was interested in starting value investing. To have a long term holding place to put my recent gains to compound them for later.\nI read multiple books on value investing, they talk extensively about EPS, net revenue, assets, debt, how to read a financial report, etc.\n\nWhat became apparent reading \"Margin of safety: risk-averse value investing strategies for the thoughtful investor\" by Seth A Klarman (a book that W. Buffet has in his office and supposedly purchased a copy for 13k$ claiming it was worth every penny). Is that all those EPS, EBIT, EBITDA, dept, revenue, etc are all horseshit. They work the same way technical indicators do. For a while people only cared about EPS, then someone invents a new ratio and claims its so much better than the other and anyone not using it is missing out. So people start using it, meaning that everyone buys the same stocks (the one that have a good score under that new ratio) which then becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Just like technical indicators when everyone started using bollinger bands in 2010-15,... \n\nThat was the first book to mention this. Which I thought was very accurate and logical. I highly recommend the book. But then the author goes on how these indicators aren't really great, and none show you the companies that are really undervalued. He goes on to explain how to work that out without those well known and biased ratios, but then warns that even if really undervalued it might still not start to climb just because you bought it. That actually the best is to find a value that has assets - debts that are much higher than it's valuation, then purchase the company and liquidate all of its assets (which is something Buffet did do in the past, but sadly requires to already have enough to purchase an entire company, which I don't).\n\nTL;DR: It became clear after reading this book, which is probably one of the best on value investing, that value investing is no better than throwing chicken bones in the air, and requires a good deal of luck even when you correctly identified a massively undervalued company. \n\nYou might be stuck in a position for years without making much profit. After years of not doing much you might start to think you're money would be better off in AAPL or SPY, but you can't sell because nobody wants that crapy company you bought so you're stuck on an illiquid position. If you're unlucky you'll sell after 5 years for a meager 10% gain, and then see the stock do +200% 2 months later, turns out you were right, too sad you just sold. Even if you did stay in long enough to see it boom, when do you sell? When you made a 100%? What if it goes to +500% next? What if you wait for +500 but ut it never comes, went to +201% then dropped all the way back down to +20 before you got time to sell because those are long term holdings, you're not watching them every day and it just so happen to have pumped and dumped in the 2 weeks per year where you're on holiday on the other side of the world with poor internet?\n\nAll in all I prefer trading. I have a known batting average on my technical pattern, and despite being under 50% win rate, with proper money management I still turn it into a 30-40% profit per year before tax, sadly my country has a per transaction tax (i'm also taxed on loosing trades) so in the end I'm left with 12-15% when I don't get stopped out too much (same strategy in another country would be much more profitable). But I'm still very happy with 12%. Maybe value investing can give better results, but I feel I don't have enough control over it.
