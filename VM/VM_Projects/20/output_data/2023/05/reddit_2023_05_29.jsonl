This is rooted in a small bit of causation. As a brief overview,  the yield curve has time on the x axis and bond yield on the Y axis, as a reminder bonds pay a coupon and not a fixed interest rate. Generally, a bond with a long maturity has greater risk to the bond purchaser than a bond with a short maturity, as such long maturity bonds traditionally offer a higher annual coupon, and as such the yield (coupon/bond price) is also higher. \n\nWhen the curve inverts, that means long maturity bonds have high purchase demand, and so the bond price increases, which lowers the yield. Inversion happens when the yields lower so much that they are less than the short-term bond yields. As a reminder, the bond market is about triple the size of the equity markets. So why is everyone willing to take a lower yield on a riskier asset? Well, because the bond market believes that interest rates will fall and so believe they won't be able to renew bonds at the same interest rate if they were to buy short-term bonds.\n\nWhy does the interest rate go down? Traditionally, because the fed needs to spur economic growth in order to mitigate or recover from a recession. Remember, this prediction mechanism is still predicated on the \"guess\" that the bond market is making on future interest rates. Moreover, there are other reasons aside from a recession to lower interest rates. For example, right now, rates were increased to ease inflation. If inflation decreases without causing a recession, then rates will slowly be lowered, and thus, the inversion metric was a false positive. \n\nAs you can see, there is more merit in something like a yield inversion. So all these data points you see touted aren't equally as worthless, though as you've seen in this overview yield inversion is less worthless, though that doesn't make it good.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I have no idea what that means but it looks smart so take my upvote", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.014979677274823189}], "tickers": ["recession", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "My astrologist said it's very real.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "My Psychic says, \"Be careful when things recede\"", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Mine told me to always recede before arriving.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.47858577966690063}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.50323486328125}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5395511388778687}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09142398834228516}, {"body": "Yes it will definitely go down.
