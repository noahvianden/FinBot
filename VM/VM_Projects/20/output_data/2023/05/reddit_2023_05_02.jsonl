Like capital markets, underwriting, etc although there is a big chill on all financials hence the layoffs.\n\nWithout looking too deep into this, my \"guess\" is JPMorgan is buying FRC's client list and exposure to the west coast. Here in California, the main bank people use is Bank of America, then Wells Fargo. Chase (which is owned by JP Morgan) is more common in the Midwest (Chicago) and east coast vs BOA. Chase is starting to get more frequent here but California isn't their main area so exposure makes sense.\n\nFRC had also mainly wealthy clients. Several of their locations are in wealthy areas here in Southern California so possibly getting access to those clients makes sense, however; based on withdrawal numbers, many of them may have already left.\n\nThe downside is JP Morgan has to put all FRC's liabilities on their books now which probably isn't the end of the world. There was absolutely no reason for JP Morgan to buy out FRC when it was clearly blowing up. \n\nThis reminds me of BoA who bought Merrill Lynch in 2008.

The goal is to profit from the time decay of the short-term put option while holding a long-term put option as insurance against potential price declines.\n\nThe investor is essentially betting that the stock price will remain relatively stable or increase in the short-term, allowing them to collect premiums from selling the near-term put option.

{"title": "Your lotto play for AMD's earnings tonight", "selftext": "Is it time already for another *earnings post?* Last week was killer, let's see about this week. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is set to release its first-quarter 2023 results today, after-hours. In recent weeks, analysts have lowered expectations, and AMD probably has a low bar to clear for this quarter. \n\nAMD's recent quarterly reports have been sub-par, with the company (and the semiconductor industry in general) grappling with supply issues. With the [economy seemingly headed toward a hard landing](https://i.imgur.com/HfuYkKH.png), AMD's financial performance has probably not bottomed yet for this semiconductor cycle.\n\nSo far in 2023, AMD's stock has rallied big time; however, we need to take a closer look at the company before joining the AMD bandwagon ahead of its Q1 report. In today's post, we will preview AMD's upcoming report and evaluate the stock to see if calls or puts will be the play specifically for earnings today. \n\n**What Is The Earnings Forecast For AMD?**\n\nIn their [Q4 2022 earning press release](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1115/amd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2022-financial), their management guided for Q1 2023 revenues to be in the range of $5-$5.6B, and this guide fell short of consensus analyst estimates of $5.6B. Furthermore, the guide for non-GAAP EPS also fell short of estimates. However, the market somehow reacted positively to AMD's ER, with the stock jumping up **+18%** in just two post-earning sessions as investors seemingly looked beyond the immediate results and guidance. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/XiocMkp.png\n\nWell, that's not all! AMD's management had some good news for investors. From the [Q1 earnings call transcript](https://i.imgur.com/T8vYUuE.png), you can see that AMD's management sees macro headwinds lasting through the first half of this year; however, they see the demand environment improving in the back half of 2023, with emerging technologies like AI set to drive greater demand for AMD's products for years to come. Now, AMD's management has a history of under-promising and over-delivering, and so, we may very well end up with better-than-expected results from Advanced Micro Devices in 2023.\n\nI believe that the long-term dynamics driving AMD's growth will continue for many more years. In this challenging macroeconomic environment, AMD is increasing market share across all of its business categories, even if its near-term financial performance is expected to remain under pressure. Unfortunately, in this environment, negative growth rates are unlikely to go unpunished, and AMD stock may continue to decline after its Q1 report, particularly if AMD fails to meet the revised consensus expectations.\n\nBefore we look into consensus analyst estimates for Q1 2023, let's briefly review AMD's Q4 2022 earnings report to understand ongoing business trends.\n\n**How Was AMD's Previous Earning Report?**\n\nIn Q4 2022, [Advanced Micro Devices' revenues](https://i.imgur.com/L0qAIWC.png) grew by 16% y/y to $5.6B, with growth in its Data Center and Embedded business segments being offset by Client and Gaming business lines. While AMD delivered a marginal beat on revenues, EPS fell short of expectations.\n\n* EPS Normalized Actual: $0.69 (Beat by $0.02)\n\n* EPS GAAP Actual: $0.01 (Miss by -$0.20)\n\n* Revenue Actual: $5.60B\n\n* Revenue Surprise: Beat by $82.93M\n\nAmid a sharp decline in global PC shipments, AMD has been under shipping in its Client business segment over recent quarters, which saw a 51% y/y drop in Q4 2022. For 2023, AMD is planning for the PC total addressable market (\"TAM\") to be down ~10% for 2023, with the second half of the year expected to be far better than the first half. [According to IDC](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS50565723), global PC shipments fell by 29% y/y, with shipments being hurt by weak demand, excess inventory, and deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. Its Client and Gaming segment revenues also declined y/y due to the current demand environment.\n\nNow, despite AMD's business becoming data center centric over the last few quarters, AMD's growth outlook remains challenging until the global PC market weakness persists. As economic strength wanes, AMD's Gaming business has also come under pressure in recent quarters, and this trend continued in Q4 2022. For 2023, AMD's management expects Client and Gaming segment revenue to decline for the full year 2023 due to lower demand.\n\nMore alarmingly, AMD's management has expressed caution on the Data Center segment for H1 2023 due to some of its major cloud customers having high levels of inventories. Revenues from the data canter segment, which had been a major growth engine for AMD during 2022, increased 42% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2022. AMD's Embedded business section is expanding significantly along with its Data Centre business segment; however, this expansion is due to [AMD's strategic acquisition of Xilinx](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davealtavilla/2022/02/14/amd-completes-xilinx-acquisition-and-the-obvious-synergies-spell-great-potential/). I'll be keeping a close eye on the Embedded segment in the upcoming quarters to understand the real trajectory of this business.\n\nFor the last several years, AMD has been winning market share across its various end markets. And AMD is continually adding new and improved products across its segments, which means that the market share gains are likely to continue in the coming years. Among these innovations are AMD's Ryzen 7040 CPU Series, Ryzen 7045 CPU Series, and Radeon RX 7900 series graphics cards. The new graphics cards built for gaming laptops, providing 26% higher performance on average than previous generation Raedon graphics. AMD also announced the availability of three new Ryzen processors adding to the portfolio of high-performance PC products for desktops and mobiles in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\nOn top of a sharp revenue growth deceleration, AMD's financial performance is suffering under the weight of margin compression. With a supply glut forcing inventory write-offs among semiconductor companies in recent quarters, AMD's margins have tumbled lower. In Q4, AMD's non-GAAP operating margins came in at 23% (down 400 bps y/y). [Here's a graph on their operating margins](https://i.imgur.com/ZgRoFDZ.png) in each segment over the last 5 quarters. \n\nThe company attributed the fall in the Client segment's margin to lower revenue. However, the decline in Data Center margins was attributed to additional R&D and go-to-market investments to support the next phase of AMD's revenue growth. In upcoming quarters, I'd like to see an improvement in AMD's margin profile; however, things are unlikely to get better until the macroeconomic environment eases off.\n\n**Is AMD Expected To Beat Earnings?**\n\nAccording to consensus analyst estimates, AMD is set to deliver total revenue of $5.31B for Q1 2023, and the range of these estimates is from $5.25B to $5.50B (higher end of management's guidance for this quarter).\n\n* EPS Normalized Actual: $0.56\n\n* EPS GAAP Actual: $0.02\n\n* Revenue Actual: $5.31B\n\nOver the last three months, AMD has received 24 downward revisions for Q1 2023 revenue as analysts scamper to adjust to management's lowered guidance. As of today, the consensus analyst estimate for AMD's Q1 revenue sits at $5.31B (in line with the midpoint of management's guidance range).\n\nThe consensus outlook for AMD's revenue has been trending in the wrong direction over the last couple of quarters or so; however, the earnings outlook is getting markedly worse. That said, AMD is already a cash-generating machine, and with scale, profitability is only going to get better in the future. Based on recent business trends, management's guidance, and earning revisions, I think AMD is not likely to deliver a beat on consensus expectations. And even if we do get a beat from AMD, the quantum of the beat may be minimal, and I am currently working with a Q1 2023 revenue projection of $5.3B (midpoint of management's guidance).\n\n**How are the Technicals?** \n\nAMD's chart looks far better than it did six months ago; however, the stock seems to be forming [a rising wedge pattern](https://i.imgur.com/z5l6y4E.png), and a breakdown to the $72-80 range is likely, given the rollover in RSI, MACD, and trading volumes.\n\nWhile AMD's stock has continued to climb up in recent months, its earning estimates have been shifting lower. Interestingly, there are no \"Sell\" ratings from Wall Street firms on AMD at this time. Yet, the upside potential that analysts are predicting from here isn't huge. With a consensus analyst price target of $97.72, Wall Street sees an upside potential of just ~10% in AMD.\n\n**So what to do for Earnings?**\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. remains a fundamentally sound business, and going into the Q1 2023 report, I continue to like it as a long-term investment. But for earnings, there seems to be a mixed bag of good news and bad news - making it difficult to predict whether the stock will go up or down tonight. An AMD calls spread looks good, grabbing the 5/5 95c for $139 and selling the 100c for $55 (at the time of writing this). This means you can get the spread for $84, this could offer 6x gains if AMD goes up ~11%. Keep in mind, with earnings you can never predict things with certainty. Just for fun, yesterday [I made a comment saying that UBER was going to go up +10% today](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/134zl7z/what_are_your_moves_tomorrow_may_02_2023/jiisc09/?context=3) with earnings and it did.
