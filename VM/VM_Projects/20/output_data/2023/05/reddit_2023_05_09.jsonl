{"title": "Probably the dumbest Earning Play to date: Let's tackle RIVN", "selftext": "This is probably going to be my most degen post to date. Just read every other word to save braincells. By god, Rivian (RIVN) is going to be announcing Q1 earnings results on today, May 9th, after market close. The consensus EPS Estimate is -$1.58 (+61.5% year-over-year) and the consensus Revenue Estimate is $661.97M (+596.8% year-over-year) vs. a pathetic $95M a year ago.\n\n**Earnings history**\n\nIn 4Q22, the company saw [mixed results](https://www.wsj.com/articles/rivian-rivn-q4-earnings-report-2022-2cd0e80e), with a negative gross margin forecast for 2023. In 2024, the company anticipates a positive gross profit. Last month, [the company reported](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ev-maker-rivian-beats-quarterly-delivery-estimates) deliveries of 7,946 vehicles in Q1 to top the consensus estimate of 7,752 and production of 9,395 vehicles at its Normal, Illinois plant during the quarter vs. 8,752 consensus.\n\nThe company said it is on track to produce 50K vehicles in 2023 with production starting to ramp up. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 4 upward revisions and 3 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 0 upward revisions and *8 downward.*\n\n**Analysts ratings**\n\n[Piper Sandler](https://www.pipersandler.com/) analyst [Alexander Potter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-potter-1ab391137/) downgraded Rivian Automotive to Neutral from Overweight with a price target of $15, down from $63 citing funding concerns. Mr. Potter explained that the company's current strategy requires lots of funding that may discourage investors in the current macro environment. He estimates that RIVN will need to raise over $4B to fund long-term growth beyond 2025.\n\nRBC Capital analyst [Tom Narayan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tom-narayan-4567b812/?originalSubdomain=uk) downgraded the company from Outperform to Sector Perform, with a $14 price target, down from $28. While the firm believes Rivian is \"well positioned to capture market share as the industry shifts towards electrification,\" it sees few catalysts to increase profitability in the short term and believes the company's margins will \"remain constrained.\"\n\nMorgan Stanley lowered the price target to $24 from $26 and maintains an Overweight rating. Rivian investor confidence has been poor following a 2022 \"plagued by ramp delays, macro headwinds, and an ensuing EV price war.\" They said that after adjusting its model, the firm's \"bull case\" objective drops to $45 from $55 and its base case target drops to $24.\n\n**What to do for Earnings?**\n\nWow these are a lot of bearish sentiment, so puts for earnings? Consider the price targets tho and Rivian's current price of $14. So am I getting calls? Oh man. Decisions. The key question is whether Rivian\u2019s 2023 production guidance of 50,000 units is achievable.  Consider the economic uncertainty, expenses, and a struggling EV industry. Even Tesla is down massively from it's recent highs of 180s. At this year\u2019s low, RIVN stock was down 36% for 2023. However, the recent gains have cut those losses to \u201cjust\u201d 26.4%. Welp, time to go balls to the walls. Full send, on 5/12 13p @ 0.59. Can make this a put spread to spend even less money, buying the 12p cuts the price in half, can get the spread for only 29 bucks. This means potentially 3.4x profit if RIVN crashes 14% with earnings. But bare in mind, as with all my other posts, these are entirely meant to just educate people about what we tend to look for when making an earning prediction. It by no means can be considered financial or investment advice.", "id": "13d1740", "created_utc": 1683655709.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|3 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|153|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12zph3r/your_lotto_play_for_metas_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13byuhu/what_im_doing_for_pltr_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/137wdc6/how_to_play_tonights_aapl_earnings_safely/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13bzvbn/why_im_getting_pypl_calls_for_earnings/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/135v8qm/your_lotto_play_for_amds_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12ytt9u/why_im_getting_msft_calls_for_earnings/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/136t8is/your_lotto_play_for_etsys_earnings_tonight/) \n**Account Age**|4 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Rivian is going to announce earnings tomorrow, analysts are bearish, I'm bullish.
