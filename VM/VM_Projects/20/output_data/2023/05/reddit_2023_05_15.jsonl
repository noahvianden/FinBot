With that it could be an indication that we are going to push to the upside. However, if you look at the daily price action you can see we are clearly still in a range and realistically what most probably is going to happen is we continue to push these support/ resistance lines out until we finally see a sustainable breakout or breakdown. \n\nWe are attempting and realistically establishing 411.6 as a major support area now. The major resistance still lies in that 413.4 to 414.7 area though. \n\nAs long as SPY continues to close candles over the daily 8ema I am neutral to bullish\u2026 as I said last week I do believe it is still too early to short\u2026\n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 411.1 -> 415.6  \n Demand- 411.6 -> 405  \n Support- 411.6 -> 408.8  \n Resistance- 413.5 -> 414.7 -> 415.9\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eefi3pa6i20b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=13d880a12758e5db90bf9eb9640f3eaab2ac6b23\n\nFutures and SPY are now back on track together with Futes also putting in a new demand (Support). With todays new demand at 4131 it actually lowers the current demand from 4134 (takes it out) to the current 4131. \n\nSupport being established at 4131 means we start to look at the next supply (resistance) which sits at 4153 then 4190. If you remember from Friday that supply was re-confirmed (hence the dashed line instead of normal solid) which means we should look at 4153 as a major resistance area. \n\nIt is probable that we do reject here but also the biggest thing to note is that the last 7 candles have no closed within this 4131 to 4153 range\u2026 \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uoszv3r6i20b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0a73370c5e1f27bd2d8a937fb30938055d79219\n\nPrice action wise with this really nice double bottom off 4131 and establishing a new demand (support) I would definitely look for the upside here.. it should be noted that we still have not broken through that blue resistance line which has 4 touches on it\u2026 that resistance sits at 4155 for tomorrow and that is what we will call our line in our sand\u2026\n\nA wick through 4155 but more importantly a closure OVER 4153 tomorrow would indicate the potential for a bigger move up to that 4190 to 4198 area. \n\nHowever, if we truly are range bound there actually is a high probability that we reject tomorrow with a double top off 4150 and close somewhere near 4130-4135. IF this happens we actually are likely to see a new supply (resistance) established below 4153. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4153 -> 4190  \n Demand- 4131 -> 4074  \n Support- 4131 -> 4110  \n Resistance- 4153 -> 4180\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gpw54f87i20b1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab849cbccc9d88ab72d1f64877e911351ba106bd\n\nInterestingly enough\u2026 the VIX actually closed green today AND SPY closed green\u2026 actually even more interestingly is that the VIX closed a 0.29%+ and futures closed at exactly 0.29%+\u2026 I actually do not know if I have ever seen that happen before\u2026\n\nThe VIX this morning was up about 3-4% before it finally started to sell off\u2026 it attempted to break through that 17.72 resistance level, however, once again failed and ended up coming back to that key 17.1 support area. \n\nThe VIX continues to be sandwiched in that 16.79 to 17.72 area with the mean reversion being to 17.1 area. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dsj31r88i20b1.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=686882c81649d2d2d43c580656766b64f40e039c\n\nReally couldn\u2019t have asked for a better way to start the week off\u2026 pulled in 75% of my weekly goal today. \n\nWhile these extremely tight ranges\u2026 where spy closes within a 30-50 cent range for 2 hours or more\u2026 are extremely annoying and I would much rather play a bigger range, I have truly finally been able to capitalize on these movements. \n\nThe one thing that I will always love about SPY is that it is predictable, chartable, and tradeable in all conditions\u2026 2022 challenged me to be a better trader and to adapt to the ever changing market and volatility\u2026 so far in 2023 we are now learning how to be better range traders\u2026 2022 and 2023 have been learning experiences that any of us who survive will use as tools to be better traders and prosper for the rest of our trading careers.", "id": "13im0tf", "created_utc": 1684188049.0, "score": 118, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|4949|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1144ms6/50_bps_hike_the_nail_in_the_bear_coffin_21623_spy/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/13d54bo/tomorrow_is_the_markets_dday_cpi_breakdown_and/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: SPY today was insanely boring with barely any movement\u2026 however, I was able to capitalize on the small movement and pull in 75% of my weekly goal.
