This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).\n    \n- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.\n\n- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.\n\n- **Expiration:** 2023-08-04.\n\n- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are \"cheaper.\" High numbers mean options are \"expensive.\"\n\n- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.\n\n- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.\n\n- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have \"weeklies\", the underlying is \"too cheap\", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.", "id": "15eiiuj", "created_utc": 1690815500.0, "score": 87, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "Still want to see last weeks results/recap included.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "It\u2019s coming!

Its not about investing in stuff you use or see. Its about knowing their business and sector. Thats what they meant. So what do you know about Intel's business? Where do they make the bulk of their money? Do you keep up with their sector and its competitors? What do you think of their executives and board? What is a fair valuation for their business? This is what they meant by the word \"know.\"\n\n2 - Articles are fine but should never be trusted. They are only good for learning valuation processes and there are tons of them... the question is, what do you use and when? People have their own opinions about that as do the people writing articles, many of which, will be wrong. So beware. Learn from them but apply at your own discretion.\n\n3 - Similar to articles, podcasters and such shouldnt be trusted unless you know them personally and have vetted their historic performance for the last decade (at a minimum). If they dont have a publically available view of their portfolio and records for the last decade, DONT TRUST THEM (unless you know them personally and trust them that way). BTW the way to measure if someone is good is if they beat the S&P500 over the last decade. Those are good investors. If they just meet the S&P500 then they are no better than buying an index fund like VOO so dont bother listening to them. If they under performed a markey index then they shouldnt be advising anyone...\n\nOkay with that out of the way, re-evaluate your strategies.\n\nHere is what I do.\n\nA - I check macro indicators. Things like the PE of the S&P500. CPI trend. Interest rate trends. And the market moving average (200 day usually). Jobs. etc. I use these as a sort of baseline just to give me a feel for whats happening in a region be it the USA or anywhere else thats investment grade.\n\nB -  Fundamentals trump everything for me. I dont buy anything if it doesnt have a strong fundamental platform be it product, IP, service, or whatever. I also dont play with fantasy stocks that arent profitable and dont have a clear path to profitability in the near future. I leave the gambling to others.\n\nC - I check out random small and medium cap stocks every few months. I made most of my money here because I found them before most others noticed. I use stock screeners to find them and I use different criteria for different sectors. The key here, is you need to know the sectors... see #1 above. There are a lot of nice screeners out there, many are fantastic. Pick your favorite.\n\nD - If I cant find anything good, I build my anchor portfolio. This is essentially my hedge positions. Solid companies with long running success. Usually big or medium caps that have a long history of good bottom line and dividend growth. I also like REITs, historically, though not right now. Again reference sectors you know.\n\nE - If I cant find good anchor stocks, but macro is still good, then just index. I just buy VOO.\n\nF - When none of the above coalesce... cash... dont under estimate cash. Build your cash reserves and wait. Patience always wins be it with cash or your stocks. I cannot overstate how important patience is.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["intc", "cpi"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": []}
