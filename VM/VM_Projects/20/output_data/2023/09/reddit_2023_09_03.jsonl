I said the CC position is being created together for the purpose of a capital gains, as opposed to already owning the stock and deciding to sell a call against it.\n\nYou're right I misunderstood based on your wording. I realized at the end of my post you meant a buy-write but didn't go back to correct my first point.\n\nBut I think I understand better now you're overall strategy and concerns. My concern now would be how 'tight' your thesis actually is. $475 is only ~2% down which for NVDA which seem fairly common for it as of late. So you're entering a 10dte position but your \"stop loss\" is 2% away. Now, granted, even if NVDA opened down at $475 and IV took a small jump, you'd be out of the trade for probably a $600 net loss or so (based on quickly throwing the trade together on optionstrat) and a 3:10 R:R isn't shabby at all. Even a Monday gap down open of 3% would be a $1k loss. Just seems like a very binary trade and if that works for you then by all means but I'd much prefer a strategy with some room to breath.\n\nAs far as management goes per your original question: There's not really any management opportunity here. Since you don't want this to turn into an \"investment\" type trade, rolling somewhat defeats the purpose. It's certainly an option but on something like NVDA the price could move against you very quickly to the point where you can't sell calls above your basis any longer. You could roll down strikes as the two weeks progress towards your original DTE to lock in profit on the short call but that increases your breakeven and reduces max profit by a lot. The best option would probably be to just close out the trade for the loss based on the time-frame and tight window. I think in this instance though I'd just go for a different trade structure like a call debit spread which would also use far less buying power for the same max reward.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for taking the time to understand what I was getting at. \n\nIt\u2019s not that I downright do not want the trade to persist even through downside, it\u2019s that I want to understand how to manage downside movement.
