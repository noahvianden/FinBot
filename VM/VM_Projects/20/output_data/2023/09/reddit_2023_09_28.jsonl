{"title": "Critical Recession Update: Nearing the midpoint of the +/-1 Sigma Birthing Zone, the Cradle of Recessions (Key Takeaways Below)", "selftext": "Key Takeaways:\r\n\n\r\n1) \tWe have progressed one-quarter (1/4) of the way into the +/-1 Sigma zone, which is equivalent to approximately 2.34 months into the 9.22 month-long recession birthing zone.\r\n\n\r\n2)\t It has been 10 months since the yield curve inverted on November 28, 2022, specifically the 50-day SMA of the 10-year minus 3-month yield curve. Historically, at this point from past inversions, four out of the last eight recessions had already commenced. These four recession onsets took place within a 1.58 month timeframe in the early part of the +/-1 Sigma Zone.\r\n\n\r\n3) \tCurrently, there's a 31.81% chance that the next recession has started, and this probability is rapidly growing as time advances.\r\n\n\r\n4) \tStatistically, the most-likely start date of the next recession is the center point of the +/-1 Sigma Zone, which occurs early December 2023 (+/-4.61 months) and equates to a 50% probability that a recession will start on or before that date.\r\n\n\r\n5)\t There is a very high likelihood of 84% that a recession will start on or before we reach the end of the +/-1 Sigma zone, which will occur around late April 2024.\r\n\n\r\n6) \tSeven of the last eight recessions have started within the +/-1 Sigma birthing zone, which we entered back on July 20th, 2023.  The only recession that started outside of this zone did so less than 3 months above this zone.\r\n\n\r\n7)\t As we progress through the +/-1 Sigma birthing zone, a secular downturn in the overall U.S economy is extremely likely to manifest itself with rising unemployment rates and deteriorating corporate earnings (among many other economic metrics), which will begin to gain momentum as the negative feedback cycle spirals downwards (once a cycle begins, it tend to perpetuate itself).\r\n \n\r\n8)\t The 50-day SMA inversion has reversed its downward direction for the first time since the curve inverted 10 months ago - a conformational signal that we are leaving the late peak stage of the business cycle just prior to the beginning of the economic contraction phase (recession).\r\n\n\r\n9) \tAs predicted in the last two posts, there is a high probability that the stock market has already reached its peak (highest price point), which was estimated to occur around a late August to early September 2023 time frame.  This is predicted to be followed by a long-term secular stock market downtrend (an enduring drop in stock market prices across the board) lasting an average of 11.9 months (once a trend is established, it tends to persist).\r\n\n\r\n10)  The stock market is expected to hit a trough (its lowest price point), indicating a bottoming formation, sometime around late August 2024.  This is an opportunity for averaging (moving) back into equities.\r\n\n\r\nNote #1:  Most recessions usually start several months before they are eventually declared. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) typically doesn\u2019t declare recessions until well after they have begun.\r\n\n\r\nNote #2: Recessions are a natural part of the business cycle and create long-term health for the economy by clearing out marginal (zombie) businesses and allowing the reallocation of resources to new upstarts and the expansion of healthy businesses.\r\n\r\n\n\r\nExplanation of Top Diagram:\n\r\nOver the past +50 years, inversions of the 50 day Simple Moving Average (SMA) of the deltas between the 10 year and 3 month daily treasury yield curve rates have all preceded the start of a U.S. recession (there have been no false indicators or exceptions to this rule).  And no recessions have occurred in the absence of these 50 day SMA inversions.  The 8 recessions that occurred over the last half a century have started within an average of 12.18 months from the first day that their 50 day SMA inversions began.\r\n\n\r\nExplanation of Bottom Diagram:\n\r\nThis recession probability distribution illustrates the positions of the last eight recessions over a +50 year period.  These positions are superimposed on the probability curve with each recession's location based on the time from the first day of their corresponding 50 day SMA inversions (10 Yr. minus 3 Mo.) to the beginning of each recession.  The best-fit representation employs a normal distribution with a mean of 12.18 months and a standard deviation of 4.61 months.  The solid red vertical arrow that is pointing upwards represents our current time position on the probability curve, initiated from time zero (the first day of the latest 50-day SMA inversion) and sliding to the right as time elapses.  The prediction indicates a 50% likelihood that a recession will commence on or before early December 2023, with a greater than 95% probability that a recession will start on or before late July 2024.", "id": "16uveva", "created_utc": 1695943789.0, "score": 40, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "TLDR.

My guess is if the unemployment starts climbing, look down below to a sustained bear market.
