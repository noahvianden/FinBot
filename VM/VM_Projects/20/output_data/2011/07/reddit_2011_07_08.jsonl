{"title": "Reddit, my mom put my savings account into stocks.", "selftext": "So, Reddit, I am a very young teen not even old enough to get a job. My Mother decided that since $3k was sitting in my saving account I should put it into stocks. I agreed because it is technically not my money, it is my parents, but I, and I know my mom, have no idea what we are doing. I suppose she just did not want it to rot in a savings account. So, i bought some stocks. 20 microsoft, 60 costco stocks, or something along those lines. My brother, 16, also bought stocks, but he bought 10 in like 5 companies. We dont really plan on making alot of money, but i guess my mom planned on making more than the bank interest. Reddit, what do I do?                                                                            \n\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr: If you dont read you won't know my problems", "id": "ijy5f", "created_utc": 1310126758.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "This is a great chance for you to learn about how the market works.
