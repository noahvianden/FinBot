{"title": "FOLLOW UP - NEXVET PHARMACEUTICALS (PRICE TARGET ADJUSTMENT)", "selftext": "Earlier this week I posted some DD which got very little traction: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3x0yj0/dd_nvet_nexvet_bio/\n\nIf you had followed my advice, you would be up ~23% in the black on your position as of closing bell today. However, this is *NOT* a case of me trying to suck the ego out of my own dick. I truly believe, for reasons outlined in the post above, that there is still a large amount of upside in this play.\n\nThe reason for the significant spike today, is that someone decided to buy ~800k of shares for a total price of $2.5m. This purchase immediately bumped the market cap up ~6%, meaning that it was quite a significant purchase from someone who truly believes in the company. Without trying to speculate too much, there is a good chance that this investor was present at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2015 Animal Health Summit, where Dr. Heffernan discussed the success of their leading program (NV-01). The date of the conference was December 16, 2015, meaning that the significant purchase came just a little more than 24 hours after it wrapped up. While there is no PR regarding what was said at the conference, there is a chance that this will be coming in the near future. \n\nFor the reasons that I have outlined originally in my first post, as well as the new developments that have come for this week. I feel I need to *adjust my price point to $4.75* for some point in Q1. While I actually believe that it will go higher, 4.75 still offers ~37% upside from the current pps. \n\nHappy to answer any questions or concerns about this ticker as well!
