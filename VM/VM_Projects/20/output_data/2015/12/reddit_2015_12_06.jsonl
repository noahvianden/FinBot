All they need is a film that knocks the ball out of the park.\n* Down the road, imagine Netflix has increasing content, after all of the traditional cable subscribers die, the entire industry will fizzle out.\n* Imagine that the biggest content holder (I am not sure who it is right now, but lets assume Time Warner for argument) suddenly has all of their content available for the same price as Netflix, Netflix would be in big trouble because they would lose massive volumes of subs, CONTENT IS KING. Now Netflix has quite a bit of content, but a majority of it is crap (because good content such as Breaking Bad or blockbuster films cost quite a bit of $$ to license).\n* Whoever holds the best content/lowest price ratio will have majority market share. And right now that seems to be Netflix.\n\nConclusion: There might be a dip after Ridiculous 6 is released because its a shitty Adam Sandler movie, but overall I doubt it will last. The shares look to be up on weak volume compared to April 16th of this year when heavy buying was seen. I've been long, writing OTM Netflix covered calls for a while now because I believe Netflix will continue to grow.
