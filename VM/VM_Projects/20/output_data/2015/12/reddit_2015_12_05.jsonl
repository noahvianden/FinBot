The plot on the bottom is implied volatility, and earnings is marked by the red and blue icons. Approaching earnings, you see a rise in IV as uncertainty builds. After earnings, it collapses.\n\nTypically, one will look to sell premium just before the earnings announcement (as in the afternoon prior). That allows the strangle (in this case) to be put on at the highest possible IV level, thereby maximizing the premium collected. The hope is that, after earnings, the vol collapse is great enough to overcome any adverse move in the stock.\n\nIn this case, the OP has deliberately planned for an expiration prior to earnings, which will hopefully result in AMZN remaining between his strikes, as the possible big earnings move is after expiration. What /u/doougle is pointing out is that the volatility expansion in the weeks leading up to earnings is going to negate a large portion of that potential profit\u2014positive theta works for the OP, but negative vega loses money on a vol expansion, which is certainly going to occur. If the stock doesn't cooperate directionally, there's a potential double-whammy built into this position. (For example, see what happened during the August mini-crash\u2014you get unanticipated price movement *and* a vol expansion outside of earnings season, and, unfortunately, right before expiration. That sort of thing could devastate this position, especially if one were in it too big to ride out the undefined risk.)\n\nThat being said, [it's also been found](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/shows/market-measures/episodes/long-straddles-into-earnings-07-14-2015) that the opposite trade\u2014buying straddles or strangles\u2014in an attempt to capture the vol expansion leading into earnings is likely not a consistently profitable strategy, so I think it follows that what the OP is doing can't necessarily be considered to be reliably *un*profitable either.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "crash"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6228619813919067}, {"body": "yea you're right. he could've just built a double calendar and long after the earnings and shorted the week prior.
