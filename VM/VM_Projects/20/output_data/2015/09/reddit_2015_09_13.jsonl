This is my ultimate advice. I chose mining, I only invest in penny stock miners. Vast variety of different positions in penny stocks.  I invest I AIM (alternative investment market) which is the UK penny stock, you will get some companies which are worth 250m etc still in AIM, the clothing store ASOS which is huge, still trades via AIM although it could move to FTSE if it wanted.   \n\nTo the point,  find something you find interesting.  Maybe you like technology,  maybe fitness, maybe science, maybe  energy. Read, Read, Read, find some companies that specialise in that on your market, read read read, look at their histories, what's their aim, what are their prospects, what are their risks. I honestly believe picking something you find interesting makes it a lot more interesting to follow.  I really found a love for mining and found it interesting to learn all the laws, the processes etc, makes it all easier to know what's goof and bad.

How much money do they have / earn?  There is often a lot of placings  (where they issue new shares to raise funds) This causes dilution to the value of your shares e.g. how much of the company you own, and they can cause investors to bail,  which causes the share price to drop. They are sometimes needed, I had 0.72% of this company, and my shares at 0.0060p, after the placinh I now have 0.43% of the company and my shares worth 0.018p, because the placings have given funds to great projects and the market woke up. However some companies, can do placings to pay on going costs etc, and some keep doing it. Penny stocks are notorious for placings, so take in to account cash flow on anything you invest in, has it got money to do what it wants? if not don't invest and wait,  as you can probably buy in cheaper after a placing.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4091836214065552}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.564059317111969}, {"body": ">A friend of mine told me to start doing penny stocks\n\ntell your friend to nicely fuck off", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Seriously though.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1018698513507843}, {"body": "Actually don't even be nice.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18638813495635986}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5599346160888672}, {"body": "As a relatively new investor, avoid penny stocks.

These companies, aka \"Penny stocks\", mostly are companies with limited capital/resources, a great number of them are listed in OTCBB and pink sheets but they could be subject to market manipulation aka \"pump and dump\", unreliable/false company information posts, or worst, company could disappear overnight after taking profits. Also a good number of them are listed in bigger indices, plenty of them have great potential. Like bigger companies, they can also have top notch fundamentals and management (like the ones I own right now heh). \n\nAn example of a company with a massive potential and fundamentals, Madalena Energy (CVE:MVN) a Canadian oil and gas exploration/extraction company in Argentina, sits on top of Vaca Muerta shale, one of the biggest reserves outside Bakken and Eagle Ford of North America- still sell $70-77 of oil per barrel (sheltered by Argentinian laws). Strong balance sheet - ZERO DEBT, great cash flow, self funded capital and a shit tons of positive info that I can talk about all day (They also operate in Alberta). Risks are real but quantifiable like Political, Geographic, Currency exposure (they have to send their revenues back to Canada), not to mention competition is rising (Chevron, Exxon and other oil giants are buying/prepping to get exploration/extraction/refining around that area). Reasons it hasn't sky rocketed yet: Global economic forces (shit that's going on around global oil economy), also they can't expand that fast yet (conservative management, they don't aggressively borrow money for expansion) and Political reasons (upcoming Argentinian government has a big role to play for the private sectors). One of my long positions, deep value, most contrarian bet, Bought in at $0.24 a share, target price $2.00-$2.50, time horizon 2-5 years, shit that's 733%-941% gain if everything goes well for their stock.\n\nConclusion, it's not a one size fits all kind of a thing so don't use the term \"Penny stocks\" of any stock priced under $1 or $5 or $10 because of the negative stigma that comes with it, use the term Micro-cap/ Small cap companies. I own 2 more Small caps and planning to grab 2 more before 2016. The risks are real for them but you don't really need to treat them like an average pump and dump \"Penny Stock\" if they have great potentials and fundamentals. You have to find that needle in a haystack, that diamond in the dirt, if you really want to get into Micro-cap/ Small Cap companies because you can easily lose money too.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5252218246459961}, {"body": "There's a whole subreddit built around getting rich off penny stocks.
