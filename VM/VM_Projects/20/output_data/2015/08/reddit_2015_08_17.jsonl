A company as big a Ford has to spend at least 1 billion to design a new model and that's it.\n\nThere are huge costs Tesla will need to absorb up front to see there vision come to life, and they are still creating it and if they make it out alive, then you will start to see revenues, but until then investors are either betting for against whether or not Tesla will make it out alive. You either day trade it due to volatility, or you believe in it, buy it and forget about it.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "yeah thats true. I just read a article from fortune that said \"The analyst note raised Morgan Stanley\u2019s ( MS 0.24% )   price target for Tesla by 66%, from $280 to $465, which is more than 90% above the company\u2019s Friday closing price\". http://fortune.com/2015/08/17/tesla-stock-surge/\n\nidk if I should ride the hype train because 66% is 66% but I cant help to think if the company fucks up one time and there's a recall the stock is going to come crashing down like to would with any company but I'm worried that people wont come back you know what I mean.  there even giving out patents before they hit the real consumer market 30-50k range cars. idk maybe it just to much risk for me right now because I'm new to buying stocks. I just don't like see all the red on there sheets and I'm just looking for other view on the stock.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "One of the best parts of Tesla is (correct me if I am wrong) that they have less than 12 mechanical moving parts in the vehicle. They have had two product recalls in the past and it really didn't set them back, it's usually a quick fix and with everything on the software side Tesla can issue a patch to the system while your car sits in the garage. A while back they had issues with the model S door handles not opening properly, overnight they issued a patch to the software and poof all was fixed. They have increased range and power dramatically through software patches as well. There is enormous potential.\n\nIf you are looking for a growth stock, or some stock with consistent EPS growth, you won't find it here. If you read the intelligent investor, Tesla would be so far gone in terms of that type of evaluation. But if you read the Elon Musk book that just came out, you can see why people are betting on Tesla and Elon Musk. That guy will go to the ends of the Earth with every last dollar he has to see both Tesla and SpaceX come to life.\n\nFor full disclosure I don't own any shares of Tesla or SolarCity as I find the price too high for me personally, but I would love to get into Tesla at some point and fully plan on purchasing a Tesla within 5 years. It's not a save the planet purchase, that's a bonus, it's a sports car, with huge gas savings, it's got great speed and handling from what I read in reviews, it's almost completely silent and it's a beautiful looking car. It's not just the best \"electric\" vehicle on the market, it's one of the best vehicles in the market period.

Here is a quote from the Elon Musk book recently published\n\n> \"For both engineers and green-minded people, the Model S presented a model of efficiency. Traditional cars and hybrids have anywhere from hundreds to thousands of moving parts. The engine must perform constant, controlled explosions with pistons, crankshafts, oil filters, alternators, fans, distributors, valves, coils, and cylinders among the many pieces of machinery needed for the work. The oomph produced by the engine must then be passed through clutches, gears, and driveshafts to make the wheels turn, and then exhaust systems have to deal with the waste. Cars end up being about 10\u201320 percent efficient at turning the input of gasoline into the output of propulsion. Most of the energy (about 70 percent) is lost as heat in the engine, while the rest is lost through wind resistance, braking, and other mechanical functions. The Model S, by contrast, has about a dozen moving parts, with the battery pack sending energy instantly to a watermelon-sized motor that turns the wheels. The Model S ends up being about 60 percent efficient, losing most of the rest of its energy to heat. The sedan gets the equivalent of about 100 miles per gallon.\"", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3661528527736664}, {"body": "thanks for your help to", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08293865621089935}, {"body": "The majority of those wouldn't cause a recall.
