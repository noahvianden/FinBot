Even without all the debt, having a great product is not always an indicator of stock price/movement. I think most people who are buying, share the same mindset you do (YOLO). If the stock jumps this winter or right after post holiday numbers release, sell as fast as you can even if it means leaving a little profit on the table. When everyone else dumps to pocket yacht money with you, someone will hold for 1-2 days too long and barely profit at all.  \n\nOr the stock could slowly get to where you break even and stall out.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I never said I was going long - this is YOLO material - think Cabbage Patch kids....where are they now?

Never thought you were doing anything other than short term YOLO.
