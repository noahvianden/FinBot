{"title": "The Myth of Rate Hike = Stock Crash", "selftext": "I've been seeing a lot of posts here lately about how the rate hike (presumed to be in December now) is going to adversely affect the US Equity market. \n\nI don't blame you guys. In the last 10 years, we have seen rate cuts, to ZIRP, to NIRP. As a trader, I'm aware that during the QE phases over the last few years, any talk about \"normalizing\" rates sent the market into a free fall. Look no further than last week and today (Monday) when the Fed hinted at a December hike. \n\nSpooky stuff if this is the dynamic you grew up with and how you learned to trade over the last few years. New QE program? BUY! No mention of a rate hike? BUY! Pretty simple.\n\nNow many of us young YOLOers out there are facing their first rate hike. You sensed the panic in today's trading. Oh no, the spigot from the Fed is finally going to be turned off! What do we do! Time to panic!\n\nI made this post to assuage your fears out there about the inevitable rate hike. Let me first ask you gents, where else is there for the big money to go? Europe? Euros? Rubles? Yuan? Yen? China? Brazil? Bonds?\n\nSome think that the tide will wash out of equities and back into bonds post-hike. But is that really the case? What is the nature of interest and inflation, and how are they connected? What about money and assets, and their correlation? What does the interest rate really imply about the economy?\n\nWhat if I told you that ALL assets, including stocks and commodities, rise when interest rates rise? \n\nWhat if I made the bold declaration that as interest rates rise, people will shy AWAY from government debt since for decades now it has all been financed on the short-term so any tick in rates will obliterate the budgets of governments worldwide?\n\nFinally, what if I told you that the US Share Market is going to likely DOUBLE in the 12 months following December?\n\nMadness, I know, but this is a mad world and there are many other factors at play here besides the Fed and the Stock Market. For one example, over $9tn in USD-denominated debt has been created outside of the US in recent years (due to low rates), which is almost HALF the entire US National Debt. Those governments are now in a real pinch as dollar strength crushes their bottom lines.\n\nI know you guys would like some sauce so here it is. I read this guy's blog daily so you can see where I get most of my shit from. I will say that this guy's arguments are absolutely COMPELLING and at the very least worth a read. \n\nWhat's most amazing is that as I skimmed through these articles looking for sauce, one of them was written in January and he said the DOW would peak in May. This guy has made very spot-on calls. \n\nDisclaimer: he does not proofread. I am giving you a bit of a history textbook right now, but they are VERY worth the read as it will open your perspectives to the fact that the markets are not isolated but more like a rain forest ecosystem. These are in chronological order.\n\nIf you want the TL;DR: Markets and commodities will be in an accelerated rally AFTER the Fed hikes rates.\n\nhttp://www.armstrongeconomics.com/archives/26080\n\nhttp://www.armstrongeconomics.com/archives/28808\n\nhttp://www.armstrongeconomics.com/archives/29237\n\nhttp://www.armstrongeconomics.com/archives/31187\n\nhttp://www.armstrongeconomics.com/archives/31208 \n\nhttp://www.armstrongeconomics.com/archives/33828\n\nhttp://www.armstrongeconomics.com/archives/28070\n\nhttp://www.armstrongeconomics.com/archives/36934\n\nhttp://www.armstrongeconomics.com/archives/37240", "id": "3s8esj", "created_utc": 1447130432.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "Lmfao.

That is what makes it all work. Rising rates are a reflection of inflation for if they are not greater than inflation nobody will lend. You will see the negative rates now become the new peak in short-term and rates will then rise with inflation and so will share prices.
