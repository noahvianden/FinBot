{"title": "DD $TANH", "selftext": "I'm pretty new. Fuck you guys.\n\nI have a background in tax and financial planning, but trading and technical analysis is new for me. The following is me thinking that I'm now an expert after a few weeks research. Cut it up for me if you see stoopid shit.\n\nTantech Holdings $TANH is a Chinese company that sells bamboo charcoal bricks or some shit. Who really gives a fuck what they do. I'm looking at charts.\n\nIn all seriousness, their financial statement looks solid.\n\n- Current P/E of 12\n- Revenue and GP% is up Y/Y for three years\n- Net income surged up in 2014 over 2013 due to increased GP% and reduced operating expenses\n- Current assets (most of which are receivables) more than cover total liabilities.\n\nBut this is all \"value investing\" bullshit. We're here to YOLO, right? \n\nIt looks like they had an IPO in March of 2015 at which point the shares were trading around $10 and eventually reached nearly $34 before precipitously crashing to a low of $3 in late October. Question I have is \"why the crash?\" And so far, the only thing I can come up with is that the IPO fervor wore off and the market over-reacted. I could be missing a key bit of information here, though.\n\nSo now we're at a point where I believe there may be a reversal impending.\n\nHere is my chart analysis: http://i.imgur.com/X8oz1Lg.png\n\nForgive the pleb, non-Bloomberg chart.\n\nBullish indicators:\n\n- RSI is approaching 50, signaling possible trend reversal.\n- MACD is approaching 0, again, signaling possible trend reversal.\n- DownAroon fell below 50, i.e. no new lower lows in some time.\n- Bullish divergence in the RSI. A couple weeks ago, the price reached lower low, but RSI held higher low.\n- ADX above 20 with an impending crossover of +DI over -DI\n- Price moved above 20 day MA\n\nBearish indicators:\n\n- most recent 2 candles are morning stars\n- general downward trend on 50 day MA\n- Upward flag/pendant consolidation after downtrend\n\nNeutral points:\n\n- Consolidation in price and Aroon indicators (Aroon not shown on chart linked.)\n- Support around 4.30, resistane around 5.60\n\nHere would be my entry triggers:\n\n- MACD crosses above 0\n- RSI crosses above 50\n- Hammer or bullish engulfing candle\n- UpAroon spikes\n- Price spikes above consolidating resistance line\n- +DI crosses above -DI\n- ADX increases, provided preceding trigger fires\n\nThe more of these that trigger, the better I would feel about the position.\n\nHere would be my non-entry or stop-loss triggers:\n\n- MACD crosses below signal \n- Morning star or bearish engulfing candle\n- DownAroon spikes\n- MACD oscillator crosses 0\n- Price drops below consolidating support line\n- +DI falls further below -DI\n- ADX falls below 20 indicating no significant trend\n\nThe fewer of these signals, the better.\n\nThis DD has been fucked. Fuck you guys. Do your own DD before buying, you fucking nitwit.\n\nThanks,\nJohny_Horsecock\n\nEdit to add: even though their financials looks solid, this company looks sketchy as shit. I can't find 2015 quarterly reports, and their website looks like a 2-year-old english-as-a-4th-language child made it.
