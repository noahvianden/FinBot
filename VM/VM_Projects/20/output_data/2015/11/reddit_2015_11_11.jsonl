And why do you compare this steady decline of WMT that started 11 months ago to the drop seen during the '08 stock market crash? Most people would say 2015 was still a bull market (with a correction in August), so the problems with WMT are not caused by a bad market environment in which all stocks drop. \n\nAlso, I'm not entirely convinced that this stock has stopped dropping quite yet (I'm actually still holding part of my shorts from October). I'm not trying to be antagonistic on purpose, but I really think WMT is not a good buy as it's probably the weakest Dow stock at the moment.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": ["crash", "wmt", "dow"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Get your punk ass to investing", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah!!
