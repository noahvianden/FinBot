They are finally releasing some highly anticipated games for both of their \"new\" consoles. Not to mention that they are making money in new ways that they never have before such as direct downloads from their online store(Every game nintento has ever released is available for purchase from their online store with the release of the WiiU), Amiibo's (cannot remain on the shelves), and what I consider an unlocked potential from their intellectual property portfolio.(The only company I can think of with a greater IP footprint with children is Disney by comparison). Just imagine where a partnership with Netflix could lead if they start making series based on Nintendo characters.(http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/08/netflix-legend-of-zelda_n_6640010.html) \n\nI'm very long myself, but I would love to hear your thoughts on the matter.", "id": "2yg87v", "created_utc": 1425915722.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Congrats on the 25% daily gain", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "And another 30%.

Nintendo (mostly) exists in a vacuum, because they run a mostly closed loop.  As long as enough people buy Nintendo systems to ensure a sales base for future Mario/Zelda/Pokemon/etc titles, Nintendo will continue to do just fine.  The market gets all weird about them  because their numbers are so skewed compared to Sony and MS, but frankly that's apples and oranges.\n\nHere's my bottom line: Nintendo isn't going anywhere, nor are they going to post massive losses any time soon.  The Wii U has already sold 1/2 as many units as the Gamecube did in its entire lifetime.  This year will probably not be super profitable for Nintendo, there haven't been a lot of flagship titles to boost earnings.  Super Smash Brothers has maybe sold 1-1.5 million units; it's a financial life preserver that Nintendo has taken to throwing out within the first year or two of a system launch while they prep the heavy hitters.\n\nMeanwhile, Sony has all but abandoned the PS Vita, so unless they announce some *major* titles in May at E3 you can bet that Nintendo will continue to dominate the portable space.  If Sony doesn't seriously resurrect the Vita, I would expect a (large) uptick in Nintendo's share price by Q1 2016.  If Sony does try to breathe more life into the Vita, then you probably won't see NTDOY start to (heavily) climb until Q4 2016 or Q1 2017, unless they announce new Zelda/Mario due by Xmas 2015, but that's *very* unlikely. Most likely this holiday season will be more also-rans: Donkey Kong, Star Fox, etc.  Profitable titles but mostly treading water.  Holiday 2016 is when you can expect to see a 5-10 million seller like Zelda or Mario, etc.\n\nEither way, I would go long on NTDOY every earnings call between now and 2017.  The market is going to keep betting against them because they aren't cranking out PS4/XBox One numbers, but every time they get on the phone and quietly announce that yes, they're still making money, you can profit from that jump.\n\nIf you want a really good estimation of the kind of market you can expect from Nintendo, look at 2000-2005.  The Wii U is selling and acting like the Gamecube, and the 3DS is selling and acting like the GBA.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5577560663223267}, {"body": ">Not to mention that they are making money in new ways that they never have before such as direct downloads from their online store\n\nTheyve had the virtual console since at least 2007.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I wish I could find the specific article that focused on just sales figures from the virtual console YOY for the past couple of years.
