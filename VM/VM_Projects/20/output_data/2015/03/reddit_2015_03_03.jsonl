Greater growth prospects than visa or mastercard. Buffet likes them.\n\nWell, AXP is trading at a big discount to MA and V as far as PE and PB is concerned, so let's see if we can't find out why.  MA has about double the ROE as AXP.  V's ROE is less, and much, much less consistent. MA is leveraged about 2 to 1 Assets to Equity, V is less than 2 to 1, and AXP is leveraged about 8 to 1.  As financial firms, perhaps there's a reason for it.  The big thing that pops out to me is that is AXP has way more assets than the other two.  A look at the books shows that they have $47 billion in accounts receivable and $70 billion loaned out.  The loan makes me thing that AXP is more of a bank than the other two.  Im really not sure.\n\nTheir ROA is a lot worse than MA and V too.  At less than 5%, it's not very pretty.  Figuring it may be unfair to compare AXP to MA and V, I decided to compare it to a bank, WFC.  WFC is the best bank in the business, and it has a ROA of only 1.44.  So I think that's the lesson here:\n\nAXP is a hybrid of credit card services and banking.  That's my estimation at least.  Someone please correct me if Im mistaken.\n\nMargins are good.  Revenue has been increasing at a rate of less than 5% a year for the last 10 years.  That rate has worsened in the last 3 years.  No bueno.\n\nOperating margin is good and increasing.  9% over the last 10 years, and a whopping 18% over the last 3.  So even though the top line has been meandering, the business is getting more efficient.\n\nNet margins are good. Net profits have only been increasing at 5% over the last 10 years, but are up 14.5% over the last 3 years.  \n\nThey've been buying back shares, so EPS has been able to out growth Net profit at 7% and 19% respectively.  \n\nStill, Id be concerned over the shoddy revenue growth.\n\nCash Flow from operations is essentially flat.  That's bad.  FCF is also flat.  Hey, I'm not going to call out APX for financial engineering.  Im not an expert.  Im not even an accountant.  But I would tell you that when you have flat cash flows, lackluster revenue growth, and still decent net income increases, I start to get suspicious.  It's hard to rig cash flows and top line growth.  It's easy to rig Net Income and EPS.  Just something to think about.\n\nOn a side note, thank you for bringing up AXP because I noticed Capital One is going for it's book value.  Ill have to take a look at that later.\n\n>BAC - Legal liabilities almost gone. I trust the management. Interest rates can only go up.\n\nSpeaking of book value.  It's selling for 4/5ths book value.  ROE is pathetic.  ROA is sad. ROIC is sad.  So look, we know the company hasnt recovered from the crash.  We want to know is, can it get back to pre-crash form?  Let's look at the revenues.\n\nRevenues are no where near pre-crash.  Operating margins are terrible.  Net margins are terrible.  Shares are being diluted.  It's kind of disgusting to think this company has over 2 trillion in assets.\n\nI don't see a lot to like about BOA, but then again, banks financial statements are a lot tougher to read than what Im used to.  \n\nI would take a look at WFC.  They out perform BAC in every category and have outstanding management that didn't get caught with their pants down in '08.\n\n>BRKB -Why not?\n\nROE, ROA, and ROIC are all below average.  It's hard to just BRK against a peer because theres not too many $360 conglomerates.  Maybe 3M is the closest?  Or Disney?  Anyway.\n\nRevenue growth of 10% over the last 10 years, slowing down to over 9% over the last 5.  Operating Income is 13% over the last 10, and only 12.4% over the last 3.  Operating margin is increasing.  Net income grew at about 10% over the last 10, but at nearly 16% over the last 3.  Profit margin is about the same.  Not sure how that's possible.\n\nLooks like the net margin had been depressed, but has since come back up.  So even though revenue growth is declining, you see an increase in net income growth.  Number of shares has actually increased over the last 10 years.  Kind of surprising given that Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend.  You'd think they'd at least be buying back shares at a higher rate than they have been.\n\nDebts not a problem.  Cash flow from operations has been doing wonderful.  FCF has been at about 10% over the last 10 years, but at almost 23% over the last 3.\n\nGiven the choice, I prefer stellar cash flow growth over earnings growth, since earnings growth is easier to rig.\n\nAt 1.4 P/B, I think it's fairly valued.  Buffett started buying back stock at 1.2 P/B because it was vastly undervalued, so 1.4 is probably reasonable.  \n\n>NTDOY - Wii U might be a failure, but it could still pick up with Zelda coming out. I knew Amibo would do well, but its just a small part of Nintendo.\n\nOh boy.  Lets get this started with.  Before I dive into the numbers, let me just say that I was trying to convince my friend to sell his Nintendo shares back in 2012.  And they were at $13.5.  Theres too many wonderful companies out there to be buying into these dying breeds.\n\nLook, I love Nintendo.  Ive owned every Nintendo console at some point in my life, except the Virtual Boy.  Ill be standing outside the Gamestop opening day for Zelda.\n\nBut one game can't save a shitty company.  The video game business is changing.  Nintendo has always refused to adapt.  Whether it was CDs, or online play, or mobile.  They're gonna get killed.  Now they have an amazing stable of IP, so their stock will never go to zero.  But they can dilute their shares like hell on the way.\n\nOk, lets get this autopsy over with.\n\nYou need to make money for return metrics to matter.  So we can skip those.  Revenue is on a 5 year skid. Operating incomes are negative.  Net incomes are negative.  Their cash reserve is less than half of what it was 4 years ago.  Still no debt?  Wow.  Thats a silver lining.\n\nYea, and everything else is bad.  There's not a lot to love here.  Aside from the video games themselves.\n\n>ZTS - This is more a gamble than an investment.\n\nSo it's like a pharma company for animals?  Ok.  Well it looks like the company is doing very well for itself.  Return on Equity, Assets, and Invested Capital are all good.  Margins are all good.  Revenue growth has been pedestrian after an initial explosion.  Operating income and net income are both doing great tho.\n\nShares are staying the same.  Odd for a young company.  Debt is a concern, but considering it's a young, high growth company, it's to be expected.\n\nWell.  Revenue growth hasn't been high, remember.  And thats important.\n\nCash flows look good.\n\nLook, I don't understand the business at all, but from just the financials, it looks like you're doing fine.\n\nAs for it's valuation, well that's anybody's guess.  I cant value small cap companies like this.\n\nDisclaimer: Im long BRK, DIS, WFC, and my penis.\n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I'm with you on BRK, DIS, and WFC.

Basically, in my mind it comes down to the Apple Watch.  It'll be the first major post-Jobs product out there.  If it's a success, then Ill be sold on the company.  As it stands, Im not sold on the Watch.  I think there's a lot of question marks.  Interface?  That screen is tiny.  Durability?  Watch glass is remarkably strong for a reason.  Apple doesn't have a great history when it comes to durability, so we'll see. Also, add-on hardware.  Meaning hardware where you need to also own a previous piece of hardware, has never worked in the video game industry.  We'll see if this is so different.\n\n>BRK.B - It's Buffet's fund and it has been going up for decades, might as well hop on.\n\nI gave a pretty good description of BRK.B in this thread.\n\n>BX - Great dividend, and they seem to really know what they are doing.\n\nTheyre paying a crap town in dividends while blowing up the share base while taking on a lot of debt.  Throw in all the money they were losing for years because of the crisis, and I dont think theyre a very well managed company.\n\n>DIS - This stock has been going strong for a while now, and they have a couple of big things coming up (star wars) and own some great franchises. Also, dividends.\n\nI've talked about them a lot too recently.  Basically, it's hard for me to make a bear case for them.  Theyve had tremendous growth recently, and there's no real reason for it to stop.  Their big money maker is television.  ABC, ESPN, and Disney.  It'll be interesting to see how well their Marvel TV shows do.  Theyre doing a Daredevil on Netflix.  So Disney definitely understands where TV is going.\n\nTheir parks continue to amaze.  Increased volume and sales per guest.  That's not easy.  Shangai is opening up soon, but theyll only own 43% of it, and international park sales are dwarfed by domestic.\n\nThe studio is clearly the most exciting part of the business.  If you look at their movies Pre-Avengers and Post-Avengers, it's quite amazing.  Iron Man 3 and Captain America 2 made nearly twice that of Iron Man 2 and Captain America 1 respectively.  I call this the Avengers effect.  Hell, even Thor 2 made something like 40% more than Thor 1.  And Thor 1 sucked.  More importantly, however, was that Captain America 2 and Iron Man 3 were both better than the movies that came before it.  So quality is improving.  And here's a crazy thing.  Guardians of the Galaxy, which is a non-entity, made more than X-Men: Days of Future Past, which is a prime IP.  That's simply amazing.  \n\nSo I see no reason why the Avengers 2 cant make 30% more than Avengers 1.  Which means, it'll make $2 billion.\n\nAnd Star Wars.  I see no reason why it cant make $1.5 billion.  Hell, the was the first Star Wars movie in 15 years, the Phantom Menace, made $900 million in 1998.  That's $1.3 billion in today's dollars. This will be the first Star Wars movie in 10 years, and it'll actually be good.  \n\nUnfortunately, the studio only makes up about 25% of sales.  But still, theyre adding Star Wars attractions to their parks, and we'll see how their Star Wars tv shows do.\n\n>GLAD - A bit riskier, but I like their monthly, high yield dividend.\n\nThey've been paying out more in dividends than they've been earnings for the better part of a decade.  Unless they've found some magic way to do business, Im pretty sure this is a trap.\n\n>KKR - Same as above, great dividend and seems to be doing pretty well.\n\nLooks like they're taking on debt to keep up with the dividend.\n\n>SCTY - Just holding for a couple of days (I've been buying around 50 and selling around 55 for months now)\n\n>WPX - Plan to dump this as soon as it hits 12 again.\n\n>XOM - Biggest part of my portfolio, what can I say - huge, slow growth and - you got it - dividends.\n\nI don't really understand oil.  The industry's been declining for a few years now.  It isn't just the recent drop in oil prices.  I can't explain it. If someone knows why the oil industry can turn it around, Id like to hear it.\n\n\n>Hoping to add KMI soon to my collection.\n\n191% dividend payout ratio.  Tons of debt.  Explosion of shares.

So if a company's dividend yield is 8%, then the market has probably decided on 8% for a reason.\n\nNow, the market can be wrong from time to time, but on average, there's going to be a reason.  In this case, the reason was because the companies were taking on debt and printing shares like their last name was Bernake.\n\nI think DIS/XOM/BRK/AAPL is a wonderful long term hold portfolio.  I dont understand why the oil industry is getting hammered, but XOM is likely to emerge...IF the oil industry ever does come back.  I mean... it's entirely feasible that electric or hydrogen cars start taking up real market share.  Or even, if commercial vehicles, like semis, taxis, and construction vehicles move away from diesel / gas.  Or if municipal vehicles like squad cars, ambulances, and fire engines do.  \n\nAs for BABA, I stay away from Chinese companies all together.  I dont trust the reports coming out fo China.  I dont trust their government.  Theyre a dictatorship.  That's bad for business.  BABA specifically, was forced to pull Alibaba Pay from their holding company.  And despite owning 40% of the business, Yahoo! was powerless to do anything about it.  That's pretty shitty.  It has to do with China's laws against foreign investment in crucial businesses.  Needless to say, China's laws and their interpretation of those laws can change at a moment's notice.  As Yahoo! found out.\n\nAs for a derivative play, I have no idea.  I only think long term.\n\nEdit:  Oh I get my financial information from GuruFocus.com.  Just be VERY careful.  You get what you pay for, and it's free.  It provides 10 years of information, so I use it, but any thing that requires a formula is NOT to be trusted.  Even something as simple as EPS.  And when looking at BRK, look at BRK.A, not BRK.B.

Lot of financial leverage for a cash cow though.\n\nThey've been buying back shares overall, so that's good.\n\nRevenue is completely flat.  Operating Income and Margins are falling.  Net Income is flat.  Pretty lousy company.\n\n>VZ- bought this when I was very young (still am) i figure the dividend isn't bad and I think it will always remain one of the top telecommunications companies in the U.S.\n\nI don't like the long term prospects for Verizon.  In 10 years, how we get internet is probably going to be completely different.  Lousy growth.  I would take the time to compare them to Sprint and ATT, but they have $110 billion in debt and shares are exploding.\n\nIt's a sinking ship.\n\nThing to remember is, a company doesn't set the dividend yield.  The market does.  And if the market is giving a company a 4.4% yield, while most companies are currently in the 1.0-2.5% range, then you have to ask yourself why.  It could be that the market is wrong. But even more likely, it's a lousy company and the market recognizes that.  But the dividend does keep the company's stock price up.\n", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "thank you for the analysis, sorry if its asking for too much but what would you recommend to replace GE and VZ possibly?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Id feel uncomfortable recommending a stock.

They do look capital intensive though, with major capital expenditures recently.  \n\n>HRB: Tax season, its the first time anyone has to deal with Affordable care act in their taxes so their business should rise\n\nAll the efficiency metrics are good, but there's just no growth.

Every efficiency ratio, every growth metric, it's conservatively financed.  My only issue would be the price at 26.50 PE.  You better be damn confident this sucker has some big growth coming up, cuz it's aint a cheap stock.\n\n>THCZ- My most risky stock. They're coming out with a hemp based beverage (It's already created and is waiting shipping which should occur in the next week to amazon).\n\nWell, there's no financial information on the stock.  That I can find.  Um.  So Ill just give you my general thought on pot stocks.  Instead of trying to pick out the diamonds in the rough.  The one in a million penny stock thats going to take off.  Why not choose a more, conservative, but higher probability play on marijuanna becoming legal?\n\nThe tobacco companies.  I can essentially guarantee that they have extensive contingency plans in place if pot ever becomes legal at the Federal level.  How hard would it really be for them to make the switch?  They already have the massive distribution.  \n", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amzn", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Ooh, can I play too?:\n\nI have long positions in these companies, which are fairly self explanatory so won't go into detail.\nGoogl,fb,amzn,dis,ma\n \nMy other long positions are:\n\nGILD - I think they are undervalued, have recent deals for supplying hep drugs to Europe, good portfolio of other drugs\n\nSLCA - Good financials, rather large moat as they have established infrastructure, lots of fixed contracts for the next few years. Prices have taken a beating due to oil prices, but eventually they will pick up again, I think America will continue fracking rather than importing, so sand will continue to be in demand. Bought in at $26. \n\nMNKD - recently launched afrezza on the market, basically insulin for diabetes that is delivered orally (inhaled) rather than injected. This insulin delivery is much faster acting than injected and closer mimics the body's insulin production. Has 950m deal with Sanofi for marketing. The technosphere oral delivery method will be adapted for other medicines in the future. Great leadership from Alfred Mann, buyout unlikely. Heavily shorted.\n\nANET - Good technology, good talent, room to grow. Motivated to take market share from cisco and I think they are capable doing that.\n\nNOV - bought recently as prices took a hammering with oil dropping, but oil machinery will always need to be maintained or replaced, so think rebound is inevitable. Large market share.\n\nSRCL - Good established infrastructure /moat. An industry that will always be needed, ongoing acquistions make the company even more entrenched.\n\nSsys - taken a beating lately after maker bot acquisition, but I think will eventually rebound. I see industrial 3d printing expanding in the future and feels that ssys is superior to ddd\n\nBR - large moat, good financials, blah blah \n\nSWIR - good technology in sector that is only going to expand.
