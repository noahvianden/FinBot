{"title": "Valuation worksheet for your use", "selftext": "Hey everyone - I gave it a lot of thought, and I feel that letting other people use my valuation worksheet is the right thing to do. I'm not quite sure how to share files on Reddit, but if you PM me, I will try. \n\n\nThis worksheet has some idiosyncrasies - worksheet items that would be plainly obvious to me may seem quite odd to you. I will try to answer any questions as I can. I believe that the \"bugs\" are mostly worked out at this time. \n\n\nThis document is explicitly public domain. \n\n**EDIT:**\n\nHere is a filled out [worksheet for NFLX](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzX-9qxR6YHhWVpwcU1XV1BiMEE/view?usp=sharing). Note that I have used their FCF (-77) Instead of net income (83). You can use either, it's up to you. \n\nHere is a [blank worksheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzX-9qxR6YHhX1B0bEhmRmQ0Mlk/view?usp=sharing)", "id": "2wohyx", "created_utc": 1424545445.0, "score": 40, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "can you do you a mini tutorial as to the specifics of filling in the data. This link http://quotes.morningstar.com does not work by the way.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "The link should be http://www.morningstar.com/Cover/Stocks.html. I'm too used to my bookmarks and my own way of doing things.\n\n1. Step one, Visit Morningstar.com (or anyplace that has the ticker data)\n\n2. Enter the ticker in the quote box at top\n\nMore than halfway down, Morningstar lists the \"Financials\" for the ticker. You will be copying this information item by item from the most recent quarter.\n\n3. Open the worksheet, enter the ticker symbol and save the worksheet as the ticker symbol. For example, \"GE\".\n\n4. Use the most recent quarterly data (probably 2014-12)\n\n5. Boxes A6-A9 are self-explanatory. Copy the data. For example, GE had Current Assets of 403,800. Note that this is in *American dollars* and foreign stocks will *not* be displayed in American dollars. Be cautious when looking at, for example, Toyota (TM).\n\n6. FCF/Net income - You may use either Free cash flow or Net income, and probably should use whichever is more conservative.\n\n7. Box A11, A12, E6, E7 are self-explanatory\n\n8. Box E8 - Dividend. For companies not paying a dividend, enter \"0\". For everyone else, enter the last recent quarterly dividend (or its equivalent). Some companies pay yearly dividends, for example, and you would need to estimate their *quarterly* dividend by dividing their yearly dividend by four. As example, GE's last quarterly dividend was .23 on 2/19. They pay quarterly. Enter \".23\" for their dividend.\n\n9. Beta and shares outstanding are self-explanatory. For GE, the Beta is 1.29 and the shares outstanding are 10,042.19 - both are listed near the bottom of Morningstar's quote page.\n\n10. Box A15 is calculated off whatever you enter in box A34. **Don't enter data into A15.**\n\n11. Boxes A17 and A18 should be updated regularly as the bond rates change. Use the most recent data (as I have done here).\n\n12. Box A34 - enter the Mean Schiller PE10 ratio here.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much sir!
