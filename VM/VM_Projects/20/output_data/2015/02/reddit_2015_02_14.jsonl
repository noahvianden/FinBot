You can wait as long as you want for the right pitch.\n\nFor me, I like some reassurance that the company won't disappear in the time frame that I want to invest, which is typically very far in the future.\n\nWe all know Elon Musk is tremendous businessman having an almost religious conviction in his product, but let's look at the market; his competition. We have several car manufacturers out there now, they are very well established with deep pockets and even deeper R&D capabilities. So what happens if/when they release the electric cars that will directly compete against Tesla?\n\nRight now, Tesla is still stuck in that stuffy luxury car niche; competing against Mercedes, Audi, BMW. In this short amount of time, the Tesla brand has become more and more popular, but their production is still lagging anything to be considered a legitimate threat to luxury auto makers. Their results from last quarter also fell short from reaching what analysts thought they would be on track to produce. This has a lot of people hesitant.\n\nTesla stock has priced in some extreme growth for the company; growth that has yet to materialize except in market valuation. In the end, what really determines the movement of this stock beyond its fifteen minutes of fame is how many cars they can roll off their production line, and how quickly they can add extra digits to their earnings report to expand production capability.\n\nHowever, the longer the auto industry takes to step up and provide a direct competitor to Tesla, the more Tesla manages to survive and the more likely that a midrange car is released, which could signal the tipping point that investment firms will finally step up and say it's time to expand production. \n\nRight now oil has dropped to crazy low prices, so it makes fresh investing money even more rare for Tesla. What I would be watching for is how Tesla, the business entity, responds to this monstrous lull in oil prices which might last a month or a decade. How does the Tesla brand, an exclusive producer of electric vehicles, survive when the alternative just became much cheaper and sexier to investors. \n\nIf the production numbers don't lie, and it stays on a pretty decent run despite the tsunami it is fighting against, then you are looking at a true anomaly in the market. A diamond in the rough with ridiculous brand advantage. \n\nBut if it doesn't work out that way, you just lost a lot of money waiting for the world to think like you, and you didn't even cushion yourself by buying the company when it was trading close to its book value. There is an intimidating gap between the reproducible worth of Tesla's physical assets and how much the market is valuing it at. The only thing that can sustain that gap is a verifiable crazy brand franchise value, which has yet to materialize for me. \n\nSo I would say wait a few more pitches, and swing when the right one comes by.
