My question is, did you make sure there was no 3% fee that normally come with these offers?\n\nI do understand the allure.  About a decade ago, when interest rates were a lot more normal I did that same thing you are doing except I was buying 9 month CD's.  At one point I owed Citi, Chase, Discover about $60k.  I would get the offer, write a check, with no fee, buy a CD at 5, 6, 6 1/2% and pay the minimum each month on the card.  When the CD came due I would move the money to savings until the 12 months expired and then pay it off.  While I did make some $$, the appeal to me was using the banks $$ to make $$.

It'd also represent a symbolic middle finger since you're taking their money just to make money off of them.\n\nNational banks still have lawsuits popping up but most are already baked into the price. Though you could go regional bank route and sidestep many problem areas. I wont tell you which national bank to go after, but regional-wise SNV or RF are decent choices. RF is kinda lagging lately though, but SNV is in middle of buyback, has virtually no loans to oil companies (why they were one of few banks to still post profits last quarter), and will probably increase their dividend within 12 months.\n\nI'd wait til next market correction before jumping in on anything though, not hard to imagine you seeing a good 5-10% discount soon enough.
