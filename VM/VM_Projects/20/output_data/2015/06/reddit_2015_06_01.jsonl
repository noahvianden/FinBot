{"title": "So I want to make a WSB Bot", "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI haven't been here long, but im loving this sub. Ive noticed a lot we have a vast skill gap between newbs trading pennys and others trading complex options spreads. It seems like its hard to tell a lot of times on the trolls and the really bad ideas. Also, people with consistant good picks arent getting any credit, and others claiming they made a pick after a stock is up 50%. Hope to solve some of that, but also,\n\n\nThis is wallstreet BETS. I think we need a betting system. \n\n\nSo, i started making a bot, and quickly realized i have too many ways to take it, so I wanted to get the potential users opinoin:\n\n\n**Option 1:** Would basically be a virtual portfolio, you would message the bot after posting your DD with your trade details. And then post again to close...add to the position etc. Would hope to add some type of BS checker to check against market data to prevent people saying they sold AMD for $100. I started this option, but now think I like option 2 better.\n\n**Option 2:** More of a bets bot. You would basically message the bot in public (or private) after posting your DD and say something like \"I bet AMD is $4.00 by 6/15/2015\". The bot would then go grab the current price, and check again each day until your target date. It would record info like max loss at anytime, if it crosses your target etc. Looking for ideas.\n\nWith either option I would add features where you could check other peoples stats, current bets/positions etc. Depending on how much people like it/approval from the mods I could have it reply in comments etc, but I hate bots that generate spam.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Or am I wasting my time? \nPS: I have already started, have the whole reddit API wrapped, just need some inspiration. \n\n", "id": "385btg", "created_utc": 1433201559.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "I like it.  I believe it will keep those with good advice/DD separate from the jackholes that troll or BS, and will give all users a little confidence in what they are reading.  I like option 2 also.  Do you have to actively message the bot or will it pull text when you say certain words? I have no other insight, but I'm interested in seeing what you come up with.
