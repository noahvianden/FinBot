{"title": "Can anybody give me a good reason why the price of oil should continue to climb?", "selftext": "So far I have been replied to with:\n\n\n**OPEC controls the market** -  \n\n*OPEC used to be the say all end all to oil. Their problem is very transparent now though. If they artificially inflate prices, they will lose market share to people who can produce oil at those higher prices. They have very cheap oil, and the only thing they can do is produce more of that cheap oil to hamper foreign production...but at the same time they are trying to keep prices inflated while pumping and selling as much oil as they can. They simply don't have as much power as they used to....because they don't have an option like they used to.*\n\n**No I insist, OPEC controls the market because if they say they are going to cutback production, the price will jump**\n\n*I think you are half right. If they said we're dropping production, yes prices would skyrocket....right along with everyone else's production, and then we would have a supply glut...kind of like right now. The thing is...they can't say they are decreasing production...and they don't want to say they are increasing...but they are.*\n\n**Oil is too big to fail**\n\n*So your best argument is that oil is too big to fail? The government is going to bail out oil companies if they go belly up? I think growth and profits accelerate when the price of energy comes down...I would think consolidation in the oil industry would just lead to organic economic growth...rather than a disaster. It would be a disaster to people who have invested too heavily in oil.*\n\n\n**\"because we depend on it\", \"oil is king\", \"energy density\", oh and corn...just fucking corn** http://redd.it/32tiu1  \n\n*not going to reply, unless you insist*\n\n\n**My own argument - The dollar could be on the decline**\n\n*well semitard that is a good argument, why thank you semitard, but the problem is still there if the dollar inflates price...we have a supply glut. If the value of the dollar decreases, and oil continues to climb, it becomes economical for a lot of wells to come back online, and production will ramp, and at the same time, if prices are up, then demand will most likely go down. I suppose we could lift the export band at that point (or any point), but then what do you think OPEC will do?...not stop drilling and losing customers, that is for sure.*\n\n**Rig count**\n\nhttp://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Jaffe-Despite-global-risk-oil-prices-could-head-6197500.php\n \n*Jaffe put the break-even prices for oil production at $37 in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas and the Bakken formation in North Dakota, $48 for the Permian Basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, and $43 for the Mississippi Lime in Oklahoma and Kansas.*\n\nhttp://247wallst.com/energy-business/2015/04/12/low-crude-oil-prices-leave-thousands-of-u-s-wells-uncompleted/ \n\n*There are roughly 2,500 to 3,500 drilled but uncompleted oil wells in the United States, according to analysts at IHS Inc. (NYSE: IHS). As many as 1,400 of those wells are located in the Eagle Ford shale play in south Texas.*\n\n*What do you think rig count is going to do if oil goes up?*\n\n*Oh and plus, there are a lot of wells that still have to be completed by law...*\n\nhttp://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/oil-production-down-second-straight-month/article_8f3183a6-ff1f-5a79-b972-a1bd8e67b7c6.html\n\n*Wells must be completed within one year of being drilled by state law. More than 100 wells will hit that deadline in June.*\n\n**Demand is going to increase**\n\n*This is highly speculative, and loses weight as prices increase...and in my opinion a little ignorant considering the current oversupply. I don't think that demand has had its run and is over. I think that the control over the price of oil has had its run, and is now over. Production and demand are going to dictate prices, not so much politics and geology.*\n\n**Iran deal is going to fall through**\n\n*Probably, maybe not. Doesn't change the fact that they are increasing production and still have outlets to sell their oil.*\n\n**Everyone including Goldman Sachs say oil will fall to new lows, I do the opposite**\n\n*This pisses me off that I have to add this, but apparently a lot of people agree (which in itself is funny). Ok...so all the info available, and the people familiar with the situation are expecting the price of oil to go down...so naturally you are a genius contrarian investor that is about to make a killing. So that means you must have bought WTI when it was in the $40's, and when everyone was scared it would keep going down (like all the info suggest). Now what? Oil is up about 30% from that low...when people were being \"greedy\". You think oil is going to just keep shooting up? How much more? 40%, 50%, 220%? If you are buying up oil now, I would say you're jumping on a retard fueled band wagon, you are not being greedy, you are not being a contrarian investor, you are being a fucktard (if this is you're only argument). You might be able to make an argument about being greedy when oil goes back down to the $40 range, but I think I'm going to wait for more like the low $30. Also, I think the fact this same post got down voted to 0 in /r/stocks proves my point as well.*\n\n**Big picture.. we are barely oversupplied. When you talk millions yeah reserves can build up**\n\n*I agree, but oversupplied none the less...and reserves are still building. If the price of oil goes up, even more will go into storage, I think we agree here.*\n\n**Not to mention there are still emerging markets where oil will become a necessity on top of the fact that the population of the world is not diminishing. It's expanding exponentially**\n\n*Silly thing about humanity is that we evolve, technology evolves, infrastructure for emerging markets evolve. I completely agree that demand will increase. Emerging markets will grow...even faster with cheap energy. Renewable energy will still keep growing faster. Can you imagine how much different the world will be once we can harness fusion power? Anyhow, daily dependence on oil will decrease over time. And, we add about 1 billion people every 15 years...since about 1960, not exactly exponential (thanks for making me look that up.)*\n\n**Finally shale wells peter out fast**\n\n*yeah, I think it's like 90% of production is the first 2 years. We have somewhere between 2500 and 3500 wells just waiting to start producing though...*\n\n**Another conflict will spill over some borders in the Middle East**\n\n*This is probably the best argument I have got yet, and one that I'm fairly ill equipped to argue. I can say that it is highly speculative, but not really far fetched. I do feel like bringing an end to the control over oil could help the middle east get together for the better good of their nations to export as much oil as they can, but I feel like I should slap myself for saying that.* \n\n**a discovery completely undermining the estimated reserves left**\n\n*again, very speculative for near term, but not far fetched...and something we should be expecting in the future, but how far into the future...who knows. I do know we are growing less dependent on oil, and are moving towards renewables, plus technology evolves.  Since we are being speculative, I pose this question...What happens to the world once humanity figures out how to harness fusion power?...there will be a lot of people who will give a lot less fucks about oil when that happens (and we are very close).*\n\nFull disclosure: I own SCO...there now you know why I call myself semitard.", "id": "32xe8s", "created_utc": 1429281666.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "This was painful to read.\n\nIf oil continues to climb in the short term it will probably be because of currency fluctuations or something similar.
