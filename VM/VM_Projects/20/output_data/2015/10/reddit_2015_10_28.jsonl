They have been releasing their own content for a good amount of time now.  To my knowledge they have only released TV shows and documentaries up to this point.  This was their first movie.  Not only was their first movie successful it is also going to be nominated for awards.  None of the TV shows they have released have garnered bad reviews, that I know of.\n\n This movie isn't just one movie.  It is proving that Netflix can produce movies at the quality of a regular film production company.  That is unique considering that they were not originally a production company.  They were just a service company.  I think this is huge because now they can produce and serve their product, which allows them to have higher amounts of revenue.\n\nThink about it this way.  Netflix is now not only providing content it is also producing it.  In other words Netflix is starting to produce its raw good that it previously had to buy before.  Not only is it producing its own raw good it is also producing it at a higher value that other companies are able to.  ONTOP of that they also have there own market place to push their goods. \n\n Netflix now can pull the cotton out of the ground, turn it into a shirt, and then ship it off to their market to sell it.  Plus their product is a higher quality on average then their competitors.  Oh, btw, Hulu and their other direct competitors are not producing their own content.  So, they are ahead of the game.\n\nP.S. I am a little fuzzy on the terminology, but I think the term is called backward integration?  Where the company starts by selling a product, then buys a factory to make the product, then buys a mine to make the ore needed for the factory.  **tl;dr - Netflix has just shown they have completed their backward integration by producing this movie.**", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.032964713871479034}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2611294686794281}, {"body": "I yolod on this so it makes me happy", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16874492168426514}, {"body": "Netflix up $10 confirmed.
