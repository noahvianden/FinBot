They don't really have to make money in five years to stay on course. Amazon didn't turn a profit for like 20 years until investors put their foot down.\n\nThey will definitely produce a low cost EV at some point, although I am not optimistic about five years. They have to deal with how to secure their current brand while producing a cheaper car. That is a risky go-to-market and brand maneuver from a marketing perspective but I am not going to go into detail.\n\nThey have a long way to go to become a stable company and I really don't think it will impact investors' decisions the same way other companies do.

Twitter is another good example, they're taking ages to even come up with a plan, but it seems that finally they've landed who their real users are.

Tesla haven't really been hitting their projections, so I am not optimistic about them turning a revenue soon. And as of now, they don't have to. They way ahead in the game of electric car (which we can reasonably assume that it will be the way of future), and also investors love visionary such as Musk.\n\nThe question here is - when will Tesla become a rational stock, meaning that we can project their growth based on their forecast and performance rather than our emotion. That really hinges on a few things:\n\n* EV becoming mainstream - Something that may eventually happens, but how can Tesla push the market faster?\n* Staying ahead of competition - This is the biggest part of the current confidence, I will trust Musk's ability here\n* Success in pivoting their brand to the mass consumer marketing - This is really risky. They may need to create a new brand as part of Tesla (like Lexus and Scion to Toyota).\n\nTesla is definitely a long term investment, and it is hard to not fell in love and trust Musk's visions.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Well you're saying that Tesla is ahead of the game when it comes to electric cars, but I'm honestly not so sure that's the case anymore. They will be making most of the batteries, sure, but from what I have been hearing there are other major companies that are arguable ahead of Tesla when it comes to the promise in the electric car market. Companies with more resources and have already been making revenue for years, like BMW. Sure, Tesla has more electric cars on the market now, but the important question is who will have the best and most affordable electric car once electric becomes more standard and less of a \"movement.\" I'm increasingly worried that another company might be able to use and learn from Tesla's early mistakes and end up putting dominating in the electric car market. Imagine if giant companies like BMW and Google were to work together to make a self-driving electric car, with BMW making most of hardware and Google making utilizing the software. I know this is suuuper hypothetical, but a situation like this would probably relegate Tesla to a battery company that also makes some specialty cars... So essentially, not much different than now. And that would make share prices plummet. This kills the Tesla. \n\nJust the risk of something like that (or just the disproportionately bad effect of underperforming growth, which seems likely to me) , especially with how lucrative the sector is.... Yeah. That's why I'm completely done with Tesla as an investment. But as a company, I love them and their products. I may be wrong, but at least this way if I'm wrong I don't actually lose any money.

But I want to bring two points to light:\n\n* Innovation - So far Tesla has proved to be quite innovative, more so than other car companies I would say, in terms of design and technology application\n* Company Culture - I have worked in big corporations and startups, there is a big cultural difference where some companies are really willing to try new things while most big corporations have all kinds of red-taps\n* Elon Musk - The man is the fourth entity to send human to space.
