{"title": "[Serious]Question on $AVXLD", "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nThis is an idea that has been rattling around in my head for a few days now. \n\nWith the conference coming up in November and all the moves this has been making I am confident that there will be very good news. \n\nHaving said that, I am debating something... All my discretionary income has been invested (not just in Anavex) and I have a sizable amount of savings I have been building for a down payment on a house. My dilemma is this: \n\nA.) Do I buy shares of AVXLD now with the assumption of good news (in this instance I think it is probable) but risk depreciating that principal?\n\nB.) Wait until news comes out and put in a stop-limit order for a higher share price, even though I may lose out on some profits I can de-risk by investing on the run up from good news and possibly double down the amount I would buy with margin since it would be on NASDAQ? (I was thinking, depending on where we end up before the conference, if we are at $10, I would put in a stop-limit order with a trigger at $14 and buy at $14.50 - $15.00) \n\nIf this money wasn't for a house and my wife and I's future I wouldn't be so cautious. What do you all think?\n\n/u/pcx99 \n/u/theycallme1\n\nYou know I value both your opinions, so if you could weigh in as well I would appreciate it.

At $8 a share we're $2 pre reverse split which is EXACTLY the trading range I expected on the EVE of the conference announcement and we're still 25 days or so away! (no doing math before my 10th cup of coffee sorry).\n\nSo in my opinion AVXL is overbought at this point.   HOWEVER, there are some interesting positive catalysts In 18 days or so when it becomes AVXL again.\n\n* Institutional buyers can start coming in.\n* International buyers can start coming in (and remember Anavex's clinical trials are being done in Australia and it has had MUCH more pacific rim exposure than it has here in the states)\n* People will be able to buy on margin and to hold AVXL without affecting their margin.\n\nThen we start going into the conference run up itself and you're right to think the results will be good because they're also rushing to present p2a part b data!\n\nSo really I don't know.  I'm holding my core but not adding.  The stock is trading where I expected it to be before the conference just way earlier and I didn't know about the additional NASDAQ catalysts.  It may go up the next few days, but I'd expect $8 meets strong resistance but I expect when it actually does list on NASDAQ we may get up to another $1, maybe $2 before the conference.

I am personally in this stock, but got in at $0.48 the first time I saw PCX99 post about it. I feel like adding more now, but I think I will hold off, so I would be very cautious about starting it now.\n\nIn general I do not think your plan is great, from my personal experience with other similar stocks I will tell you what has happened, early results at conference causes stock to go down, even if they are good, because they aren't good enough, or they are not actually good. Why would they present bad data at a conference? To make it seem not as bad.\n\nI liked this stock at $0.48 because it didn't have a long way to go down, but now at $8.00 it can go down a lot and would have to get all the way up to $16 to double your money.\n\nJust keep in mind how you will feel if you lose 50% of your money.
