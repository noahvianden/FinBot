I think everyone knows this but sees that we are what like $8? From spy ath? Once we hit that for real id expect a 10% or so pullback over the next few months. Earnings will be telling I guess, banks didn\u2019t look too strong. I still expected end of 2024 to be even higher but a pullback is coming.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation"]}
