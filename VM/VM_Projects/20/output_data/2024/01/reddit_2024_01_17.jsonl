The advancement is very much still in question. \n\nEspecially because there is evidence that continuing to add to an LLM through it simply operating can have negative effects on accuracy and usability. There are questions if it's even possible to have an LLM that does what we want it to do over any meaningful length of time. Regular resets of the LLM's back to their original training data may be a necessity and if it is then we **may** have already reached the limitations of the technology. AI might just be a gimmick until we move on from LLMs and that would be disastrous for Nvidia imo.\n\n... Of course, its also possible that researchers find ways around the current generation's problems and LLMs become as ubiquitous as the internet itself. I'm not being pure doom and gloom. The potential for LLMs is off the charts. It could usher in a new era of humanity. NVIDIA could be a fucking **steal** at its current price, even after 4xing, which is insane. I'm just being realistic about the fact that we don't actually know yet. The technology is too new to fully understand its limitations. We need to figure out which limitations are inherent to the technology and which are inherent to our current implementation of the technology and therefore can be removed in the future.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Even if LLM\u2019s turn out to be a complete dud, which is unlikely\u2026 they\u2019re just so far ahead in the software/hardware combo of using linear algebra to solve problems in a massively parallel way. So the LLM architecture might be wrong, but the answer is prob some form of math architecture that relies on the same fundamental libraries already made super optimized through CUDA. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate, but Nvidia\u2019s monopoly in the space looks impossible to break in the next 5 years, and stock will easily pass $600 in the next few months. It takes too much investment in research time and money to design a new type of chip to take away even a small sliver of market share from them. IMO, the only way the stock falls is if it\u2019s possible to compress the models easily. So that only one big training loop of foundational models is necessary. But just look at the news Meta announced today about having 300k of Nvidia chips\u2026 for them it makes sense because they have so much data, training these large models with the latest chips is giving them the results they desire or they wouldn\u2019t blindly be grabbing GPUs", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "> So the LLM architecture might be wrong, but the answer is prob some form of math architecture that relies on the same fundamental libraries\n\nSure, but there's no reason to assume that this hypothetical new math architecture that relies on the same fundamental libraries would be standardized soon enough for Nvidia to take advantage of it. If the LLM architecture is abandoned, or more realistically massively scaled back, and its a 5, 10, 20 year gap before the next promising AI technology standard comes to fruition then the demand for those chips will precipitously fall in a way that would threaten the company's existence. Either because they need to survive on very little demand for an indeterminate amount of time after massively investing into a space that wasn't as fruitful as they thought or because it gives other companies plenty of time to catch up and who knows if Nvidia will still be the obvious choice when AI actually happens. \n\nAgain, I dont mean to be all doom and gloom. I'm not saying that anything you're saying is wrong. I'm just saying its built on a lot of presuppositions that MAY not be safe assumptions. People investing in the .com bubble back in the late 90's because they believed that the internet was the future weren't wrong either. But many of them still got fucked because some of their presuppositions of what the internet would look like were incorrect. Admittedly, that's not a great analogy because the internet is inherently de-centralized and Nvidia is hard-carrying the AI-market atm.
