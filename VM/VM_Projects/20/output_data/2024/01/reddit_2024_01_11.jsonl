Ives says an ESPN roll-up or major partnership \u201cwould make a ton of strategic sense\u201d for Apple, helping it \u201cgain valuable sports content, major TV rights across each of the major professional and college sports packages, and change the cross-sell opportunities and attractiveness of Apple TV looking ahead while putting Apple on the sports map, globally speaking.\u201d\n\n**My price target is $110-$120** depending on ESPN's valuation. The street values ESPN at \\~$30-$50bn on a standalone basis.\n\n**Why the opportunity exists:**\n\nDisney and Apple have a long, symbiotic relationship. This is largely due to Disney's collaboration and acquisition of Pixar from Apple in 2006 for $7.4bn. More importantly, Disney's CEO Bob Iger used to be on the board of Apple and Apple's CEO Tim Cook used to be on the board of Disney.\n\nDisney wants to take ESPN direct to consumer.

This is the catalyst.\n\nApple has long expressed an interest in getting into the sports content business. [This is evidenced](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/06/apple-and-mls-to-present-all-mls-matches-for-10-years-beginning-in-2023/) by its investment in [MLB and MLS sports rights.](https://frontofficesports.com/apple-wants-maximum-reach-no-limits-for-live-sports-rights/) But Apples not alone.

I will keep this relatively brief because I already put so much work into the pitch deck that I did for other purposes, but I want you guys to come on this ride with me so here I am.\n\nTLDR; short/ buy puts on BROS because their financials and coffee r bad. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Short Thesis**\n\nBROS is a strong short candidate for four main reasons:\n\n1. Incredibly weak financials that will drive further pressure to dilute equity holders/ throw a monkey wrench in future growth plans\n2. Poor product/ market fit\n3. Inferior product\n4. Growth engine is slowing\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Business Summary**\n\nIntro\n\n\u2022\tUS-based casual beverage company operating 850+ locations (\\~60% company operated, 40% franchised) across 16 states and employing over 22,000 people\n\n\u2022\tFounded in Oregon, the business went public in 2021 and hopes to one day have 4,000 locations\n\n\u2022\t\u201cDutch Bros is coffee for people who don\u2019t like coffee\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCompany History and Growing Footprint\n\n\u2022\tFinished running a DQ and looking for their next business, Dane and Travis Boersma started the company in 1992 as a double-head espresso machine on a pushcart in Grants Pass, Oregon\n\n\u2022\tBusiness has grown into over 850 locations across 16 states, operating a 60/40% split of company to franchised drive through coffee/ hand-crafted beverage spots\n\n\\-\tOnly franchise to employees with 3+ years of tenure\n\n\\-\tMuted seasonality- only flex +8% -> -6% from baseline\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReal Estate Buildout and Ownership\n\n\u2022\tAll its shops, warehouses, HQ buildings, and certain equipment is leased\n\n\\-\tRE leases consist of both commercial ground leases (land only) and build to suit (land & building)\n\n\\-\tTerms are usually for 15 years and usually have 2-3 renewal options for 5 years each\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPublic Financing and Follow-On Offerings\n\n\u2022\tBROS went public in 2021, and completed a follow-on offering @$26/sh to raise $330m in September 2023\n\n\u2022\tCredit facility of $650m ($350m revolver, $100m term loan, $200m delayed draw term loan)\n\n\\-\tInterest rate risk is hedged via derivatives (pay fixed receive float)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Analyst Outlook and Shorting Pressure**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6dn6cqyt2wbc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b385a2f45df4dff1428d5028a3dc2acf15eece7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z7vz3zav2wbc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef52be9bff67274b27e4c9241623aed3c1323d5d\n\n**Management Overview**\n\nFounded by two brothers (possibly Dutch?), one of them died from ALS and the other is chairman and is stepping back soon. They just got a new CEO on Jan 1, and earlier this week, they told the market that they are replacing 3 other members of the c-suite this month/next. Even if these new people are good, it\u2019s gonna take some time for them to get established and that will drag on the stock.\n\n**Same Store Sales Growth**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oh6p5lpw2wbc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9befe8c6fe9a7ee8d348acf0aa54c81f3383c2f2\n\nDamn, that\u2019s not a good graph. This past quarter, SBUX was growing same store sales like 7 or 8 %.\n\n**Do Insiders Even Want to Own the Stock?**\n\nAs the old saying goes, \u201cExecutives sell stock for any number of reasons; they only buy for one.\u201d And is anyone buying? NOPE (besides some piddly wink purchases of $150k by a new director and $25k by their general counsel. The chart below from open insider shows everything that happened from IPO to late Dec 23.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qwlhillx2wbc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=458de573611dbaf9c2ffc4ea52ecd0d612bc2033\n\n**Primary Research**\n\nI went to their store and bought like 5 different drinks. They tasted pretty damn sugary and bad, and no joke the Double Rainbro they sold me had a hair in the bottom (shitty pic but you can see the squiggle).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cqdagyjy2wbc1.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=e65ff6a07f85f9303e2913356c990f0fe1ac48c8\n\n**The Fun Part: Short Thesis**\n\n*Bad Financials*\n\nEven though they are growing their footprint, net income and operating margins have barely budged since IPO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9y0wyfkz2wbc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b8c69b47480bd0c2a71b1637d9c2df0a3b3b696\n\nThings look even worse when compared to their main public competitor, SBUX. BROS\u2019 EBITDA margin is barely above SBUX\u2019 NI margin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lgkitvl03wbc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f89a2beaea3091f9515703bfad7d359dbb948b8b\n\nI also run scans across a number of financial metrics, and BROS ranked in the bottom decile of public companies for Free cash flow margin (king of financial metrics), high loan rates and short pressure, downside risk, and bad changes in net working capital.\n\nFunny enough, it ranked in the top decile for media sentiment, with idiots such as motley fool trying to shove this down retail\u2019s throat.\n\nFurthermore, they can\u2019t afford to bootstrap their expansion Capex, so they will have to get the money from elsewhere (read: you the shareholder, or debt).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bhvz1iba3wbc1.png?width=2147&format=png&auto=webp&s=609adbab5625aced5fca210024917a8acc22dda2\n\n*Poor Product/ Market Fit*\n\nThe menu is superrrrrrr sweet, and has tons of weird names like the Annihilator and Double RainBRO. Too bad lots of Americans don\u2019t like drinks like that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5th3mcpb3wbc1.png?width=1620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac0a8b611202fcec545e5e53db0adfc47d3e363\n\nAlso, more people are becoming health conscious\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f42g4ou13wbc1.png?width=567&format=png&auto=webp&s=d96740bb92eb419e9d34294d71baa78a0d6cfde5\n\nAnd the rise of GLP-1 drugs could have a material effect\u2026\n\n\u2022\tWMT CEO John Furner said in Oct. \u201923 interview that it is already noticing pullback in \u201coverall basket\u201d size for those taking GLP-1 drugs vs. overall market\n\n\u2022\tBarclays warned that same month of material impacts to junk/fast food brands because of these drugs (70% of users visited fast-food restaurants less frequently)\n\n*Inferior Product*\n\nI mean this is just me, but their coffee tastes like dogshit steeped with balls. Sure this is an anecdote, but go buy some yourself and try it out to reach your own conclusions.\n\nCheck out this other review, which I found to be pretty accurate:\n\n\u201cLike Starbucks, Dutch Bros. Coffee is an Oregon-based chain that has expanded eastward. However, Dutch Bros. hasn't grown quite as much as its cousin chain. Most Dutch Bros. locations remain in the western part of the country. Depending on who you ask, though, having fewer locations of Dutch Bros. isn't the worst thing in the world.\n\nDutch Bros. is also similar to Starbucks in terms of its super-sweet beverage offerings. You go to these places to order a latte with three or more ingredients in its name, not for a quality cup of black coffee. With indulgent items \u2014 like Annihilator, a chocolate macadamia nut breve, as well as a whole menu category dedicated to milkshakes \u2014 the Dutch Bros. menu makes Dunkin' look like an unassuming French cafe. This chain certainly has the advantage of being less expensive than many of its competitors, but all of this feels like a dance around the fact that the coffee itself is subpar.\n\nOne Tripadvisor explained this, writing: \u2018I have been around the world a number of times and this was truly the worst cup of coffee I have ever had. Tasted like rusty water. Had to go to Starbucks to get the taste out of my mouth. Dutch Bros usually has low-grade coffee which I only resort to in emergencies, but this was truly the worst of the worst.\u2019\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Slowing Growth Engine*\n\nRemember that same store sales growth graph from earlier? Here it is adjusted for inflation. Woof.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2j2meg343wbc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f426a753c31be0eea397f39b4e607b243647ccf2\n\nHow long do we have to wait for them to grow to their goal of 4,000 stores? Based on linear and polynomial regressions of growth history, another 10-20 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0ipx9qf3wbc1.png?width=2147&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fde999bcd221b4cabb6503e55b763b5363467c5\n\nBecause they aren\u2019t getting the SG&A leverage that SBUX has, my hypothesis is that there is an inflection point in store growth that they still have to hit. The charts below are the margins for SBUX and Dunkin before they were taken private. If you squint really hard, it looks like SBUX net income margin started taking off around the great recession (17k stores) and Dunkin had that around 2012 when it had 7k stores. BROS still have a long way to go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5cq2fmh3wbc1.png?width=2145&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c3f115b9096dee8d22213eee02f4886d0565270\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Look around 2012, they had 7k stores then](https://preview.redd.it/mgr2sdji3wbc1.png?width=2141&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad52063ded6a9d3b611a01b6574f14b18cdfd0dc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Valuation**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4ovoj953wbc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e06e928c596ef9a7bbb603961353a9df95f9189\n\nFor the fun part, I had Chat-GPT help me code a macro to run 10,000 simulations of BROS\u2019s DCF, to come up with my price target of between $5.61 and $7.91.\n\nCheck out this really fucking high WACC:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8i45vn763wbc1.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee2bcfbefdae7e3e7e30337df97c14a164a1aa3b\n\nBrutal discount rate for those little dollars of FCF \u2639\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sfu6jhlm3wbc1.png?width=2145&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c9c1f6f100fb9a28336001561eb836ec1779442\n\n**My Position**\n\nI wanted to make use of my big boy margin, so I shorted 200 shares of BROS at $30.85 last week, and put the proceeds into AMD. I will probably leg in more as I watch (maybe another 50-200 shares?). I am thinking the Q4 earnings for late Feb could be spicy with this 1.84 beta stock. I added in a small hedge of a $40 strike call because you never know.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0inl0z6s2wbc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e01116fcaa7b25dfc69bd2c866485ed8417d6c2\n\nIf you can\u2019t short, can prob play this with pretty deep OTM puts. Maybe $20 strike? Idk I\u2019m not playing that way so I will leave that up to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conclusion, all bulls should go through a bear phase and experiment a little ;)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2nf4m6ls2wbc1.png?width=344&format=png&auto=webp&s=f190bbcc7c66a13f1475d5f5d0fe3f436cd617ff\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "194ezan", "created_utc": 1705013327.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|135|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10nkcqx/dd_update_amc_ape_arbitrage_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/194ezan/dd_the_one_time_you_should_put_hoes_before_bros/) \n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.33428025245666504}, {"body": "OP definitely drank too much coffee while writing this fucking novel of a post.
