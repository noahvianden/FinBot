Therefore, the process can now proceed without re-taping out, as production delays being minimized.\n\nThe report noted that NVIDIA\u2019s updated version of B200 is expected to be completed by late October, allowing the GB200 to enter mass production in December, with large-scale deliveries to ODMs expected in the first quarter of next year.\n\nPreviously, as per a report from The Information, NVIDIA\u2019s GB200 was said to be experiencing a one-quarter delay in mass shipments. Another report from the Economic Daily News further suggested that the problem likely lies in the yield rates of advanced packaging, which mainly affected the non-reference-designed GB200 chips.\n\nIndustry sources cited by Commercial Times addressed that NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell chip used to be facing instability in metal layers during the HV process, which was then resolved by July.\n\nIn addition, since the issue reportedly occurred in the back-end-of-line process, a new tape-out was deemed unnecessary.

{"title": "The Spicy Wheel (sell weekly ATM puts, add leverage and buy protective puts)", "selftext": "I'm new to the wheel but already fell in love with it (thanks u/ScottishTrader for discovering it for me). I only paper trade it now to get some experience and start losing money later. As any other young newbie, I\u2019m bullish on stocks and greedy af so I was scratching my head to literally reinvent the wheel. Here are the genius ideas I came up with (I mean copied them from other actually smart people around here and glued them together). I ask the elders now to slap me and patiently explain how this blows up my account by year end:\n\n1. **Stock picking**\u00a0is the most difficult step for me because I hate stock picking. My plan is to select 10+ companies I\u2019m OK with owning for 6+ months if needed and to mentally withstand a major storm (50%+ price drop) because I believe the price recovers sooner or later. I plan to wheel some risky stuff I enjoy (MSTR, TSLA) to add a bit of flavor (20%), but mostly (80%) boring blue chips diversified across a few sectors.\n2. **Money management**\u00a0is the other tricky part. The original wheel is relatively low risk when the sold puts are fully cash secured. On the other hand, I don\u2019t expect all of my picked stocks to tank 50%+ simultaneously. Because I\u2019m a stellar stock picker. Pun intended. I\u2019m also very greedy, risk tolerant and wanted higher risk/reward than the original wheel. For these reasons I plan to keep open positions with total size of 2x margin leverage of the whole account in case I get assigned on all positions. For example, if I deposit $50k and only trade stocks with exactly $100 price, I will start by selling 10 puts. Very risky, I know, but I\u2019m risk tolerant and don\u2019t mind losing 80-90% of the account in case of a major stock crash for the benefit of the higher profits. I do mind losing 100% though, more on risk management below.\n3. **Sell weekly ATM puts**\u00a0on Monday morning because theta decay, higher premiums, don\u2019t mind getting assigned, etc. I might buy the puts back if 80% profit is on the table before expiration and open new position higher.\n4. **I don\u2019t roll the sold puts to avoid assignment**\u00a0because I don\u2019t see the benefits. Obviously, I\u2019ll get assigned soon and often, but I don\u2019t mind that due to the reasons well explained by u/Machiavelli127 - thanks!\n5. **Buy protective puts**\u00a0120-150 DTE with strike about 30% below current price. The reason is protection against major stock crash to be even remotely able to consider the aggressive leverage (see 2 above). Using options calculator, I estimate this lowers and caps the max loss by 50% in case of a 50% drop. I plan to roll the protective put about 60-90 DTE to limit theta decay. It should not be too expensive, preferably covered by the premium from the first weekly ATM puts sold.\n6. **When assigned sell covered calls**\u00a0with strike at cost basis or above. Not yet sure whether weeklies (because theta) or 30 DTE to give the stocks more room to grow. Basically, turning the position to a diagonal bull collar. I\u2019m also considering whether to roll the calls if price shoots up or whether to buy them back at 80% profit and sell a lower strike if price keeps dropping. I welcome any advice on how to manage covered calls too.\n7. **Rinse and repeat**\u00a0when stocks get finally called away by some lucky WSB bastard.\n\nVery interested to hear your opinions, especially on why this would be unsustainably risky, thanks!", "id": "1fdhl04", "created_utc": 1725974077.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "It's a well thought out and well written plan. However, I think it still needs tweaking, or at least a different viewpoint.\n\nRegarding #2) Money Management, You need a better understanding of margin. If you have $50k cash and you sell ten $100 strike puts of XYZ, that's a notional value of $100K. Your conclusion is that your now on  50% margin and that you're safe.  But suppose XYZ is $80 when you're assigned?  No problem.  Reg T initial margin is 50% so $50k supports that.\n\nTo simplify further explanation, let's ignore the premiums received for selling the puts and the margin interest being sucked out of your account.  Suppose your broker has a 30% maintenance margin.  At $80, you have $30k of equity and a $50k loan which means that your margin level is 37.50% .  Now, you're only 7.50% away from a margin call (either pony up more cash or be sold out by your broker). That margin call would occur below $71.43 (10/7 times the margin loan).\n\nThe above segues to #4) Rolling puts.  If you roll your short put down for a zero cost, you lower the assignment strike.  By lowering the assignment strike, if assigned, your maintenance margin will be lower than what is previously was.  That's Risk Management. OTOH, if you did nothing, accepted assignment, and began writing covered calls, you'd have a high delta long position and you'd still be subject to the margin maintenance problem.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Very helpful, thanks, especially regarding margin requirements.
