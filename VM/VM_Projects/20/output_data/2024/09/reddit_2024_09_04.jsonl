The $130 price tag already accounts for their current customers and assumes triple digit growth YOY which isn't happening. \n\nWith only a fraction of revenue of actual $3T companies, that would put Nvidia at a $80-90 price range once the dust settles only because they're still profitable, just their growth has hit a ceiling.\n\nThis company is the next TSLA.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't follow this line of argument. A company can grow its revenue by selling more of an existing product, or selling an upgraded version of that product for a higher price, or both. Nvidia is doing both. \n\nNvidia is not Tesla. Tesla is in a low-margin business (auto manufacturing). Musk somehow convinced some investors that it's a tech company, but it isn't, as the numbers increasingly show. \n\nA better comparison to Nvidia would be Apple. Nvidia's data center products are like the iPhone. When they came out they had a 3 year lead over their competitors (Android for Apple, AMD etc for Nvidia). They continuously upgraded their product, sold more of them each year, and raised prices. It took Apple 10-15 years before that market was saturated and it now needs to find a new product to continue growing. \n\nIt hasn't even been two years since ChatGPT first took the world by storm. AI is in its infancy. Nvidia has a massive lead. The market will continue to grow for many years. We have no idea what the ultimate size of it will be.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Other than Apple started with computers, and they sucked. Now their products range from Desktops, Tablets, TVs, MacMini, Laptops, iPhones, VR Headsets, Watches, AirPods, and various subscription services. Nvidia is JUST data centres. That's the only reason they are where they are it's 86% of their revenue at $26B up from $4B a year ago, while iPhone only counts for 51% of Apple's revenue. That's why the price is where it's at, but from last quarter data centre revenue was only up 16%. Guidance for next quarter was only an 8% increase in total revenue. That's where I'm getting at with the company it's still going to grow, but the current price is investors expecting triple digit growth to continue, which it won't. \n\nData Centres aren't going to be a part of every household, hundreds of millions of people aren't buying them and they're not releasing new chips every years to upgrade them, nor are tech giants going to be spending at current levels once they have their infrastructure built. Eventually AI will have a diminishing return and it will be harder to convince big tech to keep buying at current levels hence why their only hope of maintaining profits are government contracts ie acquiring new customers OR they need to come up with a new product or service that's going to be just as successful to compete with the revenue levels of Microsoft and Apple and justify a $3T market cap. \n\nRight now at best they're a $2T company, hype and past growth are the only reason they have a $3T value, it's pure speculation and over the course of 2 years as you pointed out, versus two companies who have been through the test of time and cemented themselves as powerhouses. Nvidia's main source of revenue is for tech giants, apple's is for retail consumers. Nvidia's retail consumer product, gaming products, only generated $6B in revenue, so again if data centres don't work out for them, their revenue goes down by 86%. That's a pretty big risk for investors to take especially when they numbers show that portion of the company is slowing down. \n\nTLDR Nvidia's eggs are in one basket and data centres are not like iPhones, hundreds of millions of people own an iPhone and the brand marketing allows it to be a global icon, data centres aren't that, and numbers haven't proven the investment is even worth it yet, again, all hype and speculation.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You\u2019ve picked up on one thing there, which is that all the other mega cap tech stocks are consumer facing, while Nvidia is almost entirely business to business.

In the past, I've traded a few NVDA debit spreads that ended up being profitable, but a bit less profitable than I expected. For instance, I traded +110/-115 spreads in the past (bought for around 2.00) and thought I was going to double my profit when NVDA traded well above 115, but the most I achieved was close to 4 (with NVDA Trading well into the 120s)  even on the final week of the option. \n\nMajor questions:  \n\n1.

Will [optionsprofitcalculator.com](http://optionsprofitcalculator.com) give the best sense of how profit will change by time and price, or is there a different tool to use?\n\n2.

Should I aim for a 50-60% profit and then attempt to close this out?\n\n3. If I am interested in avoiding credit spreads and iron condors (e.g. limited gain for large risk), what are the other options strategies worth looking into (Besides wheeling and LEAPS)?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">  For instance, I traded +110/-115 spreads in the past (bought for around 2.00) and thought I was going to double my profit when NVDA traded well above 115, but the most I achieved was close to 4 (with NVDA Trading well into the 120s) even on the final week of the option.\n\n4 **is** double 2, a 100% gain, so not sure what the problem is? Sounds like it all went accordingly to plan. Since I typically close debit spreads at a 20% gain or better, you did way better than my typical trade.\n\nSo rather than doing anything wrong, maybe your profit expectations and your understanding of how spreads are priced is what's wrong? Why does getting a 100% gain seem like a mistake to you?\n\n> In the above scenario, why couldn't I close for the options for 5 despite being well in the money?\n\nBecause a high IV contract like NVDA is going to have extrinsic value all the way up to the closing bell of expiration day. That extrinsic value subtracts from your max profit. Max profit can only be realized at expiration when all extrinsic value is zero.\n\nMore importantly, the $3 max profit *should not have been your goal in the first place*. It's not a promise or a guarantee, it's just a slightly interesting theoretical value that need not, and indeed should not, influence your trading decisions, *assuming you don't plan to hold to expiration*, as you usually shouldn't. Some people see a number labelled **MAX PROFIT** and believe that getting anything less than that number means you failed. IT'S NOT TRUE. The profit target you set in your [trade plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourplan), which again is almost always less than max profit on a vertical spread, is what matters, not some theoretical number that is unobtainable without taking extraordinary risk.\n\n> What is an optimal profit target for a debit spread that gives a good balance between attaining a profit but not waiting til the final week of the option before taking profits? Should I aim for a 50-60% profit and then attempt to close this out?\n\nThat depends on your risk tolerance and the risk/reward offered by the trade. As I said, I manage debit spreads for 20% profit and 10% loss, but that's just because I tend to trade ATM spreads with roughly 50% win rate. A risk/reward of 10%/20% for a 50% win rate is +ev on average. If I only had a 10% win rate, 20% would not be enough profit for the risk I was taking.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, (win rate) / (100% - win rate) is the break-even risk/reward. So if you only have a 10% win rate, the break-even risk/reward is 10%/90%. For example, over 10 trades, you will lose -10% nine times for a total of -90% and win 90% one time, which nets to 0%, or break-even. Once you know the break-even, you want your trade plan profit target to be *more* than the break-even reward. So if you close the trade with a 95% profit, while still managing to no more than a 10% loss, you'll be profitable on average.\n\n> If I am interested in avoiding credit spreads and iron condors (e.g. limited gain for large risk), what are the other options strategies worth looking into (Besides wheeling and LEAPS)?\n\nIf the above is your psychology about debit spreads, I suspect that your credit spreads were doing just fine, but you're expectations were wrong. Were you defining a trade plan with profit and loss exit targets prior to expiration? Were those targets based on break-even risk/reward? If no and no, you should give credit spreads another try. You probably were just doing them wrong.\n\nVertical spreads are the easiest and most forgiving trades out there.

The IV of individual contracts are distinct from the IV of the underlying.  And it dropped enough to compensate for the price move.  How far down are the puts?  The fact that they went deep ITM (any delta in the 90s is deep ITM in my book) usually means that most of the price is likely intrinsic value at this point.   \n\n\n I also have no idea of the liquidity of those options as I have no view into that market.  If it!s not very liquid you may have paid up to get filled in the entry due to being one of the few, if not, the only buyer.  The market knows when the ex-div is and so at least that part If the downside move was already priced in to the price.  But if a bigger move was expected then the IV of that contract was inflated even more.  A lot of brokers will show expected move, but you can estimate it by modeling a long straddle.  I would have checked the expected move at the closest expiration after the ex-div to get an idea what the market is expecting.  If it was significantly higher than the dividend, there\u2019s something else out there.  If you bought puts and the stock moved less than expected, the put may not do well because you paid for a bigger expected move.\n\nSorry I don\u2019t have a definitive answer, my goal was to try to give you ideas as to why what happened did, in fact, occur.

{"title": "Dollar Tree shares slide after discounter cuts full-year forecast ", "selftext": "Shares of Dollar Tree fell more than 15% in early trading Wednesday after the discounter cut its full-year outlook, citing increasing pressures on middle-income and higher-income customers.\n\nThe retailer said it now expects its full-year consolidated net sales outlook to range between $30.6 billion and $30.9 billion. It expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $5.20 to $5.60. That compares with previous guidance of $31 billion to $32 billion in net sales and $6.50 to $7 for adjusted earnings per share.\n\nIn a news release, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Davis said the company cut the forecast to reflect softer sales and costs associated with converting 99 Cents Only stores. The company also said it has had higher expenses to reimburse, settle and litigate claims related to customer accidents and other incidents at stores.\n\nHere\u2019s how Dollar Tree did in its fiscal second quarter ended Aug. 3:\n\nEarnings per share: 62 cents, it was not immediately clear if it was comparable to what analysts surveyed by LSEG expected\n\nRevenue: $7.38 billion, it was not immediately clear if it was comparable\n\nDollar Tree\u2019s report comes about a week after major rival Dollar General slashed its full-year sales and profit outlook, sending its shares tumbling. Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos chalked up weak sales to \u201ca core customer who feels financially constrained.\u201d\n\nDollar stores, in particular, have felt pinched as their core customer \u2014 shoppers with lower incomes and little leftover money to spend on discretionary items \u2014 makes trade-offs after a prolonged period of pricier food and everyday costs. Walmart has won more business from value-conscious shoppers across incomes and newer online players, such as Temu, have also attracted customers with cheap merchandise.\n\nDollar Tree includes two store chains, its namesake, which sells a wide variety of lower-priced items like party supplies, and Family Dollar, which carries more food.\n\nSame-store sales for the company rose by 0.7% in the quarter. At Dollar Tree, same-store sales increased by 1.3% and at Family Dollar, same-store sales fell by 0.1%. The industry metric takes out the impact of store openings and closures.\n\nOn an earnings call, Davis said the company saw weaker sales, particularly on the discretionary side of the business. He said it \u201creflected the increasing effect of macro pressures on the purchasing behavior of the Dollar Tree\u2019s middle- and higher-income customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur original second-quarter outlook did not anticipate those pressures migrating to Dollar Tree\u2019s customer base to the degree that they did,\u201d he said.\n\nAlong with contending with inflation-stretched shoppers, Dollar Tree has faced company-specific challenges. The retailer announced in March that it would close about 1,000 Family Dollar stores, citing market conditions and store performance. Then, in June, the company said it is considering selling the Family Dollar brand.\n\nDollar Tree bought Family Dollar for nearly $9 billion in 2015 and since then, it\u2019s struggled to strengthen the grocery-focused chain and better compete with Dollar General.\n\nThe liability claims also added to the company\u2019s challenges. On the company\u2019s earnings call, Davis said the outcome of claims, particularly older ones, \u201chas become increasingly challenging to predict given the higher settlement and litigation costs that have resulted from a more volatile insurance environment.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe claims have continued to develop unfavorably due to the rising cost to reimburse, settle, and litigate these claims, which impacted our actuarially determined liabilities,\u201d he said.\n\nAs of Tuesday\u2019s close, Dollar Tree\u2019s shares are down nearly 43% so far this year.

{"title": "Fundamentals behind a USA market drop this week & some positives", "selftext": "The problem areas in the USA: --------------------------\n\n\\*- The Schiller PE is at a very high level.  Only higher in 2021 and the Dot Com bubble.  So stocks are highly expensive.\n\n\\*- ISM manufacturing index has been in contraction since mid 2022!  We are more of a service economy than a goods economy,  but still when you have stocks priced for perfection this isn't what you want happening if you are a bull.\n\n\\*-  World's #2 economy, China is no longer growing to the point that it can move the global needle.  That is, global sales growing to the point where a company's local USA sales declines are offset.  Additionally the trade war hampers both sides.\n\n\\*- The consumer's savings have dropped back to 2022 levels.\n\n\\*- NVidia's leadership of the gainers was not sustainable and my one man's opinion is because their valuation is ten times the cash in the bank of all of their AI customers.  You have price to sales of 10 for all the money your customers could possibly spend on anything AI that NVidia sells in the short term.  People have said on this point that future earnings will be available and that customers can go to a bank.  However, clearly the price is high when you compare to say MKS Instruments and Applied Materials.  AMAT has more cash in the bank than MKSI is worth.  AMAT is MKSI's biggest customer, having a disproportionately large percentage of its sales.  So this means that in the short term, there is monetary potential energy for MKSI without loans nor future earnings, but it is not the same potential energy for NVidia.  This is not a marketing of MKSI stock BTW.  I don't own any MKSI.  This point applies to NVidia's AI GPUs that certainly the average person is not affording.  So the cash on hand is from MSFT, GOOG, META, AMZN.\n\nGood areas: --------------------------------------\n\n\\*- Labor productivity is up consistently since Q3 2022.  one can see \n\ntradingeconomics dot com USA productivity\n\n\\*- Gasoline is lower than last year\n\n\\*- Retail sales are going fine, \\[ per  a recent NPR radio article \\]\n\nNuetral ----------------------------------------\n\n\\*- Labor force participation is not higher than Sept 2023.  No more sales growth from people returning to work.  Participation is up recently. tradingeconomics has this info.\n\n\\*- Consumer confidence is still down since January 2020.\n\nMy one man's take ----------------\n\nThe problem areas are serious.  There is enough weight in the bear issues to cause the stock market to give up most of its gains this year.", "id": "1f8htux", "created_utc": 1725415569.0, "score": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 6 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 104 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lz2hh7/oh_what_a_setup_for_gold_warning_bring_your/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17tbat8/stocks_with_good_dividends_without_debt_drag_a/) \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.383919894695282}, {"body": "More words in the bad section.

Think about it, or have you forgotten NFTs and SPACs and shit?  There was a top and we were steadily correcting until shit was reignited. I don't think we've got historic precedent for it. The AI thing is kinda laughable in many ways while being amazing. \nLet's not forget human nature.. Railroads, the internet.. These new big ideas come along and EVERYONE recognizes there's a big change coming. And allll this capital starts chasing it. And it gets stupid. It gets to planning multiple railways between cities, it gets to pets.com . And then it collapses. And then it ACTUALLY develops and becomes worth something over longer time period than those throwing the initial capital would hope.\n\n\nBubble historian Jeremy Grantham notes \n>The final feature of the great superbubbles has been a sustained narrowing of the market and unique underperformance of speculative stocks, many of which fall as the blue chip market rises. This occurred in 1929, in 2000, and it is occurring now. A plausible reason for this effect would be that experienced professionals who know that the market is dangerously overpriced yet feel for commercial reasons they must keep dancing prefer at least to dance off the cliff with safer stocks. This is why at the end of the great bubbles it seems as if the confidence termites attack the most speculative and vulnerable first and work their way up, sometimes quite slowly, to the blue chips.\n\nFrom <https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/let-the-wild-rumpus-begin_viewpoints/> \n\n\n[there is an excellent post from klarman on the psychology at this kinda point in the market and the reason the dancing typically continues - [page 1](https://preview.redd.it/xftkwpaahvmd1.jpeg?auto=webp&s=26a3d7c059cf0b6e27a0ee3dad5a7b1f6f840af4) [and 2](https://preview.redd.it/uj86fmybhvmd1.jpeg?auto=webp&s=4ede5e9d0b924b09fb8a856b2c653e0f077a93a9) \n.\n\ngiven I have shit stoner memory, I dont bother with prices but [just look at market cap](https://preview.redd.it/zcnu79jsevmd1.jpeg?width=1024&auto=webp&s=4a98b5c27b5b517f9fa8c0594b6153f132f66291) \n\n\nSo that's what you're looking for. It's not TSLA to look at today (although by any measure it should take a beating too) but of course anything AI.\n\n\n\nSo those things that make the big running pooping out and then the insitutional guys who cant stop dancing (a reference to musical chairs, expecting music to stop) start going to \"relative\" safety. I say relative like that because this late into bull markets, its pretty fucken common for relative valuation to outweigh discounted cash flow valutation in the minds of many. \n\nAnd today I see this post on twitter: \n\n\nAll these stocks hit new 52 WEEK HIGHS at some point today [1of2](https://preview.redd.it/j8maggt9jvmd1.jpeg?width=550&auto=webp&s=8ed79297e6590f4d82e0c20143e45cd8db74cf67) [2of2](https://preview.redd.it/u8lulnbdjvmd1.jpeg?width=411&auto=webp&s=ab33fdb9c7cf31e7e2eeaee2c388a7b3904a7375)\n\n\n\n>9:52 PM \u00b7 Sep 4, 2024\n>18.3K Views\n\nFrom <https://x.com/StockMKTNewz/status/1831420031143702835> \n\n.\nAnd I'm just sitting thinkinh aaaah shit here we go again.\n\n\n.\n\nBefore you ask, not I am not buying puts. It's not my game. I'm long a few select stocks and will be comfortable holding them through the next few years, market fuckup or not, In the USA I'm only holding BRK.B CROX and ASO .
