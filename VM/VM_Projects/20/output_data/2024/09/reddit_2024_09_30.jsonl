You say you paid $0.95/share per call on Sep 30? \n\nI'm sorry to inform you that you bought at the absolute peak of that contract. Every price before and after your trade is a lower price. Did you by any chance use a market order to open that trade? The spread looks quite wide. The nearest strike with a current bid is the 26 with 0.55/4.80, an absurdly wide spread. Against the current spot price of $28.75. The fact that the bid is so deeply discounted vs. the intrinsic value of the 26 call is not a good sign.\n\nSo long story short, it appears that you overpaid for a very illiquid contract. There's not much you can do about it now, but on the bright side, you at least have a shot at breaking even, if the current price goes up just a little more by expiration.\n\nYour two choices are (a) cut your losses and try to dump the contracts now, which would require a lot of patience since there is currently no bid on that contract, or (b) wait until expiration and see if you can't recover a bit more of your investment. You may have to exercise, although there would be no point if the share price is stubbornly below your break-even.\n\nIn future, here are some things to look out for:\n\n* Avoid contracts that only have monthly expirations\n\n* Avoid contracts that average close to 0 daily volume\n\n* Avoid contracts that have bid/ask spreads greater than 10% of the bid at the ATM strike\n\nSo if the ATM call has a bid of $2.00/$2.10, you are good to go, since the spread is only $.10 wide and 10% of the bid is $.20, so $.10 is less than $.20 and the spread is acceptable. If however the spread were $2.00/$2.69, you should avoid the entire chain (all strikes of that expiration).\n\nFinally, a reminder that the break-even price only matters if you plan to exercise at expiration: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourbe", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Okay.

In the last hour of trading, SPY was creeping up, and in fact in the last five minutes of trading, it went above your 573 short strike.\n\nNow, neither Robinhood nor you can predict the future.  They didn't know SPY was going to dip back down.  So they have to consider what happens if it stays where it is or goes up.  If SPY had been between 573 and 574 at expiration, you would get assigned on your short 573 calls, while your long 574 calls would expire worthless.  You would sell 25,000 shares of SPY short at 573.  The first problem with that is that Robinhood doesn't allow short-selling of stock, so they are not going to allow that to happen.\n\nBut what if you'd been with Fidelity or Schwab?  On Schwab, short-selling 25,000 shares of SPY at its closing price Friday would take $18.6M in buying power.  Of course, you'd get $14.3M in cash, so the net buying power reduction would \"only\" be in the neighborhood of $7.1M, but unless you are already rich, that would place you in huge margin call.

OH facility](https://preview.redd.it/umc8trpzuzrd1.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=d56d123b3020d0da0bfde8c0d69585aa948a59ba)\n\n**The Core of the Thesis**\n\nI believe Centrus Energy Corp (LEU) offers the greatest upside in the Nuclear sector. Here\u2019s why:\n\n-\u00a0LEU is the only American company that enriches uranium today.\n\n-\u00a0It currently trades at 2.2x enterprise value / sales. It reported 189m of revenues last quarter.\n\nLets compare that valuation to the uranium miners. Of the one\u2019s producing revenue, they average \\~97x. If we reduce the comparison to the lowest, it is 10x. If you want to compare to the largest and most well-known, it is CCJ at 11x. Suffice to say, nuclear-related companies trade at very high multiples.\n\nMaybe they should be trading more in like with utilities with nuclear exposure. Well even here, the average is 5x.\n\n\u00a0The basic metrics for LEU and comparisons are below.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8lff6y73tzrd1.png?width=933&format=png&auto=webp&s=14eb43fc2ce5763e231a34873cd3699ce9869a58\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qgxfjb9kszrd1.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=9193bcfeba5278761e75ed692d49d9ca20da72d6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jrbs7jkoszrd1.png?width=437&format=png&auto=webp&s=99de7d1637a38361112ecfc18f62687a2f246afe\n\n**Potential for Outsized Returns**\n\nIf LEU simply re-rates to \\~5x \u2013 which to me, would still be very conservatively valued \u2013 it would be \\~123 / share. January 80 strikes currently trade at \\~1.7. If that re-rate happened before then, the return would be \\~25x. I.e. (123 \u2013 80) / 1.7.\n\nThose kind of potential returns are exceptionally rare, even among contracts.\n\nI am not aware of any other nuclear related trades that could offer such an enormous return. Never mind such an enormous return on a relatively conservative premise, i.e. re-rating from \\~2.2 ev / sales to 5x.\n\nSo now that we have the most important elements out of the way, here is why I think Nuclear will be super hot, and more details on LEU specifically.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**US Nuclear Bull Thesis**\n\nAI is viewed by the Mag7-Military-Inudustial complex as being central to US political and economic hegemony. As such, they have pulled out all stops in terms expenditures. And the feds have operated at breakneck spread to buttress US advantage in AI via regulation. I.e. they have acted swiftly and aggressively to being as much of the supply chain within US national borders or control.\n\nAs AI has progressed, anything that has been revealed to be a bottleneck \u2013 whether semis, or data centers with ready powers supplies, or electrical companies, etc. has re-rated, often doubling, tripling, or more in breakneck speed.\n\nThe latest revealed bottleneck is energy. And apparently nuclear power is the only source that can viably satiate the projected energy needs. Hence the MSFT big for three mile island. I view this as the opening salvo. The other big AI players will need to secure nuclear sites in short order \u2013 perhaps they will be bidding against one another \u2013 given the limited number of existing nuclear sites. The news cycle for Nuclear is primed to get wild, and fast.\n\n[From Centrus Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/h324mgwptzrd1.png?width=1523&format=png&auto=webp&s=e41640e6343ace47c1ead089327134cee30923ee)\n\n**LEUs role**\n\nThe US\u2019s largest vulnerability with respect to nuclear is that much of the supply chain is controlled by Russia. Given that (a) we are engaged with a proxy war with Russia, and (b) rapidly expanding nuclear power is now a major national security issue \u2013 I expect the Feds to act rapidly and decisively to remedy this issue.\n\nThe most obvious step to remedy this would be to provide substantial funding to support LEU\u2019s expansion of enrichment facilities within the US. When it comes to acting decisively and rapidly \u2013 the Feds almost always bet big on the most established players with the longest history. That is unambiguously LEU.\n\nBeyond the feds taking action, I think the Mag7 / utilities are going to be placing massive orders to secure future enriched uranium, as it becomes evident the number of active nuclear sites in the US is set to expand. LEU should be a recipient of much of these orders and see their backlog increase substantially. In sum, I think LEU is primed for a series of very positive press releases and generally a very bullish news cycle with respect to nuclear energy.\n\n[From Centrus Investor Presentation](https://preview.redd.it/nqfpuftktzrd1.png?width=1521&format=png&auto=webp&s=2589d749e180e841a56e128b814bb86fea259545)\n\n**Further Info**\n\nThere is plenty of other reasons to be bullish LEU, e.g. their strong relationships with SMR developers and the work they are doing with HALEU. However, I will end it here. If there is interest, I'll do a follow-up post. In the meantime if you want to dive further\n\nI suggest this video or a presentation the CEO just gave in DC.\n\n[https://x.com/centrus\\_energy/status/1838732746962743484](https://x.com/centrus_energy/status/1838732746962743484)\n\nTheir investor presentation is here\n\n[https://investors.centrusenergy.com/static-files/058b474a-c135-4600-a84b-e9908864a7a](https://investors.centrusenergy.com/static-files/058b474a-c135-4600-a84b-e9908864a7a)\n\n**Disclosure**  \nIn sum, I think conditions are perfect for the re-rate I described above.\n\nI am long LEU commons and calls of various strikes and expiry dates.", "id": "1ft3itl", "created_utc": 1727722745.0, "score": 60, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 44, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 4 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 8 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ft3itl/leu_the_fat_pitch_for_a_us_uranium_enrichment/) \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4415000081062317}, {"body": "What if their Russian supplier pulls back because of uranium export ban causing LEU to second source at less economical terms?

If we want exposure to nuclear, we have to consider the alternatives - and the alternatives are companies worth many billions with massive cash burn rates and practically no revenue.\n\nIf LEU margins got temporarily crushed - they would still have better metrics than every miner and SMR developer.

I was doing spreads mostly (and some scalps), but after getting flagged only scalping cuz no more spreads. I tried rolling my own spreads but that\u2019s where I really lost it (woke up late and one leg didn\u2019t go through, so I was really over exposed directionally and lost a lot since the market moved directionally a ton that day). Unfortunately that was the day I had the most exposed to the market, I was practicing hedging. I didn\u2019t intend to have that much exposed as it was intended to be hedged with a max loss, so I lost more than I ever intended too. Like 50%.\n\nNot being able to do spreads and having to do cash settlement just really threw me off, and losing money at the same time didn\u2019t help. Almost bounced back but then blew it in a Costco earnings call like a regard. What I\u2019m trying to do now is find a catalyst (earnings, gov\u2019t contracts, etc) and enter the position (ideally getting a good entry with low IV), close before the event (or hold if I\u2019ve got conviction). Pretty basic but it\u2019s better than my desperate scramble I was doing before. For example I\u2019m long ZIM right now with strike coming up and Israel-Lebanon war driving up shipping prices. Strike + war will hopefully bring up both price of the underlying and IV. If it goes well I was gonna pick up a position in RCAT too, they have a contract speculatively being awarded late October. Trying to stay ahead of the market on macro narratives and just be patient. Also screening for stocks with high relative volume to investigate daily. \n\n\nI\u2019ve thought about scalping again but this time with a better awareness of when IV is highest intra day (drops off around 11-1 and sometimes picks back up EOD). So buy the position 11-1 when IV is low, sell when IV is high and the position is deeper ITM. Just have to stay ahead of theta decay. I think it just took me a bit to chill out and come out of the shell shock of massive losses and adapting to new strategies and cash settlement.
