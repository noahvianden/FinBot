I read an article today that said the above.\nhttps://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/best-case-scenario-stock-market-outlook-fed-rate-cut-ms-2024-9\n\nWhat exactly is the bond pricing indicating and how is it understood?\n\nAll I understand so far is that GDP growth isn't too bad and the 10Y-2Y yield curve uninverted recently indicating that recession probabilities are low.\n\nHow do I decipher additional insights based on bond prices?", "id": "1fj5i0a", "created_utc": 1726594622.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "Don't look at bond prices. Look at the yields across the Treasury curve. All rates are trending downward, indicating that interest rate cuts by the Fed will be much more than this first cut that's about to happen. \n\nGDP is a known faulty indicator, especially in economic downturns. In 2008, GDP in the first two quarters was positive and, since then, has been revised down and is now shown as negative.\n\nThe two- and ten-year yield curve inversion doesn't indicate that the recession is less likely; the recession has just begun, and the Fed hasn't yet gotten the memo. It's also good to look at all yields across the curve. The two year have gone below the 10-year. But look at the one year, as it also attempts to trend down. It has uninverted vs. the 20-year and seems to be trying to go for the 30-year, too. \n\nThe bond market indicates that monetary policy is behind the curve, which relates to those who bet in the bond market, who tend to see bond yields as an early indicator of what the Fed will do. The implication of being behind the curve is rates are trending lower, signaling lower growth and inflation expectations. Everyone is saying that because the yield curve has been inverted for so long, it's wrong, but that isn't how this works. Bond yields signal lower growth and inflation expectations, which we have seen. The recession signal is the uninversion after yield curves have been inverted. As it moves along the front end of the curve close to T-Bills, where the Fed has much more sway in the interest rate, it confirms the same. The Bond market tends to think they have control of the monetary system, and most people in the stock market think the Fed controls the monetary system. However, if you look at the Fed funds rate and the 2-year yield, it does look like the bond market is ahead of the Fed. Right now, it's ahead of the Fed in terms of how much it expects to cut. \n\nLow interest rates are a bad signal, even though it makes money in the bond market. I should also mention the uninversion of the 2 and 10 year in history had occurred before the date of a recession was called; in 2007, it was over a year after the uninversion that in Dec 2008, the recession was called by the NBER. It was set to begin in December 2007, when the 2 and 10 years uninverted in May 2007. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y/", "score": 21, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession", "inflation", "gdp"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Bonds have been behind the curve for 3 years.

What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it.

All around a great post!\n\nHere are examples of what could get your post removed:\n\n* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help.
