{"title": "Possibly The Most Effective Way to Sell Theta.", "selftext": "Am testing outside of earning's potential strategies, there's something which has worked extremely well which am going to keep trialing. It uses cheap contract costs, captures directional movement, and sells high amounts of Theta.\n\n1. NVDA earning's release, after IV crush in the morning opened Strangle $100p/$150c (9/27). Price was near $120.\n2. After price runs enough to one side begin to sell near ATM covered calls/puts capturing huge premium and a big directional move.\n3. For example, NVDA $100p was $90 to open, worth $2.60 now. When NVDA price was $106 yesterday, sold the $104p for a $144 premium.\n\nThe $100p cost was $90, increased by nearly 200%, then sold near ATM put paying what's $70 a day; the cost to open the call side was $80. I can now continue to sell weeklies near $102-$104 price, cannot deviate too far from $100 strike or risk spread loss. I can open $103 next, selling next week which'll pay $220. $54 dollars a day for a month from something which originally cost me just $90 to open.\n\nDidn't realize it but now I can see massive 500%-800% returns from a contract *if can continue selling weeklies on one side.* More importantly, I can now open the $120c (10/04) for $220, if the price recovers in the next week I can now capture the move and begin to sell covered calls, or keep selling covered puts if price remains flat. Having multiple Strangles to leave some open ended & sell various strikes would work best.\n\n**CONCLUSION**: The point is to keep selling covered calls/puts, opened originally with a Strangle immediately post-earning's release to avoid IV crush, but yet still capture much of the post earning's reaction movement, which will help us reach one side of the Strangle to start aggressively selling. After the first sold covered call/put, can open on the other side at a new better price. *The positions must be closed 2 weeks prior to next ER or face IV expansion which makes selling near Theta impossible.*", "id": "1f9yowu", "created_utc": 1725573413.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "The key is to sell beta.

The ecconomy plainly isn't currently in recession, as none of the [NBER indicators](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/dashboard/84408) yet really indicates a peak, apart from the industrial production index recently looking flat.  \n\nAnd with it being more than a year now since the last Fed rate hike, and with the Fed now ready to loosen by a quarter point, we've likely already seen nearly all the slowing as we'll see from the Fed's tightening cycle. \n\nAnd there aren't really any significant leading indicators of recession anymore that I can see, other than a slight weakening of labor markets, with unemployment having risen to 4.3%. But that pretty much right at the [non-cyclical rate of unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NROU) as estimated by the CBO, the rate their model says is sustainable without continuing problems with inflation, which we no longer seem to have. \n\nAnd given the improvement we've seen in the inflation numbers, even if labor markets were to deteriorate further, and the unemployment rate were to rise more than necessary, the Fed would be well positioned to quickly cut rates here to counter that.", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Don't worry, Uber and Lyft will still be hiring.
