Sounds like a skill you should work on. Here is the best way I can frame it... You will experience four kinds of trades, and every trade will end up with one of these four categories. Your goal is simply to eliminate one of them. That's it.\n\n**- Big Win:** few and far between, but just a few of these can make up a big portion of your overall gains, let them come, enjoy them. Don't prevent them from happening by selling small wins too early if it goes against your thesis  \n**- Small Win:** This is likely the trade you see the most. Its probably what you're aiming for in almost every trade, steady small profits. You want this to make up most of your trades (going for only Big Wins can have a lot of hidden dangers)  \n**- Small Loss (or break even):** These happen often, but hopefully less than small wins. They are perfectly ok. You should appreciate them for what they are...   \n**- Big Loss:** A trade can never become this, without first being a small loss. If a small loss is on a trajectory to this category, you have full control over aborting before it enters this category.\n\nIt is worth repeating. With proper risk management, you will NEVER experience a big loss that didn't grow from a small loss. You can stop every single big loss from happening by accepting it as a small loss before it gets there.\n\nI hope this helps frame your mindset... you don't want small losses to make up a majority of your trades, but if accepting 30% or even 50% of your trades as small losses, prevents you from having a single big loss... your small wins and big wins will make your profitable in the long run.\n\nThis idea is so obvious on the surface, but the challenge in implementing it is to recognize... you can cut losses before they compound. Move on. If you find yourself obsessing over your green streaks, of lamenting the account size a day or week prior while you're in a downtrend... you need to just accept that overtime you will always fluctuate up and down... your goal is to be more up than done... not only up, all the time.

He estimated that fulfilling his promise of higher import tariffs could reduce German exports to the US by 15%.\n\nThe automotive and pharmaceutical industries would be particularly hard hit, where export losses would reach a third.\n\nTrump announced that if re-elected, he would impose an additional 60% tariff on imports from China and a 20% tariff on imports from the rest of the world. German products would therefore be significantly more expensive in the USA.\n\nMoreover, much higher US tariffs on Chinese imports would likely reduce demand for manufactured goods in China, which would also be felt by German exporters.\n\nContext:\n\nThe new Ifo study only looked at the expected direct effects of the increase in US tariffs.
