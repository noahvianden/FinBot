{"title": "Berkshire unloads another chunk of Bank of America as CEO lauds Buffett ", "selftext": "Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway offloaded another chunk of Bank of America shares, bringing its total sales to more than $7 billion since mid-July and reducing its stake to 11%.\n\nThe Omaha-based conglomerate shed a total of 5.8 million BofA shares in separate sales on Friday, Monday and Tuesday for almost $228.7 million at an average selling price of $39.45 per share, according to a new regulatory filing.\n\nThe latest action extended Berkshire\u2019s selling streak to 12 consecutive sessions, matching the 12 consecutive sessions from July 17 to Aug. 1.\n\nBerkshire has sold more than 174.7 million shares of the Charlotte-based bank for $7.2 billion, with 858.2 million shares remaining, or 11.1% of shares outstanding. BofA has fallen to the No.3 spot on Berkshire\u2019s list of top holdings, trailing behind Apple and American Express. Before the selling spree, BofA had long been Berkshire\u2019s second biggest holding.\n\nMoynihan on Buffett\n\nBuffett famously bought $5 billion worth of BofA\u2019s preferred stock and warrants in 2011 in the aftermath of the financial crisis. He converted those warrants in 2017, making Berkshire the largest shareholder in BofA. The \u201cOracle of Omaha\u201d then added 300 million more shares to his bet around 2018 and 2019.\n\nBofA CEO Brian Moynihan made a rare comment about Berkshire\u2019s sales Tuesday, saying he has no knowledge of Buffett\u2019s motivation for selling.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what exactly he\u2019s doing, because frankly, we can\u2019t ask him. We wouldn\u2019t ask,\u201d he said during Barclays Global Financial Services Conference, according to a transcript on FactSet. \u201cBut on the other hand, the market\u2019s absorbing the stock .... we\u2019re buying a portion of the stock, and so life will go on.\u201d\n\nShares of BofA have dipped just about 1% since the start of July, and the stock is up 16.7% this year, slightly outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nMoynihan, who has been leading the bank since 2010, praised the 94-year-old\u2019s shrewd investment in his bank in 2011, which helped shore up confidence in the embattled lender struggling with losses tied to subprime mortgages.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been a great investor for our company, and stabilized our company when we needed at the time,\u201d he said.\n\nTo illustrate how lucrative Buffett\u2019s investment has been, Moynihan said if investors were to buy his bank stock the same day Buffett did, they would have been able to capture the low price of $5.50 per share. The stock last traded just under $40 apiece.\n\n\u201cHe just had the guts to do it in a big way. And he did it. And it\u2019s been a fabulous return for him. We\u2019re happy that he gets it,\u201d Moynihan said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/11/berkshire-unloads-another-chunk-of-bank-of-america-as-ceo-moynihan-lauds-buffett-as-great-shareholder.html", "id": "1fecz50", "created_utc": 1726068537.0, "score": 285, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "What people forget is that Mr. Buffett and his team has more data at their disposal than the average investor.
