{"title": "Google wins court challenge to the EU's $1.7 billion antitrust fine over ad product ", "selftext": "The European Union\u2019s second-highest court on Wednesday said a 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) fine imposed on Google by regulators should be annulled, siding with the U.S. tech giant after it challenged the ruling.\n\nThe case stems from 2019 when the European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, said Alphabet owned Google had abused its market dominance in relation to a product called AdSense for Search. This product allowed website owners to deliver ads into the search results on their own pages.\n\nGoogle acts as an intermediary allowing advertisers to serve ads via search on third-party websites.\n\nBut the commission alleged that Google abused its market dominance by imposing a number of restrictive clauses in contracts with third-party websites, which ultimately prevented rivals from placing their search ads on these websites.\n\nThe commission fined Google 1.49 billion euros at the time. Google appealed, sending the case to the EU\u2019s General Court.\n\nThe General Court said Wednesday that it \u201cupholds the majority of the findings\u201d but \u201cannuls the decision by which the Commission imposed a fine of\u201d nearly 1.5 billion euros.\n\nThe court added that the commission \u201cfailed to take into consideration all the relevant circumstances in its assessment of the duration of the contract clauses\u201d that it had deemed abusive.\n\nA Google spokesperson told CNBC that it would review the full decision closely.\n\n\u201cThis case is about a very narrow subset of text-only search ads placed on a limited number of publishers\u2019 websites. We made changes to our contracts in 2016 to remove the relevant provisions, even before the Commission\u2019s decision. We are pleased that the court has recognized errors in the original decision and annulled the fine,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nA spokesperson for the commission said it takes note of the judgement and will reflect on the possible next steps.\n\nThe commission could appeal this decision which would send it up to European Court of Justice, the EU\u2019s top court.\n\nThere has been a slew of court cases involving the EU and U.S. tech companies reaching their conclusions recently.\n\nThis month, the ECJ upheld a 2.4 billion euro fine imposed on Google for abusing its dominant position by favoring its own shopping comparison service. And the same court ruled that Apple must pay 13 billion euros in back taxes to Ireland, ending a decade-long case.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/18/court-backs-googles-challenge-to-the-eus-1point7-billion-antitrust-fine.html", "id": "1fjup5y", "created_utc": 1726671030.0, "score": 229, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "If the EU isn't substantially pinching Google, I don't think the US DOJ has a shot in hell.", "score": 96, "replies": [{"body": "I find joy in reading a good book.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Prob bc they are..", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I'm learning to play the guitar.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.03605706989765167}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.08719255030155182}, {"body": "\"Pretty sure\", GOOG has better lawyers and more cards up their sleeve.\u00a0", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "I enjoy cooking.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah what is that assumption lol", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04553234577178955}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.021139927208423615}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.10358186066150665}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.026750067248940468}, {"body": "I saw a Eric Schmidt, Ex-google CEO, and he talked about the upcoming information war with chin and his lobbying case in favor of google in Europe.

Aside from India and China, I don't really see these countries having any significant impact on the global economy except for destabilizing it.  And China has its own internal issues that it is wrestling with.  Russia is absolutely wrecked; they've set themselves back a generation -- at least.\n\nDon't get me wrong; I am anti-militarization and anti-war, but it also has real consequences from an economic and technological perspective.\n\nThe downfall of the US won't be from militarization or BRICS, it'll be from an inability to do the most basic of responsible economic policy: **raising taxes**.  Conservatives keep wanting to to go back to the 50's.  Part of what made it work was that there was far less income inequality and the top individual tax rate peaked at 92%. Corporate tax rates were as high as 52.8% in the 50's.\n\nSo much of what's wrong with the US at the moment can be fixed if we raised taxes.  I'm not advocating for a level of taxation that matches the 50's, but we could easily fund Social Security and have world class universal healthcare if we wanted to by simply raising taxes (and legislation to address excessive corporate tax sheltering and loopholes).", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Well put.
