{"title": "Post-Earnings Analysis of My Recommended Trade, DOCU, From Yesterday (Wed 6 Mar 2024)", "selftext": "Hi, Geeks.\n\nYesterday, I posted a market analysis and recommended trade on DOCU:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1b7xpko/premarket\\_preparation\\_and\\_trade\\_entry/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1b7xpko/premarket_preparation_and_trade_entry/)\n\nI suggested both a conservative shorted put spread trade on DOCU and a more aggressive long call trade, striking at $55.00/share.\n\nAfter releasing earnings today, DOCU beat expectations:\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/docusigns-sterling-quarter-pushes-its-stock-up-15-67e0fba8](https://www.marketwatch.com/amp/story/docusigns-sterling-quarter-pushes-its-stock-up-15-67e0fba8)\n\nAs of 4:50 pm EST, DOCU is trading above $60.00/share after hours. I hope that many of you were able to get in on the trade and profit.\n\nWhat I'd like to talk about in this post, though, is a lot more important: the trade that I recommended avoiding, MDB, because of the awful reward-to-risk. I pointed out that it was significantly overvalued. MDB closed at $412.01/share today (Thursday, 7 Mar 2024). After reporting earnings, it crashed and is trading around $354.25/share after hours, a decline of 14%.\n\nRegardless of whether you trade earnings using options, swing trade shares, or invest for the long term, it's really important to know the fair value of a company. This is a complicated dark art and based on (usually reasonable) assumptions, often within the context of a persistently irrational market. That said, it really helps to know that you're considering paying $412.01/share for something worth $268.80/share. (It's not quite this simple, but the important point is that valuation always matters, and chasing hype and momentum can annihilate you if you're not very careful\u2014and lucky.)\n\nWhen you try to design successful trades, I urge you to always check how much a company is roughly worth. A 10-year DCF model can give you a reasonable idea. Most of the time, most companies, especially growth companies in tech, trade vastly higher than their fair value, but being able to look at the fair value, and where the current share price is relative to it, helps to give you an idea of just how much risk you'd be taking on, which is a valuable piece of information, since most of our job as traders involves managing (preferably avoiding) risk.\n\nWhat's the easy way to do this?\n\nUse [finbox.com](https://finbox.com). For example, to see MDB's fair value, go here:\n\n[https://finbox.com/NASDAQGM:MDB/models/dcf-growth-exit-10yr/](https://finbox.com/NASDAQGM:MDB/models/dcf-growth-exit-10yr/)\n\nYou can look up any company. It's a quick and dirty way of making sure that you're not about to do something crazy. :)\n\nI hope this helps, and good luck in your trading journey.\n\nArtem", "id": "1b96wg6", "created_utc": 1709849109.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "Tha k you, I bought one call $57 exp 3/15 today before lunch.\n\n\nAny other moves on your radar for tomorrow?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "You're welcome.\n\nI only trade when I can find an edge, and most of my trades last one week to one month.

It can be hard to apply them to a small and quickly growing company because modeling valuation depends on assumptions about the future that we're only guessing about. It's very different if you have a mature dividend-yielding company.

In other cases, it's useless, such as with a clinical stage biotechs in Phase II trials. These companies are generally (highly) unprofitable, burning up cash like there's no tomorrow, and yet, one of them could wind up curing a form of cancer or defeating Alzheimer's disease.\n\nWith these companies, it's impossible to rely on financials. CRSP is a good example. The actual worth of the company is speculative, unknown, and unknowable, but the potential is breathtaking. In these cases, you try to rely on other metrics to assess value, but it's a wild guessing game. Ultimately, the value is determined by investors, who, themselves, are hoping and guessing about the unknowable future.\n\nEven where financial metrics make sense, it's just not that straightforward. A good example is PLTR. Financially, it's jaw-droppingly overvalued, but it's dead center in the dominant theme driving the market, AI, which seems poised to transform every aspect of our lives if its potential is ubiquitously realized. A theme, or story, can override financial considerations. You also have to deal with the pervasive problem of greed or panic that leads to completely irrational share prices utterly disconnected from fundamentals for long periods of time.\n\nAnd I haven't even said anything about the Fed's monetary policy. Sometimes, no one cares. That's the default case. Other times, for years on end, everyone hangs on every word that the Fed's chairman says, and analysts pay body language experts money to analyze subtle gestures to try to determine what he \"really\" means! (I don't blame them; the stakes are enormous for all of us.)\n\nI've never found a consistent process that could be applied to all companies. It feels like a treasure hunt every single time, and it occurs within the context of the overall market and economy, the conditions of which can change dramatically over time, and then change back; it's like sailing on a ship, with unpredictable storms and bedazzling vistas. I hate to burst any financial accountant's bubble, but finance is an art based more on imagination and hope than hard data, which probably explains why accountants and financiers don't tend to like one another very much. :)\n\nTL;DR: I look at a lot of different things. It varies for each company. It's profoundly influenced by the (often shifting) broader market and macroeconomic contexts. And the result is usually frustratingly ambiguous and causes me to move on and try again (and again, and again and again).\n\nAs someone once said, \"The guardians of truth are paradox and confusion.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, we're all just guessing.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hah I\u2019m glad I came back to copy that finbox link or I would have missed this, thanks for the write up!

In general, it is *much* more difficult to win bearish than bullish plays. This is primarily for two reasons.\n\nFirst, when everyone is scared, they want to hedge. But when everyone is trying to buy put contracts, they become expensive because of the law of supply and demand. Another way of putting this is that IV skyrockets, and the cost of puts is so high that you need to have a large crash just to break even! So, if you buy put contracts, you need to get both the magnitude and timing right, and that's usually far from obvious. But even if you're right about the direction and timing, you could still lose money because the underlying fails to drop sufficiently to pay back the price you had to pay to buy expensive puts.\n\nSecond, as Warren Buffett points out, the market can stay irrational far longer than you can stay solvent. Just because MDB was severely overvalued didn't mean that it couldn't go higher, even much higher. After all, PLTR is severely overvalued, but has been a moon rocket since May of last year. \n\nGiven these problems, and some less important considerations, it's just much safer to only make bullish bets. It's a lot less stressful, and the ease and probability of winning goes way up. Also, don't forget that the market goes up, not down, over time. All of these factors wind up working against you. You have to be right about so many things to profit on bearish bets. I try to avoid making them, and even when I do, I always use a very small position size.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nArtem", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I did help thank you.
