To prevent drivers from getting stranded as their predicted range started declining more quickly, Teslas were designed with a \u201csafety buffer,\u201d allowing about 15 miles (24 km) of additional range even after the dash readout showed an empty battery, the source said.\n\n> The directive to present the optimistic range estimates came from Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, this person said.\n\nThe issue isn't that people don't meet the range estimates, it is that the company knew the estimates were complete bullshit but rigged the software to display higher numbers to dupe people.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6840488910675049}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4942064881324768}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5354295969009399}, {"body": "Is every single car manufacturer selling vehicles in Europe committing fraud, because vehicles often don\u2019t achieve the WLTP range?
