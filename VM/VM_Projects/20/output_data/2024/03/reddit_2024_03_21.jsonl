{"title": "Taking advantage of VXX decay", "selftext": "VXX is an etf that tracks a rolling basket of vix futures. It is an insurance product with a built in decay that makes it a terrible long term hold. I am trying to come up with an options strategy to take advantage of this long term decay, while also keeping losses somewhere tolerable.\n\nMy plan is to use Put Debit Spreads to take advantage of this downward movement.\n\n\n**What I know**\n\n\nVXX has a tendency to drift lower over time. It has a decay rate of about 5.1% per month, as per VTS (Volatility Trading Stategies. I have not calculated this number my self, but it passes the smell test. Vix futures are usually in contango, so most of the time, shorting vxx is a good trade.\n\nMy Strategy would be to maintain some short exposure to the VXX by using Put Debit Spreads. I know that liquidity will be a little bit lower for Put Debit spreads, versus call credit spreads, but for me the math is just a little bit easier. VXX tends to have weekly options so I'm thinking about opening a weekly Put debit spread about 5 weeks out and opening up a new position each week, as long as vix is in contango. Backwardation would mean a pause in the strategy.\n\n\n**What I don't know**\n\nMy biggest question about this strategy comes down to position sizing and profit target. I know that I don't want to risk too much in any individual trade, but I also don't want to have positions so small that the profit target doesn't make the work worth while. \n\nI am familiar with expected value. It basically boils down to the avg size of your wins times winning percentage minus avg loss time losing percentage equals expected value.\n\nSo this is where I seek the wisdom of the hive mind. I need to know what would be an appropriate position size for a trade like this. How do you go about setting up a good profit target?\n\n**A First Draft of a Trading Strategy**\n\nMy gut tells me a 2% position size per trade would be a decent place to start. At any given time, you would have a total of 10% of your capital tied up. If VXX explodes, then I'm out 10% of my portfolio and wait for contango. I looked at the price of the ATM put spreads, and a dollar wide spread expiring a month out is .60. If I was to wait all the way til expiration, that would leave me with a profit of 66%. If I have a portfolio of 3k, then a 60 dollar wide debit spread would fit perfectly. As my portfolio grows I could slowly increase the size of my positions, either going wider, or doing more spreads.\n\nIf I have 10% of my portfolio in this strategy at any given time, and all 5 trades were to be profitable, that would amount to about 6% per month, and nearly 100% annualized. Now I know that this is not realistic. If the max profit on a .60 debit spread is .40, would shooting for .15 or 25% max profit be an appropriate target? \n\nHow does one go about back testing something like this? My biggest concern is I can make a guess as to what a good position size could be, but I have next to know idea what the win rate would be. I know that back testing would be the way to go, but if I'm being honest, I would rather find something free. The win rate and the size of the winners versus the size of the losers will make or break a strategy like this. I'm aware that commissions will also factor into my trading, and can turn a winning strategy into a loser.\n\nAlright reddit, if you made it this far, what am I missing?", "id": "1bkdkv5", "created_utc": 1711045618.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "Have you back tested this?
