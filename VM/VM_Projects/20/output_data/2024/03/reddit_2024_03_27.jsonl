I placed a single trade on 1 share of KHC and was able to purchase with no issues, despite having negative BP.\n\nTakeaway: Schwab MMF seems to work suitably well for Schwab traders, however if your account is marginable then you may end up paying 1 day of margin if things don't clear in 1 day.

I'm just wondering if it's even worth moving cash back and forth between SWVXX if you end up having to pay margin interest when you get assigned.
