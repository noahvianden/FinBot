Most of these \"customers building AI chips\" are not the same thing as what NVidia is building. To run the AIs you mostly need a ton of bandwidth, memory and a neural processing chip, essentially the calculation part of the chip only needs to do \\`(a \\* b) + c\\` where each of those is a very large matrix.\n\nHowever, on the training side it's much different. There you have to process the input data, run the AI, then figure out what went wrong, walk it backwards and tweak the variables so they are should produce a better output then do it again, this is the learning part of machine learning. This latter part is 100% NVidia's wheelhouse, the big problem here is it's not just running a large matrix multiplication it's about having to feed that hardware with correctly structured data (the CPU's part of the job), the distribution of the data (networking and clustering parts of the cluster), etc. And unlike most companies, no one has the combination of CPU/GPU/NPU/DPU tech \\*and\\* all the software to do all of that in-house. Looking back on it, NVidia's aquisition of Mellanox was huge for this.\n\nSo far, every single claim I've seen of someone saying \"we have a chip that's 10x faster than a H100\" has only gone and slapped a ton of silicon on a chip that does nothing but matrix multiplication. Sure that'll make some stupid fast inferencing tech, but that's the easy thing to make, the training is where all the money is going, and that's what no other company comes close to NVidia on. AMD would like to think they're close, but even then they only have the CPU/GPU bits and not a ton of solutions for network processing, secondary accelerators, and infrastructure.\n\nNVidia certainly isn't invincible, but no one is catching them soon.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Admittedly I'm not intimately familiar with hardware, but I've trained ML models (including LLMs) and I'm slightly confused by your statements, so if you clarify I'd appreciate it. The \"correctly structured data\" portion that you mentioned is part of the data preprocessing stage on CPUs, which tends to be several orders of magnitude faster than the actual training itself, and thus is not generally a bottle-neck in the process. As for the distribution of the data, it is true that moving data can be very expensive, but it isn't compute? (Unless you're talking about something else like inter-chip communication - NVLink?) It is also true that training backward pass is a different kind of computation, but is also essentially matrix multiplication (although yes, the optimal hardware is different than that for inference).\n\nAnyway even though I'm (also) a Software Engineer, I'm an investor. Nvidia's largest customers are the hyperscalers, they're the ones driving growth, and for them to continue to buy Nvidia, their own hardware has to not only be worse, but lag by more than Nvidia's margins. So they don't even have to excel in performance but only have to close the gap just enough.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry I didn't reply to this earlier, it's been a busy week. \n\n  \nIn general the differences between the types of hardware are a tradeoff between flexibility and performance. GPUs are very good at highly parallel tasks, and perform poorly of work isn't grouped into \"warps\" of 32 threads. That is to say, you need to find algorithms that can operate on large chunks of data with all the threads taking the same branches through the code. \n\nOne of the first areas where this falls apart is in data compression. Text data (like that used for LLMs) compresses very well via algorithms like LZ4 or the like, but compressing and decompressing that data is mostly a single threaded process. Sure you can chunk up the data and decompress it in lots of blocks, but then compression suffers.\n\nWhere this comes into play is that, to over generalize, training data involves loading your dataset into memory and feeding it into algorithms that want to do a bit of a (m\\*n) algorithm where every sample is tested against every other sample. This isn't exactly correct, but the problem somewhat the same, in order to train 100 images, you are going to need to feed all 100 through the network, tweak it, then do all 100 again. This works great if you have a ton of RAM, but if not, well then you got to stream into and out of the GPU. \n\nOne strength that NVidia has is the NVLink, which is more than just fast networking, it essentially wires all the nodes of the cluster together at the lowest level. With CUDA it's possible to have one GPU read data from the memory of another GPU in another box, in another rack, in the same cluster. \n\nSo doing that sort of networking naturally means you need a solid network that isn't bottlenecking any of the communication in the system. At these speeds CPUs become limited in their processing, so there's DPUs which are like networking co-processors that process the data. \n\nOn top of all that, if you're building a cluster that you want to allow multiple clients to use at once, you want all that data encrypted and partitioned so no one's program is reading from anyone elses. \n\nSo putting it all together we have: \n\nNPU - Tensor cores that do the matrix multipl operations at the guts of AI  \nGPU - Chips with 20,000 cores, but each core runs slowly and isn't good at programs with lots of branches (if statement). These are used to batch process data, do edge detection on images, really anything that can be done in bulk and isn't a matrix multiply  \nCPU - Chips with fewer (64) cores, but excel at highly branching logic, like compression, or anything where the next chunk of data depends on the previous chunk of data\n\nDPU - Networking co-processors (sometimes with their own OS) or perhaps FPGAs that handle network data compression, routing, encryption etc. So you can say \"get this data from this node\" and it just shows up in memory without having to tell the CPU to do the work  \nNVLink - a networking system that's like Infiniband, but with a ton of NVidia stuff added in to allow all the above to act like one unified computer. So you don't have 100 nodes with 1TB of RAM each, you have 100TB of RAM, some of it is just slower to access.  \n  \nSo when I look at the competitiors, they are all attacking 2-3 parts of that stack, but no one really has an answer for all of it, and certainly no one has the software like CUDA to unify all of it together.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the detailed response. I can\u2019t say that anything you\u2019ve said is false. But there are more considerations to be taken into account.\n\nIt is likely true that Nvidia has the best & most comprehensive accelerated computing solution on the market today. Perhaps even the best AI solution on the market, especially given the software tie-in. For an independent AI venture (startup/enterprise/sovereign), Nvidia is certainly the gold standard. However, the important thing I wanna point out is that AI usage is Pareto disproportionate (likely even more). Meaning, that there are a few specialized use-cases (the largest models trained by the largest companies) that require the lion\u2019s share of the AI workload. Here, things like software tie-in don\u2019t matter - custom in-house solutions suffice. For example: Amazon is able to [use Trainium Chips to pre-train an LLM](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.10630v1), Google (this one should be plenty obvious) [used TPUs to train Gemini](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/#:~:text=We%20trained%20Gemini%201.0%20at,our%20most%20efficient%20to%20serve.), [OpenLlama](https://github.com/openlm-research/open_llama) and [Apple\u2019s Foundation LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21075) have also used Google\u2019s TPUs for training. For the specific points about the alternatives to NVLink / DPU, we can look at what Google\u2019s built - [ICI](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/using-cloud-tpu-multislice-to-scale-ai-workloads) and pods.\n\nSo even though Nvidia deserves all the credit it\u2019s receiving, perhaps you\u2019re giving less credit to the competition than they deserve. Nvidia will continue to dominate in the long-tail of AI use-cases, but if the requirement is top-heavy as it appears to be and the head of the distribution is customised away, that\u2019s a major threat to Nvidia\u2019s dominance. And there is a lot of financial incentive for this to happen. To reiterate a point I made in an earlier comment, for one of Nvidia\u2019s major customers to continue using Nvidia chips (particularly for *internal* workloads), their own technology has to not only be worse, but lag by more than Nvidia\u2019s margins.

{"title": "5/5 Profitable on Every Company Played Earning's", "selftext": "I've been logging my progress using double calendars each week on the sub. This week I was profitable on every company I played for earning's (ON, Meta, Amzn, Aapl, Dkng). This is not an accident or luck, it's becoming increasingly more consistent as gain more experience with double calendars.\n\nI'm just a hair from 30% on the year, the market has experienced its worst drawdown and am totally unexposed and still profiting it's an amazing and beautiful thing to see.\n\n* Three weeks ago was very profitable with NFLX $650/$715 double calendar and TSM $165/$185/$205 triple calendar. However, bought NVDA shares impulsively at the top, options gains covered the losses cutting even. Vowed to never have undefined risk again. Only traded options since, no shares anymore and won't buy shares unless it's an ETF. Am ready to go deep on SMH after see fear and greed index tank to 20's.\n* Two weeks ago was profitable on 3/4 companies played through earning's. Made post detailing the mistake made, bought triple calendar $170 (1), $185 (3), $200 (4) on Google but did not create a neutral structure. There was not enough downside protection, only had (1) put calendar compared to (4) calendars OTM and (3) ATM. Vowed to always play the market neutrally and prepare equally for the downside always.\n\nThis week was profitable on every company or 5/5, last week going 3/4 with the Google mistake being something recognized early, but didn't correct and would've been very profitable going 4/4 had bought more put calendars and offset the ATM and OTM call calendars.\n\nThis week played (ON $64/$76), (Meta $455/$510), (Apple $205/$217.5/$230), (Amzn $165/$180/$195), (Dkng $32/$40)\n\nMost of the contracts like to close before earning's to secure profit, offset the cost/risk of what I do hold through earning's. I also use the ATM calendar as the new bottom or top if price has moved too aggressively. For example, I had meta $400/$455/$500 originally but the price over few days ran from $455 to $475. So right before earning's I closed the $400/$500. I used the $455 as the floor, opening the $510 as the new top so $455/$510 instead to carry through earning's. Have to adapt.\n\nImo nobody can become consistently profitable without playing to the upside and downside, this is why neutral structures like double calendars are so effective, more-so during earning's when high IV environment gives massive premiums offsetting the cost of the calls/puts so playing direction on a mulligan. The ultimate Theta play imo.\n\n(Next week have LLY $730/$795/$870, DDOG $90/$125, ELF $135/$185,  - Need companies to report later in the week so can close before earning's, right before expiration, giving Theta time to burn up to the last moment possible, giving the market no time to react to earning's; the following days always dangerous. For example, Meta much harder to play than Amazon, difference of reporting Wednesday close vs. Thursday close. If wanted to be a gambler could hold all my contracts through earning's. but I want to sell and keep what I hold through basically for free from the profit of closing before, which really has cost me profit but am more concerned about averting risk.)", "id": "1eii1ot", "created_utc": 1722624837.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "Yea I didn\u2019t manage my risk and I\u2019m down 60% over the last two days because I\u2019m highly regarded.

Sell the week of earnings, and buy one to three weeks later. \n\nI\u2019ll also trade doubles on daily movers. You definitely need to go narrower on these. For example, I did aapl selling next week, buying the week after 215/225 and 215/230 today and made about 10% per contract. If I held all day, the gains would have been substantially higher, because the stock settled down in my range and the vix pumped. \n\nThese types of trades tend to work more consistently when the vix is below 16.

Am noticing a good return is 50-80% of the original debt paid. This is selling contracts before earning's, if I held all of the contracts through earning's can make 100-200% of the original debt paid but risking 100% of the original debt paid of course. \n\nNow am trying to set a sell order for 30% of the original debt paid, sometimes can get that before even earning's just morning volatility pop for a few minutes. So leaving gtc orders at 25-30% of original debt paid is what am starting this next week for cleaner early exits. When buying am placing -10% what the current bid ask is to get a better deal. \n\nWith more experience I'll get better at narrower ranges like Apple's implied move with 4%, I didn't need the $205/$230 (closed the $217.5 before earning's for almost 50% the debt paid). Could've closed all and opened $210/$225, or $215/$225 but if am little OTM it helps Theta since not so close to the strike. \n\nI've looked at selling the week of earning's and buying the 2nd or 3rd week out but have to ask why? To let the market react to the report and allow the call or put now time to move further in its intended direction? I can see how that's more profit giving long leg more time to mature after having short leg pay most of it off and then using the extra time to give market opportunity to react to report aka letting call/put run.

We're not fortune tellers, picking direction is guessing with slightly higher probability sometimes but not systematic like my approach. I like to exit before and after earning's. Apple had 4 contracts, 3 of which closed before earning's, this made the calendar I held through earning's cost basis 40% cheaper, which ran 105% percent of original debt paid when closed. If I held all 4 contracts through earning's I'd have been substantially more profitable.\n\nThis is a massive learning phase for me, going from not knowing anything about options in 10 months to picking my strategy and creating my system which I use to react to events. I don't want to think much or make many decisions, just want a repeatable plan in place. As get better, I'll probably hold most my calendars through earning's and take much bigger positions. I could've held 50 apple contracts through earning's and made thousands of dollars but instead I ran 4, sold 3 before and held 1 through earning's. So I am consistent now but I need more practice/experience.\n\nRight now, I need to learn how to get cleaner entries and exits. See the price, enter buy order -10% less to get cleaner entry, instead of taking first price given. And sell at 9-10am when volatility is higher so have more profitable exit.

{"title": "Intel to cut 15% of headcount, reports quarterly guidance miss", "selftext": "Intel had a rough Thursday, announcing a disappointing quarterly performance and plans to cut about 15% of its workforce\u2014around 15,000 jobs\u2014as part of a $10 billion cost-cutting strategy. The chipmaker also slashed its fiscal fourth-quarter dividend and planned to reduce capital expenditures by over 20%. These moves come as Intel struggles to align its operations with market realities and invest in emerging AI technologies.\n\n**By the Numbers:**\n\n* **Earnings per share:**\u00a02 cents adjusted (vs. 10 cents expected)\n* **Revenue:**\u00a0$12.83 billion (vs. $12.94 billion expected)\n* **Year-over-year revenue change:**\u00a0-1%\n* **Net loss:**\u00a0$1.61 billion (vs. net income of $1.48 billion in the prior year)\n* **Client Computing Group revenue:**\u00a0$7.41 billion (+9% YoY)\n* **Data Center and AI unit revenue:**\u00a0$3.05 billion (-3% YoY)\n* **Stock performance YTD:**\u00a0-42% (S&P 500 +14%)\n\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger attributed the losses to accelerated investments in AI-enabled PC chips, anticipating that these will pressure margins in the near term but lead to significant market growth by 2026. Additionally, Intel's decision to shift chip wafer production from Oregon to Ireland will increase short-term costs but is expected to improve gross margins in the future.\n\nCompetition has also been fierce, with rivals like AMD and Qualcomm pushing aggressively to capture market share. Despite these challenges, Intel\u2019s PC chip division showed resilience, hitting $7.41 billion in revenue, driven by AI-friendly chips, which exceeded internal expectations.\n\nHowever, Intel\u2019s Data Center and AI unit posted $3.05 billion in revenue, missing analyst expectations and reflecting ongoing struggles in the sector. For the upcoming quarter, Intel forecasts an adjusted net loss of 3 cents per share on revenue between $12.5 billion and $13.5 billion, well below analyst expectations.\n\nIn other developments, Intel announced an $11 billion joint venture for a chip manufacturing plant in Ireland and launched the Xeon 6 server processors along with a Gaudi 3 AI accelerator.\n\nGelsinger's memo to employees highlighted the need for Intel to realign its cost structure and adapt to market shifts, especially as AI becomes increasingly central to the company\u2019s strategy. Despite these efforts, Intel's stock has tumbled 42% this year, starkly contrasting the S&P 500's nearly 14% gain.\n\nsource:\u00a0[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/01/intel-intc-q2-earnings-report-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/01/intel-intc-q2-earnings-report-2024.html)", "id": "1ehxe4n", "created_utc": 1722561269.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "I know someone who had a rougher Thursday", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "The inheritance guy?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Spot on.
