A few hellofresh dishes a month and you're gonna get tired of it. I can only eat so much in a week (no background eating unlike background entertainment). Sometimes I wanna cook something from the motherland maybe. Summer months? I wanna eat out, not cook home. Travelling? I'm gonna not cook. Kids are out of town? Order pizza. So many scenarios where pausing your subscription, or even quitting hellofresh makes sense. So naturally the churn rates are gonna be higher in this business. Its how humans interact with food. It's different to how we interact with entertainment.\n\nWith that said, I do think Hellofresh has really stupid policies in place, which encourage cancellations (reactivation discounts) and no loyalty rewards (to encourage pauses instead of cancellations). I think they've started fixing this. But it's gonna be interesting to see if it actually makes a difference, or if people just leave because the product is too expensive without all those discount.\n\nUltimately, its all about price. If the product was cheaper, people would get it why not. Realistically, Hellofresh has to lower the price, while keeping or increasing margins.
