It is ladding GPUs  to the current infrastructure that relies on Cpu processing. IThe CEO told us that the data center business will boom considerably next year. They made 30B on that business this quarter. I think it will go up 30% easily.  The 1 trillion infrastructure built today will be modernized to \u201caccelerate computing\u201d and the best way to do this  is using nvidia solutions. There is no competion.  Blackwell will be way faster and it will allow nvidia to build and deploy AI factories to companies who want to rent infra to other companies to train and deploy their models and/or companies that need a powerful infra AI to train pretty large and complex models.  Now this is my opinion: companies like alphabet, meta, Amazon  have the cash to order these type of ultra massive systems from nvidia and integrate with their ecosystems and offer to their customers. I can see the US government building a super infra on AI using Nvidia.   So I think Facebook, google and Amazon will invest a lot of money building these and nvidia is the only company who can deliver.

These can happen, but they're big ifs.\n\nMeanwhile in the CPU market, AMD are the lesser player who after a few years of well-invested R&D on their part and a lot of bag fumbling on Intel's part, are well on their way to _becoming_ the market leader. They have the outright technologically superior product today by the metrics that matter on laptops and in the datacenter, and Intel appears increasingly unable to get its house in order as we saw by the recent 30% drop.\n\nNvidia's making bank on AI datacentre expansion but every server in every datacentre of every _kind_ needs a ton of expensive CPU hardware. AMD's market share in x86 datacentre revenue has exploded from barely 2% to over 40% in just 8 years and there's no reason to believe that won't grow to 80-90% in the next 5-10 years. Their key technical innovation is also about manufacturing costs, so their per-unit margins are 2-3x what Intel's are at the moment too.\n\nIn addition, while I'm less bullish on it, AMD have reclaimed a lot of market share in the desktop GPU space from Nvidia while they've spent the last 5 years focused on blockchain and AI. That's an extremely price-sensitive market far less interested in these massive chip dies that Nvidia's been focused on for the past few years. If Nvidia continues to focus on the datacenter and let their desktop offerings stagnate then AMD will beat them there too.\n\nLonger term too, Nvidia are building their house on sand much the same way Intel did. The key challenge in chip design isn't making a chip fast, but rather efficient. Intel's barely moved the efficiency dial on its top-end chips in years, they've only kept up on performance by throwing more power at them. From the late 90s until the mid 2010s desktop CPUs were stable around 100 watts max draw, but Intel's got chips now pushing it over 300 watts, which also means you've tripled the heat generated. This is an inconvenience on desktops, but in the datacenter or on mobile where power and heat are the biggest constraints it makes them incredibly unappealing.\n\nNvidia's doing the same thing now with its GPUs. Blackwell requiring water cooling isn't an innovation, it's a costly bandaid. People will pay anything right now because its the hot new thing and being first to market is worth it, but eventually things will stabilise, businesses will demand lower operating costs, and Nvidia will be truly between a rock and a hard place improving their power efficiency while still providing generational performance improvements. AMD haven't solved this problem or anything, but they're demonstrably ahead by those metrics largely fueled by a few key R&D gambles that took years.\n\nThere's just so much more headroom and so many less \"ifs\" on AMD's future growth prospects, so naturally a lot more of it is priced in.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You wrote a lot of words, some of them I was able to read, fewer I was able to understand.
