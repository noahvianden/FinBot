{"title": "Using SPX short box spread trade to finance a house with a consolidated position to provide margin", "selftext": "I need about 300k to finance a home purchase, I'm planning to use a short box spread on SPX to borrow the funds at about \\~4%(give or take) implied interest rate.\n\nI have a margin account with a highly consolidated position, almost 100% of this account in a single stock. (In case you think I'm an idiot I got it as an early employee, I left the company a few years ago, and most of my other funds are in robo advisor tax loss harvesting accounts that I can't leverage without incurring alot of capital gains). This consolidated stock position will be used to provide the margin to allow me to withdraw the proceeds from selling the box so I can close on the house.\n\nThe issue is the stock was trading below 3 dollars just a couple months ago, and my understanding is if it falls back below $3 it will no longer be marginable and will trigger a margin call. I could just liquidate the consolidated stock but I'm not happy with the current trading price, I have a target price I'd like to sell at, but that leaves a huge margin call risk and chance of liquidation.\n\nMy strategy for mitigating the margin call/liquidation risk is:\n\n1. Sell calls on the stock at about my target price. If they get called away that's great I'll then invest in something less volatile like SPX to maintain margin and reduce risk. If they don't I'll just repeat till they do.\n2. In the short term since the calls may not get assigned for several months or at all in the near term, and the premiums will be small compared to the box. I plan to buy OTM puts as a hedge to reduce risk, if the stock were to suddenly crash, I could at least liquidate shares at that price rather than a lower price to restore margin.\n\nMy only concern is that if the price falls below $3 my brokerage might do something dumb instead of exercising/selling the PUTS. The options market for this stock also doesn't appear to be efficient so it's possible that the Puts price may not show a clear increase in value when the stock price falls. Is this an unfounded concern? Or is what I'm proposing in fact wildly reckless, and I should just liquidate some shares at a lower price than I'd like?\n\nUsing a throwaway account for privacy, and I'd rather not name the stock as it narrows me down to about <20 people.\n\nEdit: My consolidated position is worth \\~$2M so there's enough marginable assets to cover the margin requirement on the box at least at the current value.

Let\u2019s not waste a tremendous amount of time on this but we can solve this issue pretty quickly. You didn\u2019t reveal that you had a 2mm account until the comments so your stock concentration is not that high in context. Portfolio margin (PM) allows for the freeing up of constrained capital through both cross - asset relationships and through direct hedging vis a vis using options. In other words, you need to understand synthetic relationships to get the most out of this, you are not utilizing your account properly. Assuming they give you margin at roughly 1/6 capital on deposit and apparently you need more, you should be able to free up much more of your account if you convert your position to a synthetic call. What this means is you buy your equivalent at the money puts on your stock let\u2019s say every 90 days - you now only need to pay in margin the amount needed to own the call. So for example you own 10,000 shares of Ford which is trading 10.85 on the close - you buy 100 October 11 puts ( we round up or down on the mid point for hedging purposes) for .52 \u2026 10,000 x .52= 5,200\u2026. You\u2019re now carrying 100 Ford October 11 calls and your position which used to run you 108,500 @ 16% (about 17,000) now costs you $5200  (albeit you are now trading 50 cents on the dollar bc you\u2019re at the money on the October calls, but with price appreciation this will become better) Do you get my drift? You can double up your stock, you could buy 100 actual calls, you could just accept that you\u2019re hedged, etc. I hope this helps.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yea I mentioned the consolidated position but not the size, I guess it doesn't go without saying that I have adequate margin(today) for the box. I've edited to add that now. I'm getting \\~25% of 2M as margin so \\~500k which is enough to cover the margin requirement on the box \\~300k. It sounds like you think I need a margin loan which I don't think is the case.\n\nMy worry is the stock price could drop 50% tomorrow(or more) and now I only have 250k in margin which means I'm now going to get a margin call for 50k(Edit: It's actually even worse cause if the price drops below $3 I think I lose almost all that 500k of margin as the asset is no longer marginable so it'd essentially be a margin call for the full value of the box), that would make me a sad panda. If it continues to go down then the broker could decide to liquidate my stock at the low before I can deal with the margin call, to try and restore margin, making me a double sad panda. The stock is a tech startup still pre-profit, HV30 over 100%, so it ain't a blue chip. If J Powell on Friday says interest rates are gonna stay where they are for the foreseeable future, it will almost surely drop almost 50%.\n\nSo basically I'm buying Puts with a strike price I can tolerate selling at if my back is against the wall, I'm not trying to eliminate all delta risk just trying to avoid having my position wiped out due to volatility. There's a margin requirement on the puts, but I think that's more of a book keeping detail the overall margin available on my account doesn't go down by that amount because the put has value.\n\nI guess it's not even really that important but kind of a secondary minor detail, that I'm selling calls. I'm selling covered calls not buying them, with the hopes that they eventually get assigned, this is just to try and diversify my single stock position at the price i want to sell at some time in the future, I don't care too much when exactly as long as it happens within the next few months if it doesn't, well at least I got to collect the premiums and I'll have to sell some at market rate.  and I don't want to continue having to buy puts forever as protection from a sudden drop. If I can liquidate an amount a little bit more than the margin requirement on the box loan then i can put it into SPX and not have to worry about the margin requirement all that much, unless there's a headline news market event.\n\nI appreciate the comments and I'm sure this isn't optimal from an options trading perspective, but from my standpoint of needing cash now and wanting to diversify but not wanting to sell at current prices it seems to make sense to me.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You\u2019re not boxed, you\u2019re creating a synthetic call and you\u2019re selling out of the money calls against it.\n\nYou are going to have a synthetic call spread.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, for company X.

{"title": "Waymo says it has doubled its weekly paid robotaxi trips to 100,000 since May", "selftext": "Waymo has marked a major milestone by doubling its weekly paid robotaxi rides in the U.S. to over 100,000, a significant jump from the 50,000 rides reported in May. This growth was highlighted by co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana on LinkedIn, showcasing the rapid expansion of Waymo's services across major cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, Austin, and Los Angeles. Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, is not only increasing its service reach but also advancing its technology. The company recently introduced its \"generation 6\" self-driving system, which is designed to operate in a broader range of weather conditions while requiring fewer expensive sensors, signaling a leap forward in autonomous driving.\n\nBacking these technological advancements, Alphabet announced in July that it would inject an additional $5 billion into Waymo. This investment underscores Alphabet's commitment to extending Waymo's robotaxi service beyond its current markets, primarily in the Sun Belt states. With a fleet of around 700 vehicles, Waymo has been steadily expanding its operations, including new service areas in San Francisco and a significant enlargement of its coverage in Phoenix. These expansions position Waymo as a leader in the autonomous vehicle market, even as it continues to innovate and scale its operations.\n\nDespite growing competition globally, particularly in China from companies like Didi and Pony.ai, Waymo remains at the forefront of the U.S. robotaxi market. Competitors like GM's Cruise have faced setbacks, temporarily halting their driverless services, while Tesla has yet to fulfill its long-promised driverless vehicle capabilities. As Waymo continues to grow and enhance its offerings, it solidifies its position as a dominant player in the emerging autonomous vehicle industry.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/20/waymo-has-doubled-its-weekly-paid-robotaxi-trips-to-100000-since-may.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/20/waymo-has-doubled-its-weekly-paid-robotaxi-trips-to-100000-since-may.html)", "id": "1ey2vht", "created_utc": 1724278977.0, "score": 97, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "all I know is that's waymo than last month", "score": 92, "replies": [{"body": "Lol", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14363020658493042}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ancient relic of great historical value .

{"title": "Target beats on earnings and revenue, but gives cautious sales outlook for the year  ", "selftext": "Target said Wednesday that sales grew about 3% in its fiscal second quarter, a return to growth after a prolonged stretch of sluggish sales and squeezed profits.\n\nThe discounter beat Wall Street\u2019s earnings and revenue expectations, as shoppers made more visits to Target\u2019s stores and website and bought more discretionary items like clothing.\n\nEven so, the company stuck by its previous full-year sales forecast and struck a cautious note. Target said it expects comparable sales for the full year to range from flat to up 2%, but said it now expects the increase will likely be in the lower half of the range. \n\nTarget raised its profit guidance, however, saying it expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $9 to $9.70, up from the previous range of $8.60 and $9.60.\n\nShares rose more than 10% in premarket trading as Target showed improvement in generating profits.\n\nOn a call with reporters, Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke said Target took a \u201cmeasured approach\u201d with its outlook because it\u2019s hard to predict consumers\u2019 mindsets and the state of the economy in the coming months.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019ve been pleased with our performance so far this year, and our view of the consumer remains largely the same, the range of possibilities and the macroeconomic backdrop in consumer data and in our business remains unusually high,\u201d he said.\n\nHere\u2019s what Target reported for the three-month period that ended Aug. 3 compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $2.57 vs. $2.18 expected\n\nRevenue: $25.45 billion vs. $25.21 billion expected\n\nTarget, known for its wide array of trendy but low-priced merchandise, has been hurt as consumers buy fewer items like new outfits or home decor while they pay more for everyday expenses like food and housing. The big-box retailer has also struggled with reduced profits in recent quarters, as customers bought items like groceries that tend to be lower margin, and losses from damaged inventory and theft, including organized retail crime, took a toll.\n\nThose trends improved in the second quarter, as Target attracted shoppers with new merchandise and reduced prices.\n\nTarget\u2019s net income jumped to $1.19 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $835 million, or $1.80 per share, in the year-ago quarter. That\u2019s a more than 40% year-over-year increase.\n\nTotal revenue rose from $24.77 billion in the prior year.\n\nComparable sales rose 2% in the quarter, the first time in five quarters that Target posted a gain. The industry metric tracks sales online and at stores open at least 13 months.\n\nDigital sales drove most of those gains, growing 8.7% in the quarter, as more customers used same-day services like curbside pickup and home delivery. Comparable store sales rose slightly, up 0.7%.\n\nTarget has tried to rev up sales and drive higher foot traffic by deepening loyalty and offering discounts. The company relaunched its loyalty program early this year and introduced a new paid membership, Target Circle 360, that includes perks like free same-day deliveries. Target threw its own sales event in July to compete with Amazon\u2019s Prime Day. And it announced in May that it would cut prices on about 5,000 frequently bought items, including diapers, milk and paper towels. \n\nCEO Brian Cornell said customers have responded well to the price cuts and credited them for contributing to traffic growth in the quarter. \n\nCustomer traffic across Target\u2019s website and store grew 3% in the second quarter compared with the year-ago period. The average size of customers\u2019 shopping baskets, however, declined slightly, Fiddelke said.\n\nDiscretionary sales, which have been under pressure across the retail industry, improved. Target said apparel sales, for instance, grew more than 3% in the quarter compared with the year-ago period. \n\nBack-to-school has also been an important season for the retailer. Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said on a call with reporters that the shopping season has matched Target\u2019s expectations, as many customers gravitate toward items with good value like backpacks that cost $5 and crayons that cost 25 cents. \n\nHe said back-to-college shopping tends to be a longer season, as students gradually decorate their apartments and dorms.\n\nShares of Target closed on Tuesday at $144.33. As of Tuesday\u2019s close, the company\u2019s stock is up about 1% so far this year. That\u2019s trailed behind the S&P 500\u2032s approximately 17% gains during the same period.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/21/target-tgt-q2-2024-earnings.html", "id": "1exmpzs", "created_utc": 1724238216.0, "score": 65, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "Finally.
