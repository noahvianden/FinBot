I.e., granny Pelosi has voted for FIT21 crypto bill in the house, and Schume in response to banks lobbying has voted to repeal the SEC rule to ban banks from offering digital assets custody for their clients (although biden vetoed it but still it counts). \n(2) Trump has been passionately supportive of Bitcoin, especially during the last month. Look up how he talks about it.\n(3) Biden lost part of his progressive base due to how he tried to handle the middle east conflict.\n(4) Israeli PM went out yesterday and openly criticized Biden and talked high of Trump.\n(5) $MSTR was upgraded with a juicy $2850 price target last week\n\n1+2+3+4+5 = A Trump win in November followed or accompanied by massive Bitcoin bull run.
