The stock columns are simple calculations of price vs original and corresponding percentage. The option profit/loss figures were obtained from [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/), and I used the Aug returns because they seemed like a good halfway exit.\n\nEDIT: To clarify, the return columns are P/L divided by capital required. I also reran these calculations using 118 shares of stock ($52.6k) compared to 2 contracts ($52.9k) and the returns are similar. At stock price of 519, the stock return 15.32% and option returned 23.06%. It was surprising to me that despite the price/share is much lower, the return on capital is higher by several percentage points as opposed to multiples like DITM LEAPS have been touted.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fhrwalv38s8d1.jpg?width=1970&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1d766c83a79037812003a98628aaf712a26f268\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0mablv38s8d1.jpg?width=1555&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ac845c1b57ed7fc8da425654df00e8b9587da673", "id": "1dogphw", "created_utc": 1719349276.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "The way I like to think about deep ITM call LEAPS is by using its synthetic equivalent: long stock + protective put\n\nWhen you buy a protective put on long stock, your mentality isn't typically \"this is going to make me more money if the stock goes up.\" It's a protective measure, a hedge\n\nIn this example, you're buying protection at the 205 strike for a stock with a current price of 450.

{"title": "Skyrocketing Returns: Invest in RKLB and the Future of Space Launches!", "selftext": "**Have you heard about Rocket Lab USA?**\n\nAerospace and space launch service-provider: Rocket Lab USA is Elon Musk\u2019s famous SpaceX, biggest competitor. What if I told you that a company that was founded in 2006 in New Zealand and headquartered in California only in 2013 is currently outpacing SpaceX\u2019s growth?\n\nYou heard me right. This year, so far, Rocket Lab has launched a total of 9 payloads vs a total of 9 launches during 2023. If they maintain the pace throughout 2024, we might get a total of 18 launches or more, which equates an outstanding growth in # of launches of more than 100%. On the other hand SpaceX has launched a total of 60 times so far vs a total of 96 launches in 2023 ([SpaceX closes out record-breaking 2023, prepares for more records in 2024 - NASASpaceFlight.com](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2023/12/falcon-roundup/)). Keeping the same pace would mean SpaceX will launch about 120 payloads in 2024, which accounts for a growth rate of about 25% only.\n\nMost analysts value SpaceX at over 180 Billion $. Note that, so far in 2024, it has launched close to seven times more payloads than its competitor Rocket Lab USA. Note, however, that Rocket Lab\u2019s market value sits close to 2 Billion $, which would mean that SpaceX is valued around 100 times more than Rocket Lab USA currently is.\n\nI\u2019m sure I have raised your eyebrows already. Please be patient and bear with me for a minute, while I go through Rocket Lab\u2019s fundamentals and explain my thesis on the following chapters.\n\n\n\n**So, where is the money?**\n\n\n\nRocket Lab USA adds value to two main costumer segments:\n\nB2B (Business to Business):\n\n   * Private companies, particularly those in telecommunications, Earth observation, and technology demonstration sectors are looking for affordable access to space for launching and operating their small satellites.\n\n   * Universities and research organizations utilize Rocket Lab\u2019s services to deploy scientific instruments and experimental payloads, facilitating advancements in space science and technology.\n\n\n\nB2G (Business to Government):\n\n   * Rocket Lab serves various government and defense customers, including NASA, the U.S. Department of Defense, and other international space agencies. These missions often involve scientific research, reconnaissance, and national security payloads.\n\nThey serve the above customers by monetizing the below added-value services:\n\n1. **Electron Rocket Launches**:\n\n   * **Small Satellite Launches**: The Electron rocket, designed to carry small payloads. It provides cost-efficient launches. See hereunder the KPIs for Rocket Lab\u2019s flagship product:\n\n\n\n[Electron KPIs \\(Rocket Lab USA Website\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xrbp8sorhp8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=14ff74c7e22a12acdf9f48d47fe1a3f7ce3d21ff)\n\n2. **Neutron Rocket Launches**\u00a0\n\n   * Neutron is being developed to carry larger payloads, targeting the medium-lift market.\n\n\n\n**Which wave are we surfing here?**\n\nA new report ([Space economy | World Economic Forum (weforum.org)](https://www.weforum.org/publications/space-the-1-8-trillion-opportunity-for-global-economic-growth/)) by WEF states that space will be a 1.8$ Trillion opportunity by 2035. Currently space industry represents about 400 $ Billion In total valuation. That would be more than a 4X in the total valuation of the industry in only 11 years. Space launch services are one of the most important verticals within space industry.\n\n\n\n**Who is well positioned to surf this wave?**\n\nEven though there were a lot of small companies that partook on the \u201cgold rush\u201d that space launch industry is, there are not many players that stood the test of time and are still operating (note that we have only selected companies that either have launched payloads since the beginning of 2024 until now, or are planning to launch in the next few months):\n\n\n\n[Number of Space Launches 2024 \\(Spreadsheet\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ljbv6n5thp8d1.png?width=292&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1e61085ea537293aae7d4865bc77bc360791f90)\n\n\n\n**1. SpaceX (privately held company)**\n\n* **Products offered**: Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets.\n\nSince 2010 Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy has launched more than 350 times, with a stellar record of only 2 failures, which represents a failure rate of less than 1%. SpaceX is by far the company that has the biggest share of space launch market.\n\nThis year SpaceX has launched a total of 60 payloads. Most of those payloads are StarLink satellites, but that makes it the US company that has been most active so far.\n\n\n\n**2. Rocket lab USA (NASDAQ: RKLB)**\n\n* **Products offered**: Discussed in previous sections.\n\nRocket lab has launched a total of 9 payloads since the beginning of the year. This makes it the second most active player in the market thus far.\n\n\n\n**3. United Launch Alliance, LLC (ULA)**\n\n* **Products offered**: Vulcan Centaur VC2S and Delta IV Heavy rockets (mostly focused on heavy launches)\n\nUnited Launch Alliance is a joint venture between Boeing (NYSE: BA) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT). Both are listed companies you can invest in. It has launched a total of 3 payloads this year, making it the third most active player.\n\n\n\n**4. Firefly Aerospace (privately held company)**\n\n* **Products offered**: Alpha rocket for small and medium payloads.\n\nFirefly Aerospace has a launch planned for June 2024.\n\n\n\n**5. Northrop Grumman (NYSE: NOC)**\n\n* **Products offered**: Minotaur IV launch system\n\nNorthrop Grumman Space Systems is a division of Northrop Grumman corporation that focuses on aerospace and defense technology. It is currently providing launch services for government and commercial contracts.\n\nThey also have a planned launch for June 2024.\n\n\n\n**Does Rocket Lab USA have a moat?**\n\n\n\nWe all know that aerospace and space launch industry has huge entry barriers, as it is very capital-intensive and costly as a starting investment.\n\nIt is also not easy to be granted the permits to provide launching services in the USA.\n\nA moat is a ditch that used to be dug around castles and fortifications. The whole idea behind it was to make it more difficult for enemies to invade. This term was popularized in the investment world by Warren Buffet, defending that companies should also have their own moats, to prevent market share being lost to new or existent competitors.\n\nThe biggest moats Rocket lab has are their proprietary technologies (uniquely distinguishable from their competitors) and the processes they have designed to ensure efficient launches, you might find some further details about both hereunder:\n\n**Electron Rocket technologies and unique processes:**\n\n   * Electron Rocket Engine - Rutherford is Rocket Lab\u2019s proprietary engine, which has the following unique characteristics:\n\n      * 3D Printed: Most of its components are 3D printed, which allows for a faster production and reduced manufacturing costs;\n      * Battery-powered Pumps: Pumps are powered by lithium batteries, which effectively makes Rutherford the first battery-powered rocket engine;\n\n   * Launching phases:\n\n      * First Stage: The Electron\u2019s first stage uses nine Rutherford engines, providing the thrust required to escape Earth's gravity.\n      * Second Stage: A single Rutherford engine carries the payload into orbit.\n      * Kick Stage: This optional stage provides precise orbital insertion for small satellites, enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of the mission.\n\n   * Reusability: First stage of Electron rocket is reusable. Rockets are refurbished after they have completed their mission.\n\n* **Research and Development (Neutron Rocket):** Rocket lab USA is currently investing hard in its proprietary Neutron Rocket, which is planned to launch for the first time in 2025. Hereunder some details that have already been shared about this rocket:\n\n[Neutron Rocket overview \\(Rocket Lab USA Website\\)](https://preview.redd.it/w0plzdlyhp8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4963a743cbad2f54fc190ed32e54ff476b1f95d8)\n\n[Neutron Rocket Features \\(Rocket Lab USA Website\\)](https://preview.redd.it/1donmohzhp8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6cfd7d0186b277804a4bb46dd89b3a83c43f4aa)\n\n\n\n\n\n**Financial Performance**\n\nRocket Lab USA is still not profitable. I\u2019d rather investigate its financial health and determine how solid their books are and if they will be able, or not, to reach their goals and become profitable, without the need for further capital-raising. Please see below some key ratios:\n\n[Key Figures and Racios \\(Spreadsheet\\)](https://preview.redd.it/4in4xjk1ip8d1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a3ca56d2832792b43b01027d6713a9aa36f311d)\n\n\n\nRocket Lab's current ratio suggests it has a comfortable buffer to cover short-term liabilities, while the quick ratio indicates a need to manage liquidity more tightly, potentially by improving the conversion of inventory to cash or managing receivables and payables more efficiently.\n\n\n\nWe can note, however, that due to R&D costs (110M and 65M in 2023 and 2022, respectively) the financial health has been deteriorating at a faster pace than the growth in revenues yoy of about 16% in 2023 and 239% in 2022.\n\n\n\nIts relatively safe to assume R&D costs will decrease significantly after the Neutron Rocket is finalized and successfully launched in 2025.\n\n\n\n**Will Rocket Lab USA survive until then?**\n\n\n\nThat brings us to Burn Rate and Runway analysis:\n\n\n\nAt the current burn rate of about 6667 thousand $ per month, we have an estimated runway of about 24 months, 2 years. This means that, at the current burn rate, Rocket Lab USA can still probably manage the remainder of 2024 and most of 2025 (which is the planned launch of first Neutron Rocket).\n\n\n\nAsset Utilization: The asset turnover ratio of 0.25 suggests that Rocket Lab may have room to improve in utilizing its assets to generate more sales. This could involve better asset management or increasing sales without a proportionate increase in assets.\n\n\n\nInventory Management: The inventory turnover ratio of 1.25 indicates that Rocket Lab's inventory management might be less efficient, with inventory possibly sitting too long before being sold.\n\n\n\nReceivables Efficiency: The receivables turnover ratio of 6.82 is a strong point, showing that Rocket Lab is efficient in collecting its receivables. This efficiency helps maintain good cash flow, which is crucial for a company that is not yet profitable.\n\n\n\n**If Rocket Lab survives, how big could the upside be?**\n\n\n\nList of assumptions for my forecasting:\n\n1. Revenues will grow 30% in 2024 (slightly below their guidance, if assuming their Q12024 results would apply for Q2, Q3 and Q4 \u2013 if we assume their revenue of 93 M in Q1 to apply to the other quarters, it would equate to about 38% yoy increase), 30% in 2025 and 45% in 2026 (revenue increased based on estimated go-to-market of Neutron rocket launch services);\n2. Cost of revenues will grow steady at the rate it has grown from 2022 to 2023 (about 1% increase).\n3. R&D Costs will increase at the rate it has grown from 2022 to 2023 (about 83%) in 2024. We estimate that it will decrease by 40% in 2025 (due to finally releasing the Neutron Rocket, thus reducing R&D efforts). It will continue decreasing about 3% yoy into 2026.\n4. SG&A will increase yoy at the rate it has grown from 2022 to 2023 (about 24%) until 2025, when it will start growing at 15% until 2026.\n5. Income tax will be 21% the standard corporate income tax once company becomes profitable\n\n\n\nBased on this bullish assumptions, Rocket Lab USA would turn profitable in 2026, turning in a net profit of approximately 106M $.\n\n[Theoretical Valuation \\(Spreadsheet\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xa2bd893ip8d1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f90a922ad1b824b05c76e98a850f27c1077d965)\n\n\n\nIf we maintain the same Price-to-Sales multiple of approximately 8.69X, based on the forecasting with the assumptions laid out above, we can reverse engineer and calculate a theoretical market cap by multiplying our forecasted revenues with the PS ratio.\n\nBear in mind that the PS ratio will almost certainly not remain the same as investors are prone to pay lesser multiples on Sales throughout a company\u2019s lifecycle, paying less and less as the company matures. This is merely an estimate of a potential valuation based on Revenue multiples.\n\nThe final value on 2026 would be 10,64 per Share, which is an upside of about 145% over the current price of 4,34 (COB 22 May).\n\nThis price of 10,64 $ per share and the estimated value of approximately 106M $ of Net profit would equate to a P/E Ratio of about 49,36. I consider this to be a fairly-valued multiple based on potential growth for this market, assuming Rocket Lab will become one of the most prominent players.\n\n\n\n**How well is Rocket Lab USA being run?**\n\n\n\nWould highlight Shaun O\u2019Donnel\u2019s extensive background as a very positive factor. Note, however, that Peter Beck, the founder of Rocket Lab USA, doesn\u2019t have any background in the aerospace industry. It can be possible that they hire a CEO further down the line that brings in more experience managing similar business models.\n\nSo far their management team has managed to grow the company, making it currently the second most active launching service US company (based on # of launches data, which was presented previously).\n\nThey have already built 3 separated launch complexes (2 in the us and the other in New Zealand). They also own multiple manufacturing facilities for their avionics, rockets and engines.\n\nI\u2019d say that despite Peter\u2019s lack of experience in aerospace industry, he has been doing a solid job growing Rocket Lab\u2019s operations and deserves a vote of confidence in his ability to meet Rocket Lab\u2019s shareholders expectations.\n\n\n\n**Potential risks down the road\u2026**\n\nBiggest risk is Rocket Lab\u2019s financial health. Based on the current burn rate, Rocket Lab will run out of money around the end of 2025. This means that they will require further financing. In case they are not able to capitalize themselves, there is a potential risk for bankruptcy.

The 5B share buyback plan is only halfway completed. This meaning that FedEx still has $2.5B to buy back\n\n4. FedEx is implementing a new wave of AI cameras in the contractor trucks. Everyone knows that AI is bullish.\n\n5. FedEx has closed many stations over the last year, with many more likely to come. These closures included layoffs. Both of these are bullish\n\nThe negatives\n\n1. The loss of the USPS contract will decrease yearly revenue by $2B.

{"title": "McDonald's $MCD", "selftext": "# McDonald's: A Top Dividend Growth Play\n\n*  McDonald's has achieved 13 straight quarters of revenue growth, despite high inflation hurting consumer spending.\n* The fast-food chain plans aggressive expansion, with a goal of reaching 50,000 global restaurant units by FY 2027.\n* McDonald's is a 'Dividend Aristocrat' with consistent profitability and potential for dividend growth.\n\n  \nThe company continues to see consistent, low-single digit growth in revenues and is aggressively expanding both domestically and internationally. With moderating inflation and a strong unit growth plan for FY 2024 and beyond, McDonald\u2019s has significant potential for top-line expansion. Additionally, shares trade below the 1-year average price-to-earnings ratio, suggesting a favorable risk profile for long-term investors.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s, a multinational fast-food giant with over 40,000 locations in more than 100 countries and a market cap of $185B, has shown 5% year-over-year revenue growth, achieving $6.2B in the first fiscal quarter. Despite decelerated revenue growth due to inflation, the company still saw a 2% increase in comparable sales in Q1'24, driven by menu price increases, marketing, and customer traffic. The reintroduction of the $5 meal aims to boost foot traffic in U.S. restaurants.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x6g8gh3ryq8d1.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4ec84173238b75ded8f3c82ea9371f6cd26429\n\nAs inflation moderates, increased purchasing power could accelerate McDonald's comparable sales growth. A reversal of the recent downward trend in comparable sales could significantly enhance the investment appeal of McDonald's shares and potentially drive a revaluation of its share price.\n\nThe biggest risk for McDonald's is the trajectory of inflation. Persistent inflation in the second half of the year could continue to pressure consumers. To attract more customers, McDonald\u2019s, in cooperation with its franchisees, has reintroduced its $5 value meal. However, a resurgence of inflation in the third and fourth quarters could pose a significant risk to the company's comparable revenue growth.\n\n\\*\\*I AM CURRENTLY HOLDING SHARES IN THIS COMPANY\\*\\*\n\n", "id": "1doapt1", "created_utc": 1719334248.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 54 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05965085327625275}, {"body": "\"The biggest risk for McDonald's is the trajectory of inflation.\"\n\n**No. The biggest risk to McDonald's is Culver's and Chick-fil-a.**\n\nBoth of which are vastly superior in service, food quality, and consistency.

This has improved all tech x1000. But what hasn't changed in 30 years? Your phone lithium ion battery. This is stopping you from being on Reddit all day at work when your phone dies. What's the solution??? ARCHITECTURE. All battery cells for 30 years are a \"jelly roll\" of cathode and anode layers rolled up into a cell. When you try to put silicon in there to expand the battery capacity the silicon swells up and breaks the battery. There are many shitco battery companies that never do anything and give the space a bad name. They are trying to fix this problem with complicated chemistry solutions. Enovix took the cathode/anode and sliced them into square layers and made a stack (like a sandwich) instead of a roll. This is the same way semi chips are made and stacked or so I'm told. They wrap it in a metal case and this structure can withstand and divert the force of any swelling of silicon. This allows >30% more capacity in a cell depending on its size. They have now replaced the whole leadership team with Qualcomm hardcore chip maker production guys and they are getting this damn factory running and shipping by next year. They are fielding sample orders from large megacap tech and phone OEMs. Today an agreement from a AR headset maker that the customer will pay for retooling to make the chips right for the headset. +30% pop today. These announcements are likely to continue IMO.    AI and LLMs and BLTs are all very power hungry to run. Apple already says they want to run AI on device. This needs better batteries.
