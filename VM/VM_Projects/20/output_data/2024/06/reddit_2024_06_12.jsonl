{"title": "Short Call Strategy: Am I Delusional or Might This Actually Work?", "selftext": "Okay, so I'm guessing a good amount of us in this subreddit were new to options trading at some point in time, and when we were just itty bitty option noobs first hearing about them, we just thought: \" Wow! this is just the same thing as betting on stocks but with leverage right?\" (might just be me when I first got into options trading but whatever). \n\nMoving on. I assume that many people's first instinct was to go and buy a call on a stock they were very bullish on. And I would assume that once we did that, we lost the entire position because we never knew how theta decay, IV, DTE, strike price, and other factors could sink your entire position. \n\nThe thing about these factors is that when you buy a call, the majority of these factors are stacked against you, and if you don't want them to be completely stacked against you, you gotta pay up for a higher premium which is gonna yield the same or less of a return then the lower priced (but considerably more risky) options. You're paying for less risk. \n\nLong Calls are usually only profitable when the underlying has a significant enough uptick to outweigh all the other factors dragging down the value of the option. I'm sorry I don't mean to repeat the basics of valuing options but I think it's important to pretext them a little bit so my strategy makes more sense in the grand scheme of things. \n\nOkay, so my strategy is as follows: why buy a call, and have all of these factors stacked against you, when you can sell one, and have them work in your favor; I guess the whole basis is: the shittier the call, the better (meaning how likely it is to expire or be exercised with no value). The even better thing is we can magnify the shittiness to work in our favor on the sell side by selling balls deep out of the money calls, with low IV, and few DTE. And we can magnify this even *further* by selling calls on options with really shitty stocks underlying; stocks that are down 40% YTD, or just really, really stagnant not moving anywhere (might also get some sexy low IV to work in your favor there too). I don't really have any stocks in mind right now to lock this trade in off the top of my head, but $NOC and $AMD are quite down this last month and a half, and are relatively popular stocks. Like I said I need to find some better stocks for this Strat; these are not the ones I wanna go with, just what I thought of off the top of my head\n\nNow you might be saying two things: 1. \"The prices on them are probably gonna be pennies on the dollar. Sure the odds might be in your favor, but the yield is gonna be very low\", and 2. \"What fucking moron is gonna be stupid enough to buy these calls?\". To answer question 1: Why not just sell more calls? And to answer question 2: I don't think I need to illustrate the stupidity of individuals in the market, but if you need me to, here you go: WSB regards (not dissing, I am also a true WSB regard), teenagers with a Robinhood account that just found out about options, and maybe even people who are legit investors, but have bought the call as a part of some bigger options play, like a straddle, or iron condor (not to mention that in the example of the straddle, I don't think they would really give a shit if the call tanked because, well, it's a straddle lol, the put on the other side would cover the losses and make profit{and yeah there are probably more plays where this is the case that I am just forgetting about, but this is the example I'm just gonna go with for now}). \n\n  \nNot to mention markets are huge and I've checked the open interest on some of these calls and there are hundreds going up to the thousands in open interest on balls deep, 2DTE, giant strike price options. \n\n  \nAnyways, I guess the reason I made this post is to double check with some options veteran (I've been into options for a little less than a year, but I have some knowledge on them from my job) to see if this strategy is complete delusional manic retardation, or if there is actually some substance to it. I wanna make sure there isn't some variable or factor I'm not accounting for that could tank this entire play. If anyone could let me know, that would be much appreciated, thanks.

It's also the exact same thing as just buying a put, but with infinitely more risk in exchange for a very limited upside. This is why you don't see people advocating for it, and why it's not a magical free money strategy.\n\nLet's put some numbers to it, using AMD as an example (I wouldn't call it a shitty stock at a $260B market cap up over 15% on the year, but you do you).\n\nYou decide to sell naked 6/14 AMD calls. At the time I'm writing this AMD is hovering around $160, so we'll choose a strike above that price. I'm excluding strikes above $180 because they max out at $1 in total and most have such low volume that you probably can't find a buyer even at that price. Here's a quick list of strikes and premiums for 6/14:\n\n|Strike|Total Premium per Contract|\n|:-|:-|\n|175|$8|\n|177,5|$5|\n|180|$3|\n\nYou've identified that making $3-$8 is not really worth the time, so you'll need to sell a *bunch* of these to make it worthwhile. Let's say you sell 1000x AMD 6/14 $180 Calls for a total of $3000. The total OI in that call is 12,000, so this may or may not even be possible/would almost certainly drive the price down to the minimum, but let's assume that somehow doesn't happen.\n\nYour max profit is $3000. If AMD manages to reach $180 before Friday, you risk assignment which would force you to buy the shares. 1000 contracts x 100 shares = 100,000 shares @ $180. In exchange for the $3000 you got when you wrote the contracts, you now need $18,000,000 to cover the purchase of shares to satisfy them. We'll make a huge and completely incorrect assumption that your brokerage is totally fine with spot lending you that money because it'll come right back from the call, and we'll (also incorrectly) assume that purchasing those shares all at once does not drive the price up at all. You make $3000 on an $18m transaction, and thank your brokerage for covering you.\n\nIf AMD manages to reach $181 before Friday, the math... changes a bit. You now need $18,100,000 to cover the shares, but only receive $180 in return, for a **loss** of $100,000. Your brokerage is unlikely to cover this deficit, so you're down $97,000.\n\nIf AMD manages to reach $190 (it was there three months ago), you're down $997,000. It can only get worse from here.\n\nYou might be thinking \"what are the chances that happens though!\" and yeah, that's why those contracts are only trading for a few bucks. The chance is pretty slim. But it's also never zero. Let's say you run this exact same scenario with the same parameters every week - you'd need to be right for 34 weeks in a row just to cover one time where the price hits $181.\n\nUltimately, making $150,000 a year while risking infinite losses is just not worth it, because the one time you're wrong you're *dead*, and you're bound to be wrong eventually.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Welp...

To avoid confusion, don't use the terms this way.\n\nHopefully you have heard of short-selling stock, right? Long means when you start with nothing and then buy something. Short means when you start with nothing and then sell something. You can do that with stock. You can start with no shares of a stock, and then sell some. When you do that, you get the money for selling them, but now you essentially owe your broker shares of stock, which you have to buy at some point in order to get rid of the short shares position. You hope to do this at a lower price, in order to make a net profit, so you are hoping the stock goes down.\n\nWell, you can do the same thing with options. You can start with no options, and sell some. When you do that, you get the money for selling them, but you now essentially owe some options back to the market.  This is called being \"short\" those options.  This has nothing to do with whether you are bullish or bearish on the stock, whether you are buying or selling the stock, or whether they are calls or puts. It simply means you started with zero options and then sold some.\n\nWhen you are short options, you can be assigned. This means that someone out there who is long the same option is exercising, and you are chosen at random to take the opposite end of that transaction. So if somebody out there exercises a long call, to buy 100 shares at the strike price, somebody who is short the same type of call option (meaning on the same stock, at the same strike and expiration date) is chosen for assignment, and 100 shares are removed from their account and they are credited with strike times 100 in cash.  That is what can happen to you at any time. Assignment on a short option, not exercise of a long option.\n\nA put option is a contract that gives you the right but not the obligation to sell 100 shares of the underlying, not necessarily to sell it short. If you were to exercise a put, and you happened to have 100 shares of the underlying, the ones you had would be sold.

In that case, instead of being up $3 per contract, you're down $X per contract + you're chasing those losses with the same strategy that initially generated them. You still take on all the risk, but with a vanishingly small reward/the need to cover the difference when you buy back the calls.\n\nThis is why people just buy puts to achieve the same thing.

Due to their partnerships, and the increasing demand for AI server systems, SMCI had their EPS increase significantly as their EPS forecast is around $8.00 per share, which is a major increase from last year, which was $3.51 per share. They also have a PE ratio that is lower than Nvidia and AMD at around 45, a foward PE of 21.79 and a PEG ratio of under 1. As a result of their PEG ratio being below 1, it means that the company is considered as undervalued, and a good investment to have.

I started with 1k and wasn\u2019t too happy with losing it. So I kept depositing money and revenge trading until I had maxed out a 8k line of credit and had 1k left in my port. I contacted RH and told them I\u2019d like to close my account. They of course told me my trades need to clear first. Yada yada yada. Next day I\u2019m like fuck this 1k let\u2019s get it. And from that I went from having 1k in my account, and down 10k on the year\u2026. To being positive 17k. Iv taken out 11k roughly to pay back my line of credit and buy something fun. And today I took the 3k left from that and over doubled it to 6600$. I\u2019m not sure what my next move is yet but I believe I will be pulling 5k more out tomorrow and sticking with the 1.6k left that I\u2019m comfortable playing with. \nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is if I had quit like I planned. I\u2019d be down 10k right now with 1k in my pocket. I made 17k in a little longer than one month with just 1k\u2026.. kind of?\nI just feel like screaming from the rooftop. I\u2019m fucking JACKED about this shit. But I can\u2019t tell anyone because I\u2019m so embarrassed for being -10k in the hole at one point\u2026.
