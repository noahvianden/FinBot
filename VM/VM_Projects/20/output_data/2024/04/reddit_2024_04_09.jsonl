{"title": "My top ideas for next couple weeks", "selftext": "Best long term buying opportunity (not recommend calls but trickling in slowly as still expecting downside risk)\n\nUnited Healthcare - expect more downside but its stock prices have been going down while earnings have gone up.  Good combination for accumulation\n\nAlibaba - harder to recommend after the recent bounce which is why it was moved from my best call idea, which is more of a short term call list, to a long term hold list\n\nDow jones - it broke the 50 day moving average so more downside expected but it\u2019s closest to fair value compared to Nasdaq and s and p\n\nMcDonald - I would have it on my call list if it wasn\u2019t for the risk of not knowing how much of the California new wage for fast food worker is built into sentiment.  But good long term hold because finally valuations are getting better, dividend is decent, and people are selling the stock forgetting/ignoring that California is such a small portion of its global market\n\n\nBest call ideas\nApple -oversold and ready for short term bounce but not a recommended medium term hold.  Also good stock to trickle in slowly and be ready for lot more volatility \n\nAMD - terrible valuation and company but oversold going into earning calls.  People love to buy up semiconductor stocks last couple weeks before the call.  Good hedge if you want to short the tech or s and p index.\n\n\n\n\nBest short ideas\nGold - purely technical.  Way overbought \n\nAmazon - single most overvalued tech stock in the magnificent seven and that\u2019s really saying something.  Biggest risk to the short thesis is the earning call and people not wanting to sell leading into it and instead dumping after, which is why I only have a small position in Amazon in case it does sell of early but saving a big cash pile for major puts if it spikes after earning\n\nMicrosoft - completely overhyped.  Nothing more to say.\n\nEnergy stocks (XLE) - I took some profits on my puts I bought on Friday but look for opportunity to enter shorts after small bounce.  The most overbought sector in the entire s&P and oil price is unsustainable\n\n\n\nOverall statement on the conditions of the market\n\nBe very vigilant as we had into earnings call.  While the market as a whole is still ridiculously overvalued, if earning calls are good enough stock market will ignore/forget the fact that they already ran up expecting the good news.  I anticipate very bumpy 3 weeks.  I see S and P within 1% of all time high and Nasdaq within 1.5% of all time high as excellent short entries and around 5050 on s and p and 435 on the QQQ as strategic places to place bets for short term rebound.  My recommendation is to keep playing those 2 ranges until one either breaks or until after earnings call in which case it\u2019s safe to short the market to hearts content\n\n", "id": "1bzv07m", "created_utc": 1712676532.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "AMZN is my biggest position.

And is there a group of stocks that aren't influenced much by the upcoming announcement (or even go up right beforehand)?\n\nI want to buy the dip before the Fed's announcement occurs tomorrow but can't tell which stocks are dropping due to anxiety surrounding the announcement and which are dropping because of other situations behind the scenes.\n\n**Edited to add: Someone answered my question, just not in the comment section.**\n\n**We are in the \u201cLate Stage\u201d of the economic cycle, which is the stage that usually comes before \u201cRecession\u201d.

Some lesser-known companies in the space \u2014 Finnish fast-charging manufacturer Kempower and Dutch fast-charging operator Fastned, for example \u2014 are turning a corner with respect to profitability.\n>\n>BNEF estimates that annual worldwide public-charging revenue will rise to $127 billion by 2030, with probably the most familiar company \u2014 Tesla \u2014 on track to mop up $7.4 billion, or around 6%, of all that business.\n>\n>Tesla has long been applauded for laying the foundation for EV adoption with its Supercharger network \u2014 the company now has more than 57,000 Superchargers globally. Assuming that each charger delivered around 200 kilowatt-hours a day and that Tesla collected an average tariff of $0.4 per kWh, we estimate that the company generated around $1.74 billion of charging revenue last year. This amounts to around 17% of Tesla\u2019s \u201cServices & Other\u201d segment, and roughly 1.5% of total revenue.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/xSHdMYL\n\n>Tesla\u2019s network hasn\u2019t grown at quite the clip executives have projected. During an October 2021 earnings call, Senior Vice President Drew Baglino said the company planned to triple the size of its network over the next two years. While Tesla has more than doubled since then, the company didn\u2019t quite hit its target.\n>\n>The EV maker has still installed around 13,000 superchargers a year for the last few years. If we assume the company can increase this to 18,000 installations a year, it could have as many as 180,000 superchargers globally by 2030.\n>\n>This level of growth may not materialize for several reasons, but if we assume it does, and project an uptick in charger utilization to 280 kWh per day, driven by a bigger EV fleet and faster charging, the network could deliver an impressive 18.4 TWh a year by 2030.\n>\n>Apply a 10% target profit margin to projected revenue, based on an April 2022 tweet from Elon Musk, and you arrive at a not-too-shabby $740 million in 2030 earnings.\n>\n>Tesla gets additional value out of its the Supercharger network beyond the sale of electricity, in the form of marketing. To access the company\u2019s vast network, non-Tesla drivers have to download the Tesla app and drive to Superchargers plastered with its brand.

So why could puts be the strategy for next week? Because next week Boeing will be testifying in front of congress (well, a subcommittee in the Senate, but still!). They will be asked about all of the issues that have popped up with the 737 for the past few years and now also the reports regarding the 787 and 777. There is absolutely no good news that can come out next week to redeem them short of another company purchasing Boeing and that is almost impossible to happen as Boeing itself is at no risk of being in financial trouble any time soon even with all the issues they have.
