Options are priced according to expected moves. Before an event that can have outsized moves such as earnings, IV rises because the expected move rises and prices for options go way up. For example stock x trades at 100$, a weekly put option for 95$ strike may normal go for .50 since a 5% move is unlikely. And by Thursday if stock x is at 99$ the option may be worth only .20. Now, if its a week where earnings are reported Wednesday after hours the initial cost of thay option may be 2.00 instead of .5. On Thursday after earnings when the event has already occurred that cause the option to cost 2, if the stock has only dropped to 99$, the option is still only worth about .20 because now its just a normal week. \n\nThats the simplified version of IV crush. Once an event occurs all the extra option cost disappears. In this case if the stock is 95$ on Thursday, the option will still be worth less than the 2$ paid for it because your option price needed the stock to drop below 93 by end friday to be profitable and its now far less likely to be.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, I appreciate your detailed explanation.
