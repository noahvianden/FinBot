For example, are you trying to identify a visual glitch in a manufacturing line? Or are you using GenAI to create a theater quality video from text?\n\nFact: Simple inferencing tasks from small models can be done on inexpensive processors/platforms. So if this is what Palihapitiya is talking about, no debate.\n\nBut where AI making the biggest impact today? It's not identifying cats. It's Chat GPT, like what Microsoft is rolling into Office365. Utilizing a complex LLMs with a large memory footprint and servicing millions of requests daily with reasonable latency requires a massive, well designed, cohesive and scaled out solution. There is no better answer today than a large cluster of GPUs.\n\nSo what chips are CSPs building for their own internal work loads? My read is they are working on inferencing towards their core business needs. Think about Google or AWS delivering advertising recommenders. These are not complex workloads and they do not need complex devices to service them. GPUs may be inferencing those workloads today and they are likely up for replacement, but GPUs were the optimal solution the last 8 years. There was nothing better or they would already be using.\n\nAnd that leads to where is AI development going? Workloads are just going to get more complex: Multimodal, trillions of parameters, huge memory footprints. The capex spending on these systems is just going north in a huge way as every major CSP just described in their earnings.\n\nPalihapita is trying to create hope and some vehicle to enrich himself.

The Nasdaq 100 closed up 3.84 percent in daily trading. (Photo by Stephen Chernin/Getty Images) GETTY IMAGES\n\n# Key facts\n\n* The Nasdaq, which is the benchmark index for tech companies, rose 2% by 4 PM ET, hitting its highest point since February 22, while the S&P 500 increased by 1%. \n* The market rally came after Microsoft and Alphabet both reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, according to FactSet, with the world\u2019s largest company Microsoft recording $61.9 billion in revenue and the search engine giant ending the quarter with $80.5 billion sales. \n* Microsoft shares were up 2% to $408 per share Friday, while Alphabet surged more than 10% to $175 per share to book a record $2.2 trillion market valuation after\u00a0[launching](https://abc.xyz/2024-q1-earnings-call/)\u00a0a cash dividend of $0.20 per share and announcing a $70 billion stock buyback plan. \n* Amazon ended its two-day losing streak to deliver a 3.5% gain to trade at $180 per share, as it appears investors are positioning themselves in the tech giant ahead of the April 30 earnings report that\u2019s expected at 82 cents per share from 31 cents a year ago. \n* With Nvidia\u2019s biggest clients betting on continued artificial intelligence investments, shares of the computer chip-making company rallied 6.2% to $877 per share, recovering from last week\u2019s sell-offs to mark its biggest daily gain since March 12.\n\n# Big number\n\n$317 billion. That\u2019s how much money investors gained on tech stocks following Friday\u2019s rally.\n\n# Critical quote\n\nThe earnings reports of big tech companies like Microsoft and Alphabet showed their commitment to AI.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella\u00a0[reportedly](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nvidia-stock-price-buy-sell-microsoft-google-a5d0e558)\u00a0said the company offers AI accelerators including \u201cthe latest from Nvidia,\u201d while Alphabet offers \u201cindustry-leading portfolio of NVIDIA GPUs\u201d together with its in-house TPUs, Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said during the\u00a0[first-quarter earnings call](https://abc.xyz/2024-q1-earnings-call/).\n\n# Tangent\n\nInflation remained unchanged at 2.8% in March from the previous month, but stayed well above the consensus economic expectations of 2.7%.\n\nThe hotter-than-expected inflation figure added to concerns around the economy, which began this year with the slowest pace of expansion since the second quarter of 2022.\n\n# Key background\n\nStock investors usually look out for strong earnings growth, as it could indicate a company\u2019s capacity to generate future cash flows and sustain both capital gains on investment and dividend payouts.\n\nWith Microsoft and Alphabet beating Wall Street earnings estimates in the first quarter of 2024, forecast of increased Amazon sales when it releases its report by April 30, together with indications of continued usage of Nvidia AI hardwares by major clients, it appears investors are upbeat about the growth potential of the big tech companies.\n\n*This article was first published on*\u00a0[*forbes.com*](http://forbes.com/)\u00a0*and all figures are in USD.*Tech stocks on Wall Street defied sticky inflation Friday to post their biggest gain in more than two months\u2014easing market anxiety about a slowdown in economic activities\u2014after blockbuster first-quarter earnings and continued betting on artificial intelligence fired up the valuations of major companies.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
