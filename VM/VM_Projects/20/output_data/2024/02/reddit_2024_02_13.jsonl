A lot of health plans going into 2024 are dropping coverage or cutting back how much they\u2019ll pay for the drug if it\u2019s being prescribed for weight loss.

Let\u2019s get into my earning plays for today\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **ABNB** \\- I can\u2019t see a reason this stock wouldn\u2019t go tits up, no one\u2019s sleeping in hotels anymore, parents don\u2019t wanna sleep at 8 PM cuz it\u2019s their kids bedtime, they\u2019re renting condos and apartments now. Sure NYC passed regulations with the short term rental restrictions, but who the fuck goes to NYC anyway?? \n2. **HOOD** \\- strong balance sheet, lot of cash, they fired a bunch of people back in 2022, Ticktock got all the kids gambling in options these days, BTC skyrocketed this quarter, they should profit from that too. They will beat\n3. **LYFT** \\- Look at uber, those guys are up 10% since their earnings report, no one uses cabs anymore, that shit is from the 80\u2019s. A Lyft ride is also way cheaper than an uber. Im positive coming into earnings with this one\n4. **KHC** \\- In case you didn\u2019t know, KHC stands for Kraft Heinz Company, that stuff you put on every meal since you keep losing money in the casino.
