{"title": "Where is QQQ going this week? (My Friday tale of woe)", "selftext": "So, I buy and sell call options on QQQ. I love a day when the market is down big and I look for the moment when it turns and fights its way back up. I made $6400 last week. But\u2026.on Friday I bought 10 options to expire 2/22 at 436 strike. Price was at around $433 or so at the time. It started to drop. I bought 10 more, cause I knew there would be a turn around. Nope. Dropped more. Then I bought 10 more. This time I was right and it rose nicely and at one point I was now up almost $2000. I was on a long road trip and had just stopped for a bathroom break. I decided to lock in a nice profit with a stop order at $1500 profit. We were getting out of the car and for some reason my order wouldn\u2019t go through. I said, Eh nevermind. I\u2019m fine. Well. 15 minutes later, back in the car, the absolute bottom fell out as you may have seen. Now I\u2019m down like $1200. What the heck happened?!! So what to do? It dropped more. I was dumbfounded. I bought 10 more. I\u2019d really like a nice recovery Tuesday/Wednesday. What do you all think? I\u2019m nervous about NVDA and their earnings Wednesday aftermarket. I\u2019m hoping to get out before then with some recovered loss or maybe even a profit. My cost average is certainly within reach with a nice $2 rise to say 431.50-432.

If you do, the explanation is likely to be volatility, since the width of the distribution is proportional to volatility x time. If you didn't already know that, the link below is a great explainer video. It's kind of long, but it is absolutely worth watching the whole thing beginning to end:\n\n\nhttps://optionalpha.com/lessons/understanding-the-math", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the link. The ticker is SPY.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Okay, it's SPY. Say the average one-day move of SPY is up/down $1 (it's actually $0.75 based on the IV of the front-month ATM call, but I rounded it up for the sake of clarity). That's the average volatility of SPY.\n\nThat means that in 3 days, the maximum expected move would be +/- $3. Less than -$3 would rapidly converge to 0 delta, while more than +$3 would rapidly converge to 1.0 delta.\n\n**So for 3 days, the range of strikes that represents 0.0 delta to 1.0 delta would be between $6 and $7.** This means it takes only a few strikes from ATM to reach a delta of -0.23.\n\nNow let's look at the 27 day expiration. The maximums expected move after 27 days would be around +/- $27.

For example, changes in interest rates work oppositely; a change that is good for calls will be bad for puts, and vice versa. So a structure that is all calls won't react the same to an equivalent structure that is a mix of puts and calls, even if the profit/loss charts are similar.\n\nNow if you had asked why do a short straddle when you could do an **iron fly**, which has both puts and calls, that's a purer comparison. The difference there is more subtle. Even if the two structures start out with identical max profit, that doesn't mean they will *evolve* in the same way over time. For example, due to the additional legs, the absolute value of the *net vega* will be lower for the fly than for the straddle. So if you are primarily playing for a change in IV over time, the short straddle will respond more quickly.\n\nA more obvious difference is that in order to force the max profits to be the same, the strikes or expirations will have to be different. If a short straddle pays 10 units in credit, the exact same strikes and expirations for an iron fly **will always pay less than 10 credits**, because you have to buy additional long legs to make the structure, which decreases the initial credit.

You won't be borrowing margin (hopefully) so just need to worry about maintenance.\n\nTasty isn't the only one to do this, but futures positions are technically held in a separate account. While they look all combined in the platform, they have what they call a futures sweep which moves cash out of your TT account and into your futures account on a daily basis. So your futures margin requirements will always be met with cash. TT could do a better job at showing this in the platform. Two things to keep in mind. The cash held in the futures account does not count towards the $25k balance you would need for daytrading equities. You could show a positive cash balance but still be using margin, if that cash is used by futures margin. You can't put the entire cash balance in SGOV.\n\nYou are correct that you don't exchange any cash on initiating the trade. Mark to market means that the value difference comes in or out of your cash balance on a daily basis. When you close the trade you effectively just make or lose the difference between the opening price and the closing price. /MES settles to cash, which is pretty much the same thing as just selling at expiration.\n\nIn your example, if you held all/most of your cash in SGOV and lost money on /MES that put you into a negative cash balance, you wouldn't get a margin call but just put you into a margin borrowing situation. You don't want this because it costs interest, but it's not a call. You would get a margin call if your buying power goes below $0.\n\nUse the futures if you want leverage or the cash available to do something else.

To hedge the exposure I would need to buy 2 puts (-1.00 delta). How does that make sense since now Im shorting 200 stocks?\n\nHedging is done in dollars, not shares. So a single 0.50 delta put isn't really worth 100 shares in dollars, it's worth 50 shares in dollars. So that's why you need two puts.\n\nIf your shares go down by $1/share, you need the total value of the puts to go up by $1/share in order to hedge to delta-neutral, right? So if you  have a .50 delta put, a $1/share decline in the stock price means a $.50 increase in the put's value.

You have to add that to the strike price to see where you might end up at expiration. So 740 + 43.25 = 783.25. Since 775 is **less than** 783.25, your call was not trending towards being profitable by expiration.\n\nIn general, when you pay a premium for a call, part or all of that payment is an *expectation* that the stock will rise in the future.

Using the breakeven at expiration (that's what the strike + premium is called) can give you a hint when you are *close to expiration*, like you were, but is worthless further from expiration, like a couple of weeks or more. I answered for your specific situation as described, but you shouldn't generalize from that.\n\n\n\nThere are only two things that matter: (1) how much you paid for the contract, and (2) what the IV was when you paid and what direction it ends up going in the future. \n\nHow much you paid determines whether you have a current profit or not. If you paid 43.25 and the call is worth 69.00 currently, you have a profit. If it is worth 42.00, you have a loss. The price of the stock is less important. It's entirely possible for the stock price to go *down*, but you still make a profit. However, that is unusual. Typically for a call, if the value of the call went up, the stock price also went up.

For instance, sell the Feb 23 600 put for 3.40 so now you\u2019ll have a 650-600 bear put spread. You are capping your gain to 50 points minus your debit but if NVDA goes up or doesn\u2019t reach your strike, you will lose $340 less than if you didn\u2019t do the spread. 4) You can add a directional calendar above or below your strike. For example, if you have doubts that NVDA might not go below 650 and think 670 might be more likely. You can sell the Feb 23 670 and buy the Mar 1 670 for a debit of 3.70. Be aware that this calendar spread will lose money after the earnings is released because it is Vega positive. You have theta and delta in your favor if it goes in your direction.  If you get the price correct within +/- 10 points of 670, you will most likely be profitable that will help offset the loss on your 650 puts.  No one can predict how much profit because it will all depend on what the market will price your puts with more than 7 DTE.  5) If you are bearish you can add bear put spreads that are closer to ATM. For example, buy the Feb 23 700 put and sell the Feb 23 690 put for a debit of 4.10. Max loss is 4.10. Max gain is 5.90 is NVDA is < 690 at expiration. Breakeven is 695.90.  This will add more delta risk and theta risk. 6) You can turn it into a directional butterfly to reduce your risk even more by selling two Feb 23 600 puts and buying one 500 put for a credit of 5.80. Your position will  work have a range between 650 and 550. Max profit if NVDA at 600, 50.00 minus your original cost plus credit of 5.80. You will lose if NVDA >650 or <550.  The strike prices can vary will these strategies according to your thesis. These are just examples that came to mind.
