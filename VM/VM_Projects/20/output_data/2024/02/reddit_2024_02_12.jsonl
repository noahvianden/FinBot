See for example \n[Erste Bank](https://www.erste-am.at/en/private-investors/funds/erste-bond-inflation-linked/AT0000619887)., [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vipsx) ,  [Schroders](https://www.finanzen.net/fonds/schroder-international-selection-fund-global-inflation-linked-bond-a-lu0180781048) \n\n- [i-bonds](https://money.stackexchange.com/a/154484/109107) but you\u2019ll need to be one of the following:\n* aU.S. citizen, even if you live abroad\n* a U.S. resident\n* a civilian employee of the U.S. government, regardless of where you live\n\n- corporate inflation protected bonds \n\n**Potential problems:**\n\n- especially corporate bond markets are often illiquid \n- Inflation-Indexed securities can have a negative yield as a result of yields being below (expected) inflation.\n- Most IL bonds adjust the principal value with the CPI (so in case of deflation, you actually have a declining principal). Some countries like the U.S., Australia, France and Germany offer deflation floors at maturity, which means that if deflation drives the principal amount below par, you will still receive the full par amount at maturity.\n- Similarly, coupons payments vary as they are based on the adjusted principal (in this case there is no floor)\n- ILB prices will increase as real yields decline and decrease as real yields rise. If you hold them to maturity, that will not be a real problem.\n- If you invest in funds or ETFs, you have an additional problem, namely that they have no maturity date. Since TIPS are highly sensitive to interest rate movements, the value of a TIPS mutual fund or ETF can fluctuate widely in a very short period, and you are not guaranteed to get your principal back.\n\n\n\n**Structured products** \n- Banks offer inflation protected structured products but beware of the details. It's a bit like autocallables, if it sounds too good to be true it is not true (e.g. the product will have high fees etc that are not directly obvious, or risk you miss)\n\n\nMore for HNWI or wholesale / interbank:\n- Inflations swaps (several variants, like LPI, zero coupon, YoY \n)\n- there are also caps/floors in these inflation swaps", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "My guess is that OP doesn't really care about CPI, but rather the knock-on effect of CPI to Fed Rate cuts, then Fed Rate cuts to equity market bullishness.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Only the OP can tell, but if it's true, it wasn't a well defined question imho.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19771192967891693}], "tickers": ["cpi"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation", "deflation", "cpi"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Spy straddle.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16486746072769165}, {"body": "Take a position on which way CPI is going and trade accordingly.
