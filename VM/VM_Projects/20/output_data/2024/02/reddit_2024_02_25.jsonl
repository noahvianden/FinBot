{"title": "Addressing NVDA concerns", "selftext": "I've noticed a recent influx of worried shareholders flood this subreddit, questioning NVDA's business model and valuation. Imo you shouldn't own a stock if you don't understand the fundamentals of the company. So in an effort to educate worried shareholders on this subreddit, I would like to share my thoughts on NVDA's fundamentals, addressing the business and the common concerns I see.\n\nFirst off, why would someone want to own shares in NVDA stock? Surface level, if you asked the average person today, they would say the reason is that Nvidia is benefiting from A.I. chip sales. While this is true, this is not the entire reason to find Nvidia compelling. A.I. is the fuel source for the larger secular trend of accelerated computing. \n\nAnd what is accelerated computing? To preface, Moore's law has slowed down significantly due to the limit on how small transistors can get before quantum tunneling occurs. The way around this problem in order to get more compute is accelerated computing, a heterogeneous computing paradigm that makes use of specialized computer components such as GPUs, DPUs, ASICs, and software along with the CPU to offload tasks from the CPU to gain more compute and efficiency as opposed to CPU-only based general purpose computing.\n\nAnd so this paradigm shift from general purpose computing to accelerated computing is the key to Nvidia's future growth for years to come. The majority of data centers today still use general purpose computing and will switch to accelerated computing if those companies want to stay competitive.\n\nThe next question you may ask is what makes Nvidia special in accelerated computing? Can't other companies produce products just like Nvidia to fulfill modern data center needs? What's special about Nvidia is the platform they have built for nearly two decades. The CUDA API is a software moat that often gets downplayed for its importance, but it is significant because it has created a mature platform for developers. Similar to Apple's ecosystem or Meta's family of apps, Nvidia's full stack solutions platform makes it difficult for customers to switch to other vendors due to high switching costs and the strong network effect.\n\nOne of the main bear cases I see for Nvidia's business model is that big tech will develop their own custom ASICs to replace Nvidia GPUs. The problem with this argument is that it ignores the difficulty of creating a replacement for Nvidia GPUs. While big tech can make custom ASICs for specific tasks in their data centers, custom ASICs cannot replace Nvidia GPUs for all the tasks they do. Big tech will still need Nvidia GPUs for versatile accelerated computing tasks. And the reason they choose Nvidia over AMD is because of the mature CUDA developer platform.\n\nThe other bear case I often see is the valuation for NVDA. An objective way to estimate NVDA's valuation is to consider the PEG ratio (Price to Earnings to Growth). NVDA right now is approximately $800 per share. Fiscal year 2024 (calendar year 2023) earnings per share was about $12. Fiscal year 2025 (calendar year 2024) earnings per share is estimated to be about $24. Therefore, P/E trailing twelve months is 67, and forward P/E is 33. I'll leave it to you to decide if you think it is expensive or cheap based on these numbers.\n\nWell that's all I have for now. I hope this addresses the main concerns.

Lisa thinks she's going to be successful delivering a cheaper product and capturing market share.  Well sure to a degree.  But Nvidia is growing at 200% and AMD is still in the starting gate.

As you get farther OTM, the decay inverts in behavior - significantly OTM options decay faster at the start, then slow down approaching expiration.
