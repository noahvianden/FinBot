{"title": "Boring Saturday morning", "selftext": "It's too hot to do the yard work that needs doing, so it's a good time to fire up Jupyter and mess around some more.\n\nHere's something encouraging for the buy and hold crowd.\n\nI pulled the monthly returns for NVDA from Jul 2004 to Dec 2022.  This intentionally excludes the runup that we've seen since the beginning of 2023.  **The monthly returns are normally distributed with a mean of .0313 and a stdev of .1375.**  Interestingly, while the daily returns of NVDA more closely approximate the t-distribution, the monthly returns meet all standard tests for normality.  Because someone will sharpshoot this, here's the testing to demonstrate it.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lavtn255lpdd1.png?width=822&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c4dfbbe72f9e2ae339f8ef47184ba0ed1947b6d\n\nRemember, I intentionally excluded the run up of the last 18 months.\n\nWith a starting balance of $250K, here's what 10 years of random monthly returns based on the 2004-2022 give us.  Other assumptions are specific to my situation. I suspect that if you forewent the contributions and the withdrawals it would end up similar enough to be considered a wash.\n\n* $2500  # Monthly contribution from Months 0 to month 48\n* $250000  # Starting value\n* 0.005  # Monthly withdrawal rate from months 49-96\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p1j5gpoolpdd1.png?width=765&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc56044a0ed71d8865cfd95654d7175593ae7ff6\n\nI think the encouragement here is that even if the rocketship of growth is past, NVDA has ALWAYS been a high return, high volatility stock.
