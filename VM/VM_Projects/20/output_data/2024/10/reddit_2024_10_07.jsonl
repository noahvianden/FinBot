Confidence in reaching the first target is moderate due to mixed market signals, but the second target carries lower confidence given potential resistance and broader economic uncertainties. Keep an eye on volume spikes and news updates for any shifts in sentiment.\n\nBA:\n\n> Boeing (BA) is currently facing headwinds due to union demands for pension revival and competitive pressures from SpaceX, alongside a lowered price target due to expected cash burn in its Defense and Commercial segments.

The MACD histogram is positive, suggesting a potential short-term reversal, but the RSI remains neutral, reflecting indecision. Given the broader market's cautious optimism and Boeing's specific challenges, a short position could be considered. Enter at $155.00, with a first target of $152.50 and a second target of $150.00, setting a stop loss at $157.00. Confidence in reaching the first target is moderate due to ongoing market volatility and geopolitical tensions, while the second target carries lower confidence given potential support around $150.00. Traders should remain vigilant for any news impacting Boeing's defense contracts or union negotiations.\n\nSAVE:\n\n> Spirit Airlines (SAVE) is facing significant downward pressure following news of potential bankruptcy, with the stock currently trading at $1.69. The technical indicators are overwhelmingly bearish: the RSI is deeply oversold across multiple timeframes, and the MACD shows a negative histogram, indicating strong selling momentum. Recent price action has seen SAVE plummet from highs around $2.30, with the 10-day SMA at $2.29 and the 20-day EMA at $2.36, both well above current levels, suggesting further downside potential. Broader market sentiment is mixed, but SAVE's specific challenges, including the failed merger with JetBlue and potential bankruptcy, make it vulnerable to continued declines. For today's session, consider entering a short position around $1.70, with a first target of $1.50 and a second target of $1.30, setting a stop loss at $1.80. Confidence in reaching the first target is high due to the strong bearish momentum and negative news, while the second target carries moderate confidence given potential volatility. Traders should remain cautious and monitor any developments regarding Spirit's financial situation.\n\nME:\n\n> 23andMe Holding Co.

The RSI values are below 40, suggesting the stock is oversold but not yet at a reversal point. The MACD histogram is positive, hinting at potential short-term bullish divergence, but given the broader market's cautious sentiment and ME's low market cap, this may not be enough to reverse the trend. With no recent news to catalyze a change, the stock is likely to continue its downward trajectory. For today's session, consider entering a short position around $0.305, targeting $0.290 as the first target and $0.280 as the second, with a stop loss at $0.315.

Recent price action shows consolidation around $124, with a breakout potential supported by a positive MACD histogram. Given the broader market's cautious optimism, Nvidia's alignment with the tech sector's strength could further bolster its performance.

Despite CEO Michael Dell's share sales, which are part of a planned strategy, the stock remains attractive due to its valuation and potential in the AI server market. Technical indicators reveal a bullish sentiment with the 10-day SMA at $118.30 and the 8-day EMA at $117.43, while the RSI levels suggest moderate momentum without being overbought. The MACD histogram indicates a slight bearish divergence, but overall market optimism, particularly in tech, could drive further gains. Given the broader market's cautious optimism and Dell's sector alignment, I recommend entering a long position around $120.00. Set the first price target at $122.50 with a confidence level of 70%, and a second target at $125.00 with a 60% confidence level, considering potential resistance near these levels.
