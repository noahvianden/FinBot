We go slow and steady for a reason. If you're good enough to have an edge, a loss streak is not going to affect your investment in each trade so severely that you'd suffer large setbacks during bad periods, which would be way more difficult to recover from. And your slight profitability ensures that you're always adding to your account. There is a reason we use small percentages of our balance, such as 0.2-1% risk per trade. Firstly, because we can accept that loss when we are wrong. And second, it gives us a lot of leeway to bounce back from a loss streak. It's the easiest concept to understand if you actually know how to be profitable, all you have to do is manage your risk while using your statistical advantage.\n\nI've seen so many good traders on here who have had long term profitability, blow their account on a single day after a year of disciplined trading.
