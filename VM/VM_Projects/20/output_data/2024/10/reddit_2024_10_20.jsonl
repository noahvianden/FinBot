When the price dipped to $130 on 10/15, my 2 put spreads were in trouble.  I would have lost $700 or more if I had tried to close them.  The only advantage I could take of the bad situation was to roll the short call for a profit:\n\n`Exp   T Strike Price Qty Income  Return`  \n`----- - ------ ----- --- ------  ------`  \n`10/18 C 144.00  0.11   2  -  22  +  118`  \n`10/18 C 137.00  0.58 - 2  + 116`\n\nAnd wait out the time decay.\n\nThree days later, here is the exit on 10/18, when the stock price closed at $137.98:\n\n`Exp   T Strike Price Qty Income  Return`  \n`----- - ------ ----- --- ------  ------`  \n`10/18 C 137.00  0.90   2  - 180   -  64`  \n`10/18 P 130.00  0.02 - 2      4   -  64`  \n`10/18 P 135.00  0.08   2  -  16   + 212`\n\nSo by holding on through the potentially disastrous put credit spreads and rolling the short call position, I ultimately got me to a $202 profit.  That's a lot better than a potential $600 loss.  Phew.\n\nBut notice: The roll to $137 ended up being DOA when the stock recovered. If I had just left the short call position alone, I would have done better by as much as $86.  \n\nI am glad I was smart enough to stay away from the spread, but it is clear that I keep failing to learn a lesson when doing options with volatile stocks like Nvidia: DON'T F\\*\\*K WITH IT.

There will likely be profit taking in this range and should settle out around 140 for some time. At this point it is up to buyers to reload to work at a more solidified climb above 140, or if no buy strength is apparent at first, it should pull back to fill138-140 gap, then if it breaks down from 138 should ultimately meet 135.70-136 support. (This is a huge loading zone) \n\nPlays based on prediction:\n- Load on calls right at open. Late november calls with a 141-145 strike. (These have a high potential to remain profitable within the next couple weeks if you dont want to flip same day) \n-Sell these calls in the 142-143 range (sell partial position if strength shows a higher breakout) but ideally be fully out before it falls below 140.50-140.80 range.\n-Watch price action to reload on calls: Partial buys at 138 support, if it drops to test 135.70-136 complete position here. (Buy similar calls as before)\n\nWorse case it does not have the strength to push through ATH as presumed, but with over a month of time and knowingly impressive earnings coming up, there should be reletively low risk of loss on these calls. \n\nDo not purchase an expiration much closer than this, and never hold to same week of expiriration or even past wed/thurs of a week you plan to sell.
