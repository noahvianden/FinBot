{"title": "All In: META's Journey to Shembeta \u2013 Calls Only, No Brakes!", "selftext": "Hello Everyone,\n\nTrading is a journey filled with **wins and losses**\u2014it\u2019s all part of the game. Someone recently asked me how I protect my capital on the downside, and if my **\u201cdirectional gambling addiction\u201d** always pays off. Well, let\u2019s be honest: If there were a secure, foolproof way to bet on the market, we wouldn\u2019t be sitting here doing this, right? I'd probably be **hiking somewhere in Wengen or Interlaken, Switzerland**, enjoying the view.\n\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know me, let me introduce myself briefly. I\u2019m **not a financial advisor**\u2014far from it. I\u2019m a **brain tumor survivor**, and trading equities has become both my **passion and hobby**. Any gains I make, I donate to my **non-profit organization**.\n\nNow, let\u2019s dive into my next analysis on the upcoming **META earnings report**. Will this be the moment where **Zuckerberg-a-ta** grins with joy\u2014or not? Here's my take.\n\n# Trend and Channel Analysis:\n\n* **Ascending Channel**: META is currently trading within a well-defined **upward channel**, indicating a strong **bullish trend** over the past few months. The stock has been consistently making **higher highs and higher lows**.\n   * **Upper resistance**: Around **$600\u2013605** (near the top of the channel). The stock recently hit **$602.95** before pulling back slightly.\n   * **Lower support**: The lower boundary of the channel is currently near **$540\u2013550**. This suggests that if the stock sees any pullback, it could find support at those levels.\n\n# Moving Averages:\n\n* **8-day EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**: Currently at **$581.16**, META's price is slightly below this level at **$573.25**. This suggests the short-term trend might have weakened temporarily, but not broken.\n* **21-day EMA**: This moving average provides stronger support around **$573.29**. The price is **hovering close to this EMA**, meaning that a rebound from here would signal continued bullish momentum.\n* **200-day SMA**: Sitting at **$496.64**, far below the current price, indicating that META is well above its long-term support and remains in a **strong uptrend**.\n\n# Stochastic RSI (Momentum Indicator):\n\n* **Current level**: 23.79, which indicates **oversold conditions**. This suggests that the stock might be near a **reversal point**, with potential for an upward bounce if buyers step in soon. However, it\u2019s not yet confirmed, so the next few days will be crucial.\n\n# MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):\n\n* The **MACD line** is still above the **signal line**, but the histogram shows signs of weakening momentum (declining green bars). This could indicate that bullish momentum is slowing, and there may be a period of **consolidation** or minor pullback unless strong earnings or catalysts boost the stock.\n\n# Key Levels to Watch:\n\n* **Support**:\n   * Short-term: $570 (near the 21-day EMA).\n   * Lower support: $540\u2013550 (bottom of the channel).\n* **Resistance**:\n   * Immediate resistance: $600\u2013605 (recent high).\n   * If META breaks above $605, it could lead to a strong **breakout** with the next target in the **$620+** range.\n\nWith earnings coming soon, the stock is likely to experience **volatility**. Given the current position within the ascending channel, the **risk/reward** looks balanced. A move above **$600** on positive earnings could extend the rally, but any disappointment might lead to a pullback to the **$550** level.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ihfrhwwxb7xd1.jpg?width=1534&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5975255afc9240c3f0b785113a57dd448507617f\n\n", "id": "1gd040q", "created_utc": 1729992625.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 9 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 239 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://i.redd.it/rxl2him9vfud1.png) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gd040q/all_in_metas_journey_to_shembeta_calls_only_no/) \n**Account Age** | 5 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.45989930629730225}, {"body": "You had me at \u201cbrain tumor\u201d.

As soon as you reach 10% loss, your account is closed and you lose the fees you paid.  You have to start all over again.\n\nThe frequency of their payouts means little when your account keeps getting closed.\n\nWith most firms, you need to pass 2 challenges before you can earn a payout.  They don't give you payouts during those 2 trial periods.  The trial periods are referred to as \"demo\" and \"simulated\" trading.  The trial periods don't count toward your payouts.\n\nSo how long does it take to get through those 2 trial periods?  If you go conservative, with just 1x the S&P (1:1), with no leverage (no margin), you need to earn 10% profit in your 1st trial, and 8% profit in your 2nd trial.  So you need to earn 18% before you get to the 3rd stage where you actually start making real money.\n\nHow long will it take you to earn that 18% you need to get to the real money?  The S&P's historical average is 7% to 10% per year.  It can take you almost 2 years to complete your trial periods and be qualified to trade real money.\n\nBut 10% drawdowns on the S&P are more frequent, coming every few months lately.  Chances are very high you will reach 10% down before you reach 18% up, and your account will be closed.  You lose all your fees, and you then have to start your trials all over again.\n\nAnd if you increase your leverage to reach that +18% faster, you also risk reaching -10% faster too.  You need 18% to win, but just 10% to lose.\n\nIt's like a casino.  The odds are in the house's favour.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "TLDR, you are talking out of your ass", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If you didn't read it, how would know where I was talking from?

{"title": "Earnings plays (Part 1) - 10/28-11/01", "selftext": "Fellow regards,\n\nNext week is one of the busiest earnings weeks for this year with >150 S&P 500 companies reporting Q3 earnings. It's also time for making the biggest plays to get that elusive 5-20x returns!\n\nNow the important question is which ones to play to make money and limit losses? I did some research/TA and found few interesting plays which are worth looking into. All my plays are based on TA/past earnings insights. My goal is to keep most of the plays with $200-$500 (exceptions big tech), so that even if I am wrong, I am not busting my entire account on couple of plays. \n\nThis is part 1 of the series focusing on earnings of 10/28 and 10/29 (bmo). \n\nOf course, do your own research and don't blindly follow any regard like me online. I work in Wendy's and eat crayons for dinner.\n\n**1. VFC**: Another regard did an entire post on this company, so I won't go into details. Based on its chart, I am bearish to neutral on it. It has recently broken its uptrend and is now heading for gap fill at $14. So this is my plan:\n\n* Buy 2 15p Nov15, 2024: $100 \n* If you want to hedge and save your dick in this pumps, buy 20c Dec20, 2024: $50 \n* **Expected profit: $200/200%** (excl. hedge)\n\n[VFC has broken the uptrend and looks good for $14 gap fill](https://preview.redd.it/eua4kpqf8dxd1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d1ca94e55b0c6b093518cc464bb360625ef77ba)\n\n**2. PYPL:** One of WSB old favorites!! This has been on a strong upward run since end of July with \\~40% up. However, the chart looks overextended in short term with 50 SMA close to 75 and gap fill around \\~74. Also showing bearish divergence with RSI trending lower and price going up! I am bearish on it for the short term.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n* Buy 70p Dec20, 2024: $110 (buying more time in case this goes up for short term but turns down after election)\n* To hedge, buy 100c Dec20, 2024: $70 \n* **Expected returns: $122/112%** (excl. hedge)\n\n[Pypl gap fill at $74 ](https://preview.redd.it/ewi5ylohkdxd1.png?width=1899&format=png&auto=webp&s=81fceffa17008fa1842c12b2c2b09c05b2e7d0ec)\n\n**3. RCL:** Royal Caribbean is a monster stock and money printer for the last few years. Unlike CCL and NCLH, this is one of the best cruise stock to own. While I like this company, it's setup is very similar to PYPL. Overextended on the short term, bearish divergence on RSI, gap fill at $185. I am bearish on it for the short term.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n* Buy 180p Nov15, 2024: $170 \n* To hedge, buy 220c Nov1, 2024: $75 \n* **Expected profit: $284/171%** (excl. hedge)\n\n[RCL gap fill at $184](https://preview.redd.it/si10wtbapdxd1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=b902040d2d3ee469918ee04035e6ceab89757b70)\n\nI will be posting my positions in comments on Monday morning when I buy these options.
