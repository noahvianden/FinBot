{"title": "MSFT Jade Lizard anyone?", "selftext": " Hey everyone,\n\nI've been looking at the current setup for MSFT, and I noticed the implied volatility (IV) is quite high. It seems like MSFT is primed for a bounce from its current level, which makes it an interesting time to consider a Jade Lizard strategy.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with it, the Jade Lizard is a neutral to slightly bullish options strategy that combines a short put and a short call spread. It benefits from high IV, which increases the premium collected, and also gives us a limited upside risk.\n\nIn this case, I'm looking at several MSFT setups, all of which show a pretty impressive Probability of Profit (POP), some in the 85-88% range! Given that the stock looks like it could be bouncing off support, and with high IV adding to the premium, this might be a great opportunity.\n\nHere\u2019s why I think the Jade Lizard is a great choice here:\n\nHigh POP: With the high POP in this case, there\u2019s a good chance the trade will end profitably, or at least break even.\n\nLimited Risk: The short call spread caps the upside risk while the short put provides a chance to collect premium as long as MSFT doesn't crash significantly.\n\nMaximizing High IV: The elevated IV on MSFT means richer premium, and with this strategy, we can take advantage of that without taking on unlimited upside risk.\n\nTake a look at the PnL and delta profiles in the images. The setup looks solid, but I\u2019m curious to hear what others think. Is anyone else running Jade Lizards in this kind of high IV environment?
