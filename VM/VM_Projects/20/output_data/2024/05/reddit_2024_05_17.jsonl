I assume this is mostly because investors rush in to buy options at the last possible moment to keep the play focused purely on the results.\n\nIn my experience I've found that ATM theta and vega more or less neutralize each other on that last trading day. In other words, the value lost to the passage of time is gained back by the increase in IV for ATM options.

If you buy the ATM call at 100 at 10:00 and the stock goes down 2 by 3:30, that option will lose a substantial amount of value heading into earnings because it's now 2% OTM.\n\nI've put this into practice in the past by buying an ATM straddle or guts early in the day and then selling it near the end. The idea is that you might see a move big enough for the straddle to gain during the day. And even if it doesn't move at all, you can just about get your money back.

Is it worth it to wait for a dip to buy a LEAPS? Buying during a market downturn can mean getting LEAPS at a cheaper price,\u00a0potentially increasing your return on investment if the stock price rebounds. A lower entry price reduces your potential losses if the stock price continues to decline in the short term. But you don't have to wait for a dip in the market, you can wait for a dip in the stock you are looking to buy as well. It depends on why the dip occurred of course, you don't want to buy a falling knife.\n\nSometimes the stock you are looking to add a position in, might not experience a significant dip,\u00a0and you could miss out on potential gains if the price continues to rise without that dip. \n\nPredicting market movements is pretty much impossible.\u00a0There's no guarantee the price will dip before potentially continuing its upward trend. \n\nSo, yes, buying the dip would be ideal if you could predict or identify it. The second part is which stock/s to buy. That is the million dollar question. If you find someone to let you know which stocks to buy let me know. But seriously, it is the most difficult part of being an investor. I just do my best to learn as much about a company and try to understand it and how it measures up to its peers/competition. \n\nHopefully some of this was helpful. Either way, best of luck to you.
