Once at full ramp, decide based on FSD's progress if it is better to stay with only the FSD version or if it is better to roll out the low cost version instead.

Do what you want idiots.\n\nShort seller Bleecker Street put out a report today calling out LAC\u2019s Thacker pass lithium mine as being economically non viable. I think it\u2019s stupid.\n\nhttps://www.bleeckerstreetresearch.com/research/lac\n\nTheir point about the capital requirements of DOE loans is a good one, and I do believe LAC will dilute shares more to raise the required capital. So near term stock price is going to drop.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing, lithium as a supply chain in the US is incredibly far behind china, who\u2019s been building roads, harbors, and mines around the world under their Belt and Road initiative for a decade now. It just takes a really long time to get lithium production going, and to refine it at scale. Right now we\u2019re using all chinese lithium and it\u2019s dirt cheap because there\u2019s been a slowdown in EV and battery investment, and also probably because that lithium relies on some slave labor.\n\nMentioned in the bleecker st letter is Gangfeng Lithium (Chinas largest lithium miner)\u2019s recently cancelled Sonora mine project.  Mexico cancelled their permit not because clay mining wouldn\u2019t work (it will), but because Mexico sees the strategic importance of owning their lithium reserves, and not handing them over to china.  The us also obviously sees this.\n\nMining lithium is also energy and cost intensive, and so far the reserves people have gone after have been the easiest ones, brine based reserves in South America primarily. but that\u2019s not where most of the lithium is. It\u2019s mostly in clay, and a lot of that clay is in Thacker pass.  \n\nAnd we need TONS of lithium for any meaningful energy transition to happen. Industrial scale battery projects are happening, not just EVs. And there are absolutely ZERO manufacturers of lithium battery cells in the US.  \n\nPolicy wise, I think once it\u2019s viable to build batteries with US lithium, it\u2019s going to be made advantageous by the Us government both through tariffs and incentives - see the IRA, there is already a 10% investment tax credit for using American made products in energy projects. Meaning if you want to install an industrial scale battery, the government will GIVE YOU 10% of your PROJECT COSTS (not just the battery costs) back as a check if it\u2019s majority american made, today. Well like I said, today there are zero US battery manufacturers that can claim that majority US made component. Not even Tesla, because their lithium is refined elsewhere.\n\nLAC is going to be the recipient of the department of energy\u2019s largest ever loan to a lithium mine, so they already have the government support to carry them through to production and let\u2019s be honest, they\u2019ll get what they want from the government to make the lithium flow.\n\nSo Bleecker street\u2019s statement that the NPV of this Thacker pass project is based on lithium going up in price is technically true, but it\u2019s not really that important. We\u2019re all going to be powering our houses from solar power stored on US mined, refined, and manufactured lithium in a decade, and most of that lithium is going to come from Thacker pass.\n\n\nTLDR; LAC is going to drop to a low in the next year or so before becoming incredibly profitable when production ramps up by 2028 because supply chains and Winnie the Pooh\n", "id": "1cz978o", "created_utc": 1716514003.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 3 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 3 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 9 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.053074054419994354}, {"body": "Los Angeles Clippers?", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Puts on the owner for extending frail kawhi", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Is this owner racist?", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.207296222448349}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2913046181201935}, {"body": "lol", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14672280848026276}, {"body": "Chargers", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4655502736568451}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23894265294075012}, {"body": "Nice DD, but man, you left out another big reason we're gonna need more lithium.
