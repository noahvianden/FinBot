Effectively this is a tax abatement. \n\nSite Acceptance Testing will be complete during 2Q24.\n\nMinimum throughput for Gen 2 is 1350 units per hour is confirmed but they already tested at 1650 units per hour.\n\nSigned a development agreement with a top 5 cellphone OEM.\n\nSampling to 6 of 8 top cellphone OEMS.\n\nEX-1M w/ 18% more energy density vs graphite will ship 2Q24. EX-2M is expected to increase by 30% and will ship before year end 2024.\n\nAnticipate further cost reductions of 35MM per year and Gen 2 cost will go down as more lines are added.\n\nOn the earnings call the Chief Financial Officer commented, they have a long runway before they\u2019d need to raise capital and they wouldn\u2019t do it at the current stock price. Nor would the board allow it.\n\nHe also mentioned they\u2019ve gotten unsolicited interest from governments and Sovereign Wealth Funds indicating a desire to provide funding if Enovix sets up a fab in their country. \n\n* Added info: this is a show me story that continues to de-risk as management continues to deliver. Despite that there is an intransigent short base that is approximately 30% of the float currently.\n\n", "id": "1cjnayf", "created_utc": 1714781804.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 15 minutes ago\n**Total Comments** | 1 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09196139872074127}, {"body": "Why do you regards post this after it has already pumped?
