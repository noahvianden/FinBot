We have Amazon Graviton, and whatever Google is cooking up, but so far there's no real challenge for AMD/Intel coming from the ARM side for now at a grander market scale. The only real competitor was supposed to be Nuvia, which consisted of ex Apple / Google engineers that designed their previous employers SoCs. But Nuvia got bought by Qualcomm a couple years back, and we have not heard about the desktop/DataCenter projects after they got acquired. There were whispers of it being canned due to scaling issues, but nothing firm.\n\nEither way, the DataCenter may take a decade or two  to transition away from x86(if it ever does happen) because rewrites/architecture ports take time & engineering effort. Modern languages alleviate the whole care about the underlying architecture, but most of the software out there is legacy and not running on more modern stacks. So if the codebase is written in say C/C++ it will be significantly harder to migrate than say Microsoft's C#, or Apple's Swift codebases.\n\nA lot of my bearishness on the matter comes from the eagerness of analysts thinking \"ARM is the second revolution of computing\" when in reality, there's not much benefit to be gained outside of power savings from switching to ARM.

New phones might have 4-6GB more ram to pack in 3-7B models in q4-q8.\u00a0\n- RAM speed. The more bandwidth you have, the faster is your inference generally\u00a0\n- battery life. NPUs aren't hugely quicker at matmul than gpu's in phones, but they probably will do it more power efficiently.\u00a0\n\n\nWill it move phones, when everyone already has internet? It might, but other chip companies such as Samsung and Mediatek will have similar NPUs quickly.\u00a0\n\n\nOk, so what about laptops? Qualcomm made many attempts at capturing this market and failed. And I feel like they will probably fail again. How good will x86 virtualization be? Probably not like Rosetta.\u00a0\n\n\nI think Micron, Samsung, Dell, HP, Intel and and AMD have more upside from mobile inference, but given that for all of those companies, this would be a low revenue market in terms of their other products, I don't see it moving prices too much.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Alright let's unpack this. \n\nThe latest phones are shipping with 12gb of ram, and this most likely gets driven up. A 4b parameter model quantized to 4 bits can easily run circles in there. So phone hardware seems very likely capable of running more and more capable hardware. \n\nWhen you consider how much ai inference people will use, ie your ai is listening to everything going on and reacts to things, or even processes and stores for later use, there isn't enough compute in data centers by several orders of magnitude to be able to handle this. Not to mention robots and self driving cars. \n\nRe the move from x86 to arm, apple moved 4 years ago now, do you really think they have some magic that will keep emulation solely working in their hands forever? No man, eventually the performance difference between chips becomes so big, the penalty from poor emulation disappears, and the more time passes the more likely emulation performance improves. We will find out really soon if it's bullshit or not but everyone seems convinced it isn't. \n\nRe samsung and mediatek, they have been trying to catch up to qualcom in the mobile space and they are still years away. If you throw in desktop and server computing we are talking a decade. Amd and Intel probably switch to arm before those 2 have competitive products. \n\nWe are moving into a new world of compute dominance, that's undeniable. Ai will dominate and it needs compute in a way we haven't seen in a long time. This isn't about your wsb posts loading faster, it's about having an ai that can do your job for you and make you money, for example. My theory here is that we are maybe 1 year away from the mobile phone, and other soc hardware becoming the dominate form of compute. The world won't be changed by the 200k h100 nvidia gpus giving everyone a couple minutes of ai per day, it will be changed by billions of devices all crunching unique workloads 24/7.
