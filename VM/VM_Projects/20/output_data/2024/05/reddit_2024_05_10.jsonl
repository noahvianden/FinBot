But it's complicated due to two key factors.\n\nFirst, the \"last\" price was the last disagreement in the marketplace. It was the most recent price at which one party thought the stock was worth more and another though it was worth less. They met at a price and transacted. After that, without any other circumstances, it is assumed that it's equally as likely for the next trade to be up as it is to be down. That's where the 50% baseline concept comes from.\n\n*However*, the basis of any investment has to be gauged against the prevailing risk-free rate of return. This is the rate it's assumed the stock will change over time (\"drift\") and is fundamental to pricing theories like Black-Scholes. In other words, why would anyone buy an investment that has an expected value below this rate or sell one that has an expected value above this rate? As a result, while the likelihood of a directional move up is 50%, the magnitude of an expected move up will be larger than directional moves down. Over time it's expected that the underlying price will drift upwards at the risk-free rate or else you'd short the stock and buy Treasuries.\n\nThat being said, we've observed over time that the market exceeds the risk-free rate in the long run.

{"title": "CSP Strategy - Critique My Strategy (70% 1 YR, 20% YTD, 13% 3-MTD, 2% 1-MTD)", "selftext": "I been CSPing since 2020, brought my accounts from 120k to 240k and back to 80k when I did not close my positions early enough from 21 - 22.\n\nI took a break from my accounts beginning of 23 and started again mid 23 - rethinking a better way I can make sure I do not get assigned on what I am selling.\n\nBefore anyone says this is because we have been rallying - yes it's true. However I held CSP positions in the stock I trade that went to doo doo, but I sell at least 20% OTM, that gives 1.5% premium of the Strike Price. This has saved me.\n\nNote: I sold TSLA, COIN, INTC, RIOT, DIS but I been sticking with GME for the past 8 months. It is very easy to get burned if you fly too close to the sun - but if you choose a CSP just right, and close not waiting until expiration - you let the premiums compound for a red day to sell.\n\n---\n\nHere is my strategy. Please feel free to critique it:\n\nI am going to share my Google Sheet that helps me pick my CSPs: [Google Sheets | Options Strategy](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eAUJmKnquYO4ayiWLGPl0VMnI4TO7gAPAW29QZ3YPLw/edit#gid=0)\n\n1. I go off the weekly charts (High, Low, Change)\n\n2. Based on the average performance, I take the average change and calculate a potential low of what the stock can go to the following 1-week, 2-week, or 3rd-week.\n\n3. Whatever the potential low is, I choose a Strike Price furthest away from this with a 1.5% premium of the strike price. For example, if the potential low is $10.36, I choose a strike price below $10, that gives me 1.5% premium. So if the $9 gives me $0.13 - that is the CSP I choose to sell. (or $0.26 2-weeks out, or $0.39 3-weeks out)\n\n4. I try to wait for the Potential Low (R column), before I enter a position to maximize the lowest that nets me the 1.5% premium I am looking for.\n\n5. I am using the CSP premium and opening more CSP positions after. I also CSP on Fidelity because of that sweet monthly dividend they give to us on all cash held in the account (this includes the premiums from CSPs added to our accounts) - which I use for CSPing as well.\n\n\\*That 25% 1-yr performance on the Traditional account was because I held shares in TSLA, COIN. But I sold them, and completely went CSP after.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8w6bab2xhzc1.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=adad1b528318e6264fa45697c6f3fc2268ad1d41\n\nYou can test this how this performs, but copying the Google Sheet and changing U2 (Symbol) to the stock you were wanting to CSP. Compare the potential\u00a0 price of N2, O2, P3, to the following 1, 2, 3-week close to see if your CSP would be assigned. Sometimes it will be - but I want to stress I do not wait until my CSP expires.
