{"title": "Suggestions on Covered Call and Naked Put strategy", "selftext": "I've been collecting premiums on selling covered calls and cash covered naked puts (both ATM) on $AMD over last 2-3 months. My forecast for $AMD was bullish or sideways. As you might already know, $AMD has been on a rally. Whenever it would rally up, I would roll up the naked Put. For the covered call, I would get the stocks called away with a capped profit potential and re-enter the stock later. In both the cases, I made some decent money by selling ATM weeklys which sell at a nice premium due to its elevated IV. I go with risky ATM because their theta decay is the most.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile I would have made more money by simply buying the stock by capturing the full rally, this way I was better off for the time the stock was trading sideways for about three months. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy question to you guys is what **expiration date** and **profit percentage** I should go for?   \nTastytrade advocates selling options that are about 45-50 DTE and selling them at 50% of max profit.   \nSo far I've been selling weeklys and was rolling them out **every** Friday.
