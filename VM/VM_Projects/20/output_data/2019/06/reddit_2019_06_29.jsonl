Then the tax cuts came in and the President initiated a bill to spend more money on the military. The combined effect of the two boosted GDP artificially above something that would cause panic about a recession.\n\nAdd that companies in 2018 spent a record amount of money on share buybacks. More than dividends, capex or R&D. Which shows that companies don\u2019t have many profitable projects or ventures to invest in. Rather than let the stock price fall, they please investors by buying shares back and making the market look like everything is all good.\n\nOver the last few years the majority of S&P returns have been driven by FAANG stocks (somewhere around 70% contribution to returns). \n\nThe market is not in a healthy place right now. We have had lots of individual days of 2% moves in the US major indices. The market can move that much in one day sure, but there have been many days. Most of the time it\u2019s not new news. For example, the whole trade war with China has impacted the market like this. The threat of a trade war started in 2018 and they are still talking about it today. So multiple days of these moves of news about the same trade deal (more or less) for over a year and a half. This is one of many examples that suggests the market is not healthy.\n\nAfter the financial crises of 2008 the government decided to helicopter drop money into the system through quantitative easing but most of that money ended up back in the stock market, inflating prices.\n\nStudent debt is massive and is starting to put pressure on the holders of that debt. Someone (forgive me I can\u2019t remember) figured out a way around the whole sub prime loan problem in the used auto car space and that has slowly been climbing. And then there\u2019s all the other debt out there, and debt levels are probably excessive since interest rates have been kept low for so long.\n\nThe Fed can\u2019t even raise rates because it will send our economy into a frenzy (probably because of the debt problem).\n\nChina is slowing down in general, and now faces a trade war. If our government and other governments can figure out how to stop them from stealing intellectual property then that will continue to put pressure on their economy. \n\nI\u2019m pretty sure the EU is facing pressure as some economies are slowing down. \n\nI have some friends that have been talking about how their fees and lack of projects are putting downward pressure on their profitability. Add in that unemployment is at historically low levels, suggesting that many companies are going to face the same problem soon, if not already.\n\nInflation has been kept artificially low thanks to companies like Wal-Mart and Amazon who fight rising prices. \n\nThanks for actually asking instead of being rude.
