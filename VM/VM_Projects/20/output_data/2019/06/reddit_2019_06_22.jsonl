You could easily turn it off as a pilot, if you were actually shown which switch it was or if the manual shows you. Tons of pages were removed from the manual by Boeing for some reason and the MCAS is only reference one, in the glossary. So yeah, the pilots could have easily got the plane under control. But then again, when you don't what MCAS does, it's glitches and the fact that u don't know what switch to hit to turn it off, it's Boeing fault.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "The pilots in both crashes, in point of fact, actually did turn MCAS \"off\".... it's just that it turned itself back on... repeatedly... after only a few seconds (not enough time to recover) . And there's a reason for that.  At the end of the day the Max 8 can be stalled with full power out of the more powerful engines.  MCAS *must* be operational in order for the FAA to mandate that the Max 8 isn't a new \"type/model\", which requires additional pilot training in a simulator.\n\nEven without the MCAS issue, there was probably a coffin corner that MCAS introduced by way of a single AoA sensor failure:\n\n- elevator jack screw striction (a problem endemic throughout the 737 series, but made critical in the Max 8 because full nose down trim is require during take off/climb out)\n\n- control surface blow-down that only becomes a problem in high velocity dive (which MCAS introduced)\n\n- nacelle drag increase due to the larger engines (pilots pulled back on the throttles, which brought thrust below the force needed to cancel out the below CG/CL drag, resulting in more nose down pitch)\n\nIn short, a single sensor failure caused MCAS to put two Max 8 aircraft into unrecoverable dives.  It's as simple as that.  The only way to have possibly recovered involved pulling the breaker (turning off the power) to the MCAS computer.  The breakers that can do that are behind the pilots against the cockpit bulkhead; literally one of them would have had to get out of their seat, during what probably was a MCAS initiated zero or negative G maneuver, fond the right breaker out of hundreds and pulled it out by hand.  Could  you imagine a plot flopping around the cockpit bumping into god knows what during that utter chaos?\n\nWatch and see.  I guarantee you that one of the FAA's (Boeing's) fixes will be the relocation of that breaker to a belted in pilot accessible location on one of the cockpit panels.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["ba"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "This means you have not read any of the actual reports.\n\nThe pilots were climbing at an airspeed over 300 knots and did several things strictly forbidden by company policy....
