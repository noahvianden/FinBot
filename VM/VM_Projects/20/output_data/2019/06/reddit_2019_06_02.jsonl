Robert Mueller said he didn't have enough evidence to bring a conspiracy charge, not that there was no evidence. And Mueller didn't even look at trumps finances which is where the evidence would be. \n\nAlmost everything Trump does would lead to the conclusion he is in someway indebted to Russia. Hates NATO, asks Russia to hack the dnc, sides with Putin, implements tarrifs that will destroy the economy, blows up the deficit, refuses to sanction Russia or secure the elections. Well I could go on, but it just never stops. \n\nWhat's the upside here? This is all 5D chess and the god emporer and his party of Flintstone IQ cultists are going to save us?
