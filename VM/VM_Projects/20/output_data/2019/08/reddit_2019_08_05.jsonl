{"title": "Bailie Gifford, major TSLA shareholder, comments on the transition to EVs", "selftext": "", "id": "cmdwit", "created_utc": 1565025628.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "**Transition to Electric Vehicles**\n\n>*Another part of the global economy where we expect to see  significant transformation over the next decade is the transportation  sector. It is an area which has seen little change since the Ford Model T  started rolling off the production line over 110 years ago. People  still buy cars, fill them up with petrol, and then drive them from A to  B. But there are some major problems with this model. Firstly, petrol is  a hydrocarbon, and it is probably not in society's best interests that  we keep burning hydrocarbons at the rate we have been doing  historically. Secondly, car ownership is inefficient with the average  car being used only about 5% of the time. Given that Americans  collectively spend around US$1 trillion per year on their cars this low  capacity utilisation represents a huge waste of resources. Finally,  humans are fallible - we are easily distracted, which leads to  accidents. Tragically, 1.4 million people are killed every year on roads around  the world, making road traffic injuries one of the ten leading causes  of death across all age groups and the leading cause of death in young  people between the ages of 5 and 29 years.*  \n>  \n>*These challenges are not insurmountable, however. There  are three important and parallel technology-driven shifts underway right  now which could reshape the transportation sector over the coming  decades. These are: (1) the transition from petrol engines to electric  vehicles ('EVs'); (2) the shift from car ownership to ride-sharing; and  (3) the move from human-driven cars to autonomous vehicles. The exact  slope of the adoption curve for each of these new products is currently  unknown, but the arguments for their mainstream adoption in the long  term are compelling.*  \n>  \n>*Whilst all three of these technology-led evolutions are  currently at a nascent stage, the first - the shift from petrol to EVs -  is most advanced. It sounds strange to say it now, but it was not so  long ago that electric cars were undesirable. Tesla has, pretty much  single-handedly, made electric cars cool. EVs are fast, safe, clean and  increasingly affordable. Whilst true plug-in EVs still represent a small  proportion of annual car sales in the US and globally, the trends are  indicative of a major shift underway. In the US, EVs made up just over  2% of new car sales in 2018 representing an almost doubling of market  share year over year. In California, arguably a leading indicator for  the adoption of new technologies, EVs comprised almost 8% of new vehicle  sales last year. The astonishing fact that the Tesla Model 3 was the  best-selling car in the US by revenue based on the last four quarters,  coming in ahead of the Toyota Camry, perhaps marks a major milestone on  the coming transformation of the car industry and the end of our  reliance on a major finite resource.*", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "> The astonishing fact that the Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling car in the US by revenue based on the last four quarters, coming in ahead of the Toyota Camry, perhaps marks a major milestone on the coming transformation of the car industry and the end of our reliance on a major finite resource.\n\nNote they are not including trucks and SUVs as \"cars\".", "score": -13, "replies": [{"body": "noted", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05350314825773239}, {"body": "They also did not include TVs as cars.

A decade and a half ago progress in autonomous  driving technology was being led by a select number of academic  institutions like Stanford and Carnegie Mellon. However, the centre of  gravity has shifted to the commercial space with Alphabet's Waymo, Tesla  and Aurora arguably leading the way, albeit with quite different  approaches. We have exposure to all three of these companies in the  Company, the most recent investment being Aurora, which is an unquoted  company founded by the former head of Waymo, Chris Urmson. We believe  broad exposure to this area is appropriate given the potential scale of  its impact. There is no consensus on when true autonomy will become  mainstream which is not surprising given the enormous range of edge  cases that any system will have to deal with (e.g. roadworks, snow), but  most would agree that the remaining problems are solvable, and it will  not be that long until we are being driven around by computers.*  \n>  \n>*Ride-sharing is still quite expensive on a per-mile basis.  Around two-thirds of the total cost is attributable to the driver. By  incorporating autonomous technology into ride-share networks, it is  possible that costs would fall to a level where it would be almost  inconceivable that anyone would want to own a car for practical  purposes. In addition, autonomous software, when deployed at scale,  ought to have the potential to be orders of magnitude safer than human  drivers, leading to a drastic reduction in road fatalities and injuries.  It will also free up time that would otherwise have been spent driving  for productive work and save consumers considerable money. Lyft is  investing significant capital in the development of its own ride-sharing  capabilities and is also working closely with Waymo to trial autonomous  Waymo vehicles on the Lyft network in a small area just outside of  Phoenix, Arizona.*", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "\" Tesla and Aurora arguably leading the way ... \"\n\nwow i did not know Aurora was a front runner", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Shocking that they think the company they have invested in is a front runner really.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5053620934486389}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "They divide the future into 3 themes: EV, ride-sharing, and robotaxis.\n\nUsually I'd say Uber/Lyft are in the best position.
