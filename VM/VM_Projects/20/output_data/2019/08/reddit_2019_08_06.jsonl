You have $187 million remaining on your authorization which actually expires fairly soon in March 1st and you bought back $20.4 million of stock in the most recent quarter. So you obviously have a lot more capacity than you're currently using both on your authorization and your cash that's on the balance sheet, the debt side of your balance sheet is in good shape. I mean I think it would be pretty normal to try to look for some signaling indications in terms of why you haven't used more of that buyback faster. And if I can I do want to ask the question in terms of potential international investments whether any potential international investments would be included in that fiscal 2020 free cash flow number that you've given or if any potential international investments would occur in 2021 or later?\n\nTodd Penegor\n\nHey, John, you've got all the key facts right. You're right. We're sitting at about $226 million of cash, we need on a daily basis about a few $200 million. So we are sitting on more than we need. And so the cash outflows to think about is from the current balance is about $45 million in dividends, we do have to satisfy beginning of 2020. The FY settlement with about $20 million of cash out after tax and we will continue our track record and finish our share repurchase authorization, which is making or going to make a big dent into our cash balance with about $187 million to go.
