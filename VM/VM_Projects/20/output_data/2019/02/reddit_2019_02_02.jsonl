Trying to time the market and constrain the rules of the strategy to only selling options during \"X\" environments kind of violates the rules of the system.\n\nThe rules are the rules for a reason. It's so you can't fuck up and inject your feelings at a given moment into a system that generally works over the long run. That's pretty much the whole point of any rules-based system.\n\nMy advice would be to either learn to be patient and just keep following it, or admit to yourself that you're an impatient person and find a strategy that fits your style better. Whatever system you use, though, you have to be able to follow the rules you set for yourself.
