This is like playing both sides of the fence but from different area codes. What are you even trying to say? I don\u2019t think anyone actually thinks the smartphone is in its final form, Samsung isn\u2019t doing anything here. As a matter of fact, I\u2019d say they\u2019re not doing much in the way of innovation that translates into any real-world market difference, at least for the foreseeable future. Do you know how many people want a thick $3k foldable phone thing? I\u2019ll tell you. Not a lot.

PEOPLE are. People are driving this trend, and even then, so what? Samsung vanishes from the face of the earth tomorrow but smartphone tech will continue upward. And by the way, unless you\u2019ve just come out from a 5-year sleep smartphones have been a STAPLE of everyday life for billions of people. They\u2019re not going to become integral, they are already essential. \n\nPeople negate using almost every other form of tech for just using a phone all the time. The smartphone is not a toy that we're going to lose ever again, let alone Samsung being essential to this process? ..that has already been completed. If someone doesn't have a smartphone, it's not the smartphones fault. Apple or Samsung or insert brand here it doesn't matter. It's either a scaling issue or financial issue. It's not because we don't have a fucking phone that folds in half. You're missing the forest for the trees, and so are thousands of others.\n\nThese new phones could be the latest tick on a chart dude. The S10 is the newest candle. Nothing more. \n\nBut you see the genius? They've distracted people so long now with shiny things that no one realizes they've been sold a pump and dump folding gimmick lmao \n\nInnovation for the smartphone is the end game.
