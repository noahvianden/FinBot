{"title": "Tesla addition to S&P500", "selftext": "Tesla will likely get added to s&p 500 in 4 months. They have had two profitable quarters already, they will likely make small profit this quarter and next quarter is expected to be profitable. That should be enough to get it on the s&p 500. Remember when Twitter was about to be added, in 4 months - the stock more than doubled. Tesla may not increase so much, however i expect it to cross 400 for the first time on addition. The play: own 100 shares for now, will likely add a few 350/370 call spreads when market crashes next.\n\nPS When Tesla first hit 300, it had 2 billion in revenue.
