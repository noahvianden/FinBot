For the purposes of this explanation (to keep things simple) let's just say a share price is determined by it's CASH ON HAND and OTHER.\n\n\nCompany XYZ has a share price of $100. The company decides to give a dividend of $2 per share. Remember, the dividend is actual CASH ON HAND that the company has and is now giving back to shareholders. \n\n\nNow let's take a step back a minute. If we were paying $100 per share for Company XYZ... Why would we also pay $100 per share for Company XYZ AFTER is has given away money? We wouldn't. It doesn't make sense to pay the same price for a share after the company has given away money.\n\n\nSo the next question is, how much does the share price have to drop? Indeed, the share price will drop by the dividend given per share. So in theory, the share should now trade for $98 after a $2 dividend.\n\n\nAfter the dividend, Company XYZ is still worth the 'same.' You still have just as much ownership in the company as before. And despite the lower share price, you should be net even on your transaction. Initially, you had $100 worth in Company XYZ... Now you have $98 in Company XYZ and $2 in dividends (cash).\n\n\nThis all we be fine and dandy except that Uncle Sam views dividends as a taxable event. So you would actually own $98 in Company XYZ and ($2 - taxes) in cash. So you would LOSE money if the underlying company traded for the exact theorized amount.\n\n\nThis is why buying for the dividend and selling won't work. Uncle Sam get's his cut.
