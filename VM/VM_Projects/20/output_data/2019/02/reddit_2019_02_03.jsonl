I'd look at NTNX HUBS/CRM/TWLO NEWR/SPLNK in tech. And if you had a couple hundred to put in high risk cannabis you might find it growing similar to how MSFT did for you.

At several points along the way it seemed to stabilize.  After falling in the last few months of 1929, it found a footing in the early months of 1930.  The stock market even rallied back above 290, a rebound of 20 percent.  And the Harvard Economic Society, which was one of the few outfits to have predicted the recession, now argued that the worst had passed.  Clutching at whatever straws he could find, Hoover seized upon these brief interludes of good news, not realizing they were head fakes.  In June 1930, when a delegation from the National Catholic Welfare Council came to see him to request an expansion in public works programs, he announced, \"Gentlemen, you have come sixty days too late.  The depression is over.\"  That very month the economy began another down leg.\n\n> Eventually, when the facts refused to obey Hoover's forecasts, he started to make them up.  He frequently claimed in press conferences that employment was on the rise when clearly it was not.  The Census Bureau and the Labor Department, which were responsible for data on unemployment, found themselves under constant pressure to fudge their numbers.  One expert quit in disgust over attempts by the administration to fix the figures.  Finally, even the chief of the Bureau of Labor Statistics was forced into retirement when he publicly disagreed with the administration's official statements on unemployment.", "id": "amsalz", "created_utc": 1549218402.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "It's different this time.", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "You're truly naive if you don't believe the govt's been diddling stats to sway public opinion.
