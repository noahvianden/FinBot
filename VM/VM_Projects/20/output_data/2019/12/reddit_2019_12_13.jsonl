They modelled that China demand is only 1/2 that of the USA despite the market being way bigger for EVs.

Basically they have energy topping out at ~$10B and actually they also have auto levelling off in 2025 in and around $80B despite Tesla likely getting there in short order. The whole time he had this posture/face like \u201cmy boss won\u2019t let me go higher\u201d.
