Let's say you saw the brexit referendum results, and the rally that followed and decided 'I'm gonna start stacking cash(didn't sell) waiting for a sell off.    There would have been a huge opportunity cost to that decision.   Just to be clear, there are tons of people that did just that, most that did this won't admit it, but there are always people trying to time the market weather it's retail, or professional, and there is always people pick there spots at any given time.   Now I am not really arguing that there can't be opportunity cost associated with DCA, but the only way to capture it is to successfully time the market, which many would argue is foolish to assume you could do consistently(no offense intended).\n\nHere is the thing, I am not trying to sell you on DCA, just saying this is the reason why it is so appealing.   If you buy the same dollar amount every pay cheque, and lets say you can buy 30 shares per cheque today.   If there is a 20% pullback you would obviously be buying 36 shares instead of 30.    Someone said to you that you should wait for a 50% pullback, and your reply was, well what if it only drops 40%.   This is very similar to saying 'I'm gonna start stacking cash', and someone says to you, 'well what of the market keeps making ATH's for the next three years?'    You may think this is unrealistic, but you really can't predict it..... that last rate cut made everyone go bandana because they assumed after all the hikes, a cut signaled we were in for a world of hurt.    Something similar happened in the 90's.... early 90's had aggressive hikes, only for a pause, and a mid cycle cut in 94-95.    Again a ton of people back then thought the end was nigh, market went sideways for twelve months, and then hit ATH every year for the next four years, and ended up being one of the best bull runs.  Hindsight being 20/20, it is very easy to say 'I wouldn't have been scared out of the market in 95' when all the sky is falling rhetoric was happening, and that you would have in 99 when everyone was slapping each other on the backs with all the gains.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This is insightful, thank you. \n\nI appreciate you taking the time to type this out.

Options are all about timing the market, so that must mean we'll always be beat. WRONG!\n\nThink about it, why does time in the market work? Because stonks only go up, right? Not exactly. By time in the market, the boomers mean sitting on their s&p 500 index funds and cost averaging down. Even if stonks don't only go up, they profit because they bought in the valleys.\n\nSo us autists should be applying boomer logic to our trades, thereby gaining upward titification protection. Stonks don't only go up, but one thing they definitely do is zig zag up and down, this is fact, look at any chart. \n\nSo I propose a foolproof strategy. Treat options like a boomer treats their vanguard etfs. Choose a long term option and buy regularly through the peaks and valleys. You will have to be rewarded greatly, moreso than the boomer and his index, at some point in the options lifetime.\n\nTake TSLA for example. What if you had chose a 400 strike option 2 years ago and kept averaging regularly until now. You'd likely have over 4000% gains. The cost averaging made up for all theta decay and everything.\n\nYou're welcome autists, now get to investing the right way.", "id": "ed2xvt", "created_utc": 1576805383.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "This is fuckin retarded... so retarded it just might work.
