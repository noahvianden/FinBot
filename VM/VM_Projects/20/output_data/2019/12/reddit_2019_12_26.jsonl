{"title": "Selling weekly OTM calls with long-term ATM calls", "selftext": "I posted about this in my own community but wanted to share this as well with the wider options community. \n\n2020 is probably gonna be a great year again for stocks (or at least until Trump is in office). I think that there are some stocks which have already been picked as favorites for hedgefunds such as Disney and Apple for 2020. These blue chips are simply too big to fail, and as we all know, those 401k index fund money bags will keep pouring chips into these names no matter how subpar their actual performance is. Furthermore, with everyone raving about Disney+, I think that we'll see upgrades after upgrades for Disney as each quarter passes (since during ER, disney will tell us about their amazing subscriber numbers and all these toutes will pump them up until there's no tomorrow). Furthermore, unlike what others think, I actually believe that the 250ish billion evaluation for Disney is fair at a PE of 23. Personally, I know many who have raved about Disney+, and as these subscriber levels increase due to Disney's original content, we'll see that Disney will become a clear winner in the space where Netflix used to be a sole player. I still don't think that Apple has enough original content to be able to compete with Netflix and Disney (unless it acquires a major media company such as Sony Pictures). \n\nI think it's a pretty safe bet to say that Disney will have at least an 11% increase over the next year, which is why I will buy calls for Jan 2021 for Disney with strike prices that are pretty much at the money. With that said, after talking to a theta gang captain, I will sell weekly OTM calls during weeks where I see a statistical likelihood that Disney wont have huge price swings. Each week, the theta burn off of your original investment will be much, much less than the theta burn that the weeklies will experience. Furthermore, given that the original option will most likely be in the money after a few quarters of ER, you will most likely make a profit on your original investment on top of the weekly options that you will sell. In case you didn't know of this strat, I would highly recommend it as a way of making a steady income that is not as risky as other options plays. Of course, this doesn't have to be your sole source of generating profits, but I think it is safe to say that it can form a fundamental backbone in your portfolio.\n\nCouple of things that make this strategy particularly effective: rolling over your options by buying back the calls that you've sold in intraday lows and then reselling the same strike price for a week later at intraday highs is a great way to mitigate risk while allowing for higher returns. The fundamental assumption behind this is that you want to pick a stock where you believe that there will be a gradual upside. Ultimately, I think that you will probably gain a much higher return on your investment if you followed this strategy as opposed to simply buying shares in the company. With that said, you have to make sure that you buy the call option back in case it dangerously approaches the point at which it can be exercised. If there is a huge spike, you can buy the call back quite comfortably since your original principal investment also goes up significantly with the price spikes. With that said, I would not recommend selling weekly calls around earnings time. Instead, you can probably sell put credit spreads if you're particularly bullish about the stock which you're doing this strategy with. \n\nWith that said, make sure that you dont run this strat on momentum stocks such as AMD. I think that behemoths in S&P 500 are much better for this strat than mid-cap and small-cap stocks. And please, for the love of god, don't do it on a pharma company (unless that biotech is as stagnant as Gilead or it's a big pharma company such as Merck). Thanks again to the theta gang warrior who originally shared this strategy on reddit.

Capturing your theta and making it neutral. If everything works out, you end up +200% most likely.\n\n2. Assuming OTM weekly = 5%. That's still roughly a 13% return per week if we're best case scenario and never get assigned. \n\nThings I don't like.\n\n1. Where's your underside mitigation? Worst case scenario Dis goes to $100 and you lose your ITM call. Your OTM +5% will yield you roughly 1k which may just barely bring you to $0 loss. Over a year a 0% change is pretty bad, especially if it's a bull market like you and I are thinking.\n\n2. All stocks eventually hit $0. It won't happen next year or in 10, but all companies fail one day. Mitigate your risk somehow. Whether it's a cheap OTM put or keeping your sell:buy ratio of calls together. Even then it'll probably be a steep difference. \n\n3. This is a 16-17k strategy. Minimum yield should be $1,100. Rolling covered calls you might make it there if the stock doesn't go down. Once again, as long as the stock doesn't go down.\n\n\nYou've neutralized theta and actually I believe will end up capturing it for your benefit, but delta is working against you just as much as it's working for you. \n\nCover your underside and this is a good strategy if you have the capital to sell covered.\n\nPlease feel free to address any points I made and correct me if you feel differently.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "That\u2019s very true.

Elon is a freaking money raising machine.\n\n> The money is twice what Morgan Stanley forecast for Tesla\u2019s fiscal-year 2019 capital expenditures and will make Rivian a \u201cserious\" competitor.\n\nSo... by this logic it should be super simple for the Legacy Automakers to pour a few billion into EV tech and surpass both Tesla & Rivian, because they have a lot more cash flow then both of them?\n\n> The analysts say Rivian\u2019s cash haul may be bigger than Ford and General Motors\u2019 combined spending on battery-electric vehicles in 2020 and enough to build a gigafactory in a low-cost country. It\u2019s also enough money to build two or three new models of electric vehicles.\n\n... There's a reason why many cars are often built in high wage countries like the US and EU. It costs a freaking ton of money (and time) to ship fully assembled cars to consumers. Some automakers do it anyway, but the ones who don't aren't fools.\n\n> Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has said the e-commerce giant, which has invested in Rivian, aims to have 100,000 of the vehicles on the road by 2030. \n\n... I know it's talking about just Amazon's delivery vehicles, but 100,000 is a very tiny number when talking about a 10 year time period, especially if you compare it to the annual car sales numbers of most other automakers.\n\n> Tesla controls about 80 percent of the U.S. battery-electric vehicle market, but Morgan Stanley says its current position is \u201cunsustainable long term\u201d and expects a start-up with access to talent and capital to provide the \u201cnext serious competition.\u201d The firm\u2019s analysts also see increased inroads from legacy carmakers.\n\nThis analyst should take a look at what happened to Apple's dominance in the smartphone market. Yes Apple's percentage of the market shrunk overtime, but they make over 80% of the profits in the market. Even the most bullish Tesla projections have their size of the EV market shrinking overtime as more competition comes in, all while Tesla continues to sell more EV's.\n\n> One such threat is the $50 billion merger between Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot, announced in November, which creates the fourth-largest automaker by sales.\n\nYeah, because we all know Apple failed miserably against the Nokia juggernaut. Size doesn't always make your company better.\n\n> At the time the deal was announced, Eric Schiffer, CEO of the Los Angeles-based private-equity firm Patriarch Organization, told FOX Business the deal would create a \u201cblistering degree of competition\u201d over the next five years and \u201cone of the greatest dangers\u201d to Tesla\u2019s survival.\n\nMergers don't create competition, it reduces competition, that's basic economics.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Merging companies can cause uncertainty in the companies, causing delay of decisions, people to leave etc. the merger will cost quite a bit, which is not good for the financial position initially.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22204694151878357}], "tickers": ["aapl", "tsla", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Sorry, had to remove this due to rule 6 violation: link posts must use the original title.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1846914291381836}, {"body": "Essentially they\u2019re saying we believe the competition will catch up later rather than sooner.

When you use the word progress to refer to stock price and the amount of money you have made on your investment, your investment mentality is wrong.\n\nStock investments are a passive investment, and the beauty of them is they make money for you while you sit back and do nothing. The only thing you have to do is make up your mind about how much a stock is worth, and then buy that stock when it is below that value, and sell that stock when it is above that value. Of course this value of what you think the stock is worth can change over time with new developments around the company, both good and bad.\n\nSetting a stop loss is the opposite of what you want to do as a long term investor. Setting a stop loss means that you're going to sell the stock when it is a better deal than before.
