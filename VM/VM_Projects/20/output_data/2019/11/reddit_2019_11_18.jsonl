I understand some of the pocket-size companies can't afford a full development program on their own, which is why they need to build alliances and develop their EV platforms in cooperation. Unfortunately, some of them seem to prefer to bury their heads in the sand and pretend that ICE cars will stay for ever. I have no hesitation to say that some of them won't survive this paradigm shift. Which is a pity, given how many lessons were there to learn from the various tech companies that went bust when they forgot how to innovate.   \n\n\nI know what you're saying about the batteries. I had very similarly strong thoughts in the past. Now, I'm in two minds. I think the first EV ramp-up, which is what we are seeing today will probably be battery-constrained. This is where a huge OEM like VW has thrown its weight around and essentially managed to get a steady supply at good prices. The others I think will have a much tougher time, as exposed by the issues Hyundai and Kia are having with their EV production.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7623764872550964}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6204583644866943}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-and-northvolt-form-joint-venture-for-battery-production-5316", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, good to know.
