How long? I think VW spoke well indicating 2035 as their target goal and I hope they will make the turn earlier but is not going to be an easy fix.

DB is the classic example by managing huge pension funds for the unions and using the same money to finance big industries plans and acquisitions.\n\nThis goes all the way back to German unification (the one in the mid 1800) when the Prussian leadership consolidated their grip on power by establishing \u201cthe System\u201d. A quick search on the net over the connection between German banking system and industry will provide a more detailed and accurate answer. \n\nIn this prospective, Germany bank system is even more intertwined with its industrial and social structure than, if you live in the US, can even imagine.

This is almost engrained in the German society and any changes will require a truly exceptional crisis or a very illuminate leadership. What is different in this situation is the confluence of 3 crisis on the system: industrial, banking and social ( aging population and revolution in the workforce number and skills) at a time when a giant leader (Angela) is leaving.

I had just stumbled on this topic recently. I am in the middle of a geopolitical book by an American author (Peter Zeihan) and he has also brought up the German banking system although without much detail. I believe his example was that to get a home loan you had to create an account and then basically save the equivalent of the mortgage payment for quite a while before getting the loan. In other words, credit can be very tight. I know that Germany in general is known for keeping low national debt levels which is why they were always considered the balance to the Southern states. I'll probably end up looking this up for more info as you suggested.\n\nHis prediction of where the world is going doesn't look very good for Germany who he singles out as particularly at risk. But I'm still on his \\*first\\* book which was 2014 and preceded the auto industry decline, Trump and Brexit, and I'll be curious to catch up to his current thinking because it is rather dramatic. Basically, the combination of demographic aging, American energy independence due to shale oil, as well as general self-sufficiency (the US has a very very low % of import/exports because it is so resource and capital rich itself, but even cheap labor in China has gotten less cheap), and perhaps the continued decline in Russia, all lead us to reducing our role as the kind of global security backbone and focusing more on specific allies that have certain strategic value, and this generally doesn't include Germany or much of Europe at all on the list (though Netherlands and Denmark are). It seems a bit dramatic to imagine a world sort of receding back to the more thorny era before WWII but then most of Trump's foreign policy and populist isolationism fits perfectly into this model, and makes it almost seem inevitable rather than just his peculiarities. \n\nI suppose relevant to Tesla, it's moderately safer for them to be building within Germany than exporting to them.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "It seems an interesting book to read ....
