Then the other 400$ in just some blue chip stocks such as Apple or Walmart or whatever again haven\u2019t made my mind up yet. Then with the 2-3k I have saved up do 1000 in dividend and 1000 in blue chip stocks then 500 ish just to start the index fund. Is this a good kind of plan of investment plan?

She is one of the authors of slightly over 60 papers.  From what I've come to understand over the past few years, the vast majority of the actual meaningful work performed in these studies comes from the primary and secondary authors of the paper.  3rd and 4th authors sometimes provide _really minimal_ input and are even often included for political reasons (and politics in academia play a very large part in pretty much everything).  I have heard of cases where the 3rd of 4th author's name was included on a paper simply because that author was the owner of a particular data-set that the paper used for statistical analysis.  So apart from providing an existing data-set that the primary and secondary authors then did further work on, they didn't necessarily contribute anything _new_ to the studies in question.  I've also heard of cases where the 4th author was only included because he was the promotor of the 3rd author (a PhD student) yet he didn't do _anything_.  He just insisted on being included because of his promotorship.\n\nWhen looking at academic papers, the first and second authors are usually the ones who did the real work, 3rd and 4th are (obviously not in all cases, but it definitely happens frequently) frequently just there because of data-set-owernship or politics.  \n\nSo that part of this video/research, might be a bit of a stretch.  Obviously, I don't know if that applies to the papers that /u/galileorussell has been looking at, but it's something to keep in mind.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "It's a bit more than that---the most important authors are in the beginning---and the end. Depends on the particular field and the type of research: large author experimental biology and chemistry papers are more like this than mathematics or theoretical physics.\n\nThe end authors are the head, or heads of the labs. They are in charge of getting money and setting the overall scientific direction---they are not at all irrelevant to the scientific product.  The first couple of authors are usually more junior students or postdocs who directly perform the bulk of the experiment, middle authors contribute expertise or use of a particular instrument, experimental technique or data analysis, or manuscript editing.  The  senior professors are the ones who (depending on the experience of the first authors) set the general direction or set specific experimental goals and help overcome difficulties.  They know what does not work, and what the \"market\" wants to find and have a broader experience base than the junior authors.\n\nIn this particular paper in question, you can see from the association in the author list that it is a collaboration between Professor Meng's lab at UCSD and the Army Research Lab; the last two authors then are the heads of the labs at UCSD and ARL.\n\n[http://smeng.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/A-carbonate-free-sulfone-based-electrolyte-for-high-voltage-Li-ion-batteries.pdf](http://smeng.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/A-carbonate-free-sulfone-based-electrolyte-for-high-voltage-Li-ion-batteries.pdf)\n\nWhat I see as being an important and maybe under-appreciated consideration here: what if LNMO cathodes become real and deployed?  First, yes, there is no cobalt.  Other electrodes coming into production are 811 NMC, meaning 8 parts nickel to 1 part manganese and one part cobalt, reducing cobalt requirements.\n\nBut moreover, look at the composition from the abstract of that paper.\n\nNickel is 0.5 by composition and Mn 1.5.   So 3 times as much manganese as nickel.  Cobalt is 2x the price of nickel, but nickel itself is still pretty expensive.  It's one of the expensive parts of stainless steel (along with chromium), even smallish amounts of nickel and chromium in iron-carbon based standard steel increase the price substantially.\n\nThe cost burden of nickel in standard Lithium ion batteries is substantially higher than lithium.\n\nweb search today: commodity cobalt is $33000 per metric ton nickel is about $17000 per metric ton, manganese is about $2000 per metric ton.  Now battery-grade purity requirements make it a bit more complex but the rough scaling should apply.  So Mn is much cheaper than Ni, and the LNMO cathode in that paper has a minority of nickel and more manganese.\n\nWhat's more, manganese's mass density is a little bit less than nickel.\n\nOverall, if LNMO cathodes with this ratio can be commercialized, they would reduce battery cell costs notably.  It doesn't seem like that even in R&D results (best possible conditions often) the lifetime is yet as good as a high quality NMC, but if that can be improved enough (e.g. to where Tesla's current NCA batteries are, i.e. good enough for personal use, maybe not semi or energy storage or robotaxis) it would substantially reduce the commodity price burden, and then the processing costs & capital come into play more.  And the Maxwell technology helps there.\n\nBTW, the Goodenough & Braga's results with solid electrolyte system have huge skepticism in the scientific community.  Maybe to the point that they think it may be fraud (assumed to be Braga or other co-authors?).  I wouldn't count on that technology (which is completely disconnected from conventional Lithium ion cells) working any time soon for commercial uses.

Volume and enthusiasm is really high.\n\nIt has yet to rest at a base, but it'll likely find one soon and stall for awhile. And AMD tends to settle at only one base then fluctuate until the next news event, instead of steadily rising from base to base. This will become its support level. Its base could be higher or lower from here. We're in what is called no man's land right now. It could go up or down a lot. Once it finds a base, it has to rise again so it can find resistance, or if its base is lower from here then maybe its resistance could be 41.5 or so. Once all that happens, we'll have a clearer picture on how to trade AMD. Currently it's just gambling. \n\nHowever, there are some interesting facts about AMD. Its rise isn't financial based, it's entirely news based and expectation based. This leaves them open to fall down a lot if competition releases anything that beats them or they don't prove anything in ERs. They're also open to the trade war.
