If you plan on buying and holding for 30+ years, technically your entry point is irrelevant, unless we have a big recession like -50%, but even then you'd make a lot of money in the long term.\n\nAlso, in all markets there are opportunities. We must observe, analyze, learn and adapt. There is always value to be found in all markets.\n\nWith all of the said, it would be foolish to ignore all the short-medium term risks.

The Warren Buffet index is currently very high, we're almost at the tech bubble level (a bit lower currently).\n* Corporate growth has slowed.\n* Fed has bailed out the repo market recently and plans to continue to do so until January 2020. It says that it's not QE, but yeah... \n* Negative interest rates in some counties.\n* Struggling European economy, especially Germany that has been the main contributor to the European economy.\n\nAlthough this does not mean the market will crash soon, the risks of a downside in the stock market in the couple months is not negligible. A lot of big investors are sitting on cash, although most of them don't predict a recession (they can't say it publicly because it would cause a panic and a sell-off, which would be a self fulfilling prophecy). Currently Warren Buffet (Berkshire) is sitting on more than 120 billions dollars of cash, the highest amount they ever held. Now interpret that any way you want.\n\nTLDR: Long term, don't worry.

They'll be able to plan and provision accordingly. For the Model 3 reservations there was no configurator and Tesla was in the dark about the distribution of various options.\n- Early reservations with the Model 3 were rewarded poorly, and there was somewhat of a community backlash over that. By enabling the Model Y configurator early on, Tesla is putting a lot more substance behind their Model Y promises. There's also financial rewards to early adopters: prices, including that of the FSD price, will be honored even if the price goes up meanwhile. This might be worth a $1,000-$2,000 price advantage early next year.\n- The ordering of orders is also much more clear: Performance and AWD units will probably be filled the earliest, SR+ the latest - but other than that and some early geographical ordering (California before farther away locations) it's pretty predictable, and IMO there will be a lot less heartburn about people 'jumping the queue' - which happened with the Model 3.\n\nBut because a $2,500 commitment and an actual configuration step is very different from a vague $1,000 pre-order, the two order queues are not comparable - nor would Tesla want to disclose such proprietary information, unless it's some ridiculously high number (which it probably isn't).\n\nI'd guess the Model Y might have a couple of ten thousand pre-orders at this stage - this might further increase as the Model Y sightings (and the FSD price increases) continue.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.022918473929166794}, {"body": "Under promise over deliver.

I'd love to be wrong. \n\nYeah, that's wrong:\n\n- The Fremont SR+ price was 377k RMB - and it is now 328k RMB, a 15% price drop. That's significant, and there were probably quite a few sales deferred waiting for that lower price.\n- The China Model 3 will probably be eligible for EV subsidies, which despite their reduction in July is still substantial and represent a sales price subsidy of about another 25k RMB (not a tax credit), which directly improves the price by another 8% for every Tesla buyer, not just for those who have tax liabilities. 303k RMB versus 377k RMB is big - and most of the ICE competitors in the luxury/premium segment have entry prices just around 300k RMB.\n- The China Model 3 is now the only SR+ Chinese customers are able to buy in China, which gives a guaranteed sales stream. In the U.S. about 50% of the sales are SR+ - but the Chinese market is more price sensitive.\n- Given that the Fremont SR+ included import duties of 25%, despite the 15% lower price margins will probably increase by at least 10%, plus lower currency devaluation risks.\n\nRamping up China production and deliveries will nevertheless be a challenge: current levels of sales are about 1k/week max, and GF3 has a capacity of 3k/week. This means that both demand and the delivery network has to be expanded to 300% of its current size, including service centers and Supercharging access.\n\nThe locally made Model 3 will also probably cannibalize some of the higher trim sales - so while margins on those SR+'s might improve, the margins on the higher trims and S/X might go down, and Tesla will have to scale up to counteract those forces.\n\nGF3 is a non-trivial expansion.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You forgot improved margins through cheaper capital, cheaper labor, no shipping costs, more efficient product lines, maybe cheaper parts, after the ramp is done mic model 3 is a cash machine..", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, but it's hard to put a specific figure to it so I didn't. \ud83e\udd20\n\nTear-down specialist Sandy Munro speculated ~20% cost of goods reduction - but this is really hard, and initially they'll have a ramp-up as well, with higher scrap rate, lower efficiency labor, higher fixed costs, etc. etc.\n\nEventually I agree that GF3 is going to print cash for their next Gigafactory, assuming the world economy avoids a crash for the next couple of years.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["crash"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5628436207771301}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Sales to China in the first half of 2019 we're around 22,000....which I think beat expectations.
