I am not sure whether to say the same for other companies that were hammered even harder like TD Ameritrade because a much greater proportion of their revenue comed from commissions, so the news impacted their company (and subsequent valuation) to a far greater degree (though others may make the same argument to instead say that their valuation was impacted to a greater degree than the effect that eliminating commissions would actually cause, making them a more attractive equity to invest in).

I'm 27 years old.  Over the course of the next few years my savings accumulation will greatly outstrip the growth of my current portfolio.  As a result I am seeking only to maximize expected value and I have no interest in minimizing risk.

With this small initial pot of money I would like to maximize volatility and expected value.  I am limited by knowledge constraints to picking a simple set of rules.  I understand that I won't beat the high frequency traders and sharks, but I have made some observations:\n\n1. In most historical periods you make more than you lose on average if you buy a single stock at random and hold it for one year. \n\n2.

Are markets today so efficient that all such information is already included in prices? Or is it the case that using such simple strategies is better than using no strategy at all (i.e. does a simple strategy win or lose compared to a completely random strategy or buying the S&P 500).  \n\n//Thanks for reading", "id": "ddf9dq", "created_utc": 1570231119.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.58, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "You\u2019re thinking too much about the wrong things.
