What has shown that they are in decline or anything of that nature? The new phones are doing very well, especially in China. Services are up and doing well also. They have like $275 billion in cash. They are going to gain a ton of money from Apple TV subscriptions which will only help the stock.\n\nThe reason for the massive drop off at the end of last year, wasn't due to anything apple did. There was a market sell off/correction and the entire market dropped massively. Tech stocks as they are more volatile dropped more than utility stocks and thats why apple and many other tech stocks had huge drops at the end of last year.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.018728628754615784}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I think you\u2019re making a big assumption with not much hard evidence to back it up.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "You could be right or you could be wrong.

Apple TV+ is starting as a perk essentially, it\u2019s a weird thing, but it really needs only one sticky show to succeed initially.\n\nThat said, I do think there\u2019s a case for betting against Apple and that\u2019s that they\u2019re a major pawn in trade negotiations. If a trade deal goes awry, they might get sanctions put on them, if it goes well, it might spike the price.

Only time I haven\u2019t been was last year during the dip and that summer when it shot up for no reason.\n\nCompetitor products that have tempted me: Galaxy Note, Galaxy Fold, Pixel, Fossil watches, Microsoft surface.

And that's just for you to break a little more than even. If you paid 860 for that contract and are up $150 I would take that. I don't think you should expect more on the arbitrage of the stock.\n\nAnother way to look at it. Right now the most you can be out is $860. However, would you sell the stock if it appreciated another 17% (the gain you have on your contract)? If you didn't have the intention of selling later then I think you bought your put for the wrong reasons. I think you're making a pretty wild bet that Apple is going to tank in the next 6 months.\n\nFollow up question is, do you won the stock already? If so what is your basis?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry mispoke when I said covered. I meant do you already own the stock, my edit didn't make it to your inbox. \n\nIt's not that you buying a put 'is dumb'. When we talk about bear vs bull we're talking time frames much longer than 6 months. Stocks go up, down, and sideways after earnings come out. Sometimes completely opposite to what people expect. But who knows, maybe a bet like yours would work out but I think that's a pretty hefty gamble on close to $1,000. Especially since it sounds like you're not very experienced with options. Trying to not be condescending here but there is a lot more to options than trying to figure out if the underlying security is going to go up or down.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.05455150455236435}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.006004860624670982}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl", "aapl"]}
