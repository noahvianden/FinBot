Options are so diverse there is a multitude of ways to trade them, and you can model multiple methods of profitability even within a single position depending on how you adjust it. With the wheel your initial research is the hardest and most demanding part (which, if you get technical, is the case with any and every trade) because once you find some steady stocks, you watch how they behave and you just sell puts. You sell the put knowing that your worst case is assignment and selling calls, which both are pretty basic and easy to plan for compared to how complicated options trading can get. The capital intensity reduces some when you get level 3 and they give you better margin holding for naked positions, and you run on the assumption that by and large, most stocks continue to rise, so you're not going to get exercised on very many positions. This is why your initial research is so important, so that you can maximize your margin requirements, while still holding enough cash on hand to cover the assignment of a % of your positions. The wheel definitely requires a larger initial balance so that you can have enough positions to effectively use your margin and not get held down to just 1 stock, while also being able to pick stocks large enough to make the premium worth it. The other perceived positive is lots of small wins which is easier on the psyche, and the ability (usually) to keep the position on after assignment and still turn it into a winner.
