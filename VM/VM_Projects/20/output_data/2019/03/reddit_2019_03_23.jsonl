{"title": "-$600 For Going Against the Market | Trading Recap #1", "selftext": "Hi, long term lurker here. A lot of money to be made today, mostly to the downside. Congrats to anyone who held puts overnight or bought puts at the open. I, unfortunately, didn't make money. I went against the trend and got burned badly.\n\nJust wanted to chip in and share what I traded today and explain what happens. I lost about $600 because I went against the trend and I kept on averaging down on my position. It was bad!\n\nMy P/L for today:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j1v6gytqorn21.png?width=545&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f631a750f76347e2a2163974dbdee28a3ccae6e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# What happened?\n\n$MA: This position was a swing. Mastercard along with the tech sector went up huge yesterday so I decided to grab a put. Turned out it was a great decision. I sold at the open today for 52%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$FB: The market sold off today as soon as the open. First 10 mins it was okay, the bulls and bears went back and forth. Quickly after the VIX started going up and the whole market started selling off. Facebook, however, wasn't follow along with the whole market. It continues to go up. So I figured, hey, this thing is strong today. Let me grab a few calls on Facebook. In my mind, I thought as soon as the market bottom this thing should go up even more. That was not the case at all. Even though $FB didn't pull back as much as the overall market in the first 2 hours or so, it slowly rolled over after that. I panic sold all my puts at the bottom. Ended up with -$466.00 in losses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qh1ie3dfprn21.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=756409cfc1fc14c64d9dc771c2c153f361d009c5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$AAPL: Same thing with Apple. Thought this was a healthy pullback and I thought I found the bottom on this stock. But then we sold off further. I lost about -$178.00 on it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The lesson\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is what happens when you go against the trend. What's worst is that I thought this was just a normal pullback where we would bounce shortly after. Not having a stop loss in mind, not respecting the levels I have drawn on my chart, and letting my emotions get in the way of my trading. With all of that combined, I ended the day with -$600.\n\nBack to the chalkboard this weekend. I would hate to see this happen to anyone even though I know this is extremely common in the market.
