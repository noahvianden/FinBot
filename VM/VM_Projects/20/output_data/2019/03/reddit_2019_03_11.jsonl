I just ask because you seem fixated on the dividend return. I feel like I should note: dividends are essentially removed from the SP after the ex-dividend date. If you're looking to grow your portfolio there's no reason to focus solely on dividend stocks. \n\nIf you're looking for a stable income source on the other hand, you can probably find the yield you want from some BDC's although you should keep in mind how the structure of these companies work.\n\nAs a side note, I think most of the companies you've listed are overpriced if you're looking for growth rather than stability (can't speak for the healthcare sector as in general I typically avoid it). An exception would be T which has a lot of debt/uncertainty surrounding it (look at their payout ratio and ask yourself if that seems sustainable with that debt load if there are any hiccups) but also has a lot of potential growth (I certainly wouldn't call this a low risk stock).\n\nAlso BA is going to tank when the market opens this week (read any news source).

They are constantly trying to produce a steady and high-volume stream of cars. There aren\u2019t big \u201cbursts\u201d and then declines in production.

Waymo's research concluded that even among employees who's continued employment was contingent on not taking focus off the road, the results was that all of them did when they thought they were not being observed.\n\nHere's my thoughts on the liability front.  Humans have a lower limbic system and mid-brain that fundamentally understands the self driving car as an automatic extension of subconscious thought.  The human brain has no other explanation for how the car could be moving itself, except that it be driving by the power of the driver through yet unexplained process.  The human treats the car as you treat your own hand.  Invisible.  \n\nEvolution over the last 1500 million years dictates that priority 1 for survival of the self (more important than even employment) is exercising this invisible power that appears to be astral projection, as the next phase of evolution.  And thus humans immediately and uncontrollably exercise this by taking eyes off the road.  It's as irrisistable as any other non-useful task I instruct you to do, like for example I tell you to stomp your foot every minute in perpetuity.  You simply don't do it, even if I pay you.\n\nMy conclusion for this is that there needs to be an active driver facing camera that runs a program that asserts the drivers hands are on the wheel, and the eyes are on the road.  And the moment the driver decides to reach into the back seat or type a text message, the car says: \"hey fucker, quit that, do it again and I won't turn back on for a week, do you understand me?\"  Short of this, our future is lots of Tesla autopilot crashes.  99.9% accuracy isn't enough, because that means a crash every week.
