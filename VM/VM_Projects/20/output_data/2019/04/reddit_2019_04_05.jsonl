Forget the time aspect for now that\u2019s pretty easy to understand. Now let\u2019s say amd drops to 20, since you have 8 dollars in intrinsic value then you can sell it for 8 dollars plus the extrinsic value of what the market thinks the implied volatility of that option is and the time component. So maybe you can sell it for 9.5. You decide to sell it, the new owner pays you 9.50 and then amd rallies to 25. Now the option only has three dollars of intrinsic value and assuming implied volatility remains the same the contract may only be worth 3 dollars and some change.\n\nOne caveat is that at some point close to the extreme ranges of delta the option won\u2019t change in price much due to changes in volatility. At 100 delta the change in option price acts more like stock, if the underlying moves a dollar your option moves a dollar. This is because at the extremes, as the delta approaches 100, it\u2019s far more likely it\u2019s going to expire in the money so the uncertainty of whether or not it will be worth something at expiration isn\u2019t much of a factor at all.\n\n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the detailed explanation!", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11458286643028259}], "tickers": ["amd"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3774239122867584}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41604185104370117}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7049562931060791}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7277966737747192}, {"body": "Let's make up an example with three stocks similar to AMD.
