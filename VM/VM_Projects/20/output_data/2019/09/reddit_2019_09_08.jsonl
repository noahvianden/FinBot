{"title": "Update: Tesla to run at Nurburgring industry pool next week, however no lap time attempts will be allowed.", "selftext": "Road & Track has updated their article after Tesla PR responded to them:\n\nhttps://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a28942079/tesla-model-s-nurburgring-lap-attempt-porsche-taycan/\n\nTesla has confirmed to be participating in the industry pool lap session next week at the vaunted Nurburgring race track. This is an event where many manufacturers can use to tune/test/develop their vehicles on the track without exclusive access.\n\nLap time recording is strictly prohibited due to safety reasons since track will be shared and very often there will be heavy traffic. Drivers are allowed to go fast under safe conditions however they are not allowed to go all out for the full lap.\n\nGiven Tesla\u2019s history (or lack thereof) with Nurburgring testing, this makes the most sense since it\u2019s probably not a good idea to take the car out to a new track (especially a difficult one like the Nurburgring) and attempt a timed lap without many test runs and trials and fine tuning. \n\nI\u2019m personally glad to see Elon/Tesla starts paying attention in this area, and this is exactly why competition is great. The Taycan is sexy but too rich for my blood, so if this results in a refreshed P100D with P3D-like driving dynamics  without too much price increase I\u2019d probably sell my Model 3 and get it.", "id": "d18g8t", "created_utc": 1567931703.0, "score": 99, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m wishing that Tesla will announce a \u201ctrack mode / package\u201d for new modelS with upgraded cooling, wheels,brakes etc in a few months and then beat the Taycan time with a \u201cproduction \u201d vehicle. \n\nCould that be technically possible?", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "As far as my knowledge goes, Model 3's battery and cooling are far better than Model S's.\n\nI say - bring Model 3 to Nurburgring, not Model S.
