{"title": "Does Tesla have a concrete plan to succeed in China?", "selftext": "I will go straight to the point: many US, or foreign relative to china, tech companies failed in China including the nearly invincible Amazon. A key for those failures is the lack of localization and familiarity with the culture. \n\nLocalization: Tesla has been pretty successful in the US despite its lackluster service. This is to a large part due to their superior product and high threshold from early adopters and enthusiasts in terms of tolerance. This may be totally different in China. To be a status symbol product, service is probably more important in China than in the US, which may be why NIO (yeah, they had a really bad quarter and still lag behind in tech) really puts an emphasis on service and customer experience. NIO's CEO has spent his whole business life in the car market, particularly to understand Chinese car buyer's desire and needs. His company stumbled in recent months and exposes their major weakness in the short-term. However, in the long run it is not obvious which will win out: service or cold, hard tech because each tech item will tend to commoditize due to competition. For example, in the self-driving car space, there are multiple Chinese startups that have been focused on solving this issue on Chinese roads, which is a totally different beast from the US's. It is not clear how much Tesla's edge is in this aspect. On the other hand, great service and customer experience may help the product to stick. \n\nCulture: Elon has been great so far. He went out with Chinese locals to have a beer and skewer. He seems to know how to respect Chinese officials and local celebrities. If Jack Ma were not Chinese, Elon would probably shred him on that 'debate' stage. But how about middle management? \n\nGoing into an foreign and totally different society to do business is not an easy task. Tesla does have the tech and quality on her side right now in China, but ignoring the potential pitfalls would be unwise given how important China is to Tesla's near future. \n\nThat's my take. Happy to hear thoughts from all.\n\nEdit: \nClearly folks here are quite optimistic. As long as Tesla is building the factory they must have a good plan. I disagree for the reason I listed above.

Third, \"the stock has to drop so people continue to buy it\" is the clear misunderstanding you have.   Markets are a Bid and an Offer, you can buy the Offer or sell the Bid.  The price in-between is called the Mid-Price.   The stock does not have to move for anyone to buy/sell it, they just have to hit the bid or offer.  The only time this will heavily impact stock price is when there is a severe lack of liquidity and the Bid and Offer separate.  The tighter the bid/ask, the better the liquidity, the better the ability to get in/out, the easier the options are to trade.\n\nYou're also touching on Liquidity.  See, with highly liquid stocks you can get in and out with massive size and do nothing to the mid-price on the stock.  Go ahead and try to move AAPL around with a single order.  It's not happening.\n\nBernie Sanders, since he was mentioned, wants to tax liquidity by use taxing trading.  That shit would dry up liquidity to the point that trying to sell 9B in a single stock WOULD collapse the price, because with a tax like that nobody would be there to try making .01 per trade a billion times. \n\nWide markets are bad for everyone except brokers.", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amzn"]}
