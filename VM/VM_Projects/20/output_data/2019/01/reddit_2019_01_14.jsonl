Neither pilot has either the time, strength or operational familiarity with the flight management system to turn off \"George\".\n\nSins all around for everyone involved:\n\nThe pilots probably didn't understand their aircraft and couldn't effectively manage its systems from the FMS.  Pilots probably had poor crew coordination and probably suffered from negative transfer in their simulator training (which probably does not cover the sensor failure they experienced) \n\nBoeing committed two massive sins:\n\n1) they built \"George\" to be stronger than either pilot and possibly stronger than both of them (probably some good old boy American style human factors chauvinism going on here, as most of the rest of the world doesn't eat beef and go to the gym three times a week) .  Further Boeing eliminated an \"in feedback loop\" mechanism for turning off the automatic flight system (pilot input at the yoke over a certain force level used to turn it off).  When an aircraft \"thinks\" it's about to stall and pushes the nose over  to gain airspreed, neither pilot is going to take the time to key through five to ten sub-menus on the FMS that it take to get to the place to turn \"George\" off.\n\n2)  having a flight control system be dependent on a single sensor  is negligent engineering.  I thought Boeing was better than this.  Frankly, it's damned scary and I would really re-think taking a Boeing aircraft it they don't do a Mea Culpa on this.  There are some very simple energy calculations Boeing could have used to verify if even single sensor data was bad (namely, if the engines are producing thrust, the air speed id dropping off, but no elevators control surfaces delection has been required to maintain altitude/deviates from attitude control forces required, then, maybe, just maybe the airspeed sensor is compromised and the pilots should be hand flying the aircraft).

And if you do a backward analysis of periods in which the 10-year US Treasury yield exceeded nominal GDP (annual % rate of change), you will probably find that it precedes an economic contraction.\n\nActually, I just charted US 10-year UST yields vs real and nominal annual % ROC for GDP and found it not very predictive. There were definitely periods where it correlated but it's weak, especially using real GDP.  The 10-year yield was > RGDP and NGDP almost all of the '80s and '90s with no economic contraction.\n\nEdit: There was the double dip recession duo of early '80s and shallow '91 recession.  I am saying during the non-recessionary periods of the '80s and '90s, the 10 yr yield was greater than NGDP and RGDP much of the time.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I just [did the same](https://imgur.com/a/mHTWtt2).\n\nI don't think the point of the article is to be an indicator, but to show whether or not it's a sustainable situation.
