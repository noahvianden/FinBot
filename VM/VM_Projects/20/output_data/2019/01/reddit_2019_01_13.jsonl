Bears wait for the stock to reach what they see as a high then sell their borrowed stock. Then there are the bulls who are the exact opposite. When the stock is neither low or high it will have less direction and fewer trades. Generally Tesla stock falls fast rises slowly. That is where we are at the moment in the middle, the stock could turn up or down. If you look at the daily chart and draw two straight lines. one from 250 in the 2nd week of October through to the dip on the 2nd of January at 300 is the bottom of the channel. The second goes from 310 in late September through 360 in early December that is the top of the channel. I predict Tesla share price bouncing around that upwards channel. If you get the timing wrong and enter at the top of the channel and exit at the bottom you probably would not realise you could have made a profit from doing the converse. I actually think that if earnings are good the stock could breakout on the upside of this channel. So up into the 400\u2019s. I am seeing a down day on the markets Monday there will be a sell off perhaps down as much as $10 for Tesla. But once Europe starts closing at 11:30 - 12:00 Eastern,  look at what happens then. Do we see a further sell off or a bounce back. Further sell off would be very bad, bounce back happy feeling, may be add to my position and say thanks for the cheap shares.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Turns out my predictions were quite accurate.
