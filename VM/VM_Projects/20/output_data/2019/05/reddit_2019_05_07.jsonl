{"title": "I created a full-blown WallStreetBets sentiment analysis site.", "selftext": "To all, I bring you all the most in-depth WallStreetBets sentiment aggregator tool that has every existed (1 out of 1, but still counts).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Firstly, to the mods:**\n\nLet me know if you are ok with this. I link EVERY single piece of data on the site back to it's respective thread on r/WallStreetBets. Also, can anyone link me to the best \"Wall Street Bets\" logo/banner. If the mods, or whoever owns the logo, allow it I will put it on the site.\n\n# About the Tool\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WallStreetBets - Sentiment:**\n\nThe tool scrapes WallStreetBets \"hot\" topics and scans for any tickers mentioned in the topic title. If a ticker or company name (ie: Amazon for $AMZN) is found, it continues to scan the comments of said topic. It then grabs the most-upvoted comments and does a \"bag of words\" neural network sentiment scan, meaning that sentence structure and word context is lost as it scans the comment word by word. Sentiment from 1 to 100 is positive (100 being most positive) and -1 to -100 is negative. Once the scan is complete it logs the current stock price of whatever ticker was mentioned and stores the score in a database (so we can go back looking at the different sentiment).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why I don't scan ALL comments from WSB?**\n\nThe reason I don't scan every topic and every comment (including daily discussion) is because there are too many comments with low scores. This means any Joe-WallStreetBets could make a comment and the program would analyze the sentiment accordingly which might potentially sway sentiment results. Instead, I've found that the most-upvoted posts are generally a consensus of the people in WSB and have given those topics/comments priority over all others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example, a post with 200 upvotes saying TSLA is going to the moon will hold more water than u/Joco saying buy TSLA puts with 3 upvotes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only problems I've encountered here is that you autists LOVE talking about the same stocks over and over and over (TSLA, DIS, AMD, LYFT, FB, etc). Although this \"bag of words\" sentiment analysis isn't always correct, I've found due to the simplicity of most comments there is approximately 70% success rate on the scans, so it's fairly accurate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Keyword/Slang Analysis:**\n\nIn the \"Keywords\" column of the sentiment section, I've also logged when any of your preferred slang terms have been mentioned in a thread (tendies, risk-free, going to the moon, btfd, going tits up, or not going tits up).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, if you click a stock ticker in the site it will show you a chart of the stock's price as well as the sentiment that has been logged in the last 3 months. All sentiment is tied to a trading day, so sentiment that has been logged on a weekend will be tied to the following Monday trading day (I found this was a better way to compare the stock price with the sentiment).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WallStreetBets - Trending Stocks:**\n\nThese lists are pretty straightforward.\n\n**Controversial Stocks**: These are the stocks where the sentiment sways often from positive to negative.\n\n**Bullish/Bearish Stocks**: These are the stocks where average sentiment is mostly in one direction (with a minimum of 2 entries).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WallStreetBets - Due Diligence:**\n\nSo, for the due diligence section I log every thread that has been posted throughout the day and every evening I read EVERY SINGLE ARTICLE. I skim the article to first see if the quality of content is decent (real DD vs shitpost DD) and then I log each individual ticker mentioned and the sentiment on it. Each DD also has a sub-category (Fundamentals/Research, Earnings/Insider (like insider buys/sells)/technicals/discussion. The stock price is logged on the date the DD was made, so it's a good reference point to see:\n\n**1**. Who's been posting good DD (good to follow a user), and\n\n**2**. If the logged DD has any value whatsoever.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Future Updates:**\n\nNot sure how you guys + the mods will see this thread as, but I have a few future updates/features I want to work on that I might implement (be able to enhance the sorting and filtering of the data to make it easier for you guys to navigate around the site, find posts by specific users, and even keep track of big YOLOs).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPost any questions or comments you might have and I'll be sure to answer. Cheers!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.swaggystocks.com/](https://www.swaggystocks.com/wallstreetbets/sentiment.php)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Changed the URL because I changed the url structure on the site.", "id": "blukl1", "created_utc": 1557255216.0, "score": 183, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "This is absolute hot garbage \ud83d\udd25\n\nThank you.", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "I just want to help everyone make tendies.
