{"title": "Is Teva too risky?", "selftext": "Teva is a large manufacturer of largely generic drugs, based in Israel.  I've been watching it for over a year, and almost bought in when Berkshire Hathoway took a stake in the company last year (sounds like they currently hold 43 million shares).\n\nThe company has been in trouble for years,  and cut their dividend in 2017 to try and help with a massive restructing of the company.  When Berkshire bought in in 2018, the stock was trading at around 18 a share, and its biggest risk was its large debt and expiring patents.   \n\nSince then, as we've all seen in the news, it's at the center of the opioid crisis and facing lawsuits from dozens of states, which tanked its share price from 20 to under 8.  \n\nIt is risky, but Orrwitz saw it as a potential value stock at 18.  If it can survive the opioid lawsuits, which should be a temporary hit, wouldn't it reason that the stock should be able to eventually reinstate their dividend,  which should help regrow its share price back to what it was last year?  It feels like what the tobacco companies went through in the 90s.  Short term pain, then back to profitability for the ones that survived.  The liability of the lawsuits is factored into it's new low price, and if/when it can get past that, and restricting, then all it really has to battle is debt, which again berkshire saw as very doable.  \n\nThere is also some small fear of the political risks with the various healthcare plans being promoted by various presidential candidates, but seeing at how difficult it was to even pass Obamacare several years ago, this doesnt feel like a substantial risk to Teva, at least not for the next several years.\n\nWith the markets being at all time highs, and everyone waiting for a recession, does teva seem like a potentially good place to park some money?

A number of months ago , Teva did *something* that majorly pissed off pharmacists and pharmacy owners in Ontario. I don't know the details, but it seems like they might have been demanding pharmacies stock a ridiculous percentage of their product before allowing direct ordering (and insert what you will about incentives and kickbacks here). The result was many pharmacies outright refusing to stock their goods, except in cases where it is unavoidable, i.e., they're the only manufacturer e.g. propranolol generic. As far as I can tell, they've done nothing so far to attempt to repair their relationship with Ontario pharmacies. Now, I'm a newbie in the stock world, so I can't pretend to have advice to give about whether to buy or not. However, Teva's behaviour in the Ontario market leads me to believe they think they're too big to fail - and no company is too big to fail. Make of it what you will. (Also, this isn't anything you couldn't find out by asking your local pharmacist, so I hope I'm not breaking any rules here!! If I am, I'll gladly delete the post!)", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Ok, so I didn't expect to ask this on this sub but I always get the Teva generic of a drug I take (Effexor).

More or less they should be pretty close in price, if not identical. Anywho, the reason you got a different brand is most likely due to a) availability of product, or b) contracts between the pharmacy and different suppliers. Re pricing: pharmacies max out what insurers are willing to pay (wouldn't you??), but may charge a different price for cash patients. If you're a nice dude, they may have put a discount onto your bill, knowing you have to pay out-of-pocket.

I was speaking from experience with affected individuals, but this obviously doesn't represent the whole picture. If your interpretation is right and Teva really has been selling below (or even *at* ) cost, then I don't really blame them for putting their foot down and giving an ultimatum to Ontario pharmacies. There really are two sides to every story! In fact, in the two years leading up to the \"Teva problem\", the Ont government had mandated an escalating series of price reductions for generics on the Ontario market. They did this by reducing what the Ontario Drug Benefit program was willing to pay. This program covers drug costs for many (but not all) medications for seniors, people on government disability, welfare, or those who are covered by the \"trillium program\". As a result, local insurers also decreased what they were willing to pay, effectively ensuring generics *had* to sell at a lower price. So, it's not at all inconceivable that Teva decided to throw a big \"f you\" to Ontario govt, especially considering that, at the time, a provincial election was just around the corner. If their position in Ontario was relatively small given their global presence, I could easily understand where they might be coming from. Also, to address their role in the opioid problem - they are the ones who pioneered the fentanyl patch return program, so it's pretty clear they're taking at least some positive steps.
