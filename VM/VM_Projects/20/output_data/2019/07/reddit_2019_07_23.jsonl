My article below:\n\nNow that earnings season has started, I wanted to revisit an article I wrote for my students at [OptionsAce.com](https://optionsace.com/)  explaining the importance of volatility in options pricing, and the  reaction of options  prices before earnings, and after the announcement.  Volatility, along  with time until an option expires, is one of the  most important  components in pricing an option.\n\nThink  of volatility in terms of insurance. If there are reports  of a  possible hurricane coming in the direction of your house, you would   likely be willing to pay extra to have as much insurance as possible in   case of mass destruction. However, once the threat of a hurricane has   passed and your house is safe, you would have no interest in having   extra insurance because of the added expense. It\u2019s a function of supply   and demand.\n\nThis is similar to how options are priced right before and after earnings.\n\nEarnings  reports are one of the great unknowns of investing. Will  company XYZ\u2019s  quarterly profits top analyst expectations? Will its  revenues come in  line? Are there any other important inputs in their  business that could  make the stock move violently in either direction?\u00a0\n\nBecause  we don\u2019t know the answers to these questions until the  earnings report  is released, options prices often rise as traders buy   volatility/insurance to hedge against big moves or the unexpected.   However, once the earnings are reported, volatility and price will drop   DRAMATICALLY. (Like after the hurricane\u2019s passed, there\u2019s no longer   uncertainty.) We know how the business is doing, and investors can more   properly measure the value of the company and the stock.\n\nHere\u2019s an options education piece I wrote on how AAPL options  performed in April 2013 at the Apple\u2019s earnings announcement:\u00a0\n\nApple  (AAPL) is due to report earnings this evening after the  close. Let\u2019s  take a look at what the options market is pricing in for  AAPL\u2019s  expected move after its earnings are released.\u00a0\n\nVolatility  is sky high! Based on the pricing of the weekly  options, those that  expire this Friday, the options market believes AAPL  will move 30  points tomorrow. I don\u2019t necessarily want to be short a  lot of options,  and I certainly don\u2019t want to be long options because of  the  inevitable volatility destruction tomorrow. (Think of the hurricane   passing.)\u00a0\n\nI am going to pick some  random strikes for us to follow to see  how they perform if we had  bought or sold them. Also, I will make note  of the current volatility  pricing on a couple of longer-dated options. I  will update these  positions in a follow-up tomorrow.\u00a0\n\nVolatility for various expiration months  \nApril 26 volatility: 100  \nMay 18 volatility: 44  \nJune 22 volatility: 35\n\n**APPL Follow-up:**\n\n**Apple (AAPL)**\u00a0reported  earnings last night after  the market close. The consensus reaction is  mild disappointment.\u00a0Right  after the numbers were released, the stock  shot up nearly 30 points  before slowly drifting down during the  company\u2019s conference call.\u00a0\n\nRight now, the stock is virtually unchanged from yesterday\u2019s closing price.\u00a0\n\nSo let\u2019s see how the options we picked yesterday performed.\u00a0\n\n**Volatility for various expiration months**  \nApril 25 volatility was 100; now it\u2019s 41, which is down 59 points on the day  \nMay 18 volatility was 44; now it\u2019s 31, which is down 13 points on the day  \nJune 22 volatility was 35; now it\u2019s 28, which is down 7 points on the day\n\n**Strikes followed**  \n*April 26 expiration:*  \n410 Calls were $12.50; now they\u2019re $3.00, a loss of $9.50  \n400 Puts were $12.50; now they\u2019re $3.00, a loss of $9.50  \n445 Calls were $2.10; now they\u2019re $0.10, a loss of $2.00  \n375 Puts were $3.80; now they\u2019re $0.20, a loss of $3.60\n\n*May 18 expiration:*  \n410 Calls were $15.50; now they\u2019re $9.00, a loss of $6.50  \n400 Puts were $17.00; now they\u2019re $11.00, a loss of $6.00\n\n470 Calls were $2.00; now they\u2019re $0.50, a loss of $1.50  \n340 Puts were $1.50; now they\u2019re $0.50, a loss of $1.00\n\n*June 22 expiration:*  \n410 Calls were $19.50; now they\u2019re $14.50, a loss of $5.00  \n400 Puts were $21.50; now they\u2019re $17.00, a loss of $4.50  \n500 Calls were $1.70; now they\u2019re $1.00, a loss of $0.70  \n300 Puts were $0.75; now they\u2019re $0.50, a loss of $0.25\n\nIn  conclusion, EVERY option we were watching was a MASSIVE loser.   Volatility in these options was destroyed after the earnings   release\u2014this is what makes buying straight calls and puts for earnings   in an elevated volatility environment difficult.\n\nTo combat this volatility destruction, I often use spreads, which  is a great way to minimize volatility and premium risk.\u00a0\n\nTo learn more visit [OptionsAce.com](https://optionsace.com/)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Doing the opposite is how I make money.

It's got some great figures and analysis in it. It's definitely worth the full read.\n\nI think this section of the article on Tesla's brand strength really sums up just how remarkable their rise has been:\n\n> Before discussing further, we would like investors to understand Tesla\u2019s automobile business from a consumer\u2019s perspective. Unlike many other household items, a car reflects the social status of its owner. Therefore, as people care about their status, **brand becomes one of the most important factors in the car buyer\u2019s decision process. Just think about how consumers typically choose their new cars. Most consumers only consider a handful of brands regardless of price-quality attractiveness of other models.** This is also one of the main reasons why you cannot find a Chinese car on the street in the U.S. or other developed countries. For this same reason, in the late 1980s, the top three Japanese auto makers had to create separate premium brands in order to attract American consumers, namely Acura, Lexus and Infiniti. Those brands, which were strategically incubated under an established auto maker, emerged about three decades ago. **Since then, Tesla has been the first new global brand to emerge.**\n\nAlso these three paragraphs really sum up just how deep the struggle of legacy automakers are against the headwinds of Tesla and BEV's:\n\n> Similarly, as consumer demand for EVs continues to rise, we expect many legacy auto makers to struggle and some laggards in this electrification trend may even go out of business. Unfortunately, for large legacy auto makers who have all been producing ICE cars, the transition to the production of the EVs is challenging given the capital-intensive nature of production, the historical allocation of talent and alliances etc. Further, the skill sets that these companies have gained over the past decades will shift from being an asset to a burden weighing down the transition. **Already, this electrification trend has caused many global auto makers to see declines in profits in the last three years.**\n\n> According to a study by Equilar, the median tenure for CEOs at S&P 500 companies was five years in 2017. **Unlike Elon Musk, the largest shareholder of Tesla, who makes decisions for long-term success, CEOs and senior executives of legacy auto makers who are hired hands are more incentivized to run the companies for short-term performance**. For example, Volkswagen\u2019s CEO announced in September 2013 that the company would become the leader in electric mobility by 2018. However, the company is still far from meeting that goal.\n\n> Furthermore, over time, as some of these legacy auto makers struggle financially, it will affect their brand image, which will have a significant negative impact on their future business. \n\nAlso, any Tesla bears should really fear this fact that's part of the analysts bull case:\n\n> Currently, **Tesla\u2019s gross margin is already nearing 20%** at only 3% to 5% of the production volume of legacy auto makers. **This compares to the average automotive industry gross margin of 12.5%, mainly from the cost advantage of producing electric vehicles**. We expect this gap to widen as Tesla\u2019s margins improve. The fact that Tesla has little need for marketing further expands the margin advantage. \n\nIt even counters the point of why it's bad when Tesla misses it's quarterly targets:\n\n> *Tesla has missed quarterly delivery targets several times, rendering statements from CEO Elon Musk and management less trustworthy.*\n\n> As long-term investors, we do not focus on quarterly results compared to expectations. Fast growing businesses must build factories, automate manufacturing, expand into new foreign markets, etc. It is reasonable for a pioneer to overestimate targets sometimes. If we look at the bigger picture, in 2018, Tesla produced and delivered almost 250,000 cars; this was more than five times the volume sold three years ago while most other auto makers barely grew for this three-year period.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "The social status thing I think is huge.
