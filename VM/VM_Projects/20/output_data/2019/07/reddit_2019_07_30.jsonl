In addition, I believe regardless of outcome, and we will get very strong dissents either direction, with no cut having stronger dissents. The dissents provided will parrot the main criticisms for cutting. This will probably lead to a neutral day, despite the cut happening.\n\nThe Fed wants to cut interest rate as an \"insurance\" to preemptively combat current economy slowdowns and world uncertainties. From what WSB said yesterday, it simply means want to increase inflation most, amongst other things. The inflation report coming out 8/13 would become another area of uncertainty if this rate cut happens tomorrow.\n\nLastly, the independence of the Fed would be under question because of the perception of \"The fed cutting when the market doesn't need a cut.\" \"Trump made him do it with his threats and assaults.\"\n\n\\------\n\nI think the final consideration here is - Will the Fed do what the market, and the president wants, instead of what it should do?\n\n**The answer probably is yes :(**\n\nWill provide a picture tomorrow when I close my position.
