I don't really understand anything of this industry.  I've looked at the big ones such as V, MA, AXP, PYPL and SQ.. I'm leaning toward V and SQ. What are your thoughts on this industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would love to hear what you would do with any or all of the positions below: \n\nMMM - Got in bad at $213. Trade war hit them hard. Can they maintain profit margin and sales in the long-term? \n\nBA - Got in at $370 - Thought it's a good play on the dip. What if this permanently damages reputation. not possible right? \n\nNVDA - Got in at 20 - they have been steadily falling since the peak of  bitcoin, which is seeing a resurgence. Without cryptocurrency I think it falls further - I think it's a sell, but maybe long long term they are good? \n\nFDX - Got in bad at  $188. More things are going to be sold online, things that need to be delivered. Amazon is taking over a lot of deliveries especially last mile. Is there a better pick or should i avoid this industry?\n\nSTNE - Got in at $33.85.. I kind of want to liquidate at a small loss to get in something similar but more established like V, MA, or AXP. Anyone know anything about this \n\nAMD - I love AMD, got in at $11.25. I know they are doing a great job of competing with NVDA and Intel recently, but their P/E is \\~100. I have a hard time justifying such a high P/E, compared to Intels P/E of 10 and NVDA of 30, however, they have such a small share of the revenue and market cap in this space. How fast can they take market share if they continue to produce quality GPUs and CPUs.\n\nAgain thanks for reading, please share any thoughts!

{"title": "Apple\u2019s buying Intel (modems)", "selftext": "https://www.iam-media.com/defensive-aggregation/intel-pulls-patent-sale\n\nA few months ago, [Apple was in talks to acquire Intel\u2019s now-defunct modem division.](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/06/apple-is-in-talks-to-buy-intels-germany-based-modem-business-report-claims/) Weeks later, Intel put their IP up for auction (presumably to speed up talks with Apple). Today, news broke that Intel has entered an exclusive agreement with a buyer on their IP portfolio - my bet\u2019s on Apple.\n\nNo way Apple can build their own modem in just six years (thanks to their deal with Qualcomm). Intel\u2019s modem division alone is >6000 people - just hiring 6000 people is going to take six years. Apple\u2019s acquisition of Intel\u2019s modem division would work perfectly for both companies. Intel\u2019s 4G/5G development is based out of San Diego/Munich and Apple\u2019s expanding their presence in both cities. The two companies have been working closely together on the past iPhones, and Intel is obligated to support both past and future iPhones. Apple knows if they don\u2019t pick up Intel\u2019s team, Intel\u2019s whole division will fall apart and support for previous (and upcoming iPhones) will falter. It\u2019s in the best interest of both companies for the deal to go through.\n\nMy bet is that news will break before Intel earnings on 7/25.
