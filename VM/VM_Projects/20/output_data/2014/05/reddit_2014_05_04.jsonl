It's important to note that this is a MINOR supdem level and that it has already been tested once already on 2013-12-05, so the chance of it bouncing off that zone AFTER breaking out of a triangle pattern is very slim.\n\nI am predicting that AAPL will push to its next supdem zone before stalling, which is 630.00. Of course as always, there will be a minor pullback after breaking any level, so smart thing to do would be to go down to H1 Or H2 timeframe to find entries.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I guess one of my only questions for you is how do you see the impending stock split effecting AAPL's performance?

If so, you are very wrong.\n\nThe number of shares will be 7 times higher, so their earnings per share will drop by a factor of 7 from ~$40 a share to ~$5.70 a share. It's dividend will also drop from ~$3.29 per share to ~$0.47 per share (remaining ~2.2% yield). As a result of the extra shares, the price will fall to exactly 1/7th of the current price as long as investors value each dollar of earnings/dividends the same. If not, you could get something for nothing just buying AAPL right before they split!\n\nThere are theories about how splits help or hurt a stock and make the price move as a result, but apple will most likely fall to ~$85\u00b1$10 and it will then be a long time before it approaches even $400 again (and if it does, it will be because of commensurate earnings that result in Apple making ~4x as much money per year as they currently do, far from a certainty considering how large they already are!)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4335695505142212}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "yes, it's called 'technical analysis'.
