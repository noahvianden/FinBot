This will tell you more about the market than anything else. I've only ever traded options and nothing else.

I assumed if you have been looking at options you'd have read about it. It's the most important thing. For any given options contracts, the open interest is publish everyday. \nFor eg. If there is a new stock AAA, it is trading at 50 and there are options available for multiples of 5. Today, I bought $55Call for May 10ct. So in today's table you will volume: 10, open interest: 0  (It is zero because these options have never traded before remember). So when tomorrow the market starts trading again, the OI will be marked as 10. Now tomorrow you come in the market and I sell you 5 of my contracts. At close tomorrow, the volume will be 5 and OI:10 (remember it's only updated daily). On wednesday when the market opens, what's the OI? It's still only 10, I have 5 and you have 5. \n\nNow remember that there are 2 sides to each trade. So whoever took the other side and sold me those 10 is still involved. He could come in the market and buy back 5ct from you. On that day volume:5, OI:10. This is the type of Oi change you're looking for. The next day, the OI will be 5. Only I have 5 ct now. You closed your interest. so OI fell. The day that OI falls means that the seller is closing interest. That is significant. Option sellers are the dominating force in the market. It's something that you have to learn by experience. Just looking at volume and Oi changes on a daily basis will give you a feel for how a stock is trading. Are people buying calls or selling calls, what about puts. etc etc\n\nJust google it. You will find much better explanations than the crappy job I did here. \n\nI have an unconventional way of trading so my risk-reward rations are kinda whack. The things is that in options you can pick whatever you feel comfortable with. It is totally upto you. \n\nThanks for the chart, I have a significant stake in AIG.
