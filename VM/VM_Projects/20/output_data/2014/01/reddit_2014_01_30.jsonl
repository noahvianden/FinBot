I can easily see it being a normal appliance in millions of US homes and changing the TV industry the same way iTunes changed the music industry.\n\nThat, plus they're still closing the gap on Microsoft's PC and laptop margin, becoming ever more popular with younger generations. They sold a **record** number of iPhones last year, as well as iPads. Honestly I don't know why there is so much hate. They beat earnings estimates! Normally that makes a stock jump up. The only reason it went down was because they only 51 million iPhones, instead of the 56 million projected. *Gasp!* The horror. Try to keep it all in perspective and think long term.
