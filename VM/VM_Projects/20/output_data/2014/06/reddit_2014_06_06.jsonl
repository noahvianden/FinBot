{"title": "Locking in profits. A bad idea?", "selftext": "So i currently have another 2 trades open (AAPL & SPY), and i'm up 100% ROI on each trade, and I'm wanting to hold it until the expiration or close to it; but i want to also lock in some profits if possible.\n\nIs this a bad idea or even possible? I'm a novice when it comes to the TWS platform, so i'm not 100% sure if this is even possible. Note that both these trades are Long Calls. \n\n---------\nI was thinking about exiting both of the trades and just reentering with half of what i put in before for each one (originally it was $1k each, so this time i would be entering with $500 each). This would only work if the IV% is at or below what i entered at originally, right? Seems counter intuitive to exit a position and reenter a position that currently has a higher IV% than it did before.

Is that method common for option traders to go below a 1:1 or 1:2 RR in long call trades? That would mean your win ratio would need to be very high for you to make money. \n\nMy idea is to have a high RR such as 1:2 or 1:3 with 1-2 month expiration. If you win, you will win 300% your investment per trade.If you lose, you lose 100% of your investment per grade. \nSo if you trend trade, there will always be retraces in the market (SPY specifically) which typical lasts 1-3 months. Now we obviously do not know when these retraces will happen, so we assume that it can happen at any moment. And every time those movements happen, you'll lose in your trade. \nSo to make up for those losses, you aim for a higher RR, in case you have a retrace where it's 3+ months and you lose 3 trades in a row, which surely happens to a lot of traders. \n\nFrom the calculations I've done, getting 300% of your investment per trade is tough, but not impossible if the market direction is bullish (obviously it is or it's a losing trade). \n\nIf the market moves to the 300%, you take profit, but if by expiration it does not, you take what's available. This is where I wanted to implement a 'breakeven' type stoploss where if the profit gets above 200% ROI, you will have a stoploss at 100% ROI and get out of the trade. \n\n\nBad idea??
