Expect the iPhone 6 to bolster AAPl significantly. iPhones are already beginning to eat away at Android market share, and that is before the intro of the larger screen sizes. Many studies show that the large screen is the key to success for Apple. \n\n2. New product categories (e.g. iWatch). This will be Apple's first new product in several years, and the first since the passing of Jobs. All signs point to it being a success, and once those sales numbers start to come in, you can be sure the stock price is going to climb significantly. \n\n3. Increased dividends, and stock buyback.

A few others I would add:\n\n**Along with the larger screen sizes, Apple have also aggressively pursued Android software feature parity**, with the introduction of the following features in iOS 8:  \n\n* QuickType keyboard that offers contextual suggestions of words when typing.\n* Third-party keyboard support, so that companies like Swiftkey can bring their swiping mechanism to text entry on iOS.\n* Interactive notifications where you could reply to messages or act on other notifications without opening the corresponding app.\n* Widgets, with actionable possibilities, like raising the bid on an Ebay item.\n* Always-on voice activation with \u201cHey, Siri.\u201d\n* Plenty of iMessage improvements that put it on par with Hangouts (or WhatsApp, Viber, etc) like media and location sharing, leaving groups, and so on.\n* iCloud Drive, a cloud storage for files that acts like Google Drive and also fixes iOS\u2019 lack of on-board file system access.\n* Inter-app communication, an Android Share-like option to send data from one app to the other without jumping through dozens of hoops.\n* An on-board, default photo editing capability.\n\nThis may be anecdotal, but I made a point of visiting /r/android after WWDC14 to gage reactions. They were, for the most part, surprisingly positive, and there were quite a few comments mentioning switching (back) to the iPhone as a result of the feature announcements.\n\n**Apple is making sure it has a finger in the pie of home automation** with the introduction of Home Kit in iOS 8. It is making sure it stays a relevant player in an area of potentially massive future growth.\n\nObviously not confirmed at all, but with Passbook, Touch ID, iBeacons and the largest collection of credit card information in the world, it looks like **Apple may be steadily laying down all the necessary groundwork for a mobile payment system**, something that may or may not tie in with their partnership with IBM. \n\nAnd finally, **Apple has slowly been rolling out their iPhone (and now iPad) trade-in program to their Retail Stores around the world since first launching it in the US late August 2013.** It's now available in Canada, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Australia. These 8 countries can be found within the top 13 largest economies in the world sorted by GDP (nominal). The only ones missing? China, Japan, Brazil, India, Russia. Worth pointing out: there are Apple Retail Stores in China, Japan, and Brazil, and there is a Apple-run iPhone trade-in program already available in India.\n\nThis trade-in program is quite interesting, and I don't believe has been fully explored yet. Here's what I see:  \nFirst of all, obvious point: **The trade-in scheme encourages people to stay loyal to iPhone.** Why switch to Android, when I can get trade-in value from my old iPhone to put toward the new one?\n\nSecond point: **Apple products have become available in more places (and countries) than ever before with each successive launch.** This is good news for market (and global) saturation, but bad news for Apple's media coverage. Customer's are thinking \"Why would I line up overnight at an Apple Store, when I can get one from my local carrier or big-box electronics store the next morning, potentially just by walking in?\" This means smaller, less impressive lines in front of Apple Stores, something the media will relish using as another sign of Apple's impending doom, when really, they are selling more on launch day than ever before.\n\nThe trade-in scheme is the antidote to that. **Suddenly, there's incentive again to buy your phone from an Apple Retail Store.** This means longer (more media-worthy) lines again, more bottom line profits for Apple (selling direct, instead of through 3rd party channels), but I think most importantly, more customers in Apple Retail Stores, many who may have never set foot in one, or only own one Apple product.\n\nGetting people through the doors of their Retail Stores is about getting people exposed to the entire Apple ecosystem and see how it all works together. The continuity and integration between iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite (and potentially the future iWatch and whatever 1st and 3rd party products Home Kit brings) is a huge drawcard for Apple. Getting people to experience this first hand will mean more Macs, iPads, iWatches and other accessories sold.
