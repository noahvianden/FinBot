You buy 100k of AAPL on margin and your biggest possible \"big loss\" is that the stock goes to zero and you owe 100k. Realistically, you'd never see any stock that established go zero without ample warning, so you'd really only lose a few or a few tens of thousands of dollars. \n\nNow... Let's say instead you buy 100k of call option contracts on AAPL that expire the 20th.  The option strike could drop to zero or close to it overnight anytime between now and the 20th. So your loss can be 100% and happen FAST - as in minutes or hours. \n\nOr... Let's say you feel really brave and sell to open 100k of put option contracts (believe it or not, this is considered a \"long\" position) on AAPL for the 20th and the strike goes 10% below what you targeted... You now are liable to purchase tens of millions of dollars of stock that are worth millions less than what you will legally have to pay. And it will all happen in the blink of an eye. \n\nLong story short, you fuck up owning a stock and you'll be sad you lost some cash... You fuck up with options and your children will be sad you declared bankruptcy and lost everything and can never trade stocks again.

(Almost all purchased options expire worthless.) \n\nAnd as a noob, buying a put is also \"ok\" - puts are purchased most often to protect against downside action. As a noob, you will most likely lose 100% of your put price. \n\nHere we get all \"mind warpy\" - selling a call is also ok as a noob. But ONLY if you own enough shares of the underlying stock and intend on selling the stock at the strike you sell. This way, when you screw up and sell a call that expires in the money, you'll be covered and your stock will be called away. You'll only lose the difference between the call price and the value of the stock. And if you were happy to sell at the strike price... Bingo, you win. \n\nSelling a put is also ok as a noob. But ONLY if you intend to buy the stock anyway at today's price. For example, let's say AAPL is 100.00 a share, but you would not mind buying it at 98.00 next Friday *no matter what happens* to the actual price (I.e it might go to 95.00 and you'd still be happy paying 98 per share.) in this case, you are effectively buying what you would have purchased anyway, but at a discount to what you were willing to pay AND with a premium paid to you for doing so.
