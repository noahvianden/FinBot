Ask  for big pay, they  have no choice, possibly they will accommodate you.  \n**The new CEO has also came up with 7% layoff each year.** If your manager  wants to get rid of you, she/he will give you a low score, bing, you  will need to go. Remember that there are no other opportunities in Boise  other than Micron.

I've worked at several other  companies prior to Micron. Every company has there good and bad, and,  mostly I think Micron is good. Micron is a very diverse company, family  oriented, with very decent benefits.  \n>  \n>Cons  \n>  \n>The  new CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, has done some good, but, unfortunately the  new system of forced bell curve ranking has changed my views of Micron.  The last couple of years Micron has done very well and this year the  bonus was probably the best I've ever seen. **Yet, the recent layoffs  using the forced bell curve ranking system have overshadowed the  happiness that one should feel with Micron's success.**  \n>  \n>I've seen   and heard of terrible stories of good people getting low scores. Some  of the scores were based on lies to help justify the low scores to  remove individuals. Some stories of managers leaving Micron because they  were being forced to give a low score when the individual didn't  deserve it.  \n>  \n>Micron has had layoffs before and usually there is  good justification for it. This last layoff, I have yet to understand  the justification for it. Financially, this is the best that Micron has  ever done. Sure, there are poor performers, they should be handled  individually and appropriately.  \n>  \n>Micron use of the forced bell  curve ranking really doesn't make sense. It uses fear to increase  performance, colleagues are now competing in the hope of keeping a high  score and the collaboration goes down. You job is in question every  year. If you do a google search for \"bell curve forced ranking\", you  will find several articles stating that this method is outdated and  doesn't increase performance and should not be used.  \n>  \n>It is for  this reason I have hard time referring and recommending Micron to  others. I really hope Micron re-evaluates this method.  \n>  \n>Advice to Management  \n>  \n>Ditch the forced bell curve ranking system.
