{"title": "Next Couple of Days", "selftext": "[deleted]", "id": "a75qbv", "created_utc": 1545092622.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "**TL;DR**: Expecting the year-end to be highly volatile but only slightly down from here.\n\nAll of the mutual funds had to make their year-end closing trades already, so that money is already out. My guess is that all of the positive bounces we're seeing are just them tactically re-entering positions now that the wash-sale window has passed; as a reminder, a lot of these funds have mandates/prospectuses that they have to stick to, so you're not going to see a global tech fund buying CVS or JNJ with the money they have on the sidelines. That's why you'll see oversold tech be the hardest green on green days.\n\nAnyone with a looser mandate and private asset managers have been selling the whole way down for tax loss harvesting into year-end. Sector rotation has been into dividend payers, and defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples (just look at the run-up MCD has had). I think people blew their wads on health care early, and now, anyone with money still on the sidelines is reconsidering getting in before year-end.\n\nOverall though the economy still isn't bad. People are just getting ahead of themselves with forecasts and spooky news stories. I think if we have any sort of \"slowdown\" or \"recession\", it'll last 1-2 quarters, and will already be priced in by the time it actually gets here. This also assumes that Powell remains sensible with hiking rates, sometime in 2019 Trump and Xi announce a trade deal (although without much in the way of actual reform, because it's purely for bragging rights anyway, see NAFTA 2.0)\n\nOn the flip side, I could be wrong. The major catalyst I can see for a prolonged slowdown/recession is the Fed using interest rates to force all of the rampant non-bank lending that's exploded in this easy monetary policy environment to quit building their balance sheets to comical sizes. Micro-loans, student loan refinancing shops, mortgage lenders (like Quicken), and many other companies will find out real fast how their business will be able to weather a rising interest rate environment, and whether or not their customers will keep borrowing or even be able to pay back that debt. Like always, S&P, Moody's, and Fitch will be late to the credit-downgrade party, and everyone will act shocked that they didn't see this coming. Write-offs and revaluation adjustments galore. The market tanks \\~20%-30% from there, and then bottoms (at which point, the true alpha-generating fund managers will have their goody bags full of juicy tickers for the next 2-3 years).\n\nIf I had to put odds on both, at this point, I'd probably put money on a 70/30 split. I have a feeling Trump is way to self-conscious about the stock market to want to go into 2020 with a big fat 0% gain on the Dow since he's been in office. He'll throw a hissy fit about his Fed chair pick, but ultimately prop up the market with a bigger concession on the China trade issues than he would have liked, and then try to rally his base about \"re-draining the swamp\" or some dumb shit like that. Xi is head gangsta for lyfe, so he doesn't have to worry about that shit.\n\n**In terms of my actual positions/plays:** It's probably taken me longer than I should have to shift from mostly long deltas to delta-neutral (and even that might be a bit too optimistic) but I've been selling premium (mostly short strangles) on hard red days, and then adjusting or closing my positions on bounces. If I get antsy, I'll sell ATM call spreads on QQQ to take away positive deltas and marginally add to my positive thetas and negative vegas. One of the nice things about post-ER tickers is that the vols stay decently high after the bad news is already mostly priced in. Fattest gains in the last couple months have come from NFLX and NVDA strangles. If this Fed meeting has some dovish comments in the minutes, I might consider adding some deltas via slightly OTM call calendars, call back-ratios, or call flys. Although I'm much more aligned with the \"wait and see\" approach on that.\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Wow, thanks for the in depth insight.
