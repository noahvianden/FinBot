Changed cost to entry from $115/disc to just ~$14. \n\nNetflix trusted their consumer till they couldn't (eg I returned it in the mail today, to trigger the next delivery, but if you lied to many times you got blacklisted on that)  They haven't been afraid to adapt, they react when they are wrong, and they have solid forward vision looking for \"the next thing.\"  BlockBuster was stagnant. They declined to buy Netflix when they could. Failed to adapt and were late to market with Boxes, and subscriptions; although the return to store for the mailer and get your next copy, was a nice idea to keep people in the store.  \n\nThat said no idea if overvalued. I see prolonged growth till they either overprice themselves, or became stagnant as well. Their influx of new shows could also be bad as they are developing anything you can toss a stick at, some shows need a second or 3rd season; many others never should have been made, but I guess that applies to network TV as well, ala the changes NBC to CBS from ABC to the King of TV. \n\nAs an aside, I'm curious if during the decline of Blockbuster, local takeout joints also suffered? I cannot count the number of ppl that came to use while waiting for their food, or ordered food while waiting for someone to return the new release that we were sold out of.

Plus as I said its less traction because not near the money or in the money yet. That\u2019ll help lock in profits and give you more than enough time for recovery and eventual profit. \n\nPlus there\u2019s more intrinsic value due to long time left on contracts, so thats another thing that can protect your gains you\u2019ve made already so far by retaining value due to time left. Thats why 400 7/20\u2019s are worth more than 400 6/22\u2019s, and why 1/19/19\u2019s will be worth more regardless. \n\nAs I said im already up 40% on the 19\u2019s so its still decent delta (basically delta is traction - once close and near the money it picks up even more speed aka gains) \n\nAnyways best of luck!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recovery"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37107598781585693}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3045996427536011}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46699270606040955}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46476173400878906}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46397173404693604}, {"body": "Holding through Thursday, bold move", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5474408864974976}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3972546458244324}, {"body": "Proving PE means absolutely nothing by itself.
