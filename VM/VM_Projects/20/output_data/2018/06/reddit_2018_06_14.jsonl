{"title": "$BAC, Bank Stress Testing, and CCAR [DD...ish]", "selftext": " I've seen the CCAR mentioned a few times now and wanted to catch everyone up on what this all means \n\n**What is it all about?:** Fed determines how well big banks are positioned to withstand a hypothetical downturn in the economy given their current balance sheet and levels of returning capital to shareholders (the more they want to return, the better their balance sheet needs to be)\n\nImportant term: CCAR (Comprehensive capital analysis and review) A test in which the fed creates a hypothetically severe downturn event and determines if the banks current/submitted plans for returning capital are allowed, i.e., can they go forward with dividend increases and share buy backs.\n\n**When:** Results will be announced by June 28th (banks had to submit documentation by April 5th).\n\n**Why it affects us:** Bank stocks have been struggling lately and are (imho cheap, especially $BAC). In 2017 no bank\u2019s plans were rejected except that Captial One had to submit a new plan that addressed Fed identified weaknesses. There was a healthy run up by most banking stocks in the days leading up to the announcement and day of. \n\nIn 2016 (no bank\u2019s plans were rejected) there was a decline before the results, and a strong run up after results were released.\n\n**$BAC Specifics:**\n\nIn 2017 after being approved for a dividend increase, the board announced a 60&#37; increase and a $12b share repurchase. \n\n$BAC closed up 2.6%; higher on 2017 before the results were announced and then added another 1.3%; AH post results.\n\n$BAC is in a great place comparing Q2 2017 (when the last CCAR happened) to Q1 2018. Cash equivalents up 50% with liabilities only up 3.97%. I have no doubt they will pass. \n\nThe increase in interest rates just yesterday saw most banks PUMPING for a brief moment before fading into the abyss.\n\nOverall, I think we should see some upside leading up to this and ***potentially*** some money shifting from tech to financials as buy backs will signal strength in the financial sector.\n\n[My positions](https://imgur.com/gallery/0YXc759)\n\nThoughts? Who's in? I'll probably sell too early anyway\n\nside note: I've decided to continue posting my imgr positions on public to farm the down-votes and oddly aggressive commentary. My last $AMAT post got this little gem \n>>>\"Wow , you made $200.
