Recently (read, \\~3 months ago) I decided to begin actually teaching myself about them to be able to do some informed decisions.\n\nNow I am getting into what indicators I should pay attention to before making decisions. And here's where I get confused. From what I can tell, P/E is a ratio of price/earnings, so it's usually a value such as x.y (e.g. 3.7), but when I went to look at the P/E history for Twitter here: [https://ycharts.com/companies/TWTR/pe\\_ratio](https://ycharts.com/companies/TWTR/pe_ratio) I see the value in the thousands:\n\n>Twitter PE Ratio (TTM):  \n**4513.00 for June 26, 2018**\n\nAm I looking at something else or what am I missing here?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Looks more like it might be a mistake on the person that computed the PE for that particular stock. FWIW every financial site does it a little bit differently. If you check the PE for TWTR or google finance, bloomberg, and barchart, you'll get 3 different numbers. Similar but different, high 80's low 90's. Frustrating. \n\nThat said, a lot of tech companies have exceptionally high PE ratios because they are constantly spending their earnings to rapidly increase their companies market share. Amazon (current PE of 270) is a great example of a company that did this rather well. It's almost as if PE ratios don't stick well to tech stocks (a financial company with a PE of 270 would probably get murdered). They are great tool for traditionally established businesses because you can see if they are shrinking or growing or under/over valued relative to their peers. ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "oh ok thank you!\n\nAnother question, is there some sort of standard for PE's and PEG's? I realize it's different based on the sector but maybe you know that a standard is 20 for everything but tech and anything higher is great and lower is bad. OR is it something you sort of learn along the way?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "http://www.macrotrends.net/2577/sp-500-pe-ratio-price-to-earnings-chart\n\nIn finance you can't speak in hard terms, everything is fuzzy. That said only recently have people gotten comfortable with a PE of higher than 20, as you can see in the chart I linked to. Here's my n00b explanation for PE, if you have a stock that is trading at 20 share and earns 1 dollar, it's got a PE of 20, that also means that it's return on your investment is about 5% per year. If that stock were trading at $10 and earning you $1, it's got a PE of 10, and is earning about 10% per year, making it a better investment. If it were 30, and earning 1, it has a PE of 30 and is earning about 3% per year. Obviously the best investment would be the lowest PE provided all things are equal. \n\nEach sector has their normal range, and you sort of learn that as you do research. \n\nBut stocks also have trends that can push the boundaries of rational decision making (outside of stocks bitcoin at the end of last year/beginning of this year is a great example of people getting caught up in irrational exuberance). \n\nThe best thing to do is to try to find a few companies that you like in a few different sectors, follow the direction of the sector, is it in favor, out of favor etc.. Follow the bigger picture too. Even if you pick a great stock with a ton of potential, if the rest of the market is taking a beating it's likely you will too. \n\nEdit: People have gotten more comfortable with higher PE ratios because traditional safer investments have lower yields so investors are chasing riskier assets to bridge that gap.
