Their pipeline is pumping out blockbuster drugs like hotcakes. They have very little debt and make a fuckton of money. So naturally it's eating shit near 5 year lows and down to $320 off it's ATH of $580. So why will it go back up?\n\nFirst of all, REGN makes a best-in-class drug for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) called Eylea. And we all know $AMD has gone up 40% in the last month, which is clearly related. They're going to be selling this shit in China soon, which means lots more squinty eyes to treat, and more revenue. I know the C-word has been scaring a lot of you lately, but this is still a big opportunity. Don't fucking wait. \n\nSecond, they just made a dope-ass eczema drug. Eczema is a shitty allergic condition where your skin is red and dry and itchy all the time. I have it, so I can confirm it sucks donkey cock. REGN just released a drug called Dupixent, which takes a steaming dump on eczema until your skin is as smooth as a baby's ass. Drug sales sucked last quarter, but they're still in ramp phase and 90% of people refill their prescriptions. Oh, by the way, this shit costs $30k/year. They just finished their clinical trials for adolescents, who make up more than 25% of eczema sufferers. Expect this fucker to ramp. \n\nThird, y'all ever hear of something called the allergic triad? It's when people with eczema also have allergies and asthma. Your body is a piece of shit that is allergic to literally everything. Remember that eczema drug we talked about? Turns out it shits on those related conditions, and it's going through clinical trials for asthma, food allergies, and nasal polyps. That means more revenue and some protection against competitors in the eczema space. \n\nStill not good enough for you? Our nigga Shkreli owns it:   https://youtu.be/X-XFxDANS6U?t=838\n\nNow a couple of bad points:\n\n- Most of their money comes from AMD, and drug competition is getting tighter. Theirs is still the best, but w/e.\n\n- Wall Street hates this stock. CEO is more interested in making drugs than placating analysts. Good or bad depending on how you see it. \n\n- $320/share is a lot for you poor autists.\n\nBuy shares or LEAPS; who knows when the run-up will happen. I'm in for about $19,000. Because the stock has dropped so much, there's not much downside risk, aside from Eylea sales eating shit next Q. Even during last week's market bed-shitting, it only dropped 1-2%.
