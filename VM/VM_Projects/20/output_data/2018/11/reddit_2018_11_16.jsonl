{"title": "[DD Inside] YOLO AAPL Calls or Put Spread", "selftext": "Alright boys, AAPL is currently trading at what it was back in July. You know what that means? YOLO season. Given that Buffet just loaded up on some more shares and that most analysts are still bullish, I think 180-190 is the floor. Yeah, *past doesn't predict future performance*, I too have read an Econ book.\n\nI've been playing with some options for the past few hours. Here are the plays I'm considering, feel free to lose money with me:\n\n**CALLS**\n\nAhh, yes, calls. The preferred degenerate gambler\u2019s roll of the dice. This first play is for those of you with long term commitment issues and questionable taste in one night stands.\n\n* BUY Nov 30th $192.50 Call (adjust position according to your preferred levels of masochism).\n\nThis one is so easy, even you can do it. AAPL gets back into 200s territory, you make money. The risk is if that doesn\u2019t happen in the next two weeks, you\u2019re fucked. If Tim has enough courage by December 1st, a share price of 200 at expiry with 30 contracts makes you about $10k less broke.\n\nIf you prefer holding options over long stock positions, this next play is for you. \n\n* BUY Jan 17th 2020 $200.00 Call (why don\u2019t you just buy shares?)\n\nAs long as AAPL makes expensive things people want, this play should work. If they at least get to their current ATH again by January of 2020, you pocket about $20k (assuming you have enough money now to buy 20 contracts). In my opinion, this an overpriced and boring play, but to each their own. \n\n**PUT SPREADS**\n\nIf you\u2019ve actually read this far, you might just be qualified enough to execute a put spread. \n\nHere\u2019s the play I\u2019m most likely going to execute tomorrow in tandem with a few calls.\n\n* BUY 100 Nov 23rd $182.50 Put\n* SELL 100 Nov 23rd $185.00 Put\n\nPer [Optionsprofitcalculator.com](http://optionsprofitcalculator.com/) (I know it doesn\u2019t account for everything, but close enough):\n\nEntry cost: $3700 (net credit)\n\nMaximum risk: $21300 at a price of $182.50 at expiry\n\nMaximum return: $3700 at a price of $193.50 on day 23rd Nov 2018\n\nBreakevens at expiry: $184.60\n\nThe thing I like about this play is you can make $3.7k as long as the stock closes at or above 186 on November 24th. Sure, you could lose $21.3k if AAPL closes at 181.50 or lower, but AAPL dropped 13 points after earnings. If you can think of an event that would make AAPL drop 9 points in the next week, go ahead and buy puts.\n\nIf you\u2019re bullish on AAPL, but calls have done you dirty lately, this next strategy is for you.\n\n* BUY 35 Nov 23rd $185.00 Put\n* SELL 35 Nov 23rd $190.00 Put\n\nEntry cost: $4830 (net credit)\n\nMaximum risk: $12670 at a price of $185 at expiry\n\nMaximum return: $4830 at a price of $190 at expiry\n\nBreakevens at expiry: $188.60\n\nAs long as AAPL finished at or above 190, you make a little under 5k (not bad for twiddling your thumbs). This one doesn\u2019t have the nice padding that the last play had, so anything south of 188 and you\u2019re losing money as usual.\n\nReally, I just wrote all this so I could feel like I had something to show for the past few hours of playing with numbers. If you found it useful/entertaining, I may do more of these in the future. The last song I listened to was Funky Duck by Vulfpeck.
