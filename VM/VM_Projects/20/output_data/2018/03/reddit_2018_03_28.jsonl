I don't know, but I can speculate.  If I were Jeff Bezos, I would keep prices as low as possible until businesses and customers were automatically shopping at Amazon first by default.  (Which they are starting to do already - I was in the pilot program of Amazon for Business when it first got rolled out and it was *amazing* how quickly they adapted their website based on business feedback.)  So, once Amazon has a solid lock on entire industries (not to mention lower prices through economy of scale) he jacks up prices on everything by a couple of cents and suddenly that's an extra several billion.  Of course, he would do that at the optimal time, probably several months before he wants to sell some of his stock.  That way revenue soars, prices go up, and he gets a much better value personally.  It's just the smart thing to do from a selfish perspective.\n\nBut even leaving out the fact that Amazon can easily increase their profits by a huge amount anytime they want - and the only reason they are holding back is that they're playing the long game to secure additional customers - they already have three new markets that can easily become multibillion dollar industries.  Healthcare is one.  With those regulatory hurdles of medicine cleared, it'll be much easier for Amazon to to get into the drug trade and secure dispensary licenses once the Fed legalizes pot (which we all know is happening eventually - the majority of Americans support it).  Ever do the math on how much money Silk Road made?  And their process was stupidly inefficient.  So drug sales are number two.  I'm no expert there, but would you like to hazard a guess on what the profit margins for that are?  I'm guessing that they're high.\n\nFinally, there's the large scale business side.  All those multimillion business deals that used to be done with VARs or distributors due to economy of scale?  Guess what - Amazon can do them too now.  If you want to buy, say, several hundred thousand screws, you don't have to accept whatever Amazon's market price is - you can reach out to your Amazon for Business sales rep and they will negotiate directly with their vendors to get you an even lower price based on that.  When I was working at a consulting firm, clients used to pay big bucks for us to do that.  Now, Amazon does it for free.\n\nI'm not giving you inside information here.  I was in the pilot program, but Amazon for Business is open to the world now so this is all common knowledge, if you care to do some research.  It's just that unless you're in logistics or strategic sourcing at a very large company, you won't ever hear about it because why would an Amazon sales rep approach you about their large scale volume deals?  It's not like some random dude on this sub is going to ever decide they need ten thousand corrugated cardboard boxes, for instance.  So most investors go about their day completely unaware that Amazon has *already* opened up a huge new market that they don't even know about.\n\nSo yeah, I've thought this through pretty well.  I've probably got more knowledge about Amazon than anybody on this sub.  I don't want to dox myself, but if you use Amazon for Business, part of the way the approval workflow is designed is based on feedback I gave them.  So I'm pretty confident in my analysis here.  I'm not basing this on just my own \"gut feeling\" - I've done the math and it works out.  Market cap only matters when you have significant price competition.  If you are charging $5 and your competitor is charging $5.50, then you are limited in how much you can raise prices.  But if you are charging $5 and the competition is charging $7, then your market cap is purely artificial.  You can raise or lower it at will as long as you're still underbidding the competition.\n\nAnyway, I hope that explains my reasoning well enough for all the naysayers.  If not, well - too bad.
