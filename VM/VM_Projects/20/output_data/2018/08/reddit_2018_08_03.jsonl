{"title": "Questions I'd be Asking If I Owned Tesla Stock", "selftext": "# Questions I'd be Asking If I Owned Tesla Stock\n\n**Here\u2019s a big question I\u2019d be asking if I owned Tesla stock: What happened to 345,000 reservations?**\n\nWhen Tesla\u2019s Model 3 was released, it was supposed to be a $35,000 car. Four hundred thousand people,\u00a0including yours truly, put down a $1,000 deposit to reserve their spots in line so they could get their hands on that marvel as soon as it became available. It was a brilliant move by Tesla, as it provided the company $400 million of interest-free financing \u2014 the biggest crowdfunding project ever.\n\nToday, after some delays, the Model 3 is being produced. However, $35,000 seems to have been a fiction of CEO Elon Musk\u2019s imagination. Though the car is getting great reviews\u00a0from auto critics, the price for a bare-bones Model 3 starts at $49,000, and the tax incentives are fading away.\n\nBut something interesting happened recently. I received an email from Tesla that said: Model 3 is available to order, and no reservation is required in the U.S. We\u2019re now offering all our best options \u2014 including our Long Range and Performance configurations with dual motor all-wheel drive. You can design and order yours today for delivery in approximately 2\u20134 months.\n\nOn the surface this sounds like great news, except that it begs a question: What happened to 345,000 orders? Let me explain. According to Bloomberg, which has been tracking Tesla\u2019s production, to date (as of July 28, 2018) Tesla has produced 55,000 Model 3 cars. Since a $1,000 deposit was supposed to secure buyers a place in line, any car ordered today will only be delivered after orders that were placed years ago are fulfilled \u2014 after all, 400,000 people paid Tesla $1,000 to hold their places.\n\nThus there are only three possible explanations for the email I received. One is that Model 3 production is expected to accelerate at an exponential rate to 40,000 cars a week, starting now. However, Bloomberg estimates that Tesla\u2019s normal production cadence of the Model 3 is closer to 2,825 cars a week, so this is a highly unlikely scenario.\n\nOr two, maybe Tesla has been extremely liberal with its statement of a two-to-four month delivery schedule because it still has 345,000 cars to produce before it can start fulfilling new orders, and the company is using that email to raise additional funds from new customers making deposits. (The required deposit is now $2,500.)\n\nThere is a third explanation: The bulk of the original 400,000 orders were for a $35,000 car. When it came time to actually buy the car, consumers may have realized that the out-of-pocket expense was much more than expected and simply [canceled](https://contrarianedge.com/2018/04/06/why-this-tesla-car-shopper-sped-away-from-the-model-3/)their orders, draining Tesla\u2019s balance sheet of $345 million.\n\n**This brings us to the next question: How sound is Tesla\u2019s balance sheet?**\n\nWhat Musk has achieved with Tesla and SpaceX is truly astounding. I have incredible respect for him, but he is also a magician playing a confidence game. If Musk can continue to convince the market that Tesla has a bright future, then the market will continue to finance Tesla\u2019s losses, and maybe Musk will figure out how to produce the Model 3 more cheaply and then Tesla will sell hundreds of thousands of Model 3s and the future will be as bright as Musk paints it.\n\ncontinue reading...\n\n[https://contrarianedge.com/2018/07/31/questions-id-be-asking-if-i-owned-tesla-stock/](https://contrarianedge.com/2018/07/31/questions-id-be-asking-if-i-owned-tesla-stock/)", "id": "946zdi", "created_utc": 1533274984.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Didn\u2019t Elon Musk say that the $35k entry price  would only be achievable once the Giga factory opened.
