Gold fell to its lowest price since January 2017 on Wednesday amid dollar strength, while industrial metals had their biggest one-day tumble in nearly seven years as negative sentiment in China and Turkey fueled a global risk-off.\n\n\u201cIt was very unique to have both shorts at these levels, and obviously profitable,\u201d said Mark Connors, head of risk advisory at the Swiss bank.\n\nHedge funds and other large speculators held a record 63,282 net contracts shorting gold futures and options, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.\n\nBase metals pared some losses Thursday, a bounce attributed to signs of thawing trade tensions. Cooper futures gained as much as 3.2 percent after their worst one-day sell-off in over three years.\n\nYet the recovery could prove a head-fake, if it\u2019s been exacerbated by smart-money traders taking profit from shorts that would have paid off handsomely amid the carnage.\n\n\u201cThis certainly can be a short-lived tactical move by funds in base metals,\" said Connors.", "id": "97u6i5", "created_utc": 1534439650.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "Bet against the most sophisticated investors with the most skill, best resources, and a team that watches the price every second markets are open combined with algorithms we don\u2019t have access to?

{"title": "Understanding Micron's Decline (It's Bullish)", "selftext": "Like most people here, I share your pain in seeing the decline of our beloved Micron Technology (MU). At its current valuation, it is trading at a PE of 4.80 and a forward-PE of 4.06. It's price/book is now under 2, and its price/FCF is 5.19. We all know how undervalued the company is, but that's not what I want to drill home today. I want to drill home the volatility of the stock and its buyback, which hopefully will start as close to 9/25 as possible.\n\n**Let's Start With Volatility:**\n\nFor your viewing pleasure, I went ahead and attached a chart of Micron since November of last year. In less than a year, Micron has had many 6 drops of 15% or more. The point I am trying to make is that while this current drop is killing us all, it is in Micron's nature to do such a thing. Micron doesn't trade like Apple (slowly up 0.3% daily and climbs). It is a volatile stock that runs 15% in a week, and then drops 2% per day afterwards. If you're playing this stock, you have to be ok with this level of volatility.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/lbpY4JU](https://imgur.com/a/lbpY4JU)\n\n**The Buybacks and EPS:**\n\nLet's assume that each share is being bought back for $49.50 each (in reality it could be more or less, but that's what we are using for this example).\n\n$10,000,000,000 / $49.50 = 202,020,202. They can repurchase roughly 200mm shares.\n\nThey current have 1,159,765,000 shares outstanding.\n\n1,159,765,000 / 202,020,202 = 5.74. This mean Micron can get approximately 20% of the company off the market.\n\nAnalysts are talking about \"storm clouds\" and reduction in DRAM prices, which would lead to less revenue.
