It was cheap enough for YOLOs regardless of outcome.\n\nIn my mind, it was a sink or swim situation at their sub-$9 stock price and < $200 MIL market cap. Either this ER would make them float, or they would sink.\n\nWell, neither happened, and they were acquired.\n\nEDIT: To put things simply, if you have over 200 restaurants and under $1M market value per restaurant, you'd probably be better off selling all of your restaurants and going private or getting acquired at that point.

Does it just come with experience?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Experience, learning about option Greeks, how to at least glance at an earnings report and earnings results, lots of googling to get legitimate analyst opinions and concerns, press releases, etc...\n\nAvoid chartists. There's a lot of them. Lots of people saying, \"The charts supports this hypothesis...\" in their articles.\n\nNo, they don't. If you see an article that tries to use a chart as its primary thesis, find another one, but do take note of candlesticks and where resistance on low / high pricing typically is.\n\nFor example, AMD had trouble exiting the ranges between $10 - $13 for a long time. I made money by investing in AMD when the price was closer to $10 and selling when the price exceeded $13. That lasted until this past quarter, when they finally started selling things and broke past $17. This wasn't based so much on fundamental company values, but my understanding of that particular cycle.\n\nCharts reflect overall investor sentiment on a stock at any given point in time. For everything else, you have to dig in and find out what drove that sentiment and investor decisions.\n\nThere are different strategies. Come up with a solid strategy that's as rigorous as you're comfortable with and stick with it. If you get into a position and are considering changing your strategy mid-way, assume you made a mistake and figure out how to anticipate that in the future. I have opened then closed or rolled over positions many times when things don't go as I'd hoped - but that failure condition was something I had factored into my initial purchase.\n\nEarnings reports and press releases will tell you how a company has actually been doing since the last report, and this is when you'll see sudden jumps or skips. Press releases and news reports also cause a lot of speculation. Try to understand whether or not public sentiment is rational. There's a famous saying about how the market can remain irrational longer then you can remain solvent. This is true, but a relatively rare phenomenon. I made a lot of money off of FB and COST when their stock prices went down irrationally just because of bad and inconsequential press releases. MTCH saw similar behaviors after FB announced its dating service.\n\nIt helps to not be so focused on the numbers (even though they are useful) and use as much first principles type thinking as possible. Is this fundamentally a sound business? What is the market sentiment like? What are investors concerned about?\n\nIf the fundamentals haven't changed, but the stock price has, investigate!\n\nThere are a few fundamental ways to think about investing. One is investing in the company itself and its value (long positions). Another is trying to anticipate how other investors and the overall market feel about something. Then there's variations of this - betting against companies (short positions), betting for volatility, betting against volatility, etc.\n\nI'm best at the consumer (especially technology consumer) space because it's driven so much by consumer preferences. It makes up for mismanagement of companies quite a bit, and economies of scale mean a successful consumer product can often overcome financial and management challenges. I'm not so good at other spaces. Some people are. Figure out what you can acquire enough confidence in to make sound decisions against. If you can't make reasonably sound decisions, then you're gambling, not investing.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for this.

I think why you sometimes get summarized information is because a lot of people just combine fundamentals with particular case studies or areas they feel confident in. An investment thesis can be based on in depth financial analytics you practically need a degree for, or just gut feeling and a sense of what should be rational for a given market. Take for ex: The Intelligent Investor vs Security Analysis, two seminal books on investing. The former is more for the layperson, the latter is also a great book, but to some folks it's just 1000 pages of gibberish.\n\nI don't have much to say here, sorry. I don't consider myself a good analyst.\n\nI just consider myself confident when it comes to certain things, and I build that confidence by reading more about a particular stock, market, and industry. FB was a great example of this.\n\nThey were down to 150 even though they were arguably one of of the strongest companies on the planet, and their demise was in my opinion being significantly exaggerated. Same with COST after AMZN announced its purchase of Whole Foods. There was no fundamental reason I could find for FB or COST's stock prices to go down, so I took the chance that the stocks would *bounce back* at the very least, and they did.\n\nThese videos taught me general options pricing basics:\n\nThis one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCJcEOYuuII\n\nAnd this one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXZIW161ryI\n\nWhen I can approximately eyeball that a 10 - 15% gain in a stock is typical after good results, and that could be between 20 - 30 points, and that each point is *roughly* $100 gained in option value (you subtract premium, but good results also increase volatility and stuff tends to roughly balance out), the analysis doesn't have to be so involved.\n\nI personally *never* invest in an opportunity that requires me to do advanced math and compute razor thin margins. If an opportunity isn't obvious enough that I can predict profit from what I can eyeball alone, I tend to stay away from it.\n\nIf you don't have enough confidence to at least eyeball an opportunity, read stuff like Investopedia more.
