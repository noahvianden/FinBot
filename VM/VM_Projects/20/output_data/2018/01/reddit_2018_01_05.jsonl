{"title": "NTDOY Earnings/Run-up", "selftext": "An extremely strong buy signal for me.  I'm looking for discussion/thoughts on this though.\n\nWhy a strong buy:\n\n1. Record Switch sales.  Switch is the fastest-selling console in the US and Japan.  I do not have news regarding elsewhere, but I wouldn't be surprised if the Switch is dominating Europe, Australia, and the rest of Asia as well.\n\n2. Nintendo is about to implement a fee for online use - which most Switch users will pay.\n\n3. Nintendo stock dropped ~15% following the less than spectacular release of Animal Crossing mobile.  I believe this is an overreaction.\n\n4. Amazon's best seller list has the Switch, Switch games, and Switch products occupying many of the highest sold products in the video games category.\n\n5. Nintendo has earnings at the end of the month.  It is also currently deflated a bit due to the Animal Crossing situation.  I believe, regardless of how it performs in earnings, that it will have a very large run-up to at least the level it was one month prior (~$57, now it is at $47).  Furthermore, I also believe Nintendo will at least meet, and likely beat analysts EPS.  More on this below.\n\n\nOn the downside:\n\n1. Analysts forecast an EPS of 0.44.  This is very high compared to prior EPS', and I have not created a model, nor seen the models of the analysts that they use to justify this amount.  From a gut-feeling I believe that Nintendo will at least meet this, and in its earnings report forecast huge growth potential.
