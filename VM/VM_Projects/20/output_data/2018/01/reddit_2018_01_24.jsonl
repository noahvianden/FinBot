{"title": "Good time to get into AMZN", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI know this is a bit of a redundant question in many ways, as there are so many elements involved and also no one knows the answer. However, I would like to get a view of all your individual opinions.\n\nI've always wanted AMZN and GOOG stocks while in University (2-3 years ago) but couldn't afford them. I made my first entry into the stock market this December with BAC, JP Morgan & Citi Group shares. They're all doing pretty well. BAC is on 7-8% growth at the moment.\n\nI also want Amazon shares, but I feel like I may be purchasing at a weak time because I'm not buying at a dip (albeit a minor/temporary one). I should have bit the bullet in December but made a mistake. I wonder if there will be some sort of price correction in the near future or dip that I can capitalise on. I'm struggling to make the necessary logical deductions on this particular piece.\n\nWould be helpful to know your thoughts/opinions on this so I can flesh out my perspective on this particular question.\n\nThanks,\n5DYL7", "id": "7sm2sw", "created_utc": 1516787925.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "There's no way to know.

I didn't do any numbers analysis or all, but I'm seeing this as a logical thought process once you take the time to think about it.\n\nBasically, United announced that they will be increasing their offer mostly for domestic flights. What I find interesting in SKYW (SkyWest) is that they fly for Delta, United, American Airlines and Alaska Airlines, but not under the name SkyWest (which is why you may have not heard about them). In fact, they are the largest regional airline in North America. Their flights mostly consist of flying from small/mid airports to the large hubs of each of the big companies. To me, this is interesting because it positions them well with regards to 2 elements I've been reading a lot on today, following United's ER. \n\n1. United wants to increase its domestic offer and knows this is a key battleground : SkyWest operates their regional legs and thus, would benefit.\n\n2. Experts are afraid that increased capacity will lower fares and lead to a price wars. While that is indeed possible, I feel like SkyWest would be, to a certain extent, immune to a price wars since it actually contracts with four of the five major players for domestic travel in the US (exception being Southwest). \n\t\nNow, this is by no means DD or an expert's point of view, but this was enough to convince me to pick SKYW over any other Airline when I bought shares today.\n\nApparently, I am not the only one to have this opinion on the matter : https://imgur.com/a/dzQ8D\n\nThoughts?\n", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Take a few bucks of profit and sell.

They, of course, operate WeChat, QQZone and QQ - combined these have MAU of 980 million. Within each of these, they have finance solutions, the biggest being WeChat Pay - part of which is contributing to the 143% Year on Year revenue growth for their other business department (featuring their payment business and Cloud business). \n\nDid you say you like The Cloud? Don't tell me that you like AI technology, too? \n\nTencent owns two AI startup labs.

Ma Huateng - or, as I like to call him, the one true Ma - has silently, steadily and overwhelmingly built up an empire of investments upon layers upon layers of IP with access to one of the biggest user base in the world. \n\nMy last comment is food for thought, and to me, it summarises the entire philosophy of Tencent. You may know that WeChat is a social media platform, I haven't fully fleshed out how you can walk into a store, and (through WeChat) the automated payment technology can [register](http://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2130062/tencent-beats-amazon-launch-unmanned-shop-lags-other-chinese-tech) what you pick up and charge it straight to your phone without you needing to talk to anyone or scan anything.
