Those 18 contracts give you the option to buy 1800 shares of AMD for 10.50 a share. Assuming you\u2019re talking about American options (there\u2019s a few different types, American is the best) then you can buy those shares for that price at any point between now and April 13th. \n\nYour max loss when you\u2019re buying call options is what you pay for the contracts, that\u2019s usually known as the premium. So if you\u2019re buying these options for 9.78  each than you can do the multiplying. This is different for writing calls/ buying or selling puts. \n\nYour profit is going to be the difference between your strike and the price of the stock (strike is 10.50 here)\n\nThe comparison between purchasing the underlying (the stock) vs purchasing the option is that you can make more money on the options if the price has a decent rise (it needs to be traded higher than what you paid for the contracts) and the loss has a floor with the contracts but doesn\u2019t with the underlying ( you can lose more money with the stock than with the options) it\u2019s basically exponentiated because every option is worth 100 shares.\n\nThe last thing you said is arbitrary. There\u2019s no real way to put a dollar amount on how much you should spend on options. When it comes to options you should first recognize your goal. Options trading is complex and involves a lot of things like momentum, Greeks (the changes in the options vs changes in the market), trader consensus (do people think these things are over or under valued) and a bunch of other bullshit. On the other hand, if you\u2019re using options as a form of hedging then all you want to do is maximize your upside and meanwhile reduce your downside risk. A quick google search on options strategies will give you all the info you need on that end (or just dm me).\n\nAnyway this isn\u2019t explained for a 5 year old so if anyone wants me to break this down more for them just let me know.
