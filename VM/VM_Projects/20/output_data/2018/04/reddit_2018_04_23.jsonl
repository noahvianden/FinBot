They\u2019re not a good company in the moral sense at all. However, I\u2019m not arguing for them on this end either. Instead I\u2019m questioning whether it\u2019s a reasonable move to invest in them while they\u2019re down and recovering from a major scandal. They\u2019re thousands of companies out there and it\u2019s tough finding ones that don\u2019t break rules, harm the environment, take advantage of others, produce harmful products, etc. while also making a profit. I\u2019ll be honest here, unless the company is doing something extremely evil or bad, I\u2019m probably still going to invest in them if they\u2019re a good company, have potential, or if the right opportunity arises. Whether that makes me a shitty person is for another discussion but I\u2019m interested in discussing the investing side of things at the moment.\n\nIn regards to comparing them with JPM and using PE there is more to it than just that. PE isn\u2019t typically the best marker with banks because their PE is traditionally on the low end regardless so you\u2019re not going to get vast differences like you would for something in the tech sector for example. The differences are going to be much smaller because you\u2019re working with closer and smaller PE figures.\n\nI\u2019ll include this statement here below courtesy of the Motley Fool:\n\n> Perhaps the simplest way to compare Wells and JPMorgan in terms of valuation is by using price-to-earnings ratios. When you look at trailing earnings over the past 12 months, JPMorgan looks substantially more expensive than Wells Fargo, as the Manhattan-based bank trades at a trailing multiple of 18 compared to Wells' 13. However, the gap narrows considerably when you take into account near-term future expectations, with the San Francisco-based bank's forward multiple of 11 being only a little less expensive than JPMorgan's figure of 12 times forward earnings estimates. Banks often use price-to-book as a way of measuring valuation, and there, too, Wells Fargo looks slightly cheaper. But at roughly 1.5 times book versus 1.7 for JPMorgan, Wells' advantage is fairly small. Overall, Wells has a slightly more attractive valuation than JPMorgan at current levels.\n\n\nAs you can see, WF does trade cheaper than JPM. As mentioned in the article, the gap decreases when looking at forward earnings and expectations but I believe this will change in favor of WF once they get past this scandal blow-over. This scandal was messy and expensive and WF is paying for it now but the fact that they still manage to beat JPM on this end during these turbulent times is fairly impressive. This is also taking into consideration that banks often operate on the lower side of PE figures and because we\u2019re comparing two banking giants here the difference between them can\u2019t be expected to be that big.\n\n\nJPM and WF also cover different aspects of the financial sector as well with JPM focusing much on investing and portfolio management while WF\u2019s bread and butter is mortgage lending. I think the banking (and healthcare) sectors are in for bright futures and banking is considered by many to be a undervalued sector at the moment so diversifying within the sector isn\u2019t necessarily a bad idea. WF also offers a higher dividend that has continued to grow over the years. Even if dividends aren\u2019t your thing or a concern of yours, WF also appears to get more bang for their buck when looking at their return on asset (ROA) number when compared against JPM.\n\nJPM is a great company and one that I\u2019m happy to have in my portfolio. I think they\u2019re a much better company than Wells Fargo. However, the reason WF is on my radar is that I think it has more potential for higher rewards than JPM. If this money wasn\u2019t part of my risky plays fund, I\u2019d go with JPM any day of the week but because this is money that I put aside every quarter to invest in relatively moderate to high risk companies or sectors, I\u2019m taking Wells Fargo.
