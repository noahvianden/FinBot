{"title": "A Day in the Life of a Stock Trader - Blog | Horizon Institute", "selftext": "Section 1 \u2013 What does a stock trader actually do\n\nThe life of a trader is often glamorised by films such as The Wolf of Wallstreet and Margin Call \u2013 a view that is shared by many who have no direct experience with the wider investment industry. It is also true that different types of traders have very different workloads. Trading emerging markets is not the same as trading FTSE stocks or the forex markets.\n\nLet\u2019s start by defining what traders, broadly speaking actually are:\n\n\u201cProfessionals in finance who buy and/or sell assets on the financial markets.\u201d\n\nA day in the life of a trader: Behind the scenes\n\nThese are people who usually have a background in finance, either through traditional education \\(think degrees in finance, accounting, economics, investment management etc\\) or through practical experience at companies working within financial services.\n\nThis is to say that the day\\-to\\-day activities of a trader is to either buy assets \\(such as stocks, futures, commodities\\) or to sell assets \\(such as stocks, forex, bonds\\). Two distinct roles in trading can be summed up in the Buy side, and the Sell side in terms of execution.\n\nA broader categorisation would include participants within the financial markets who trade securities. This encompasses independent traders working from home to large multinational financial institutions which see billions of dollars a day flow from and to their order books.\n\nThe Buy Side\n\nThe Buy side is concerned with purchasing assets, and this generally involves taking orders from management or clients and then sending those orders to the broker to be executed. This role is being gradually replaced by technology, specifically automation and AI, and its hard to see a future for buy side traders 20 years from now. There is also a distinctly bad reputation associated with buy side traders, these are often just messengers, and have been known to treat brokers with incredible hostility and bitterness over recent years.\n\nThe Sell Side\n\nAlternatively, the Sell side is just the opposite \u2013 these traders are only concerned with selling positions either the firm or the firms clients holds. Again technology is eliminating this role over time, and today both buy and sell side traders simply take message, and pass it along either electronically through an online platform or via telephone for the perhaps more traditional establishments.\n\nPrivate Hedge fund managers\n\nMany successful traders have gone on to start hedge funds with private companies and from private investors. This is a highly privileged position to be in, as hedge fund managers are in control of both the broad strategy for the investments and receives the greatest compensation should the strategy be profitable.\n\nPrivate Portfolio Managers\n\nPortfolio managers working at a private company \\(such as a large hedge fund\\) is again a much sought after position. Portfolio managers generally create a positive or negative selection portfolio, which allows them to implement their own strategy to make the best returns with the lease risk \u2013 although these parameters are often set outside the control of the individual portfolio manager. The same also exists within commercial banking, but it is usually more focused on creating a very balanced portfolio that exists to hedge risk as opposed to making real returns.\n\nAnalysts\n\nAnalysts do the number crunching and quantitative prep work for the portfolio or hedge fund managers. This role involves applied finance and taking a close look at various assets fundamentals. This includes the balance sheet, income statement and cashflow statement for analysts looking at stocks. This is usually a relatively junior role, and those who are successful here tend to become traders, portfolio managers and eventually hedge fund managers over the course of a successful career.\n\nInvestment Banking\n\nThere are still plenty of traders left at investment banks, despite the decline over the last few decades. As much as 90&#37; of the time is spent dealing with clients such as Hedge and Pension Funds.\n\nInvestment Bank Traders\n\nAs much as 90&#37; of the time is spent dealing with clients such as Hedge and Pension Funds. \n\nThe trader is then Making Markets in Assets the clients want to buy/sell, such as stocks, currencies, commodities and bonds.\n\nThe other 10&#37; of time is Proprietary trading, utilising the banks large balance sheet to create a positive selection portfolio.\n\nMarket Makers \\(Agency\\)\n\nMarket making is the primary task of an investment trader \\(\\~80&#37; of market making business\\) \n\nSplit into two sections:\n\nAgency Business \u2013 Client holds risk\n\nRisk business \u2013 Investment Bank holds risk\n\nInvestment Bank charges commission on these activities at a typical rate of 5 basis points or 0.05&#37;\n\nExample \u2013 Buy \u00a310,000,000 of BP stock at \u00a3100 per share = 100,000 BP shares.\n\nCommission for bank \\- \u00a310,000,000 X 0.005 = \u00a35,000\n\nRisk free for bank \u2013 algorithm executes trades based on client orders\n\nIn terms of basis points, 100 = 1&#37;\n\nProprietary Trading\n\nThis type of trading can happen in two ways, the first where small investors at home use their own capital to trade for a direct gain or commercially where a firm uses its own capital to make trades to be the prime beneficially of the rewards should the trade go well. This is in contrast to how hedge funds would normally just earn a commission, by also utilising internal capital the firm is able to take larger risks, which tend to come with the larger rewards.\n\nHere\u2019s another interesting fact:\n\n\u201cOnly 6&#37; of candidates end up making it as a professional trader\u201d \\(Business Insider, 2011\\)\n\nThis statement alone shows just how competitive the industry is, and to make a successful career is even harder, with only \\~5&#37; of traders ever making it to a managerial level.\n\nA day in the life of a trader: Behind the scenes\n\nSection 2 \u2013 How does 8 hours day break down?\n\n6:00 AM\n\nTraders usually start the day at 6.30 AM and start to catch up on news that broke overnight that may A\\) affect current positions or B\\) provide opportunities for new positions. These changes are digested, and areas of special interest are noted for further analysis later. \n\n7:00 AM\n\nArrive at trading floor at 7:30, 30 minutes before markets open. This is the time where traders prepare themselves for the day. It also serves as an opportunity to talk to colleagues. For most hedge funds and other long\\-term traders, team meetings will happen in the morning to ensure all traders are up to speed and playing from the same game plan. \n\n8:00 AM\n\nMarkets open: based on overnight news there may be buying / selling activity to adjust the traders portfolio based on the latest information. Many traders prefer not to trade at the market open due to higher volatility as traders from around the world react to overnight news. \n\n9:00 AM\n\nA common task around 9:00 AM would be to scan the market for short term opportunities, or to catch up on fundamental company analysis of companies in the watch list. \n\n10:00 AM\n\nContinuation of analysis or opportunity seeking based on the traders own intuition, experience and judgement. This is also prime time for internal meetings with the team and meetings with clients, potential clients etc. \n\n11:00 AM\n\nHere we see lower volume and volatility, and so short\\-term opportunities diminish, traders are thinking about lunch at this point. Finishing up financial models and analysis done in the morning. Another prime time for meetings with the team and clients. \n\n12:00 PM\n\nMost long\\-term traders take lunch, some short\\-term traders will stay at the desk as timing can be critical to a successful day. \n\n1:00 PM\n\nAs investment banks and other major institutions return from lunch volatility in the markets increases and short\\-term traders get back to work. Long\\-term traders generally get back to analysis, risk management or strategy functions with only a cursory interest in the current market prices and volatility. \n\n2:00 PM\n\nDay traders will spend this time monitoring positions and executing trades as necessary. Long\\-term traders use this period in a variety of ways, as mentioned above. \n\n3:00 PM\n\nShort\\-term traders now think about closing existing positions and stop looking for new opportunities. This is also where the administrative functions of cancelling unfilled orders, or for long term traders, finalising analysis of the day and presenting it to stakeholders. This is the last chance to exit positions for the trading day. \n\n4:00 PM\n\nThe markets are now closed. Traders often look back at the day, seeing what went well \\(and what didn\u2019t\\). Management will often check in and with\\-it bureaucracy and paperwork. \n\n5:00 PM\n\nTime to leave the office and go home. The advent of mobile internet means most traders are now reading the latest financial news, following commentary and thinking about the strategy for tomorrow. \n\n6:00 PM\n\nIf all went well arrive home, if not then its likely the trader will still be at the office working to meet the deadline of the day, from financial models to briefing management and clients. \n\n7:00 PM\n\nOutside of the general workday, traders will spend much of the evening doing research and analysis \u2013 everything from learning about the markets to experimenting with financial models to taking an advanced excel course. \n\nSection 3 \u2013 Why you might want to be a stock trader\n\nWe meet a lot of traders, its what we do \u2013 and here are a few of the top reasons traders we spoke to continue to do what they do.\n\nLove the Game \n\nMany traders are extremely fond of the game that is the financial markets. Day traders talk about the rush as fast\\-paced action that runs from 8am to 4pm 5 days a week. The same holds true for long\\-term traders, and while lacking the constant adrenaline of day trading the highs of closing a trade that\u2019s been on\\-going for months is just as great a feeling \u2013 the analogy one trader used was whereas day traders get Christmas every day, long\\-term traders get all of their Christmases at once, 4\\-5 times a year.\n\nFinancial Freedom \n\nThis is not just about the ability to make a living from trading and the financial markets, but from having the knowledge and understanding of the world of finance to make sound financial decisions, whether that be in deciding between a fixed or variable mortgage, or the best ways to allocate capital to save for school fees.\n\nIntellectual Challenge \n\nThere is undoubtedly both an intellectual and an emotional challenge in trading successfully. While it is said that day traders trade emotion, long term portfolio managers trade on intellect and sound financial decision making.\n\nStyle & Expression \n\nTraders all trade differently, from value investors to crypto speculators each trader develops a style and method of trading that fits their way of life and the perception they have of the world around them. If you are emotional in\\-tune with the wider world, then day trading can be exceptionally profitable. The same holds true for value investors like Warren Buffet, a trader who enjoys digesting and analysing reams of company reports to find what Buffet calls \u201cGreat companies at fair prices\u201d.\n\nThis post has hopefully given you an understanding of the typical day in the life of a trader.
