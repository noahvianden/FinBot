That's 6.50 per trade. Plus I have minimums for options pricing per month (not free!).\n\nTasty is 1.00 per contract per leg plus fees so like 2.14 for a vertical and 0 for closing. That's $2 vs $6 per open and close position for a vertical.\n\nSo I agree with a small account size I'd say tasty or RH is the way to go (I hate entering trades in RH though, also they only allow prices in .05 increments so if you're trying to eek out every dollar like I do sometimes, no dice) ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Didn\u2019t know the .05 part, it\u2019s like they thought of all the ways to be shitty.

But getting a free ToS account which I understand to be doable, or Tasty if possible, would be almost a requirement.. then just enter the trades on RH after going through the data on the better platforms.  With paper trading you could even enter the order simultaneously on ToS to track it better.\n\nAlthough, reading the stories of RH closing profitable positions at a loss and stuff makes me feel it ends up costing.

Sure enough, it dropped to about 0.2 above, virtually zero extrinsic left, so i sold to close for the 80% profit and keeping the shares.\n\nThat\u2019s an optional deviation from the wheel strategy: I like closing for a profit and keeping the stock if I\u2019m still bullish on the underlying though.
