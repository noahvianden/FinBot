If it went to $1,700 then you would make a $11,500 profit.\n\nHowever, if AMZN is even 1 cent below the $1,460 strike price then the option will expire worthless and you lose the $12,500 you paid to buy the option.  \n\nOptions are complicated and you can lose money fast, so please check out the FREE options training at CBOE or OIC, both are excellent and are a must before doing any real money trading.
