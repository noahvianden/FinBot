People are in panic selling their shares and putting them into bonds.  Now in theory this makes sense since the risk free rate known as the 10 year treasury note has been going up.  However, there is something I believe is missing from some people`s thought process.  If you look at this link :https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=US10Y\nIf you click all it shows that since 1978 the rate has been falling.  I havent actually done the math but Im willing to bet that over that same time period if you took 1 share of any blue chip stock say microsoft and reinvested its divided and accounted for splits you would be far better off than bonds.  Yes, you can lose more with stocks however to me it seems stupid to say you should prefer bonds due to lower risk since to me it would suck to lose on a security with low risk than one with higher risk since when you have lower risk you expect to at least keep what you put in originally (cost basis).  \n", "id": "7w8ii1", "created_utc": 1518126955.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "Weak hands and we were due for a correction especially with how spy jumped like 7% in one month.
