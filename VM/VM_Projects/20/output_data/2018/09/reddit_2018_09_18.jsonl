{"title": "FedEx (FDX) buy on weakness?", "selftext": "FedEx reported earnings this afternoon after market close. The company missed on EPS by a decent margin (9%) but a slight beat on revenue\n\nEPS est: $3.803\n\nEPS actual: $3.46\n\nRevenue est: $16.87B\n\nRevenue actual: $17.05B\n\n\nThe EPS miss, as you can surmise, was an issue with expenses coming in higher than expected, leaving the lowest operating margin in quite some time (20.4%).\n\nAn 11% increase in wages drove the margin deterioration, an impact the CEO noted they expected: \n\n\"As expected, the quarter's results were affected by our decision to invest in our team members following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We remain committed to increasing earnings, margins, cash flows and returns this year.\"\n\nThe company estimated that hiring and wage growth reduced EPS by $0.48, covering more than the EPS miss (though they also saw a $.50 EPS boost from a lower tax rate), partly driven by the TNT cyberattack. \n\nWhile the results were mixed (the EPS miss weighs more than the revenue beat) the company actually ended up **raising** full year guidance from $17.00-$17.60 to $17.20-$17.80. The company expects strong performance in FY19 (this was Q1 19 for them) on the back of parcel delivery and strong e-commerce.\n\nIt was reported last week that FedEx expects to hire ~55,000 seasonal workers for the winter holiday, up from the 50,000 they expected to hire last year and the 50,000 they expected in 2016. \n\n\nDespite the miss, FedEx also got analyst upgrades today (and some yesterday before ER):\n\nCompany|Analyst|Price Target|Date|Implied Upside (from AH price)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\nBMO|Fadi Chamoun|$ 300|17-Sep|20.6%|\nCredit Suisse|Allison Landry|$ 315|17-Sep|26.7%|\nBaird|Ben Hartford|$ 265|17-Sep|6.6%|\nStephens Inc|Jack Atkins|$ 306|17-Sep|23.0%|\nCowen|Helane Becker|$ 280|17-Sep|12.6%|\nGoldman Sachs|Matt Reustle|$ 290|16-Sep|16.6%|\nJP Morgan|Brian Ossenbeck|$ 305|11-Sep|22.6%|\nStifel|David Ross|$ 289|10-Sep|16.2%|\nMorgan Stanley|Ravi Shanker|$ 245|6-Sep|-1.5%|\n\nFedEx trades at a 22% below peer forward P/E of 14.1x\n\nFDX 14.1x\n\nUPS 15.4x\n\nPeer mean 18x\n\nJBHT 19.9x\n\nEXPD 22.3x\n\nXPO 27.6x\n\nFDX is currently trading well below its 2 year average forward P/E, touching the bottom range of its forward P/E standard deviation Reaching it's historical average would imply a $270.36 price.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/RpPpA7w.png\n\nThough no one here cares about dividends, FedEx has also grown their dividend 27% over the past year, 36% annual over the past two years, and 31% annually over the past five, with the after hours price drop likely pushing the dividend yield over 1%. \n\nWith Amazon, Wal-Mart, and other giant retailers exploding e-commerce, FedEx and other logistic companies have to shift from infrastructures built for traditional big box retail to those lead by a more tech economy. FedEx expects little to no impact from US/China tariffs (China represents just 2% of their revenues and tariffs effect little of that 2%). The company is also moving to six day workdays to meet holiday demand alongside the seasonal hiring boost. \n\nThe option market priced in a 1.5% move after earnings, but it looks like the sell off will be almost double that. That's obviously not a good sign, but when the dust settles, FedEx could be a good buy on earnings shock and optimistic outlook.

{"title": "MU expanding in Silicon Valley", "selftext": "So we all know about the financial data regarding MU. What hasn't been reported as much is that MU is expanding its presence in Silicon Valley. As you all know, Silicon Valley is a high cost of living area and the salaries are astronomical. Companies move here for one reason, and one reason only, to gain access to the deep pool of high tech engineers.\n\nWell, MU has bought (or leased) a set of three buildings from Brocade and they're expanding their R&D. The buildings are not for manufacturing because nobody in their right mind would open a manufacturing facility smack dab in Silicon Valley (except Tesla). \n\nHere is the original building for Brocade: https://media.glassdoor.com/l/9183/brocade-communications-office.jpg\n\nhttps://1dgh0wk9md-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/brocade-sj.jpg\n\nHere is Micron moving into those buildings: https://i.postimg.cc/5yqxGcT1/IMG_0294.jpg\n\nMU is joining the likes of AMD, Intel, and NVDA in Silicon Valley (OK, they've been here for awhile but now they're really serious).
