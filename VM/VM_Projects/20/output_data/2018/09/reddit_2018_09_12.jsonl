I will add to it 1 or 2 more times. I have done the same with TXN.\n\nBottom line is this is a growing industry with great margins and return on equity at a P/E in high single digits or low double digits. Even if their revenue and margins were to contract significantly, they are still way underpriced. To top this all off they give a very generous dividend.\n\nThis is one of those times you decide what kind of investor you are.

You are better off with CDs or savings accounts.\n\nIf you can afford to put money in the market for years without taking it out, then you should have a long term view with your investments and view downturns as buying opportunities.\n\nA good starting point is an all market index like VTI. Long term it will always go up and will have way less risk and volatility than individual stocks. Also, if you open your account with the operator of the index like Vanguard, you can buy the ETF for free. You should start with that and then educate yourself on how to evaluate stocks. Once comfortable, start with blue chip companies with growing revenue and dividends\n\nVisa is a very good start. In fact, it is my number 1 stock for the future because they have a significant leadership position in their growing market, they keep growing their revenues and their dividends. This is the best type of stock to invest in. Other similarly good stocks are AAPL, MSFT, JPM.....all large caps with great history and competitive advantage that are growing their revenues and dividends.\n\nTo reduce stock buying fees, go with a platform like Robinhood if you don't want to do index investing.\n\nNow as to why LRCX is going down, it is a few things.\n\n1) it is a in a cyclical business which means there are periods of drawdowns and market thinks one is coming.\n\n2) China is a big consumer of chips and trade war is creating uncertainty\n\n3) because of 1, inventories are forecasted to go up with less demand which means lower prices and profits.\n\nThe bull case is this is a company that is growing their revenues in a market that is growing due to new tech like IA and Internet of Things.
