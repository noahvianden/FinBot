{"title": "Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days)", "selftext": "This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

{"title": "MTCH Group Earnings Play - DD", "selftext": "K this is a follow up to my shit post with a hilarious quote from the MTCH CEO.  Some relevant facts \n\n-MTCH continues to steamroll in the online dating space. They own literally ALL the dating apps out there except Bumble which they have a complicated legal relationship with. Bumble accuses them of suing them just to drive down their share price so they can acquire them later. Who knows. The origin of both companies is both shady and fkced up and I won't get into it here.  It's a tale of heartbreak, internet love and casual sex that turned into real feels but that's a story for another day.  Anyhoo MTCH just acquired Hinge which is Bumble's younger, innocent naaive sister aka An App that allows women to upload full profiles and is targeted towards middle to higher income women who want meaningful shit.  MTCH continues to sit on a boatload of cash for future acquisitions and has so far dodged anti trust regulation because the market cap on the industry is relatively small but eventually they won't be able to buy anymore but by then it'll be too late and they'll own everything (sorta like MSFT in the early days before anyone even knew what Enterprise software even meant).  \n\n**The real shit**\n\nThis is the last quarter where comparison to a previous quarter did not include Tinder Gold.  The comp numbers will look astronomically large.  Gold was a runaway success with users continuing to pay more for extra features. ARPU is up bigly and will continue to climb as the app adda more features (such as the ability to make full profiles and women get to control who messages first etc).  \n\nTinder has hinted to the point of blue balling about a new feature which should add significant revenue. They strongly indicated on the last conference call that this feature would be announced at the end of Q2.  \n\nLastly, Tinder continues to push in emerging markets such as India and South Korea.  Pairs in South Korea is growing and continues to bring in good numbers. Domestically the amount of new subscribers should be higher as MTCH has invested in advertising this quarter at a level they have not done in previous quarters (aka college campus appearances with celebs like Adam Levine, traditional ads etc).  \n\n-For the love of God wait till after Wednesday in case FB announces 'Facebook Fuck' or something but then go hard.
