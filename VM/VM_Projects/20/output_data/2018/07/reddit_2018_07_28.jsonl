They air delivered gear from Germany and scrambled to build a tent production line and it took 24/7 labor to hit 5k a week in June. Second quarter was an absolutely expensive Clusterfuck. \n\nThe biggest thing that the market is going to be focused on is the cash situation. They had 2.7 billion at end of Q1, but it's very likely they blew through another billion. That would leave them with 1.7 billion, but almost 900 million of that is customer deposits (treated as a liability until converted to a sale or refund). If they have less than 1 billion on hand that they can freely spend, with the cash burn they've been on, I think people will get awfully nervous. They've got 1.2 billion due in bonds from now til March 2019 and a negative working capital of 2.8 billion. \n\nTesla will try and hit 6k model 3s a week and will release enough new autopilot features to claim full self driving. This is key because a lot of people paid money for FSD, but Tesla can't recognize it as revenue until they have delivered that feature to their customers.\n\nThere's an incredible amount of risk going into the third quarter. If Tesla cannot get themselves into sustainable free cash flow position, I think they're done, as it's going to look really unconvincing that any new borrowing or capital raise is just to pay for current operational losses. As to why they haven't raised capitol at this point, well, there's a few interesting theories on that, but the CFO and CAO both left back in Feb and there's been no insider selling in the company since. Possible they have a Wells notice, but nothing conclusive other than it seems awfully weird a company so strapped for cash hasn't sold more shares with a price above $300. \n\nTrade carefully.

That Bloomberg thing that tracks VINs (seriously, its fucking ridiculous that Tesla is this much under the microscope) has production around 4k sustained and going up.  \n\nA capital raise this year would've probably been smart as it would've given them a lot more cushion in case of a recession.  And if you don't think Elon could raise capital, you're either ignorant, dumb, or autistic (most likely this).  But this is the route he went with.  He wants to squeeze the fuck out of these shorts.
