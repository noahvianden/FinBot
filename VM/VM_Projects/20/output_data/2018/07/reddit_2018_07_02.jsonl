{"title": "Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days)", "selftext": "\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.\nIn fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information\nthat has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,\ninsiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good\ntrack record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Shares Changed|Avg.

The analysts failed to take into account that Tesla would be holding back on Model 3 deliveries to avoid hitting 200,000 lifetime deliveries in the US, triggering the beginning of the phaseout of the federal tax credit.

They have a market cap of $55 billion, higher than Ford. Ford had revenues of 150 billion last year. Tesla had revenues of 11 billion last year. At some point if they're tremendously successful, they will go to \\[say\\] 150 billion a year in revenue, and let's say they make 15 billion in revenue. (Ford made 7 billion on their 150 billion, so that's twice the profit margin. ) They'd be as big as GM or Ford. That's the best possible case, and they'd have a price-to-future-earnings of about 4.
