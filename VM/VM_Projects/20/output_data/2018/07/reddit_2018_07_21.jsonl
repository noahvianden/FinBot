{"title": "Where can I get the financial statements that would be easily imported into a spreadsheet?", "selftext": "I have a Google Sheets where you enter the ticker and it'll bring up the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow. Right now, I'm using Yahoo Finance, which is working great because it actually lays out the whole statement as opposed to just the summary like Google or Bloomberg. The problem is, it defaults to the annual statement, but I'd like the quarterly as well. You can view quarterly by clicking a button on the site, but that doesn't work with importing it, since it's the same URL, etc.\n\nAnyone deal with this kind of thing and know of a good site that lays out the entire statements in both annual *and* quarterly?\n\nEdit: Nevermind! I found marketwatch.com and it works great! If you guys are interested, I'd be happy to share the spreadsheet once I'm done.\n\nEdit 2: Although marketwatch worked, it only lists data in big numbers (ie: \"7.06T\", \"4.66B\"). I was hoping for a bit more specific. Wall Street Journal seems pretty good--annual/quarterly statements on separate pages & they list numbers in the millions and without the annoying letters (having to parse out the \"T\" or \"B\"--while not impossible--makes things more complicated). I'm gonna give it a try and let you know how it works.\n\nEdit 3: I've been working on this damn spreadsheet all day and WSJ has been working out fine, but now I've hit a bit of a snag. The [balance sheet](https://quotes.wsj.com/AAPL/financials/annual/balance-sheet) page automatically collapses the \"Liabilities\" portion, so I can't seem to import that using IMPORTHTML or IMPORTXML--just the \"Assets\" part. I'll try to figure out how to get it working--I'm hoping I won't have to find yet another site to get the data from.", "id": "90oaqd", "created_utc": 1532167551.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "The SEC website,  EDGAR.
