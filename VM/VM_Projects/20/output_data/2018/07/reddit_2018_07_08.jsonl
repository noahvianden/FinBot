", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, that is correct, it appears like a 20% discount. Somehow I felt I was overpaying because once you open this position, and you want to close it, you cannot do so for $0.28, the mid point. You could get a fill at $0.26 may be. Overall you are at a disadvantage soon as you open, is that normal? \n\nI currently have this same position on my portfolio, I am up 50%. Avg. Cost $0.17. ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yep, totally normal. At a minimum, every time you enter a leg of an option position, you instantly 'lose' $0.01 or more to the bid-ask spread. If you're doing a 4 legged position, you're going to be behind by $0.04 or more right away. \n\nWhen looking at this example above, your bid-ask spread is $0.08. You might be able to get it closer to the mid... But using the nat price, you have to make $0.08 just to get to break even... Plus commissions, if any. At my broker, the total cost of commissions would be $0.052. So, I'd need $0.132... \n\n", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Oh wow, that puts you at a disadvantage for sure, atleast I am using Robinhood right now so the commissions are free, otherwise it is not a high probability trade. I was not sure if this is the case for any brokerage because I read somewhere that Robinhood will sell the *order flow* so you never know. I applied and got approved for a Tastyworks account and there butterflies cost $0.04 in commissions, I am yet to start using that actively. \n\nYou are probably better off buying a vertical debit spread if you want a quick fill with less slippages but I seem to like butterflies. I like how you can spend so less, and trade ITM contracts, generate easy 100% returns. But the issue with getting them filled while opening and closing seems to be the highest headache. \n\nEarlier today, I had closed another SPY Butterfly for a 700% gain. I entered at $0.08 last Friday (277/278/279) and closed it before end of day for $0.55ish.\n\nI just opened another 279/280/281 butterfly for 07/11 exp for $0.09.
