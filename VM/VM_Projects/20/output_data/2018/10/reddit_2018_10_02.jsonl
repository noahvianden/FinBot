{"title": "Best TSLA financial model publicly available", "selftext": "A big issue for investors is modeling upcoming quarters. It is a very difficult and time consuming endeavor and a lot of skill is required to update and guess the upcoming numbers based on changing facts with the business. One of the best that is posted publicly is this one:\n\n[https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/3084544/](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/posts/3084544/)\n\nOf course, all projections are subject to a lot of estimating, ie. guessing. But this is a highly informed guess. If you are a serious TSLA investor, you may want to read the entire thread.\n\nThis also helps with rational discussion for Q3 and Q4 earnings. Poke holes in the model, make different assumptions and then see what it does.\n\nIf you put this into your own spreadsheet, you will notice that the actual GAAP earnings itself is not particularly interesting other than for optics. I assume that with a GAAP loss that is close enough, they will cover with ZEV credit sales. Instead, the biggest story is about cash. That model is showing $721 million in free cash flow.\n\nHere is my earlier post on cash posted to another sub:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/9ivnaw/updated\\_analysis\\_of\\_q3\\_profit\\_estimate/](https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/9ivnaw/updated_analysis_of_q3_profit_estimate/)\n\n>I want to note that liquidity is the central focus of investors, especially the bears. So investors will be looking at their cash and credit situation as the #1 metric. Also, since depreciation and stock based compensation are such large portions of their GAAP losses, both of which are non-cash items, it is quite possible to generate lots of cash while reporting a GAAP loss.  \n>  \n>Last quarter, they had a $-130 million loss from operations while reporting a GAAP loss around $700 million. They will be very much cash flow from ops positive this quarter.  \n>  \n>They will ship roughly double the number of Model 3\u2019s this quarter and the cash conversion cycle will mean massive cash generation. I know already that there are quite a few of you that will scream that they didn\u2019t pay their suppliers as the accounts payable will increase dramatically. But the days payable outstanding (DPO) staying exactly the same as it has for the last two quarters will mean massive cash generation. One can go back and calculate DPO from previous quarters. With \\~80 days of DPO which is much lower than it has been at times, Tesla is paying suppliers for production from 80 days ago on a rolling basis through the year while collecting payments, mostly COD for vehicle deliveries. The average difference is double the deliveries in Q3 versus Q2. An analyst asked about this during the last ER and Deepak confirmed that the effect is in the magnitude of $23,000 per vehicle.  \n>  \n>This means there isn\u2019t a liquidity crisis now that we know they are delivering lots of cars. As Tesla said before, the Model 3 program will generate cash.  \n>  \n>I think some people make the mistake in thinking that GAAP losses means cash losses. Or that a meager GAAP profit means meager cash increase. That is not the case. I am modeling about $1 billion positive cash flow from operations and $500+ million net gain in cash in Q3. The final result depends on the amount of collateralized lease borrowing. That is with a GAAP profit of $15 million with $100 million in ZEV credits which still gives them plenty for Q4 if they choose to sell it then. I don\u2019t think they need it for Q4.  \n>  \n>This effect extends into Q4 at least. It gets more complicated in Q1 though, as international deliveries start and we don\u2019t have a good idea on their volume expansion.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "9ktdax", "created_utc": 1538505866.0, "score": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "Damn, this model is insane. $720M in free cash flow, $1.43 non-gaap EPS?
