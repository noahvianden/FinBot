{"title": "Dumb ! investor that made a stupid move :(", "selftext": "Hello Reddit! \n\nI have recently decided to embark on a journey towards day trading. I'm still in the 'information gathering' phase, and I've opened an account. Instead of doing things the right way (due diligence, paper trading accounts, any serious kind of technical analysis, screening, etc...), I bought 1000 shares @ **0.40$US**/share of a company called Tidal Royalty. They provide funding for startups in the American marijuana industry, in exchange for a % of the company's profits. I bought this because I got an emailed \"Alert\" from a company that claimed it may be the \"next big Netflix\" stock. So I used my \"gut\" (stupid mistake, never again!!) and spent 400$US. Since then it dropped about 50%, so I'm down 200$US. I feel gutted, stupid and never will I buy a stock based on hype, ONE article I read online, and with so much emotion. I wanted quick easy money and instead I lost 200 bucks. I did learn a valuable lesson however, and I'm glad I did so early and without having lost too much $$. I do feel like the article was just sent out as a way to influence dumb \"traders\" like myself. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith this said, does anyone have any advice for a young and inexperienced trading \"student\" (I wouldn't dare call myself a trader yet)? Also, what should I do with the 1000 shares I still have in this company?
