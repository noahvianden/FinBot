{"title": "Earning's whisper most anticipated earnings list culled for option traders.", "selftext": "A huge list to cull this week. This is earningwhisper.com's \"most anticipated\" earnings for this coming week culled out for option traders.\n\nThis is my opinion of options that I'll consider for earnings plays. Not a recommendation and I don't have advice on what type of play you should open.\n\nIf you didn't catch the previous posts, every week someone is kind enough to post the graphic from earningswhisper.com for upcoming earnings. While I find it a great starting point, the list isn't well suited for option spreads without a lot of gutting. I used to do this and keep it to myself, but others find value, so I'm sharing it. My reasons for cutting out companies may not match your own, so I listed the reasons why I removed it.\n\n**The final cut list is first.**\n\n\nSymbol | Report Day\n---|---\nBAC|M BMO\nSCHW|M
