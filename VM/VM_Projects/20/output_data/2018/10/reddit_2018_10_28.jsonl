{"title": "Vertical Spread", "selftext": "I've been selling vertical spreads on AMZN on the same day they expire (every Friday) for the last few months and so far it's worked out in my favor.

I'm fully open to any criticism as I'm not trying to break the bank.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.  I never initiate my trades any earlier than 10AM.  This gives the market as a whole time to shake out the early morning jitters.  I do, however, fully understand that nothing is guaranteed by waiting until 10 and that the longer I wait the less premium I will collect.  \n2. When I select the strike price of the option I sell I have been using Prob OTM in Think Or Swim and so far I have NOT used anything less than 80%.\n3. I do my best not to babysit the position once it is open.  I definitely set alerts in TOS that let me know if the initial strike is reached but as of today (I've been lucky in this regard) when the strike is reached it has so far retraced in the direction that I need.  For insight into my psychological state on Friday look at the chart as it climbed and then dropped off.  I sold 1660 Calls on Friday.  I did notice the ascending triangle formation on the one minute chart but I had a gut feeling that it would likely peak and drop off based on the fact that it was Friday.  \n4. I let both legs expire worthless at market close which is nice because I'm not paying additional commission to close the position.

Reporting earnings on Tuesday, October 30th - there is a lot of negative investor sentiment which has brought down share price considerably. The Cambridge Scandal, privacy issues, concerns over the EU regulatory environment changes, and general fears about NA user growth have created a great opportunity to start to accumulate shares. \n\nFrom a peer valuation standpoint, there isn't a tech company with the same level of growth and free cash flow generation with a PE multiple of 22. If FB maintains its 22 business multiple and grows in earnings 15% YoY for the next 3 years (which is a rather conservative view imo) Facebook would easily trade above $200 per share. \n\nWhether Facebook is good for society or not is a separate topic, but from a business standpoint, the fact that people are 'addicted' to Facebook is a great thing for advertisers. I can't go anywhere without seeing people staring down at their phones, scrolling through Facebook or Instragram, or posting their food because we all know you get more nutrients that way. \n\nYou can check out a technical chart of Facebook on [tradingview.com](https://tradingview.com) for a very sleek and free technical charting. If you click indicators and overlays you can find a public library of the most popular free indicators that people have created. Indicators by Chris Moody are my favorite. \n\nOn [FinViz.com](https://FinViz.com) check out the Bubble Charts, in the video above I show an example where I put earnings growth next year on the x-axis and one year price performance on the y-axis. Facebook and Cognizant show up as good opportunities. \n\nRegardless of the earnings report in the near-term, Facebook is a great business to own. Should shares continue to fall, I will continue to buy. \n\nDisclosure: I own FB call options\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "9s6z4p", "created_utc": 1540762436.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "Agree with OP.
