The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.1 percent to 7,167.21. At its lows, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had fallen more than 3 percent.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 fell 1.7 percent to 2,658.69 and briefly entered into correction territory, trading more than 10 percent below its record high reached in September. The average stock market correction, since WWII, results in a 13 percent drop and lasts for four months if it does not turn into a full-fledged bear market.\n*****\n> Larry Benedict, CEO of The Opportunistic Trader, said traders \"don't want to be long heading into the weekend.\" He added, \"S&P now down on the year and people are more afraid to be long today than they were when market was 10 percent higher.\"\n*****\n> Seven of the 11 S&P 500 sectors are down at least 10 percent from their 52-week highs, including energy, materials and financials. Around three quarters of the index's stocks are also in a correction.\n*****\n> \"The 19.7 percent correction in 2011 is as close to a bear market as we've had in recent years. I don't think we'll get close to that, but I think we're heading for a deeper correction than the one we had in January and early February,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. He noted investors are realizing that earnings growth will slow down moving forward, thus they are pricing this in.\n*****\n> Among the driving forces for the market's sharp drop on Friday were disappointing earnings from key tech companies that overshadowed strong economic data.\n*****\n> Amazon fell 7.8 percent after the company released its latest quarterly results on Thursday. Alphabet shares, meanwhile, dropped as much as 5.6 percent before closing 1.8 percent lower. Earnings for both companies topped analyst estimates, but revenues fell short.\n*****\n> There were \"high expectations\" for this earnings season, King Lip, chief strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management, told CNBC. \"The earnings are not coming in as great as people had suspected,\" Lip said, adding that \"for Amazon specifically, forward guidance was surprisingly light.\"\n*****\n> These declines were enough to offset a better-than-expected report on U.S. economic growth. The Commerce Department reported the U.S. economy grew at a 3.5 percent rate in the third quarter, above a 3.4 percent estimate. The government also said its personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, a key measure of inflation, increased by 1.6 percent last quarter.\n*****\n> Stock have suffered in recent weeks as fears of rising inflation \u2014 and rising interest rates \u2014 trim corporate profit expectations. Since the PCE index is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, any sign that the measure may be slowing could stall the central bank in its plan to continue to increase the overnight rate.\n*****\n> Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, surged by 4 percent in the third quarter, the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2014.\n*****\n> \"The GDP number really solidified some of the points that have been made for the fourth quarter,\" said Minh Trang, senior FX trader at Silicon Valley Bank. \"The Fed is still on track for another rate hike\" even though the inflation numbers were a bit weaker than expected.\n*****\n> The major averages posted big losses for the week. The S&P 500 and Dow dropped 3.9 percent and 3 percent this week, respectively. The Nasdaq pulled back 3.8 percent.\n*****\n> These losses add to a sharp drop seen throughout this month. For October, the Dow and S&P 500 are down 6.7 percent and 8.8 percent, respectively. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, has lost 10.9 percent. The Dow is now on pace for its biggest one-month decline since May 2010, and the S&P 500 is tracking for its biggest monthly loss since February 2009. The Nasdaq is set for its largest one-month pullback since October 2008.\n*****\n> \"What's happened is we have a number of outside issues overshadowing what has been strong economic data and overall good earnings,\" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.\n*****\n> Several factors have conspired to knock markets down this month \u2014 some earnings disappointment, fear of rising interest rates, a brewing conflict between Italy and the European Union over budget spending, criticism of oil power Saudi Arabia after the killing of a dissident journalist and finally, worries that world growth is losing steam.\n*****\n> *[(Click Here to read the full article!)](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/19/wall-street-futures-point-to-a-slight-rebound-after-the-dow-sheds-300-points.html)*\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P HEAT MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/XTWP6jE.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/FkEh7RS.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/QN32uid.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/XbMGw5D.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WpyINtw.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/TXdLeyv.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3H0Rvi4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/zeAR0qx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5VwsSKY.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cgN1B9Y.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/AN0aKIP.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sc4SB9d.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/he2JuEa.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# When Do Markets Get Volatile?\n\n> After the S&P 500 Index\u2019s least volatile third quarter since 1963, October has ushered in a wave of volatility: Daily moves in excess of 1% now feel like the norm.\n\n> Here\u2019s what you need to know about volatility: It tends to happen when the S&P 500 is in a downtrend and beneath the 200-day moving average. For example, the S&P 500 gained more than 7.0% in the third quarter and did not gain more than 1% in a single day. In contrast, the S&P 500 has gained more than 1% three times already this month, but it is still down 7.2% so far in October.\n\n> The 200-day moving average is simply the average close of the previous 200-day trading days. This is a long-term trendline that many investors use to determine if stocks are in an uptrend or downtrend, but history has shown that the most volatility tends to happen beneath this trendline.\n\n> \u201cBig moves tend to happen beneath the 200-day moving average,\u201d said LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, 23 of the 25 largest one-day rallies for the S&P 500 took place beneath the 200-day moving average.\u201d\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the majority of the largest gains and losses took place beneath the 200-day moving average. With the S&P 500 currently beneath this important trendline, more volatility could be in store for investors.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/The-LArgest-Daily-Changes-Tend-to-Happen-Beneath-the-200-Day-Moving-Average.jpg?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Five Takeaways on October\u2019s Rough Ride\n\n> October has been a rough month for equities, but then again it\u2019s historically been one of the most volatile periods of the year.\n\n> \u201cOctober is known for volatility, and we\u2019ve sure seen it so far,\u201d explained Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cIn fact, by many measures, October is poised to be one of the worst months in years. The S&P 500 Index has had two separate six-day losing streaks this month for the first time in history. That pretty much sums it up.\u201d\n\n> Here are five takeaways from October\u2019s action so far:\n\n> The bad news.\n\n> * The S&P 500 is down 8.8% month to date, which would make this the worst month since February 2009 and the worst October since 2008 if it finishes the month at its current level.\n\n> * After not posting a daily move of more than 1% throughout the entire third quarter for the first time since 1963, this month has already seen six days out of 18 (33%) close at least 1% higher or lower.\n\n> * The S&P 500 has been down 14 days so far in October, the most for any month since May 2012. Also, 78% of the days this month have closed in the red (14 of 18), the worst for any month since 82% of days in April 1970 closed down.\n\n> Now, for some good news.\n\n> * Since 1950, there have been seven other years when the S&P 500 was positive year-to-date at the end of September, but fell negative year to date at some point during the month of October. The final two months of those years were higher six times and up 4.1% on average.\n\n> * Historically, the last few days of October have been some of the strongest of the year. With markets looking extremely oversold, the stage could be set for a rally.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/stocks-tend-to-bounce-the-last-part-of-october.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# November Kicks Off the \u201cBest Months\u201d\n\n> November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. The month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down \u201322.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ\u2019s second worst month on record\u2014only October 1987 was worse.\n\n> November begins the \u201cBest Six Months\u201d for the DJIA and S&P 500, and the \u201cBest Eight Months\u201d for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don\u2019t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-three DJIA (since 1950) and NASDAQ (since 1971) month. November is second best for S&P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 2000 (since 1979). November is the Russell 1000\u2019s best month (since 1979).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ecf3f65936f368406442f83e6867c3cd/tumblr_inline_ph7z8tWpgo1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n> In midterm years, November\u2019s market prowess is relatively unchanged. DJIA has advanced in 13 of the last 17 midterm years since 1950 with an average gain of 2.5%. S&P 500 has also been up in 13 of the past 17 midterm years, gaining on average 2.6%. Small-caps perform well with Russell 2000 climbing in 6 of the past 9 midterm years, averaging 3.5%. The only real blemish in the November midterm-year record is 1974 (DJIA \u20137.0%, bear market ended in December).\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for October 26th, 2018** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET UP!)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 10.28.18 - Down the Rabbit Hole** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]()**\n(VIDEO NET YET UP!)\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$FB** \n> * **$AAPL** \n> * **$BABA** \n> * **$GE** \n> * **$IQ** \n> * **$MA** \n> * **$BIDU** \n> * **$EBAY** \n> * **$CHK** \n> * **$XOM** \n> * **$EA** \n> * **$TEVA** \n> * **$GM** \n> * **$UAA** \n> * **$TNDM** \n> * **$BP** \n> * **$SPOT** \n> * **$ON** \n> * **$FDC** \n> * **$ADP** \n> * **$CVX** \n> * **$KO** \n> * **$AMRN** \n> * **$SBUX** \n> * **$X** \n> * **$ABBV** \n> * **$PFE** \n> * **$FIT** \n> * **$PAYC** \n> * **$YNDX** \n> * **$OLED** \n> * **$ABMD** \n> * **$WTW** \n> * **$ANET** \n> * **$WLL** \n> * **$LL** \n> * **$FEYE** \n> * **$DDD** \n> * **$RIG** \n> * **$SNE** \n> * **$KEM** \n> * **$NWL** \n> * **$STX** \n> * **$BAH** \n> * **$FTNT**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5VwsSKY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Tm9ItoK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AM PRE-MARKET EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/sZveIM1.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> #
