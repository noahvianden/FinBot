{"title": "Apple ER DD", "selftext": "Continuation from here:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/9pep4w/apple_market_neutral_play/?utm_source=reddit-android\n\nThis is pure speculation. I didn't make a killing in today's Gap up from my yesterday position because I am playing for the ER. I switched to puts today and kind of Played a covered puts with some profits on the table.\n\nWhy I am so madly behind Apple \nApple is the fulcrum for the Dow and s&p.The Dow and s&p are still in green for the year.Agreed Buffet and Apple are buying the stock madly.But think about this would not they be interested to buy the stock more at a lower price?\n\nApple is going to have a bad quarter simply because of the rest of the world sales. Admittedly 65% of the business is outside US. The Dollar was strong and the DXY was roughly 94-96 which Apple themselves said 30 basis points knocked out of their earnings. I guess they were just kidding considering some currencies like Yuan moved as much as 10% .\n\nThe new iPhone X Max should be declared as the biggest goof up by Apple simply because it is sexist and I have heard that from iPhone fan girls\n\nGlobal slowdown led by China\nChina Is in a bear market and has fallen 34% in 4 months indicating a 1929 like depression. Apple has 19% market share from China. \n\nIt's not only China the rest of the world is also weak and their currencies are also weak. This reduces the purchasing power of consumer and in a gloomy scenario lesser people are going to upgrade their phones .\n\nThis being a S year we are in bust cycle.The stock had a mad run from 169-225 non stop without any major potential product pipeline. To me this is an epic pump and dump strategy by Wall Street. The slope of the rise and double top indicate a major downside potential.\n\nRemember when Apple goes down it's going to take everything down.\nDOW,S&P, NASDAQ\nI am buying puts and I am still trying to be neutral while buying puts but I want to put forth my thought process.\n\n\n\n", "id": "9pr50d", "created_utc": 1540009363.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Why cuz there hands aren\u2019t big enough ?
