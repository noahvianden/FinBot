{"title": "[Research] $TSLA", "selftext": "#The Cyborg Swarm: Tesla’s First Real Chance to Disrupt\n------------\n\nLast October, Tesla initiated a global machine learning effort to accelerate the development of fully autonomous transport. Success here opens up multiple opportunities in the $10 trillion market for mobility. \n\n***Let’s begin with a simple question: Has Tesla truly disrupted the auto industry? We would argue, no. Not yet, at least.*** While Tesla deserves credit for bringing to market a compelling EV, we would not go so far as to say that the company has disrupted the auto industry business model. In fact, many aspects of Tesla’s business (private ownership, human driving) are reminiscent of the auto business model familiar to Henry Ford over 100 years ago. Going 0 to 60 in under 3 seconds in a $120,000 car is not disruptive, in our view. For Tesla to secure its long term growth, profitability and independence we believe this must eventually change. \n\n\n***Tesla’s mission statement: 'to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable transport'.*** Since the company’s inception, the market has focused almost myopically on Tesla's EVs. However, in addition to the consumption of finite natural resources (approx. 500 billion gallons of gasoline consumed annually – equal to ½ a cubic mile of fuel), there are other key areas where the current auto industry is unsustainable and can be addressed by technology, in our view: \n\n***(1) Utilization.*** On a vehicle basis, cars are utilized less than 4% of the time. On an available seat mile basis, cars are utilized slightly more than 1% of the time. This has not changed materially in over a century. \n\n***(2) Time.*** At an average speed of 25mph, the world’s drivers spend around 400 billion hours behind the wheel. At an economic value of around $10/hour, this implies a value-of-time spent in the car at around $4 trillion. A very significant portion of an average driver’s non-sleeping, non-working time is spent behind the wheel. See our October 6th 2015 report: The Car as a 'Time Machine': What’s 400 Billion Hours Worth? \n\n***(3) Safety.*** According to the WHO, nearly 3,500 people die in traffic-related accidents globally every day. In the US, motor vehicle accidents represent by far the #1 cause of death of young people (21% of population age between 1 and 24 years old based on 2013 data) and are on track to claim nearly 40k lives in total in 2016. Social externalities like this may also be considered unsustainable. \n\n***Autonomous cars can address multiple unsustainable features of the current auto industry.*** While the fundamental technologies of Level 4 (fully autonomous) cars are well developed today, there is a significant amount of development and testing required to make autonomous driving not just safer than human driving, but many thousands of times safer. Our discussions with academics and scientists in this field suggest there is no substitute for real world testing on public roads to immerse these vehicles in the chaotic, unpredictable situational/physical world of driving. \n\n\n***Google’s self-driving car program is currently logging more than 15k miles per week of autonomous driving, accumulating more than 1.2 million autonomous miles since inception. Tesla’s global fleet of around 100k Model S units is driving (on our estimates) in aggregate nearly 1 billion miles per year or nearly 3 million miles per day.*** On our calculations, this figure should double over the next 15 to 18 months. While Tesla’s vehicles are not currently equipped with a sensor suite as rich as a Google autonomous testing prototype (and while not all of Tesla’s miles traveled are autonomous miles) the mere scale of the swarm of connected, semi-autonomous EVs puts Tesla at a potentially material advantage vs. peers. Tesla’s cars are actively collecting information about the vehicle and its physical surroundings for learning at a local and centralized level on a global scale and in near real time. Tesla’s continual development of a network of assets in the field (charging stations, stores, service centers) complement the effort. \n\n***We cannot say with certainty what Tesla is learning from its fleet nor how great this advantage is, if any. The market is reliant on Tesla to communicate its findings and to implement any learnings in future updates of software and hardware over time.*** It is our view that, like all major car companies, Tesla’s business of selling human-driven machines utilized <4% of the time is not sustainable. Firms like Ferrari (rated OW, $56 target) may target a niche market that values driving pleasure over mere transportation. However, we believe Tesla has far greater ambitions to provide transportation solutions and services at a very large scale. \n\n\n***Nearly 100% of the upside to our $450 price target for Tesla is predicated on the development of a shared electric autonomous transport service we have called Tesla Mobility. In our opinion, excluding such a potential initiative would be adverse to the risk-adjusted return inherent in the equity price.*** Clearly, we believe Tesla has an opportunity to lead the industry in shared autonomous transport, but not without risk. Specifically, we’d highlight 3 main risks that investors must consider heading into 2016: \n\n***(1) Burn rate***. Tesla may have proven skeptics wrong with its ability to bring to market an exciting and functional EV, but it has yet to prove wrong those who doubt they can do so with strong margins and cash flow. In fact, difficulties in manufacturing and high spending on future projects have come at a cost of very high cash burn relative to both sales and market cap. \n\n***(2) Access to financial capital.*** Starting any new business is hard work. But Tesla has enjoyed access to attractively priced, long-term capital to fund cash burn while making a host of long-dated technology investments. Elon Musk’s ability to raise capital has been critical to the evolution of the firm’s commercial ambition. The next 12 months will require a continuation of this relationship for Tesla to sustain its investment with minimal dilution. \n\n***(3) Access to human capital.*** We can imagine that, in his effort to transform the auto industry with software technology, Elon Musk could have expected the likes of Apple (OW, $108.80, covered by Katy Huberty) and Google (OW, $750.03, covered by Brian Nowak) to one day present a formidable competitive force. Perhaps he didn’t expect that day to come so soon. Tesla finds itself competing for the most precious resource required to maintain and accelerate a sustainable advantage in the disruption of automotive transport: talent. It is our understanding that numerous firms, both public and private, incumbent and new-entrant are compiling teams of advanced software engineers and experts in fields such as robotics and AI with the focus on developing autonomous EVs. Tesla is not alone in this battle. \n", "id": "3xv143", "created_utc": 1450808231.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "> Nearly 100% of the upside to our $450 price target for Tesla is predicated on the development of a shared electric autonomous transport service we have called Tesla Mobility.  \n\nSounds just like WSB.

Autopilot in airplanes isn't nearly as advanced as you think. Check out [this article](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/07/130709-planes-autopilot-ask-a-pilot-patrick-smith-flying-asiana/):\n\n> One of the most stubborn myths in all of aviation is this notion that pilots just sit there while the plane flies itself from City A to City B. It's infuriating to know that people believe this, because it's utterly false. Airplanes do not fly themselves. The crew flies the airplane through the automation. A plane cannot fly itself any more than an operating room, with all of its advanced technical equipment, is able to perform an organ transplant by itself. The equipment makes things easier, but the operation itself is controlled by humans.\n\nAutopilot in planes and \"autopilot\" in cars are two completely different problems with different technology involved. Car \"autopilot\" is a lot more akin to a drone flying itself than it is to a commercial airliner flying on autopilot.\n\nI think the technology for self-driving cars will definitely catch on within the next 5 to 10 years and I'm looking forward to it.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Once we work out the kinks, we should be good.
