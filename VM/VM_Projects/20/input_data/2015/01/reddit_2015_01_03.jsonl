If people give facebook a poor outlook, it's because they don't understand the company or understand Facebook's place on the internet. Facebook should be looked at as the Google of Social Networks.\n\nFacebook's revenue has grown significantly since going public.  If you compare Facebook to a similar company, such as twitter, then you really start to see why facebook is at their 52 week high.  In fact, Facebook bought Instagram, which is the 2nd most popular social network in terms of users, which is **ahead of Twitter**.  Instagram is in it's infancy for monetizing.  Not only that, but they bought a Virtual Reality company that can be a significant player in a few years when a consumer product is released.\n\nFacebook's PE is good when compared to similar companies and great when you compare it to where it was just 2 years ago.\n\nI think Facebook will be in the 80-90 range for most of 2015.  Unless investors freak about about nothing, which is often the case with Facebook.\n\nAs for Tesla, it's a huge risk.  If you can buy Tesla at the 200 area, then you are fine, but I would never buy too high above that number.  Mostly because their future is still so far away.  Their gigafactory will likely hit delays, which will cause the stock to fall.  Their cheaper car, which is still far away, will likely hit delays.  Their current sales numbers won't be enough to impress anyone.  Tesla mostly gets by because Musk is good at playing with investors and making announcements to inflate the stock.  Tesla is like Apple with plenty of fanboys, except without the revenue to back up the hype.\n\nI can't tell you what Tesla will be at in 2015 because its an irrational stock.  ", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "fanboys, hype and the other non-relevant cases you tried to make against the company probably actually end up helping the company and is partially in fact the reason a company such as Apple that you compared it to is at where it is at today", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "> fanboys, hype and the other non-relevant cases you tried to make against the company probably actually end up helping the company\n\nIn the short term it does. Extreme amounts of hype often lead to lower amounts of hype which could be detrimental to the share price.\n\nYes, those things are good now, but who would want to buy into the top?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Although we disagree, \nIt looks like you have a thorough understanding of FB, and I have a thorough understanding of TSLA, and we each think the other doesn't understand each others stocks. I don't see the revenue growth in FB necessary to justify its valuation, and I don't see it as a strong stock because it doesn't have too much of a cult following relative to other stocks like TSLA and AAPL. Moreover, Facebook has very low short interest, so if it corrects even slightly, you will not see a quick bounce and recovery as shorts cover. I agree with you that FB is an awesome company, and I think they can grow their revenue further, but I doubt that FB can grow their revenue to 1/2 Google's levels, which is what they need to justify the current valuation. Facebook is a crowded trade on the long side, and when high valuations are combined with crowds, there is huge risk. If the market crashes, Facebook will crash hard because its not a cult and it has very little shorting activity to prop it up.\n\nTSLA, on the other hand, offers a clear path to revenue, gross profit, operating profit, and net profit growth. You say that a primary reason that TSLA is risky is that they might hit delays. Anything \"might\" happen, but Tesla is almost a year ahead of schedule on their Gigafactory because they figured out a way to start production (before the factory as a whole is completely finished) in June 2016 instead of 2017. Since their cheaper model depends only on the Gigafactory, the cheaper model is also unlikely to be delayed. Tesla is quite rational compared to Facebook because Tesla is in a yet-to-mature electric car industry (in which they are a front runner) and they get a high valuation because they are disruptive. Facebook gets a high valuation in a mature industry, and it needs to more than double revenues to justify their current valuation, yet it is an already mature company. Tesla is speculative, but not irrational. Moreover, Tesla has a high short interest and a cult following with many long term holders, so it is unlikely to crash as hard ad FB in the event of a market-wide crash. Even in the event of delays for Tesla's plans, the stock will be propped up by short covering and the long term holders that are unwilling to sell and simply take advantage of the cheaper price. ", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Very well said.  I never thought to account for a cult following to justify stock movements, though it makes sense.  I also would like to add that I own both stocks, so I do believe in both of them.\n\nFacebook has a very good track record for revenue growth.  Facebook went from 400~ million in 2011 and will likely hit 2+ billion in 2015.  That growth is all based on Facebook monetization only (and a few other smaller companies, but nothing to make a big dent).  That's not counting potential revenue from Instagram (revenue begins in 2015) and Oculus Rift sales sometime in the near future.  \n\nWill they reach Google levels of revenue?  Probably not. I also think that they don't have to to justify their valuation. I don't know what the fair valuation comparisons even are. I suppose if you are a fan of Facebook you compare them to Twitter or LinkedIn.  If you don't like Facebook, then you compare them to Apple or Google.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind that Facebook is 95% software company (excluding oculus rift).  They can do things and scale products to levels that only a handful of companies can do (Amazon, Google).  It costs them little to think up a new product or test new methods to increase revenue.  Over time, all of that adds up with little risk and high reward.  If Facebook finds a way to expand in China and other areas of the world then their profits would soar even more.  They are already in a position that it could happen since they are the market leader.\n\nTesla is trying to desperately become a player in the electric car market.  Tesla's valuation is based on speculation.  Think about the amount of cars that Tesla needs to sell to account for their current valuation, let alone if their stock is at a 52 week high. 100% of Tesla stock price is based off of future \"could-be\" and \"what ifs\", whereas Facebook already makes tons of money and has revenue to back up their stock price.  If Facebook drops to 60, their revenue already justifies that valuation.  I would scoop up that stock in buckets if the bottom fell out like that.  **If Tesla drops to 150, they have no revenue to even justify that valuation**! (Though I would still buy it, because I believe in them)\n\nMy point is that Tesla makes physical goods.  Cars.  Perhaps the hardest product to sell and the hardest market to enter.  It carries enormous risk.  BMW just entered this market and [already sells more cars than Tesla](http://www.thestreet.com/story/12866305/1/bmws-electric-car-crushes-tesla-on-the-sales-charts.html).  \n\nTesla has a clear roadmap to what they have to do, but can they do it?  Tesla is risky because they are already one of the most overvalued companies out there.  Heck even Amazon has less risk than Tesla, and they showed no profits last quarter.  At least Amazon has enormous revenue, they just don't have the profits.  \n\nTesla is 0/2. No profits and no revenue.  Facebook has revenue and profits.\n\nTesla has few profits today and delays are something that should be expected.  Production on their SUV has been delayed and design work on their cheaper Model S is not close to a final product.  Did you read about the history of Tesla and how many delays they had just getting the company off the ground? Did you [watch their documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7J-tlrkVEE)?  Tesla almost went bankrupt.  They had to take money up-front for pre-orders to a car that was delayed over and over again.  Granted that is early Tesla, but it just shows you the difficulties that comes with being a car company.\n\nThe road to success for Telsa isn't as simple as waiting on cheaper/smaller batteries then releasing a mass market electric car.  They don't have their mass market car remotely close to ready.  They are essentially making a compact Model S for the masses, which involves serious R&D with significant design changes.  Serious costs, for a company that barely makes any money today.  They would then have 3 production cars, and 4 if you count their highest end roadster.  Plus they have Dual Motor cars and Single Motor cars.  Model X won't come until \"Early 2016\".\n\nCan they handle that many models?  Do they know how to scale to those levels?  Do they have any experience in that area?  Can they handle additional costs for the next 2 years if current sales remain at their current levels?  If they are met with more delays?  What materials will be required to mass produce batteries?  Are the cost of materials for batteries expected to climb or be cheaper over time?  \n\nSounds like a tough roadmap to me?  Tesla has **never released a car to date without significant delays**.\n\nFacebook doesn't have any of this to worry about.  They make software. I'm a software engineer myself, so I know exactly what goes into it.\n\nIt sounds like I hate Tesla, but I really do love them.  I want their car and own the stock.  You could say I'm a fanboy even.  I'm just cautious when it comes to their outlook and stock price.\n\nPersonally, I think Tesla will make more money on their gigafactory and possibly becoming the #1 supplier of next generation batteries than they will make on cars.  I don't know what the margins are on cars, but I bet batteries are better.  If they position themselves to supply batteries for electric cars, cell phones, and laptops, then the sky's the limit.  The amount of cars they sell would be a moot point.\n\nAgain I love Tesla, but they are about as risky as risky gets.

Tesla is a much better long term investment especially after the large pull back. Many investors scoff at the stock because they believe it is irrational or overvalued, based on what they learned in college (P/E, P/S, P/B ratios). However, the stock acts pretty rationally and is valued on high future potential. It is important to understand the psychology of Tesla investors in order to gauge whether you belong in the crowd. The majority of Tesla investors are holding long term and are die hard Tesla fans, making Tesla a cult stock. The rest of Tesla investors are known as \"weak longs\" who are willing to sell before any of Tesla's bigger plans are carried out. What happened in the recent pull back is almost all of the weak longs exited the stock at the same time. When the supply of weak longs dwindled, the stock price bottomed and reversed upwards. In the short term, I believe many weak longs will slowly reenter the stock, especially after the national auto show, multiple good reviews of Tesla's P85D, and the 2014 consumer reports car brand survey (which I think will show that Tesla gained a lot of free publicity in 2014). The only short term event that will cause the stock to move quickly on either direction would be the quarterly report on February.  \n\nAnyway, you have to evaluate whether you belong in the weak long crowd or strong believer in the company and its potential.
