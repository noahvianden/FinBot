{"title": "New to Trading, Looking for Advice", "selftext": "I'm pretty young and completely new to stocks, last year I decided to make my first purchase and got 40 shares of Nintendo (NTDOY) simply because they're a company I love and believe in.  But with their stock recently beginning to tank despite regaining profitability, I think it's time to bail out and upgrade.  I'm thinking NVidia (NVDA) because of a lot of reading I've been doing over the future of self driving cars, but I'm open to suggestions (so long as they're in my price range).  I'm also considering waiting until Nintendo's fiscal year end in March to see what happens with their earnings and price.

The price of a stock is determined largely by the number of shares outstanding. Example. Two companies both \"worth\" 100 dollars. Company 1 sells 100 shares on market. Company 2 sells 10 shares on market.\n\nNow the stock price of Company 1 is $1(1x100=100), while Company 2 is $10(10x10=100).\n\nDoes this mean Company 2 is outside your price range? I've always wondered about this logic.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Company 1?  Because they have more shares?

You're buying the same earnings potential. You spend $10 on company 1, in theory you've purchased 10% of the company. You spend $10 on company 2, again in theory you've purchased 10% of the company.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "When I say \"price range\" I mean I currently have about $600 I can afford to use in trade and potentially take a loss on (I know that's tiny, but I have to start somewhere).  I want a good balance between share price and quantity so I can try to maximize my investment's value and potential return.

The demand for shares has tanked recently because the company revised its financial and sales forecasts to significantly smaller numbers due to underperformance in the market (basically the opposite of what I hoped recent product launches would cause to happen), which is making a lot of holders want to sell, so the value of shares declined (now down nearly 19% from where I purchased at).  What I'm gathering from everyone commenting here though is that the face value of the price is irrelevant without the context of the shares outstanding and all of the other company data and overall worth, and that 19% drop is just as painful on my 40 shares bought at one price as it would be if I had bought 4 shares at a price ten times that, so I should stop focusing on strictly the change in dollar amount and more on the percentages affecting it?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">What I'm gathering from everyone commenting here though is that the face value of the price is irrelevant without the context of the shares outstanding and all of the other company data and overall worth,\n\nCorrect.\n\n>and that 19% drop is just as painful on my 40 shares bought at one price as it would be if I had bought 4 shares at a price ten times that, so I should stop focusing on strictly the change in dollar amount and more on the percentages affecting it?\n\nIn that case both the % and $ change would be the same.

You have no idea what Amazon will do, maybe their drone delivery idea actually works out sooner than people think possible right now, maybe they get bought out at a high premium. Just because a stock is trading at a low dollar value does not mean it has more of a potential to \"explode\". And Amazon most definitely will not stay at the same level of +- 3%, that's ridiculous. They gained over 50% in 2013 and have dropped over 20% since then. Besides, the point was not to comment on Amazon in particular, that's just the example OP mentioned. The point was to show that the share price alone does not tell you anything about the growth prospects of a company, if it is a good buy, how risky it is, etc. You need to take much more information into account and limiting your search to stocks that are trading in a certain price range is not a good strategy.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "your right but thats not how NEW people see it.

Buying 2 shares of a $300 stock is no different than buying 20 shares of a $30 stock - stock prices rise and fall on percentage points.
