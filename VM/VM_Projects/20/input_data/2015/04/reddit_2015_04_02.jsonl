We see it as a fun and easy way to follow the market with people you personally know and trust. \n\nWe are in the super early stages but have been beta testing with university investment groups from some of the top business schools around the country. We only have a few beta spots left - but it would be great to get the feedback from the r/stockmarket community. I know Reddit is brutally honest and honestly that's exactly what we are looking for. We are still working to improve the design and make the user experience even better.\n\nBullseye isn't anonymous like Reddit, but instead meant to specifically talk stocks with people you know so if r/stockmarket is interested in your own Reddit group - you would all be personally connected with your real names. \n\nBullseye is completely free, secure and private. It is only for iOS and we currently have sign in with Facebook and email. Bullseye is entirely bootstrapped - we are just three guys who are mobile product designers/retail investors trying to make a better stock app for everyone. \n\nPM me any questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "317ch6", "created_utc": 1427990188.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Looks sweet.

Since Bullseye is specifically built for staying up to date on the market whether that be the news, events, or conversation we can do a better job supplementing your conversation (compared to a normal chat app) to help you stay better informed.\n\nWe are currently just on iOS because 1) We are mobile product designers/devs so mobile is our strength 2) Conversations are mobile 3) We want to get it right first on iOS before we spend time on Android \n\nDefinitely look forward to your feedback after you have been able to use it for a week!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "But professional full time traders use Desktop not mobile.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That is true - a full time day trader likely has a multi-monitor setup.

Keep the app, sure, it's good when you leave the computer for a short period of time and still want to keep up for a conversation, but it's not good for a general day-to-day setting. \n\nMake a browser plugin or even just a website - something that lets me pull up a chat room in Chrome with my peers that provides supplemental information any time a stock is mentioned, provides a Chrome notification any time a stock in a certain list I specify is mentioned, provides a Chrome notification any time a preferred peer says something, integrates charts and news into the chat itself, notifies me in the chat of upcoming events related to a stock someone mentions, etc. Create mods as others have done for various trading platforms to integrate this system within the trading window itself. Have the  browser plugin overlay information on other sites like Twitter and StockTwits to display additional information when a stock is mentioned so that even if people prefer to use those platforms for communication, they'll still want your product to add further utility. Expand into a desktop app that combines all of this functionality into one instead of needing various mods, apps, plugins, websites, etc. - this even leaves room to expand into a full suite where you provide integration with brokers to execute orders while having a whole host of other features, like being able to execute trades directly from the chat window and all your other features that are integrated across the entire mobile and desktop experience.\n\nThat is going to be far more useful than continuously having to stop whatever I'm doing to check my phone for chats, stock news, having to read data on my phone, and trying to decide between a desktop platform or your app to provide various services I need.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "We know we won't get this correct right away and that we still need to define our product market fit.

We definitely want to play into your daily habits and not disrupt your workflow. \n\nOur current ambition is to make an excellent stock app first where it is then super easy to chat and discuss the market with people you know. You will always have a watchlist of stocks and we do bring in (hopefully) relevant news articles from Yahoo, MarketWatch, Bloomberg etc as well as company events like earnings for the stocks you're watching. \n\nWe're excited to see where the beta takes us!

I just think it's inevitable you will need to expand into a desktop setting eventually even if you're inherently mobile devs. For most people, they are trading on computers, so having to go to the phone takes away from their work. Plus it's just annoying to have to carry on a convo by phone when it's not necessary - I even have my text messages linked to Chrome so I can type on my PC when possible that way I can text even when my phone is half way across the room.\n\nThough you may definitely want to look into some integration with Robinhood (or other mobile apps like Stox) since that's a big thing with newbie investors and it may be cool for them to be able to automatically launch Robinhood from your app.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "As long as you take away any possibility of stock promotion / manipulation I think it could be fine.
