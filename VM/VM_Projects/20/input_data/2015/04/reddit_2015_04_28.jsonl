{"title": "Understanding BABA (insight from an American living in China...)", "selftext": "What is Alibaba? \n(only covering important platforms/services)\n\n**Chinese E-Commerce**\n\nAlibaba already dominates e-commerce in China (JD and Alibaba together have ~80% of online ecommerce). It's growth rate is directly correlated with the growth of Chinese consumerism. \n\nOnline commerce represents the main portion of the consumer economy. Brick and mortars lag far behind in total commerce. In the city I live in, Guangzhou (the third largest), you can visit any mall and see just a small percent of people actually go there to buy things. They go there to look at things and then go home and buy it on Taobao/Tmall/JD. Very different from US economy. I reckon a large % of brick and mortar commerce is wholesale buying. \n\n*Taobao* - Enterpreneurs / Small Retailers / Factory B2C\n\n*Tmall* - Online Flagship Stores (Apple, Nike, etc..)\n\n**Global E-Commerce**\n\n*Alibaba* - B2B           \n      \n*AliExpress* - B2C     \n\n**Cloud Computing**      \n      \n*AliYun* - more than 1.4 million customers and beginning international expansion. It's bigger than Amazon's AWS. \n        \n**Financial Unit**       \n     \n> Alibaba is entitled to a payment of at least $9.4 billion if Alipay or its parent hold an IPO. Alibaba also gets the perpetual right to 37.5 percent of the finance arm’s pretax earnings and can buy a stake of about one-third if regulators approve.      \n\n[This quote is from this article, which explains the structure in more detail.] (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-01-30/alibaba-finance-arm-said-to-plan-2016-initial-public-offering-i5je2vu0) This financial unit includes AliPay- A payment processor with 300 million users doing 80 million transactions DAILY. AliPay is already integrated with the financial unit's other services... Users can keep their money in the AliPay system and get interest payments DAILY (currently at 4%/yr)- so it's acting like a savings account and giving the financial unit some money to invest, loan, etc... There's a chance that their financial unit can take a big share from the major banks in China (especially regarding loans to small and medium sized businesses).       \n      \n**Notable Equity Stakes:** \n\n* 18.5% in Youku - it's China's Youtube (now transitioning to produce original content- huge upside here)\n* Lyft\n* Meizu - an up-and-coming smartphone maker in China\n* Snapchat \n* Sina - news portal and parent co. of Weibo (twitter/fb of China)\n* Haier - home electronics      \n       \n**Leadership**\n\nJack Ma is a visionary. If you have any doubt about this, I suggest you view all his speeches on Youtube to learn a bit more about the guy at the top. Trust that he will find the right opportunities to grow his e-commerce site (like expanding into India).      \n     \n**NOTE:**\n\nI'm probably missing some things... This is just a basic overview. I'm not a financial expert- just a marketing guy for a sex toy company =)\n\nI just figured I would write this out because you a lot of people on this sub are misunderstanding this company. It does not have the \"potential to be like Amazon\"- it already dominates Chinese e-commerce and has the potential to be an global e-commerce giant. It's also branching out and investing its cash. \n\n**Trading Advice:** \n      \nIf you're looking for a short term opportunity, then I have no advice for you. \n\nIf you're looking for a long term opportunity (5+ years), then this is one of the best options for you (if you want to expose yourself to the Chinese economy). Compare it to any other option you have on the US market and check for yourself. Is it worth 200 billion right now? Not sure- but their growth rate is impressive (and I trust it will continue to grow) and their margins are fantastic. They will have a lot of money to play with and I trust the leadership to make money for its shareholders.

I should have also touched on the lack of retail infrastructure- especially in rural places. There are no Walmarts or Best Buy equivalents in small cities (we’re talking 2~5 million people!) at least in terms of price-to-convenience ratios. And if there are big box stores, the range of goods is very limited.\n\nAlso, big box stores here almost NEVER have better prices, while in the states you have good retail options (target, dollar general, macys, etc can sometimes compete with online retailers). The convenience factor also weighs in America~ just drive and buy now. Here, I even buy things like paper towels and bottled water online~ I would never do that in America! \n\nAmazon is so successful because they ship fast. Ecommerce is so successful here because buyers have few retail choices and shipping infrastructure is good. It’s also a pain in the ass getting anywhere (too many people, lack of infrastructure, major trek to get to the right store that has the item you want, etc.) In major cities you can order something in the morning and get it in the evening via JingDong.... Most taobao sellers will have the goods to you in less than three days at a cost of about $1.50usd. \n\nAs Jack Ma likes to say... In America ecommerce is the dessert.
