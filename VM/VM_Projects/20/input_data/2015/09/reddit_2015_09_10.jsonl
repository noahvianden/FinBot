{"title": "Finally time for BABA?", "selftext": "Hi all. When BABA IPO'd I had a hunch the world's largest IPO was going be a utter failure when I compared it to AMZN. After an IPO priced at $68 and nearly doubling to $120 months following and now we're at $64 well below the IPO price. At current valuation BABA is worth $157B well below AMZN's ~$250B market cap. My question for /r/ stocks is do you guys think BABA is just Enron waiting to be or is BABA truly the Amazon of the East as we often hear it called? On a side note I do question the credibility of the wares that Alibaba sells(as far as knock offs) as well as the fact they're a Chinese company in a struggling Chinese economy.

BABA is a growth stock, if and only if China's growth continues. If China is unable to prop up their economy and stock market, BABA goes down with it. The fact that $64 is less than $68, means nothing without considering that China's growth is falling from 7.4% in 2014 to perhaps 6.5% in 2016 (and the real growth rate is suspected by some to be even lower).", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "$BABA this is not falling any further!
