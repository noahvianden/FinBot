{"title": "I shorted a stock that went up 12,000% in one day", "selftext": "This was a few months ago but the trade is still open.  \n\nBack in May an article came out that Tesla was buying a company called Riviera Tool. The stock RIVT went up from 0.005/sh to as much as around 0.60 per share - 12,000% gain.  I knew there was no chance acquisitions of public companies could happen at such multiples of the share price so I immediately started digging into the stock history.  My first thought was it was the wrong ticker symbol, somewhat like when Twitter was about to go public and the bankrupt company Tweeter's stock soared.\n\nThis turned out to be pretty much the same case here.  The company was correct, but the ticker was no longer affiliated with the company.  I found old stories from around 7 years prior showing that Riviera Tool went bankrupt and the assets were sold to a new private company.  All that happened was no one had gotten around to filing the paperwork to formally delist the stock and so it kept trading for years even though it no longer represented anything.\n\nI first heard about the stock around 1pm that day and had things pretty much figured out within 15 minutes.  By then the price had dropped from 60 cents to 25 cents, but I knew it was actually worthless so I tried to short the stock.  I found shares available to be shorted on Interactive Brokers and shorted 10k shares for $0.25 each.  This was a relatively small trade, but I wanted to be somewhat careful as I knew it was always possible the stock could continue to explode higher for quite a while thanks to clueless traders and bandwagon jumpers.  Afterall I'd recently seen promotion stocks like LOTE and CYNK get billion dollar valuations despite having no assets, revenue, or even employees.  As it happens the stock just continued down pretty slowly over the next few hours and closed at .225.  Here is where it gets weird though.\n\nAt about 4:30pm an alert comes across that FINRA has halted the stock.  I pretty much declared victory at that moment because I knew the stock was worthless and FINRA would figure that out too and either cancel the shares or at least halt it for long enough for the dust to settle and let it reopen at .005 again.  However, that was May 7th and the stock is still halted.  It seems like a pretty cut and dry case so I have no idea what is taking them so long to take action.  Also, I've been paying borrow fees each and every day since.  Currently it's costing me about $4 a day to hold the position, but the rate fluctuates and it's been as much as double that some days.  Why the rate changes at all when no one can enter or close the position is a mystery to me, but it's a slow bleeding that has eroded much of the profit from the trade.  Even if it reopens at zero tomorrow I'll have paid about 1/3rd of the net proceeds in borrow fees, and if it stays halted for another 8 months or so I'll actually lose money on it even if it goes to zero.  \n\nTLDR: Shorted a stock up 12,000% in a day.  It went to effectively zero three hours later.  I'm probably still going to lose money on it.
