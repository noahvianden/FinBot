{"title": "VRX - Valeant Pharmaceuticals DD - Bull Case", "selftext": "Alright you idiots time to listen up. We're going to take a look into Valeant Pharmaceuticals, a yolo worthy bio pharm. You may be familiar with Valeant for a number of reasons including but not exclusive to: Bill Ackman, Bernie Sanders accusing them of price gouging, Citron Research's report that sent VRX tumbling, or their shady business practices on blast in the media (Philidor).\n\nIf you've been paying any attention to this story you should know about Philidor, the specialty pharmaceutical company that was engaging in shady business practices with Valeant. They operated as two separate businesses, however Valeant owned options to buy Philidor at a 0 Strike. Valeant claimed they did not own Philidor, and in the technical definition they didn't, but if you can convert at a 0 strike you have no cost of capital, you own the fuckin company. Philidor had other sketchy practices, they were known for acquiring drugs and marking up their prices. Much like Martin Shkreli - CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals who was in the public recently for the same thing. He had an interesting [AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3q38qg/iama_martin_shkreli_ceo_of_turing_pharmaceuticals/) where he briefly defended Valeant's business model.  \n\nOn 11/10 VRX hosted a call to inform us of details on how they plan to sever their relationship with Philidor. Although this will be a loss in revenue, it's important to note that Philidor only contributed $190mn or 6.8% of VRX's 3Q revnue of $2.8bn. Philidor was one of many revenue source for VRX. Let's look at some more numbers; Revenue in 2012, '13, and '14 increased 44.0, 62.7, 43.2% respectively. Factoring in Philidor, analysts anticipate VRX's revenue to increase 20.9% in 2015. \n\nEven with the loss of Philidor, Valeant will continue to see a strong rise in EPS projected 30.1% yoy growth for 2015 and 20.6% for 2016. Valeant has been beaten up recently and fundamentally offers a very attractive opportunity. Just remember, this is still a yolo, there is a chance this whole thing goes down in flames. Valeant other lines of business could also be acting sketchy, leading to further problems. There's also a chance politicians pursue regulation prohibiting drug companies from marking up prices at their digression. God damn socialist politicians messing with the free market.\n\nI think things will shake out alright for VRX and they'll recovery from their current highly discounted valuation. That's why I went long this past week. That being said, its going to be a volatile ride, so make sure to strap in the roller coaster. Patient will be key with this trade.  \n\n\nHow would you play VRX, even as a paper trade? Finally, I will provide sources for my data if you PM me. \n\n**Disclaimers:**\n\n1)These are my opinions and they should not be used solely to make investment decisions. Please do your own research and DD, that way you can formulate your own decision. \n\n2)I am long VRX.

They could very well manage to pay the ''fines'' (if any), pay their debts, and manage to keep growing even if the governement is quietly bitching and moaning about their business model and then be considered a ''good'' company again leaving all this drama behind, to say that this was just a small *blip* in VRX's history.
