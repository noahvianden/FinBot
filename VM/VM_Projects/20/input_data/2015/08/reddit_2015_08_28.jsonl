{"title": "What Im trading today", "selftext": "I am focusing on two tickers today, possibly three.\n\nPCLN \n\nNFLX \n\nTSLA\n\n\nMy plan is to see if we fade at open to that level from yesterday where we faded, only to be bought back before the bell.  Also keep an eye on 197.50 on SPY from premkt levels as well.\n\nIf we fade down there, I will be looking to get long on a rebound.  \nNFLX 118 calls (expiring today)  \n\nPCLN 1240 calls (expiring today, dont need a lot, and they are $$)\n\nTSLA 240 calls (expiring today)\n\n\nIf we dont catch that rebound, I will reevaluate my plan. If that level from yesterday doesnt hold, look for weds close to be next, if thats the case, I will be getting some puts for a very quick ride.\n\n\nedit:   netted $4531 so far today.  All cash right now.   Traded PCLN 1250 calls,  5 from $8.40 and 5 from $5.   Sold them at various prices once we popped over 1260   $3590 on PCLN.   PLayed TSLA 245 calls at the open, and again some 250 calls after i sold the 245s.  $2335 on TSLA   Played NFLX 108 calls but got had on those.  wasnt going to take out 119 for us and the prices were all whacked out.  I could have made some on those, but I pussed out and sold half on that first dip,  1.58 to .96 on 15 so i ate my ass there.  it came back up, but not enough to cover the loss.  ended up selling the remaing 15 at 1.45 and 1.40   -$1394 on NFLX ", "id": "3iq0je", "created_utc": 1440767353.0, "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "China guy coming to talk to US Gov about 23B buyout.

{"title": "EGO and trading.", "selftext": "I've been doing this for about 2.5 years now. Some of you might remember my post earlier this week about doubling my one account on some SPY puts I bought before the crash. The problem is, when you hit a big trade like this you start to tell yourself subconsciously that you are a fucking awesome trader and have the market figured out. Hence, yesterday, I am driving my daughter to the dentist and checking the market on my phone like a responsible parent. I see it tanking in the afternoon and just blindly buy 10 SPY 190 puts for 3.50. Repeat of earlier in the week, OBVIOUSLY! So I gamble more, cause why not? I am up so much now and worst case is I lose a couple hundred of my profit from the week. No stop loss needed motherfucker, this thing is gonna crash again. EGO. So I decide to stop swerving all over the road checking the market and get to the waiting room at the dentist. Whats this? Spy is now back to day highs? Fucking motherfucker. I sell my puts for 2.50 in a panic. BAM! $1000 loss just like that in a half hour. Still up a grand on the week but man that hurts. This market will humble you. It will do the opposite of what you expect. It will test you. I learn these lessons daily but seem to forget them fucking quick. Trade small.
