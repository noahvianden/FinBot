With that amount at that age I would go for a stable company with a business model you like and plan to hold for several years. I went with about that amount into Netflix when they started streaming. Now I am evaluating if I want to stay with them or redistribute some shares into a less risky stock.  I took risk being young and lost 80% of my investment  in the first year or two. I held long term with a positive outlook on the company and am now up like 250% or something stupid. My other small position in brk-b is up about 80% as well. If I had been inpatient, I would have lost all my money and missed out on an excellent opportunity. I still don't know what I am doing, but I am glad that I never read discouraging advice when I was starting out. Keep in mind, everything is percentage gains. If you go with a risky company and go up 20% and then down 45%, it's not going to be fun, and you will have buyers remorse for buying too high or feeling like you did something wrong. I'd try to pick a few companies you have good faith in, research them and then buy for the long haul. If they do well, you will find yourself paying more attention to them as you get older. Keep an eye on overall indexes, sometimes your company is doinf fine but all the stocks are going down. I will also suggest to look at defense companies ie: Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop gruman. I'd like to add positions to all 3 in the near future when I have more funds available. Also brk-b, is a really safe option in my opinion to beat out an index fund on a year to year basis. Good luck. Just wanted to throw some encouragement to another $1000 starter like myself. $1000 won't make you rich but it could very easily be the catalyst to get you involved in the market and making smart investments for your future. If you play it somewhat responsibly, you should see much better returns than a ban account. If you play very risky you might lose it all. One last word of advice, if start with dowj Nasdaq and snp500 stocks. No need to start with a bb or otc stock, until you know what you are doing. $1000 investment is $1000 and you can only gain a percentage of that to start. If you decide to learn more, you may try to play options to take larger risks and in some cases hedge a large risk. I would certainly recommend a buy and hold strategy to start, if you feel like one stock pick is a mistake, you can always set a limit to make sure you would only lose x % to start.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Biotech/health care mutual fund", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "TD Ameritrade.
