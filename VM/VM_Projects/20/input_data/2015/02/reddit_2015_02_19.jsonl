{"title": "Very noob stock question.", "selftext": "Okay, I've been recently thinking about getting into the stock market as a hobby. I've been thinking about purchasing stock in Tesla Motors. However, there is something that doesn't really make sense to me at the moment. \n\nThe idea I have (the idea that many others have when getting Tesla stock) is that Tesla is more of a long term investment and it would be best to just purchase the stock and forget about it until Tesla motors has taken over the entire world lol. \n\nAnyway, what I don't understand is why the price of Tesla stock is currently at $211 when they are a relatively small and niche company. At the moment Microsoft stock is at $43 a share and they have already conquered the world several times over in a way of speaking. \n\nI don't understand is why Microsoft's stock value is so low compared to Tesla Motors'. Also, how much more could Tesla's stock actually increase if the company does overtake the market eventually?\n\nThere is something fundamental about the stock market that I obviously don't understand.

Basically, sometimes companies decide that their share price is uncomfortably high, so that us non-rich peasants can't really afford too many shares.  So they split their stock, effectively taking each share and splitting it into two or more shares.  So if you were to look at the history of MSFT, their stock has been split 9 times, each time increasing the number of shares while cutting down the price of each share.\n\nThen there's stocks like Berkshire Hathway A (BRK/A), where someone clearly went \"screw you poor people\", and let their share price climb all the way to 221,495.00 without any splits (I'm not kidding, that's the current BRK/A price per share).  Most of us wouldn't even be able to afford a single share of that.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "When a company decides to split its stock so more people can purchase it does that hurt those who already purchased stock when it was at a higher rate and there was less of them?

You will then have two shares which will roughly trade with half the value before the split each.\n\nYou can not say anything about a company by looking at the share price, share price is the price of the entire company (market cap) divided by the amount of shares outstanding.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Okay, that's clear to me now.

Basic economics.  Think to yourself, \"if stock kept appearing out of thin air, what would that do to the price?\" Well...that would lower the price, because there is more supply.
