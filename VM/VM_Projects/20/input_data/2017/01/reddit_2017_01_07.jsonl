{"title": "The r/StockMarket Weekly Stock Picking Challenge for the Week of (1/9-1/13) is now OPEN for picks! ***RATIONALE REQUIRED!!***", "selftext": "# Welcome to the r/StockMarket Weekly Stock Picking Challenge for the Week of (1/9-1/13)\n\n**PLEASE READ THESE RULES THOROUGHLY BEFORE POSTING UP YOUR STOCK PICKS!**\n\n*****\n\n**If you want to be eligible to participate in this week's challenge here is what you need to do (REQUIRED!):**\n> * 1.) Post 2 tickers (ex. AAPL = Apple) but **YOU MUST** pick 2 not just 1 or else I will not add you to our list of contestants!\n> * 2.) Choose either Long or Short for each ticker (Obviously LONG - if you think it will go up ... or SHORT - if you think it will go down this week...)\n> * 3.) Both of your picks **MUST** each be at least $2 at the very minimum! If you pick something that is under $2 then you pick will not count, and you will not be entered into this week's challenge!\n\n*****\n\n**Challenge Rules (PLEASE READ THESE AND FOLLOW THEM!)**:\n> * 1.) No OTC, ADRs, or Foreign companies.\n> * 2.) No Options, Futures, Forex, stuff like that... Equities ONLY that trade on the U.S. Stock Exchange!\n> * 3.) If you don't post both the ticker AND the direction (LONG/SHORT) you won't be added to the list of contestants for this week's stock picking challenge!\n> * 4.) You cannot duplicate someone's exact play! For example- If someone picks AAPL - Long and BAC - Long first then you can only pick AAPL - Short and BAC - Long or AAPL - Long and BAC - Short *<-- you may only duplicate 1 pick but not BOTH!* This is a first come, first serve basis here.\n> * 5.) Picks absolutely **MUST** be posted in here before the 9:30AM eastern cash market open on Monday morning!\n> * 6.) You are only allowed 1 leveraged ETF. If you choose two, the second of the two does not count and is still up for grabs. If incorrect picks go un-noticed, you risk your position being forfeited! (These are the 2x/3x ETF's)\n> * 7.) RATIONALE - You **MUST** post up a rationale (either technical or fundamental) for both of your picks or you will **NOT** be entered into this week's challenge!\n> * 8.) Please **DO NOT EDIT** your picks!! If you absolutely must choose another pick, please use a separate post and state that you are changing your original pick to something else!\n> * 9.) You may choose to close out one or both of your picks at any time during the trading week. **PLEASE POST YOUR OWN CLOSING PRICE(S)!** We will be using the intraday 1 minute closing price using the time stamp of your post here on r/StockMarket for when you closed out your pick. You need to state which pick(s) you are closing out as well as the price when you closed it out. I will be confirming that your closing price is indeed correct by looking up the 1 min intraday chart. If it is not correct, I will then post up and input the correct price into the live spreadsheet.\n\n*****\n\nI will post up the live challenge spreadsheet a little after the market closes on Monday with everyone's posted picks, this will include your opening prices, current prices, P&L, & ROI for each of your picks, as well as an overall total ROI and an overall average ROI between 2 of your picks, and that will be what we will use to total up both of your 2 picks!\n\nEveryone's picks will start at Monday's opening prices.\n\nGood luck to everyone in here! Let's see who can deliver the 2 best picks for this week and take bragging rights as the best stock picker of the week here at r/StockMarket! :P\n\nIf you have any questions about anything feel free to fire away on this thread...\n\nHope to see another pretty nice show of participation in here on this second trading week of 2017 at r/StockMarket! :)\n\nAgain please try to get those 2 picks in before the 9:30am eastern cash market open on Monday! Ready, set, GO!!!\n\nHave fun all and GLTA in this upcoming trading week ahead! :)", "id": "5mhuwn", "created_utc": 1483754870.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Long X - Trump gonna say wall stuff to make it go up.\n\nLong NVDA - People are some being scared of it.
