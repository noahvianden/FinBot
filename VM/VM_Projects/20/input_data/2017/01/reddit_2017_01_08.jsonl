NVDA's IV rank (68) is high right now. You might be better off waiting until right before their earnings call in February though. I would also think about moving your call strike further OTM. Analysts are still bullish and most price targets are well above 100.

FWIW I'd say you have the right idea. If you don't want to actively monitor your positions, selling volatility is the way to go. I prefer to use directionality and sell verticals, which generally give higher ROI, but that would be pretty difficult with a 1-year timeframe on NVDA.
