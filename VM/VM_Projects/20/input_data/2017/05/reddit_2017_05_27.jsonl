My questions is, why is a deep ITM Call used for the long leg? Instead, I could buy an ATM Call, for a smaller debit, reducing my risk?\nExample with AAPL:\nBuy 1 155 Call Jan19 for 18\nSell 1 155 Call 02Jun17 for 0.54", "id": "6dn1qi", "created_utc": 1495881523.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "To make it profitable and to mimic more like a stock position / covered call you need the deeper ITM long option.

If you buy a 50 delta (ATM) option, that has the highest extrinsic value so even though you are paying \"less\" for the option --  you're actually paying the most extrinsic that will be impacted by IV (vega) and time decay (theta).  So that is why 70 delta options comes in for long leg as the rule of thumb...\n\nTo get the bang for the buck (and assuming you are right on direction), you get the most bang for the buck by buying the 70 delta and selling the 30 delta.\n\nEdit: Example...\nIf you pay $1 for a 70 delta option, it may have $0.20 of extrinsic value so let's say on expiration day, it will still be worth $0.80 if the underlying does not change (all things being equal).  If you pay $0.60 for a 50 delta option, it may have $0.35 of extrinsic so at the end it will decay down to $0.25.  Basically, if you pay a bit more for the higher delta option, you're exposing yourself to less decay as the intrinsic option will hold value regardless of IV / time.  You need that function of the option (hold its value) so you can keep selling 30 delta options that hopefully decay to $0 and you keep you intrinsic intact through your 70 delta option (even if the underlying doesn't move -- there is enough intrinsic that may make the strategy profitable as you keep selling 30 delta short against it).", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much!
