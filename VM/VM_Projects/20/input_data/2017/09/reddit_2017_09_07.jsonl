", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The counterargument is that IV exceeds HV because of long tail risk and the way that HV is calculated does not account for short instances of very high volatility. Large traders are afraid of being wiped out from a big move, so they are willing to pay so that someone else gets wiped out. Selling options makes you that person, and so you will be wiped out instead. Only you can decide if that premium is worth it and recently premium has been super low which is very nice for big traders buying puts as protection.\n\nThe studies that show that selling IV is profitable do not include many instances of the long tail risk in their data sets, because, well, they are rare, so it is expected they will show this type of trade as profitable. But long tail events can, do, and will take place, whether your backtest study has any or not, and you will get wiped out.\n\nTastyTrade themselves observe that the annualized edge from selling IV is only around 1-2%, which is based on backtests over a period of time where the index was mostly slowly rising during the longest bull market in history, thus was _the best possible market for doing so_. It also just so happens to be around the expected level of inflation, thus in real dollar terms there is no edge just from selling IV.\n\nMany options sellers mitigate this tail risk by purchasing further out of the money options, which is an effective way of doing so. However, by purchasing a further OTM option, you are paying exactly the same tail risk protection that you originally sold, which eliminates the edge. To make matters worse, options pricing theory treats implied volatility and the market price as interchangeable (because other inputs are relatively fixed), and implied volatility rises as you get further and further out of the money, so by purchasing a further OTM option, you are actually paying _more_ of a premium than than you captured by selling it.\n\nTL:DR; The backtest studies that conclude that selling IV is more profitable than buying a) don't exceed inflation, b) don't include the tail risk events that people are buying options specifically to mitigate and c) don't address the effect of defining risk on the net IV of the spread.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Agreed, you cannot afford to inventory volatility as it's mean reverting.\n\nSearch tastytrade.com market measures for one of their VIX videos -- they explain all of this in great detail.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Trading volatility?

Your best bet following this route would be to do straddles ~30 days out, as that is more or less where the VIX is in terms of its forward-looking nature. \n\nAlternatively, learn to trade VIX as the separate instrument it is(n't), and learn the /VX Futures structure and curve.

Thus, if there is a reversal, I will not gain as much as if the same move had happened while I was still ATM. The VIX as I understand it does not work like this. A 1% down move in the SPY will cause the VIX to rise the same amount no matter how far it went up in the previous few days.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nOne way of answering this question might be \"yes, you can do that, but the cost of carry basically acts the same as the decreasing gamma by directly eating away at your position so if/when the spike happens you will not have as much in the position to gain from it\". That would be an unsatisfying answer, but an answer.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Don't overthink it. Gamma doesn't eat away at your position.

Right now (well less so than before), we are in a low VIX environment relative to long term average.\n\nThe real factor to getting long volatility is always going to be the futures structure, which in most market conditions means a prohibitive cost of carry. \"implied\" volatility is always forward-looking. You can \"trade the curve\" of /VX futures if you have the capital/risk appetite to beat the cost of carry, but every vol etf, SPY option, etc. has it already baked in. \n\nTo that point, only a bit ago it was about as cheap as it gets to get long vol, and it's still pretty cheap if you want to get in now.
