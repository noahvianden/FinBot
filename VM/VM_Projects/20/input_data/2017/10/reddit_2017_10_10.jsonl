{"title": "How do option chains price bi-modal (binary event) expectations?", "selftext": "*EDIT*: The consensus here seems to be that the IV smile _will_ turn into a frown if we get close enough to an especially high IV earnings event. I'm not sure that definitely answers the question, but I'll commit to updating this over the next few days as we approach NFLX earnings because I am curious as well. :-)\n\nImplied volatility often (always?) rises as the strike price moves away from the current underlying price because the basis of options pricing models assumes that returns are normally (or lognormally, or whatever distribution with a mean and standard deviation you want) distributed around the current price. Delta (or dual delta) is an indication of the probability that an option will be ITM at expiration, and it too often (always?) declines are you move away from the current price. In normal market environments this works.\n\nBut there are binary events (earnings announcements, drug trials) in which the market may be split on the _direction_, but not on the _fact_ that the underlying will make a substantial move after the event (say +/- 5% as an example).\n\nTypically this results in an increase in implied volatility leading up to the event, which is reasonable, since a higher than usual movement is expected in a short period of time. But the _shape_ of the IV smile, or the way that delta works, does not change. Even though the market expects a +/-5% move, delta still implies that the probability of those +/-5% strikes is lower than the current price, which is clearly wrong.\n\nBut wouldn't that imply the ATM options are enormously overpriced if a substantial move is expected, since whatever that price is, it is overestimating the probability of ATM options being ITM? Isn't that a huge, easily captured arbitrage opportunity for a simple strategy that sells ATM options before a large binary event?\n\nHelp me poke holes in this.\n\nMaybe the market makers will widen the spreads so that even though it appears to be a normal pricing structure if you look at the midpoints (which we do), when you look at the prices that trades actually execute at, they will resemble the appropriate chances of it happening? But for that to be the case, the ATM spread would have to be wider than the +/-5% spreads, which seems unlikely?\n\nPerhaps it has something to do with having to sell both sides, so that gains on one side are offset by declines in the other? But again, put call parity is at work with ATM options, so both are still overpriced, and both are arb opportunities if one is?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "75iwil", "created_utc": 1507658783.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I agree that the IV smile is not accurate in binary events, but have you ever seen an IV curve make a frown?
