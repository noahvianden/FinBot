The best advice I can give you is don’t listen to anybody’s opinion. These big banks will put out a statement to move the market then do something else entirely. When analyzing and trying to determine outcomes of situations like this, always ask the question, “why”  and when you find the answer to that question ask “why” again and again until you can’t anymore and you fully understand the situation and can determine your own opinion of what will happen. \n\n\n", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}
