{"title": "Carvana DD (CVNA)", "selftext": "Tried to post this on Monday, but apparently no one saw it...missed out on some gainz for 'yall unfortunately.\n\n[**Carvana**](https://www.carvana.com/) – Carvana is an online retailer for used cars.  They purchase vehicles, perform a 150-point inspection, take 360-degree photos of the car inside and out, and then list it for sale on their website.  Carvana’s website is quite impressive.  You are able to narrow down exactly what features you want in the car and you know they will be accurate because all cars have gone through the same process.  For example, if you are like me and have a hot butt, you’ll want to search for whips with that sweet sweet ventilated seating.  Try to do that accurately on another used car website!  Carvana earns revenue from selling used cars as well as providing financing.  They will allow you to pick up the car from one of their “vending machines” or they will deliver it right to your door.  Once delivered, you may drive the car for up to 7 days and return it with no questions asked if you don’t like it.\n\n[**TrueCar**](https://www.truecar.com/#/) – TrueCar assists both New and Used car buyers by providing their customers with information related to what others have paid for a similar vehicle.  They basically arm you with price knowledge when going to purchase a vehicle.  TrueCar earns revenue through dealer-paid fees when TrueCar assists on a sale.\n\nIn my opinion, while TrueCar is helpful, I think that the internet already forces used car dealers to price their cars competitively in order to drive people in the door.  Also, TrueCar runs the risk of the industry moving away from dealers much like Tesla has shunned the traditional sales model.\n\nCarvana represents a real opportunity to take the used car sales industry into the new world.  In 2015, Edmunds.com estimated the used car market to generate $715 b in annual sales.  With 2016 revenue of $130.4mm, Carvana represents only a 0.02% market share.  Carvana’s biggest hurdle right now appears to be their low inventory and limited locations, although in their [S1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690820/000119312517141291/d297157ds1a.htm) they admit to purposely keeping inventory levels low in order to decrease their avg. days to sale and therefore increase their gross profit on each vehicle.  They are currently in 21 major metropolitan cities.  They started in Atlanta and then expanded into Nashville (with a car vending machine) to prove their concept.  Carvana currently has vending machines in Nashville, Houston, San Antonio, & Austin.\n\nBut what about autonomous vehicles!?  Yes, much like the smart phone and digital media, I do think all cars will be autonomous in the future, and maybe people won’t need to own a car at all – instead choosing to ride-share everywhere.  (less cars on the road = cleaner planet, less traffic, less deaths / accidents) OMG can that NVDA boner get any more hard?  But that is going to take a long time to catch on.  In the meantime, let’s ride CVNA into orbit!\n\n[**CVNA / TRUE Revenue Snapshot**](http://imgur.com/a/AfIH3)\n\nAs you can see in the graph above, Carvana has an aggressive revenue growth compared to TrueCar, in fact, I’m going to stop talking about TrueCar all-together now.  \n\nThey are only in a 21 cities at the moment! 21!  As Carvana expands into new markets, their previous experiences help them do so quicker and cheaper.  CVNA is only 1% penetrated in the Atlanta and Nashville markets.  No other market is above 0.5% penetrated (lol).  Additionally, as their brand continues to grow, so will their user base and demand for more markets.  As you can see in the table, they are increasing their Revenue / Market % each year.  CVNA opened 2 new markets in 1Q 2017.\n\n**Debt**:\n\nFloorplan Loan: Carvana has a $200mm floorplan loan to purchase used vehicles with.  They currently have an outstanding balance of $189.7mm.  They will need significant more capacity in order to continue expanding their operations.\nNote Payable: As of 03-31-17, Carvana had $6.8mm in NP which is used to acquire haulers and equipment used in their logistics.  This is a 5-year term.\n\n**The Play**:\n\nIf you are interested in playing CVNA, I’d recommend selling a cash secured put at a strike price you won’t feel guilty about.  The stock has been on FIRE lately (why did no one mention this thing during their IPO?), but I don’t really know how to value shit so don’t ask me what price I think it should be / has the potential to be, I just know something good when I see it!\n\n[My Position]( http://imgur.com/a/TDP8Q)\n[1Q’17]( https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690820/000169082017000007/carvana3311710q.htm) \n\n**What I’m Seeing**:\n\nCVNA opened 2 more markets in the first quarter of 2017.  Even though their Gross Profit / Sales increased from FYE16’s 5% to 6%, CVNA posted a large loss of ($45.7mm) or -29% vs. FYE 16’s -4%.  The cause for the loss isn’t easily identifiable on their income statement, especially when their SG&A / Revenue % improved from 30% at FYE 16 to 29% at 1Q17, but when we look at their Revenue / # of Markets, we see a large decrease from $17.4mm at FYE 16 to only $6.9mm in 1Q17.  Carvana stated multiple times that they were able to expand into new markets more efficiently, so we would assume this number will recover as the year goes on.  \n\n[**Large Amounts of Used Vehicles to Enter the Market**]( http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/automotive/sc-off-lease-used-cars-autocover-0309-story.html)\n\nLarge amounts of used vehicles will be entering the marketplace over the next several years.  This will reduce the prices of used cars and put pressure on Carvana’s margins, but ultimately it should bring them more customers.  Hopefully management navigates this challenge / opportunity successfully.\n", "id": "6ixf0d", "created_utc": 1498174385.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 16, "comments": [{"body": "Bitch we know, CVNA is a new meme stock candidate ", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "I tried to post this earlier but the mods were suppressing my DD for memes and shitposts :(", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Carvana is a joke of a company run by douchebags in shorts and loafers and they are crapping many many millions of dollars in losses.
