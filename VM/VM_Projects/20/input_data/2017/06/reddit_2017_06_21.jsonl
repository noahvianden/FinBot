{"title": "Amazon vs Everyone - Some common item pricing comparisons.", "selftext": "Why I believe Amazon's recent acquisition of Whole Foods is a big Threat to anyone who sells groceries. \n\nCompetitive Pricing: Amazon can absolutely complete on pricing with Target, Kroger, Safeway, Walmart. Lets take a look at some stable items. Just did a google search on most purchased grocery Items in America and pick a few common staples.\n\nSoda: Coca-Cola Fridge Pack Cans, 12 Count - 12 fl oz\n>Vons.com = $7.19\n>Amazon = $5.13\n>Walmart = $21.00 - All their 12packs where listed at this price. (makes no sense to me)\n>Costco = No branded soda options listed online.\n>Target = In store only purchase.\n\nBread:Oroweat Bread 100% Whole Wheat - 24 Oz\n>Vons.com = $3.99\n>Amazon.com = $3.49\n>Walmart.com = In store Only purchase.\n>Costco.com = No bread options listed online.\n>Target = In store only purchase.\n\nMilk 1gal whole:\n>Vons.com = $4.49\n>Amazon.com = $3.49\n>Walmart.com = In store Only purchase.\n>Costco.com = No bread options listed online.\n>Target = In store only purchase.\n\nVelveeta Shells & Cheese Dinner, 12 oz:\n>Vons.com = $3.49\n>Amazon.com = $2.48\n>Walmart = $2.48\n>Costco.com = No Velveeta options listed online.\n>Target.com = $2.59\n\nAmazon basically beat everyone on price, and all orders for Amazon fresh over $40 are free shipping. The order had the option for next day delivery including the milk. \n\nOk but Costco sells items in bulk so its not a fair comparison. So lets look at some bulk Item comparison from Costco.com and Amazon.com\n\nSoda Coke, 12 oz, 35 ct:\n>>Costco: $14.54 Delivered\n>>Amazon : $15.99 Delivered with total purchase over $40\n\nStarbucks Pike Place Coffee, Medium, Keurig K-Cups, 60 ct \n>>Costco: $36.79 \n>>Amazon : $54.00\n\nCigarettes: Marlboro Kings, Box\n>>Costco: $73.80 \n>>Amazon: Does not sell. \n\nCostco does a great job on securing best prices for specific items that are temporary so they cant be beat on direct item comparison. So any TV, Appliance, furniture are basically buy it now at this price or it may never be seen again in this store. I think this is a nice strategic advantage for cost saving to Costco Members but also provides limited options. You may not find the specific 4K TV or item that you are looking for. Amazon will have a much higher chance of providing you a specific brand with specs a customer may want. \n\nCostco also sells a lot of items to small businesses and there is no practical way for me to compare items like offices supplied given the wide range of items purchased. Also I'm to lazy to want to do that. Overall I do think that Costco provides a very specific service to their members that other retailers do not do. They will allow item returns for ever, they will have the best pricing on items in their stores, and they have lots of new items often. \n\nThe draw backs to Costco are crowded stores, long lines, limited hours, limited selections, lots of temporary items.\n\nI do believe Amazon will compete with costco easily on items that are commonly delivered and will begin to make grocery items commonly delivered, though Whole food store distribution as this helps them close \"the last mile\" delivery issue for frozen and fresh groceries. \n\nImagine every week a fresh loaf of bread, carton of eggs, gallon of milk, ice cream, cereal, frozen dinners, soda and other desired items being delivered to your home or apartment with automatic re-orders at very competitive pricing and free shipping. You can set other items to show up bi weekly or monthly such as toilet paper, toothpaste, cleaning supplied and other basic staples. Amazon also accepts EBT cards as well for those on Government assistance. \n\nThe Grocery chains, Target, and Walmart are in more danger of losing market share then Costco to Amazon. Whole foods Allows Amazon to start selling all grocery items previously not available do to the Last mile distance problem but Whole Foods 400 stores in populated cities helps solve this problem. They will have the physical assets of distribution, logistics, and staff already knowledgeable to expand into the growing grocery delivery market. \n\nJust my two cents. I don't have a position in any of these companies, Nvidia to the Moon!\n\nEdited wording. \n\n\n", "id": "6ij801", "created_utc": 1498015592.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Long term, I agree.

Costco makes the majority of their profit from the memberships.
