Deliveries take less than 1 minute in average. So if you can't wait a second for then to make their delivery you have patience issues. Big ass trucks are not easy to drive. People constantly ride your ass, cut around you when your stopped not realizing the truck makes wide turns. Also visibility is terrible not to mention they are very high so you have to watch for signs, wires etc. A lot of times two spots are required to park so people don't park you in and you can get on with your job. If you ask me, society has no regards for delivery drivers because they view them as dumb blue collar workers. more than half the drivers I work with are college educated, myself included.

It is likely that Amazon is placing unreasonable demands on the drives and holding them to them under the risk of losing the work. The drivers are basically choosing to inconvenience you over losing their jobs. You should be pissed an Amazon for inventing 1-hour deliver or whatever madness they are up to because this is the cost of that service.\n\nI am not saying you should tolerate drivers stealing your spaces. But if you are going to make a stink about it, you should make a stink on the Amazon level not the driver level.
