{"title": "Help me understand what's happening today...", "selftext": "Hey guys, thought I'd pick our collective brain and see if I can get some advice etc.\n\nYTD I have been watching the market rally 10+% since the beginning of the year on this Trump confidence wave thing. So I've been running positive deltas a bit, as opposed to neutral or negative deltas like a good premium seller should. Hey why not, I wanna participate in the crash up too.\n\nSo Tuesday was a big down day (relatively) and my beta-weighted portfolio went from about +10 delta to about +30 delta, without a significant draw down in liquidation amount. I think I was down maybe 25 bucks on the day, which for a big move and uptick in vol against me, was not so bad. \n\nYesterday I decided I wanted to get much more even delta-wise, so I sold some call spreads on a few highly correlated-to-SPY underlyings, like financials that got a bit beat up, etc. I saw that VIX went up about 1.5 or so, I'm sitting on mostly cash and thought I'd take the opportunity to get a bit more delta neutral and extrinsic premium out there. \n\nAll of my outstanding positions are between 30 and 45 DTE.\n\nNo new trades today, and not a lot of market movement today either (well I just checked, SPY +0.75, IWM +1.25). I'm still positive delta even after my adjustments yesterday - went from about +30 beta weighted deltas to about +5 bw deltas. \n\nSo why am i feeling this big draw down today?? well it isn't big according to TW it's -16.5%,  I will gladly accept being told I'm watching it too closely and to just let things sit and work for me, but it sucks to watch 10% of my capital go away on a day where the market is supposedly moving in my slight favor. \n\nVix is down slightly for the day, so my short vega positions shouldn't be feeling a major hit, and all my short options are all still OTM. no short strikes have been touched.\n\nFor example, I have a short call spread on $GS that has gone against me for 80%, even though my short strike is still otm? I am -1 APR 237.5/240 Call spread and can't believe that that position has appreciated 80% in value even though it is still OTM, overnight. \n\n- am I micromanaging?\n- what, if anything should I do to defend? I'm sitting on about 50% cash still and have capital and time to roll/ manage, but where do I go from here? \n\nTop level edit: /u/doogle brought to my attention that in part, the huge bid/ask spread of some of my underlyings is causing a bit of chaos in my unrealized gain totals.

How can a spread that was sold OTM and remains OTM with ~40 DTE fluctuate by 80% of its value?
