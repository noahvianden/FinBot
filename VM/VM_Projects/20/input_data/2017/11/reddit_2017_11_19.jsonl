Oh wait, I am not in /r/wallstreetbets", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "JD, BABA, BAC,AAPL...", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "BABA and AAPL are two strong stocks that I would hold long term. In fact, I'm holding BABA long term in shares, but I also have a few options. \n\nJD is an odd one - fundamentals are good, but it's manipulated pretty heavily. So it's a tough play (crushed earnings but still hold off hard..). \n\nBAC I don't touch anymore. I realized I don't understand the financial sector, nor do I want to. There's too many variables that affect banks and I can't follow them mainly because I don't understand a lot of it. ", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "What do you mean by JD being manipulated? How does that not apply to baba aswell?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "BABA has a lot of money flowing in from hedge funds, and bigger investors. Tons of call sweeps every week. JD has preformed well fundamentally, but the stock just can't break past 40. It keeps getting pushed back down everytime it has good news. I think eventually this will rally, and rally hard. I feel it acts similar to AMD, where it's stuck in a range even with strong numbers. ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "IMO it can't break past 40 because it's living in the shadow of BABA but recent events like singles day revenue are starting to break that perception. \n\nBABA does have a lot of money flowing in from every direction, but that doesn't mean it's not manipulated. The bigger a company in China the deeper the government is involved and invested in the success of the company. In my mind BABA is much more manipulated than JD because there's just plainly more incentive to, and that's pretty easy to hide & play smoke & mirrors with a VIE.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "BABA is most likely manipulated - but if your long, you're loving it (I've been in BABA for a while). JD however is being manipulated in other direction, which is not fun if your long/bullish on them. ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That's a fair assessment. That's likely why JD has been capped so hard at $40. IMO It'll likely rally hard one day, I think it'll happen in the next year because it's starting to get hard to fudge/ignore now.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't doubt this. I think we'll see a rally before the next earnings report. The numbers from singles day blew through expectations.

That statement was in reference to your comment. You asked me about the two, so I compared it in that statement. However, before that, I did not compare the two. So yes, please point it out.
