{"title": "Writing Puts on High-Priced Stocks", "selftext": "Because standard options contracts each cover 100 shares, how does one get involved in writing naked puts on high-priced stocks like Amazon ($909.28 as of 4/5/17) without having considerable capital available in the event the option is exercised? For example, If I write an Amazon put option at a strike price of $900 and the counterparty exercises the contract, I am accountable to pay $900 price * 100 shares or $90,000 correct? \n\nI'm very interested in writing puts because I like the worst case scenario here; I own the underlying stock at a lower price than I was interested in purchasing it at initially.\n\nIf i only have, say $20,000 available, am I limited to writing puts with strike prices of $200? i.e. if I am exercised $200 price * 100 shares = $20,000 I need to purchase the underlying stock from the counterparty\n\nEDIT; Thanks everyone!
