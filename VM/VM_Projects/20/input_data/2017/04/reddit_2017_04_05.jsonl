Maybe give it a look-see.  If AMZN reaches 920 by then, you make $700.  If it goes further than that, you'll blast off to the moon as delta rises. \n\nDouble edit: WSB and YOLOing is all sorts of fun...

Round to .5\n\nThat means for ever dollar movement in the underlying price, the premium of the option will shift about 50 cents.\n\nThe bid is 39.25.\n\nSo if the share price right now is 906 and rises to 920 before expiry, it'll have gone up $14.  Since the delta estimates the option premium rises at half of that, the premium would be expected to go up $7.\n\nThat would bring the bid price to about $46.25.\n\nSo you spend $4010 and get $4625.\n\n$615 Profit.\n\nSo not quite $700, but still pretty good. \n\nIf it continues past the strike, delta will rise.  That means the correlation between premium and underlying share price will approach 1:1... Which pretty much means your gains will increase exponentially, even if the price of the stock rises linearly.  So you could actually *double* your money if share price rose to 960 (rough estimate) \n\nNow I'm not taking into account theta, which could be a big drag if AMZN takes too long to reach 920...
