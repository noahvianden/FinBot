First, myspace at its peak had 75 million monthly users. Facebook has 1.8 billion currently. Facebook grew incredibly fast because it was the trendy new thing and was far less childish than Myspace. Myspace users flocked to Facebook but kept their myspace accounts. The most important thing for a social media platform is users. People stopped using Myspace when it became clear that more of your networks could be found on Facebook.    People aren't just using Facebook for their immediate friend groups rather their entire network of friends, family and coworkers. It was a snowball affect that solidified into a rock. There were a lot of social media sites competing at the myspace level, and only one that emerged triumphant when the dust settled. Facebook is now a mainstay in our modern lives whether we like it or not. If you want to be the top social media site you'll have to topple Facebook to do it.  Not even Google, with its incredibly talented workforce, power and resources, was able to go toe to toe with Facebook. Plus, if you do become popular enough to seriously challenge Facebook's potential, it may just buy you out. Unlike the reckless acquisitions of many companies in the past, Facebook seems to know how to turn its acquisitions profitable. There are also the countless websites that connect their users (or give the option to do so) to their Facebook accounts. Furthermore, if you're famous or want to be famous you will most likely have a Facebook account. I consider these last two points to be a sort of endless stream of free promotion for the company.
