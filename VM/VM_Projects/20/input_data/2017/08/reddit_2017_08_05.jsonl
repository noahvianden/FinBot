You can't reliably say that even if NVDA beats earnings, it won't still go down.

Using his logic, one wouldn't gamble by buying less than a week before earnings when conditions aren't ideal. Rather, one would wait for a chance to get in at a more favorable valuation. In hindsight NVDA would have been a good buy before really any of the past earnings reports since we know it would still be where it is today, but that does not mean there were not *safer* points to get into the stock, or that past performance is representative of future performance.
