{"title": "How to identify insider trading and profit from it", "selftext": "If someone on Wall Street gets advance knowledge of a takeover\nor some other important information that will greatly affect the\nprice of a stock (earnings surprise, new product announcement,\netc.) greed often takes over, and the person will rush to buy the\nstock or the options to make a “sure” profit. Insider trading—\ntrading with advance knowledge of a corporate event—is illegal,\nbut that doesn’t keep it from happening. It is as if these investors\nhave tomorrow’s newspaper and they want to act on it.\n(But, if you ever do come across tomorrow’s newspaper—play\nthe lottery! Forget options!)\n\nThey often buy options instead of the underlying because of\nthe great leverage available when a quick move occurs. We have\nseen this type of activity for ages, and we look for signs of it so\nthat we might know what these insider traders are doing. It is\nperfectly legal for us to use their activity as a direct technical indicator\nand to attempt to “piggy-back” on their trades. \n\nMost commonly, their activity shows up as dramatically increased trading\nvolume, but it may also show up as an increase in price levels—\nimplied volatility—as well. On some occasions, which we’ll discuss\nshortly, the increase in implied volatility is our only clue as\nto their activities; volume does not increase in those cases. There\nare several examples coming up that will clarify these situations.\nSimplistically, we want to look for one day’s option activity\non a particular stock’s options to at least double its average activity\nfor a day. The average activity is the 20-day moving average\nof option volume on that stock. In addition, we want there\nto be some sort of absolute volume measure. So, we arbitrarily\nset 500 contracts as a minimum number. This would eliminate\nwasting our time looking at situations where the average volume\nis 20 contracts a day, and one day that stock’s options total 50\ncontracts. Insider trading activity will normally generate volume\nwell in excess of 500 contracts, as long as there is a reasonable\namount of liquidity in the stock options. \n\nOnce this situation\nis identified, we want to buy calls (or buy the underlying stock) if\nthere is a heavy preponderance of call volume by whomever is\ntrading these options, and we want to buy puts (or short the underlying\nstock) if there is heavy put trading by these insiders.\nOne other thing to look for is some confirmation by the price\nof the underlying stock itself. If insiders are buying many calls,\nthe stock should begin to move up. This happens for at least two\nreasons: (1) institutions pick up these rumors, too, and they\noften play them by trading stocks; and (2) the market makers\nwho sell the options to these insiders are not stupid; they want\nto hedge themselves after selling the options, and often the best\nhedge is to take an offsetting position in the underlying stock.\nThat is, if the market makers have been selling calls to the insiders,\nthen the market makers might go into the stock market\nand buy stock to hedge themselves.\n\nFrom an outsider’s perspective, like ours, what we want to\nsee is some technical confirmation by the underlying stock. For\nexample, if there’s a small resistance area above where the\nstock is trading, we want to see the stock break through there,\nthus giving a technical confirmation to the call buying that we\nhave been observing and are attributing to insider call buying.\nIf the stock can’t at least go up while all these calls are being\nbought, then perhaps this is not a true insider trading situation.\nTable 2.2 shows how insider trading provides signs of\nchanges in the option market.\n\nThese insider-trading situations tend to manifest themselves\nas rumors in the marketplace. They may appear in chat\nrooms, on bulletin boards, or in newsletters devoted to this type\nof activity. If you take the\ntime to carefully study the option and stock activity in these\nsituations, you can often weed out the “bad rumors”—those\ncreated by someone who wants to move the stock to liquidate his\nor her own position. This type of trader often feels that the best\nway to move the stock is to start a false rumor. Here is an example:\nA stock suddenly falls dramatically, perhaps on bad\nearnings. It is now trading at 10 when it was just trading at 20\na few days ago. Suddenly, a rumor appears that such-and-such a\ncompany is interested in acquiring this stock because its low\nstock price is extremely attractive. The stock then rallies from\n10 to 13 on heavy volume. Who do you suppose is selling at 13?\nRight! The trader who started the rumor at 10, who holds a lot\nof stock bought near 20 and wants to unload it! That is a false\nrumor, and it can often be identified because it does not fit into\nthe typical pattern of activity of an insider.\n\n**Noise**\n\nThere may also be noise—trading volume that has nothing to\ndo with insider trading activity. In that case, we must filter out\nthat noise lest we be misled into buying stocks on which there\nreally isn’t any insider trading. This becomes something of an\nart. It’s hard to say what a typical day is, because the market is\nso dynamic, normally there are between 60 and 100 stocks that\ntrade more than double their average option activity on any\ngiven day. Of those 60 to 100 stocks, only about 5 to 8 have any\nsort of insider trading. The rest are just noise. That is, the volume\nin the rest is a result of other types of market activity that\ninflate trading volume but are not related to any sort of inside\ninformation on the company.\nThere are three main types of activity that we classify as\nnoise, including:\n\n1. Covered call write. Often an institution (mutual fund,\nhedge fund, etc.) decides to write calls against a large\nblock of stock. They may already own the stock, or if the\ninstitution is in the business of hedged option strategies,\nthey may buy the stock and sell the calls at the same\ntime. In any case, the option trade is often large and occurs\nall at one time. Insiders would not be able to buy\n5,000 option contracts at one time from a market maker\nbecause they would not have the proper representation by\nan institutional broker. What normally happens is that,\nsay, Morgan Stanley comes to the trading floor and says\nto the market makers, “We are going to cross 5,000 IBM\nJan 120 calls to a customer. Do you guys want any?” The\nmarket makers will often take a good portion of the trade\nif they think it is priced favorably for them, and Morgan\nStanley will take the rest in their firm’s account. They\nwill also cross the stock if necessary, and the covered\nwrite is in place. Moreover, it is unlikely that an insider\nwould be coming in through Morgan Stanley’s institutional\ndesk and even more unlikely that Morgan and/or\nthe market makers would sell an insider that many calls\nat any price. This often results in almost all of the day’s\noption volume being in one particular option series—and\nit is normally one that is a few months out in time. This is\nnot the type of option that an insider would buy. If you\nhave access to time and sales, you can easily see this; but\neven if you don’t, you can still see that there was little activity\nin any other options on this stock.\n\n2. Arbitrage. Recall that we earlier saw which option\npositions were equivalent to what stock positions. Long\nstock is equivalent to a long call and a short put with the\nsame terms, and short stock is equivalent to a short call\nand a long put with the same terms. If we observe that\nmost of the heavy option activity in a particular day’s\ntrading is an approximately equal number of puts and\ncalls with the same terms, then we can probably surmise\nthat an arbitrage took place—particularly if there is little\nor no option activity in other options on this stock.\nThese trades, too, often occur in large blocks. Say\nsomeone buys 50,000 shares of common, sells 500 calls\nand buys 500 puts (with the same terms). Do not bother\nyourself with why someone is doing this—it is arbitrage,\nand it is not available to commission-paying customers\nlike yourself. This activity can be easily identified with a\ntime and sales screen, but if you don’t have a time and\nsales screen, you can still observe that these large blocks\ndominate that day’s option trading and are therefore most\nlikely noise. An insider wouldn’t buy calls and sell puts—\nselling puts takes too much capital and the reward is limited.\nThis is not what the insider’s interested in.\n\n3. Spread. Many traders of all kinds do spreads. Spreads generally\nlimit risk in one manner or another, but also tend to\nlimit profit potential (you can’t get something for nothing—\nespecially on Wall Street). However, not wanting to limit\nprofit potential, an insider wouldn’t bother with a spread.\nSo, if you observe that there has been a heavy increase in\noption activity, but then you notice that most of it is involved\nin two options that look like a vertical spread\n(same expiration month, different strikes) or perhaps a\ncalendar spread (different expiration months, same\nstrike), then it is most likely that a spread was transacted\nand that this is not a candidate for insider trading analysis.\nIf you have time and sales, it is often easier to identify\nspreads because you can see that both sides of the spread\nwere transacted in equal quantities and at the same time.\nOtherwise, you can make an educated guess", "id": "6vzqm4", "created_utc": 1503680035.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "TL:DR", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "you do the god's work", "score": 18, "replies": []}, {"body": "Probably a homework assignment for fin 101.
