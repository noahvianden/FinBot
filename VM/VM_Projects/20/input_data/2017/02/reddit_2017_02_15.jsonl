Alright so over the past year from the February correction to now both AutoZone and Oreilly's have formed a Head and Shoulders Pattern. For those who don't know what that is, its simply a bearish pattern where a stock is very range bound. The relative neckline (line of resistance) on $AZO is around 730 and on $ORLY its around 250. With developments about Amazon wanting to sell car parts ( http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000586789) and possible Border tax which would jump product prices of AutoZone's and Oreilly's inventory,(they source from mexico and Chaynahh) I could see $AZO breaking the neckline and hitting $660-680 and $ORLY to $230-250 respectively. I'm not pulling these numbers out of thin air. These are based on the rules of Elliot Wave Principle  where stocks will pull back to around the mid-range of the second wave. So I'm going to be straight with this: I have zero money in this right now because I YOLO'd twice into a 12k deficit by the age of 18 but plan to slam in if conditions play out.
