His net worth is somewhere in the neighborhood of $16M, but he won't buy new socks until they are thoroughly worn out.  He worked putting up highline poles, not some high paying job or business ownership.  After 40 years of working, his salary was around $60k.  He farmed after work.  Has a few hundred acres of crops and about 100 head of cattle, 30 pigs.  Almost 80 and while now retired, still does the farming.

They cut coupons and we shopped at wherever we could get best deals, so that's what I still do.  I have no shame using coupons or shopping around, or looking like a fool picking up pennies off the ground.  My wife and I made almost $300k in 2016, which isn't a lot to some, but it's more than either of us grew up living on.

{"title": "Intel VS AMD - Battle For The PC Chip Market", "selftext": "AMD (AMD) has received a lot of buzz recently for its new Ryzen release due to its claimed superior performance and lower pricing over Intel's (INTC) product line but Intel has since slashed prices in the short term while we wait for their new Cannonlake line to be announced later this year. While AMD's Ryzen line may have the wow factor now, Intel's release later this year is set to be the real game changer due to miniaturization of the transistors that essentially makeup a processor.\n\nStock Pricing\n\nAs you can see from the graph above, over the last year AMD has outperformed Intel over 28x due to the market consensus that AMD can compete with Intel on a much larger scale but AMD is still operating at a loss and Intel has countered by slashing prices by as much as 35% to ensure that until their Cannonlake update later this year they do not give up any market share. I believe that the market has over priced in the gains that AMD has achieved over the past year due to a false consensus that AMD is ready to compete with Intel for the lions share of the pc chip market.\n\nIt is also wise to consider the fact that Intel has over 17 Billion in cash and short term investments for both research or acquisitions to make sure that they stay number one, in comparison AMD has about 1.2 Billion in cash.\n\nIntel's quarterly revenue is almost 15x larger than AMD's quarterly revenue but Intel's market cap is only 12x more than AMD's. This is another example how the AMD hype has left Intel significantly undervalued.\n\nProduct Comparison\n\nEvery AMD product is now priced evenly with Intel's product line after Intel's recent price slashing except for the 1800X (AMD's highest performance level) that still has a slight edge over the Intel equivalent. AMD's Ryzen line uses a 14 nanometer FINFET process where as Intel has already been using the 14 nanometer FINFET process for several years now and plans to move to a 10 nanometer (smaller transistors allow for more computing power in the same amount of space) process later this year with Cannonlake. The Intel Kaby Lake update was a minor update where as Cannonlake is going to be game changing due to this smaller process, effectively allowing more computing power in the same space.\n\nWhile AMD may have passed Intel performance for the short term this gain will be short lived after Intel has time to show off their new product line later this year.\n\nMarket Cycle\n\nWith AMD having the high end edge (both performance and price) for the coming months will it translate into sales or will Intel loyalists wait for the next cycle of presumably better performance?\n\nThe high end gaming market tends to wait longer when refreshing their systems (one piece at a time i.e. graphics cards or monitors) and with the recent advances in 4k graphics cards I don't see many high end users wanting to upgrade their CPU with a pending Intel update later this year.\n\nThe enterprise market tends to wait 3 to 5 years before upgrading their servers, so again I don't see a giant push to buy now for anyone who would want the highest end processor.\n\nCombining these factors essentially eliminates AMD's short term advantage and makes Intel the Stock to watch.\n\nConclusion\n\nIntel is set to dominate the next generation processors market and this domination will translate to large shareholder returns. Intel's product will be better, their stock is better priced to grow, and the market is willing to wait for Intel's response to Ryzen. Intel has been branded to be the best and their product has and always will back that up.", "id": "5wpchs", "created_utc": 1488302935.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Good call. \n\nAlso anyone else going all in on INTC for the long play?

They're also solely reliant on Global Foundaries to perfect 7nm, given the trouble Intel has with moving to 10nm I find it very likely that GF will slip 7nm out further.\n\nSecondly, Global Foundries 14nm is not true 14nm and 7nm is not true 7nm in the same way that Intel 14nm or 10nm is calculated. They have elements that are 14nm but it's not all 14nm so it really has to be considered a hybrid between 22nm and 14nm. It's the same thing for 7nm. It should be considered a hybrid of 7nm and 10nm. What this means is Intel will still have a foundry lead in many regards and becomes Intel owns it's own fabs it doesn't have to compete against other companies for fab space. \n\nIf 7nm is really able to work well by 2019 you can guarantee other companies will want in on that which means AMD and Nvidia and QComm will all be jockeying for capacity.

Intel is going datacenter first with their next process shrink so it'll be interesting to see if AMD follows (more expensive, but better payout) or if they choose to do something small like APUs in order to get as high of yields as possible on immature technology. \n\n\nDoes AMD have a new agreement with GF? I thought the spinoff always allowed AMD to shop around, they just had to give GF a 2 year heads up and GF had to continue to support them for those 2 years, at least that's what I read on their annual report. \n\nIt'll be good to see what AMD is able to really do with Ryzen.

The cashier informs you that the code to use the restroom is inside every order, like a crappy cracker jacks prize, so you purchase a $20 plain Shackburger brand burger. After 30 minutes waiting for your order you can’t hold it in any longer, you squat down in the middle of the store and, much like Shake $SHAK’s stock price, prepare to take a massive dump after earnings. It's going to be OK; you brought an extra pair of shorts.**\n\n\nThe bacon bubble hit Shake Shack like an ST elevation myocardial infarction. While Shake $SHAK arrogantly prides itself for using premium ingredients, in this economy, investors understand that better ingredients mean lower margins. In a market where pigs get fat and hogs get slaughtered, Shake $SHAK has been purchasing only the finest overpriced \"all-natural\" hogs. Furthermore, Shake $SHAK employees mixed up my order, evidently incapable of telling the difference between a burger and a hotdog. Customers could care less whether or not you “Stand for something good” try “Standing for shareholder value” instead. With fries like unsalted Styrofoam brand insulation, institutions are sure to have their fingers quivering over their market sell buttons after earnings on Wednesday.  It's undeniable, Shake $SHAK has faced a multitude of problems this past quarter, from shitty locations, to crappy service, to strong competition from the sushi sector, and is set to trade lower than ever in the near future. \n\n**TLDR; Shake $SHAK takes a shit after earnings on Wednesday.**\n", "id": "5wpo5z", "created_utc": 1488306624.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "What the fuck is your obsession with sushi?
