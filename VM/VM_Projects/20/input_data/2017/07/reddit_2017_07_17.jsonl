How do companies make money off of the stock market? For example, Company X has an IPO of 100 million shares at $15. Does this mean that they automatically generate $1.5 billion in revenue assuming all shares are sold?\n\n2. In a similar vein, why does share price matter to say $TSLA and $SNAP? Is it just a matter of good press? Tesla is an extremely hyped company with a lot of promise, and their share price reflects that. However, $SNAP is hyped, but doesn't appear to have the promise that say $TSLA does or $FB did at its IPO.\n\n3. Can new shares be created in a company, and what is the general model behind that? I understand that there needs to be a finite amount of stock in a certain company for the stock to have any value, and that there will generally be someone selling given any point in time (hence general orders for stocks) if I wanted to purchase said stock.\n\n4.

I'm studying for the CA bar exam right now and this is what I have for Treasury stock in the Corporations outline: \n\n>*Treasury stock*. This is stock the company issued and then reacquired. It is considered authorized but unissued, and the corporation can then resell it. If it does, the board sets any issuance price it wants.\n\nThe phrasing of that definition makes me wonder if \"Treasury stock\" refers only to shares that were issued at one time but later reacquired. Since issuing new shares would cause a dilution, right? Whereas simply selling shares again that were part of a prior issuance would not cause a dilution. Do I have that right, or are unissued shares included in \"Treasury stock\" as well? And is the existence of unissued shares already accounted for, or would a public issuance of those shares cause a dilution?\n\nSorry to bug ya, any explanation is appreciated. This outline is shit and I didn't take Corporations.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the reply. I think one thing I had all fucked up until just now was figuring out where the shares come from in an IPO (and I might still not get this actually). I have been assuming up to now that when a corporation is created, the founders/owners have all the initial stock, and all the stock later on can be traced back to the original shares belonging to the owners (taking into account splits of course). But, then there are these stock issuances where the Corp issues brand new shares that didn't exist before, and that would dilute the share price of the previously outstanding shares.\n\nThen I went back to this bar prep book, and here's an example question they put in there:\n\n-- C Corp. is issuing 10,000 shares of $3 par stock. It must receive at least: **$30,000**.\n\nSo, do those shares necessarily originate in the hands of the original shareholders, who decided how many shares should be in existence when they created the Corp, and then at some point choose to sell some of their shares to the Corp? Or can they originate in the possession of the Corp, like if the Board decided it wanted to issue new shares that the Corp didn't have?\n\nThe only real reason that I'm trying to nail down the distinction is because my gut is telling me that, while I don't think anything would prevent a Corp from selling shares that it reacquired from the public after the IPO (b/c they are simply shares of Treasury stock that the Corp is just as free to sell as it was to buy)... I could see how the rules could work differently for shares that the Corp owns but that were never released through an IPO before. My reasoning: I think IPOs have a whole bunch of rules that must be complied with, and SEC approval might be necessary? (again, shitty outline, doesn't really go through this in detail). If the Corp can sell shares it received from a private transaction with the owners, then it would be able to circumvent the requirements for doing an IPO.\n\nPlus, if the Corp were to sell shares to the public that it originally came to possess via a private transaction with one or more of the owners, and the shares had never been publicly traded before, then allowing Corp. to sell them would disadvantage other shareholders, as the supply of shares on the market increases and the price goes down in response. Is this the same as a dilution? I can't tell, I thought a dilution only happened when the Corp actually created new shares for an issuance and increased the total number of shares in existence.\n\n\nI think I'm overthinking it. Gonna just conclude that I'll get lucky and this will be one of the years without a Corporations question. Because if there is one and I type any shit that sounds like what I just wrote, I'm fucked.\n\nedit: and if you own 25%, I own 25%, the public owns 25%, and the Corp owns 25%, don't we all each technically own 25% of the shares that Corp owns? And doesn't Corp also own 25% of its own stake? That seems like it would create an endless loop (a recursion, I think?). I dunno.
