It’s also enough to make some market movers like BlackRock and Citadel return some of their margin, which reduces the total number of dollars in the stock market, which reduces the share price of virtually all stocks. \n\nIt also makes buying homes less-lucrative and therefore less-appealing to companies, softening real estate demand and making housing less-competitive (to what extent only time will tell).\n\nThe worry (well, *a* worry) was that the rate hikes so far would translate to people cancelling vacations en masse, cutting back discretionary spending, etc. which theoretically leads to reduced company profits, leading to layoffs, leading to even less discretionary spending, leading to a recession, leading to more layoffs, leading to less discretionary spending.\n\nTLDR: if the Fed can raise rates to the point where inflation subsides (by means other than directly reducing consumer spending), it means they have achieved that “soft landing” people keep saying is very difficult to achieve.

If you bet in 2021, the taxman may be coming\n\nOver $1 billion was legally wagered on this year's Super Bowl, and about $3 billion was estimated to be wagered during this year's March Madness college basketball tournament, both numbers more than doubled totals from the year before.\n\n\"When PASPA was repealed, I don't think any of us would have expected how big the industry would be just four short years later,\" Karol Corcoran, general manager of FanDuel's online sportsbook, told the AP.\n\n\"It would have seemed impossible just a few years ago to reach such height,\" Dustin Gouker, lead analyst for PlayUSA.com, wrote to MarketWatch in an email. \"But with the expansion of sports betting over the past year it is inevitable that legal wagering will soar.\"\n\nDraftKings president and co-founder Matt Kalish said: \"I got into this industry because I was always the kind of kid who liked to predict things, to compete with my friends and make predictions. For people that like to do that, sports betting has become far and away the No. 1 thing.\"\n\nThe $125 billion wagered figure is nearly three times how much Elon Musk agreed to buy Twitter(TWTR) for, and represents a bigger number than the total market cap for technology giant IBM (IBM). In layman's terms, it's a lot of money.\n\nAfter expenses, sportsbooks generally keep less than 10% of the total amount of bets they handle. Over the first four years of legal betting, their revenue figure is $8.8 billion, according to the American Gaming Association (AGA).\n\nSee also: DraftKings Golden Nugget merger to provide 'revenue uplift,' CEO says\n\nA major rationale for the push to legalize sports betting was to protect customers from being victimized by unlicensed bookmakers, particualary those who operate outside the U.S. State regulations include robust consumer protections, with watchdog regulators ready to pounce when they see violations.\n\nSports betting has been, and still is, pitched to state lawmakers as a source of new tax revenue, a particularly tempting option in the trying financial times of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has generated $1.3 billion in state and local taxes since 2018 according to the AGA, but the amount many states keep is a mere drop in the bucket compared with their overall budget. Some states, like New York, tax mobile sports betting revenue at 51% -- a rate that operators say is not sustainable in the long run. DraftKings CEO Jason Robins even posited that the introduction of sports betting to California could help address problems surrounding \"homelessness and mental health.\"\n\nBettors who used sportsbooks like DraftKings (DKNG), Caesars (CZR) or FanDuel had limited betting options when legal wagering was first introduced -- like picking the outcome of a game or player performance before the event started. Since then, the array of potential bets has spiked due in large part to a surge in live-game betting, where gamblers can react to events as a game unfolds and bet accordingly.\n\n\"The live-betting has been pretty popular since day one,\" former FanDuel CEO Matthew King told MarketWatch in 2021 shortly after the product debuted.\n\nAnd while the more established sportsbooks look to increase their share of the market, the amount of money it takes to enter the industry and compete continues to grow, to the point where many executives of leading companies say they expect some lesser competitors to either merge or stop doing business.\n\nFanDuel's Corcoran said the near-term future is about growing the industry and its individual companies.\n\n\"We feel fortunate to have access to about 38% of the American population,\" he said. \"But there are still millions of people that don't yet have legal sports betting. We'd love to be able to operate where they are.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to the this report.\n\n\\-Weston Blasi\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires", "id": "urnvb6", "created_utc": 1652798204.0, "score": 86, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|47|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|105|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sq4ryy/dkng_updated_morgan_stanley_detailed_analysis_as/) \n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=urnvb6)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=urnvb6)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "That's $125 billion less for WS/BETS!", "score": 22, "replies": []}, {"body": "Balls deep in DKNG", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "DKNG to the moon", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Get out, too many companies in the space with no real reason to value any of them, dk spends all their money advertising to lose to the top of the App Store fan duel or whatever.
