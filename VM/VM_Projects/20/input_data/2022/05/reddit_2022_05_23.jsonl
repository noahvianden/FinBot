Wall Street didn‚Äôt necessarily believe the growth would continue, and didn‚Äôt predict iPhone to be so successful. Even when iPhone became a hit, the Great Recession happened and no one knew If growth would be sustainable or if it was just a fad.

There are many products with better or more sophisticated components but no OS will make them run like iOS. Finally, their growing services division needs some serious attention. Especially, when they roll out the subscription service for devices. Most software subscription companies have over 30 PE.

Back then I was really conflicted whether I should invest and I didn't in the end because the moat and growth story wasn't clear to me. Back then iPhone sales were slowing and while people loved Apple's products there was no real lock in or moat. It wasn't clear to me (or other investors) if Apple was actually different or if they would just end up being the next Nokia, Motorola or Blackberry.\n\nToday it's a lot harder for an iPhone user to switch to Android partly because of the software lock-ins but also because AAPL has now built an ecosystem of services and hardware around the iPhone. For example if you have an Apple watch, Airpods and backup everything to iCloud you're almost certainly going to buy an iPhone next year. I also think the iPhone has stood the test of time at this point and they have developed far more brand loyalty than say Nokia or Motorola ever did.\n\nAnother thing that's different about AAPL today is that they're far more diversified. For a start they get about a quarter of their revenue from services today which is higher margin and stickier than hardware sales. They also get a significant proportion of revenues from wearables, which when combined with the growth in services means that iPhone sales no longer make up the majority of AAPL's sales. Back when AAPL was trading with a PE in the mid teens a bad year for iPhone sales was a bad year for AAPL, but today they can make up for slower iPhone sales with other products and services.\n\nFinally, investors in AAPL today no longer have to rely on continued top line growth because sometime in the late 2010s they started to redirect a huge amount of their cashflows into stock buybacks. While AAPL's growth isn't likely ever be as high as it's been in the past you're still likely to see robust growth in AAPL's share price going forward simply as a result of their large buyback programs.\n\nI was quite critical of AAPL's valuation earlier in the year, but their earnings so far this year have been much better than I expected and their share price has come down considerably since then. Today if AAPL is trading with a PE under 25 I think you can feel pretty safe owning it. That said, given market conditions I suspect it might still have room left to fall. I own a small position here and should AAPL continue to fall I will be likely to add to it.

Might as well skip it.

It goes like there was an island in the middle of a huge ocean where everybody was having a blast. Rich people bought their yachts and the common folks brought their gondola boats. Everyday, the rich and common people used to boat around from the island shore to the middle of the ocean for food. The rich guys used their expensive equipment while the common folks used the traditional method of net for hunt. After everyone was done with their hunting, they used to head back to the island. As the night came down, the rich folks  partied on their yachts, while the common folks used to party on the island itself and hence sleep in the stone cave passed by generations. \n\nAs the days continued by, the people now had to go a little further from the day before because they weren't a lot of things left to hunt in the regions they used to before. As they were going far into the ocean, people started seeing many whales emerging from beneath the ocean. They looked kinda sick because they weren't moving a lot. No one knew the reason why they were slowly dying. Some folks saw this as a warning sign so they took off back to their island. But the rich folks didn't care, and so did some common folks. As the day passed by sharks started appearing in one's, two's and three's, and so on. With passing of each day there were more sharks than the previous one. They used to come for those whales and then leave. Slowly, all the whales disappeared, and hence the sharks too. Everyone thought it was all back to normal, so they continued with their hunting. But then came that fateful day when a swarm of sharks, which looked so hungry, started attacking the people in boats. Heck, there were some big hungry sharks that they even attacked the rick folks yacht. So both the common and rich folks tried to boat around back to the island for safety, but they had come so far off this time around. The yachts, though, were fast so they came back quickly, but the gondola boats were slow. Only the few lucky ones survived. It was all silence on the island. Everyone was quite afraid to head back to the far off water. \n\nDays past by and slowly we could see the water in the ocean started disappearing. Everybody was in amazement, like they saw some kind of magic, but some folks knew this was just the beginning of the bad days that were about to come. As months passed, the people started becoming angry because they now had to look for food in the jungle which wasn't quite tasteful compared to seafood. The rich folks used to come visit the island jungle, too, and take whatever they pleased.. At first people let it be because they thought the resources of the jungle were in plenty. But slowly, as time passed by they too became scarce. Now people from both sides were really getting angry. Riots started breaking out around b/w rich and common folks. The people started fighting against each other. The situation got so bad that rich folks started burning the places of ordinary folks. To which people replied back by throwing rocks at the yachts.\n\nAs the years passed by, only the few survived to live the tale and were able to live off of the island's scare resources. As time progressed the water in the ocean started coming back and so were resources of the island that got depleted, replenished as more folks started going around for the hunt. And hence the cycle repeated itself again for 10 or more yrs.\n\nMoral of the story : I leave it to you people to decide in the comments section. Also, the last paragraph is kinda my interpretation of what happened. I leave that up to you. Hey, maybe no one survived to live the tale.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Streak of losses](https://preview.redd.it/0p0fdaqs76191.png?width=1382&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb2ae85f441ef944661f785dc823c2804de42031)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Recap : 16th May - 20th May**\n\nThe last week was pretty crazy. S&P 500 finally entered its bear market and dropped to almost -22%. whereas the Nasdaq declined about -30% making this market performance as the worst since 1931 \"Great depression\". We also had 7 straight weeks of red which is just behind the March 2001 \"Dotcom crash\" and May 1970 \"Stagflation\".  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Apple warning : Later i said if Apple looks bad so will Tesla.

So it indeed happened. Apple dropped below its 100 week MA and Tesla got hammered with FUD articles. Elon Musk thinks its a ploy by democrats.. What do y'all think. Tell me about in the comments section.  \n\n\nBy the way guys I see no one in Wall street bets talk about things before 1987. Why is that ?  \nEveryone just wants to either compare things with recent recession of 2008 or they want the 1987 \"Black Monday\" crash where DOW dropped -20% in a day. I think people are really getting tired of this constant velocity crash with no acceleration to the downside. Some Economists thinks Powell should just rug-pull and kill the economy in a day. Why to wait for 6 months when things can be done in a day. Pretty shitty argument in my opinion cause why would you want to pressure economy in just a single day.\n\nAlso some other Economists are calling for retail capitulation. I have no idea guys. It could come or not come before June or July FOMC. But it sure is heck is coming in Q4. ( It will be marked by capitulation in retail stocks, )  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Hedge funds top Investments](https://preview.redd.it/ci20463xb6191.png?width=922&format=png&auto=webp&s=b08bfa1fb4ec35b7187b37d21d6527e82474e773)\n\nI was very lucky last week to have time and watch \"Jeremy Grantham\" and \"Ray Dalio\" my two favorite logical investors together for an online video conference where they talked about their views on economy. Both of them have a pretty different outlook for the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Ray believes the changing world order is about to happen in this cycle where the China and rest other emerging markets from Asia such as India will boom as compared to USA where we could have a bust. (But his fund has an allocation to FTSE 100. Interesting) \n* Jeremy believes we are in for a dotcom style crash.\n\n  \nBut both of them don't believe in the idea of recession this year but yeah the risk of stagflation are increasing day by day according to them. Growth in their opinion though will be slowing in the upcoming years.  \nAlso do watch \"All in podcast\" show.

Let me bore you once again.\n\n  \nWe will eventually go into b/w of forgotten depression of 1921 and full blown depression. Depression is just a longer lasting recession. Recession in my opinion will happen later in Q4 because I don't think coming GDP print will be -ve but i think next one and the next one in January will be. \n\n  \nHence i always say when Dow jones hits anywhere b/w 50 MMA - 200 MMA just start DCAing in index ( picking stocks is hard ) like SPX, Nasdaq, DJI.\n\nOr if you really wanna buy stocks then go ahead pick the best stocks and DCA ( no one knows the true bottom ) that will last 10yrs. And have patience and conviction.\n\n  \nAlso we have short term swing trade in indices coming up. We could do this by DCAing index in before June or July FOMC and then sell in before September arrives.  \nYou could play options or specific stocks but i wont help you with which ones. I prefer index.\n\n  \n \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Charts of the week** \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate](https://preview.redd.it/3u1mbte1p6191.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=be8ad4eb170a698565741d60a7d49df1296addc5)\n\nObservation 1 : The 10yr breakevens on the chart are first thing that tops. It tells investors inflation problem is about to happen. Then it's the inflation that starts rising. Now depending upon the inflation level the bond yields rise. More the inflation more the Fed becomes hawkish. Hence at the end its the interest rate that tops. So in a sense 10yr breakevens are the leading indicator for inflation level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chart Dow Jones , Violet : 10yr breakevens, Sky blue : Inflation, Orange : 10yr yields, Yellow : Interest rate](https://preview.redd.it/h0cjy551q6191.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=72cce6906e84c0c7ea9788d6f384581e7a58575e)\n\nObservation 2 : The 40 year cycle. We already know that the stock market revolves around a cycle. The 1940 - 1980 cycle in which the bond yields made higher high's and higher low's. And then the 1980 - 2020 cycle where bond yields made a lower high's and lower low's.\n\nDuring the first 40 cycle the interest rate peaked before the bond yields and were more higher in number. In the next 40 cycle the interest rate peaked after the bond yields and were much lower.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Boom Bust cycles XD](https://preview.redd.it/6flgxtk1v6191.png?width=1701&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb484b83893544c369e7464ebec953625014be9c)\n\nObservation 3 : ( Don't laugh) So everyone knows how a economy works. I have taken a segment from a way longer cycle of economics passed from generations. ( The 90yr cycle ) We have a period of boom and then we have a period of bust. The boom period from 1980-2020 is over in my opinion where the talk was about globalization\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chart : Dow Jones , Orange line : Bond yields , Blue line : Inflation ](https://preview.redd.it/9xvnvb4t07191.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f82a75ceefbb99dff97840164118168305ebaf5)\n\nObservation 4 : Let's find out where in history we could be. So high inflation with low bond yields right. So it could be the 1940's or 1948 when Fed decided to kill inflation by raising rates so high that it caused a deflationary period.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResult : I have no idea where are we.

But what we don't know is when to buy gold. We all know in financial crisis gold will fall too or when Powell goes for aggressive rate hike. But it wont capitulate like equities because gold moves slow. It's only in the parabolic moves that gold moves fast. But there are factors that causes it. So the narrative around it will surely come by 2025.\n\nMeaning. We buy some now and some portion in crisis. We will add silver too because it will move a lot if Gold goes parabolic.Kinda like how large cap help move small caps.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResult : $6 Gold ( $3 right now + $3 in crisis ) + $4 Silver ( $2 right now + $2 in crisis )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n  \n**Step 2 : 30% bonds.**\n\nNow this thing is kinda hard to predict and is a matter of preference because there are many types of bonds available. What i will be doing is outperforming those other corporate bonds which gives high return but there are risk associated with it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This chart tell us low yield bonds are about to be bought as compared to high yield risk bonds](https://preview.redd.it/1c7wq9l7s7191.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=10cf499d408d901e549adac71debf8b4a3af9eaa)\n\nSo I picked TMF for this because i'm chasing high returns with no risk at all. Yes sure its a leveraged ETF but from this chart i know in coming few months most investors will be flocking to longer yield bonds because the growth scare hasn't yet been priced in.\n\nHence the TMF bond will peak because of max euphoria at the end of Q4. My projection are already given in the charts. The only risk to it is change in terminal rates (3.2% aug 2023) or changing the definition of neutral.( 2-3%)  \n\n\nTMF ( No income ) = 3 x TLT ( It gives fixed income quarterly )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResult : $15 right now in TMF + $15 ( wait for june TLT )\n\n  \n\n\n**Step 3 : 60% Equities.**\n\nNext 60% will be to equities. For this i will picking winner stock with 2025 max profits guarantees. It is up to you guys to decide which winner stock and how much should be in portfolio. And at what price levels are you comfortable with. \n\n&#x200B;\n\na) Voldemort class ( These class of stocks are linked to the asset class i cannot name here because i will get banned. But hey we can name the stocks )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIncludes : MTTR, MSTR, COIN, HOOD, HUT8, COIN, \n\nWinner : MTTR, COIN\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason : MSTR is bound to get liquidated since saylor is known for crisis like dotcom. HOOD c'mon guys we all hate it. Also Vlad is such a shit CEO. If he gets removed as CEO and Sam Bank man like Elon makes a play for position then heck yes. It could be proxy to investing with FTX. HUT8 hmm. I just don't like mining stocks.\n\nMatterport on the other hand has got metaverse play in it. So im expecting it to do a 8x by then and everybody loves Brian. Heck even the SEC too. He's got good leadership skills and would do anything for the company. $40 was such a good deal. Man i missed it. It was trading below its funding valuation and 2x the money they had.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nb) EV play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIncludes : Rivian, Ford, GM, Tesla, Nio, Lucid\n\nWinner : Tesla, Nio\n\n  \nReason : I'm going calling the dibs on Tesla even though its price can fall to $380. Coz why won't you wanna have Tesla in your portfolio. Its still got India play left inside it. Yes supply chain are the problems but i believe this company will get help from china. Hence Nio too. So allocate some to Tesla and Nio. Nio because George Soros who broke bank of England is buying heavy. So Hf's or institutions would not even possibly think of shorting this stock. Such is the fear of Soros in Wallstreet. \n\n  \n\n\nc) Gaming play + Chips\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIncludes : AMD, Intel, Nvidia\n\nWinner : Nvidia ( Little partial )\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason : I am partial to this even though AMD has started producing cheaper and better products and aren't suffering in supply chain as much. Nvidia in my opinion is world class and its products last longer than other products. Also there is a heavy demand by consumers. Nothing will ever change that. It's kinda like Apple of the space. Also its the leading in ml + ai too. I believe Tesla and Nvidia will partner in future. I could be wrong here and hey maybe AMD kicks its butt but i'm gonna go Nvidia. Also AMD has to fight some FUD articles in the future. Its up to you guys to decide. But i sure as hell don't want you to buy intel.\n\n  \n\n\nd ) Payment play\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIncludes : VISA, Master card, PayPal\n\nWinner : Paypal\n\n&#x200B;\n\nReason :They are doing so much in Voldomort asset class. VISA wtf are you doing though by joking around with that sh9t.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\ne ) The others\n\nRest guys i believe in peace so no Palantir for me. And since Jamie Dimon is leaving i think JP Morgan will fall. If he stick around till 2025 then i sure as hell would keep this in my portfolio.  \n\n\nAlso i don't want Ecom in portfolio ( AMZN + Target + Walmart ) but i sure as hell want Google. Its got that growth in slowing economy factor for me. Because who forgets to search on google and play videos on Youtube.  \n \n\nAnd then there is Cathie wood and her Roku. Look guys if she is doing an insider trading and knows something about the company that we don't then sure go all in on that stock only. Also remember the people who created SARKK have launched another ETF called ARKK leveraged 3x. So maybe if money flows around in it like SARKK then hey Roku gets most of the money since its her top holding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWinner : Google + Roku ( On your own level of risk )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nf ) International\n\nSince China is about to stimulate its economy and Hong Kong basically is under china control then expect the popular stocks over there to grow as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIncludes : BABA, JD, Tencent  \n\n\nWinner : BABA, Bytedance ( If it goes public )\n\n  \n\n\nReason : Amazon and Target money will flow here. Also the low PE / PEG ratio is highly attractive. And hey Munger is buying alongside Blackrock and Bridgwater.  \n\n\nRemember we chose Nio too. So keep them at 20% and divide yourselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote : The winner decision is solely according to me. Also i haven't given the price levels to buy. That is upto you guys to decide. This is not a Financial advise. As for the proof that i am buying here are my positions on some of the things that i went shopping around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Tesla + TMF](https://preview.redd.it/c5lz9sd7h8191.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a41dbbe1fa648d893173647ef039243f0224722a)\n\n[The amount has not yet been credited yet.](https://preview.redd.it/bu29d5g7h8191.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3cbe69fa87a1db5598fcd2b7974c53829d542d6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Result :** It shall be knows until 2024-2025.\n\n**Conclusion :** Fuck i don't know if it will work. But hey if a monkey can beat the stock market so can this monkey too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.s. I was quite heartbroken on Sunday so i was unable to write anything. Had to drink so much that this time that i couldn't write anything. \n\nLiverpool lost the EPL guys. We came so close. Had the Villa hold on for 20 more minutes what a script it would have been. Felt bad for that goalie though and Gerrard. Imagine slipping twice. Next week we kick Real ass in UCL.\n\n(Post Hang over post )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith lots of love guys.\n\nThank you.\n\nRegards\n\nUchiha", "id": "uw2cp5", "created_utc": 1653318469.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "100$ portfolio?  r/antstreetbets -->", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "It's for fun.

{"title": "Fed's Bostic suggests pausing rate hikes in September to assess impact", "selftext": ">It \"might make sense\" for the Federal  Reserve to pause further interest rate hikes following expected  half-point rate increases over the next two months as the central bank  assesses the impact on inflation and the economy, Atlanta Fed President  Raphael Bostic said on Monday.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\"After  you get through the summer...I think a lot of it will depend on the  ground dynamics that we are starting to see\" both of the inflation the  Fed is trying to contain and the impact of higher interest rates on the  economy, Bostic said in comments to the Rotary Club of Atlanta.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>\"I think a pause in September might make sense,\" Bostic said.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Bostic's comments are the most overt  suggestion yet that the Fed might see enough progress on inflation -- or  enough weakness in the economy -- to pause its rate increases as soon  as September to take stock.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Investors  expect the Fed to continue raising rates through this year, putting the  federal funds rate in a range between 2.75 and 3% by year's end. Some of  Bostic's colleagues have called for a more aggressive push to put the  rate at 3.5%, which would involve half-point increases at all the Fed's  remaining meetings for the year.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Bostic said he expects a shallower set of moves, with the funds rate ending at a range of 2 to 2.5% at the end of 2022.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>While  there is risk the central bank may have to be more aggressive, \"I'm an  optimist and I'm assuming inflation will have started to definitively  move\" lower by then, Bostic said.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Even  so, there are mounting concerns about a global growth slowdown and about  how resilient the U.S. economy will be to rising rates, falling equity  values, and other adjustments still to come. Bostic said he expected,  for example, that the impact of higher borrowing costs may accelerate in  coming weeks as potential buyers are priced out of housing markets by  rising mortgage rates, and households and firms slow purchases out of  caution over the economic outlook.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The  challenge, Bostic said, is to walk the \"knife edge\" between raising  rates so high as to cause a recession while still ensuring enough is  done to curb price increases.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>The  economy's response to higher rates \"is going to accelerate over the next  several months,\" Bostic said. \"If we're not on it, there's a risk that  we will keep moving beyond the point where these markets have found the  equilibrium.\"\n\nVia: [https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/bostic-baseline-is-pause-rate-hikes-september-assess-impact-2022-05-23/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/bostic-baseline-is-pause-rate-hikes-september-assess-impact-2022-05-23/)", "id": "uwamt7", "created_utc": 1653340633.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|57|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|404|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uwamt7)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uwamt7)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You gotta hand it to the Fed.
