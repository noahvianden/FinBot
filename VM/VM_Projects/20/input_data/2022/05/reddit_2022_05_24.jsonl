It would be quite a surprise if Apple can’t replicate what Meta can deliver and I think this will be critical but Apple don’t have the same operational knowledge.\n\nApple have gone after Meta deliberately on data sharing and limiting FBs, IG, WhatsApp capabilities via data curbs…..they are clearly in a fight and I think that’s because Apple can see the potential of Metaverse and Occulus/Cambria to next gen both communications and how we use our tech…..I read one article that posted a review of the screen set up on Cambria and it was impressive. Effectively you could have 3 screens open while walking round your kitchen eg you can see in the background where you are but still have screens in the foreground meaning you can have Instagram, Twitter and Reddit on at the same time scrolling all three and responding/interacting or you can have your trading platform centre and news feeds either side or can be doing an online personal trainer work out main screen while emails on one screen and Instagram on the other all the while making phone calls via 5G - for generations that have grown up using this tech, the ability to multi scroll platforms will be compelling and that means IPhones/IPads have competition. \n\nAn Occulus costs 1/3rd of the price of an IPhone 13. Cambria is supposed to cost the same as an IPhone 13…..jury is out of whether it can offer more than an IPhone or it’s user experience is as good or better……I can’t imagine swapping an Iphine or IPad for a clunky heavy piece of head ware like Occulus but apparently the focus of the Cambria design has been user experience eg comfort, weight etc…..something the size and weight of an IPhone 13 that can offer what Cambria promises and suddenly the gap on user experience starts to narrow. \n\nFor me though the absolute money spinner is in the content side and crypto and the list posted above setting this out is spot on. I have no crypto but reading the article it led me to CEEK who are or were an Apple Metaverse partner who are a private company but setting up “gigs” in the Metaverse. The scalability of this is incredible. lady Gaga doesn’t have to leave her studio to perform in front of 1 million VR users or far more! Imagine being pitchside VR for the Super Bowl. Imagine the advertising revenue from either of these gigs! Thing is, CEEK have recently started partnering with Meta on gigs even though they aren’t an official partner on their website and apple is.

{"title": "JPOW SPEECH TODAY 5/24/2022", "selftext": " Good morning, and welcome. It is a great pleasure to welcome all the attendees to RES 2022.\n\nThe National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development has been a strong and consistent partner to the Federal Reserve, collaborating with us on small business COVID surveys, serving on the Leadership Council for the Minneapolis Fed’s Center for Indian Country Development, and moderating our policy webinar series on tribal enterprise diversification, just to name a few.\n\nTrust is earned and developed through relationships. This is particularly important in Indian Country. The Federal Reserve has built an enduring and sturdy bond with the National Center, and we value that partnership.\n\nWe are excited to be participating in this year’s conference, learning alongside you. There is undoubtedly more research and engagement to be done on the specific and unique economic needs of tribal nations and Indigenous communities. RES 2022 is a great meeting ground for such collaboration.\n\nThe best insight and analysis come from people who live and work in communities and have an inside view of the struggles and opportunities within. The Federal Reserve System has made a priority of engaging with leaders and stakeholders on opportunities most relevant to tribal economic prosperity. For example, input from tribal stakeholders has been invaluable to informing the important work of modernizing the Community Reinvestment Act, which was incorporated into the recently published proposal that we are looking forward to getting comments on. We also value the growing representation of tribal voices on our boards of directors and advisory councils at Reserve Banks, helping us to better understand economic conditions in Indian Country.\n\nMany of you are aware of the Center for Indian Country Development (CICD), our national institute dedicated to helping tribes reach their full economic potential. We are excited to be expanding its capacity to conduct economic research and data analysis to support the long-term economic prosperity of Indian Country, in partnership with Indian Country. We look forward to CICD’s ongoing collaboration with tribal communities on research and data.\n\nAdditionally, an initial St. Louis Fed partnership with the Osage Nation, to provide youth financial education, has led to partnerships with tribal governments across the country that provide personal finance education, often in their Native languages. Tribal leaders nationwide have also joined recent listening sessions to discuss the impacts of inflation. Similar sessions were held on our pandemic response facilities, which were adapted after hearing their input.\n\nOther Federal Reserve partnerships with Indian Country include initiatives on access to credit; Native community development financial institutions; financial education programs tailored to early childhood, secondary, and higher education; workforce development; housing; social services; and elder programs.\n\nAnd as part of our ongoing effort to deepen our understanding of tribal economies, last year, the Federal Reserve Board announced that we had joined the Central Bank Network for Indigenous Inclusion, along with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Bank of Canada, and the Reserve Bank of Australia. This is part of our commitment to learning best practices and expanding our international partnerships with central banks that are similarly invested in supporting Indigenous people and communities.\n\nThe Federal Reserve works for all of us, and our research and analysis must reflect the specific needs and circumstances of all of our communities. I am grateful for our partnership with the National Center for American Indian Enterprise Development, and I want to thank you, as well as all our colleagues, advisors, and stakeholders who help us work toward a stable and inclusive economy for all.\n\nThank you.", "id": "uww0wl", "created_utc": 1653412956.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|392|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uww0wl)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uww0wl)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "TL:DR JPOW: \"I have nothing to offer you\"", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Au contraire.
