My conviction is based on the idea that most stockholders I know are incredibly long as a result of the belief in changing food trends: eating habits; long commitment of financial stock communities' beliefs in buying the dip: Financial Education; improving gross margin positions as robotics gets fully implemented next quarter; TTCF receiving a strong line of credit; and profitability only being one year and one quarter away.  \n\nRight now, margin is not where it should be. However, with a slow decrease in inflation, robotics, and scale, margins should start to look better with the quarters coming forward. TTCF revenue grew 15% even though their product's prices are the highest in the freezer aisle. Also, like TESLA, TTCF is vertically integrated. Therefore, they will be able to lower their costs and become more efficient in the long-term. TTCF is in every major retailer. Since the sell through has been high, stores are increasing their shelf space. TTCF is also expanding their product offering with higher margin products in the short term: snacks and refrigerated items. When TTCF starts becoming profitable, this stock will move-especially with the high short position. Wall Street is usually two to three steps ahead. When large investment firms have permission to enter, when TTCF becomes profitable, TTCF will shoot up like a rocket creating an incredible short squeeze. The time to own this company is now when the company is inching upward at a very slow rate. \n\nDisclosure: I do own the stock as well as long-term options extending past the date of when they will likely be profitable. Also, like Jeremy from Financial Education, I am long on this stock. It may be too early for most short-term investors to buy this stock. However, I would like to put this stock on small retail investors' radar; it is hard to predict when big money will come into the scene creating large upward movement. \n\nI hope you do your DD on this stock and make your own analysis.", "id": "wpnwsn", "created_utc": 1660635148.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.49, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wpnwsn)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wpnwsn)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Is this you Jeremy!?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "LOL.

{"title": "8-16-22 Spy/ ES futures and Apple Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "MODS- reposting do to other being removed by a correctly spelt word that also happens to be a banned ticker... can we get that fixed please?   \n\nWell as I mentioned yesterday if we hit that 431.8 area and hard reject that you were about to be served the worlds greatest put opportunity. And boy was it an opportunity! I was unfortunately picking the kiddos up and missed it myself but wow talk about a hard reject! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/86c67lipd5i91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffde228133d98d7f234668edadf21769197e3163\n\nWell we are quickly eliminating resistance and support lines from the mix. Today we broke below that black dotted support line and we perfectly rejected the red solid rising wedge resistance AND the bear market resistance line while managing to close at the daily level resistance. Lots of resistance here huh? \n\nTomorrow is where things will get interesting. \n\nKey support tomorrow-\n\n427.2 -> 424.8 -> 423.5 (9 week bull support) \n\nKey resistance tomorrow-\n\n429.8 (daily resistance level) -> 431.4 (bear market resistance) -> 434 (red rising wedge resistance)\n\nOverall watching how we reacted here and the fact that we have no had 5 green days in a row (technically one of them was 0.00% but still 5 in a row green) I have a feeling tomorrow we are going to see a red day and test some supports down below. \n\nWe have FOMC minutes tomorrow and while that does not always mean a red or green day usually from 2pm to 3pm we see a fairly big green move when the news it released. I posted to the server my game plane and will update my game plan tomorrow with the premarket post. \n\nI most likely will be looking for a back test of support down near 427.2 and potentially 424.8 if there seems to be a pretty big overnight or morning drop. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lfw265dqd5i91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0df906daf2e296f98ca43e59ce764770471d37d4\n\nFutures daily looks a little different in that we broke through the blue resistance line of the rising wedge and we broke through support of it. However, today we did not see the bulls test the ES futures bear market resistance. We are seeing more of a doji daily candle finish for futures though compared to SPYs candle.\n\nResistance-\n\n4330 -> 4352\n\nSupport-\n\n4300 -> 4277\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nclnzexqd5i91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=201e90049542e107f1f5cd4f9bb580871d2235ec\n\nSPY weekly you can see we rejected the weekly resistance level of 431.7 very nicely today and the black dotted resistance line, however, failed to reach out and touch the actual weekly bear market resistance closer to 432.7.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5dzmgvlrd5i91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f04885e9276e15549641165a802e0e803d789ae\n\nFutures is about the same looking but we failed to touch the black dotted rising wedge and the bear market level. However, futures weekly is setting up more like a doji candle at this moment. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l8o4ug9sd5i91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9534dd6ec21ad064580c32095020f297e91ba3eb\n\nApple and tech in general today showed the most weakness of the whole market. With apple finishing red and SPY green. Most of the morning Apple showed a great deal of weakness. \n\nCurrently we are seeing a double top with a doji which could signal a small pullback is warranted tomorrow. We are also seeing that 6 day long black solid rising wedge support broken through now. \n\nKey support-\n\n172.1 -> 171 (red dotted rising wedge)\n\nKey resistance-\n\n173.3 -> 174 -> 174.5 (bear market resistance) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/11buf2wsd5i91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=33403e3ef69d8136d980f7c676a5d6f705533c75\n\nApples weekly is actually setting up for a possible top of this run candle with a current hammer candle developing. Key weekly resistance is 174.5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yck4sijtd5i91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=13e56e5a89bfcd43e25cdb42c2f55f0d5e4bb78e\n\nThe VIX continues to stay put around this 19.7 level refusing to break lower or higher. We are finally starting to see some consolidation and sideways movement on the VIX much like we did with the March top. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall great day for me. Played a nice call and a nice put scalp today. Missed the massive dump from 431.8 while getting the kiddos but overall great day and great week so far. \n\nTomorrows FOMC minutes which also brings a great opportunity that I look forward to for sure. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/45k8iv1ud5i91.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7d28f860d146a7ebe723d2690e90eac1a6390ce\n\nYoutube will be up later.", "id": "wq6x0a", "created_utc":

Also, my trade plan for today was to get long once we got to 3375/80 level. Sat that out too. \n\nHowever, once it worked its way back to the lower limit of the intraday triangle it broke down from and didn’t reject back downward…I got a little interested. Got long calls made $4 on the trade (I mean per contract, not total gain). Anyway, that got me off the mat though still down a little for the day and another small loser in the afternoon…basically just gave back yesterday’s small gain when all was said and done. So down a negligible .3% for the week so far. \n\nLiving in constant fear of being caught in a liquidity break like we saw late afternoon. Glad I missed that one. Hopefully a healthy fear that will keep me solvent long term. \n\nOk, on to the Fed minutes prep with Daddy’s analysis. \n\nGood luck tomorrow everyone!", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I know.
