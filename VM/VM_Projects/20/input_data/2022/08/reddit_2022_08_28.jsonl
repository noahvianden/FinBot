{"title": "What I learned from trading and how you can become a better trader. (2/4)", "selftext": "**Reason #3:**  \nYou are pumped up on **GREED**. That is something everybody struggles I get that, but many of you don’t even see that you have it or struggle with it. If a got a penny for every post I came through that said something about “I was up over 500% and now down 98% within x amount of hours, I don’t know how that happened.” Because **YOU GOT GREEDY**, you ape. How do you think the stock market works? Stock price only goes up, up, up, and only up? If that was your thought process, quit the game for some time and go back to the drawing board, and learn the basics. I swear you crayon eaters will see over 10,000% gain and still won’t sell. Do you realize what that means? No? That means you are meant to lose around 99% of your plays, you’re not meant to win with this mentality. Ever heard of the saying “slow one wins the race”? This saying is 100% true, when people try to get rich quickly they usually get too blind by quick gains and lose their heads.  \nThis brings me to **lesson #3**: learn the value of money, it is hard to get. There is a quick way to obtain some like behind wendy’s dumpster, but overall it is hard and takes a lot of effort and time. Be very careful. Just because you can turn $1,000 into $25,000 overnight with stocks doesn’t mean it’s easy, it is very hard and rare, so be very careful with your plays.  \n \n\n**Reason #4:**   \nYou listen to some schmuck online and take that ape for a profit. Nobody has a magic ball that can foresee the future, it is all chance. This game is so much better than straight-up gambling at the casino because you have significantly more chances of succeeding but still at the end of the day it is still a gamble and just a chance, calculate one but still a chance. I see so many posts saying that ticker **X** will reach **Y or Z** number by the end of this or that date, and you losers buy into it. Nobody knows what the future holds and if somebody says ticker **X** will reach a certain number by the end of someday, **RUN!** They don’t know what they are talking about, they talk straight out of their ass. Anything is possible in the stock market, the share price can go from $1 to $50 in a day, or can fall over 25% nobody knows what will happen, people just put their bets, which is gambling and that is a very different mindset. If you want to have steady gains and not be hit off guard, do your own research and learn more about the stock market.  \nThat brings me to **lesson #4:** Never believe what anybody says regarding the price and date of a stock, take into consideration that the future is unpredictable. Do your own math and homework.  \n   \n \n\nPositions: 1ct AAPL 165 PUT Sep 02 2022 (+53%) 2cts ASO 44 PUTs Sep 30 2022 (+1.27%) \n\n2cts RIOT 7 CALLs Jun 16 2023 (-15.56%)", "id": "x03bv9", "created_utc": 1661713772.0, "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|31|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|421|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=x03bv9)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=x03bv9)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You can't stop me from my addiction", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Ain’t nobody stopping you!
