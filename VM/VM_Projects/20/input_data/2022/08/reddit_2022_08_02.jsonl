{"title": "JP Morgan quant who called summer rebound in stocks says rally could continue even if corporate profits decline", "selftext": "Investors worried about the next pullback for stocks might want to pause and consider this: the decline in equity valuations since the start of the year already has exceeded the average pullback of other recessionary periods since the early 1990s, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s equity quant Marko Kolanovic. While more Wall Street analysts have been painting a grim picture of the trajectory of corporate profits this year, Kolanovic, who successfully called the summer stock-market rebound, said investors might be pricing in too dire of an outcome for stocks, even if the American economy falters.\n\nInstead, U.S. equity valuations already were seeing a dramatic re-rating lower, even by the standard of a typical recession, he argued, in a Monday research note. As part of his bullish argument, Kolanovic looked at the next-twelve months (NTM) price-to-earnings ratio — perhaps the most popular ratio used to express equity valuations — and found that it exceeded the average pullback in recessionary periods over the past 30 years.\n\nKolanovic also found that this year’s pullback would be the second-biggest to follow a recession, should one be declared. To be sure, valuations (using NTM earnings expectations as the denominator) occasionally have been lower, like when stocks bottomed in March 2020 in response to the COVID pandemic. During said pullback, the S&P 500’s NTM price-to-earnings multiple bottomed out around 15.5x, marking a drop of nearly 7x (see chart) from its January peak. By comparison, in March 2020 the S&P 500’s NTM price-to-earnings ratio hit a low of 13x. The findings would seem to support Kolanovic’s view that U.S. stocks already priced in a mild recession. His analysis comes after the busiest week of the second-quarter earnings season, with corporate performance holding up surprisingly well considering the U.S. economy has contracted now for two consecutive quarters.\n\n**Full report here-** [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jp-morgan-quant-who-called-summer-rebound-in-stocks-says-rally-could-continue-even-if-corporate-profits-decline-11659393877?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jp-morgan-quant-who-called-summer-rebound-in-stocks-says-rally-could-continue-even-if-corporate-profits-decline-11659393877?mod=home-page)", "id": "we5845", "created_utc": 1659425271.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "The “come hold our bags” rally", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Bingo", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "\"Broken clock read the correct time once today so far so let's trust everything it says now\"", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "I am also ready to hold your bag no problemo doomer", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This \"quant\" was calling for a rebound in January, March, May...", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "But he called the one in June.

An example is an account with a lot of bullish trades which takes big losses if the market were to crash.  If delta-neutral then there would be both bullish and bearish trades so if the market crashed the bearish trades will profit to help offset the bullish trades losing.\n\nThere are two flaws in this logic IMHO.  First, the market tends to move up far more than go down.  The bull run we just had was almost 10 years long, so those keeping their account delta neutral likely lost more during this time than the possible losses during a crash.  In this way, it gives a false sense of security.\n\nSecond, is that this is a lot of trading and work to maintain a delta-neutral account.  It will require near constant trading as the market is always moving around meaning the delta is also moving around.\n\nMost market crashes are not the 1929 or even the 2008-09 type, but more like the March 2020 covid crash where it took only a few weeks for the markets to come back.\n\nThis is a case where the cure can be worse than the disease . . .\n\nIt may make sense for those with multi-million dollar accounts or hedge funds, but for the average Joe trader it should be questioned.
