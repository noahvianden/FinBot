If the same bear market rally occurs we will be taken to around 390ish by mid Nov. this year. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong-term outlook: Bearish\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tk5n974nkmt91.jpg?width=1602&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ec6db85c33dba454d3934890dce366568e3b4e76\n\nOkay let's look at that 348 level; see how in 2020 we made a HUGE double bottom from Sep. to Nov.? Well, the top of that double bottom is the exact point we bounced from. Also, we didn't turn parabolic until AFTER we broke 348. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll in all, we are probably going to the 390 level by mid Nov. and then starting our next decline to most likely 330 because that is top of the previous bull run. I suspect we get a good rally from 330-320 when we reach it. That area is both the top of the last bull run and the bottom of the HUGE double bottom. \n\nHappy Trading you degenerate gambling addicts!", "id": "y37ugc", "created_utc": 1665690009.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|22|**First Seen In WSB**|11 months ago\n**Total Comments**|5219|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wx5c9y/update_bearish_case_imo_im_pretty_autistic_so/) [x](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) [x](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/udx02f/google_play_this_upcoming_split/) \n**Account Age**|11 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=y37ugc)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=y37ugc)\n    \nHey /u/KoGamer01, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: After midterm elections by buying puts at around 390.
