One of these is the inefficiency and lack of transparency in the sale of advertisements, which the author then uses to say that they are \"overvalued\". The implication of this is that if the markets were more transparent and efficient the total money spent on advertising would be less (hence one kind of bubble) but there isn't really any evidence that this is the case. It seems to imply that if fat is cut out of a system it will get passed on to consumers (in this case the people buying advertisements) but as a rule this doesn't tend to be what happens. The money might be redistributed among those selling ads, but unlikely to be significantly reduced.\n\nThe other point (and probably much more important) is that the ads evidently don't work that well. This certainly is a concern when companies like Google have so much tied up in what is to some extent a fake product. On the other hand, the author correctly points out that this is a  problem that has existed since the beginning of advertising. So, as a long term issue the risk is that there will be a better form of advertising and that these same companies won't be in on it. But, unless businesses decide to stop advertising altogether the model doesn't fall apart. And keep in mind that at any medium to large size business there are also people deeply invested in the idea that advertising works (i.e. a company's advertising/publicity department). They can't go into a meeting and say \"Actually, advertising doesn't work\" because then they are out of jobs, as well. The risk is much greater in the short/medium term that in economic downturns companies will look at where they can cut and that the advertising budget will be an obvious target to the extent that it probably doesn't work well and executives are smart enough to recognize the parts of a company that aren't contributing as efficiently to the bottom line.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "While I think the author has some points, there aren't any better options for spreading the word about your new product.\n\nA product won't sell if people don't know about it.

Even if your funnel looks like: 500,000 presentations of your content -> 2,500 click throughs (0.5%)  -> 6 purchases (0.25%), those 6 purchases could cover the cost of your campaign. The alternative is to skip advertising and hope that people organically discover your product. Organic discovery can work if you get lucky (e.g. have some popular media personality discover your product and talk about it), but it's rarely a strategy that works for a brand new business offering a brand new product.\n\nThe thing about online advertising is that no matter how ineffective it may be, if your competition is advertising, you have to advertise as well.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Other day I made a comment on reddit saying joining the military isn't really a great idea.

And DTC brands (who tended to be some of FB’s largest customers) are also moving further into selling at big box retailers (look at Peloton in Amazon now) so I think that is taking ad dollars from traditional digital ad networks and shifting them somewhere else rather than that budget disappearing altogether.
