{"title": "10-19-22 SPY/ ES futures, Apple and Tesla Daily TA", "selftext": "I believe a lot of people after Netlfix had the massive beat and rip after hours yesterday that with spy up almost 1% after hours that we would see a pretty green day. However, as I suspected futures called it with that gravestone doji yesterday and SPY with the hard rejection at 375 that we would see a retracement. Now the question is where do we go from here. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e64oqbpxvuu91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=150998e587a305bb672e5f55a753b682d0ddd8fd\n\nWe still have our phantom print down at 357 that needs to be filled at some point and until something bigger or better than that shows up I have no reason to suspect that we don’t fill that this week or next. \n\nWe did break that v bottom recovery line and now are forming a nice falling wedge that gives support down at the 340s for this/ next week. \n\nThe biggest bullish case here is that SPY did hard bounce off its daily 8ema and hold that support well. We once again saw a massive fight happening at 368.7 today and we did end up barely closing below it. As I was saying above 368 and until 378 is broken I would be looking for downside to retest that 356 to 360 area. 360 remains my next target and with Tesla missing earnings we should see that happen tomorrow or the next day. \n\nKey support- 363.9 -> 359.9 -> 356.5\n\nKey resistance- 371 -> 375.2 -> 378.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/akiqrx5yvuu91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1de48f4847f1df6746be071959dea8642153a4ed\n\nTaking a look at futures here we can see a break through of the V bottom support and as of now we are rejecting that daily 20ema level. Overall I am seeing continued evidence of downside. The one thing I do want to see in order to believe in a retest of that 3585 level is that we break through and close below 3680 support tomorrow. That was a key bounce area today and a key previous resistance level. \n\nSupport- 3680 -> 3586\n\nResistance- 3760 -> 3805\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m3vvezkyvuu91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d940d05fbfbbfd2f28b20383894c367d218a52b\n\nApple overall doesn’t look terrible, but we saw once again a rejection of that key 143.8 level today and we saw a retest and rejection of the daily 20ema which should lead to more downside. \n\nWith Tesla missing on earnings due to a beat of expectations but revenue short fall (I wish I could listened to the call to see what he had to say) I do wonder with Apples report of Iphone 14 production cut and now this tesla earnings if we see that trickle down to the rest of tech who reports next week. \n\nKey support- 141.6 -> 138.2 -> 135\n\nKey resistance- 143.8 -> 146.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7txp5t0zvuu91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1431ed8bcf41b0dcf8b3ec448fddf15dd9870e31\n\nI had been saying pretty much all week that I expected tesla COULD beat earnings but give poor guidance which would result in a sell off and well that’s pretty much exactly what happened today. I was actually even more bearish on earnings today seeing yesterdays massive rejection followed by the daily 8ema rejection… its funny how the markets “know” when to not go too bullish ahead of time…\n\nI will be watching key 205 support the most tomorrow and the rest of this week. If and when that support is broke/  closed below that is when I suspect tesla could start its descent to the 180s. \n\nKey support- 219.6 -> 205.8\n\nKey resistance- 223.6\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7zcij0c0wuu91.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=8156d07d41b57897d8dd149dc57f5f79ab1fdb62\n\nThe VIX once again gave us zero direction and zero guidance of what to expect. The biggest thing I am noting is that the fear in the markets is not unwinding. To me that means we are not quite read for the next wave up. \n\nI zoomed out a little bit so we could look back at the June bottom. If you see there is quite the difference between the two times. Once that June 16th 52 week low was in the VIX had already “peaked” and already was on its descent down. The touch of the VIX on June 16th had a huge wick and after that it was a straight sell off. \n\nThe biggest difference is that on the current VIX trend is that we put a new low in on October 13th and about 1 or 2 days before that we “peaked” however we are not seeing the same level of sell off now that we did then. And the overall downward resistance line from that peak was broken today. \n\nThe VIX is still holding that 20ema support and we are still in that danger zone of 28.4 to 33. I struggle to be truly bullish that the “bottom” is in and that we are going on a big rally until I see the vix break through that 28.4 support range. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cnkx3kz0wuu91.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cfb90c112983a7c0f11f63aac0538642e756940\n\nOverall actually kind of a tough day to trade today. The biggest issue of the day was the IV and IV rank was so high from the previous day that the movements yesterday that were paying out an east 10-25% gains were barely paying 5% before it turned against you. It actually was very interesting to see how the premiums were moving today. \n\nA few times I noted in one specific Call play I was in that the price of SPY had fallen and fallen a decent amount where I definitely should have had my 20% stop loss hit, however, with the drop in SPY my call actually rose in value. Then once SPY did bounce my actual premium barely increased in value. It was almost like the actual movement of premiums was happening before the actual movement of SPY happened. I definitely caught a few plays where the technical setup of them looked perfect, however, caught a rogue bounce that stopped me out before I was able to capitalize. Overall a green day so no complaints but definitely a tough day to trade today. \n\nYoutube will be up soon!", "id": "y8j9wj", "created_utc": 1666226064.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Options pricing is through the roof. 350 here we come.

The bubble burst was in Feb of 2021 for covid winners, and we’ve been selling off ever since then. If you look at the run up of the stocks, the drawdowns have seen similar moves in terms of price levels for support/resistance.\n\nPTON was the first stock for me where I was quite certain the bubble was bursting. The base before the massive pandemic price explosion was around 55 a share and that’s the move you saw after earnings in November 2021 when it became clear it was a pandemic story. Of course one could argue the base was more like 40-60 which is where the drop went. Anywho, I didn’t actually do any TA on that one but some fundamental analysis I did made it clear that the company was headed towards bankruptcy in 2023. Still, trading is a hard game and I actually left the short position about three weeks or so before earnings. I made no money. \n\nWhich brings me to apple - if you look at the covid run up in price to the ultimate peak of around 182.01 you can see there are three blow off tops (relative maxima) before drawdowns. They are at around 156.69, 143.16, and 134.18.\n\nWe reached a top at 182.01 in Jan of this year, and have subsequently made three lower highs including that 182.01 peak - the other two are 178.96 and 174.55. If you look at the relative ratios of the peaks on the way up and down, you can get a ratio of 1.3. For example, 174.55/134.18 = 1.3. \n\nFor apple, it broke out during the pandemic from a base of around 90-100. You can choose 92.61 as relative minima and multiply by 1.3 to get a price target of 120.39 after earnings. That would be apple retracing the pandemic breakout level. I’m not sure why one would have to multiply by the ratio of the relative peaks, but probably there could be a mathematical argument.\n\nI’m not sure if what I wrote above is nonsense or not.

{"title": "Elon Musk has a huge gift for Tesla investors, do you think this will win the market over?", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nTesla plans a share buyback program between $5 billion et $10 billion for 2023.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nElon Musk took out the carrot. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe CEO of Tesla  (TSLA)  tried on October 19 to reassure the electric vehicle maker's shareholders after a completely disastrous first half of October for Tesla shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla shares have lost 16.3% since September 30, which translates into a decline in market value of approximately $135 billion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe decline is likely to continue, given the group's mixed results in the third quarter and cautious forecast for the whole of 2022. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"As we look ahead, our plans show that we're on track for the 50% annual growth in production this year. Although we are tracking supply chain risks, which are beyond our control,\" Chief Financial Officer Zach Kirkhorn told analysts during the earnings' call. \"On the delivery side, we do expect to be just under 50% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end of the year .\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe added: \"This means that again, you should expect a gap between production and deliveries in Q4. And those cars in transit will be delivered shortly to their customers upon arrival to their destination and Q1 \\[of 2023\\].\" \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla should therefore produce nearly 1.4 million vehicles in 2022 and deliver over 1.4 million units. It would be a record in both cases, but the firm had hoped to deliver 1.5 million vehicles in 2022.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n'Meaningful Buyback' Tesla posted a third-quarter net profit of $3.3 billion on revenue of $21.45 billion, the company said on October 19. Despite a 56% increase, revenues came below the $21.96 billion anticipated by analysts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFaced with this avalanche of not very reassuring news, Musk pulled out the bazooka. Indeed, the whimsical CEO indicated that Tesla had discussed a massive share buyback program, intended to remunerate the shareholders by boosting the share price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis share buyback program would be between $5 billion and $10 billion, the tech tycoon told analysts during the earnings' call.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"We debated the buyback idea extensively at board level,\" Musk said. \"The board generally thinks that it makes sense to do a buyback. We want to work through the right process to do a buyback. But it is certainly possible for us to do a buyback on the order of $5 \\[billion\\] to $10 billion even in the downside scenario of next year. Even if next year is a very difficult year, we still have the ability to do a $5 \\[billion\\] to $10 billion buyback.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe added that it \"is obviously pending board review and approval.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe tech tycoon, however, seems optimistic that this will be done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n“So it’s likely that we will do some meaningful buyback,” he concluded.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe announcement also comes a few months after Tesla carried out a stock split. In recent days, investors have been speculating about a buyback on Twitter where Musk is very present.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Tesla is having PE ratio compression that can be solved only by buyback and/or by 2x earnings increase,\" a Twitter user suggested on October 3.", "id": "y8lajb", "created_utc": 1666231562.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|18|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=y8lajb)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=y8lajb)\n    \n>TL;DR: Tesla plans a share buyback program between $5 billion and $10 billion for 2023.
