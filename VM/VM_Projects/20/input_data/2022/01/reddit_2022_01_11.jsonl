You want put strikes with a LOT of volume, MORE than 200k puts. Better yet, more than 300k. You should be able to look at the options chain and see the wall where volume drops off significantly. Then, yes, when the strike goes itm, you watch for VIX to roll over and go long. Oldfngguy is more about selling puts. This is a better risk management strategy, especially if your ultimate goal is accumulation and those puts are cash secured, but it takes a bankroll that most people do not have (selling ONE atm put puts you on the hook for at \\~$39,000 right now if exercised). Also, though, selling puts gives you premium to spend on hedges to further manage risk if things turn south. You can buy long calls and be successful, too; but, you're at the whim of the market, and options prices can move against you very fast - best to have a profit goal and hard cut-loss rules in this case, esp if you have a small bankroll. I don't know how much money you're planning on trading, but honestly, if it's only a few thousand dollars, you're probably going to lose it all if you trade long options - it only takes one bad trade to blow up that kind of account. Been there, done that, paid the options hard knocks education tuition, got the T-shirt and the shit-stained underwear, and am thankful it was only a few thousand when I was much younger.

The next target is $200, but at the moment, with the spread of interest rate hike expectations, the possibility of a short-term continued upward breakthrough is somewhat small, but in the long run, nothing can stop Apple from continuing to be great at the moment, and new rivals have yet to take shape.\n\nSince Huawei was restricted last year, Apple basically has no rival in the international high-end machine field, or is in some degree of monopoly status. People who don't have money want to buy Apple, and those who have money simply don't consider other brands. The latest data shows that Apple's cell phone has been ranked first in China's market share for two consecutive months, and is the leading sales, so you can think about the price of Apple's cell phone can be almost a dozen two start. The phone is not all of Apple's products, but definitely one of Apple's most capable products, especially now there is no decent competitor, a large share of the cell phone market, very conducive to the future Apple to carry out a series of intelligent products layout\n\nFor example, many people buy Apple cell phones, they began to slowly buy Apple family bucket, first buy a headset, and then buy a tablet, and finally found mac is also quite good, a set so slowly together, plus Apple cell phones are relatively durable, so this product retention cycle will be relatively long, although Apple cell phones really also have a lot of imperfections, but look at the current Android phones, but also do not I don't know what to say, even Xiaomi built-in anti-fraud app was pushed on the hot search, can't see Xiaomi's series of magical operation.\n\nAbout Apple's products, can not be said to be the best, but through the entire ecological construction, can provide a unique experience, and because of the ios super large-scale ecology, more software manufacturers are willing to Apple more optimization, Apple has a very strong voice, direct point to say, this is not a monopoly which is what, the most critical small manufacturers have no say at all, so buy such a stock, in addition to the rise of Slowly, but the probability of making money is still high.\n\nAnd, Apple through excellent product construction, has become more like a consumer stock, look at his valuation, where like a technology stock, coupled with a solid market share of growth and strong industry chain voice, this stock has really gained the attention of most of the funds, and even Warren Buffett is still a long position. Currently holding Apple is probable to outperform inflation. Even if interest rates continue to rise this year, but Apple's sales of cell phones have been related products sales probably will not be affected, and no one will suspect that Apple products increase in price can not be sold, right, take last year's Apple 13, even if the industry chain supply shortage, still with a year-on-year Apple 12 lower prices for sales, in fact, in order to gain greater market share. And the fact that many of last year's component costs are up.\n\nAt present, the impact of this year's interest rate hike on Apple's valuation is certainly not small, but in general, the greater impact on Apple's valuation is product power, if the product moat does not change, then the valuation is probably not too much worse, as long as the company is good enough, the decline is a better opportunity to get on board. If the rate hike continues, the valuation of many technology stocks will form a very large pressure, the disaster of growth stocks may have just begun, the funds in risk aversion considerations may continue to gather to the head of the company, and Apple may be one of the very solid head of the company.\n\nSince November the company's share price rose about 20%, put in the new year, as long as no more strong rivals appear, Apple is still one of the most profitable extremely, plus Apple is planning the electric car project, Apple's bottleneck probability has not yet appeared, after all, Apple is the ability to lead the trend", "id": "s18wf1", "created_utc": 1641892637.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "I’m dumb but rising interest rates make it harder for companies to get cheap loans for capx.

{"title": "U.S. stock forward: correction is almost over, now is a good opportunity to bottom?", "selftext": "Powell pledges for re-election: Fed will ensure high inflation does not take root in U.S. economy.\n\nThe U.S. Senate Banking Committee held a hearing on the nomination of Jerome Powell for a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve. In a speech prepared for Tuesday's Senate hearing, Jerome Powell said the Fed will prevent high inflation from becoming entrenched, while warning that the post-pandemic economy may look different from the previous expansion cycle. Powell further explained that the U.S. economy is growing rapidly and the labor market is strong. It is possible to begin to see that the economy may look different in some ways after a new crown epidemic, and pursuing the Fed's objectives will need to take these differences into account. To that end, the Fed's monetary policy must maintain breadth and foresight, keeping pace with the evolving economy.\n\nFed official: March rate hike may be appropriate, 3 rate hikes expected in 2022\n\nWith interest rate hikes inching closer and closer, market forecasts of a rate hike in March this year soaring to nearly 90%, it has almost become a nail in the coffin and Fed officials have come forward to take a stand. On Monday, Atlanta Fed President Bostic said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that interest rate hikes could be initiated as early as March, and that there may be three rate hikes this year, or even four, and that the balance sheet would begin to shrink \"fairly soon\" after the first rate hike to curb soaring inflation.\n\nBostic does not enjoy voting rights this year. Bostic said the soaring inflation and job market is very strong, and the Fed is expected to act in March. The current economy is still on a positive track, employment and the economy will continue to grow strongly, inflation will continue for some time, and price pressures are expected to moderate.\n\nThird case! Fed's second-in-command resigns after insider trading scandal\n\nFed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida will resign as a Fed governor this Friday (Jan. 14.) Clarida was appointed as Fed vice chairman in September 2018 for a term ending Jan. 31, 2022, and resigns this Friday two weeks earlier than his term expires. Shortly before Clarida tendered his resignation, the New York Times and Bloomberg had publicly questioned his stock trading in February 2020. Clarida sold three stock funds on Feb. 24, 2020, and then bought one back three days later when the stock market was in turmoil due to the new crown pneumonia outbreak. clarida filed revised financial statements last month, which the Federal Reserve said were omitted from its initial filing.\n\nFour rate hikes are just the beginning! Traders are already frantically hedging against a more aggressive Fed\n\nThe market is betting on a more aggressive Fed, and some traders may be hedging against the risk of five or even six rate hikes. Goldman Sachs recently raised the expected number of Fed rate hikes this year from three to four, and JPMorgan Chase even believes there will be more than four rate hikes this year. Bloomberg said that with market prices predicting an average policy tightening of close to a full 1 percentage point, some traders may be hedging the risk of five or even six rate hikes. In addition to that, options traders believe the Fed will raise rates eight times, 25 basis points each, by early 2024, up from previous expectations of about six times. Consumers have lowered their expectations for price increases in essential goods in the coming year. They now expect gasoline prices to rise 5.7% in the coming year, down from the 9.2% increase expected in November, and food prices to rise 7.8%, down from the 9.2% increase expected in November. Consumers' expectations for health care and rent prices remain unchanged.\n\nNew York Fed Survey: Consumer Inflation Expectations Unchanged at High 6% for Next Year\n\nU.S. consumers' short-term inflation expectations held steady in December after more than a year of steady gains, and consumers are more optimistic about the employment outlook, according to the latest monthly survey released Monday by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (New York Federal Reserve). The survey showed that the median consumer expectation for inflation over the next year remained unchanged at a high of 6 percent, still the highest level since the data was introduced in June 2013, and the expectation for inflation over the next three years also remained unchanged at 4 percent.", "id": "s1e9wf", "created_utc": 1641911646.0, "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Where's the ticker for this broski", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "And the TLDR, this shit’s like Homer’s Odyssey.
