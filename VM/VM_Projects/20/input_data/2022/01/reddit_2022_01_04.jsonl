It was a superior platform from the ground-up, but the market chose PC's and laughed Steve Jobs off the stage.  Go back to when the iPhone was originally released...no one took it seriously and deemed it \"too expensive\".  We were branded as \"fanboys\" and told to go play Oregon Trail because that's all Macs were good for back in 5th grade.  \n\nThe reality is that we were the adults in the room who realized a good product and company management when we saw it and the innate bias that the financial analysts (typically non-creative, business-types) had over this company.  In their minds, Apple is a beat away from doom and gloom.  You will see this at the next \"misstep\" and how hard and fast AAPL gets unloaded.  When iPhone growth \"peaked\" a few years ago, you could just tell it was the moment they were all waiting for.  The inflection point of Apple's demise.\n\nAs I've said in other posts, look at the P/E history for this company for the past decade and you'll see throughout its growth to being the most valuable company by far, it rarely ventured above 20.  It was treated as a value stock and the market completely misunderstood Jobs and his vision, and it's carried forward through the phenomenal Cook years.\n\nI also blame the accounting rule somewhat too.  The handset revenue has to be recognized over two years, which mutes the EPS that everyone relies on but rakes in the cash flow, which is why Apple amasses so much cash relative to the stock's P/E.  It's a cash cow.\n\nTo us, yes, the stock should be at $4T or more...pick a number.  But the market makers aren't going to let us get there easily.  Tesla, on the other hand, gets a P/E of 370 after becoming profitable for a few quarters.

Based on valuation, MSGS shares could be selling at a huge discount to its actual value of assets.\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-\n\nFor the first time ever, a National Hockey League team is valued at $2 billion in the annual valuation rankings from Forbes. Here‚Äôs what the valuation estimate and recent acquisition activity in the space could mean for the owner of the Rangers, which is publicly traded.\n\nWhat Happened: The average National Hockey League team saw a 32% rise in its value assigned in the annual Forbes rankings. The average NHL team is worth $865 million in the new rankings.\n\nThis marked the biggest one-year average gain to the average NHL valuation by Forbes since a 50% gain in 2012 when a new Canadian market television deal was signed.\n\nLeading the NHL team rankings is the New York Rangers, valued at $2 billion. The valuation of the Rangers was up 21% from the previous year and marked the first time a team was valued at $2 billion.\n\nCredited with the increase in valuation changes were several recent team sales and a rise in league revenue.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins recently entered a deal with Fenway Sports Group for a $900 million purchase price, or around 4.5 times expected revenue for the current 2021-'22 season. Prior to the deal, the average multiple was around four times revenue, according to Forbes.\n\nDeals for the Carolina Hurricanes (2018), New York Islanders (2016), and Arizona Coyotes (2014, 2019) were done at multiples of 3.9, 4.2, 3.3 and 3.0, respectively.\n\nLeague revenue is increasing thanks to media deals. ESPN, owned by Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) and Turner, owned by AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) signed new deals that started this season paying the NHL an average of $625 million a year. The previous U.S. media deals from ESPN and Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) unit NBC paid an average of $300 million annually.\n\nThe league reported hockey-related revenue of $2.9 billion in the 2020-'21 season. Revenue is expected to be $4.8 billion in 2021-'22 and increase to $6 billion for the 2025-'26 season.\n\nRelated Link: 8 Stocks To Watch For The NBA's 75th Anniversary Season\n\nMadison Square Garden Sports: The Rangers are owned by Madison Square Garden Sports Corp (NYSE:MSGS), a publicly-traded sports holding company. Madison Square Garden Sports owns the Rangers, the New York Knicks (NBA), Westchester Knicks (NBA G League), Hartford Wolf Pack (AHL) and esports assets such as Counter Logic Gaming and Knicks Gaming, which is in the 2K League owned by the NBA and Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO).\n\nThe latest rankings from Forbes break the Rangers down at $468 million for sport, $893 million for the market, $309 million for the stadium and $330 million for the brand. The team‚Äôs iconic Madison Square Garden Arena is owned by Madison Square Garden Entertainment Corp (NYSE:MSGE).\n\nThe Knicks were valued at $5.8 billion in the latest Forbes rankings, up 16% from the previous year. The valuation is broken down as $2.0 billion for sport, $2.5 billion for market, $403 million for the stadium and $918 million for the brand.\n\nTaking out the value of Madison Square Garden Arena and the Rangers are valued at $1.7 billion. The Knicks would be valued at $5.4 billion without the stadium. There could be some additional overlap between the values of the teams being owned together.\n\nUltimately, the two iconic New York teams are valued at $7.1 billion without their stadium.\n\nMSGS shares trade with a market capitalization of $4.2 billion and an enterprise value of $5.3 billion.

The working theory in our industry is that utilizing haze during shows should help mitigate Covid. The idea is that masks work in crowds because they push air up instead of out. When they hit the moisture droplets contact with the glycol they become heavy and begin to fall to the floor. As any tech knows you have to continuously pump haze into a room to keep the effect happening because it is literally sucking moisture out of the air.
