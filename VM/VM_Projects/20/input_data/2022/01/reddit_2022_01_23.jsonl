{"title": "How Much A Tesla EV Costs in Materials Alone", "selftext": "Hey guys, so I've been trying to pinpoint.. in the future, when battery costs are minimal, and Tesla has created a $25k car (which we all know will be at least $30k+ to the consumer because of inflation and demand), how much will those cheaper EVs cost to make? This is in \\*materials alone\\*. I'm not referring to superior manufacturing processes such as giga casts, or even the saved money from the 4680 line.. strictly physical materials.\n\nSome of you might remember my model:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yerM-7MbkDsPrCGm5CaIMOKYX3x7wNA4IH0823rdhns/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yerM-7MbkDsPrCGm5CaIMOKYX3x7wNA4IH0823rdhns/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nTo summarize how it works (will answer questions if you have them):\n\n1) known numbers in black\n\n2) extrapolate ASP, COG per EV\\* and operational costs per EV using exponential decay\n\n3) find earnings\n\n\\*this, the COG per EV, is the number in question. In cell R3, I estimated that the future COG per EV. i.e. physical cost to manufacture an average EV would be $15k, but as I've explored it more.. I'm having a hard time seeing the COG per EV decay down towards $15k. So what should that value/asymptote be? So here's a breakdown of the last quarter (these numbers are known.. not projected)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||ASP|COG per EV|op cost per EV|earnings per EV|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2021 Q3|$49,948|$34,713|$6,611|$8,622|\n\n(notice that ASP = COG per EV + op cost per EV + earnings per EV, in case you're wondering how those fit together)\n\nI recall that battery costs have reduced to about $100/kWh as of this year (someone correct me if I'm wrong, maybe they've been about $150/kWh last year?), and assuming that the average EV is about a 75kWh pack, we can break down this COG per EV:\n\n$34,713 = $7500 batteries + $27,213 \"everything else\"\n\nwhere everything else is the motor(s), interior, exterior, glass, leather/cloth, touchscreen, etc. I also recall that battery costs might reduce to $50/kWh by end of decade, and assuming they're more energy dense per weight.. maaaybe the average EV could get by with a 50kWh pack, so the \"$7500 batteries\" could diminish to $50\\*50= $2500 batteries, and that's a $5k off COG per EV at best.\n\nSo what about the \"everything else?\" Any ideas on how we can estimate this cost coming down? Just a guess of getting it down to $20k via lesser quality parts, added with $2500 for batteries would still have COG per EV at $22.5k. That's significantly higher than my previous guess of $15k, and it would drastically change my model's earnings numbers.\n\nAny help is appreciated, and will help my model spit out more accurate numbers", "id": "sb3c75", "created_utc": 1642970563.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Just scale down.

This means that the variable costs (which materials are a subset of these costs) were 58% of ASP, i.e. $29,000. These variable costs aren't only materials, as each supplier adds their own costs along the chain. If Tesla internalises a supplier, the suppliers cost structure is spread across Tesla's. By using gross margin you're effectively double counting depreciation/amortisation.\n\nIt's hard to measure exactly what raw materials cost, and even what are those costs? Resources are free, the only cost is human labour. For example, what if 20% of the cost of nickel was energy costs. If Tesla halves the cost of energy, then Nickel becomes 10% cheaper. Your model completely ignores these second order impacts.\n\nYou're also using the cell cost of a battery, not the pack cost. Battery is still a disproportionate cost of the vehicle. Of the 29k cost, I wouldn't be surprised if the pack was still 8-9k. Remember, the Model 3/Y is still an architecture that was largely designed in 2015-2017. Tesla's net generation Model Y + 4680 and structural pack will reduce COGS much faster than the linear rate of improvement since 2017.\n\nAsk yourself, if an EV is actually cheaper than an ICE after ignoring the battery pack and fuel tank, then why would you project the cost of building a Tesla ex-battery? You would look at the cost of a normal sedan, and then add a battery pack. This answer is likely to be conservative, and doesn't require some complex modelling of future cost declines etc. First principles says that other than the battery an EV should be cheaper. So the cost of the battery is really the key part of the model, not the projection of the cost of the body/factory etc.\n\nEach year EVs will go further, with less kWh. This is because right now still 95%+ of the supply chain is still geared to produce ICE components.

This seems likely though, right? You mentioned about a $29,000 variable costs per EV (not depreciation) via your calculation of contribution margin.\n\nIt's important to understand that every cost is 'variable' in the long term sense. It's only variable or fixed for a specific production range. For example, lets say Fremont has an upper capacity of 500k. If they are producing 450k, they could produce 50k more without any additional 'fixed costs'. If they want to produce more, they need to have more 'fixed costs, i.e. building another factory'. You can see how the 'fixed costs' are actually variable after 500k, but it's like they are variable in 'chunks'.\n\nThere are ways you can reduce the variable costs of a product. Improve defect rate, reduce material, better engineering etc. The 4680 + structural pack is an example of how to reduce variable cost per vehicle. You have a better car for the same price.\n\n29k is the current variable costs (roughly). This should continue to decline in real terms as they become more efficient generally. Scale brings even variable costs down. They also have the ability to vertically integrate more components, e.g. the cathode, this will then split the 'variable cost' of that component into fixed and variable costs. Giving them more 'room' to improve their economies of scale. Note, it's not automatically good to vertically integrate, it really only makes sense when you can be better than your supplier. \n\n>And lastly.. am I deducting depreciation twice in my model? If yes, then how?\n\nI'm not sure, but the way you were doing it before was scaling all costs like variable costs when in fact some were fixed. Think about it more from the asset base perspective. To produce the Model 3 in Fremont they need XYZ assets. If those assets are underutilised, you can reduce COGS per unit solely by fixed cost scaling.

Better mortgage just closed their broker channel and layed off part of their entire work force. Other lenders are doing the same. These two sharks are going to gobble up the smaller fish while rates go up. And out the other side they will both be fat Jaws sized monsters once rates go back down. \n\nWhen will that happen. I think sooner than the markets thinking. Markets currently pricing in 4 to 5 rate hikes. Am not as convinced that will happen given the rate at which we are seeing the economy slowing down. I think once we see the first hike. The fed and Biden are going to be like crap we need to keep the printer rolling to stop this upcoming recession. Netflix was the bellwether things are slowing down. \n\nAlso from watching several YouTubers they have also confirmed ad rates are down massively. I have a hard time believing Google will hit earnings but we will see. Papa Musk also is calling for a recession in the summer. The mans 4d chess smarts and I think he sees what’s coming as well.\n\nSo more pain in the short term but once the fed chills out we will see a rally and if things get really bad a rate cut and guess who’s going to be first in-line to make a crap ton of cash RKT and UWMC.  My prediction is by the end of the year we get a rate cut after it’s raised once maybe twice. Am long RKT and UWMC.  \n\nApe man do your own research.", "id": "sag8tn", "created_utc": 1642897003.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "Been burnt by both.

We will likely bounce here and there but yes, I am calling a  major correction/recession.\n\nSpent 2 hours on this to show how fked we are - rates may be eyeballed as I referenced bar graphs\n\n**TLDR: Fed's basically BRRRR'd and left the overnight/interest rates at rock bottom lows (opps?) creating the biggest asset bubble we have ever seen in the entire history of mankind and mind-numbing inflation.**\n\n[SPY monthly chart - with commentary](https://invst.ly/x6shz)\n\n[SPY monthly - 1974 - Jan 2022 \\(48 years\\)](https://preview.redd.it/j80ngysj5dd81.jpg?width=1858&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1bc040dd32a9b4ee7b5ef6730f0f24fb09cdf550)\n\nEV bubble:  TSLA and EV is probably the biggest bubble from what I can tell and Elon managed to sell the top. EV cars is like gas cars back then but never commanded a huge P/E. Cars are utility, goes A-B. When people see through that self driving tech is a decade away (prob due to city infrastructure to support self-driving and political red tape \\[nobody is rushing to have a self-driving car\\]), we can see some downside or relatively flatness or bearish on it.\n\nReal estate - bubble.... everywhere... Cheap money borrowed from the Feds. Canada's YOY RE prices has gone up 27%. There is no supply issue because we had this supply issue pre-pandemic but we never popped 27% in a single year or even close to it. People are balls deep in mortgage payments, and those who got in late is even more screwed.\n\nmetaVerse - a pandemic by product - too early to tell how to monetize this space. You can tell companies have been doing this, CS GO - skins, Diablo 3 - marketplace. These have not taken off in any dramatic way so we can gauge consumer sentiment to spend money in a virtual reality.\n\nAI innovations- this would be deflation.\n\nSPY top holdings are BIG TECH. Big tech was the major theme of the pandemic hedge which ended up being great winners. Re-opening is a negative for all these companies and the pandemic is basically over after this year.\n\nThe thing trading at 35k right now. This that have no value, is speculation. Speculation ends up being a bubble. EVEN if this thing is the next best thing, we are too early. All this cheap money finding new ideas to generate an ungodly P/L is basically, a matter bubble.\n\nWarren Buffett - ATH cash holdings. Going to wait out for the market to kick out the froth.\n\nChina - Imposing tons of new regulations to soften their markets, whether it be RE market (tax on developers), big tech (listing and fines, all regulations), ensuring the COMMON prosperity can continue (most China markets are/were already inflated before this initiative was introduced). China is basically a step ahead of the US Feds in controlling their economic cycles.\n\nRead this, [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/10/5-steps-of-a-bubble.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/10/5-steps-of-a-bubble.asp), then reflect on life around you, then read it again.

Usually this is overvaluation, it can be due to a bubble where p/e valuations for indices get out of control (like 2000), or it can be due to a recession (2008) where earnings will decrease because people have less money to spend (thus stocks become overvalued).\n2. need a systematic risk. without this, people's general attitude is that they want to buy the dip, even bears, they like the companies, or at least some of them, they just want to own them at a cheaper price. Real crashes come when people worry that there is no bottom, that all or most or enough of these companies are going to $0 at the same time. In 2000 this was the realisation that the dream of the internet had outstripped the ability of web 1.0. In 2008 this was because so many people were out of work most businesses struggled to get enough sales to stay afloat.\n\nCurrently we are not near a recession nor are we overvalued - this is difficult for some people to accept, but earnings ratios have been pretty stable since 2014 for both the NDAQ and SPY\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NDAQ/nasdaq/pe-ratio](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NDAQ/nasdaq/pe-ratio) \\- Stable since 2014\n\nSPY currently at about forward p/e of 23\\~ after yesterday, interestingly SPY DID get overvalued, but this was more due to the drop in earnings of a lot of value companies.\n\nThese are high, but categorically nowhere near a bubble. I do, however, think there were bubbles in SPACs - well and truly popped, cathie stocks - just about done popping now, and EVs & crypto - some air taken out but we're looking at you TSLA to let us know when it's sensible to buy any of these again.\n\nThere is also no systematic risk that I am aware of over the next 12 months russia ukraine is not big enough, china taiwan is not likely enough, new severe covid variant probable but likely can be well mitigated.\n\nAnything else without the above conditions is just navel gazing and waiting until enough people decide this price is low enough, and historically at an interest rate of 2% that has been round about the ratios above.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
