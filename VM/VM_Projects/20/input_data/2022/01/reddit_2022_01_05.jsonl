Unfortunate how the market performed while I was gone*\n\nThe stock market sank on Wednesday, pressured by a sell-off in technology stocks, as market participants digest the Fed‚Äôs latest meeting, which suggests an interest raise hike could happen ‚Äòrelatively soon‚Äô. As a result, growth stocks and technology stocks harshly pulled back. On the other hand, the Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a fresh intraday record high in the morning before slipping in the afternoon to close lower.\n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.92%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -3.07%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.03%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -3.39%\n* Tesla (TSLA): -5.35%\n* Roku (ROKU): -11.72%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): -5.96%\n* Microsoft (MSFT): -3.89%\n* Alphabet (GOOG: -4.51%\n* Rivian (RIVN): -11.22%\n* Block (SQ): -8.21%\n\nThe meeting minutes from the Fed‚Äôs December monetary policy meeting suggest the Central Bank was considering accelerating the timeline for a potential interest rate hike amid strengthening economic recovery and elevated inflation.\n\nThe meeting minutes said, ‚ÄúParticipants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated. Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve‚Äôs balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate.\"\n\nMoreover, the minutes said, ‚ÄúAlmost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.‚Äù\n\nHere is the entire meeting minutes: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf)\n\nTreasury yields jumped to build on gains after moving sharply higher on Monday and Tuesday, which had added pressure to technology and growth stocks. The benchmark 10-year jumped to a 9-month high following the release of the Fed's meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon.\n\nScott Kimbal, Co-Head of Fixed Income for BMO Global Asset Management said, ‚ÄúYields are moving sharply higher ... or in the very recent past, but they've been stubbornly lower when you compare them to what the inflationary talk has been. There's been lots of discussion about runaway inflation, the Fed being behind the curve. All of that would translate into a long-end ‚Äî the 10, 20, 30-year portion of the yield curve ‚Äî that's a lot steeper, or materially higher even in absolute terms than it is right now.\"\n\nThis morning, market participants digested a fresh upbeat labor market report, which showed private payroll gains handily beat estimated for December. ADP, a leading data processing company, that private-sector employers added back 807,000 jobs during the final month of November,  well ahead of the Dow Jones estimate for 375,000 and the November gain of 505,000.\n\nHiring was broad-based, though leisure and hospitality led with 246,000 new positions. Trade, transportation, and utilities contributed 138,000, professional and business services increased by 130,000, and education and health services added 85,000.\n\nWhile service-related professions led with 669,000 new hires, the goods-producing side also showed strong gains with manufacturing rising 74,000.\n\nNela Richardson, Chief Economist at ADP, said ‚ÄúDecember‚Äôs job market strengthened as the fallout from the Delta variant faded and Omicron‚Äôs impact had yet to be seen. Job gains were broad-based, as goods producers added the strongest reading of the year, while service providers dominated growth.‚Äù\n\n[https://adpemploymentreport.com/2021/December/NER/NER-December-2021.aspx](https://adpemploymentreport.com/2021/December/NER/NER-December-2021.aspx)\n\nFollowing the ADP release, Goldman Sachs raised its estimate for the December nonfarm payrolls count to 500,000, a 50,000 increase from its prior estimate.\n\nAs I have said multiple times before, I remain bullish until the Fed begins raising interest rates. Now that the Fed seems to be accelerating its timeline, it‚Äôs time to reassess. While I think the pullback the last two days is overdone, I do think market conditions are shifting. I remain bullish in the long-term but expect a lot more choppiness compared to the last two years. Trades should be quicker, with tighter profit targets and stops.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The Omicron variant continues to surge across the US, with the country once again recording a new record high. On January 4, the US reported 885,451 new coronavirus infections, more than tripling the peak of any of the previous surges.\n* Ford Motors (F) stock recently jumped more than 10% after the company announced it planned to double production of the electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck.\n* Ford also reported sales for 2021 fell 6.8% compared to 2020 but had a very strong fourth-quarter, a sign that demand could begin to pick up. Ford sold 508,451 vehicles in the fourth quarter, a 27% increase over the previous quarter\n* Meta Platforms (FB) has ceased development of a new VR/AR software operating system that employed more than 300 after four years. Meta quickly issued a statement via Gabriel Aul, its vice president of Reality Labs Engineering. \"There are several technical directions we're pursuing in our efforts to build the operating systems, we're still working on a highly specialized OS for our devices - we remain very much invested in this work and continue to dedicate the resources necessary to build this.‚Äù\n* GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told the annual CES technology conference via video on Wednesday that the electric Silverado will launch in two stages in 2023.\n* WarnerMedia‚Äôs HBO Max streaming service gained subscribers through the holidays, defying the slowing pace of growth at some rival services\n* WarnerMedia‚Äôs HBO Max streaming service gained subscribers through the holidays, defying the slowing pace of growth at some rival services.

{"title": "Apple is really a perfect ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù company!!!", "selftext": "Strong earnings and revenue growth year after year, without any ‚Äúfree year‚Äù.\n\nLet‚Äôs look on their numbers, from the time when legendary Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone to the public at the beginning of 2007.\n\nIt would be better to make some of calculations on a per share basis, like revenue and earnings per share. This will help neutralize changes in the stock base. If it‚Äôs shares dilution or shares buyback.\n\nRevenue per Share growth from Sep. 2008 to Sep. 2021  ‚Äì 14.62 Fold.\n\nEarnings per Share growth from Sep. 2008 to Sep. 2021 ‚Äì 23.82 Fold.\n\nYes it is really great results.\n\nLet‚Äôs look into the PS chart\n\n[PS 1997 - today](https://postimg.cc/6TtjfKTL)\n\n[PS 2010 - today](https://postimg.cc/vDhPPKVR)\n\n  \n\nThe PS moving inside the envelope from 2 to 4 for more than 9 years, and then going up more and more up to 8.4. What is singling the problem in valuation of the stock.\n\nLet‚Äôs see the numbers:\n\n|| Sep-2013 | TTM | Growth |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n| Price to Sales | 2.6 | 8.4 | 323% |\n| Revenue per Share | 6.552 | 21.691 | 330% |\n| Earnings per Share | 1.420 | 5.610 | 396% |\n| Month End Stock Price | 17.030 | 182.010 | 1069%|\n\n  \n\nSo when the Revenue per Share increased 3.3 times, Share Price had grown tenfold. It‚Äôs look like share price is disconnected with reality right now. PS difference of 3.23 is exactly the difference between the real stock price and overvalued stock price.\n\nBack to PS charts, last time it was so high when at Dec 2007 it was 6.54. But that time it was IPhone just released and it had a full potential for future growth. Today seems to that any new product coming from Apple.\n\nYes Apple is performing buybacks, and it‚Äôs paying dividends. But, buybacks started in 2013 with PS of 2.6 was a good idea. Prices to Sales is better metric for IT Company than regular Price to Book.  In regular, it is wise to perform a buybacks when PB is lower than 1, that time you are actually directly rewarded with hidden value. But not the story is about IT companies without regular infrastructure. It is better to look for PE or PS. And yes it was wise to buyback shares when it was 2.6. But it not a smart idea to do this when it 8.4. You are actually paying too much for the same business.\n\nWhat if to eliminate share buyback influence of per share data and look into the absolute numbers (mill. of dollars).\n\n|| 2013 | TTM | Growth |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n| Revenue | 170,910| 365,817 | 212% |\n| Market Cap. | 428,781 | 2,990,000 | 696.4% |\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo when the revenue grew only 2 times from 2013, the market cap is grew up 7 times more.\n\nIt is easily calculated, that with valuation from 2013 the market cap of Apple will be 909,016 millions of dollars.\n\nSo, what will be the possible share price of Apple? If Fed finally will stop printing money, one the possible valuation for Apple will be much lower than today. \n\nWith average revenue growth for last 9 years is 10.58% the possible valuation for Apple the next year could be 1,005,144.48. It could a possible best storm ever, when markets power will hit improper valuation of a lot of companies, it will hit also the revenue side of apple, and within this situation, Apple‚Äôs management will hold on of buyback program. As usual, buying stocks when it expensive, not buying when it is cheap. Buy high, sell low.\n\nAnd the real difference is from 2008 that is there is not any good product like IPhone going out right now. And it is really bad situation for all who believe that price of the Apple stock never will go down\n\nDo I bet against Apple? Never! It is still perform shares buyback and it‚Äôs paying dividends.
