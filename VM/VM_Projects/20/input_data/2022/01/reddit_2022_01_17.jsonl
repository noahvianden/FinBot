We are working closely with Visa on a potential solution that will enable customers to continue using their Visa credit cards on Amazon.co.uk,” the email stated.\n\n“Should we make any changes related to Visa credit cards, we will give you advance notice. Until then, you can continue to use Visa credit cards, debit cards, Mastercard, American Express, and Eurocard as you do today.”\n\nAlmost 90% of Britons shop at Amazon, and its analysts have estimated Amazon Prime membership in the UK to be about 21 million. Last month, it was claimed that Amazon faced losing nearly £1.4bn from UK shoppers had Visa credit cards been banned from the site.\n\nA Visa spokesperson said: “Amazon customers can continue to use Visa cards on Amazon.co.uk after January 19 while we work closely together to reach an agreement.”\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/17/amazon-and-visa-end-game-of-corporate-chicken-over-uk-credit-cards", "id": "s62be7", "created_utc": 1642420389.0, "score": 44, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "I kinda expected this would happen given that both Visa and Amazon would benefit from an agreement.

{"title": "Forecast: Is Netflix a surprise or a shock?", "selftext": "Last Quarter Review\n\nNetflix beat market expectations on several metrics for the third quarter of 2021. Netflix Q3:\n\nRevenue of $7.483 billion, up 16% year-over-year, in line with the Wall Street consensus of $74.8;\n\nNet added 4.38 million paying subscribers worldwide, beating Netflix's expectations of 3.5 million and Wall Street's expectations of 3.8 million.\n\nOperating profit was $1.755 billion, up 33.5% year on year, and net profit was $144,900, up 83.4% year on year.\n\nEarnings per share of $3.19 beat Wall Street expectations of $2.56.\n\nQ4 what to watch for\n\nSupported by the success of \"Squid Game\", Netflix's strong user growth in the third quarter is particularly noticeable, and whether the user growth in the fourth quarter can continue to be strong has also become an indicator that we observe. Despite the solid results, questions remain about the long-term outlook, especially as Netflix needs major games or content acquisitions to accelerate revenue.\n\nGiven the huge impact of new subscribers on profits at fixed content costs, subscriber size helps drive operational leverage. Netflix confirmed a 20% operating margin target and an average annual expansion of 300 basis points.\n\nSubscriber growth\n\nFirst, subscriber growth in the fourth quarter. The key metric rebounded in the third quarter after Netflix's second quarter subscriber growth was just 1.5 million consecutive. The 4.4m sequential increase in subscribers in the third quarter was the company's biggest subscriber growth since the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\nManagement blamed the slowdown in early 2021 on a high base in 2020, when many people were staying at home while staying entertained. But encouragingly, growth picked up in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nNetflix gave guidance for adding 8.5 million subscribers in the fourth quarter, with a net gain of 8.5 million subscribers putting the company back in its pre-CORONAVIRUS quarterly growth range of about 8 million to 8.8 million.\n\nNetflix may be able to meet its goal of adding 8.5 million subscribers in the fourth quarter thanks to stable content, but may not be able to achieve significant growth due to a slowdown in downloads in November-December. The company got off to a strong start, with Downloads in October reaching their highest level of 2021, but subsequent weakness led to a 6 percent drop from the same month last year.\n\nBut some analysts were more pessimistic.\n\nJpmorgan said Netflix's fourth-quarter subscriber numbers could be \"well below expectations\" and the total number of subscribers could be weak in the first quarter, cutting its price target.\n\nIn a research note, JPMORGAN analyst Doug Anmuth and his team cut their price target to $725 from $750, maintaining an \"outperform\" rating.\n\nAnmuth now expects to add a net 6.25 million subscribers in the fourth quarter, down from a previous estimate of 8.8 million and below Netflix's forecast of 8.5 million. For the first quarter, analysts are now forecasting a net increase of 5.5 million, down from a previous forecast of 6.5 million.\n\nResearch firm Stifel also lowered its price target on Netflix to $630 from $690 and maintained its \"buy\" rating. Analyst Scott Devitt noted that Netflix started seeing app engagement wane in November. Mr DeWitt is also concerned about \"expectations of slower user growth\". He also noted that recent price cuts in India could slow the company's profit growth in international markets. Despite these concerns, DeWitt believes the company executed well on its strategy in the fourth quarter.\n\nOperating profit margin\n\nAnother key metric Netflix investors should watch is the company's operating margin. One of the big underpinning factors for Netflix's stock strength is that profitability metrics continue to expand over time, despite some quarterly volatility.\n\nAs content production began to pick up, management guided for an operating margin of 6.5 per cent in the fourth quarter, down from 14 per cent a year earlier.\n\n\"The year-over-year decline in operating margin is primarily due to our major content launch schedule in Q4, which will result in approximately 19% year-over-year content amortization growth in Q4 '21 (compared to approximately 8% year-to-date growth),\" management explained in Netflix's Q3 shareholder letter.\n\nFor the full year, however, Netflix said it expected its operating margin in 2021 to be 20 per cent or more. That's a significant increase from the company's operating margin of 18 percent in 2020. Investors should look for full-year guidance from management to reach its 20% operating margin, with further improvement in 2022.", "id": "s61pk1", "created_utc": 1642418124.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "TL:DR\n\nNew subscribers info is all that matters \n\nNew subscribers is down or they wouldn't have raised rates again for 3rd time in a year", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "#So your saying yolo life saving on 0DE  puts Friday 1/21 right thanks 🤣", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Earnings is Thursday at the close 😂😂😂", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I know and I’m saying to yolo on Thursday into Friday puts 🤣🤣🤣🤣", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I've made worse decisions to make money", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Oh really do tell", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Its a sore subject", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Tl;dr\nIt depends on how much pinkie goes in.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yeah got to think the price increase has come because subscribers aren’t flooding in but this is a tricky earnings to play for sure", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "What if you straddle it?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I’m in Australia so sadly don’t get to play options.
