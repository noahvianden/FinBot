{"title": "$TWTR under $49 is actually a phenomenal deal (some comments on the Merger Agmt)", "selftext": "I know there are a billion posts on here about $TWTR, but I don't think there's enough discussion of the actual Merger Agreement, which to me shows that Twitter is a great deal.\n\nFirst the disclaimer: THIS IS NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE OR LEGAL ADVICE. I AM OBVIOUSLY RETARDED AND IF YOU LISTEN TO ME, SO ARE YOU.\n\nSome background (much of this you probably know):\n\nElon Musk is buying at $54.20 a share. Current price is below $49, and buying at $49 makes you a more than 10% return on your capital ASSUMING THE DEAL DOESN'T FALL THROUGH.\n\nThe risk of the deal falling through is why Twitter isn't trading at exactly $54.20 right now, in addition to the risk of having capital tied up.\n\nWe can see the Merger Agreement now (It's technically a merger for reasons that don't matter, but realistically, Elon is buying the company, so pretend it's just an acquisition).\n\nActually reviewing the agreement reveals the upside.\n\n* The closing is supposed to occur by October, so capital invested should be tied up for less than six months.\n* There are seven basic ways this agreement can fall apart.\n\n1. Elon and Twitter both agree to go separate ways.\n2. Elon materially breaches his obligations and Twitter decides to terminate.\n3. Twitter materially breaches its obligations and Elon decides to terminate.\n4. Twitter gets a better offer and takes it.\n5. Some government agency holds up the deal.\n6. The shareholders reject the deal\n7. It's just impossible to get the deal done and it's really nobody's fault, but it took way too long.\n\n* If a party is at fault for the deal falling apart, it (generally speaking) has to pay the other a billion dollars.\n* Twitter's obligations under this agreement are very pedestrian for a $44 billion deal. I've seen single digit million dollar real estate refinancing deals that are more cumbersome.\n\nSo out of the ways this deal can fall apart, we can basically rule out all but one. \n\nTwitter is not going to get a better offer (and if they did, that would be good, not bad, since we'd get a better return on the investment). \n\nTwitter is not going to back out of the deal. The board already agreed to it, which was almost certainly based on discussion with big shareholders. They've also clearly decided this is best for the company, and the idea that they would intentionally back out now makes no sense. \n\nTwitter also isn't going to screw this up. Their obligations under the deal are too minimal and the idea that they make the deal fall apart is very unlikely. \n\nRelatedly, a government agency is not going to block the deal, and it's not going to be impossible for this deal to be completed. Nothing is certain in life, but those two things are about as close to certain as it gets.\n\nSo we're left with basically one way this deal falls apart, which is that Elon screws it up. Right now, there are tons of stories out there saying \"Oh, Elon already breached the deal\" which are making investors more skeptical. That skepticism makes little sense. First off, Elon's tweets do not breach the agreement. If you read the words and think carefully about what he tweeted, you'll see that. The reporters who say otherwise are being sloppy. And even if Elon were tweeting in violation of the agreement, it's not realistic to think Twitter would actually back out of the deal on that basis. Are they going to pass on the deal of a lifetime because Elon said mean things about them? No.\n\nSo the deal can fall apart either because Elon changes his mind or somehow isn't able to get financing. Elon clearly isn't too worried about making sure \"i\"s are dotted and \"t\"s are crossed, because he's agreed to this merger agreement that is pretty easy for Twitter. To me, this shows that he really wants to own Twitter. \n\nAlthough people talk about scenarios where he uses a deal falling apart to turn a profit, that makes no sense. If Elon backs out, there is absolutely no way he makes money. He can't just sell Twitter for a profit right now without making SEC filings (which would tank the stock), and even if he could, based on his basis and the current trading value, he would lose money when you're factoring in the $1 billion divorce fee. While his financing could fall through, it would require a lack of creativity on his part. He has enough leveragable assets that he can find a way to buy Twitter. Even if Tesla poofed out of existence (which obviously won't happen), Elon's SpaceX value alone is more than $50 billion. As I said above, you can see from the way the Merger Agreement is drafted that he *wants* Twitter.\n\nSo while there are reasons to be concerned Elon will mess up or back out, they aren't really *good* reasons.\n\nLastly, if Elon backs out, he pays Twitter $1 billion, which is roughly 50% of Twitter's cash on hand and would represent nearly 10% of their assets by book value. $1 billion may not be a lot of money for Elon, but it actually is for Twitter. That's a massive cash infusion which will help the company.

{"title": "Lost on ARKK? Get it back.", "selftext": " What happens when a stock falls 90%? It falls 80%. And then it falls another 50%. This is bear market math. You can take advantage of it.\n\nIf you bought into the Cathie Wood dream and got hammered for it, it's not too late to learn your mistake and correct it.\n\nWhat are you buying when you buy ARKK? ARKK holds stocks that are long DURATION - the period of time it takes to receive cash flows. You are buying a leveraged bet on future cash flows of companies that mostly make no profit in the present. When unprofitable, ARKK-like companies need to finance themselves to continue their operations. They can do that by raising debt OR equity but NEITHER will be available in an environment of contracting liquidity that the Fed is creating. These companies either start to go bankrupt when they run out of cash OR they have to pay a very high price for financing that is terrible for their share prices. Inflation AND rising interest rates AND contracting liquidity are all BAD for growth stocks!!! The Fed hasn't even started selling bonds back into the market, the pain has hardly started. ARKK is going to keep getting fucked.\n\nCathie has largely been receiving inflows into her fund while the stocks that she owns in her fund have been dropping. What does this mean? The price of ARKK has actually been held UP by people continually purchasing ARKK! When investors actually begin to hate ARKK (as they WILL in an inflationary bear market), they will start redeeming ARKK en masse and ARKK will head lower than you ever thought possible. See how her fund's assets under management (AUM) has stayed constant while ARKK's return has undergone the FIRST phases of a Dotcom-bubble collapse here: [https://twitter.com/Keubiko/status/1517304541556920321](https://twitter.com/Keubiko/status/1517304541556920321)\n\n.\n\nThe solution: SHORT ARKK! It can easily be done by buying the inverse ARKK ETF. Whatever ARKK loses in a day (approximately), its inverse ETF makes in a day. The time for making money off of unprofitable growth companies will come again one day in the future. For now, you must know the market regime you are in. In an inflationary bear market with contracting liquidity, ARKK's holdings are not only going to get hammered. If the Fed breaks the funding markets several months from now and has to pivot on monetary policy, that will be a cue to go back into growth.", "id": "udyxgg", "created_utc": 1651163162.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|2|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/udyxgg/lost_on_arkk_get_it_back/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=udyxgg)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=udyxgg)\n    \nHey /u/ronaldstephens, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "ARKK : Survival Evolved", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "trying to tame the market using raptor jesus", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "She‚Äôs so fucking stupid.
