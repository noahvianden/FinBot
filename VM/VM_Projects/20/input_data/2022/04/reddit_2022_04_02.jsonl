However, the sheer inertia in oil and gas probably made it politically in-congruent to speak it. However, *because* of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the sheer cascading risk it then causes Europe *due* to Putin declaring on the world stage the thing that everyone knew but skirted or stepped over (that it's a rogue state where the leadership acts independently to the will of its people) because it was *convenient* to do so geopolitically. Putin has discarded his veil so to speak and its all out in the open that the man is willing to risk *potential* all out mutually assured destruction of the known world and billions of innocents within to satisfy his ego. This is even more damning because much of Europe's energy system is *tied* to that MAD quantification.\n\nThat inertia I mentioned earlier, Putin *inadvertently*, severed the hard line. What was politically inexpedient to say is now something Morgan Stanley can not only say, but scream off the top of every roof it has access to. They are bluntly declaring with those first two points that the use of oil as a measure of energy is directly tied to all out nuclear annihilation, and that the shift to batteries to convert existing energy means to store and discharge at scale is the *only* solution for the future. Anything *less* is a path *towards* ***extinction through a runaway war.***\n\nThen in the next points they illustrate the cost of this change, and their final point is that only 1 entity on the planet is aligned to drive this right now. To reinforce this point, they point out that the total TAM for this is $500Tn and of that only 1% has been spent. Basically \"you want to make money beyond your wildest dreams? Get behind THIS. There'll never been another opportunity in the history of our species like this for a long long *long* time.\"\n\nIt's about as bullish a statement as anyone can ever make. The only thing that's more bullish than this is FSD, the Bot, and Starship. Figuring out general world AI for FSD means that we're basically on the cusp of unlocking an Artificial Synthetic Intelligence (ASI) on the tech tree. From there, it's only a matter of time before we get to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). How does that happen? Moon and Mars. Starship, upon success, and over the next 30-50 years, through movement of hyperscale transport of goods and materials offworld, will facilitate colonization efforts of Moon and Mars. There, ASIs via Bots and humans with large scale data aggregation and management systems will be the primary drivers of everything. Where every nut, bolt, and gram of water or oxygen is tracked as realistically as possible--because there's no spares and giving up every gram of life support mass is suicide. Especially on Mars. The colonization of Mars will drive a revolution in hydroponics and aquaponics technologies. The next big disruption industry. Simultaneously, mining and manufacturing of materials off world for reverse transport is also ripe for disruption. There's certain materials you can mass produce on Mars more cheaply than you can on Earth with zero risk for pollution, because ***ironically***, polluting Mars with gases we consider toxic here is an actual GOOD thing. Why? Because Mars' atmosphere is 1% of Earth. Adding gas to the atmosphere over time will increase the density, which traps more heat, which blocks more of the hard radiation from the sun, which warms the planet, which unlocks water from the soil and melts some of the collated water-ice trapped around the planet. It's a positive feedback loop (of course I'm talking centuries timeframe here, but first step is needed for everything).\n\nThat's why Elon keeps stressing that the thing that takes up most of his brain power is FSD and Starship. Tesla's other missions have strong, very technical, and highly capable leadership already in place to run the company with successors probably out 3 degrees. Elon's still Technoking, but in theory if he was to step down tomorrow, Tesla can continue forever because they've crossed the 1% barrier (the bankruptcy wall, where most startups fall from and die rather than climbing over and having an infinite runway into success).\n\nSo the timeline for the next 30-40 years is this:\n\nTesla:\n\n* Storage > Batteries (4680 and successors) + Anode (Lithium, Nickel, Manganese, Silicon doping) + New Chemistry\n* Vehicles > Cars (general transport) + Trucks (specialized transport) + Semis (large scale transport) + Rovers (exploratory transport) + Mining Machinery (material exploitation and/or transport)\n* Energy > MegaPacks (currently) + GigaPacks (future) + PowerWalls + Solar (roof tile and panel efficiency tech for Earth, Moon, and Mars)\n* Sustainability > HVAC + eVTOL (potential) (especially important on Moon and Mars)\n* AI > FSD + Bots\n\nSpaceX:\n\n* Starship > Colonization + Hyperscale goods transport and reverse transport + science missions + eventual asteroid belt exploitation\n* Starlink > Hyperscale Data Transport Networks (Earth, Moon, and Mars)\n* Sustainability > Hydroponics/Aquaponics (colonization) + Water/Air/Material Filtering & Recycling (colonization/crew transport)\n\nSynergies:\n\n* Material Science > Gigacasting alloy (a result of SpaceX contract w/ Tesla)\n* Engineering > Carbon Wrapped Sleeve Model S PLAID Motors (a result of SpaceX knowledge cross-pollinated with Tesla which led to the use of aerospace materials in Model 3 Motors that allowed Tesla to run these at 20K RPM and deal with thermal expansion challenges, giving each motor absolutely bonkers torque)\n* Material & Parts Stress Data > Starship ailerons + SuperHeavy grid fins leverage Model 3 Motors & Battery Packs (giving Tesla and SpaceX unique data in usability, stress, and failure threshold not available to any other BEV company in the world)\n* Sustainability > Tesla HVAC & HeatPump tech (will play a vital role in Starship lifesupport in addition to SpaceX's own divisions) + GigaFactory Production (for building large scale systems with Moon, Mars colonization efforts that maximizes space, minimizes resource use and recycling of materials for reuse within factory scope)\n* Energy > Mega/GigaPacks + PowerWall + Solar (Moon/Mars), Autobidder for global use\n* ASI > FSD for Rovers, Bots, data aggregation, collection, ML/AI, direct democracy models as population off-world grows  \n\n\n***ALL***, a result of 1 man birthing these two companies who are intrinsically aligned with each other and the success of one begets the success of the other.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "“well, no shit ~~Sherlock~~ Stanley”", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Adam Jonas, the guy that predicted in 2019 Tesla shares could drop to $10.\n\nEverybody panicked, I bought a lot, and he made me a rich man.\n\nUnfortunately I sold half late 2019...\n\nHere is the famous article, predicting stupid things in China...\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/morgan-stanley-tesla-shares-could-drop-to-10-in-worst-case-scenario.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/21/morgan-stanley-tesla-shares-could-drop-to-10-in-worst-case-scenario.html)", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, by end of year I was already making 3-4x the investment, and I needed some money and thought the stock would remain stable for a while.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Like planting a tree, the best time to buy was 5 years ago, the next best time to buy is now.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Hmmm, that was his bear case though.

Now maybe with a \"risk-free\", government-guaranteed investment, a zero real return is acceptable. For anything significantly less than that, free market participants would likely instead choose gold or silver, which have for thousands of years maintained their purchasing power over long time frames. Another similar alternative is farmland. \n\nAssumption #1: at current prices, TLT is giving a -50% total real return to maturity.   \nAssumption #2: the natural total real return for bonds is 0%.   \nConclusion: TLT is overvalued by a factor of roughly \\~2x, and can fall by \\~50%.\n\nJust because something is a government bond doesn't make it a \"safe\" investment. Long-term gov bonds can lose a lot of value. A 30-year bond can be sold before maturity but there has to be a buyer. You can't \"redeem\" a bond for its principal before maturity. \n\nQE: the fed has been buying these bonds off the private market for the past 2 years with printed money and driving up their prices. With QE ending and QT starting, no more infinite money printing buyer will backstop this asset. The fed probably will not restart QE until inflation has cooled off significantly. \n\nNow you understand the TINA argument. No one wants to sit on these overvalued bonds. The problem is there is **always** an alternative: spending today on goods, services, or commodities, many of which can have long-term value. Another is short-term bonds, which don't have the same exposure to inflation. And finally, paying off debt. \n\nPosition: TBT 2024 calls\n\nSources:\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239454/ishares-20-year-treasury-bond-etf](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239454/ishares-20-year-treasury-bond-etf)\n\n\\[2\\] [https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator/consumer-price-index-1913-](https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator/consumer-price-index-1913-)", "id": "tu92w6", "created_utc": 1648869240.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|23|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|21|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpfxmh/why_biontech_bntx_will_moon_after_earnings_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qpg4hp/why_biontech_bntx_will_moon_after_earnings_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tu92w6/laymans_reasoning_for_why_tlt_is_overvalued/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/po3uzy/michael_burry_is_right_and_you_are_all_wrong_again/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q86s7c/yall_just_dont_get_it_do_you/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tu92w6)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tu92w6)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "But what if the fed transitioning from QE —> QT catalyzes a recession?
