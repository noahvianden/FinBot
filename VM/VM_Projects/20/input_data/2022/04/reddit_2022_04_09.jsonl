There is fierce competition, even in the digital banking realm. UPST for example, will probably eat SoFi's lunch in the long term as they have been breaking in the lending industry at a ridiculously high rate. There are other comps but UPST is worth a solo mention given their superior risk/reward metrics for lending which grants them more pricing power.\n2. **Not so \"conservative\" estimates** \\- Your projected net rev is higher than Bloomberg's estimates which to me, precludes your estimates from being conservative. These optimistic front year projections will boost your DCF derived value. Even if that's what mgmt is expecting, I would sensitize rev or apply at least a 10% margin of safety.\n3. **Share issuance** \\- I know the recent share issuance is mostly tied to acquisitions (which I think could have been executed at a lower price) but seeing as the company just IPO'd and already has a trend for issuing shares, I would personally apply a small increase in shares YoY to account for what I consider to be a real risk to investors.\n\nJust my two cents.
