Nvidia broke $340 and I don't even remember how high their P/E ratio was. (*edit: their P/E in Oct 2021 was 79*) The crypto market was breaking ATH's like crazy and their GPU's were selling like crazy.\n\nBy October 22 it almost dropped to $100 due to revenue decreases and macroeconomic conditions but it still bounced back to $160 within a month. That's not a bad jump.\n\nMy opinion:\n\nNvidia is a great company. They will definitely grow in the coming years and I expect the price to go up long term and maybe even break it's previous ATH if the economy recovers (which it probably will at some point). However, I'm bearish short term as I can see their revenue growth declining sharply mainly due to less demand for their GPUs and ofc due to recession. \n\nMy position:\n\nI'm short on Nvidia for a few days.
