{"title": "11-15-22 SPY/ ES Futures, and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Going to shy away from further TA on Apple. For me personally I don‚Äôt focus on it much anymore and I just don‚Äôt want to waste my resources on it when I have had a much higher success rate with Tesla and of course my GOAT SPY. \n\nToday we saw yet again another massive sell off. I am trying to decide if markets are truly that over extended that anything will cause a dump or if we are just getting truly rogue new waves causing a dump. The one thing i will say is that as low as the VIX is right now‚Ä¶ it sure shows signs it doesn‚Äôt want to stay there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfq05cbxt70a1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bceb8d88dc64a122111ae099429909bfb085c4f\n\nThe one thing that did happen today that is important to note even before that huge dump with the Poland ‚Äúincident‚Äù is that SPY had a massive pre market attempted to break out over the daily 200ema at open and then from there was stuck in a tight range and even before the Poland news broke it appeared we were looking at a bigger sell off EOD. \n\nNow SPY is faced with a nice daily 200ema attempt and rejection with a doji candle. So the question will be which should be answered tomorrow is‚Ä¶ did we just put the top in with that 200ema rejection or did we just reject to gather further support before we push through this major resistance point? I still remain indifferent here as I did note that the VIX was pushing up this morning even before the Poland news drop. So it could be that at these levels people are finally starting to put some downside protection back on. However, I do still think its too early to go long on puts here but I also think its silly to be long on calls here also.\n\nSupport- 398.5 (key pivot point) -> 395 -> 393 -> 390.1\n\nResistance- 401.9 -> 405.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ra3egbrxt70a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4e21b3fd3ae31ab341e4c2ca95dd267553b9660\n\nLooking at futures daily compared to SPY daily there is quite a bit of a difference in the daily candle structure. On Futes we actually see a really large wicked double top at 4002 gravestone doji. This to me is set up as a far more bearish indication then SPY daily shows. \n\nFutures has struggled now 3 days in a row to break through 4002 and most importantly to close over it. This is our key pivot level. If futures can close over 4002 then I do forsee a case for 4100. However, IF we reject or fail to retest 4002 again then I am looking for support down 3900. The key support level is 3965. \n\nSupport- 3965 -> 3925 -> 3900\n\nResistance- 4002 -> 4027 -> 4060\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n0neyc8yt70a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc52fdd5a93ed797457892c4d13fcb8a2e266bb3\n\nTesla had started out bullish in my opinion breaking through that falling wedge resistance and breaking over and holding over the daily 8ema for a while. I was actually bullish on Tesla thinking with this breakout we could see a run for the daily 20ema and possibly channel resistance at 208.8. However, we ended up loosing support and closing back under the daily 8ema. With the daily 8ema closed under I am seeing a very strong resistance at 196.1. Until this level is broken and the daily 8ema is closed over I do expect further downside or at minimum consolidation. \n\nSupport- 190.8 -> 185.7 -> 177.4\n\nResistance- 196.1 -> 201 -> 204.9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wwd8stizt70a1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=74f97e505024fa967801a45662891d8c2a460ce8\n\nWe did see a pretty nice breakout of this bear channel today on the VIX. The thing I noted and mentioned earlier is that we saw the VIX was holding 23.5 and was actually pushing up even before the Poland new hit the markets. With the VIX options expiration tomorrow its very possible that is why we saw this movement up. Or as I had mentioned with spy at 400/ spx at 4000 range now I do wonder if we are seeing people put their downside hedges back on. I mean it doesn‚Äôt take a brainiac to realize we are STILL in a bear market and things STILL aren‚Äôt that great in the economy and realistically no one knows exactly what JPOW is going to do next month at FOMC. \n\nThere still is a very real scenario where JPOW says 50 bps hike and hints at another 50bps next meeting in January. On top of that there is nothing saying after 5 consecutive decreases on the CPI YoY readings that we don‚Äôt get a rogue spike in CPI YoY that sends the markets tumbling. At this point with the markets now expecting a beat on CPI any miss is going to get bloody‚Ä¶ like historically bloody type of days‚Ä¶\n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t69kkk00u70a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8341e101162fcf735d9fe88cc69ad1529010dfb4\n\nGood day today. I was busy with my daughter and her birthday most of the morning so I wasn‚Äôt around to trade until about 1230‚Ä¶ hit that morning put scalp on SPX before I left. I came back in right before that massive dump from the Poland news and got burnt on some calls off what looked like a support bounce. After that did a few quick level to level plays but on huge reactions like that I don‚Äôt enjoy trading much and I also don‚Äôt trade during power hour much anymore besides the occasional too good to be true lotto play. So I was mostly cash. Still a green day but small at that‚Ä¶ \n\n**Daily Log-** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9uc4hpf0u70a1.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=b52cd9c2c507d1b018c563ceb68dd7c068249e9d\n\nI am very curious to see what the market is going to open at tomorrow. I heard there COULD be an emergency meeting with NATO to discuss more Russia stuff. I don‚Äôt know if there will be any further action as the narrative im seeing pushed right now is that it was an accident OR it wasn‚Äôt even a missile‚Ä¶ we probably will never know the truth. \n\nI did swing some Tesla OTM puts though based on that setup on the daily. I will take profits or take my loss at open pretty much regardless unless im seeing something different on my indicators/ the charts. \n\nThat‚Äôs the hardest part about swings is that I get a lot of questions before the market even opens of ‚Äúare you going to take profits at open?‚Äù ‚Äúyou going to take your loss at open?‚Äù and honestly until the market opens and until I see exactly what VOLD is doing and the overall moneyflow/ momentum and the DMI stoch and just the actual movement of the candles I have no way to know exactly what the plan is. The only time I for sure can say yes I will close at open is when I know I have a substantial amount of profits OR the move I anticipated clearly isn‚Äôt about to play out. \n\nYOUTUBE be up later tonight!", "id": "ywfr28", "created_utc": 1668562016.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|3639|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vwhw7o/how_to_trade_cpi_day/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v8vbnd/6922_spy_daily_ta_bonus_cpi_day_trade_breakdown/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xsd18z/93022_spy_es_futures_apple_and_tesla_weekly_recap/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5xtr/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uxvyrg/52522_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwdk8h/52322_spy_daily_ta_bonus_fomc_minutes_reaction_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w5k3q1/the_only_fomc_week_ta_dd_youll_ever_need_to_read/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vxkm5u/71222_spy_es_futures_daily_ta_and_cpi_swing_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/usqmwy/51822_spy_daily_ta/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ywfr28)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ywfr28)\n\nCheck out the [WSB Discord](https://discord.gg/Y6Zw9ZKYdx)\n    \nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: trading Apple is a waste of resources, VIX is showing signs of not wanting to stay low, SPY has a chance to break out over the daily 200ema but I think its too early to say for sure yet, Futures are facing a key pivot at 4002, Tesla is bearish until we can close over the daily 8ema and break 196.1", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">I predict that the market will continue to sell off tomorrow.", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "That‚Äôs all I needed to hear, thanks VM", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I got wrecked on my calls midday when the Poland event happened.
