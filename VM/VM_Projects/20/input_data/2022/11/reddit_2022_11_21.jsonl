If a lot of those options are owned by \"normal\" retail traders that don't realize they can still exercise after 4:00 EST, you may get lucky and you won't be assigned.  On the other hand, if the option market makers own the options you sold (calls or puts), and they can buy/sell the stock in the after hours and then exercise their option, they absolutely will.   Assignment is random, so you may still not be the person that gets assigned.  But my experience is that I have frequently been assigned a part of the position. \n\nJust do the mental exercise:  let's say you own a call on XYZ that expires today (Friday) with a strike of $10.00. The stock closes for the day at 9.95.  Bummer, you think, this contract is worthless.  Then, 5 mins after the market closes, XYZ makes an announcement that they've found a cure for cancer.  In the after hours, the stock goes crazy and quickly trades up to $20 - a 100% gain, and with a lot of trading volume!  As the call owner, you simply sell that stock (short) for $20, and now exercise your option contract, since you have until 5:30 EST.  You go into the weekend \"flat\" having made a huge gain on what was effectively a risk-free trade in the after hours!   Of course the seller of that option call will log into their account Saturday and realize that they are now short shares of XYZ, and that they sold them at $10 per the call contract that they sold.  On Monday, when XYZ is way up, and they're forced to cover for a big loss.  And yes, scenarios like this happen!  And even if XYZ reversed course and is back down - well, you the seller got lucky.  But the option holder, having done everything he needed to do on Friday afternoon - never took any risk whatsoever - the dream trade.\n\nNow... Everyone loves to say \"buy your option back before the market closes\" so you don't have to worry - and while generally speaking this can make sense for many options, lets not forget the fact that it costs at least $1 per contract to buy those contracts back, and sometimes much more than that if there are no buyers to be found at a quoted ask of .01.  The ask could be .05 or .10 (or much higher!) if no one is interested in selling late on an expiration Friday - especially market makers that fully understand the risk they take by selling contracts late in the day.  My experience?  I generally have to overpay to buy back options on stocks that are closing very close to the strike price.  You have to decide whether you think that stock will go against you in the after hours on Friday, which is not always easy to predict!   Sometimes I'm right.

Their above chart shows how average returns overall in the following 12 months are much higher if an investor waits one month until after the trough as opposed to investing a month before.\n\nAlso during that phase, initial recovery trends tend to be led by assets that have underperformed the most during the bear market phase. “This is what makes these transitions so difficult to navigate — the recovery when it comes tends to be swift and led by the types of companies that investors tend to avoid through the bear market.”\n\n“That said, this is ‘the trade after the trade’ and we think it is premature to be positioning for this now” said Goldman, urging investors to hold their horses.\n\nAs for right now, strategists are all in on a “barbell approach,” which means investing across the risk spectrum with the goal of getting a more even portfolio. Their mix consists of quality, strong balance sheet and stable margin companies, with deep value, energy and resources where valuation risks remain limited.\n\n“We like companies that can compound earnings and returns through a combination of reinvestment and dividends over time,” he said, adding that in contrast to the last cycle, they want more diversification across styles and regions and more emphasis on valuation, which should “enhance returns through 2023.”\n\n##", "id": "z12q4e", "created_utc": 1669046931.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.52, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Ah, the old \"you should buy so we can sell\" piece", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Isn't that every buy piece?", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Sounds like the expectation is for a challenging 2023 with a shift to optimism at some point.

{"title": "Buffet trades positions - BYD for TSMC. Is it really at a buying point?", "selftext": "**Buffet's latest position.**\n\nBerkshire Hathaway had just invested $4.1B in $TSM (TSMC), which translates to 60.1 million shares of Taiwan Semiconductors shares.\n\n**But why now?**\n\nWarren Buffet stock picking strategy is pretty straightforward - companies with optimistic long-term prospects, sound financial health and profitability, and relatively low price-earning (PE) and price-to-book (PB) ratios. With strong EPS growth, P/E at one of its lowest points since 2012, it seems TSMC's Q3 fall made it a good opportunity in the eyes of Buffet.\n\n**What about Taiwan-China crisis?**\n\nOne of the main risks of investing in Taiwanian companies these days is the ongoing geopolitical crisis between China and Taiwan. In TSMC's case, just 10% of TSMC’s revenue comes from China, while 50% is USA. This puts TSMC in a very good position against this crisis, as China needs TSMC more than the other way around. I can only guess Warren Buffet simply doesn't see China as a threat to the company.\n\n**Buffet trims 20% BYD for TSMC - What does it mean for the semiconductor industry?**\n\n20% of Buffet's position in $BYDDY , an EV auto company, was replaced with the new TSMC position. While many analysts believe Buffet's decision signals that he sees better prospects in semiconductors than electrical vehicles (EV), I believe Buffet simply sees the EV market as an overpriced market.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nMy take - TSMC is a great value investment. A profitable company that paid stable cash dividends over 2 decades, and it maintained growth momentum despite the current downturn in tech. No doubt what's holding this stock right now is the China-Taiwan war, resulting in fearful investors that keep the stock undervalued. The major risk here is if China decides to invade Taiwan, other than that, TSMC is at a pretty clear buy point.\n\n*I'm not a financial analyst, and this is not a recommendation.*\n\n**Adding** [my portfolio](https://www.jika.io/u/Crowman) **performance** just to give you a sense of my investment style\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3daibeirbb1a1.jpg?width=757&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3f8696481c6e19a7934896ecf94bf5719574ec0", "id": "z102te", "created_utc": 1669040232.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=z102te)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=z102te)\n\nCheck out the [WSB Discord](https://discord.gg/Y6Zw9ZKYdx)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": ">Thanks for the analysis.
