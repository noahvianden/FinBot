If it's unleveraged sibling is a safe bet over the longer-term, wouldn't buying it just be maximising your returns, with no real risk?\nObviously the risk is that if the market goes down, your unrealised losses are 3x greater. But I'm coming from the perspective of holding this stock for >5 years. \n\nAgain, maybe I'm missing something and open to being an idiot!\n\nTLDR; Why not just buy TQQQ instead of regular old NASDAQ or S&P.
