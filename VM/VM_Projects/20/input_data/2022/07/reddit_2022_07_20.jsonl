This is a classical rug pull, and many countries are very mad at the US for this.\n\n**The petrodollar scam**\n\nThe US scammed many poor countries out of trillions of dollars worth of oil. They launched the OPEC scam where poor countries are required to sell all their crude oil for USD and USD only. They forced many countries into adopting the petrodollar system. They even fought wars in Afghanistan and assassinated Obasma Bin Laden just to force poor countries with lots of crude oil into selling their crude oil for USD. Now they are fighting Russia since Russia refused to sell crude oil for USD. The FED can print as much USD as it want, literally giving them unlimited free crude oil.\n\n**The biggest stock market manipulation scam ever**\n\nThe FED planned every stock market rallies and crashes in advance. Their stupid monetary policies manipulate the economy in the FED's favor. If they want the stock market to crash, they raise their stupid interest rates and make everyone sell stocks and buy debt securities, and if they want the stock market to rally, they decrease their stupid interest rates and make everyone move to stocks since their savings paid VERY LITTLE INTEREST.\n\n**The inflation scam**\n\nWhenever the US government is short on money the FED prints money.

However, a number of energy market experts have expressed doubts since the plan was proposed.\n\n\"It's kind of a ridiculous idea in my view,\" Luft said in an interview on CNBC, noting that oil is a fungible commodity and that barrels of oil are basically interchangeable regardless of who is buying.\n\n\"That's not how oil prices work. This is a sophisticated market. You cannot force prices down. All it's going to do is cause the Russians to restrict their production,\" Luft added, speculating that Putin may retaliate against the price cap by taking more barrels off the market. \"Those Europeans and Americans talking about $40 a barrel, what they're going to get is $140 a barrel,\" he said.\n\nAlthough oil prices briefly dropped below $100 this month on recession fears, experts note the declines are likely temporary, especially as a European embargo on Russian energy supplies won't fully kick in until the end of the year.\n\nPresident Biden also left Saudi Arabia this week with no announcement of an oil production hike, leading IEA Chief Fatih Birol to call European nations to develop an emergency plan and prepare for a crisis event this winter.\n\nVia: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/russia-oil-price-cap-barrel-crude-western-sanctions-energy-supplies-2022-7](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/russia-oil-price-cap-barrel-crude-western-sanctions-energy-supplies-2022-7)", "id": "w3a9uk", "created_utc": 1658282932.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|83|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|490|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w3a9uk)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w3a9uk)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's not a price cap.

So all refiners that self-sanctioned will come back to market to buy it. Russian production will increase, but because it is cheap, demand will severely outstrip supply. So how to allocate?\n\n\nYou cannot. Buyers will cheat to get cheap crude which is still well below the alternative marginal barrel price. It will end up being those that pay most that get barrels. That price will be well above what Russia gets now and with the added volume. Russia makes more money.\n\nDo you think someone in the oil market will stick to a $60 cap, run the risk of not getting the oil and having to pay $110? Do you not think they will offer $80 or $90?

{"title": "RKT the Spanish Inquisition of meme stocks", "selftext": "Looking back at the GME and AMC runs of that last year. We can draw a few conclusions on why they worked. They blindsided the Hedgies because who in their right mind would invest in game stop? Digital downloads should be making game stop be irrelevant. Yet a hand full of smart people could see this was overblown and GME has growth and life ahead of it. AMC was all so declared dead by Wallstreet because of covid. \n\nI present you with RKT. Rocket mortgage. Right now Rocket been beaten to its knees with the rest of the market. Housing is been declared dead. Rightfully so most would add with rates going up mortgages slowing. Sound familiar, no one on Wallstreet wants to touch this company or retail for that matter. It‚Äôs how you can bleed a stock down over 50% from its highs. It‚Äôs when people are dead set on a companies doom that we have the most opportunity. Ask you self this, arnt we all cheering for the housing market to crash so we can buy a home ourselves. That demand for a home is why housing never truly dies. It will correct like any market but in the end of the day people want to own homes, go to the movies and go down to the game store to bullshit and buy the new copy of call of duty. \n\nThe other thing that GME and AMC had going for it was high short Interest and a small float. Rough estimates on RKT shot interest sitting at 31%. I say rough because as we know shorts have ways to manipulate this data. Shares are also hard to short at the current moment and expensive. \n\nLike GME before it‚Äôs squeeze the sellers in RKT have been largely exhausted. I can confidently say this by just looking at todays trading action. CNBC top page articles was about the slowing housing market. ‚ÄúMortgage demand drops to a 22-year low as higher interest rates and inflation crush homebuyers‚Äù and ‚ÄúJune home sales fall 5.4% from May, as prices set yet another record.‚Äù\nDespite these headlines RKT was up 1.6% as of me writing this. \n\nHow is this possible? Because of 3 things.\n\n1. We have reached a bottom in sellers. The people who bought this at 20 have either sold are now longs. \n\n2. The market is forward looking and like me a lot of people are starting to think we saw the peak of inflation. Gas is coming down a number of commodity‚Äôs have come down a lot very recently. Feds going to raise another .75 or a full point. The effect of which should bring down inflation further. If inflation chills out we can see the fed Slow down. Rates for home loans will follow suite. If and in my opinion when recession. Is declared on the as we creep close to an election. The fed will be hard pressed to remain hawks as the economy worsens. They would likely cut rates to bring back jobs. If the worst is behinds us when we have chill adjustment period with rates staying even for a while. Still much better for the housing market. RKT lender is the largest and has the most capital of all the mortgage players to take advantage when they rates turn\n\n3. COE and CFO have been buying the dip. They have been in the The mortgage business for over 30 years. They know how to play these cycles. 08 being a prime example while other mortgage lenders went belly up RKT took advantage of the carnage in the following years and 3 to 4xed the company to over take wellsfargo as the largest lender in the country. \n\nRKT to me is a rocket just waiting for buyers to trigger the launch sequence.", "id": "w3vdlg", "created_utc": 1658345877.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|103|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|209|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oc2ez0/why_rkt_will_and_should_moon/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q485mp/rkt_is_a_coiled_spring/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sag8tn/my_rkt_and_uwm_theory/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qiz3z2/rkt_and_salesforce_why_its_a_big_deal/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rkpyu0/why_rkt_is_the_next_amazon_of_finance/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w3vdlg)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w3vdlg)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "How big are your bags?", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "You can see them from space.", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "About 500 Dimond shares and two options", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "nope.  in the current market this is the complete wrong type of stock you want to be in.  mortgages and loans are fucked/ RKT is fucked.  houses are fucked.  nobody is using rkt.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "I smell a RKT bag holder.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think you're too early.

Many of us who stayed with RKT while the share price tanked probably less likely to let their shares go at the current market price.  RKT's share price has been on the rise since Mid-June. Meanwhile, the daily short ratio volume has been 60% or above of the daily volume for a long time. This suggests that the share price has been suppressed. RKT has been the target of big shorty.  \n\n\nNot sure if I posted it here, possibly, it was on Yahoo finance! that things wouldn't improve for RKT until after Q2 due to a few reasons we all are familiar with (i.e. inflation/interest rates continue to  rise).  The silver lining is that when things peak, they tend to travels in one direction, downward. Now, there is the fear of recession is looming in the market. This is also not a good news for the sector. If the FED could avoid it, then it is for the better for RKT longs.   \n\n\nFor me, I just need the heavy lifters to grow some balls and come to play with us.  A one-third of RKT floating shares have been shorted.  I'd like to see great revenues being generated in Q2 if not with also profit margin-I doubt it. If the company can show that its market share has grown with its revenues maybe also better than zero profits, then the share price may not move below $7 again. This is a company that generates billions and really good percentage of profit every quarter. This is not a losing stock not even during the market downturn.  This is a much better stock than GME and AMC.  But, investors are fixated on the thought that the volume of home mortgage has shrunk, profits disappeared. However, mortgage stocks gets investors' attention when the interest rates peak and it is about to reverse. So whatever market decides its value by then, share price has to start moving upward.   \nThe question I'd like ask is what those who have short position in RKT are waiting for if the share price is not to move downward any longer while considering the aforementioned reasons. In the last two trading days, RKT short volume ratio was over 70% and 60%, respectively. The stock price didn't move downward. Friday was an option day, so I took twenty-one cents drop as normal. One may argue that the short ratio has been on the rise lately because they know the share price will tank after the Q2 report is released. Yeah, well, that did not work well as intended, did it?.  The daily volume is low and we are not letting are shares go at the current price level.  The longer shorts hold onto their position, the more it is going to get costly for them.  I read a couple of well written articles, back in March 2021 at the time RKT hit $43 and another last summer, by individuals with credentials. They predicted what was going to have with mortgage sector and RKT particularly.  They were spot on. However, neither of them predicted RKT was going to be trading at the current level. The lowest of the estimation was $11-$13 range.  We went beyond it.  So that is my hope that, we may not see $7 again. However, I have said multiple times at Yahoo! finance website that, I would write only puts under $8 and I would not buy calls if it was trading above $7.  That is still what I intend to do.  \nWish you us, the longs, all the best!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Agreeded i Am not 100 on what causes the dam to break.

I was expecting it to go up another 4%-5% since the short ratio has been at or above 60% during the same period except one day when it dived to 40% though the daily volume was not significantly different than any other trading days. However, the short volume was up 3.63% while the days to cover the short volume is down to 9.47 days from 10.3 days as of July 15th compared with the earlier month.\n\nRKT's share price was 7.36 at the closing of June 30th. It reached $8.99 at the closing of July 15th. That is 22.15% lift in ten trading days. Remember that the daily short volume has been at or above 60% of the daily volume. That may have discouraged many retail investors. 370,000 shares is 1.09% of the short volume and .035% of the floating shares. Imagine what happens when long terms buyers are interested in this stock and maybe short ratio shrinks by 10%. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't expect flattering numbers in Q2, who would, right?, but if we see something encouraging in terms of revenues, loan volume, anything, and probably, this may the last major lift in rates by the FED, then two issues will play important role as to whether RKT' share price picks up: 1)I read that although housing inventory is tight, the drop in sale volume will force home prices to come down which may encourage buyers for purchasing\\*. 2) When mortgage loan rate is peaked, it will move in one direction, downward. In other words, both of the options may allow big and retail investors to realign their portfolios. If the share price may not drop significantly from this point on, the question we need ask is why would shorts not be attempted to start closing their position? If something can be catalyst for a buying spree, I think that we could witness a period of panic buy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*Getting a discount at the beginning can be better than receiving lower mortgage rates due to Time value of Money and that home loans are paid off in 10 years on average.
