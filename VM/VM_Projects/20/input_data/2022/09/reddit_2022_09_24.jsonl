If your factory is going to make 50% or 100% more cars next year than this year, then there's no reason to wait on upgrades.

Cheap/Reliable/Efficient petrol cars is a very competitive market, they have a lot of other companies selling very similar products at very similar costs and all of them are using a lot of the same suppliers for a lot of parts. There's really no room for significant disruption or growth left, so if they want to improve they're going to focus on things like tweaking manufacturing as efficiently (as opposed to as soon) as possible, and especially having very flexible and efficient factories with low overhead low inventories, etc. If you end up with too many Corollas they want to be able to switch production to Rav4s or Camrys or whatever and they need to do that without downtime or having to get a bunch of different parts.

All the while, the government and chaplain mustache looking guy are going all over the radio and T.V. talking about how well the war is going and that they are going to win within the next few weeks, the rationing is merely transitory. Put at ease, Hanz then injects his life savings into Reich bonds lmao.\n\nObviously this is an extreme case comparison but there is a massive thread that runs between the two and one of the most intriguing differences that benefit us is we have a massive opportunity to make money from the shake up that will inevitably come.  You have seen first hand literally everything in your life skyrocket in price after they printed 60% of the dollars ever created in 2 years. While the government has only said \"EvERyTHinG iS FiNe\". I don't blame them for it, if they came out and said we're screwed think about the reaction.\n\nInflation is an empire killer that is for sure and the Dollar is probably one of the most if not the most important pillar of Americas global power.

While Powell said hold my beer and has absolutely launched them to the moon in 7 months. The best part is that real rates are still supremely negative by over 4% lmao. The hope and prayer from the FED is that this shock treatment will scare the economy in such a way that it will cool rapidly. \n\nIf July-August taught us anything of the psychology of the market right now is it is still a speculative perma-bull environment that will latch on to anything and puuuuump on a wing and a prayer. Get in control of your emotions, take advantage of this inefficiency, and make some money. Don't feel comfortable being a bear edge lord? Remember in times like these cash is king.\n\n**Plays:**\n\nLet me start and say, DO NOT short the hole or your normie butt will get wiped out. Personally, I prefer to short through options and do not buy contracts when the vix is elevated or you'll get churned. Wait for a bear market rally(there were like 16 in Dot Com bubble burst of greater than 20%) and Vix to be \\~20 and make your play. I have been greatly successful in shorting treasuries as interest rates rise because the bond market has been extremely emotional and inefficient. Most recently the \"easing\" that took place over July saw rates tumble for no reason at all other than investor greed and presented amazing opportunity.\n\n[TLT](https://imgur.com/a/HXlsiuK) positions, note Merrill has a fucked up position mapping and I'm way to lazy to chop and sort it after writing this novel.\n\nOn equities, specifically the [Naz](https://imgur.com/a/YQ0wHkq) being full of shitcos, same concept applies and this is where I somewhat was a virgin and should have had the balls to take some more risk in terms of position size but it is what it is.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI'd like to finish this by saying that yes I have a bearish outlook in terms of market prices but this isn't a perma bear scenario where the economy will be screwed for life. After the shakeup, it will create new ground for a bull market to form. Businesses will still continue to grow and make profit it is just the price people are willing to pay for it will change.
