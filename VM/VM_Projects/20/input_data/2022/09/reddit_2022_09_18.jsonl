Here are the 10 best quotes.", "selftext": "* Greg Jensen warned the Fed's rate hikes could spark a market downturn and a deep recession.\n* The Bridgewater Associates boss predicted stubborn inflation, slower growth, and weaker earnings.\n* Jensen said the US is at the center of a global financial bubble that may be about to burst.\n\nInvestors are delusional if they think the Federal Reserve can vanquish inflation without tanking asset prices and plunging the US economy into a major recession, Bridgewater Associates' Greg Jensen has warned.\n\nThe co-chief investor of Ray Dalio's hedge fund predicted stubborn price increases, slowing growth, and a decline in corporate earnings, speaking at the SALT hedge fund conference in New York this week.\n\nHe also said the US is at the heart of a global financial bubble, argued the pandemic has permanently transformed the world, and highlighted regions and markets where he sees bargains.\n\n# Here are Jensen's 10 best quotes, lightly edited for length and clarity:\n\n1. \"The biggest mistake priced into markets right now is the belief that we're going to return to pricing similar to pre-COVID. That inflation is expected to come down to a little under 3% over the next 18 months or so, and that will happen without much of a recession.\"\n\n2. \"The markets aren't pricing in how constrained policymakers are ‚Äî how impossible it will be to have the markets' expected combination of reasonably good earnings growth and low inflation.\"\n\n3. \"It's a mistake to think things can revert to normal, that we've had the drawdown, and the worst is behind us. We're still in the early phase of dealing with a radically different world than pre-COVID.\" (Jensen highlighted examples of what's changed: less globalization, a shrinking role for financial markets, and more government influence.)\n\n4. \"You're going to have inflation staying stubbornly higher than markets are expecting, as growth starts to turn down. That's when it gets really tricky, and that's what's going to create the more risky part of the downturn ‚Äî when it becomes clear that earnings are falling, and rates are still rising.\"\n\n5. \"The downturn feels big, but asset prices are still quite high by historical standards. The decline is quite small, relative to the change in the underlying fundamental conditions. There's a lot more to come, and it'll get scary when everybody thinks it's not a temporary blip, but a more permanent phenomenon. That's when the bottom will start to come in.\"\n\n6. \"The recession will probably be longer, more grinding than a crash. It's not easy to say if it will be three years or one year, but the magnitude of it is likely to be large and difficult.\"\n\n7. \"There's a decent chance that the market isn't going to react to the European crisis until it's deeply upon us, which I think will be in the next couple months.\" (Jensen was referring to Russia's invasion of Ukraine driving up food and energy prices, eroding economic growth, and heaping political and fiscal pressure on European governments.)\n\n8. \"The worst thing for the US is it's priced to be the greatest economy going forward, and not to have major problems. The US is the center of a financial bubble, and it's the most at risk from liquidity being pulled.\" (Jensen noted that assets that don't generate cash flows to support their valuations ‚Äî such as cryptocurrencies ‚Äî are most at risk of declining when the Fed hikes interest rates and reduces the money supply.)\n\n9. \"Bear markets can go on for a long time. You can be in Japan and you can have a 25-year bear market. You have to know that's a possibility, and you have to prepare for that now.\"\n\n10. \"There are places in the world that are having very different cycles than the US, UK, and Europe. It's difficult in a tightening world of rising risk premiums and declining liquidity, but there are areas that look relatively attractive.\" (Jensen pointed to parts of Latin America, and commodities that haven't received sufficient investment and are less growth sensitive than other assets.)", "id": "xhd7uj", "created_utc": 1663497142.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Same guy who said China was a better investment than the US in 2020?\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/ray-dalio-chinas-ascension-u-s-challenges-pose-a-very-special-moment-for-global-market-shift-11605377679", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yes same guy that operates the world‚Äôs  largest hedge fund with consistent alpha over the market‚Äôs benchmark. \n\nIf you think you‚Äôre being smart by saying he got one call wrong you have no idea how trading works.\n\nTrading is managing risk and making money even when your thesis is wrong.

{"title": "March 9, 2009: WJS Article Day of the Bottom", "selftext": "JUST HOW LOW can stocks go?\n\nDespite Friday's small gain, the Dow Jones Industrial Average marked its fourth consecutive week of losses as it tumbled through the 7000-point mark and spiraled to new 12-year lows. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is trading below 700 for the first time since 1996.\n\nAs earnings estimates are ratcheted down and hopes for a quick economic fix fade, the once-inconceivable notion of returning to Dow 5000 or S&P 500 at 500 looks a little less far-fetched.\n\nA decline to 500 on the S&P is 183.38 points and 27% away. The index already has lost 881.77 points, or 56%, since its peak in October 2007. The index, which lost 7% last week, hasn't been below 500 since 1995, when the tech-stock bubble was just beginning. After dropping 6.2% last week, the Dow is 1626.94 points and 25% above 5000, a level it also hasn't seen since 1995.\n\nAnalysts and investors looking at valuations, history and stock-price trends are mostly predicting the indexes will avoid plumbing those lows, although all concede that, in this market, anything is possible.\n\nEven Wall Street strategists are crunching the numbers, while sticking to forecasts of a second-half rally.\n\nGoldman Sachs's David Kostin in late February presented three scenarios for the S&P, including a \"bear case\" that put the index at 400 to 500. Although Mr. Kostin says he doesn't anticipate the index will fall that low, \"these are the cases that different types of investors are making,\" he says.\n\nLooking solely at valuations, namely price relative to earnings estimates, the S&P at 500 isn't necessarily a wild stretch.\n\nThe current 2009 earnings estimate for S&P companies is about $64 a share, down from about $113 last April, according to S&P. Goldman is now predicting $40, having cut its forecast from $53 in late February. Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates $46 a share, and Citigroup is predicting $51. At $64, the S&P is trading at about 11 times earnings. At $40, the index is at about 17 times. \n\nA level of 500 on the S&P is \"possible, but I wouldn't put it in the realm of probable,\" says Thomas Lee, chief U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan. Mr. Lee on March 2 removed a tentative \"buy\" recommendation he had placed on the S&P in February.\n\nMr. Lee sees a tentative bottom for stocks in mid-2009, together with a trough in the economy. From there, he is still \"really comfortable\" with the prospect of the S&P heading toward 1100 by year end.\n\nThere's a good chance the market could keep going lower,\" says Bill Strazzullo, chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading.\n\nHis firm's targets are 500 on the S&P and 5500 on the Dow, using charts of buying and selling trends. A small bounce may come around 650 for the S&P as short sellers take profits around that level, Mr. Strazzullo says. Long-term buyers have also been \"active\" at about those levels and may help push prices higher temporarily, he says.\n\n\"Some people may say that is the bottom, but I think there is another leg to go on this,\" Mr. Strazzullo says. \"That last leg will probably be the general public throwing in the towel.\"", "id": "xhfati", "created_utc": 1663503888.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "\"Some people may say this is the bottom, but I think there is another leg to go on this\" \n-Mr. Strazzullo, at the exact bottom", "score": 24, "replies": []}, {"body": "If I'm remembering correctly, I think when the market bottomed, the intra-day low on the S&P500 was 666.", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "666.79 yep", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "That's wicked", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "A Plunge protection team set it at 666.", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "a 12-year low would put SPY at $110.
