{"title": "Intuit stock analysis and valuation - An amazing company", "selftext": "I've been sharing weekly stock analysis/valuation and intend to continue doing so in the future. This week, it's Intuit, a company that is loved by many for its great product portfolio and amazing share price performance, crushing the S&P500 in the last decade.\n\nAs always, the post will be divided into a few segments:\n\n1. Understanding the business\n2. Understanding the historical financial performance\n3. Laying down some assumptions to value the company\n4. Valuing the company based on assumptions significantly different than mine\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is Intuit? - Understanding the business**\n\nIn a nutshell, it is a software company that is specializing in financial software. This was accurate, until recently, as they've acquired MailChimp, although it is a great fit within their product offering, it is a CRM software.\n\nThe main products that they own are:\n\n\\- Quickbooks (An accounting package)\n\n\\- Turbotax (package for the preparation of US income tax returns)\n\n\\- Mint (personal finance management tool)\n\n\\- Credit Karma (Acquired during their 2021 fiscal year)\n\n\\- Mailchimp (Acquired during their 2022 fiscal year)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fiscal year of Intuit starts on August 1st and ends on July 31st. I'm mentioning this as their 2022 numbers are already out to avoid confusion about how that's possible mid-year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Historical financial performance**\n\nThe company has crushed all expectations over the last 5 years, revenue has grown from $6b in 2018 to $12,7b in 2022 (Average revenue growth of 21%).\n\nIn most companies, there was a dip in 2020/2021 due to the impact of the pandemic. However, that was not the case at all when it comes to Intuit due to the nature of their products.\n\nFor example, if there's a small business, that has 30% less revenue in a given year, it has to cut certain expenditures. However, having bookkeeping software is a must. Regardless if there are 100 or 1,000 transactions, as long as a business is running, there will be demand for Quickbooks. The demand would decrease only in two cases:\n\n1. Businesses go bankrupt, hence there's no need to have bookkeeping software anymore.\n2. There's another product with better quality, that's cheaper.\n\nAs for individuals, if someone earned 30% less money during the pandemic, they still need to file their tax return, hence, the demand for Turbotax remains high.\n\nSo, we have high-retention products, most of them subscription-based. The gross margin has been over 82% which is amazing.\n\nThe rest of the operating expenses have been fixed as % of revenue over time (roughly 56%) and do not fluctuate significantly. So, Intuit has been growing and the operating expenses have been growing at the same pace.\n\nHence, the operating margin has been stable between 26 and 29% during the last 5 years.\n\nThe free cash flow that is being generated a year is below $3b (I am not adding back the share-based compensation in the FCF calculation).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe size of their balance sheet has grown significantly, from $5b at the end of their fiscal year 2018, to $27,7b as of 2022! This is primarily due to their acquisitions as the goodwill + the other intangible assets acquired account for $19b of the difference.\n\nPart of the acquisition was funded by debt, so at the end of 2022, their debt position (excluding leases) was around $7b. Although this is a significant increase compared to 2018 when the debt was less than $400m, this is still fairly low for a company with a market cap of $127b.\n\nThe excess cash that the company generates over time is being returned to the shareholder, partly via the dividend (0.69% dividend yield, I know, a great number) and partly via share buybacks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Assumptions about the future & valuation**\n\nThe management is guiding for revenue growth of between 14-16% for the next 12 months and analysts are expecting similar growth for the year after that.\n\nAs for the operating margin, based on the historical performance, it is quite clear that it is settled between 25% - 30%.\n\nMy assumptions:\n\n**- Revenue growth** of 14% for the next year, followed by 12% up until year 5, and then slowly decrease to the risk-free rate of 3.32%. The market that they're after is not one that's significantly growing, so the organic growth cannot be there for a long period of time.\n\n**- Operating margin** of 25% for the next year, increasing to 29% over time. After the two acquisitions, it takes a bit of time to identify the synergies and reduce costs, some of them being driven by duplication of roles.\n\n**- A discount rate of 8.9%** (WACC-based)\n\nBased on these assumptions, the fair value of the company is $54,3b (**$192.6/share**)\n\nThe current market cap is $126.85b ($450/share)\n\n*Note: I have taken into account the cash, debt, and deferred taxes on their balance sheet as well as the outstanding equity options.* \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**\n\nBased on the assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 149% to $31,7b in 10 years and the operating margin will be 29%.\n\nI am aware that my assumptions could be significantly wrong. So, let's take a look at how the value of the company (per share) will change based on different assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Revenue / Op. margin|27%|29%|31%|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|120% ($28,0b)|$159.3|$173.5|$187.8|\n|149% ($31,7b)|$176.8|$192.6|$208.4|\n|300% ($50,9b)|$267.3|$291.4|$315.4|\n|500% ($76,4b)|$383.6|$418.3|$453.0|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe table illustrates how much the company needs to grow and how high should the operating margin be so that Intuit is fairly valued today. \n\nThe management has done a great job, I really like the products and I would love to own Intuit. But at today's share price, it is over 2x what is fair value based on my assumptions.\n\nThe only decision that I'm not a big fan of is the share buyback decision. If this activity is being performed when the shares are overvalued, it destroys wealth for the remaining shareholders. Vice-versa, when the share price is undervalued, buying back shares creates value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Intuit, its products, and its valuation?", "id": "xbkyob", "created_utc": 1662908920.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "Fuck Intuit.

Intuit is essentially skimming $50 off of the majority of all tax payers.   Why can't the IRS send out a pre-filled tax form, saving a lot of people $50 and a lot of time each year?    Likely lobbying from the likes of Intuit, as such a change while being good for most people, would mean Intuit's business and profits would significantly decrease.   \n\nWhy is there no open source tax software?   Mozilla, Linux etc. are open source, folks have for whatever reasons created a lot of really complicated software.   Tax software would be relatively easy, but the IRS has no mechanism to receive the files unless it comes from Intuit et. al. and that is by design.  \n\nFor much less than $50 per tax payer, it seems like the IRS could develop and publish it's own software.  \n\nYeah, the company might be profitable, and the stock might be good, but it is immoral, like defense contractors and pharmaceuticals.

This adage was fine and true, before social media. If we are in fact in a true bear market, market crash, and/or recession it would be the first of the social media age. That, in my opinion, changes the game. Main stream media pushes a narrative, social media is a shit storm of all narratives. So, during most down turns, people wouldn't see it coming because all they would have for news/updates is main stream media. Nowadays we have social media where every swinging dick voices their opinion a good portion of which say there's a crash imminent. \n\nSo what I'm saying is, we can no longer rely on what had been true of the past because we are in a new age of social media.

{"title": "DD - Arrival (ARVL) is due for Start of Production Announcement by end of Q3", "selftext": "Arrival - a EV SPAC company has been absolutely destroyed this past year (along with most other EV SPACs). However, unlike most other EV startups Arrival has confirmed that they will hit SOP in their Bicester plant by the end of Q3 (In about two weeks).\n\n**The Good:**\n\nSOP is a big deal, and the announcement should cause the SP to bounce. Shares have found a floor around $1.10, with significant resistance at $1.00. The price also just broke out of a descending channel, and is clearly waiting for the announcement to begin a move back up.\n\n**The Bad:**\n\nIn their recent earnings Arrival said that they were only going to deliver 20 vans to UPS this year, down from announcing that they were going to produce 600. Unfortunately this info might mean that the SOP announcement won't mean much and won't cause the SP to move one direction or the other.\n\n**The Conspiracy:**\n\nSome of you might remember me from Canoo, where we very strongly suspected a deal with Wal-Mart  long before it happened. Arrival already has a deal with UPS, but their delayed SOP announcement is puzzling. If they're truly only making 20 vans, they could easily announce SOP at any time. With only 20 vans being made by the end of the year, they could basically hand-make each one and still fulfill quota.\n\nIn the Q2 earnings, Arrival said:\n\n'*Some of the vans produced this year will go into an Arrival fleet for customer demos and trials and approximately 20 vehicles are expected to be delivered to customers in Q4 2022.*'\n\nWhile only delivering 20 vans isn't amazing, Arrival never outright said they were only going to **make** 20 vans. The share price took a nosedive on this news, but I believe it has been overplayed. Arrival made a generic statement, and is looking to surprise with numbers to get SP back up.\n\n**The Conspiracy-cy:**\n\nOnce again, Arrival could announce SOP at *any* time, and still make their quota. What are they waiting for? There was a recent picture of a presentation for the Saudis on Arrival, as well as their microfactories and composite technology. While this may be a nothing-burger, it is possible that given the very low SP that arrival is in the process of being bought out and we will hear about SOP at the same time as the M/A.\n\nAdditionally - the options chain on this stock is very limited in terms of weeklies. With SP sitting around $1, weeklies only go up to $2 or $3. If this runs, there is very little ability for hedging via weekly options and the SP could really move.\n\n**The Plays:**\n\n**Safe:**\n\nShares are cheap and should give a 20%+ return once SP has been announced. I personally expect us to get back to the $1.50 range at least on the SOP announcement, but $1.30 is a good bet.\n\n**Gamble:**\n\nJan 2023 $1.50 calls are dirt cheap and could make massive returns if SP moves up to $1.50.\n\n**Degeneracy:**\n\nIf you think that an M/A is in the cards soon, October $1.50 calls are $5. A $5bil buyout would net a  **11900% gain.**", "id": "xbqxbn", "created_utc": 1662923603.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|9|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|92|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pwnt0x/dr_goev_how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_just/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pu6jg3/dd_goev_ceo_just_bought_the_dip/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pwngge/dr_goev_how_i_learned_to_stop_worrying_and_just/) \n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xbqxbn)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xbqxbn)\n    \nHey /u/Dekkars, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "https://imgur.com/a/k8UYapz", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Oof![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "DD?

With DD on these small EV companies, it should be a requirement to state how much additional cash they’ll need 1) before production, and 2) forecasted to FCF.

Your long term bet is that investors will keep putting cash into the company.  So far this year, it hasn’t happened and their forecast is much worse than 12 months ago.\n\nVery very very few GOEV holders made money off that 250% spike.  Why would they sell?
