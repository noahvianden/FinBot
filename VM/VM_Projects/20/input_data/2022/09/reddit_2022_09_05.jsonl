{"title": "Unusual Options Activity on Cameco Corp (CCJ): Sense or Nonsense?", "selftext": "An article was published yesterday on Barchat about \"Investors buying a ton of call options in Cameco Corp (uranium stock)\".Cameco Corporation (CCJ) is the supposedly the world's largest publicly traded company, and it is based in Saskatchewan, Canada.\n\nThe rational behind this is Russia recently turning off the tap of natural gas supplies to Europe. The reaction, then, of the affected European governments is a \"sudden interest\" in nuclear power. Take for example, *France's Electricite de France (EDF)* just announced its commitment to restarting all its nuclear power reactors by winter. The expectation is that other European countries like Germany may follow suit and as you may have already seen or heard of the planned protests in Berlin and Leipzig.\n\nMost of the calls purchased are out-of-the-money (OTM) calls with strikes 31 & 37. (A) The 31Call has a total volume of 22,774 and with the avg. price/contract at $3.00, this amounts to $6.83 million total investment.(B) 37Call --> 22,667Vol x 1.40 avg. price/contract --> $3.173 Million investment\n\nThe stock is currently at $28.82 which is already a 15% in the prior month. From (A) above, investors expect CCJ to rise 7.6% more than its current price.From (B) above, investors expect CCJ to rise 28.4% more than its current price.\n\n# The financials and fundamentals:\n\nThe stock is said to have a high valuation. Well, even a quick look at the P/E ratio makes one quite uncomfortable like swimming on a cold lake. The *P/E ratio is 235.07* as per Market Watch. *For the quarter ended June 2022, they reported a total revenue of CAD $557.58M, net income = CAD$83.98M, and diluted EPS = CAD$0.21.*\n\nThough, analysts forecast EPS of up to 1.05$ next year 2023, EPS could be $0.75 as some other analysts propose. At 1.05$, this is roughly 27x the current stock price. The problem, it seems, is that investors are expecting 43x earnings (anywhere from $45 - $50) at the $37 strike which has 22,667Vol and a $3.173 Mil investment.\n\nThe author of this article even goes ahead to point out that this play is some \"sort of greater fool theory\" play\n\n**Can anyone speak to the validity of this buying interest? As an aside, another interesting unusual options flow are AEO puts, AMC puts and TWTR calls - trying to make sense of those ones too.**\n\nSource: [https://www.barchart.com/story/news/10020100/investors-are-buying-a-ton-of-call-options-in-uranium-stock-cameco-corp](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/10020100/investors-are-buying-a-ton-of-call-options-in-uranium-stock-cameco-corp)\n\nEdit: Unusual Option Flow: [https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity/stocks](https://www.barchart.com/options/unusual-activity/stocks) ", "id": "x6nf37", "created_utc": 1662402475.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "> Cameco Corporation (CCJ) is the supposedly the world's largest publicly traded company ....\n\nYou mean the world's largest publicly traded URANIUM MINING compay.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, thanks for the correction", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Largest publicly traded URANUS company", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Uranium spot price is trending up, for whatever reason.

Below, I break down why legendary investor Jeremy Grantham says recent rebounds in stocks have merely been a bear-market rally and the market could crash more than 50%.\n\n**1. The \"superbubble\" in stocks is entering its final stages,** according to Jeremy Grantham, who made a name for himself predicting a number of bubbles would burst ahead of huge crashes, including the dot-com crash and the 2008 crash.\n\n\"Prepare for an epic finale,\" Grantham said in a note to clients Wednesday, adding that the recent rebound in stocks marked a false dawn. \"If history repeats, the play will once again be a Tragedy.\"\n\nGrantham forecasted a brutal selloff in which assets ranging from stocks to properties plunge in value.\n\nHe rang a similar bell back in January, when he warned that a superbubble was about to implode and that stocks could crater 50%.\n\nAt one point in June, the S&P 500 traded 20% below its January peak, though they have since recovered some of those losses.\n\nBut even more so now than before, Grantham sees an unprecedented mix of dangerous elements among the housing market, inflation, geopolitics, and energy.\n\n\"Between COVID in China, war in Europe, food and energy crises, record fiscal tightening, and more, the outlook is far grimmer than could have been foreseen in January,\" he said.\n\nWhile Bank of America isn't as gloom-and-doom as Grantham, the bank's analysts reiterated a downbeat outlook of a 9% drop in the S&P 500 by year-end, reiterating their view that the summer of gains since June was nothing more than a bear market rally.\n\n\"There are still no real signs of a bull market,\" BofA strategists wrote Thursday, also noting that indexes haven't seen the full impact of the Fed's monetary policy moves.\n\n**2. US stocks futures rise early Friday, as global bonds fell into their first bear market in more than 30 years**. Meanwhile, European stocks were also up, as data signals Russia will resume gas flows via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline as planned. Here are the latest market moves.\n\n**3. On the docket:** Global Blue Group Holding AG, Ross Group PLC, and more reporting.\n\n**4. These small-cap stocks are trading cheap and offer huge upside**, according to Morningstar analysts.

P/S is a bit higher than pre-covid but that's fair due to higher margins as they've shifted to services.\n\nAn asset can be priced however a buyer/seller want to price it.

They are right around 25x P/E right now, so they're within range of fair value. Rates are increasing though and in the last QT period leading up to 2018/2019 pivot, apple was closer to 20x.

If earnings can catch up before multiple reality sets in, the price will not actually drop.\n\nForward estimate earnings for APPL is about $6.45/share. Using the 20x multiple and that earnings estimate gets you to $129/share. This is still a 16% drop from current levels.

Here are some stunning excerpts:\n\n* Since 1993, consolidation has reduced the number of large defense firms from 107 to five.\n* Amazon sells 74 percent of all e-books sold online, and it sells 64 percent of all print books sold online.\n* CVS and Walgreens control 89% of the drug store business.\n* Google controls [64 percent](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Rankings/comScore-Releases-February-2016-US-Desktop-Search-Engine-Rankings) of all desktop searches and [94 percent](https://www.netmarketshare.com/search-engine-market-share.aspx?qprid=4&qpsp=2016&qpnp=1&qptimeframe=Y&qpcustomd=1) of all global and mobile tablet searches.\n* Two companies, Mars and Hershey, control 75% of the candy market in America.\n\nBig Tech companies are the most well-known offenders with a few companies controlling almost everything we do online.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tfk568r9g1m91.png?width=680&format=png&auto=webp&s=483b13830e96cc3d3ba80fddabb2eb5bfd5e5bdc\n\nWhile it’s Big Tech that captures all the headlines, almost all the industries are now dominated by a few companies. Look around your store the next time you go grocery shopping - you might think that as a consumer you have a plethora of choices. But in reality,\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/92tsiukag1m91.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=aac3a72e7f926223c47fd47cb1c4826efd2109ab\n\nThere are arguments [for and against](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/economics-101-what-is-a-monopoly) a few companies controlling the majority of market share that are beyond the scope of this article. *The question which I’m interested in as an investor is* whether these companies tend to outperform the market and provide stable returns while doing so.\n\nAfter all, Warren Buffett’s favorite types of business are the ones that have huge economic moats which are near-monopolies in the industries they operate in. Once, [asked at an annual meeting](https://www.barrons.com/articles/myth-of-capitalism-book-excerpt-51544500404) what his ideal business was, Buffett argued that it was one that had “high pricing power, a monopoly.” The message is clear according to Buffett: If you’re investing in a business with competition, you’re doing it wrong.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nc9a7tzbg1m91.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f28fc31ef7639a2c5c83841574a6b0151bb5bf0\n\n### Monopoly Returns\n\nAnyone who has played the Monopoly board game knows the unbridled joy of collecting rent for the properties you own and driving your competitors to bankruptcy. I wanted to see if the same process is reflected in real life where companies having a monopoly in certain sectors could drive out competitors, rise prices, and give an outsized return on investment.\n\nIf you try to do a backtest on the biggest monopolies of today, you would quickly run into hindsight bias. The companies that are monopolies now might or might not have been monopolies a decade back. For example, there was no way of knowing Google would dominate the in-app ecosystem in Phones, and that Amazon would be the king of cloud services back in 2010.\n\nTo overcome this, I went back in time *(using this* [*nifty little feature from Google*](https://mashable.com/article/google-search-by-date)*)* and searched for publications covering monopoly investments. I found two relevant articles that we can use for the analysis.\n\n1. **The next 7 American Monopolies** \\- [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-next-7-american-monopolies-2010-11?IR=T) (2010)\n2. **The Forbes.com Monopoly Index** \\- [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/2001/06/13/monopolyindex.html?sh=16b32f1e4a2d) (2001)\n\nA total of 17 stocks were covered by the two publications. Our benchmark as always is the tried and trusted S&P 500 as most of the companies covered in the research are large-cap stocks.\n\nThe results are incredible. Monopoly companies on average returned **double** that of the S&P 500 benchmark during the same period. 65% of the companies in the list beat the benchmark and only in 2 cases would you have lost money on your investments (*yes, even adjusting for inflation).*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ao8m2c7fg1m91.png?width=997&format=png&auto=webp&s=43451cf0978eaaa10288d1ec08438f899497d589\n\nThe results were so surprising that I checked academic research papers to see if what I was observing was in line with the norm *(as we are slightly away from the sample size required for significance)*. While there are no direct papers evaluating the performance of monopolies, established research shows that companies having large market share tend to outperform smaller competitors and the market.\n\n[**Journal of Business & Economics Research**](https://clutejournals.com/index.php/JBER/article/view/2756/2804) evaluated the performance of 85 companies (50 Large-Cap & 35 Mid-Cap Firms) with wide economic moats.\n\n>*Relative to the market, the aggregate appreciation of large-caps surpassed more than 85 percent of all stocks and the mid-caps more than 78 percent. While there were individual laggards on both lists, they were relatively few in number. The author’s subset demonstrated the most pronounced gains. All three lists would have handily surpassed the S&P benchmark during the benchmark period.*  \n*Source:* [*Is sustainable competitive advantage an advantage for stock investors?*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1062976916300151)\n\n[**Applied Economics**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1062976916300151) investigated the stock returns of companies with sustainable competitive advantage (the moat).\n\n>*Our results indicate that Wide Moat stocks have created significant value for their investors. An equal and value-weighted portfolio of these companies rebalanced annually has outperformed both the S&P 500 and Russell 3000 indices over the period of our study (June 2002–May 2014).*\n\n### Conclusion\n\nI wish this would be as simple as investing in companies in industries having a high concentration. But, as always, all the simple & direct strategies tend to be captured already in the market. [Recent studies](https://www.sparklinecapital.com/post/monopolies-are-distorting-the-stock-market) indicate that\n\n>*Stocks in concentrated industries trade at higher multiples as the market is smart enough to recognize their monopoly power. Therefore, an investment strategy that simply buys companies in concentrated industries does not outperform.*\n\nThis does not mean all is lost - We just have to go one step deeper. The same studies show that you can outperform the market by:\n\na. **Investing in industries with rising concentration** as the market seems slow to recognize their increased prizing power\n\nb. **Adding a layer of valuation metric** \\- When monopoly companies run into difficulty, investors tend to underestimate their ability to rebound and undervalue their shares.\n\nSo the next time you’re considering a stock for long-term investment, add this layer to your analysis: Does the company have prospects of growing into a monopoly or dominant player in a market with just a few players, or is it a lucrative market where competitors can eat away the profits? The first is what you should bet on.", "id": "x6fpxb", "created_utc": 1662383049.0, "score": 60, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|91|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|309|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n940ns/i_analyzed_9000_trades_made_by_us_senators_in_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p9c0zc/onlyfans_the_prn_empire_with_no_prn/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsvma5/i_analyzed_all_the_controversial_trades_made_by/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/synpkf/backtesting_the_most_popular_investment/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tdwltb/how_does_the_stock_market_perform_in_a_recession/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok4l9c/i_analyzed_the_performance_of_companies_in_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6wr4/does_index_inclusion_positively_affect_stock/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/piyri4/the_index_fund_bubble_should_you_be_worried/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oq1mv3/an_unbiased_take_on_the_robinhood_ipo_the_good/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oawsxf/i_analyzed_last_15_years_of_news_articles_to_see/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x6fpxb/investing_in_monopolies/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vmn5e1/activist_short_selling_i_analyzed_the_performance/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qqseif/what_is_the_best_time_to_buy_an_ipo_i_analyzed/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rvuzw8/should_you_listen_to_jim_cramer_i_analyzed_20000/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbtp0q/dont_paper_hand_gme_due_to_boomer_bots_real/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtehdq/i_analyzed_all_700_buy_and_sell_recommendations/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tiiqb6/i_analyzed_2000_stock_splits_over_the_last_3/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kl4fhj/one_more_stock_indicator_to_consider_before_your/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q9yeo2/why_is_simple_dollar_cost_averaging_still_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p0esdp/do_hedge_funds_beat_the_market_i_analyzed_the/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mnho9j/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o70k70/i_analyzed_the_last_3_decades_of_stock_market/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s1c3r3/should_you_invest_in_sustainable_companies_i/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/px5nt4/should_you_invest_in_the_most_reputable_brands_in/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/njxv95/a_dd_on_inflation_how_it_affects_stock_prices_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p4tjye/do_actively_managed_mutual_funds_beat_the_index/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n1t0yz/i_analyzed_all_the_motley_fool_premium/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pttfma/should_you_follow_insider_transactions_i_analyzed/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mikm42/i_built_a_program_that_tracks_mentions_and/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlscp1/can_wallstreetbets_beat_the_market_i_analyzed/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/gallery/kl4ixe) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=x6fpxb)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=x6fpxb)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think Duopoly are also good investing targets.\n\nThey maintain the illusion of choice.\n\n KO/Pepsi\n\nAMD/NVDA\n\nAAPL/GOOL", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "APPL/GOOGL are only a duopoly in the mobile space.\n\nAPPL, MSFT, and GOOGL is the real trifecta.

{"title": "Meta has been fined $402 million by the Irish Data Protection Commission for its handling of children’s privacy settings on Instagram", "selftext": "A fat fine — of $402 million — is headed Instagram’s way after European Union privacy regulators came to a decision on a long running complaint related to how the social media platform handles children’s data. The penalty is for a breach of the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\nMeta was contacted for comment on the penalty.\n\nWe understand the final GDPR decision on the Instagram enquiry was sent to Meta, Instagram’s parent, Friday — ahead of formal publication on the websites of the company’s lead data supervisor in the EU, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC); and the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), a steering body which helped coordinate a decision review process involving other interested EU data protection authorities — however the size of the penalty for Meta appears to have leaked early, via a report in Politico, which contains the fine figure (which shakes out to around $403M at current currency exchange prices) but no further details of the decision.\n\nIreland’s DPC confirmed the level of fine to us. Deputy commissioner, Graham Doyle, told TechCrunch: “We adopted our final decision last Friday and it does contain a fine of €405 million. Full details of the decision will publish next week.”\n\nThe Instagram penalty is the largest GDPR penalty the social media giant has been hit with to-date (though not the largest ever GDPR fine; that one landed on Amazon) — following a $267M penalty levied upon the Meta-owned messaging platform WhatsApp last September for violations of the GDPR’s transparency principle.\n\nThe Instagram complaint focused on the platform’s processing of children’s data for business accounts and on a user registration system it operated which the DPC found could lead to the accounts of child users being set to “public” by default, unless the user changed the account settings to set it to “private”.\n\nThe GDPR contains strong measures requiring privacy by design and default generally — as well provisions aimed at enhancing the protection of children’s information specifically, as well as ensuring that services targeting kids are living up to transparency and accountability principles (such as by providing suitably clear communications that children can understand).\n\nThe reasoning underpinning the fine for Instagram is expected to be released in the coming days, when the final decision gets published next week (assuming it doesn’t leak early).\n\nWhile today’s headlines are going to make painful reading for Meta, TikTok is another social media firm likely to be watching developments closely since it’s under investigation by the DPC over its own handling of children’s data. But that enquiry was only opened by the DPC a year ago so it’s likely to have some time to run before a decision is reached.\n\nThe Instagram decision took extra time as other DPAs raised objections to Ireland’s draft decision — triggering a mechanism in the regulation designed to settle disputes which can add many more months to the timeframe.\n\nIreland’s WhatsApp decision also went through a review process after objections were raised to its draft — and in that case the size of the penalty was substantially raised as a result. But it remains to be seen whether the same has happened here, with Instagram.\n\nSource: [https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/05/instagram-gdpr-fine-childrens-privacy/](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/05/instagram-gdpr-fine-childrens-privacy/)", "id": "x6lyop", "created_utc": 1662398897.0, "score": 279, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|232|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|88|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=x6lyop)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=x6lyop)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Fuck taxes, fining Meta is free money 🤣", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Its the new meta", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "META also just forced you to make a META account if you want to continue using the Oculus.\n\nStay away from r/oculusquest all META employees and simps over there", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Hehe.
