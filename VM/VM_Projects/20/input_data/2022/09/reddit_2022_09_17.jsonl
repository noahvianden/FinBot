{"title": "is Tesla the new Apple?", "selftext": "\n\nThe reason for hedge fund Worm Capital’s concentration in Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:TSLA) is due to its conviction in the electric vehicle maker’s dominance relatively early in the cycle, founder and chief investment officer Arne Alsin reportedly said during an investor Q&A session hosted by the fund.\n\n\n\nWhat Happened: Owning Tesla in 2022 is like owning Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2007, even 2003, or even earlier, Alsin said, according to the transcripts of the Q&A session shared by Tesla influencer Merritt Sawyer.\n\n“And this company is going to be much, much bigger than Apple, in my opinion,” he said. He also suggested having more faith in the fund’s Tesla position generating significant returns going forward.\n\n“I think we’ve barely scratched the surface of what this company can become,” Alsin said. His growth projections for Tesla are “far, far” beyond consensus expectations, he added.\n\nSee also: Is Tesla’s Hypergrowth Story Over Or Just Getting Started? Here’s What 2 Top Analysts Say\n\n\n\nThe Worm Capital CEO also predicted a “swell of activity” around Tesla among the investment community and on Wall Street.\n\nCalling Tesla “Wall Street’s favorite stock,” Alsin said it has all the right ingredients, including fast growth into vast, global end markets, rapidly expanding gross and net margins, a wide moat, endless demand for products, and potential upside from energy storage, full-self-driving, bots, and AI.\n\nHe also said he was unfazed by the hatred among some quarters in the investment community.\n\n“Many of the so-called “smart money” on Wall Street wouldn’t touch Amazon Inc.(NASDAQ: NASDAQ:AMZN) in the 2010’s but had no problem buying it in the 2020s,” Alsin said.\n\n\n\nAlsin said the fund’s portfolio is now dominated by Tesla, Spotify Technologies SA (NYSE: SPOT), and Amazon.\n\nPrice Action: In premarket trading on Friday, Tesla shares were down 1.81% at $298.25, according to Benzinga Pro data.\n\nNews source\n\nFacebookTwitterEmailShare\n\nLeave a Reply\n\nYour email address will not be published. Required fields are marked *\n\nComment\n\nName *\n\nEmail *\n\nWebsite\n\nPost navigation\n\nPrevious\n\nARKK Could Skyrocket If Cathie Wood And Elon Musk Are Right\n\nNext\n\nFord’s Mustang Mach-E helped keep\n\nNew entries\n\nAn Electric Ram 1500 Pickup, Will Debut Soon\n\nNew Battery For Electric Cars Charges In Just 3 Minutes\n\nElon Musk’s friends begged him not to buy\n\nIs Tesla Close to Approving\n\nTesla stock: 2023 is ‘a pivotal year,’\n\nArchives\n\nSeptember 2022\n\nAugust 2022\n\nJuly 2022\n\nJune 2022\n\nMay 2022\n\nApril 2022\n\nMarch 2022\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nDecember 2021\n\nNovember 2021\n\nOctober 2021\n\nSeptember 2021\n\nAugust 2021\n\nJuly 2021\n\nJune 2021\n\nMay 2021\n\nApril 2021\n\nMarch 2021\n\nFebruary 2021\n\nJanuary 2021\n\nDecember 2020\n\nNovember 2020\n\nOctober 2020\n\nSeptember 2020\n\nAugust 2020\n\nJuly 2020\n\nJune 2020\n\nMay 2020\n\nApril 2020\n\nMarch 2020\n\nFebruary 2020\n\nJanuary 2020\n\nDecember 2019\n\nHeadings\n\nUncategorized\n\n© 2022 Businesblog | Powered by Outstandingthemes\n\n￼\n\n0Shares", "id": "xgiypz", "created_utc": 1663410529.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "TSLA so much bigger than apple.
