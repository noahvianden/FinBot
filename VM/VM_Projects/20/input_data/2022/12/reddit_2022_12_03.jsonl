That same workforce will become more and more efficient at future reactor constructions once again.\n\n**Chinese big move on nuclear reactor build out**\n\nWestern world (USA, EU, South Korea, Japan) has an increasing supply security issue on different commodities, one of them is uranium.\n\nWhy?\n\nChina is significantly increasing their uranium consumption in coming years, while many western countries are making U-turn on the use of nuclear reactors by extending the operational licence of many existing reactors  (USA, Canada, France, ...) and pushing for new reactors constructions in  the future (a couple big reactors and a lot of SMR's)\n\nThe 150 additional big nuclear reactors that China aims to build from 2021  to 2035 will on their own increase the global uranium consumption by 30%.\n\nAdd to that the additional uranium demand from all the new future non-chinese reactors that are          being build at the moment and in the near future (India, Russian, Turkey, Egypt, ...

This will make the construction of a new working reactor much less longer.\n\n2 months ago Japan utilities met with Cameco to discuss their future uranium needs, because their uranium stockpile reached a critical low level, like in many other countries with nuclear reactors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**South Korea** also made a U-turn recently: [https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?sc=30800028&year=2022&no=770043](https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?sc=30800028&year=2022&no=770043)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**USA** is putting everyting in place to support the future massive build out of SMR (Small Modular Reactors) in the USA, while extending the operational licence of existing reactors:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l4dqjauwjo3a1.png?width=1163&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b4b4bbb20372bdaa2b5abe30690b8021595f292\n\n[https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-power-plant](https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-power-plant)\n\nOther countries making a U-turn in favour of nuclear power are UK, FR, ...\n\n**All the U-turns and announced operational licence extensions of existing reactors the last 4.5 months resulted in an ADDITIONAL \\~10,000,000 lb  ANNUAL uranium demand compared to a total global uranium production of 135,000,000lb in 2022.**\n\nAlso: [https://www.brookfield.com/insights/new-dawn-nuclear-power](https://www.brookfield.com/insights/new-dawn-nuclear-power)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**C. THE GLOBAL URANIUM SUPPLY SIDE**\n\n**In 2022 the global uranium production will only reach 135Mlbs.** And only with a significant higher uranium price in Q42022 than today (\\~50USD/lb), the uranium sector could maybe reach 155Mlbs global production in 2023.\n\nBut the annual uranium demand in 2022, **before the \\~10,500,000lb of unexpected additional ANNUAL uranium demand (July, August, September and October 2022 announcements)** is 190-200Mlbs (primary demand + first impact of overfeeding in 2022) **which reduces operational inventories** of producers, convertors and end-users (utilities).\n\n=> That's a defict of \\~75Mlb in 2022 (200+10-135) and based on my estimates again a deficit of \\~70Mlb in 2023 (200+15+10-155)\n\n**Those operational inventories are now at a critical low level according to UxC (presentation in 1H2022), meaning that there isn't any room anymore to reduce operational inventories further.** So now utilities effectively need to find \\~190Mlbs in the market! But where exactly?\n\nToday the uranium spotprice is \\~49USD/lb, **while the uranium sector needs 80USD/lb to increase production to be able to  get global uranium supply and demand in equilibrium again a couple         years after reaching those 80 USD/lb** (Due to further inflation, soon 90 USD/lb will be needed instead of 80 USD/lb)\n\nNow comes the time that this will be translated in much higher upward pressure in the uranium market (This happens gradually, not overnight. I'm a long term investor)\n\nAnd because the natural uranium cost only represents \\~5% of total production cost of electricity from a nuclear reactor, utilities will not mind to  buy uranium above 100 USD/lb if needed, because the cost of shutting the reactor down due to fuel shortage will cost so much more for the utility than paying 2 times the uranium price of today\n\nExplanation:\n\nTotal electricity production cost of electricity from nuclear reactor with 50USD/lb uranium price = 100\n\nTotal electricity production cost of electricity from nuclear reactor with 100USD/lb uranium price = 100+5=105\n\nThat's only an increase of 5% of total electricity production cost.\n\nAnd in a couple years some existing uranium mines today will be depleted and will need replacement by new uranium mines. But those new uranium  mines need many years of construction and higher uranium prices than today.\n\n**Conclusion:** The uranium price is about to increase significantly and due to the global risk off mode of investor on the global stockmarket at the moment the uranium mining companies have a big upside potential in coming months and couple years. And the market always anticipates.\n\n**This isn't financial advice.

How come?\n\n\\- Solar and wind energy is a decentralised energy production which needs more big cables than a centralised energy production (more copper per kwh produced)\n\n\\- Windturbines need a lot of copper, rare earths (magnets), ... More copper is needed, more rare earths that are rare are needed. But the production of rare earths is \\~80% in the hands of China and the production of it is very polluting. This makes the construction of new windfarms much more expensive because to get more Copper and rare earths the price of copper and rare earths will have to increase significantly.\n\nAnd the production increase of copper and rare earths will not be ready on time for a big global push for additional windturbines. It mathematically speaking not possible.\n\nFor instance. Most of the copper production today comes from big copper mines that were discovered 50 years ago.\n\n\\- Solar and wind energy aren't baseload power on their own, they need a back up (gas and coal fired power stations), many batteries, hydrogen production or a combination of the 3. But their aren't enough commodities (rare earths, vanadium, cobalt,...) for large battery fields all over the world to function as a back up for renewables all over the world. And with more and more EV's in the future, it becomes even less possible.\n\nThe switch to more renewables in fact increases the demand for gas from the utilities (Germany, Belgium in the future, ...). This is a big problem, because China and India (together 2.7 billion people of the 8 billion people on earth) want to reduce their use of coal (Even though they are still building new coal fired plants today, the path to less coal use is clear and on the way) by increasing the use of gas and uranium. At global scale the demand for gas will increase in coming decades and make electricity production more expensive for many years.\n\nThe hydrogen option is a good option but it will not solve the issue entirly. Why?\n\nToday the electricty needed to produce enough hydrogen to run 1 car on hydrogen is the electricty needed to run 5 electricity cars of the same power as that 1 hydrogen car.\n\nMeaning that to run a fleet of hydrogen cars equal to a fleet of electricity cars of the same power, you need 5 times more electricity production than today to produce enough hydrogen. To that I say, good luck!\n\nThat's why I see hyrdogen for planes and trucks in the future, but less for cars.\n\n2) Solar and Wind energy aren't baseload. Meaning that to have 10GW of baseload power you need to build 10GW capacity of windturbines combined with 10GW of back up power (gas or coal fired power plants) so in total 20GW to get 10GW of baseload power compared to 11GW (producing 95% of the time, day and night) to get 10GW of baseload power.\n\nSo looking at the cost of only renewables without looking at the cost of their back power when comparing with the construction cost of nuclear power is comparing apples with oranges\n\n3) Solar and wind power on their own are more polluting and more deadly than nuclear power per kwh produced, because nuclear energy is a very dense energy source.\n\n4) Nuclear wast is stored safely and is very small per kwh produced compared to gas, coal, wind and solar wast. Nuclear wast is stored safely, while gas and coal wast is not even stored but released in the air each day.\n\nDid you know that burning coal emits radioactivity? Good job Germany!\n\n5) The anti nuclear movements when talking about the cost to build new nuclear reactors are focused on the few new reactors build in France (Flamenville), USA (Vogtle), UK. But they neglect to talk about the many reactors build in India, China, United Arab Emirates, ... They have build many reactors and are still building other new reactors on time and almost on budget, not like the couple cases in Europe and USA. In my initial post I explained why that difference.\n\n6) The U-turn for more nuclear power in the near future (extending existing reactors and restarting existing reactors) and in the coming decades (new reactor constructions) is already in motion in a lot of the big countries (USA, Canada, France, China, India, Russia, Japan, South Korea, ...)\n\nIn my opinion, the world needs a good energy mix with renewables, nuclear energy, temporary gas fired power and hydrogen production.\n\nCheers", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wow what a thorough report.

Should be no problem if you just completely ignore all the various things that can go wrong. \n\nThe other nonsense spread by nuclear shills on reddit is of course \"muh reprocessing\". With or without reprocessing, these fission products are dangerous and have to be disposed of in a geologic repository for a considerable amount of time. No reprocessing program can obviate the need for a deep geologic repository. Even complete fissioning of all actinides ・an unrealistic proposition ・will leave behind large amounts of very long-lived fission and activation products like iodine-129, cesium-135, and chlorine-36 that will pose risks far into the future.\n\nAnd lastly, even IF we bury it somewhere and nothing happens, it would still be highly irresponsible since no human insitution will last as long as that shit is in the ground. Imagine if the Romans buried some dangerous shit we occasionally have to deal with. Would make the Romans look like total pieces of shit, right?\n\nYou are either part of or a victim of a decades long PR campaign and false science being put out, in the same manner, style, and using the same PR company as the tobacco industry used when claiming smoking does not cause cancer. The funniest examples of this are of course the people pushing for nuclear as a solution for climate change who also denied climate change during my youth. Now that the environment is ruined, they say \"this is not because you wasted all those hundred of billions on us and destroyed nature, but because you listened too much to the environmentalists!\" What a joke.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Give me one credible source on any of the propaganda fed bullshit you've written.

I also always find it annoying when I am expected to do the work of research for people like you. You can look up my claims yourself and either decide to believe those sources or not. In any event, here are a few sources supporting my claims:\n\n>Inexpensive efficiency improvements and competitive renewable sources can reverse the terrible arithmetic of climate change, which accelerates exponentially as we burn fossil fuels ever faster. Effi ciency can outpace economic growth if we pay attention: between 1977 and 1985, for example, U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew 27 percent, whereas oil use fell 17 percent. (Over the same period, oil imports dropped 50 percent, and Persian Gulf imports plummeted 87 percent.)\nThe growth of renewables has routinely outpaced GDP; worldwide, solar and wind power are doubling every two and three years, respectively. If both effi ciency and renewables grow faster than the economy, then carbon emissions will fall and global warming will slow—buying more time to develop even better technologies for displacing the remaining fossil-fuel use, or to master and deploy ways to capture combustion carbon before it enters the air [see “Can We Bury Global Warming?” by Robert H. Socolow; Scientifi c American, July].\n\n>In contrast, nuclear power is a slower and much more expensive solution. Delivering a kilowatt-hour from a new nuclear plant costs at least three times as much as saving one\nthrough effi ciency measures.\n\nScientific American: https://static.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/media/pdf/Lovinsforweb.pdf\n\n>And if we're talking about the construction of new power plants, then nuclear power is simply excluded. Not just because it is the most expensive form of electricity generation today, but, above all, because it takes a long time to build reactors. In other words, every euro invested in new nuclear power plants makes the climate crisis worse because now this money cannot be used to invest in efficient climate protection options.\n\nFrom an interview with Mycle Schneider, the editor of the World Nuclear Industry Status Report echoing my claims:   https://www.dw.com/en/nuclear-climate-mycle-schneider-renewables-fukushima/a-56712368\n\n>The economic history and financial analyses carried out\nat DIW Berlin show that nuclear energy has always been\nunprofitable in the private economy and will remain so in\nthe future.\n\nSource: https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/201651/1/1671233344.pdf", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Nothing of that is supporting your stupid claims.\n\nPicking a small window where oil/gdp decreased says nothing (you might want to look up how many reactors were coming online in that time though) fossil free consumtion continues to rise even with more renewables.\n\n> In contrast, nuclear power is a slower and much more expensive solution. Delivering a kilowatt-hour from a new nuclear plant costs at least three times as much as saving one through effi ciency measures.\n\nOf course it has taken longer to build new plants when shills like you have suppressed everything related to nuclear the last decades. Germany's pathetic Energiewende has cost 500 BILLION euros and having one of the highest CO2/kWh in Europe. They could've decarbonised their whole grid almost two times over even if you counted with one of the most expensive nuclear power plant in Europe.\n\nAnd I don't have beef with energy effiency measures. EROI is literally larger for nuclear than wind etc unless you take the braindead study were they factor in nuclear war as a consequense of nuclear power. \n\nTake away subsidies, count in how high the electricity price it when its produced, grid stability and jobs plus there's no large scale solution for their intermittency.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "lol I  love that conspiracy theory about how the evil environmentalists were actually controlling all the worlds governments and that is why we do not live in your nuclear cloud-cuckoo-land.

The PREDICTED cost of the Energiewende is 400 billion until 2025. Last time I checked we have 2022 and even if we did not, that is still 100 billion less than your claim.

Just fyi, Germany has spent OVER ONE TRILLION on nuclear energy. Apparently you bypass reality entirely as little more than an annoying impediment. \n\n>intermittency\n\nI already told you that nuclear energy is useless for that. You cannot quickly turn a nuclear power plant on and off like you can do with gas or coal. All you can do is produce an excess of energy or store the produced energy, in which case it is a lot cheaper, faster and cleaner to do the same with renewables. \n\nBut I am wasting my time. You will keep posting without ever engaging anything I said directly and instead make up your own narrative. Will you acknowledge that you outright pulled numbers out of your ass that do not reflect reality? Of course not. You are seemingly incapable of being rational on this subject and, as such, I should simply have not engaged you in the first place.

Nuclear takes 5 to 17 years longer between planning and operation and produces on average 23 times the emissions per unit electricity generated.
