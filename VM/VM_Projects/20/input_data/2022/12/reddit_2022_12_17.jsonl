{"title": "How to Read/ Play what happened with Tesla 150 resistance today?", "selftext": "Two days ago I grabbed a few grand of 12/16 puts at strike 150 on tesla.  Made a small profit selling around noon today, but tbh was hoping/ expecting a way bigger move today.  With Elon Musk selling leading into his blackout period for earnings combined with being generally unstable, it def felt like there should have been enough volume and negative sentiment to push through 150 today... yet it held like a brick wall.  The best explanation I have read so far pointed to ([https://maximum-pain.com/options/tsla](https://maximum-pain.com/options/tsla)) stating that the \"market makers\" would lose a lot of money if Tesla was able to push through 150 today which had a rather large spike of open interest and as such had strong incentive to stop that from happening.  So my question to you guys: How are market makers setting up a hard stop like this, and how can I play it better in the future (presuming I want to maximally profit from a reasonably strong confidence in continued downward pressure)?    \n\n\nWithout any more information, I am thinking that in a similar event in the future, I will sell earlier in the day when the iv spiked on the initial drop, then wait till the end of the day and buy weeklies for the following friday at the same or lower strike.  My thought being that market makers are likely buying up whatever volume of TSLA stock to hold the line on friday and accepting the 1:1 loss before unloading on Monday rather than paying out the 100:1 leverage of options that they presumably sold?

{"title": "Comparing penis size can help you understand the CPI", "selftext": "*im too lazy to attach images and such, just a simple explanation, how to guesstimate CPI in bottom. \n\nWhen it comes to CPI, the numbers are deceiving and you can make your own estimates which would be more accurate. \n\n\nUnderstanding YoY CPI: \n\nSo the CPI is an inflation measure, it is measured relative to itself a year ago. So let’s say, this year for November, the CPI was High and last year it was also high. Then this year the CPI will APPEAR a lot less than it really is. \n\nIn penis comparison terms: if you have a small penis and your wife’s boyfriend had a small penis you both would appear average to your wife. Likewise, if you had a big penis and he had a big penis you both would also still appear average to your wife. However we all know, much like true inflation, your wife’s boyfriends penis is HUGE and not just big. Therefore when you compare his HUGE penis with your big penis. He will appear slightly above average to your wife. \n\nThis is just like the YoY cpi. It’s HUGE, massive. But last year we already had hyperinflation so it doesn’t seem to be all that big.\n\n\nMoM: \n\nMoM is critical because it’s like your own penis growth. You measure once every month. So let’s say last month u were 5.1 inches and is growing at .3 inches a month. However all of a sudden your growth is now .15 inches per month. Does that mean your shrinking? Or getting smaller? No, ur still growing. Just slower. \n\nWith CPI MoM is a more accurate measure since it’s more recent and not as relative.\n\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nYou joined WSB in 2019 and your penis was small. You started trading FD’s in 2020 and your penis grew parabolically into 2021, this year you had less money to spend on FD’s but you still had some money so it grew 0.5 inches. Last year your penis was growing parabolically and is huge. This year growth has slowed but it is still huge. When you compare the two your 2022 penis will appear to be slightly above average when in reality compared to the original pre-WSB length it is actually HUGE.\n\n\nTherefore: while CPI is 7.1 it is being compared to an already large CPI so in reality that CPI is like 10 compared to pre hyperinflation.\n\n\nHow to estimate CPI:\n\nSo you take the monthly estimated growth add it to last months growth (trying to estimate how much your penis has grown) and then you subtract last years CPI/penis length. This is how you measure the yearly growth with respect to the updated and decreased monthly growth. \n\nMoM is usually more accurate hence it helped me predict last CPI between 6.9-7.1. Obv u can’t trade this strictly since market does whatever it wants regardless of CPI, sort of like your penis growing but your wife still picking her boyfriend over you because of “he makes me feel special”\n\nObv if there is a large discrepancy in penis size and CPI forecasts estimates vs  reality then your wife just might come back much like how the market is willing to gap up before moving down", "id": "zo6yh6", "created_utc": 1671285877.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|2538|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xaqcj1/why_cpi_will_miss_using_oil_prices_a_conformers/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r6h73h/dnut_rocket_is_leaving_soon_no_shares_left_to_buy/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qppy14/dnut_why_the_downgrades_are_manipulative/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lvkefn/rkt_to_the_moon_the_company_is_intentionally/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xtuyoh/the_freezing_cold_cpi_a_bulls_saving_grace/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: In order to guesstimate CPI, you need to take into account the monthly growth, add it to last months growth, and subtract last years CPI.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "No matter what the size you still get fucked 100% of the time![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "Pls do your DD properly, don’t be lazy, post pics", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Ngl I would flair my post as shitpost if I could but only mods have that power.

Carmack's comments will likely add fuel to this fire.\n\n\"We have a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort,\" Carmack wrote in the memo. \"There is no way to sugar coat this; I think our organization is operating at half the effectiveness that would make me happy.\"\n\n\"I have never been able to kill stupid things before they cause damage, or set a direction and have a team actually stick to it,\" he added in another part of the memo.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nREAD CARMACK'S FULL MEMO: *This is the end of my decade in VR. I have mixed feelings.*\n\n*Quest 2 is almost exactly what I wanted to see from the beginning – mobile hardware, inside out tracking, optional PC streaming, 4k (ish) screen, cost effective. Despite all the complaints I have about our software, millions of people are still getting value out of it. We have a good product. It is successful, and successful products make the world a better place. It all could have happened a bit faster and been going better if different decisions had been made, but we built something pretty close to The Right Thing.*\n\n*The issue is our efficiency.*\n\n*Some will ask why I care how the progress is happening, as long as it is happening?*\n\n*If I am trying to sway others, I would say that an org that has only known inefficiency is ill prepared for the inevitable competition and/or belt tightening, but really, it is the more personal pain of seeing a 5% GPU utilization number in production. I am offended by it.*\n\n*\\[edit: I was being overly poetic here, as several people have missed the intention. As a systems optimization person, I care deeply about efficiency. When you work hard at optimization for most of your life, seeing something that is grossly inefficient hurts your soul. I was likening observing our organization's performance to seeing a tragically low number on a profiling tool.\\]*\n\n*We have a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort. There is no way to sugar coat this; I think out organization is operating at half the effectiveness that would make me happy. Some may scoff and contend we are doing just fine, but others will laugh and say \"Half? Ha! I'm at quarter efficiency!\"*\n\n*It has been a struggle for me. I have a voice at the highest levels here, so it feels like I should be able to move things, but I'm evidently ot persuasive enough. A good Fraction of the things I complain about eventually turn my way after a year or two passes and evidence piles up, but I have never been able to kill stupid things before they cause damage, or set a direction and have a team actually stick to it. I think my influence at the margins has been positive, but it has never been a prime mover.*\n\n*This was admittedly self-inflicted – I could have moved to Menlo Park after the Oculus acquisition and tried to wage battles with generations of leadership, but I was busy programming, and I assumed I would hate it, be bad at it, and probably lose anyway.*\n\n*Enough complaining. I wearied of the fight and have my own startup to run, but the fight is still winnable! VR can bring value to most of the people in the world, and no company is better positioned to do it than Meta. Maybe it is actually possible to get there by just plowing ahead with current practices, but there is plenty of room for improvement.*\n\n*Make better decisions and fill your products with \"Give a Damn!\"*", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "I thought it was an interesting article", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Dude thanks so much for sharing.

Maybe their premium subscriptions would fall a bit, but I'm sure ad revenue would/could even it out. \n\nI passed on making a play on it.

And from spending a decent amount or time on r/Tinder, it's obvious that men are having a terrible time and noone is satisfied with the product.  I sold a naked call last week, so of course the price has ran up and I had to sell a put to manage some risk, hopefully it will stop running up for no reason.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
