When interest rates fall, a currency tends to depreciate, because investors seek higher yields elsewhere.\n\nA weaker dollar boosts companies' revenues when they export goods and services. That could help to prop up stock market earnings next year, according to Detrick.\n\n\"40% of revenues come from overseas for the S&P 500, so a weaker dollar like we're anticipating could be a little bit of a tailwind for earnings actually coming in better than people think,\" he said.\n\nWall Street's top banks aren't so bullish on stock market earnings.\n\nBank of America and Morgan Stanley both said at the start of December that they're expecting companies to downgrade their targets as the threat of a recession leads to a fall in spending.\n\nThey forecast that the benchmark S&P 500 will fall as low as 3,000 points in the first quarter, which would represent a 23% plunge from its level as of Tuesday's close.\n\nBut Detrick is more optimistic. He said that a combination of the weak dollar, inflation starting to fall towards the Federal Reserve's 2% target, and the US economy managing to avoid a recession could fuel a stock market surge.\n\n\"I think I'm open to the idea that we could have a surprise rally in the first half of next year with inflation coming back and the economy not going into recession,\" he told Yahoo Finance. \n\n\"Everybody is bearish,\" Detrick added. \"Markets have a funny way of surprising the masses.\"", "id": "zth8es", "created_utc": 1671806093.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "Weak dollar?

In 6-8 months the YOY is likely to be 3% or lower. That's going to surprise a lot of people who don't realize how measuring trailing inflation effects YOY so heavily.\n\n2) The Fed hates having high rates. Inflation is a blessing in disguise for them because they shed a lot of debt, but they can't simply raise rates over and over, else they lose their whole advantage of inflation in the first place. The key for them is to take a lot (inflation) and give back a little (rates). Unless they're doing a completely policy shift, rates will come down within the next year or so.\n\n3) War in Ukraine can end in a flash. Will it? No one knows, but that will be a big catalyst whether it makes sense or not.\n\n4) China is coming out of their COVID nonsense. They're going to be hyper focused on clawing back some economic output they lost over this.\n\n5) This Fed scare is going to balance out all our supply chain ups and downs. Companies are going to have to get back to a sweet spot between supply/demand, and they have every incentive to do so because they want to keep earnings looking decent.\n\nThe real kicker is that all of these things are actively in place or on the horizon.

He also confirmed that savings over the cost of operating conventional big rigs would pay them back over that duration.\n\nO'Connell went on to outline the company is moving Frito-Lay \"food products\" on routes within a 425-mile range, while trucks carrying the heavier PepsiCo soda cans were confined to shorter routes within 100 miles.

At one point, the Dow fell more than 800 points before a late-day push helped the blue-chip index finish down about 350 points. It was a particularly bad day for tech stocks, which dragged the Nasdaq down nearly 2.2%. With just five trading days left in December, stocks are on the cusp of finishing 2022 in the red, potentially wrapping up the worst year for equities since 2008. Alphabet’s Google told employees that more of them will be at risk of low performance ratings in 2023, according to internal communications obtained by CNBC’s Jennifer Elias. The company estimates that its new evaluation system would put 6% of full-time workers into a category that carries higher risk for corrective action. It was 2% previously. The system will also make it harder for employees to score high marks.\n\nWatchlist - PFE - Healthcare has been the outperforming sector over the past couple months.

{"title": "An Economy in Motion", "selftext": "**TLDR;** *Our market cycle is nearing its end. I won't pretend to know the direction of the market tomorrow, or the next day, only that it's just about time for the story of our current economy to come to an end. Inflation will turn into deflation, and valuations will seek equilibrium with macroeconomic conditions. Crisis in the treasury and asset markets may erupt simultaneously forcing the FED to make the impossible decision of what to do next.*\n\n***SUAV (Shut Up Asshole Version);*** *Market go down, then market go up, then market go down again for last time. No more gains for a few years, and then probably gains again.* \n\n**THE ECONOMIC BODY:**\n\nThe economy, much like our own internal processes, is constantly seeking equilibrium and homeostasis to ensure internal stability. When one sector of the economy fails, another may step in to \"recalibrate\". Every vein carries capital to the Central Bank, and every artery distributes that capital back into the economy. However, the flow of capital isn't perfectly linear. For the economic body to function, it must make \"pit stops\" along the way to delegate resources and ensure that all of its parts have enough nutrients to operate. \n\n***If one of these economic limbs becomes cut off from the supply of capital it may become necrotic, requiring emergency intervention to save it. Inversely, an area of the economy that receives too great a flow of capital risks rupturing its own supply lines.*** \n\nOur bodies are resilient and they can take a surprising amount of punishment without succumbing completely. We can survive for weeks without food and days without water. Of course our bodies still \\*need\\* these things, but for short periods of time, we can survive without them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5klm20ev2p7a1.png?width=1461&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba075248b9c5efe296124356613931c8c22e79f0\n\nAbove are periods that exemplify this resilience in action. Each grey line represents an economic recession, and subsequent dip in the market's overall \"health\" (GDP). Recovery is inevitable, and the market eventually continues business as usual. It has become so common that investment firms typically attempt to price them years before they occur. In the 1990s, it can be assumed that traders during the peak of the tech asset bubble had reasonable education in the mania of the 1920s and the crash that followed. **Therefore, it is safe to assume that the high likelihood of a 1929-type scenario happening again was priced in**. They probably understood the risks but made the conscious decision that the reward was well worth the cost. \n\n2008, on the other hand, was a different beast entirely. It was the first time in modern history that this \\*specific\\* type of market crash occurred. \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jnpku8qb6p7a1.png?width=1441&format=png&auto=webp&s=a94d32ac4d853fc4e25cc4c416dd7c544403dd16\n\nThe frequency that mania occurs within asset markets is well-researched and widely understood. As intangible assets, these are relatively well-contained in terms of the fallout produced. Maybe a poor sap or investment firm loses their 401k or goes bankrupt in the process, but hey that's ***capitalism baby***. \n\nWhen a crisis occurs in tangible assets, like the housing market, the entire population feels its effects. People lose the largest asset, source of credit, and/or physical shelter they have. This is what made the events of 2008 so catastrophic. ***Intangible assets crossed over into the realm of tangible assets.*** Banks weren't trading physical houses, but they might as well have been as the underlying contracts were directly linked to home values themselves. People who signed onto a mortgage were completely unaware that their homes were being immediately converted into a derivative and sold. Their entire life savings, means of sustaining themselves and their families, and creditworthiness were all traded multiple times per day by hundreds of banks. \n\n *And \\*almost\\* nobody knew.*\n\n**AN ECONOMY IN MOTION:**\n\nBy now, I'm sure you're wondering what the point of this all is. We've all opened a history book at one point or another, and have certainly read about various market crashes on the internet. There are hundreds of thousands of opinions, hot takes, and research articles posted every day that offer us a plethora of byte-sized options to choose from when making our next investment. We make the assumption that somewhere in the chain of command, the final individual with the power and authority to decide the fate of our economy is impartial and completely rational. Even if the responsibility gets passed to the next person, eventually it will land on the desk of someone who will make the \"right\" decision. Unfortunately, complacency is the end result of this unstoppable force meeting an immovable object.   \n\nThe fields of economics and finance are so incredibly difficult to decipher because banks and financial entities have taken the basic fundamentals of economics and manipulated them into a monstrous beast. In times of crisis, complex concepts like derivatives, synthetic swaps, covered calls, covered puts, iron condor, beta, theta, and gamma become irrelevant. The terms are still used, but the only question on anyone's mind is; \"Who has money, how much of it, and how can I get it\". \n\nAn economy that is flourishing is free to assign valuations at will. Arbitrary intangible assets become a rewarding place to store cash, and debts that exist in the tangible world remain readily paid. Intangible assets and goodwill become reasonable collateral for lines of credit, and optimism is high. \n\n*However,*  \n\nAn economy in crisis rejects arbitrary valuations and disregards anything on balance sheets that cannot be directly converted into spendable cash necessary to pay one's tangible debt. Assets that do not provide immediate liquidity are marked down significantly, and lines of credit that were once reliable dry up entirely. Although the tale of economic prosperity took months or years to tell, the final chapter of the story comes to an end with a single moment inside the truth.\n\n  \n\n[Personal savings rate](https://preview.redd.it/ailfnkcfmp7a1.png?width=1457&format=png&auto=webp&s=21ced97e8e15a0bb3737c0f0fb0fb4562964adb6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Amount of Treasury securities sold in RRP](https://preview.redd.it/4l0k88pbnp7a1.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b39db8d7b997b5f53db2ce07d5dc6b94ce7772d)\n\nUsing these charts, we can create our own scenario for the economy. \n\n1.) As savings dry up, people will become more mindful of what they spend their money on. As home prices fall, lines of credit and creditworthiness to consumers will be re-evaluated. Default rates rise in credit cards and mortgage payments.  \n\n2.) Businesses will be forced to decrease prices across the board as they are forced to manage with the little consumers have left to spend. SPACs that have not completed a merger will fail to do so, as capital constricts.\n\n3.) Major indices will fall to below pre-pandemic levels as overleveraged positions unwind in the opposite direction of the euphoric rise. Unprofitable companies and companies without positive operating revenues will most likely delist or go bankrupt.\n\n4.) Massive redemption orders will cause a liquidity crisis among ETFs and index funds.\n\n5.) The FED will be forced to take emergency action during an unprecedented time and when they are already managing a liquidity crisis of their own in treasuries. \n\n6.) Major indexes will stay suppressed for years, below finally returning to normal levels.   \n\nAlthough I understand this sounds like FUD, it is a process that we have gone through before. **The uncertainty comes with the fact that the entities in place to manage such crises have never been in the position to do so when they are already managing a liquidity crisis of their own.** They may be forced to decide between saving their treasury market, saving the stock market, or coming up with another tool entirely. History tells us that markets will recover, but will most likely look very different compared to what we currently know. \n\n*Good luck, Buckle up, and save your money. It's about to be a wild ride.*", "id": "zttwjh", "created_utc": 1671832956.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|457|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x9z1re/beware_lowvolume_rallies_the_final_fib/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vvvfxj/shorting_progressive_pgr_a_comprehensive_review/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zprox5/the_winding_road_of_capital/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xl0fa8/final_thesis_for_equities/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w8hw15/its_time_to_long_the_vix_vixy_supporting_thesis/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xpf6oz/brief_relief_rally_followup/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vvbzz7/a_beautiful_short_position_in_the_making_pgr/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xlw8ux/potential_for_future_brief_relief/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zttwjh/an_economy_in_motion/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So full send?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.
