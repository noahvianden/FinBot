They currently have a monopoly as these are insanely complex and expensive machines (think many many step process to end up with a super pure special laser at the end). ASML will stay a monopoly barring industrial espionage etc so they will tend to go up so long as chip demand is high.\nINTC/AMD: The two main X86 players. They've gone back and forth for decades. INTC tries to fab in house (but also buys some TSMC). AMD used to fab but now primarily goes through TSMC.\nNVDA: Wants to get into CPU's (has the Tegras and tried to buy ARM) but mostly the mackdaddy king of GPU (because they made CUDA the industry standard). In gaming AMD competes well (comparable GPUs) but in AI AMD has put up a poor effort (no CUDA competitor).\nTSMC: The best fab today. Fabbing is extremely expensive (i.e. need massive massive capital to buy tons of ASML's machines and other such tools). Fabbing is essentially series of processes (chemical baths, laser treatments etc) to purify down a ton of silicon to a wafer and then one way or another (chemical, laser etc) carve circuits into it. Each step can have losses and tiny impurities can ruin the die. Because of how capital intensive it is, it tends to be winner take all. Whoever has the best fab will have folks want to fab with them ==>money to invest in the next gen of fab.\n\nAMD vs INTC as leader: INTC was leader until ~2014ish. Then under poor leadership they made some critical mistakes. They didn't get into EUV for their process, they didn't invest enough in R&D etc. During that time TSMC got ahead of INTC in process and AMD came up with some important architectural innovations: chiplets. Make tiny chiplets that piece together (like ultra complex legos) rather than giant monolithic chips. The chiplets are easier to make (so yield is much improved) but you do pay a price (there's performance/energy cost making the interconnects between the chips).\n\nRight now...INTC leads on desktop CPU...because they made their chip bigger in silicon (i.e. brute force) AND because AMD came out with their last version ~1.5 years ago. But desktop doesn't matter. The money is in Data Center. DC only cares about performance per watt (because higher watts==>higher heat==>higher space taken up). Right now AMD is undisputed leader of DC and Intel THEMSELVES have published material stating they won't have performance per watt supremacy until 2024 or so (meaning any investment in Intel is optimistically going to be dead money until then).", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Asianometry on Youtube for semis has a substack too I think", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "The good thing about oil is if we ever run low, we can just print more.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "> One of my favorite books from some time ago was 'The World Is Flat' by Thomas Friedman.\n\nStep one, figure out why this shouldn’t be one of your favorite books", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "To be fair to me, I read this in high school.

The misuse of fundamental terms is very worrying for someone playing with options.\n\nSecond, this is not a \"Robinhood\" specific phenomenon, as everyone is quick to jump to. Any time someone is trading on margin, they have to first agree to the broker's right to liquidate your positions. ALL brokers do this. They may have different risk management algorithms, but their right to liquidate without warning is there.\n\nFinally, to your question. Your position was liquidated because you likely lacked the buying power to take assignment. And before you say \"but vertical spreads have limited loss\" - it doesn't matter when you're that close to expiry. Yes, margin requirement is only width of the spread when far from expiry, but when you're close like this and you open yourself to pin risk, that no longer applies.\n\nLet's say TSLA ended 824. Your long put expires worthless. You get assigned on your short. Maybe you're looking at a loss of only $100 minus premium received - maybe you even have a small win, but you need $82,500 in capital to take assignment, then hold the position until Tuesday and pray TSLA didn't move up or down to realize that. If you don't have that capital, the broker is unwilling to lend you that amount of money, so they liquidate your position before it even gets close.\n\nTake this further - let's say TSLA ended the day at 824 but it dropped over the weekend to 810. Your 815 long put expires worthless, so is unable to protect you. You may end up losing more than $1000 in your spread.\n\nAlways close your position if you're unwilling or unable to take assignment.

Yes is short selling ok in the market? sure, but is it needed to find true value of a company? No it isn’t. \n\nMost economists would say supply and demand is the truest sense of finding fair value,  then borrowing a stock from someone and selling said stock to buy back cheaper. \n\nwhy not stop buying underlying stock and have more sell pressure would fix most valuations. Most of the problem with short selling is there’s very little data about how much borrowing is going on. Like are we borrowing 1 share from someone who owns that underlying stock? Or is that share a borrow and then the person borrows that share that already is a borrow? \n\nWe get such late reports it’s to late to tell since reporting comes month back when the short can close out there position before reporting and open a new one. \n\nSo tldr: short selling in the market does have some use, but does it find fair value of a company? No. \n\nIs it a necessary component needed to find bad companies? No again cause one can just not buy there stock, price goes down due to supply and demand. \n\nIssues with short selling reporting and holding bad actors who abuse by borrowing a borrowed share creating things like naked shorting. These can cause violent moves in the market such as short squeezes. Which aren’t healthy for markets. \n\nAll in all short selling isn’t needed for a fair and open market but does have some use.
