The technology sector led the bounce as the beginning of the Russian invasion seemed to cool bets on a 50bps hike in March. \n\nMarkets have been pricing-in an increasingly hawkish Fed this year, but with the prospect of a larger-scale conflict clouding economic outlook, the US central bank might look to begin their tightening cycle on a tamer note. Given the amount of bearish pressure tech stocks have already come under in recent weeks, any chance of a more modest approach from the Fed is likely to cause $NDX to rebound over the short-term, and potentially form some sort of a low at the current levels. \n\nHowever, it is still too early judge the impact the Russia-Ukraine conflict may have, and with PCE data also due on Friday, speculation for an aggressive policy approach could quickly return. Speaking earlier, Fed member Waller stated that there is still a strong case for a 50bps hike in March if the economy shows signs of overheating. Therefore, $NDX, and the broader market, could possibly see losses accelerate into the weekend if tonight‚Äôs inflation print is hot enough. \n\nIt‚Äôll be interesting to see how the market reacts to the data release, as well as the situation in Eastern Europe and how the West chooses to respond.

{"title": "Key inflation gauge hit 6.1% in January, highest since 1982", "selftext": " An inflation gauge that is closely monitored by the Federal Reserve jumped 6.1% in January compared with a year ago, the latest evidence that Americans are enduring sharp price increases that will likely worsen after Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe figure reported [Friday by the Commerce Department ](https://www.bea.gov/sites/default/files/2022-02/pi0122.pdf)was the largest year-over-year rise since 1982. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, core inflation increased 5.2% in January from a year earlier.\n\nRobust consumer spending has combined with widespread product and worker shortages to create the highest inflation in four decades ‚Äî a heavy burden for U.S. households, especially lower-income families faced with elevated costs for food, fuel and rent.\n\nAt the same time, consumers as a whole largely shrugged off the higher prices last month and boosted their spending 2.1% from December to January, Friday‚Äôs report said, an encouraging sign for the economy and the job market. That was a sharp improvement from December, when spending fell. Americans across the income scale have been receiving pay raises and have amassed more savings than they had before the pandemic struck two years ago. That expanded pool of savings provides fuel for future spending.\n\nInflation, though, is expected to remain high and perhaps accelerate in the coming months, especially with Russia‚Äôs invasion likely disrupting oil and gas exports. The costs of other commodities that are produced in Ukraine, such as wheat and aluminum, have also increased.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Thursday that he would do ‚Äúeverything I can‚Äù to keep gas prices in check. Biden did not spell out details, though he mentioned the possibility of releasing more oil from the nation‚Äôs strategic reserves. He also warned that oil and gas companies ‚Äúshould not exploit this moment‚Äù by raising prices at the pump.\n\nOn Friday, oil prices were steady after they had reached $100 a barrel in volatile trading on Thursday, before falling back to $92, about where they had started the day. Still, economists at JPMorgan have forecast that oil could reach $110 a barrel as Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine escalates. Economists at BMO Capital Markets have estimated that each $10-a-barrel increase translates into a 0.4 percentage point rise in inflation.\n\nA [separate report Friday ](https://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3/adv/pdf/durgd.pdf)showed that orders for long-lasting factory goods rose sharply in January, led by a rise in demand for airplanes. The figures indicate that many companies are willing to invest more in industrial equipment and other goods, a sign of confidence in the economy.\n\n‚ÄúOverall, the real economy appears to be in stronger health than we feared,‚Äù said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics, a forecasting firm.\n\nIncomes were unchanged last month, largely because the monthly child tax credit payments that were included in Biden‚Äôs $1.9 trillion financial support package expired. A [new study concluded ](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-health-poverty-columbia-university-0974fed3323ec98a75998817815f4af1)that the end of the payments led to a jump in child poverty.\n\nBut wages and salaries rose 0.5% from December to January, Friday‚Äôs report showed. And Social Security payments increased because a large cost-of-living adjustment, reflecting last year‚Äôs jump in inflation, took effect.\n\nRussia‚Äôs invasion and the likely resulting rise in inflation have increased pressure on the Federal Reserve, which is expected to raise interest rates by a quarter-point as many as five or six times this year beginning in March. The Fed‚Äôs delicate task ‚Äî to raise rates enough to restrain inflation, without going so far as to tip the economy into recession ‚Äî has now become more difficult.\n\nHigher gas prices typically accelerate inflation, which would heighten the need for rate increases. But costlier gas can also weaken the economy by slowing consumer spending, something that would normally lead the Fed to leave rates unchanged.\n\nFed officials are acknowledging that the invasion of Ukraine has complicated the economic outlook, but say that so far they are sticking with their plans for rate hikes.\n\nLoretta Mester, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said Thursday that she supported a series of rate hikes beginning in March. But she said the Fed should remain flexible: Faster rate hikes might be needed, she said, if inflation hasn‚Äôt begun to fade by mid-year, or more gradual increases if inflation is slowing.\n\n‚ÄúThe implications of the unfolding situation in Ukraine for the medium-run economic outlook in the U.S. will also be a consideration,‚Äù she said. Other Fed officials have offered similar remarks this week.\n\nLate Thursday, Fed governor Christopher Waller [said he would support a half-point rate hike](https://apnews.com/article/business-california-economy-prices-santa-barbara-cb630033a2e427dbc35d54a72ca3d81f) in March if inflation remains high. Most other Fed policymakers, though, have indicated that they‚Äôre inclined to favor a more typical quarter-point hike.\n\nFed officials want inflation to fall back to its 2% target, as measured by the Commerce Department‚Äôs gauge, released Friday. A separate measure, the consumer price index, released two weeks ago, showed that inflation reached 7.5% in January from a year earlier, also a four-decade high.\n\nIn December, Fed officials projected that inflation would decline to just 2.6%, according to their preferred measure, by the end of this year, which most economists see as increasingly unlikely. The Fed will release updated projections at its March meeting.\n\nJanuary‚Äôs data show inflation was already picking up before the invasion. From December to January, prices rose 0.6%, up from 0.5% in the previous month.\n\nA [Federal Reserve report Friday showed ](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20220225_mprfullreport.pdf)that inflation has spread beyond pandemic-affected industries, such as new and used cars, in which prices have jumped at double-digit annual rates. More than three-fifths of all goods and services are now showing price gains of at least 3% a year, the Fed said, nearly double the pre-pandemic level. At the same time, that is still far below the proportion in the 1970s, when more than 90% of goods and services reflected price increases at least that high, the report said.\n\nThere are early indications that consumer spending has stayed healthy in February, boosted by the rapid fading of the omicron wave of the coronavirus. JPMorgan Chase said that spending on its credit cards for airline tickets, hotel rooms, and restaurant meals rose in the first half of this month.\n\nThe JPMorgan Chase Institute also recently released data showing that cash balances remain elevated among their customers, including those with lower incomes. Bank account balances for Americans with less than $26,000 in income were 65% higher at the end of last year than they were two years before.\n\nThe combination of higher pay and enhanced savings suggests that Americans may be able to keep spending at a solid pace in the coming months, thereby sustaining the economy‚Äôs inflationary pressures.\n\n [Key inflation gauge hit 6.1% in January, highest since 1982 | AP News](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-europe-prices-inflation-e44ad9b2088aa352015868a4f6b17785)", "id": "t1gwik", "created_utc": 1645829468.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|9|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t1gwik)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t1gwik)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good for 60% of the aging population.

That doesn't eliminate the bias that was created by the first set of confirming events, it makes the psyche even more engaged in that bias for some people. Psychologically inconsistent reinforcement is the strongest, which is why casinos have win streaks. If you lose 60% of the time, but the wins are big and feel important, you can absolutely drain people and they will happily invest in that draining...\n\n...and that's where a lot of this is coming from.

The market might be different; people might be different. \n\nFor example, we've had two big changes in the last few months - the Fed recognizing inflation as a major problem, and now this war which may get bigger and/or lead to more wars.
