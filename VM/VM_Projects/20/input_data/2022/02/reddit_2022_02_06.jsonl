{"title": "Calendar Spread vs. Diagonal Spread vs. Debit Spread for Spec Directional Plays?", "selftext": "Much appreciated to those that can help me.  I'm going to use AAPL as an example but generally I am looking at this type of question for my moves going forward.  I've had decent success buying pretty far OTM debit spreads and closing them out before expiration for some decent gains.  My only issue is that sometimes due to how far OTM I am buying them to keep costs down, I am closing them for less than I would like in order to keep a profit on the trade because the move takes longer than I had hoped to set up.  In short, despite being theta-neutralish, the amount of theta burn isn't offset by the delta move come the actual move.\n\nWith that in mind, I have been reading up more on calendar and diagonal spreads, where I buy more extrinsic and sell fast theta, essentially, without losing the strong delta and vega positivity that can sometimes come with other short-leg component trades (like credit spreads).  \n\nIf I think that AAPL over the next few months is going to see new ATH, as an example, and I want to buy the Apr. 14th $175 call and then sell some further OTM calls to walk down the cost basis, what am I gaining and losing with a calendar vs. a diagonal vs. a straight CDS?  \n\nI understand with the CDS I am I am severely limiting my upside if there is a larger than expected move at the benefit of having a secured stop in the amount of premium paid.  However, going far enough OTM, allows me to buy these in multiples and more than make up for the upside cap without increasing the account risk.  The Diagonal is the same thing but has the benefit of if AAPL chops sideways I am short-term theta aggressive so I can make some sort of money even if AAPL doesn't move.  The Calendar is the one I am the most unsure of as I haven't done one before.  It appears to offer a safer amount of risk but at the detriment of tightening the profitable window to the upside, that if you cross a threshold you lose faster than a diagonal.\n\nIs there anything secret I need to also know?  My whole idea is not predictions about shrinking or increasing IV, just purely directional and how can I get the most return out of something with the lowest cost that is still more safe than buying 20 $220 calls and hoping for the best.\n\nThanks!", "id": "slykby", "created_utc": 1644159377.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "At the risk of sounding like a peasant.  \n\nI believe the further out should be ITM and the ones you sell should be the max extrinsic value you can get for a 30-45d expiration.

I would pay about $34.90. See my short call can easily become OTM, so if that happens and AAPL falls to say, $154.90 by the expiry of the short call, for strong stocks which I have faith in, to drop this much, represents a dip and potential to go back quickly. I’ll buy the stock and hold it, continue to sell CC on them. Once the price goes back to say $160 at the supposedly expiry of my long call, liquidate if you must take profit, or keep it and keep selling CC if you are happy to own it. And if the short call doesn’t expire OTM, I’ll just keep repeating until I get AAPL on the cheap. So that’s 1 approach for me. \n\nSometimes I take the opposite: sell 120C and buy 160C same expiry, while AAPL is at $165. I will get paid less than $40, say $39.50 due to higher extrinsic value paid on my long call. If AAPL falls to 150 at the short call’s expiry, profit = $120 + $39.50 - $150 = $9.50. And if it doesn’t fall, I probably lose out on transaction fee of literally $1.35, but that’s worth the fees for me. \n\nAs for short puts, the market is a bit volatile so I’m mostly on PMCC positions since Dec.

January 24th marked the lows of the recent selloff. SPY is higher by about 7% since then, with the VIX down more than 40%.

Amidst that backdrop have been some fairly eye-popping moves following earnings. Meta/Facebook and Amazon were two of the largest mega-cap earnings moves in recent memory. As stated a few weeks ago, earnings during a high implied vol environment can have unique characteristics. From Jan 23rd:\n\n*Options have a harder time pricing near-term events. Earnings are a great example. If overall market volatility is at or below historical averages, the expected move for an event like earnings is almost entirely pricing that day’s potential move. But in a case where options are pricing potential market moves of over 3% for the week, options need to account for potential market moves in the days leading up to or after the event. A company reporting earnings may see 80% of its potential move reflected in its options premium with the VIX 16, but it may be closer to only 50% with the VIX above 30. There’s also the potential for outsized moves to the downside on earnings while market sentiment is so poor. This is the “shoot first, ask questions later” phenomenon. Netflix earnings last week are an example. Another effect of elevated vol is that short gamma in the market can accentuate near term and intraday moves.*\n\nMeta’s move was an example like Netflix, with a massive move lower following disappointing news. But on the flipside, Amazon blew out its results and saw a massive move higher. The options market wasn’t even close to correctly pricing either possibility, and there was a lot of short gamma in the options market to help supercharge those moves. SNAP also saw a massive move higher, albeit in a much smaller market cap situation than AMZN.\n\n## Earnings\n\n*Links* go to the Options AI calendar where you can see the other companies each day and click through to see charts (free to use).
