Why markets worried about interest rate hikes?", "selftext": "THE REAL REASON NO ONE TELLS YOU!!!\n\nUS Stock market is in honeymoon period after 2008 crash, low interest rates and free money, this is good for businesses as they borrow money and create new employment and grow(this is how economies work). Same applies for the companies as they raise more cash by selling junk bonds. For example Tesla was a Zombie company in 2014 and they sold  huge junk bonds to run the company as they cannot issue more common shares as it affects the stock price. \nThe other side, the buyers are who lend the money from FED Reverse repo with almost 0% and buy these for high returns in exchange of their treasury bonds with FED!\n\nUnderstand this, when reverse repo rates go up these zombie companies run out of cash as the above gambling is not worth it and that’s when growth will slow down and it trigger the recession and people do less spending and inflation also goes down during that period.

When the borrow gets more expensive the lend spread needs to go up for the trade to make sense. Bond prices need to go down, which hurts those currently in the trade. \n\nThis also hurts the weakest companies because they can’t afford to pay a little more when they roll over their debt but everyone else can. That is supposed to happen and is one way higher rates impact the economy. \n\nWhen the trade goes wrong it’s usually because the price of bonds fall and traders cant or won’t stay in the trade. Then they sell their bonds but there may not be anybody to buy and prices go into free fall. This is a credit crisis. It is usually triggered by concerns about the creditworthiness of the bonds rather than the borrow cost.\n\nI wouldn’t worry about rate rise causing this, but anything that makes investors want out of the credit carry trade could start a credit problem.
