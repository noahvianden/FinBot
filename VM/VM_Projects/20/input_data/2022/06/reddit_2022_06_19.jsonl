Then it went to $1500 and u sold you just made money and didn't loose anything. U lost 1000 USD for some BTC when u bought it and u lost some BTC for some USD when you sold.

What I'd recommend though is size the width of the strikes as your max risk per trade based on a percentage of your total account size as per the Kelly criterion (not exactly the Kelly criterion but mathematically similar).  For example, if I have a $100k account and I want my max risk per trade to be 3%, then that means I want to risk $3k per trade at most.  This means that my spread should be at most 30 points wide.  Based on this, if I now have a specific percentage of the width of my strike I now have my max strike width and now I can calculate on a specific underlying if I can open a spread 30 points wide where I will collect however much I want to collect (30%, 50%, doesn't matter just pick a number).  Given a particular underlying, I can now calculate whether or not I want to open the trade based on my profit goals and risk management strategy.  Alternatively, I could plug this into some sort of stock and option scanner and it would output a bunch of underlyings that could potentially meet my criteria that I may want to open a spread against.  As a very, very, very general rule though for me personally I'll take 10% of the stock's current value and if that's less than or equal to the width of my strike then it's probably worthwhile for me to consider trading it.  If it's not, then I probably shouldn't be trading it.  That's totally arbitrary as the greeks will determine the actual viability of a particular width for a spread, however I've used this as a setting for a stock picker as the maximum underlying price and I've found that to be effective as a filter for my particular strategy.  It's also really easy to adjust; you just plug in your account size, your max risk per trade, your profit targets, and then scan for stocks that fall around those numbers and enter/exit the trade when the math dictates that you should.  Way safer than trading randomly or getting all emotional.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "What screener do you use?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I use ToS currently but I've used a couple of other more specific screeners online in the past.
