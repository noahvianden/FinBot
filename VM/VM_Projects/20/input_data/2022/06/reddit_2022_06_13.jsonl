Wages won't drop and businesses are unlikely to cut prices once they've increased them. Commodity prices can come down though.\n\n\\> It’s not as if food, gas, etc will drop in price enough for CPI to decline in a few months. All we can hope is that they stop climbing.\n\nThat's what the market is looking for. We all know CPI is going to be high for a while, but if it's peaked and is coming back down we can at least have some certainty over the trajectory of future inflation and rate hikes. At the moment we don't know if inflation has peaked and we don't how high rates might need to go before it peaks -- and that's a huge risk for equity valuations.\n\n\\> I don’t believe there really is a 1:1 correlation with the stock market here. And these prices might be here to stay. Stock investors may be reacting to recession fears instead of CPI.\n\nIt's both an adjustment to expected higher rates and a slowdown / decline in earnings growth. If CPI remains hot we can expect the Fed to get more aggressive and that means higher rates and increased recession risk. It's a double whammy for stock valuations. What's worrying is that we've not really priced in much recession risk just yet. Most of the move in the market can be attributed to higher rates alone. We could go significantly lower if we start pricing in a decline in earnings on top of rate hikes.\n\n-------\n\nI think the market has been surprised that inflation has remained so persistant, but imo it's far too early to know what impact rate hikes will have. There's currently a lot of pent-up demand and consumers are dealing with higher prices with savings they've built up over the last couple of years. I think towards the end of summer we should expect to see things start slow as savings decline and demand begins to drop. If inflation remains high into fall then I'd start to worry, but right now I think the market is probably overreacting. We all knew people wanted to spend this summer and they have the savings to do it regardless of what the Fed is doing. We have to acknowledge that people have been stuck at home for two years, so they're unlikely to cancel their summer plans for a third year because the Fed has hiked rates a it and fuel prices have increased. I also think this is why we're seeing such a large gap between demand and consumer sentiment.

The nature of auto is to keep variants down because you’re supporting hem for a couple decades, so this naturally plays in to that simple supportability.\n\nAs a side benefit, Apple gets to practice at cars and brain rape the industry as a trusted partner to see what works and what doesn’t, before stabbing them in the back and being able to do it better themselves once they’ve perfected it and also build the hardware, where they could deploy a completely different OS they don’t give to anyone else and tune it further because they control the whole package. \n\nAlso Google is doing it, so if they don’t the cede the space to Android…", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, back when Steve was there", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "How long has CarPlay existed?\n\nI'll tell you, eight years.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Yeah agreed won’t be hard to see them have all other cars have fully UI controls like a Tesla and self driving.

In April, U.S. consumer prices surged 8.3% — down slightly from 8.5% in March, but still near 40-year highs.\n\nSpiking inflation has severe consequences for your cash savings.\n\nFortunately, investing legend Warren Buffett has [plenty of advice](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/5-top-quotes-from-berkshire-hathaways-shareholder-meeting) on what to own when consumer prices spike.\n\nIn a 1981 letter to shareholders, Buffett highlighted two business traits that investors should look for when trying to fight inflation: 1) the power to increase prices easily, and 2) the ability to take on more business without having to spend excessively.\n\nHere are four Berkshire holdings that largely boast those characteristics.\n\n## American Express (AXP)\n\nLast year, American Express demonstrated its pricing power as it raised the annual fee on its Platinum Card from $550 to $695.\n\nThe company also stands to directly benefit in an inflationary environment.\n\nAmerican Express makes most of its money through discount fees — merchants are charged a percentage of every Amex card transaction. As the price of goods and services increases, the company gets to take a cut of larger bills.\n\nBusiness is booming. In Q1, the company’s revenue jumped 29% year over year to $11.7 billion.\n\nAmerican Express is the fifth-largest holding at Berkshire Hathaway. Owning 151.6 million shares of AXP, Berkshire’s stake is worth nearly $24 billion.\n\nBerkshire also owns shares of American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard, although the positions are much smaller.\n\nAmerican Express shares currently offer a dividend yield of 1.3%.\n\n \n\n## Coca-Cola (KO)\n\nCoca-Cola is a classic example of a [recession-resistant](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/jim-rogers-warns-big-collapse-and-recession) business. Whether the economy is booming or struggling, a can of Coke is affordable to most people.\n\nThe company’s entrenched market position, massive scale, and portfolio of iconic brands — including names like Sprite, Fresca, Dasani and Smartwater — give it plenty of pricing power.\n\nAdd solid geographic diversification — its products are sold in more than 200 countries and territories around the globe — and it’s clear that Coca-Cola can thrive through thick and thin. After all, the company went public more than 100 years ago.\n\nBuffett has held Coca-Cola in his portfolio since the late ’80s. Today, Berkshire owns 400 million shares of the company, worth approximately $25.8 billion.\n\nYou can lock in a dividend yield of 2.7% on Coca-Cola's shares at current prices.\n\n \n\n## Apple (AAPL)\n\nNo one who spends $1,600 for a fully decked-out iPhone 13 Pro Max would call it a steal. But consumers love splurging on Apple products anyway.\n\nEarlier last year, management revealed that the company’s active installed base of hardware has surpassed 1.65 billion devices, including over 1 billion iPhones.\n\nWhile competitors offer cheaper devices, many consumers don’t want to live outside the Apple ecosystem. That means, as inflation spikes, Apple can pass higher costs to its global consumer base without worrying too much about a drop in sales volume.\n\nToday, Apple is Buffett’s largest publicly traded holding, representing nearly 40% of Berkshire’s portfolio by market value. Of course, the sheer increase in Apple’s stock price is one of the reasons for that concentration. Over the past five years, shares of the tech gorilla have surged more than 280%.\n\nApple currently offers a dividend yield of 0.6%.\n\n \n\n## Chevron (CVX)\n\nOne of Buffett’s big moves in 2022 is loading up on Chevron. According to an SEC filing, Berkshire owned $25.9 billion of the energy giant as of Mar. 31 — a significant jump from its stake of $4.5 billion at the end of 2021.\n\nToday, Chevron represents the third-largest public holding at Berkshire.\n\nIt’s not difficult to understand why. Even though the oil business is capital intensive, it tends to do very well during periods of high inflation.\n\nOil — the most heavily traded commodity globally — has soared 45% year to date. And the supply shock caused by [Russia’s invasion of Ukraine](https://moneywise.com/investing/stocks/ukraine-invasion-protect-your-portfolio) could keep that trend going.\n\nStrong oil prices benefit oil producers. Chevron’s latest quarterly earnings more than quadrupled year over year. The stock is up nearly 40% in 2022.\n\nThe company returns cash to investors, too. Paying quarterly dividends of $1.42 per share, Chevron has an annual yield of 3.4%.", "id": "vbez2o", "created_utc": 1655134632.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|87|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|147|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sq4ocs/dkng_updated_morgan_stanley_detailed_analysis_as/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ush4pz/suspicious_of_an_analyst_buy_rating_on_risky_bio/) \n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vbez2o)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vbez2o)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Omg Warren buffet recommends buying apple?
