{"title": "Vancouver housing", "selftext": "https://www.zolo.ca/vancouver-real-estate/trends\n\nVancouver’s housing market is down 15% this past quarter. I even saw a house on Redfin that was selling for LESS than what they bought it for 2 years ago. That’s pretty unheard of as of 10 years. \n\nSo- If a bubble was to pop- the pinprick would start with FED raising rates. Which yes has happened. \nBut it is investors-the whales- that will really move price. In the past 3-4 years investors such as Blackrock have gobbled up at least 25-30% real estate. That percentage gets even worse in some metro areas- like Austin, Texas. \n\nMy opinion is that Chinese investors will be the first of investors to exit. Why? Because they have found safety in American and Canadian RE to escape the volatility of the Yuan/Xi. (I don’t blame them). They’ll get to going while the getting is good- since they have made some equity and rental returns. \n\nPhase 2- All the other investors will head for the exit while prices are dropping and after foreign money has exited first. After that, regular class citizens and their home prices will be affected. *Stock market is now a TOTAL bear market? \nPossibly layoffs? Short sales, foreclosures. Doom and gloom yada yada.*\n\nTLDR: foreign investors have the weakest hands. Vancouver’s entire real estate market is 33% owned by Chinese nationals. Its market is already down 15% this past quarter. \n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit: Also, investors have had access to money by putting their previous properties as collateral.

If we get just a few % of the worlds population to chime in for a summer in which we don't overspend, don't accept increasing prices - we might have a chance to kill inflation at its core. And as a free add-on teach the greedy corporates a lesson in macro economics.\n\nLet's team up and let the below message go viral - fire on all social media cylinders.\n\n*\"*\n\n*Sign up now to* ***kill-inflation summer 2022!***\n\n*Inflation needs two to play: greedy corporates and* ***consumers to accept higher prices****.*\n\n*Join the viral experiment of the century and* ***reverse the trend****. Spread the word and* ***follow below inflation-killers between 1st July to 30th September****:*\n\n1. *Postpone any spending that is not absolutely necessary right today.*\n2. *Food, drinks: Spend the minimum you can, only buy the necessary, less premium products, less meat, less brand, more local stuff, don’t stock up. Buy at the lowest price chains.*\n3. *Rent, property, large investments, cars: offer 15% below ask - walk away if you don‘t get 10% below ask; don‘t flip if you don‘t have to.*\n4. *Purchases few $100s to 1’000s: negotiate prices, walk away if they don‘t concurr.*\n5. *Online shopping: stop for 2 months unless absolutely necessary. You have already most you need.*\n6. *Leisure: spend less, do more at home or outside, avoid commerce, cancel subscriptions.*\n7. *Transport: it‘s all about using less fuel, i.e. use car pool, bus, train, e-bike, walk instead of own car and airplane.*\n8. *Holidays: no airplane, stay local, couch surf, camping, hostel, local B&B instead of hotel or AirBnB; call and negotiate rates down.*\n9. *Food in restaurants: do it less, chose the ones with less inflated prices, let them know you reduce tips or order less by the amount they increased the price.*\n10. *Utilities: increase AC by a few degrees; decrease heating by a few degrees; shower shorter, colder.*\n\n*Share this message on all channels – if just a few % of the population act on this, this will make a real impact.* ***It will get you personally more money in the bank – and in the best case make a dent in inflation!***\n\n*Why should it work? Best example is energy: during Covid oil demand crashed by 30%, prices went below 0. If we get the world to rduce oil demand by 5% we can achieve a significant balance towards over supply - that will bring prices down. Other examples: air travel: if planes won‘t get filled they will reduce prices. If rent ask prices are not met they will accept lower bids.*\n\n*And remember: the only ones really with an interest to stop inflation is you, the consumer (mid- and lower class). Anyone else is happy with inflation, in particular the rich, corporates, politics, and governments.*\n\n*This will work if we can make it a global, viral movement. So distribute and fire on all cylinders - reddit, facebook, twitter, Insta, tiktok, LinkedIn, 9gag, etc.*\n\n*\"*\n\nposition: big pile of cash, betting on inflation to end.", "id": "vav1nk", "created_utc": 1655066722.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vav1nk)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vav1nk)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Get people to not buy things.
