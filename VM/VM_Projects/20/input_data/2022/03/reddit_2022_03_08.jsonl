While the S&P500 has tripled over the past 15 years, VGK, Vanguard's European stock index, has declined by 30%.\n\nMany investors now are seeing these recent numbers, and no one wants to invest in Europe, as its seen as low growth. This has lead to the P/E and P/B ratios of VGK being approximately half of the S&P500, and a dividend yield nearly 3 times the S&P500.\n\nIn more recent terms, VGK is down 18.68% YTD, while the SP500 is down only 12.96%.\n\nYou may ask, \"but why would European stocks outperform the US now when they haven't the past 15 years?\"\n\nThere are a number of factors that would suggest this:\n\n1. Most European countries such as Germany have lower Debt to GDP ratios as a result of running budget surpluses the past decade, whereas the US has been stimulating its economy with excessive deficit spending. As interest rates rise, the US will have less ability to prop up its economy with deficit spending, and will need to make some difficult decisions about government spending and taxes.\n\n2. Inflation in the US is currently much higher than Eurozone, at 7.5% vs 5.1%. This means the US will need to be more aggressive at raising rates, which is contractionary.\n\n3. It is increasingly looking like the US will ban Russian oil imports, whereas most of Europe will not. \n\nAll of these factors above establish an environment that sets the us up for Stagflation not much unlike the 70's oil crisis, where oil embargoes lead to rising oil prices, until the prices were eventually fixed, at which point shortages occured. During this time, international stocks substantially outperformed the US.\nIn addition:\n\n4. The highest growth US companies that carried the market over the past decade are beginning to experience barriers to their growth. For example, Tesla being excluded from EV credits due to being non-union, increased government crackdowns and regulation on tech companies worldwide that threatens their revenue streams and margins, etc.\n\n5. The rise of remote work will make the economy more globalized. It is becoming easier to hire in Europe where salaries are lower and unemployment is higher than compete for scarce talent in the US. \n\nInvestment professionals have generally suggested keeping at least 20% of your stocks in international stocks, with a common target being 40%.

Then not only should I jump in but everyone should too.\n\nThe stock is down 50% from February, even more so from January.

Jump in hot boys because this cannot go tits up.\n\nTo further compound my evidence the alexa rank has declined maybe a couple hundred points on the ranking for Bumble, BUT Badoo their subsidiary has simply exploded over the past 90 days.

Other countries may have their regional equivalent, but the spaghetti rule is universal and transcends cultural and social boundaries ceteris paribus i.e. Dolmio is illegal or some shit.*\n\n# HOW I FIGURED IT OUT\n\nFirst you have to go through the history of pasta, and for that we have to start at the granddaddy of mass produced durum wheat foodstuffs: **Macaroni and Cheese.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[9 minutes sounds like a diabolical cooking time nowadays. Just eat a pepperoni stick and you're good to go, whats wrong with you?](https://preview.redd.it/a59ku5w657m81.jpg?width=269&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0929d03a82531632b1418452b334637bac1972fd)\n\n Copy pasting this small snippet from Wikipedia the best source:  \n\n*Pasta and cheese casseroles were recorded in the 14th century in the Italian cookbook,* [*Liber de Coquina*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liber_de_Coquina)*, which featured a dish of Parmesan and pasta.  A cheese and pasta casserole known as makerouns was recorded in the 14th-century medieval English cookbook, the* [*Forme of Cury*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forme_of_Cury)*.*[*\\[6\\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroni_and_cheese#cite_note-6) *It was made with fresh, hand-cut pasta which was sandwiched between a mixture of melted butter and cheese.* \n\nYou see, the Italians made some good shit. The pregenitor to the Mac 'N Cheese as we know it, this casserole thing was fucking **LIT,** it was easy to make that after a bit of fashioning you cram into the oven and you get a pretty good fucking meal. \n\nTwo factors: \n\n* It was easy\n* It tasted fucking amazing\n\nBut the wider public couldn't really access it yet as it needed a recipe and back then because nobody knew about it and  the average IQ level of the lower class was plateaued at about 30, roughly the IQ of this sub. Got it?\n\nOkay, now move onto the cut-off point between the Renaissance and the Industrial era. **The colonisation of America had begun.**\n\nThomas Jefferson tastes this good shit in Paris and it hits harder than a whip from a packed 2 metre long bong; he wants more, he wants to cattle drive the growth of civilisation and the American Dream off the back of Mac 'N Cheese. And you know what? He fucking goes for it and you know what he does? He gets factories to mass produce that shit. 200 Mac's for every family, and by god they were gonna fucking love it like the rampant consumers they were because what the fuck else were the supposed to eat? But its not enough. Not enough flavour, not enough spice, it was a short meal with faltering food standards that couldn't sustain a growing good boy into adulthood...\n\n# ...THEN. THEN IT ARRIVES.\n\nAlberto Alvisi, the cook for Pope Pius VII produces a truly blessed creation. Jesus Of Nazereth predicted it, the clergy of all of Europe was entranced by it, Mohammed fought for it if only to grab a glimpse of the future his empire would enable thousands of years down the line. The Virgin Mary slept with it. The wife's boyfriend of meals that Joesph could only stand by and watch as the sun percolated through its radiant ruby glow. It was said that the Flying Spaghetti Monster was but one of its progeny.\n\n**Spaghetti Bolognese. It was here. The perfect dinner.** \n\n* It was quick, easy to make \n* It was accessible to anyone, even a PLTR HODL'er could cook it\n\nAnd most importantly.\n\n* **You could mass produce it.** \n\n**SNAP TO THE MODERN DAY**\n\nThe standard meal of Western society, the spaghetti bolognese. It's noodles have stretched across the globe, emergent through the  gridded collander. Ascending its humble position as a mere durum wheat and tomato mix, it now sustains billions across the globe across hundreds of countries. To disrupt the supply of spaghetti bolognese is to destabilise capitalist society and shake the cultural zeitgeist to its core. \n\nWhen Covid struck, all of Ireland had assembled at the local supermarkets as fears of lockdown coaelsced. We all knew what we were grabbing. \n\nI was innocent then, still had a fulfilling education and prospects ready for the big wide world...but you wouldn't get it man...you weren't there...the aisles...\n\n*...oh the aisles...*\n\n[artistic rendition of me at Supervalu \\(I'm built like a tank because I respect people's pronouns\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ls9gk6o9c7m81.jpg?width=262&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=741ebb2b813b56d707532cca18bfd4e79aedbbe3)\n\n...it was gone, the milk had been ransacked and even the rice had nearly disappeared. But even that could not prepare for the sight of the bolognese aisle.\n\n A dozen people with a forlorn gaze, as nothing remained of the sauces or the necessary components to put the essential holy meal together. Everyone reacted differently; some glanced at the aisle and gave up hope on the spot, settling for the desperate penne lisce. Others struggled, scrambling through the gaps in the back to see if any had fallen down. I saw one person steal the pasta from another when they weren't looking. It was nearly as bad as the toilet paper. It was like the moral soul of society had been sucked by a sucky pasta sorcerer\n\nI never forgot the sight, the look on those poor parents' faces. What were they gonna tell the kids?...It was gone. Our country would never be the same again, and democracy was thrown into jeopardy. It is my honest belief the only reason people protest lockdown is because they nostalgia for the time they could eat spaghetti bolognese and be left alone in bliss.\n\nThe stock market promptly went into wumbo mode when Covid *really* kicked in but two days later.\n\n# HOW IS THIS USEFUL?\n\nRECONNAISSANCE. Testing the waters to see if people are about to break.\n\nYou see that shit missing from a shelf, whip out your phone and BAIL from whatever the fuck your invested. The market crash to come will be a wet smack worse than being forcefed a felch session from Michael D. Higgins, you are not prepared no matter how well you think you are prepared. Even if its implicit, even if its only a few missing packs, wait at least three hours for that shelf to be restocked and if it is not so during that time then it has already begun and you're on damage mitigation duty from here on out.\n\nEven if a market crash is somehow averted, you're going to witness a bizarre instability that even Noah and his Ark couldn't sail upon that I guaran-fucking-tee you there will be no other technical analysis will have predicted. There is one no more reliable indicator of a market crash than spaghetti bolognese, that shit goes missing then so does Wall Street in an almost directly proportional relationship.\n\nRemember folks:\n\n# WATCH THE SPAGHETTI BOLOGNESE.", "id": "t9nem3", "created_utc": 1646764156.0, "score": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|13|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t9nem3)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t9nem3)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Epic", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Jokes on him\nI cant read", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Mama mia", "score": 14, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is what big bologna wants you to think", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "Going long spaghetti futures", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "can you show us on this bottle of bolognese where the nice man next door made you touch his wet noodle?\n\nNot even GPT-3 could have created this given the prompt “tell me your most retarded theory based on pasta and the stonk market.
