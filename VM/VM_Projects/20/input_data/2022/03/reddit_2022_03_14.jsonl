And this is after seeing all the graham stephan and other investing youtubers that make it imperative that you put your money in a well diversified portfolio telling you that slow and steady wins the race and don't put your eggs in one basket yada yada. This advice is the best you could give to a new investor but it doesn't matter what anyone says as soon as your friend doubled his money on a stupid memecoin or when you put 50 dollars on rblx and watched it go high. \n\nWith this people just kept investing and seeing their money climb then bam! your losing money because you put it in a stupid company that was only going up because everyone else was. In retrospect these are terrible investments that were basically guaranteed to go wrong. \n\nMy advice for those like me who haven't been completely dominated with no lube but have gotten a good slap on the face is invest in mcdonalds and spy or whatever you dingus anything else and your a goner. like me from now on live your wildest degenerative dreams by setting aside a small percentage of your portfolio and put it on a doomed stock that will fail like I am with SPCE.", "id": "tdkafc", "created_utc": 1647216380.0, "score": 47, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|9 months ago\n**Total Comments**|8|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=tdkafc)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=tdkafc)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Read until i saw down only 1,000, those are some rookie numbers", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Don't worry My next paychecks might put me in the big boy leagues of losing money", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Squeeze these nuts you fuckin nerd.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "Stocks sway on Wall Street as oil slides to $100 per barrel", "selftext": " Stocks are losing ground down on Wall Street in choppy trading Monday afternoon and bond yields are rising sharply as anxiety over the war in Ukraine and an upcoming [Federal Reserve meeting](https://apnews.com/article/business-jerome-powell-alan-blinder-economy-inflation-7dfbb4006575d0cc9920bbc1103154d1) on interest rates keep global financial markets on edge.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down 0.8% after having been up 1% earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 77 points, or 0.3%, at 32,864, as of 2:01 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite fell 1.9%. The pullback came as the yield on the 10-year Treasury touched its highest level since the summer of 2019.\n\nElsewhere around the world, markets pulled in opposing directions. European markets climbed, while stocks fell sharply in Hong Kong after the neighboring city of Shenzhen was ordered into a shutdown to combat China’s worst COVID-19 outbreak in two years. Oil prices tumbled to take some pressure off the high inflation sweeping the world, with a barrel of U.S. crude falling toward $100 after touching $130 last week.\n\nMarkets have careened in recent weeks amid uncertainty about whether the economy may be heading for a toxic combination of stagnating growth and persistently high inflation. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has caused prices to surge for oil, wheat and other commodities produced in the region. That in turn has led to sharp day-to-day and hour-to-hour reversals across markets, as expectations for worsening inflation rise and fall.\n\nOn Monday, negotiators from Russia and Ukraine met over video conference for a new round of talks, after the two sides expressed some optimism in the past few days. The talks ended without a breakthrough after several hours. The negotiators took “a technical pause,” Ukrainian presidential aide Mykhailo Podolyak said, and planned to meet again Tuesday.\n\nInvestors were already uneasy before the war began because central banks around the world are preparing to shut off the stimulus they pumped into the global economy after the pandemic struck. The Federal Reserve’s policymaking committee is meeting this week, for example.\n\n“You’re seeing pretty muted trading today and people aren’t going to get too short or long ahead of the Fed,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO of Infrastructure Capital Advisors. “We expect the market to stay pretty range-bound until the Fed meeting on Wednesday.”\n\n The wide expectation is that it will raise its key short-term interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point on Wednesday. It would be the first increase since 2018, and it would pull the federal funds rate off its record low of nearly zero.\n\n“Finally, the Fed gets moving,” economists at BofA Global Research wrote in a report. Besides raising short-term rates, the Fed may also give more details about how it will put into reverse the massive bond-buying program it ran during the pandemic to keep long-term rates low, the economists wrote. The central bank bought trillions of dollars of bonds to shower the economy with cash.\n\nThe Fed’s moves this week are likely to be the first in a long march to raise interest rates and slow the economy enough to stamp out the highest inflation to hit the United States in 40 years.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury jumped to 2.12% from 2.00% late Friday after earlier touching its highest level since July 2019. The two-year yield, which moves more on expectations for Fed policy changes, rose to 1.82% from 1.75%.\n\nThe Fed faces twin dangers, though. If it raises rates too quickly or too high, it would cause a recession. If it’s too passive, high inflation could become more permanent.\n\nThe war in Ukraine makes the balancing act even more difficult. It’s pushing inflation higher by raising prices for everything from nickel to natural gas. And it’s threatening to pull down on economic growth. That’s why the S&P 500 is coming off its fourth weekly loss in the last five, while crude oil prices are up by roughly a third for 2022 so far.\n\nOil prices gave back a lot of those gains on Monday, though, as coronavirus worries came back to the fore. A barrel of U.S. oil slid 6.7% to $102. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 5.1% to $106.97.\n\nSpreading virus outbreaks in China could hit demand for energy and compound worries over supply chain disruptions both from the pandemic and from the war.\n\n“Crude oil is going to move in this pretty wide range until we get more clarity on Ukraine,” Hatfield said.\n\nA vital manufacturing and technology hub of 17.5 million people, Shenzhen is home to some of China’s most prominent companies, including telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Ltd., electric car brand BYD Auto, Ping An Insurance Co., and Tencent Holding, operator of the popular WeChat message service.\n\nFoxconn, the supplier to Apple and other electronics brands, said it had suspended factory lines in Shenzhen due to the shutdown. In a notice to Taiwan’s stock exchange, its listed company Hon Hai Precision Industry, the world’s largest contract manufacturing company, said it did not expect the suspension to have a major impact on its business.\n\nThe Hang Seng index in Hong Kong fell 5%, with the exchange’s tech index dropping 11%. Stocks in Shanghai lost 2.6%.\n\nMore than 60% of stocks in the S&P 500 were down, with technology companies weighing down the benchmark index the most.
