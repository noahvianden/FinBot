We now live in an era where most stocks no longer pay dividends.

But none of these stocks pay their shareholders dividends.  \n\nNow, commodity investors invest in companies that either produce, mine, or grow commodities that are needed to make food, energy, or those pesky tech microchips that are in such a shortage today.  And in a world with limited resources, with every government printing money into infinity, all the sudden tech growth no longer seems that original. And owning shares of $FCX, $HAL, or $MOS which all pay dividends and also mine, pump & produce limited resources into existence no longer seems like a crazy investment, \n\nThis is my thesis.
