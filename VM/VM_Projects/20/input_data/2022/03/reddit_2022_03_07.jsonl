However, a quick look at the DAX shows that the this isn’t just traders closing out long positions and taking profits. The fall in prices has occurred with volume rising to its highest since the March 2020 crash, indicating that bears are in full control. \n\nOn the other hand, $SPX managed to avoid a weekly close below 4300, maintaining the key support level coming from the latter half of 2021, signaling strong demand and investors potentially looking to add to their positions around the current levels. S&P500 futures currently point to a lower open today, and the index is likely to continue testing this support over the week. However, if geopolitical developments within the coming days show an increased likelihood of the conflict being contained to the region, it could really accelerate the US market’s outperformance against its European counterpart. \n\nOf course, all trading carries risk, but it should be interesting to see how this plays out through the week.", "id": "t8jujd", "created_utc": 1646638406.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "I don't know how Adidas is going to make up all those track suit sales.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Ahahahaa", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "No, I don't think so.

Ore about it, but that my initial impression.\n\nSo, the Mustang Mach-E is definitely such a vehicle. The platform is a modified C2 (Ford Escape) platform. The powertrain comes from Magna. The packs are bog-standard LG NCM. And frankly, I think it was dumb as hell for them to build at Cuautitlán. It's clear they *wanted to get something out*, and it's amazing the Mach-E competes as well as it does.\n\nThe Hummer is... something else — a harbinger for what is to come with Ultium. It's GM showboating. Nothing is off the shelf. Take note of the Ni90 NCMA packs, wBMS, and Ultifi + Android Automotive software package. Brand new platform (BT1), brand new packs, brand new bespoke powertrain.\n\nI don't like the H1T much *as a vehicle* myself, but GM *did not fuck around* with it. It is truly their moonshot, and basically them setting up to hit the market with the Silverado (which will be the same platform, same powertrain, and same packs) a year from now like a *freakin' sledgehammer.*\n\nThat's exactly the kind of thing Tesla needs to be aware of as they continue focusing on the TMY, because it's *very possible* they get blindsided by the time the Silverado rolls onto the scene.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It isn’t just about margins it’s about supply chain.

In such a situation, *you actually want to expend effort to maximize per-unit margins, not units produced,* because the latter strategy will quickly run into diminishing returns for effort expended. \n\nAnd the best way to push margins? Splitting into multiple verticals so that you can maximize demand for each vertical. Consider that Tesla could literally sell Cybertrucks for $150K a pop right now, something that they *will not be able to do* in 2023/2024 when the F-150, Sierra, and Silverado are out. \n\nAm I personally glad that Tesla is trying their best to put out more TMYs? Yeah. I'm *personally* of the opinion that the Cybertruck needs more time in the oven, and that it isn't ready as a product yet. I'm *personally* happier to see more TMYs out on the road. \n\nBut from a *business standpoint,* I think Tesla would be much better off taking every bit of resourcing they have pumping out MYLRs at Austin this year, and redirecting those resources into getting the Cybertruck out in limited quantities, sold at insane margins, in performance trims.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Also, that narrative severely discounts what a sea change the CT will represent once these things start rolling drums and parking in parking lots.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Rolling drums?", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I don't think it has much to do with cost or profitability.
