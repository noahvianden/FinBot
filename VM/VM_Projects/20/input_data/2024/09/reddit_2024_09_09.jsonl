{"title": "My Journey with Stock Trading: From Dreams of Wealth to a Nightmare of Loss", "selftext": "\nI remember it so clearly. It was 2018, and many of my friends started talking about the huge profits they were making on the stock market. It felt like everyone around me had suddenly become experts in stocks and funds, and I didn’t want to be left out. I wanted to feel that same thrill – to see my money grow effortlessly. So, I took the plunge and started investing in some mutual funds. It felt like a safe first step.\n\nBut almost immediately after I invested, the funds started to drop in value. I remember the panic building inside me, the fear that I had made a huge mistake. But I held on, convinced that it was just a temporary dip. And sure enough, after a while, things turned around. The funds went back up, and I felt relieved. I thought I had learned an important lesson – that it was all about patience.\n\nThen, the talk shifted to individual stocks. And not just any stocks, but ones that everyone seemed to be buzzing about. Feeling confident after my experience with the funds, I decided to buy in. But I bought at the top, and almost immediately, the stock plummeted. I lost around $3,500. It was like a punch to the gut. I had no idea what to do, but I figured it was just bad luck.\n\nSo, I took a chance on another stock, determined to recover my losses. This time, it paid off, and I made a profit of $20,000. I started to feel unstoppable, like I had cracked the code of the market. But that feeling wouldn’t last long.\n\nThen came the 2020 crash. The stock I had made so much money on suddenly tanked, and I watched in horror as all my gains evaporated. In the end, I didn’t just lose my profits – I was down an additional $10,000. The fear and anxiety were overwhelming. I had built so much hope around my investments, and now it was all gone. In a panic, I sold everything at the lowest point, convinced the market was going to crash even further. It was like my whole world was falling apart.\n\nAfter that, I turned to trading. I thought that by trading stocks and indexes actively, I could quickly recover my losses. But instead, that chase became my downfall. Every time I lost money, I would immediately try to make it back by taking on bigger and riskier trades. I kept telling myself, \"Just one more trade, and I’ll get back to where I was.\" But every time, the losses piled up. I remember sleepless nights, the constant worry that never left me. It was like being stuck in a vicious cycle that I couldn’t escape. What started as a $10,000 loss eventually ballooned into a $60,000 loss.\n\nI couldn’t believe I had lost so much. It felt like I had completely lost control of my life. I was devastated, ashamed, and felt like I had ruined my financial future. The worst part was that I couldn’t stop. I was trapped in a destructive spiral, constantly chasing my losses and making everything worse.\n\nFinally, I realized I had to stop. I had to accept that the money I lost was gone for good. That was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, but I knew I couldn’t keep going down this path. It became clear to me that stock trading wasn’t the solution – it was the problem.\n\nI genuinely hope others can learn from my mistakes. Stock trading isn’t a guaranteed road to wealth. It’s an unpredictable and risky world, where no strategy, no system, no indicator can guarantee success. You might think you’ve found an \"edge,\" but sooner or later, the unpredictable nature of the market catches up with you. It’s just like gambling – no matter how good things seem in the beginning, the risk of losing it all is always there.\n\nWhat makes it even harder is that there’s no real way to self-exclude from stock trading like you can with gambling. For gambling, there are systems in place where you can block yourself from participating, but with stock trading, nothing like that exists. And because stock trading is so socially accepted, it’s harder to recognize when you have a problem. It’s only when you’re deep in it, when the losses are too big and the anxiety too heavy, that you realize how far you’ve fallen.\n\nI truly hope my story helps someone out there. If you feel like you’re heading down the same path, stop and take a step back. It’s not worth it. Stock trading may seem like a quick way to make money, but in reality, it’s a highly risky path where you can lose everything – just like I did.\n\nI’m tired of hearing people claim they have an edge.

So not quite enough in that case to cover your call. But you have usually 2-3 working days to deposit more money. So if you are bullish on nvda over the next few days and expect it to go up more, your margin call will probably be covered by the share price increase.\n\nThe other option is that you just sell around 18-20 shares of nvda today if you want to meet the equity requirements. That will cover your margin call. \n\nFrankly I would probably do nothing at this stage.
