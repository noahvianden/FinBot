Journalists wait a few weeks, and when they see everyone is feeling confident, that's when rumors start popping out. These days are green compared to how red it always gets, starting roughly 1 month post ER. This has been going on for a long time. \n\nThere's a phenomenon about September. Everyone has theories, but no one knows why there are so many sell offs that begin right in the middle of the month. Open your account, go to Microsoft and you'll see a drop off on the 14th. Go back prior years and you'll see the same. Go look at Google etc. Google dropped on the 18th. I used September as a strategy last year, sold everything and bought back around the beginning of October. \n\nWhen it comes to Nvidia, the election isn't the scary part. It's whether or not rumors are going to be spread claiming that the president is restricting \"all AI hardware\" from being shipped to China. When people start panicking over that and selling off, so will institutions and whales.\n\nI think the journalists will have a field day with the fact that we aren't going to see Blackwell in the next earnings report.

{"title": "Some Historical Data Analysis on the S&P 500", "selftext": "I'm just sharing some shit I calculated about the S&P 500, which I'll just call the SP 500.\n\nWhen you look at the yearly returns on the index since 1928 everything seems pretty normal. You can find 20+ percent returns on the SP 500, even really early (e.g. 1933, 1943, 1958, 1980 etc.) When calculating the moving average of these returns I got 7.97%. When looking at averages from a date to today we find these values:\n\n|1928|7.97%|\n|:-|:-|\n|1950|9.41%|\n|1980|10.48%|\n|2000|7.13%|\n|2009|12.99%|\n|2020|13.27%|\n\nIt seems as if the average yearly return is growing. The outlier of 2000-2024 is caused by the massive dot com losses without the bubble's growth.\n\nBut I wanted to get the growth in real terms. Side note here if we look at this in a physics perspective, we can look at the SP 500 as a position of something, say a point. Every year it moves, this can be up or down and measured as points or percentage. This growth can be seen as velocity (change in position per time period). The table above is the average velocity of the SP 500.\n\nBut the yearly change of the SP 500 is not constant. There will be stretches of good years and bad gay bear years. The change of growth could be called acceleration as in physics that is the name for change of velocity. That is what the above table somewhat shows. There has been change in the the growth SP500. In the linked excel document (will be in bottom in TLDR) I calculated the change of a moving average from one year to the next. And I found the moving average of that; which is constantly decreasing since the more data added to the moving average the less each data point affects it. But we can see general ideas.\n\nThe average return of the SP500 grows by 8 basis points (0.08%) every year. At this point I'm kinda confused by WTF I'm doing or even calculating. I calculated some more shit but I'm not sure what it means or even is.\n\nBut from what I can see, the index has been growing fast every year. So while some people who say that the SP is growing too fast just because they looked at the normal chart that is just because of how exponential growth works. But there is data to suggest the growth rate is increasing in the SP 500.\n\nGoogle Drive Link to xlsx file: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aY28Z5syAMYXnq1K\\_qP3CRZVify2zKQs/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113853431990622128066&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aY28Z5syAMYXnq1K_qP3CRZVify2zKQs/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113853431990622128066&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n\nTLDR: The S&P 500 is growing faster and faster every year.
