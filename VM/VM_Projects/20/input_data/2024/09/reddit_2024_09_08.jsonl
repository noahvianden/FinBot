A financial win for a Biotech company may barely move the financial needle for a Big Pharma company that's worth multiples of billions, depending on the amount of sales of the drug. If a biotech's drug is not the only drug on the market for a given illness, the money made from that drug's market share will be limited, since the Total Addressable Market will be shared with the competing drugs. There are also drugs that most of the public who need them will never see, due to the unfortunate fact that those drugs are too expensive to be mass-produced for the wider market.\n\n3) A company's revenue is very different from its stock price action. Even when a drug is sold to the public, it isn't guaranteed to translate to significant stock price increase.

Examples:\n\n* Mr. Musk stated in April 2022 that he was done selling Tesla stock, and then proceeded to dump Billions more onto the open market through December of that year.  See timeline here: [https://www.investopedia.com/musk-halt-selling-2022-7069052](https://www.investopedia.com/musk-halt-selling-2022-7069052)\n* Mr. Musk called the Reuters article on the cancelled NV91 project (manually driven NGV) false, but my review of Tesla's reports and SEC filings show that the Reuters report is actually true.  The manually driven NGV, originally based on the Gen3 platform, was abruptly scrapped and replaced by a Gen2.5 product, which uses elements of the current Model 3/Y and some upgrades from the Gen3 platform.  \n* Mr. Musk has repeatedly spread lies about people, including Paul Pelosi, Ben Brody (22 year old college student [wrongly accused of participating in a riot](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/10/06/ben-brody-elon-musk-lawsuit/71079585007/)), and Yoel Roth (former Twitter executive that Musk [wrongly accused](https://www.yahoo.com/news/elon-musk-tried-intimidate-silence-213651421.html) of promoting pedophilia in an academic paper)", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "So when Musk said he done done selling, was that supposed to mean forever? I, and most people, assumed it meant in that time period.\n\nThe Reuters article said they were scrapping a cheaper car in favor of the Robotaxi. They were cancelling NV91 and moving to a Gen 2.5. The headline of them no longer making a manually driven cheaper car was false even though yes they cancelled NV91.\n\nMusk can be annoying when he denies things explicitly even though there's a grain of truth to it but none of these examples are of him straight up lying about his businesses.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": ">So when Musk said he done done selling, was that supposed to mean forever?

Obviously that was a lie, given that Musk continued to dump Billions in stock even after the transaction had closed.  His actions speak for themselves.\n\n \n\n>The headline of them no longer making a manually driven cheaper car was false even though yes they cancelled NV91.\n\nHere's the problem I have:\n\nTesla specifically promised investors at Investor Day 2023 that they would develop and ship a next-generation platform vehicle.\n\n* Slide 47 of the presentation specifies 40% reduction in production line footprint and 50% reduction in costs.\n   * This is the product that Reuters was discussing: [https://archive.is/AjP92](https://archive.is/AjP92) - \"Tesla has canceled the long-promised inexpensive car **that investors have been counting on**\"\n\n  \nGen2.5 is realistically unlikely to achieve those same cost savings.  Tesla even says this in its filings: [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017024046895/tsla-ex99\\_1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017024046895/tsla-ex99_1.htm)\n\nPage 10 of the slide deck says;\n\n*\"This update may result in achieving less cost reduction than previously expected but enables us to prudently grow our vehicle volumes in a more capex efficient manner during uncertain times. This would help us fully utilize our current expected maximum capacity of close to three million vehicles, enabling more than 50% growth over 2023 production before investing in new manufacturing lines.* \n\n*Our purpose-built robotaxi product will continue to pursue a revolutionary ‚Äúunboxed‚Äù manufacturing strategy.\"*\n\n  \nPeople can dance around this all they want, but the **fact** of the matter is that Tesla promised investors something in 2023, that they then canceled.  Musk pulled a \"bait and switch\" here: killing NV91 and then lying about the Reuters article being false on the grounds that Tesla would build a Gen2.5 car on the 3/Y platform (which was NOT what was promised at Investor Day 2023). \n\n  \nI've been a TSLA shareholder since 2011.
