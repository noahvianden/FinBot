A financial win for a Biotech company may barely move the financial needle for a Big Pharma company that's worth multiples of billions, depending on the amount of sales of the drug. If a biotech's drug is not the only drug on the market for a given illness, the money made from that drug's market share will be limited, since the Total Addressable Market will be shared with the competing drugs. There are also drugs that most of the public who need them will never see, due to the unfortunate fact that those drugs are too expensive to be mass-produced for the wider market.\n\n3) A company's revenue is very different from its stock price action.
