I will send a PSA Notice if the Final PVI numbers are way outside these ranges AND THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THESE RANGES WILL HOLD NEXT WEEK!!  \nI cannot explain \"Scattershot\" or provide further details about the Model Calculations.\n\n**Step #1:**\n\n[SPX Model Range Profile 4\\/5](https://preview.redd.it/7i35iy0mjlrc1.png?width=565&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5383fbfb63fa2f0064006dda913ce9a8a98e5b5)\n\n**Step 2:** The 2nd Algo Run (column headers are just for my compartmentalization- not important)\n\n[Auto Models](https://preview.redd.it/mthdhcc0mlrc1.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fafc1f2b8e0dc82da2ccf465ffc8eb2c3694e07)\n\n**Step 3:** SPX / VIX Scatterplot Diagrams (less PVI)  \n- I have not completed the clustering, multi-regressions, or optimized the slope gradients  \n- These are where SPX & VIX intersect next week along 26 different data points  \n- Blue dots are labeled PWG (for my brain) and Orange are labeled PVI (final Algo run w/ Volatility)  \n- PVI is the last step to complete this table\n\n[SCATTERSHOT 4\\/5](https://preview.redd.it/r85ya8q6mlrc1.png?width=550&format=png&auto=webp&s=737c10d157cf6b67542b30a587e388008301be02)\n\n**Step 4:**  PVI Spreadsheet Template\n\n[PVI Spreadsheet 4\\/5](https://preview.redd.it/w8mvbtj0nlrc1.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=84f8154cc8bec7611548cd6874e63d2fd715f718)\n\n**Step 5:**  Final Adjustments (all manual)\n\nThe entire process takes me about 6-8 hours each weekend and encompasses volumes of data, models, and looking at things from a Quant perspective.

Email can be used to search a lot of data leaks to get almost all user info like name and address in some cases (for example if the same email is used for reddit account and insurance claim contact information which leaks the same day the claim is filed).

I say this because they understand complex concepts: Greeks, statistics, financial modelings, all these in various systems that manage their money. \n\nTherefore it’s likely that these users have good online security habits, more so than your average user from the WSB, or investing subs. So I don’t think we are too prone to spear phishing, or social engineering attacks. \n\nThe concern of the data leak by Reddit. Well that’s totally uncontrollable by users in this sub or any of the other 800M registered users. When that happens, as it has happened to many of the companies that we use in our daily lives, well again our good security habits, password protection etc comes into play. \n\nIn conclusion, as long as common sense and basic online etiquette is practiced, I feel that the probability of being identified is very low.\n\nRelated reading:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/s/1KP9b9siaJ", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Apologies, these may be a noob questions, I'm just trying to learn. \nIs PVI the price volume index study?\nIs it a default study you're using like the one available on thinkorswim or are you manually calculating it? \nIs the strategy to sell spreads outside PVI on a weekly basis using the weekly calculated PVI?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "PVI is just an acronym from my Options-based HF... **PURE VALUE INDEX**  \nIt is selling Credit Spreads at/outside the PVI Ranges on a weekly basis and has been consistently profitable for myself.
