APP provides advertising solutions for apps and acts as a middleman between app developers and advertisers.

The question is, how long the build-out last? I predict a few years - at least, during which there will be exponential growth. Once the infrastructure is built out, the industry will revert to a classic upgrade cycle. So, get it while it's hot!\n\nAn easy analogy is NVDA's other business - graphics cards for gaming. It used to be that everyone had shitty integrated graphics that came with their PCs, even if those PCs costs thousands of $s. And then gaming really took off.\n\nSo, everyone started upgrading. OEMs started integrating lower end versions of GPUs into their PCs, and so on. \n\nHowever, eventually everyone that wanted one, had one. And once that occurs, the ramp up is gone. Now, it's a cyclical product. If you buy an NVDA 4000 series. Unless you are a hardcore gamer, have a ton of discretionary income, or there's a generational change in tech, you probably won't upgrade to the 5000 series. Rather, you might wait for the 6000 series, or maybe even the 7000 series. Because if you consider the cost/benefit of doing an upgrade each year, it doesn't really make sense.\n\nThis exact thing will happen to datacenters. Once they are built, only an imbecile will swap out 10s of Billions of $ of recently bought AI chips for the next incremental version of that card. It's more likely that the datacenter will be upgraded in phases - for example, swapping out 20% of the AI cards for newer cards every year. So, a 5-year cycle to replace the entire data center, and so on.\n\nI know I'm rambling, but another example is AAPL. 15 years ago, no one had an iPhone. And once it took off, they went from selling 50 million iPhone in 2010 to almost 250 million in 2023. Obviously that kind of exponential growth cannot continue. Otherwise by \\~2030, they would be selling 1.5 billion phones a year. This would literally mean almost every phone user on earth buys a new iPhone every single year. That's just silly. Today, almost everyone who wants one, has one.\n\nThat's why AAPLs sales have flattened (their profits are now coming primarily from services and other devices like airpods).The generational change with each iPhone no longer requires one to upgrade every year. People hold onto their phone for two years, three years, or sometimes even longer. Upgrading every year is no longer necessary unless you want TITANIUM! \n\nThis is why recently analysts have such a boner for the new Apple Intelligence. they believe it will be enough of a technological shift forward, that it will cause a massive upgrade cycle. They believe many people who have held onto their iPhone will finally have a reason to bite the bullet. So, instead of 10% of people upgrading their iPhone each year, in the upcoming one, maybe 30% of people will upgrade. That would be 400 million phones. I don't see it happening, but that is why AAPLs stock went from 180 to 240 in the blink of an eye. The stock's value has built in a huge potential sales bump.\n\nThe end.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit. It's Chad Dickens.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
