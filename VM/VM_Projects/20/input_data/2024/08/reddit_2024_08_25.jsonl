{"title": "How many of you \"chase\" a stock?", "selftext": "Been selling options for the past 4 years and still learning. Started with selling CCs on AMC (got lucky when I bought 300 shares AMC really cheap during Dec-2020) and it ended up as a 10x bagger for me over it's life time. I was selling weeklies for 4 months in 2021 (IV was insane and I was getting $500 average premiums per week) until meme stock frenzy died and AMC lost it's juice. Having tasted success accidentally on CCs, stupid me though it's the name of the game and acquired bags of other meme stocks in hopes of earning weekly income. I bought 100 shares of BB, CLOV, WISH, NOK, BBBY, GME, and some more meme stocks that I can find in Reddit (WSB). Well! Party is over very quickly and I am left holding these bags with 90% drop in price. Lesson #1: always bank on stocks that are reliable and have good fundamentals.\n\nI had a quiet time in 2022 when the markets went down. I felt itchy and desperate and sold a CC on my META stock with a 45 DTE close to the stock price. META had an insane run in Jan-2023 and it quickly went out of my grasp. I have been wheeling TSLA since then and it is a very good one for me so far. My cost basis is almost down by $100/share but I am no longer desperate. Because of the wild nature of the stock, I just hang in there without doing anything until it comes up. Just trying not to repeat the mistake I did with META. I did get assigned on TSLA a couple of times, but I basically sold CSPs and wheeled it.\n\nLesson #2: be patient and not to be overly desperate. Also, I sell CCs only 1 0r 2 weeks ahead and let the theta work on my favor. I stopped selling 45 DTE CCs.\n\nApart from selling CCs on the stocks I own, now a days I mostly sell CSPs. I pick puts about 45 DTE with and sell anywhere between 0.30 to 0.50 delta. I close the position once I get 50% return and repeat it. Due to this bull market run, I constantly find myself needing more money to sell a CSP because the underlying stock is growing. I have a bunch of examples over the past year  (AMZN, GOOG, CAVA, ARM). I funded my RH account with 50K and have been selling CSPs. CAVA for example went crazy, my first CSP was for $55 SP and now it is around $120. I just leave stocks like these after a while because I cannot keep pumping money and chase the stock. I realize that I cannot beat the market by selling options but I am in for the long haul and also want to generate passive income. I started withdrawing money that I earned from my premiums to cover taxes and also for extra cash. That weekend dinner with family in a nice restaurant, a small home improvement project etc are now being funded from my Options money and that brings smile to me :) \n\nLonger term though, I am thinking of splitting my account into 2 categories - one for long term investment on ETFs to help boost my retirement savings and another for just weekly Options trading. Because I see benefits in both approaches.\n\nI know I typed the subject of this post to ask a simple question but digressed and wrote a much lengthier one :) Coming to the actual question, what do you guys do when you sell puts and the underlying keeps rising?
