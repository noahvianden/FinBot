I was on the correct side of this because I had both a covered call and the stock.

I saw that market started to sell off right before open, that’s a pretty big sign to sell right?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Not always. The bond market is where I looked. I was looking for a 0.1250 to 0.250 drop in the US02Y at 530 am. look at the chart, you'll see it spiked. I watched it for the next hour, it tried to reverse but didn't. Same thing on the us10y. (US02Y is a symbol on tradingview)\n\nThen close to the open I checked cme's fed watch  on their website and looked at the Sept cut odds and how they changed with yesterday. That's when I made a determination that the market was pulling out the 50 bps cut and I decided to sell my position. IWM is a big benefactor of a rate cut. If the yields were actually moving up then flat was out of the question. I expected us to lose all of yesterday's gain.\n\nYesterday was likely positioning for the report. \n\nIt wasn't worth holding at that point. I honestly felt very lucky to have made it out with no loss. When it spiked I expected us to open red. I decided a few minutes before open that I would watch the 5 second ticks for about a minute at the open. The moment I saw a curve down I decided it was probably the best price I'd get all day", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Great call, from the fedwatch probabilities, basically the 475-500 bucket decreased. Logically, there is less chance for a steeper rate cut, so sell off yesterday’s positions.

They are holding more risk today than yesterday.\n\nLike NVDA. Probably because they are convinced by earnings. That's the benefit you can have sometimes of being in an individual name.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "That's my interpretation. It could still get priced back in, but I am less bullish on the upcoming data. I thought CPI would come in light because of PPI. But rents increased, which is why we're so mixed. They are going to look for some other signal. Maybe it's retail sales tomorrow.\n\nI am just bearish on that. Companies have been talking about a more reluctant consumer.\n\nIf a bucket moves from 55 to say 80-90 we get a big move in the market. Because they \"price it in\". I generally consider >80% priced in.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Should also mention, since you mentioned learning, US02Y is a proxy for the fed funds rate. The federal reserve is generally able to control the \"short end\" of the curve. Meaning 2 year rates and less. Us10y is linked to the US economy. That's why during the panic last week you saw yields drop on the long end. It was a flight to safety.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}
