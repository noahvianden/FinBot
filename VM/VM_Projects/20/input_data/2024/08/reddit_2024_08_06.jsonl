I'm kind of speaking to the void here, but I'll welcome everything from uplifting words of encouragement to shaming me for my degeneracy. I've made some silly plays, and I'm just looking for some outside opinions. I have the following positions. \n\nNVDA 125C 8/30/24  \nNVDA 113C 8/30/24  \nNVDA 108C 8/09/24  \nNVDA 101C 9/16/24\n\nI've all but come to terms with the 108C getting obliterated and at this point I'm just hoping we see a little rebound this week and maybe I can avoid losing my entire ass on that one. \n\nI'm cautiously optimistic about my other positions. While the market has been bleeding hard (seemingly ever since I entered options positions starting about a month ago...) I have hopes that NVDA earnings and possibly even people buying up the stock before earnings will bring me closer to equilibrium in these positions. \n\nI feel like at this point short of more bad news coming out specific to NVDA (which could of course happen) we've priced in the bad economic data, the shipping issues, the anti-trust, etc. If they present strong numbers and make a few saucy whispers that continue the hype during earnings, I feel we could easily get back to 130 territory if not higher. \n\nBut I am no fortune teller and I am not smart enough to read beyond the tea leaves. That's probably why I should have never gambled with these options in the first place, but I almost feel like this is the universe testing me. I've let my emotions get the better of me on other trades and left well before I made what I should have on other options plays. I could cut ties with my current positions and be out about 5k on about 9k cost basis (something around there). But that's what my intuition is telling me. I think I need to inverse myself to finally get some green numbers going. \n\nI'm not here for sympathy, but I genuinely respect a lot of the feedback I see regular posters receive on this sub, and was curious what my corny ass would get with may pittance of a portfolio here.

Since their true fair value is *indeterminate*, yet we know its **overvalued**, it causes a long term market crash while the market *tries to figure out the actual values.* So it goes crashes for a long time, making a volatile bear market.

An option does. If your grandmother gives you $700K and you buy Intel, and the next day it goes down 20%, you can resign yourself to sitting on that stock for a decade hoping it will recover.

{"title": "Yesterday's brokerage issues", "selftext": "TLDR: Schwab hates you; RH, WeBull and TastyTrade kinda think you're an okay bloke\n\n\n\n\n**Outages**\n\nSchwab had the worst outage, with what looks like a system overload from the volume of people trying to log in. The outage lasted up to 3 hours for some. It was about 2 hours for me.\n \nIf you had puts in your Schwab account, I am truly  sorry. You probably left some heavy gains on the table.\n \nFidelity, IBKR, and Vanguard (and probaby others) were all down for the open for quite a few, but none as bad as Schwab. But it was only an open with the 3rd highest VIX in history, so what's the most important 30 mins between friends, am I right?\n\nWhat matters is you're trading with a \"real\" brokerage. \n\n\n\n\n**The Overnight Session**\n\nOvernight trading venue Blue Ocean fucked up hard last night. They stopped the trading session early, at 1 am. Worse, they canceled executed trades. As both Robinhood and IBKR use Blue Ocean, both got fucked and fucked hard. Canceled trades took like 8 hours to clear up.\n\nThey have also canceled tonight's session (Aug 5).\n\n\n\n\n**That's it, I'm done with [insert your broker]**\n\nWell, you can judge for yourself how each handled the 3rd highest VIX spike in modern history. I was already getting fed up with Schwab, myself, so I'm for sure done with them and their shitty tech. \n\nAs for where to go, RH, WeBull and TastyTrade apparently all had zero issues with the open. The overnight session problems were a Blue Ocean problem and so if you decide on a \"real\" broker like IBKR, that ain't gonna fix the overnight issue. (Overnight is new enough and low volume enough, that I'm a *little* more forgiving, and it's not like there are other options for retail.)\n\n\n\n\n**Tinfoil Hats**\n\n*This was planned to stop retail from buying the dip!!!1!!1!*\n\nI doubt it. Looks like most of the so-called \"real\" brokers have subpar infrastructure that can't handle massive volume. They just got swamped and Schwab showed itself to be the worst at handling the volume. \n\n\n\n\n**They did you a FAVOR**\n\nBullshit. Absolute, uncut bullshit. They are brokers, not our fucking parents, and (most of us) aren't 12. \n\nHad puts? Go fuck yourself. \n\nWanted to buy the dip? How about you eat a dick instead.\n\nWanted to liquidate one set of positions in order to rotate into 3x bull etfs? Sorry, bro, this is \"for your own good.\"\n\n\n\nConclusion: probably RH calls at open. (They are totally about to raise the Gold fee and this is going to give them some new customers. And they're about to have literally all my money)\n\nEdit: I've been told IBKR does, in fact, have a separate overnight venue, but I guess they sometimes route orders through Blue Ocean.
