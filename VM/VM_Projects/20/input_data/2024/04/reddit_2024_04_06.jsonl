{"title": "RH and BLK and coming earnings and why I shorted RH ?! What about BLK?", "selftext": "Let's see if I can summarize this here. I have been short on RH for some time now. Before making my conclusions, I examined the following data. First off, I want to say that my research led me to believe that the product's quality is not that great. I live in NYC, and RH has an outlet here in Industry City, which is in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Their prices are overextended, which I attribute to RH's thorough research. They know that the average household income of families residing in the surrounding areas exceeds $250k per year. I am pretty sure their outlets are in similar locations for the exact same reason: it's a simple profit/loss ratio, and RH knows that the higher profit margin will offset the higher average carrying expenses. So, why would I short the stock and bet against RH? My first reason was the low home sales. Interest rates have risen quite a bit; a 30-year fixed rate is above 7%, and most homebuyers would try to maximize their savings by purchasing furniture from one of RH's competitors. RH supposedly manufactures their furniture pieces in China. Full disclosure, I have no idea where exactly it is made, but a simple Google search will tell you that. Follow this link for more information: \\[link to furniture manufacturing details\\].\n\nHave consumers been complaining about the product or the quality of the product? You can read the reviews for yourself here: \\[link to consumer reviews\\].\n\nNow, my reasoning was that since home sales have been down, and the quality of the furniture is not pleasing to the average consumer, and in general, people are not furnishing their new houses, RH would likely miss their analysts' earnings call and underperform. Well, this is exactly what happened. The adjusted net revenue of $738 million missed the consensus mark of $777 million by 5% and fell by 4.4% on a year-over-year basis. The revenue decline was attributed to \"several weather\" events in January and shipping delays related to the ongoing conflict in the Red Sea. RH missed Q4 earnings and revenue estimates. RH reported quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share, missing the estimated earnings of $1.71 per share.\n\nLogically, one would expect that the price per share of the stock would drop accordingly to account for the revenue loss. However, we witnessed the opposite; the price per share went up by almost 18% after the earnings announcement.\n\nLet's not forget that the short interest before the earnings call was more than 51%.\n\nAccording to the data and common sense consensus, everyone should have expected that since RH did not meet expectations, the price per share would come down to adjust the value based on performance. This did not happen. On the contrary, the price went up, and shorts got squeezed.\n\nCould this be manipulation? No way, this is a fair commodity, a self-regulated market, and manipulations are not possible.\n\nNow, let's talk about the biggest institutional investors behind RH. It turns out that the largest shareholders include Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc.\n\nI am trying to find any correlation between the price movement of RH's stock and BLK's, but my indicators are not refined enough to discover the precise connection, and I would leave this to the readers.\n\nAnyway, why am I talking about RH and a potential connection with market movement and the price of BLK's stock? Well, BLK is set to announce earnings this coming Friday, April 12th.\n\nSo, some scenarios could possibly aid the retail investor's decision. How overstretched are the big funds, and could they go down because their investment assets have come down in price? Let's not forget LULU... What are your bets? Are you playing calls or puts on BLK?\n\nA $10 TRILLION ASSET UNDER MANAGEMENT COMPANY.
