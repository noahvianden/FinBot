{"title": "Not much value in crypto ETFs.", "selftext": "Crypto has made a huge step towards gaining legitimacy with the approval of crypto ETFs. And with billions of dollars flowing into crypto, is crypto here to stay or is it just another hype?\n\nCrypto believers have made many big claims. It would give freedom from the oppressive governments and help the little guy, but at the end of the day crypto is just another currency.\n\nValue comes from the benefit something brings to the people. For example, money makes our lives better because it helps us buy things, pay for services and it helps us get paid when we help others through our work. So the value of the currency is determined by the transactions it helps facilitate. So to ask what value does crypto have, is similar to asking what kind of transactions does it help facilitate that otherwise would not have happened?\n\nWhen the bubble happened in 2016, the story was that we would be able to buy coffee with Bitcoin in the future. Unfortunately if you were to buy coffee with Bitcoin, you will spend more on the transaction costs than you would on the coffee. As a result, crypto failed to gain mainstream usage. So it is primarily used for transactions where other forms of currencies canot be used. Crypto's best feature is that it can evade government regulations and instantaneously cross borders, so it is primarily used for illegal activities. Crypto enables money laundering, scams, drug trade, and many other much darker activities. Although crypto is very valuable tool for criminals, overall it is a net negative to society.\n\nSo is crypto here to stay or is it just a passing fad? As long as governments allow it to exist, crypto will continue to flourish as it is very useful to criminals. However, it is a very real possibility that the world's major governments will ban all crypto. China is major country that banned crypto because of the social unrest the crypto scams were causing. The value of crypto is built on unstable foundation. While crypto is thriving today, it's value could disappear overight. \nAlthough unlikely, what if a documentary about how crypto enables human trafficking goes viral? The public sentiment would surely turn negative, and the reactionary government could look into banning it. And everyone who invested into crypto will wake up to find their investment worthless.", "id": "1eani23", "created_utc": 1721780003.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.25, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 9 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 9 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Not gonna lie, this reads like it was written by a CCP bot training via chatgpt", "score": 51, "replies": []}, {"body": "You sound like you know next to nothing and are just trying to repeat some soundbytes to feel like the smart one for not getting involved.", "score": 19, "replies": []}, {"body": "This reads like a D- middle school report on crypto.", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "What the fuck is this?", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "No currency has \"value\".
