I will report back with my initial experiences once I get of the waitlist. \n\nTakeaways so far on what they are actually including based on the onboarding UI\n\n- Apple Intelligence is available in English only\n\n- Siri has heightened context and can carry on conversations similar to other LLMs like ChatGPT. Interested to see if it's any good, and what the latency is like. \n\n- The creative features seem to be there a bit, with the enhanced writing and some of the image generation stuff. \n\nEither way, I'm not sure how many people even have access to this since it's on a waitlist, but I imagine that initially a lot of the perceived success will depend on the Siri features, since it will take time for the software ecosystem and developers to start pushing app updates that leverage the new AI APIs.", "id": "1egukks", "created_utc": 1722450601.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "The waitlist took me about 2 minutes...", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Is this Warren Buffett‚Äôs burner account?", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Not much to note yet.

Yeah MSFT made good over the last few years, but they're still one of the giants, and giants just can't move very well. They may be able to compete but they're never going to be a market \"leader\" when it comes to new tech. Azure, sure. They beat Google and they're catching up to AMZN's market share in cloud. Time will only tell if AMZN will allow  MSFT to overtake them. \n\nBut the point is this. I KNOW which tech/semis I want to own, and which ones I don't. Folks need to learn at all levels that when the talking heads paint in broad strokes like this it's because they DON'T in fact understand the business, and they're probably basing their opinions off something that's almost patently worthless when it comes to the tech sector.
