{"title": "Ultimate Nvidia DD (The Best)", "selftext": "First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.\r  \n\r  \nIt seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.\r  \nNo, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.\r  \n\r  \nFirst, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?\r  \n\r  \nYou could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.\r  \nIt would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.\r  \n\r  \nAI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.\r  \n\r  \nHow did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?\r  \nBecause a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.\r  \nAn AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.\r  \n\r  \nThis General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).\r  \n\r  \nThis general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.\r  \n\r  \nThey gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.\r  \n\r  \nHow did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.\r  \n\r  \nWhy did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:\r  \n\r  \n\\- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees\r  \n\r  \n\\- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)\r  \n\r  \n\\- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)\r  \n\r  \n\\- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers\r  \n\r  \nThe Analogy:\r  \n\r  \n„Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).\r  \n\r  \nTSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.\r  \n\r  \nThe TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.\r  \n\r  \nAt the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.\r  \n\r  \nNvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.\r  \n\r  \nEveryone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.\r  \n\r  \nWhat is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.\r  \n\r  \nDoes this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“\r  \n\r  \n\\----\r  \n\r  \nNVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.\r  \n\r  \nSomeone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.\r  \n\r  \nNVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them.\r  \n\r  \nWhich company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC.\r  \nTSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.\r  \n\r  \nSo there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.\r  \n\r  \nThere are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.\r  \n\r  \nSo which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.\r  \nDo you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?\r  \nThis is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.\r  \n\r  \nBuilding a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.\r  \n\r  \nAMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.\r  \n\r  \nIntel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.\r  \n\r  \nAccording to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.\r  \n\r  \nNow, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!\r  \n\r  \nOk, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:\r  \n\r  \n„However, in 2010, Apple made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.\r  \n\r  \nSince then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ (Does Apple use Nvidia?

Price targets can pertain to all types of securities, from complex investment products to stocks and bonds.

Ultimately, price targets depend on the valuation of the company that's issuing the stock.  \n>  \n>Analysts generally publish their price targets in research reports on specific companies, along with their buy, sell, and hold recommendations for the company's stock.

{"title": "Case for JBL (Jabil)", "selftext": "With the insane hype around Supermicro Computers, I'd like to introduce Jabil Circuit ($JBL) as a noteworthy alternative. My expertise lies in Cloud Architecture and Datacenter Engineering, a field where I've been developing infrastructure for Fortune 500 companies for over ten years.\n\nPublic and private cloud providers rely heavily on server nodes to operate machine learning/deep learning models and AI, necessitating rapid scalability. As the demand for Datacenters escalates, leading providers such as Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Amazon Web Services (AWS) continue to expand, launching new regions to ensure redundancy and high availability. Within this environment five suppliers stand out: HPE, Dell, Supermicro, Intel, and Jabil.\n\nIt's important to note the distinction in offerings among these suppliers. While HPE and Dell are known for their comprehensive range of storage and networking solutions, Supermicro and Jabil specialize in assembling servers utilizing components from leading semiconductor manufacturers like Intel, Samsung, and NVIDIA. This specialization places a premium on efficiency and lead times, a critical factor where Jabil excels. Historically, Supermicro has struggled with extended lead times, which, as of 2022, exceeded four months for new server orders, a delay that persists but slightly improved today. In contrast, Jabil not only matches Supermicro's capabilities but also surpasses them in efficiency and cost-effectiveness. As an authorized partner for the Azure HCI stack, a credential it shares with Dell, HPE, and Supermicro - Jabil offers a insane value prop, being approximately 30% less expensive for all builds and boasting delivery times for servers that Supermicro could not fulfill, often within two months.\n\nJabil's strengths extend beyond its competitive pricing and swift turnaround times. The company has a super robust manufacturing network, with facilities strategically located worldwide, including Guadalajara MX, which facilitates expedited shipping to the United States. This global footprint is instrumental in Jabil's ability to dominate not only in the server market but also across various sectors, including chips, automotive, medical, optics and many more.\n\nTake a look at the Jabil Optics: [](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hodbxeli3ay)\n\nI am getting +100 $150 Jabil calls for 3/15 at MO tomorrow, they are due to report their earnings on 3/14 before market open.

My (very poor) understanding of this benefit that coinbase booked such a poor net income loss last year that they carried over as a benefit through a valuation allowance which was then partially released and allowed net income to go up. A corporation that loses a bunch of money one year, then makes a bunch of money the next doesn't have to pay income tax until its income exceeds its losses in prior years. And by looking there is still 1.2B of deferred tax assets on the Q42023 balance sheet.   \n\n\n**For 2023Q4:**\n\nSo with that said - the **273M of net income** with 264M diluted shares gets us to **$1.04 EPs** in the press. \n\nThat's $4.16 extrapolated linearly 4 quarters. At a current after market price of 190 - that's a p/e of 46. \n\nNow with the 2024Q1, let’s say 277M as noted above for net income without further valuation releases. That's $4.2 extrapolated linearly 5 quarters with a p/e future of 45. \n\nFor a stock price of $400 at the current forecast without valuation release - we would need 89 p/e which is extremely high but not un-heard of for emerging markets highly potential profitable businesses. See tesla/nvidia/smci for how the market can operate. I don't personally believe that an industry normal 32 p/e would be valid for Coinbase type of business.  Neither do I think 100 is reasonable.\n\n\nExample extremely bullish scenario:\n\nGiven the combination of anticipated bitcoin price increase in 2024/2025 due to halving in April (lets assume bitcoin reaches all time high again in 25% increase), increase over forecast in Q1 transactional and subscription service revenue (lets assume 5%), future deferred tax asset availability (lets assume 100M in Q1), and using forward looking p/e metrics in the 60 range.   \n\n\nPossible Q1/Q2 2024 forecast revenue with 25% bitcoin price increase and 5% beat. 1.25\\*1.05\\*1.15B = $1.5B. Expenses 1B. 500M operating income. 100M tax credit. 600M net income. 2.4B yearly net income. $9.09 eps. x60 = **$540 coinbase price**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow this information is all my opinion and is not financial advice. It is highly likely I made mistakes in math and in writing this. I'm just writing out why I believe coinbase has great potential to invest in.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: forgot to mention the $6billion of cash they have on hand which is equivalent to $22 of share price ", "id": "1arzjyf", "created_utc": 1708056811.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/gw8qi3fnkvic1.jpeg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8fb5eea558ad5aeff7947f5f7fc9dfd204cf331", "score": 36, "replies": []}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4640)", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "The only point you missed is they are getting a ton of Celcius transfers this quarter., some will stick some cash out!

{"title": "Ultimate Nvidia DD (The Best)", "selftext": "First things first: This deep dive isn't about Nvidia's next earnings call or the coming few months. We're zooming out here, looking at Nvidia from a mid to long-term investment lens.  \n \n\nIt seemed to me like common knowledge that Nvidia's future valuation is way overvalued, yet it turns out many are still in the dark.  \nNo, betting against Nvidia doesn't mean you're anti-AI. It means you're skeptical about Nvidia's monopolistic hype in the AI space.\n\nFirst, let's start with the obvious. How has the value of Nvidia, which previously generated half of its revenue from games, skyrocketed recently?\n\nYou could say it’s because of AI. But that can easily be misunderstood.  \nIt would be much better to say: It's because of ChatGPT.\n\nAI-focused development started a long, long time ago. Yes, AI is the future, but your neighbor doesn't believe you because he believes that only humans can solve certain tasks.\n\nHow did the general public attitude shift towards a complete AI-Hype?  \nBecause a new product came onto the market with many great Breakthroughs. But it’s not just any Product. It’s a Product that is easy to understand, easy to use by everybody and FOR everybody.  \nAn AI Product that Businesses AND Consumers can understand.\n\nThis General public attention has made OpenAI so important, it changed from OPENAI to CLOSEDAI and is now profit oriented (look up their background story).\n\nThis general public attention has caused every other company investing in AI to release their unfinished product to market. That's how we got Bard from Google. That's how we got these Donald Trump AI images because companies didn't even bother to invest time in developing better security filters. They had to release their product NOW.\n\nThey gave a shit about errors in their product or high costs. They had to be FIRST, or at least not late to the party.\n\nHow did Meta train LLama? With NVIDIA gpus. Same as Microsoft/Openai and everybody else.\n\nWhy did they Choose NVIDIA? I wrote an analogy about this in a comment (which I'm copying into this DD). But first, consider these important facts:\n\n\\- Nvidia is a fabless company. Their stock market value is not covered by material equivalents, their capital consists of the intellectual output of their employees\n\n\\- Nearly nobody can replace/compete with TSMC (Intel is trying to)\n\n\\- Every major company that has invested in NVIDIA has announced that they are working on their own custom chips (this will also improve performance since the chip is designed FOR their specific AI development)\n\n\\- Nvidia is currently winning with a product that they sell to other companies. It's not a product that they sell to retail customers\n\nThe Analogy:\n\n„Private customers want tables and other furniture made of wood. The companies that make this furniture need an axe to cut down trees (wood).\n\nTSMC can be described as the trees. Nvidia sells an axe that can be used to cut down trees.\n\nThe TSMC trees are a special kind of trees. They are more robust than other trees, but at the same time you have to be careful when you cut them down because they can break.\n\nAt the moment, everyone wants furniture made from these special trees because they are better than ordinary furniture, they look better and they are robust. You could say they are the future of furniture.\n\nNvidia currently sells an axe that was invented for similar trees, and that also seems to be the best axe on the market for the TSMC trees.\n\nEveryone is stocking up on equipment and buying Nvidia axes. But there are 2 problems: Nvidia axes are really good for cutting down these trees, but not perfect. Also, Nvidia axes are quite expensive because they currently dominate the market.\n\nWhat is happening now is that companies are developing their own axes to save money and optimize the tree cutting process.\n\nDoes this mean that Nvidia will no longer optimize its axes and lose all market share? No. Does this mean that Nvidia might be overvalued and not the only go-to company for these axes? Could this mean that they won't quadruple their profits every year? Yes.“  \n   \n \\----\n\nNVIDIA made a design available at a specific time frame where companies invested heavily in gpu chips to train AIs. The Design Nvidia delivered was the best performing at the market. But it is not the best design. Training LLMs would have been better with customized chips. But designing chips takes some time, at least 1-2 years. So what did companies like Microsoft/OpenAi, Meta and Google do? Train their LLMs on Nvidia Chips.\n\nSomeone said to me that NVIDIA is future proof because designing chips is not easy and that’s their moat. This tells me that the person doesn’t know the process behind chip production. We can even look at each company involved here and get a simple, clear picture.\n\nNVIDIA does NOT produce chips. They „only“ design them.\n\nWhich company produces NVIDIAs Chips? It’s TSMC.  \nTSMC by the way also produces Chips for AMD. And for Apple.\n\nSo there is one specific major company that produces chips for every big „Chip Design Company“. Why are they all using this single company that could (will) be attacked by China one day and disrupt their entire supply chain? Because THAT is the really difficult “moat” part with AI chips. This company is the only one truly relevant for AI growth. Anyone can design chips, but only one company can make them.\n\nThere are of course small exceptions. Some companies design AND produce their own chips. And we have to look at them. Not to invest in them, but to better understand why Nvidia doesn't have future moat.\n\nSo which famous company produces their own Chips? Intel.  \nDo you know why Intel lost so much market share to AMD?  \nThis is the reason. Because they produce their own chips. Not because of the design.\n\nBuilding a chip factory is a highly complex, highly expensive matter and takes years. Intel was slower than the competition. They were stuck with the old NM production processes and couldn't get their new systems up and running fast enough.\n\nAMD was winning market share because TSMC produces their Chips.\n\nIntel now changed their strategy. They now let their competitor, TSMC, produce their chips so they can stay in the market. In the meantime they’re building new chip factories and want to swap to their own production again.\n\nAccording to estimates, Intel will pay TSMC 14 billion US dollars over the next two years - for 3-nanometer chips.\n\nNow, you might argue that chip design is still difficult and believe that NVIDIA will be the future for all AI chip designs - despite every major AI Company literally saying they will design their own chips?!\n\nOk, here is an example where a famous company used primarily Nvidia chips but stopped doing so:\n\n„However, in 2010, **Apple** made a significant decision that would alter its GPU trajectory. The company began developing its own graphics technology, resulting in the creation of the Metal framework. Metal allowed developers to access the full power of Apple’s GPUs, optimizing performance and efficiency. This move signaled a shift away from Nvidia’s GPUs, as Apple sought to establish greater control over its hardware and software integration.\n\nSince then, Apple has predominantly relied on its in-house GPU solutions, including those integrated into its A-series chips found in iPhones and iPads. These custom-designed GPUs have showcased impressive performance and power efficiency, further solidifying Apple’s commitment to developing its own graphics technology.“ ([Does Apple use Nvidia?

TSMC is spending $100 Billion to build fabs (in Taiwan and Arizona) just to match current demand, let alone future expansion.\n\nLet me guess, Google/META are gonna build their own fabs? Sure, it takes billions and 5-10 years. And by the time you're done, you're 2 generations behind everyone else. Call up ASML and ask them to send you an EUV real quick.

The barriers to entry are astronomical.\n\nWith respect to Apple, they were just making a video rendering chip - something companies have been doing for ages. Something that is included on most motherboards for free. Apple has a completely closed ecosystem and that's why they wanted control of the video process.
