{"title": "FOMC Analysis & Trade Plan - $2K to $50K in 90 Days Challenge Day 10 - Total Net P&L: $8,022.72", "selftext": "**Challenge Update**\n\nSome of you may remember my original post about 2 weeks ago when I started this challenge. You can see it here if you'd like more context:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/19ddbe3/2k\\_to\\_50k\\_in\\_90\\_days\\_options\\_trading\\_challenge/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/19ddbe3/2k_to_50k_in_90_days_options_trading_challenge/)\n\nI originally planned on doing daily updates, but my day 2 post got removed due to the no journaling rule so I stopped posting here. For this update, I would like to provide some of my thoughts and Analysis on the Fed's rate cut decision, price action before and after FOMC, and the results. I had strong convictions about my trade plan and analysis, so I'd like to share it here so you can better understand how and why I trade that way. I think this could be useful for many people here. All I've been trying to do is educate new traders about the markets and teach them how to manage risk while also growing small accounts quickly. Everything I've provided has been completely free, I am not trying to take anyone's money or scam them. \n\nI'll post some thoughts I have about the criticism I have received and also some FAQs I have been answering. I'll start with the FOMC analysis and trade plan but will put this other stuff about the challenge near the bottom of the post. It's a decent read so I understand if you'd rather just look through the FOMC stuff.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Fed Rate Cut Decision Analysis**\n\nI had been seeing a lot of speculation about the Fed starting rate cuts in March leading up to the meeting and I was convinced there was a very high chance they were not going to announce cuts in March. Here are some comments I have shared about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI see a lot of people talk about how the fed has been victorious and planning rate cuts. Everyone I see who says this always says “fed is cutting rates, bullish for stocks”\n\nThis is generally true, markets do like lower interest rates. However, throughout history the market has usually sold off AFTER the fed starts cutting rates. It’s possible the US has not yet seen the full effects of the recent rise in inflation. And usually when the fed starts cutting rates, people tend to stop buying things that require loans in anticipation of getting a better rate after the fed starts cutting more which can lead to a recession.\n\nAll that to say, this time may be different because of the AI boom. I’m going to continue riding this trend as long as it lasts, but I don’t think it’s time for bulls to claim total victory.\n\nYou can speculate about jobs numbers or other data points, but I prefer not to. If you listen to Powell and follow FOMC minutes, you’ll know their plans. They don’t often change their minds easily. That’s why we got big reactions in 2022 because some of his comments were unexpected. That’s rare though.\n\nThe market is also pretty good at predicting these things and you can gauge sentiment using the fed funds futures rate. According to that the market is not expecting a cut in March anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FOMC Technical Analysis & Trade Plan**\n\nI have been extremely bullish since November and if you read the FAQs below you'll see that I do not like to fight the current market trend. Therefore, I was anticipating a bullish reaction after FOMC. I had some different scenarios, but mainly it was one bullish and one bearish if there were no cuts announced. I'll post these here. \n\nI was leaning towards bullish and thought it was likely we'd have lots of volatility that week. NQ was extremely weak on Tuesday the day before FOMC, so I thought there'd be a good chance that earnings for AMD and other tech names would end up causing a sell-off. So, I shared a comment about bears getting ahead of themselves if Wednesday ended up being a red day after FOMC.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wm8m77olehgc1.png?width=1564&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7a8ec0f45b7aeb5f278149c1534f19899f64d45\n\n**Bullish Scenario**\n\nFOMC minutes are released at 1 PM CST and there no planned rate cuts. This could cause a bad reaction initially. There will probably be some large price movements back and forth for the first 15 minutes or so. By 1:15, the market will decide where it wants to move before the press conference starts. The people on CNBC will say \"oh, the market doesn't like this. they wanted rate cuts\", a large sell off would ensue and ES would stop at one of it's support levels below. \n\nI think the 4888 and the 4874 levels will most likely be the spot where the sell off stalls out. It could also stop on the trend line below, but I think there'd be a bigger sell off than that. This is where things will get interesting and I'll look for a long if VX is not responding to the sell off and I see buyers step in.  At this point it will be close to 1:30 PM CST and Powell will take walk up the podium and deliver his remarks. There will be continued volatility during this time, but not quite so bad yet. Once Powell gets done talking and the market realizes he's not going to say anything that would scare bulls, it will start to rally back. Or, they will look for any tiny thing he says to justify a rally. No telling where this might stop. If it breaks above ATH it could just run up into close.\n\nThis is probably the scenario I think is most likely. Obviously, if VX gets out of control and the 4870 area broke on ES, a larger sell off could occur. We'll see if I'm right about this rate cut thing, I've been trying to tell people they aren't cutting rates in March, but many think I'm wrong. It's really not a big deal, I don't much care if I'm right or wrong. It's not like I'm going to wait until 12:59 CST and load up on calls and hope it works out. As long as you don't do that and are playing defense instead of offense you will be fine. Tomorrow is not the day to get aggressive. I'll be watching price action and will decide if I want to participate or not. You may see me buy puts or calls. No idea yet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3xir9jo4ehgc1.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=831893a7159dd684b8df7b7389ca0fe596dc284f\n\n**Bearish Scenario**\n\nNo rate cuts are announced and the market sees that as no big deal and starts heading up. ES can rally to 4957 and NQ could hit that trend line it fell below and sold off from today, or up to around the 17734 level. If both of these go up and hit these levels at the same time while VX is still above 13.95, a large sell-off could occur from the highs. Once the press conference starts Powell could say something negative about the jobs market and say they will plan on keeping rates higher for longer. That would be the trigger that CNBC would tell you is the reason for the sell-off.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Results**\n\nMy bullish scenario ended up playing out perfectly as expected. However, I made some big mistakes that day. I got the exact reaction I wanted, ES rallied up and then sold off hard. They were on CNBC saying things like \"Well the market obviously didn't like that, they wanted a rate cut\". This kind of thing is easily predictable if you've traded through FOMC meetings and Powell pressers for several years.\n\nHowever, I made some big mistakes. I was overly aggressive and didn't manage risk very well. I was buying a combination of SPX 0dtes and some SPY calls with a little more time on them. If I was going to do this, I needed to be ready to cut those 0dtes quickly. I was fine with holding on to the longer-dated calls as long as 4870 didn't break, but I couldn't be sure that the rally I was expecting would take place before close, it could've easily stayed where it was and then rallied the next day, which is what ended up happening. \n\nI let 0dtes expire worthless in 3 different accounts including the challenge account. It was a big mistake, I was too stubborn about expecting a bounce. If I was that sure I should've loaded up on some calls that expired the next week instead and held overnight. I did end up averaging into more SPY calls by close, but I should've never held those 0dtes. It happens to the best of us. Trading is hard and I'm not here to hide my mistakes. I think learning from mistakes is much more important than learning from winners.\n\nI think everybody here knows what ended up happening by now. ES rallied on Thursday and continued into Friday. My prediction panned out and I made a lot of money, but there are still lessons to be learned here about risk management. I'll post some of my commentary from that day below, but that pretty much sums it up.

I am trying to be as transparent as I can which is why I post all the positions I take soon after I enter so nobody has questions about my legitimacy.\n\nUnfortunately, Kinfo doesn't support Schwab which is where I originally started the challenge. Since the challenge had already been going for several days I didn't want to create a new account and wait 2-3 days to transfer money so I will be continuing the small account challenge with Schwab. Everyone who's been following me knows I don't fake trades by now. \n\nI did however create a new TradeStation account so I could use it with Kinfo. It's only got 3 days of trades on it so far and I plan on being highly aggressive with this account to see how far I can run it up. These are not the types of trades I'm going to be taking in the small account challenge and I don't recommend anyone trade this way. I just wanted to have a verified Kinfo account with some gains to further prove my legitimacy. You can see it here:\n\nhttps://kinfo.com/p/AdvancedPlays \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TraderVue Update**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gx5mkrdk6hgc1.png?width=829&format=png&auto=webp&s=3cda28b0a4393e3a1eb6e047ba4cec4009c917b8\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/82vnhocu6hgc1.png?width=1650&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccf1e49799ec0a0b3df77eb0cc25730a2375b12f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/celqziwm6hgc1.png?width=1281&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a658c3f9e47f1fc95052912b1d56147149b1627\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z6t5smlo6hgc1.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=5272047fa0f12656850b6e9b3b9876182a69429d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ul6dlznr6hgc1.png?width=1649&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc5a78aa9c91193cc92c96bcc3b522e075614f9e\n\n**Total Profit for 2024**\n\nA lot of people have been curious about how I trade a larger account when compared to this challenge account. I'll post my realized profits from all of my Schwab accounts so far. I'm not trying to brag, I'm trying to help people understand that I am a legit profitable trader and have been building small accounts for years. I'm not scamming anyone or charging any money for this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2hy8amzxihgc1.png?width=1453&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d74ee790876fde62691de6c4d1853cb70034c9b\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Criticism**\n\nWhen I first started this challenge and posted it here, I expected there to be a lot of skepticism and snarky comments about how this challenge would not be possible and I'd blow up my account. However, the arrogance that was displayed here was something I was not quite expecting. I'm hoping to open some minds after showing 10 days of trading and some of my analysis and strategies. Most people probably think my risk management is terrible and I'd be telling people to jump into high-risk trades, which would cause heavy losses for those following me. If you take a few minutes to review my trading and analysis I think you might be surprised.\n\nI do want to thank those of you who have been following and trying to learn with an open mind. I never expected to have this many people following so quickly, but it's been a great time. I have enjoyed hanging out with y'all and discussing the market.  \n\n\n**FAQs**\n\n**Why are you doing this challenge?**\n\nAs the market has been rallying recently, I have been noticing an increase in the number of questions regarding getting started trading. People are asking where to begin, how much capital is required, what to trade, etc. The advice I've been seeing given has been so bad I can't even take it. I cringe so hard. It's clear that most traders have no actual clue what causes prices to move. Some traders make a nice living by not knowing how the market works, but they have found a pattern that works for them and they are consistently profitable. Good for those guys, but that wasn't enough for me. I wanted to know why prices moved. So I've decided now is a good time to do one of these small account challenges publicly. Hopefully, this will provide some guidance for new traders looking to get started without much capital. I'd also like to prove the traders claiming trading short-term OTM options by simply longing puts and calls is impossible and technical analysis doesn't work wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If you can really 25x an account in 90 days why are you wasting your time doing this? Can't you make $1 billion in 1-2 years by 25xing the account every 90 days?**\n\n Like I've said before, I really want to help new traders and educate them about the market. It is a very difficult thing to get into and it's full of bullshiters and scam artists. Even without the scams, it's still insanely difficult to find someone who can provide guidance and come up with a step by step plan to become a profitable trader. Everything is so confusing at first and there's important things I think you need to learn and understand before you begin other parts of your journey. I think I have some insanely valuable insights about how the market works and I'd like to share. My road to profitability was a horrible gut-wrenching experience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. \n\nI also want to copy and paste a comment I made previously about why I think the 25x every 90 days to $1 billion is one of the stupidest things I've ever heard.\n\nBig players have to be very careful about the way they trade. They risk facing serious liquidity issues and can move markets too far if they aren’t careful. \n\nThis is why I find it hilarious when people criticize me for this challenge and say things like “well shit if you could actually grow a small account like that you’d be able to hit 1 billion dollars within 1-2 years if you 25x every 90 days.\n\nThis view is so short-sighted and misguided. I could never trade with millions of dollars, I don’t know how to do that. The guys with massive portfolios have to be constantly managing risk and hedging. They need tons of data analysis and price forecasting models to help them make decisions. They are forced to hedge and rotate in and out of different sectors.\n\nI don’t want to be like those guys and it would take me another 5 years of learning to even be able to do it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**More Notes About Furus**\n\n I know some of these guys have made over $5 million selling $300-$500 courses. Seems like a nice alternative to exposing yourself to incredible risk every day in the markets. Nothing is ever a sure thing in the market and you can lose it all with one or two big mistakes.   If I can transition to teaching and only trading small size for demonstration purposes I would love to do that. I'd much rather have some passive income and a trading community rather than trying to sling $100k options positions every day, I don't think I could handle it. My method of managing risk is to simply not put very much money in the account. I've blown tons of accounts, but I've always been fine because I lose very little, yet hit huge winners when I'm right. Generally, the major percentage of the money that's in my accounts is all profit because I never put more than $5-$10k in an account and frequently empty my accounts after big winners.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is your strategy?**  \n\nFor the most part, my strategy is very simple. Which is hilarious when you consider the amount of time I spent digging through rabbit holes and talking to thousands of people about it. I have some core beliefs that I feel very strongly about based on everything I've learned about the market: \n\n* Stock prices are manipulated to their highest point possible by wholesale stock operators and then they begin a distribution period. After they are done distributing and price falls, they being accumulating and start the process all over again.\n* Dow Theory Works. All stocks generally move in unison, there are some outliers, but for the most part, they move in unison. There is generally a major trend and minor trend that they follow with some shorter-term trends as well. Each trend has its own phase and it works this way because of the methods wholesale stock operators use to manipulate prices. You can read more on Dow Theory here: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dowtheory.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dowtheory.asp)\n* Simple TA works. I have tried many indicators and setups over the years and I know which ones work and why they work. You will never see me using something like the MACD or RSI. No offense if you use these indicators and if they work for you by all means use them. We are all different traders. However, the thing about indicators like MACD is it's actually pretty useless. I can look at any chart and tell you if the MACD is crossing over or not. It's just a difference between some different moving average prices which can be seen with a quick glance at a candlestick chart. The main TA I use is simple horizontal/resistance lines along with other simple patterns like wedges, bull/bear flags, head and shoulders, and trend lines. I also use the VX price action heavily in my analysis.\n* Supply and Demand works. The market is all about supply and demand. There are constanytl buyer and seller imbalances that are created on ES and other futures. You can take advantage of this if you can identify where these imbalances are and understand why they are there.\n* VX doesn't lie. When you think about the way VX works, it's actually sort of impossible for it to lie. Nothing is ever 100%, but it's close. The VX is perhaps the most important part of my strategy. It allows me to tie everything together and understand what the current market conditions are. I have some crazy stuff I've seen with the VX. I am planning to make a video about what was potentially the best VX trade setup in history. I'm hoping to drill this into you so you can learn to understand market conditions as well. I was convinced that price should've bounced last Wednesday on FOMC and just flat out couldn't believe it. I was stunned. The reason is because when I use the VX strategies they work 9/10 times. You might think I sound crazy claiming to have a strategy that works 9/10 times, but you will see it does if you follow my commentary. Price did eventually rally as expected after FOMC it just didn't work out right away. I was honestly in shock and that's why I believe I just sort of froze and let my 0dtes expire worthless. I made a mistake by aggressively buying 0dtes when I could have bought more time and still made plenty of money.\n* Being a master of your own psychology is the most important thing in trading. I think perhaps the most valuable thing you can learn from me is my psychology. I have dumped some information in ⁠the psychology channel and I have some more I'm just trying to organize things. It feels like I've dumped 5 years of my life in here and it's kind of weird. I hope it helps someone. it has been an interesting experience trying to reflect and articulate to other traders what my experiences have been like. I have worked incredibly hard on it and read more books than I can even remember on the topic. It's always the most simple things that end up helping the most though and they can be hard to understand if you have no experience. That's why I hope I can provide a template to master your psychology without all the noise and BS you might find elsewhere.\n* The market is not efficient, it is far from it. There are crazy inefficiencies you can exploit every single day. The efficient market hypothesis people are just as ignorant as the ones who say TA doesn't work.\n* &#x200B;\n\n**Every trade I've seen you make has been calls. Don't you buy any puts?**  \n\nWe are currently in one of the strongest bull markets in history. Due to my strong belief in Dow Theory, I will typically never take a trade that goes against the major trend unless a minor trend is well established. I know by going against the trend I am decreasing my odds of making money and adding more risk than needed. The trend is your friend, I will say it over and over.   If I go against the trend I am usually just speculating with small size and I know it's a gamble. Friday was the first day I have purchased a put that wasn't a hedge since October and it was a for fun gamble trade to see if I was right. I wasn't willing to risk more than $500 on it because it's going against the current trend, which is against everything I stand for.", "id": "1aidvvu", "created_utc": 1707016098.0, "score": 57, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 41, "comments": [{"body": "You weren't kidding when you said this one was long 😂\n\nAwesome stuff man!

So i put those 2k in as a bet that either it will be worth a model 3 in a few years, or Tesla fails and there will be no model 3 for me to buy anyway. I made my model 3 money sooner than expected, but actually decided to take a big chunk of it out to an ETF as my retirement fund at the peak of the pandemic bubble. Couldn't stay completely out of TSLA and i still have a big chunk of skin in the game, but last couple of years has been tough to stay positive.The irony of it is that FSD, which was my initial trigger, is not here yet.

Therefore this is where I DCA now. On 5 year horizon I expect (hope) TSLA to perform a lot better, but it relies too much on the motivations of a single man, the outstanding and perfect execution of his (current) plan, with favorable market winds and regulatory support. High risk high reward. I could say I think the stock is oversold at the moment, and we can gamble on that for the short/mid/5 year term, but I don't put all my eggs there. Until the recent 20% drop I was about 50/50 on TSLA and ETF. With the TSLA being my risky retire-earlier-and-buy-a-house-or-nothing part of it. The ETF my \"real\" savings fund that I actually rely on.\n\nRegarding FSD, I disagree with you when you imply it is a sure thing because it trains itself. This is the impression I got from the first investor presentation: there's a system that collects data for free from human drivers, the NN is trained automatically and it's just a matter of time until it perfects itself. At the time I even  thought (wrongly) that training would be done in each car and compute power was unlimited. Reality is that even though they have *access* to a crap-ton of driving data, NN training is done through a limited bandwidth with video being uploaded to the mothership and manually curated and annotated. Even with end-to-end NNs I do not see evidence that this bandwidth for data collection is increasing - still video (\"photons in\") being selectively uploaded and *somehow* curated to train the NN and generate a monthly CSV file. They seem to be progressing on the centralized compute power with GPUs and Dojo, however this is a downstream bottleneck. Training with simulations is also just a clutch, for some linear acceleration, that competitors also have. Some of the last presentations I saw (from Karpathy?) seemed to hint at auto labeling and a fully closed-loop system, using NN for the data annotation. However, I have seen no evidence that this is has had significant progress, or Elon would be bragging about it. Instead we hear about \"4D video\" and \"photons in controls out\" which is mainly about inference efficiency/accuracy. Only auto-labeling, taking advantage of the decentralized fleet compute power to do annotation, can possibly lead to exponential progress and the system training itself. As long as I see youtubers pressing a button to send video of a disengagement, this proves to me we are not there yet.  What I see so far is 5 years of \"in two weeks\", blaming it on edge cases, local maxima and the march of nines. Progress through this march of nines (sequential 10x reduction of failure rate) implies exponential increase in edge-case processing speed. As I tried to describe this is a bottleneck not necessarily solved by more cars and more Dojos. (not a NN specialist, this is just my dumb opinion and limited understanding like any other's.)\n\nSo, I think V12 (or whatever the masses get) will be very impressive at first, but again a local maximum. Reliable only in certain areas were they actually focused the training. Massive release may be coming soon, but  I do not think that mass adoption will lead to exponential progress due to the data collection bottleneck, even with massive compute power for training.  I'm afraid global general purpose FSD is still far away (minimum 5 years). It is a strong possibility that the global release is premature and there  will be a few years of FUD and strongly biased reporting with all the failures coming from around the world where Elon and our favorite youtubers have not tested it personally. This will delay regulatory approval and tarnish the impression of the general public. Only after we are through that phase, robotaxi can take-off globally or FSD sold as a service to other OEMs, to finally justify the expected market value. If the cost of robotaxi is too high and relies on FSD for viability/profitability, and FSD is not there, then stock price is likely to instantly tank deeper than ever, on some tragic earnings call where Elon casually spills the beans. For a general purpose Optimus I expect similar type of issue, even though it may actually become a viable product as factory worker/repetitive tasker much sooner, as individual skills are specifically trained. \n\nMy scenario is a bit pessimistic, just to illustrate what I think well within the range of possibilities. I believe nonetheless they can get there eventually and, if it happens, Tesla will be the first for sure. I just hope I am wrong regarding the timeline and Elon doesn't quit or find a new \"girlfriend\" in the meantime. The man has recently shown that he is not reliable in that sense. Even though he has a proven record of tenacity and execution, I don't think he is necessarily loyal to Tesla. \nSo I will keep my half-position, but this is not a \"sure thing\" that I would trust with my life savings.\n\nThanks for reading through the long post, I got carried away.
