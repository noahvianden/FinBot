As when you own a large slice of the market for essential goods, you can simply raise prices, and they will be paid. Biden admin recently addressed this for the grocery corps. But grocery, shipping, and producers have heavily consolidated in recent years, as have most industries.\n\nWith the recent progress of tech, there is big efficiencies gained by industry consolidation. See amazon. But those industries also attain market, employment and regulatory control with their resources. And jobs continue to be \"de-skilled\" by efficiency and automation, which is used as a reason to keep pay low. \n\nI'm not sure what this all means for the economy or the market.

I believe this is causing the price for housing to get bid up higher and higher. And that's causing more and more increased compensation to mid and junior employees at those companies. Corperations can afford it because they set the prices with their monolithic market shares. \n\n Housing inflation is out of control and has been a while. CPI is not weighing it properly, probably by including unliveable areas where prices haven't increased. I say unliveable because that's places with no jobs or attractiveness for young people to stay or move to. It's nice boomer farmers and countryfolk aren't seeing as much inflation. \n\nBut in more lively areas to live, it's crazy, cost of essentials has doubled in only a few years. That's why there's been an influx in homelessness in those urban areas. People who were barely getting by are pushed to the margins. Either leave the only place you know with all your connections, or just move into your car or a tent. \n\nI've seen first hand people go down that slippery slope.

I am trying to help the regards that only know NVDA MSFT AAPL TSLA AMD AI AMZN ETC. Put out that helping hand for the gamblers that have been eating red crayons alot! \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gicjys75iegc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b36291a99c5cf39471ce20caba518585484405ef\n\nNot every company is going to take us to the moon. It is ok to have a company that can pay you a steady 10-12% dividend with some appreciation. In comes Prospect Capital or PSEC. This company has been public since 2004. It is a BDC or business development company. Under the law they must pay 90% of their total profits in the form of dividends. So it is important to note that the company must sustain earnings in order to do that. In the past, many people have worried about a dividend cut at any company, however, PSEC has paid out over 4.1 billion dollars since 2004! Their 6 cents every month, 72 cent per share dividend has been in place for over 5 years! Please check!\n\nLast night I reviewed their most recent earnings report. 11/8/2023 \\[They will have one within 2 weeks\\] The 10Q official report was 151 pages! I spent roughly 2 hours doing so!\n\nIt is a very complicated investment company. They have stakes and investments in over [400 companies]. \n\nA regard wants a gold star and its 128 companies.\n\nOver 50% of their sales/income come in the form of high yielding loans. Most of which are at 10-12%. Most smaller companies can not borrow 10-50 or 100 million from a bank.. in turn they seek out private equity or a company like PSEC.. Most of these loans are first line secured, which means PSEC has a stake or can take the assets if a loan goes sour. 2 hours of course is not enough time to review all the companies and a full report… but 2 hours is enough to tell you the company dividend is in tact!\n\nPSEC fell a lot over the past 2 weeks… 6.30 to 5.70 because the optimism of a Fed Rate cut has dissipated. Many BDCs go up as rates drop, because investors are attracted to the yield that these can provide if the return on their cash goes down… Which is why I am posting this now….\n\nThis is an opportunity as the stock sits at 5.84 and even 6.30 is fairly cheap for what you are getting, along with the risk/reward. I can see this going to 6.50 – 7.. Which implies close to 20%, with very limited risk to the downside…\n\nThe COO/President has purchased 80,000 shares at an average price near 5.85 in November/December, that is near 500K, for someone with a 175K salary and a networth that is below 10 million. The CFO and CFO’s husband has also purchased shares during the 4th Quarter. The CEO owns nearly 20% of the company at nearly 70 million shares with no salary. \n\nJust providing ideas in case people are worried that the market has come up to far, to fast!
