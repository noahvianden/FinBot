{"title": "Home Depot misses on revenue, as high interest rates hurt sales  ", "selftext": "Home Depot on Tuesday posted quarterly revenue below Wall Street‚Äôs expectations, as shoppers postponed bigger discretionary projects like bath and kitchen remodels because of higher interest rates and made spring purchases late.\n\nStill, the home improvement retailer reaffirmed its full-year guidance, which includes an additional week from the prior year. It said it expects total sales to grow about 1% in fiscal 2024, including those extra days. However, the retailer said it anticipates comparable sales, which take out the impact of store openings and closures, to decline about 1%, excluding that additional week.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail said customers are in a waiting game that began in the second half of last year, as they responded to mortgage rates climbing. He said the company anticipated those trends would continue.\n\n‚ÄúThe home improvement customer is extremely healthy from a financial perspective,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd so it‚Äôs not the case of not having the ability to spend. What they tell us is they‚Äôre just simply deferring these projects as given higher rates, it just doesn‚Äôt seem the right moment to execute.‚Äù\n\nHere‚Äôs what the company reported for the three-month period that ended April 28 compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $3.63 vs. $3.60 expected\n\nRevenue: $36.42 billion vs. $36.66 billion expected\n\nNet income for the fiscal first quarter decreased to $3.6 billion, or $3.63 per share, from $3.87 billion, or $3.82 per share, in the year-ago period. Net sales fell 2.3% from $37.26 billion.\n\nComparable sales dropped 2.8% in the fiscal first quarter across the business and declined 3.2% in the U.S.\n\nHome Depot is contending with a tougher housing backdrop, which has dampened demand for do-it-yourself projects. About half of Home Depot‚Äôs sales come from DIY customers, and the other half come from pros like roofers and landscapers.\n\nAs interest rates remain high, consumers have been reluctant to move out of their homes and into new ones ‚Äî the kind of turnover that often inspires home projects. Higher interest rates have also dinged the desire for larger-scale projects that can require financing. For the past several quarters, Home Depot has seen customers buy fewer big-ticket items and take on more modest projects ‚Äì a trend that persisted in the most recent quarter.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, customers made fewer visits to Home Depot‚Äôs stores and website and tended to spend less when they did. Customer transactions declined 1% to 386.8 million and average ticket fell 1.3% to $90.68.\n\nHome Depot has seen sales moderate after more than two years of explosive demand during the Covid pandemic. The company posted its worst revenue miss in nearly two decades and cut its forecast in the year-ago first quarter. Home Depot‚Äôs sales totaled $152.7 billion in the fiscal year that ended in late January, a drop of 3% year over year.\n\nInflation may also be playing a role in that pullback, as consumers spend more money on essentials and have to make trade-offs when spending discretionary income.\n\nHowever, McPhail said Home Depot is not seeing customers trade down to cheaper items, like less expensive power tools or appliances. He pinned the company‚Äôs softer sales in large part on consumers‚Äô ‚Äúdeferral mindset‚Äù and a housing market that has slowed dramatically.\n\n‚ÄúWhen we have seen mortgage rates decrease slightly, as we saw at the beginning of this quarter, the housing turnover seems to respond quickly and sharply in a positive direction,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd so we think that‚Äôs an indicator that there is a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for household formation and housing turnover and the larger projects that are associated with housing turnover.‚Äù\n\nWeather pressured sales, too, in the recent quarter, he said. Spring is the biggest sales season for home improvement retailers, including Home Depot. Yet customers delayed outdoor purchases because of colder and wetter weather in many parts of the country, he said.\n\nThose spring purchases have begun to pick up as the weather improves, he said.\n\nTo overcome slower sales, the home improvement retailer has revved up its strategy to attract pros, since they tend to buy larger quantities and offer a steadier source of sales. Home Depot announced in late March that it would acquire SRS Distribution, a Texas-based specialty distributor of roofing, landscaping and pool supplies, for $18.25 billion in the largest acquisition in the company‚Äôs history. Home Depot has a growing network of distribution centers across the country that can store and deliver roofing shingles, insulation and other supplies straight to job sites.\n\nAlong with wooing pros, Home Depot is trying to drive growth by opening about a dozen new stores this fiscal year and adding features to improve its online and in-store experience.\n\nShares of Home Depot closed Monday at $340.96. So far this year, Home Depot‚Äôs shares have fallen about 2% compared with the roughly 9% gains of the S&P 500.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/14/home-depot-hd-q1-2024-earnings-.html", "id": "1crp3kp", "created_utc": 1715683528.0, "score": 158, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "My bad guys, I got some spackle at Lowes instead of HD this weekend.", "score": 95, "replies": [{"body": "I evened it out by getting some baby proofing things for cabinets there instead of target.
