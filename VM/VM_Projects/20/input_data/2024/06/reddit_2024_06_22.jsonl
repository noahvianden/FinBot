I mean it terrifies me how this technology just in general will affect daily lifes of everyone. Just imagine that with we will be going into taxi which will have driver who is robot and is capable of full conversation with you (scaries is we can already do this type of thing) and now imagine what will this result in what like just few years? \n\nImagine that your taxes will be managed by robots who will send police reinforcements to your location to arerrest you if you dont pay your taxes. This is not just some sort of internet boom, call me crazy but i think if you dont invest in any company which got any sort of deal with NVDIA for manufacturing of chips, which are nessesery to run this technology (oversimplified as fuck btw)\n\nSo if you ask me what i think about NVDIA, my  hot take is that it will go up to 10 trilion by end of next year and i also want some of your opinions about this as well, since i want to know what you as casual retail traders/investors think about it. \n\nThank you for your attention, Deathors", "id": "1dlyoem", "created_utc": 1719071415.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.34, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 38 minutes ago\n**Total Comments** | 2 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 1 year | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Here's the thing with the AI boom.

In reality, changes happen as slowly as watching paint dry because society and people take forever to adapt.\n\nHere's the funny part: the only thing that‚Äôs actually changing fast is people‚Äôs excitement over the newest gadget or idea. Every time someone figures something out, they think, \"Eureka!

I like to think of AI in phases because AI will certainly not fade away and die out. But as a business software developer working at a large company in financial information systems, I get a ton of questions about how we can use AI for this or that.  And the answer, a lot of times, is that we really don't need to or wouldn't want to.  Maybe AI could analyze our transactions and find opportunities for reduced costs or something.  I don't know, nothing like that has yet been proposed.  But it would immediately get huge pushback because of security concerns and a bunch of other stuff both real and imagined.  And most of what we do is so simple and repetitive that we really don't need AI to do it.  \n\nI don't think much from this current phase of AI will make it's way into the boring business world except maybe chatbots and search engines and other stuff that employees don't use all that much.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Ok.
