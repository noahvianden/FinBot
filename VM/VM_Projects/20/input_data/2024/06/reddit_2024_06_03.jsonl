Like, it's reasonable to look at the economic state of the world, and the fact that AI is potentially a bubble since LLMs are failing to deliver more value this year.\n\nNVIDIA has more than a good chance of sinking hard if there are any bumps along what looks like an extremely rocky road for the world. China is about to fall apart and folks don't think that will affect all markets??\n\nWhat exactly is \"AI\" delivering this year other than some hype? It's definitely not performing exponentially, we are still waiting for something new from OpenAI and GPT4o is just fluff.\n\nIf the internet had a bubble, and the internet truly changed the world at a fundamental level, why isn't AI a bubble? The potential for LLMs is far more narrow than the internet. Way fewer business opportunities. Amazon was not possible before the internet, for example. So many massive businesses have been enabled by the internet. LLMs are simply a tool, they will not enable entirely new types of business, just enhance what we already have and we are saying that NVIDIA is going to be the biggest business in the world based on that???\n\nLet's not forget NVIDIA is simply a first mover. Others will catch up. My only dilemma is when to sell, not if I sell. I cannot see this as a long-term investment, the longer I wait the more of a chance NVIDIA will correct hard and never come back.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "/s.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Accelerate.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "i am trying to scope out why AMD is headed the opposite way today?  they are at the same Taiwan conference, both presenting on AI.  \n\n  \nIs this just a fluke, or did AMD say something the people at the conference did not like?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Unlike Intel, which just fractured their own legs, Nvidia hasn't stopped innovating.
