{"title": "Call Ratio Back Spread: The perfect strategy for meme stocks before they moon?", "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/2lzijkh3cr5d1.png?width=1541&format=png&auto=webp&s=764783c93588b7592010be4003454bd2c9451640\n\ntldr: The call backspread ratio seems like a good play for stocks that may be ready to moon or to sink. It takes advantage of the current low volatility on the call side before an event. This allows unlimited room for profit should the underlying shoot up suddenly, while still limiting risk.\n\n# BASICS\n\n**## WHAT**\n\nA **CALL RATIO BACKSPREAD** is a more advanced strategy involving selling a vertical call spread and buying extra long calls.\n\nIt is a very bullish strategy that benefits from large upside moves and increasing volatility.\n\n**## WHO**\n\nThis is not for AAPL or SPY. We are really only focusing on meme stocks before things get crazy. Or any stock that has the potential to moon in a short period. G·∏æE is the clear example. I theorize you could have run this basically at any point after the first fiasco before this recent pump, when things died down, and done fine, as long as you were managing it an rolling when needed.\n\n**## WHY**\n\nSo why would you use this strategy over, say, a simpler one. Essentially you don't know what will happen with the stock. There is a lot of hype around it and maybe a lot of excitement on other particular subs. So you could sell puts, buy calls, buy stock and sell CCs, etc. I could go over the downsides of all of these on meme stocks but to put it simply, only one of those strategies has unlimited upside potential and none of them have no downside risk.\n\n**## WHEN**\n\nPut this on before things get crazy. You could **not** do this in G·∏æE currently and probably wouldn't want to do this for some other stocks that have had their day. I will get into this more in specifics.\n\n**## HOW**\n\nTo setup this trade you SELL a VERTICAL SPREAD while buying another LONG CALL at the same strike as your VERTICAL LONG CALL. e.g. Stock is at 100 -> sell 1 CALL @ 110 strike & buy 2 CALLS @ 120 strike. That is a 1:2 ratio, but you could have any kind of ratio you want: 1:2, 1:3, 2:3, 5:8, etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zwhs07a4cr5d1.png?width=2948&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bbd924f6766496407a6b67addfd2fc01bc1281d\n\n# SPECIFICS\n\n**## GREEKS**\n\n**Delta**: You don't need to worry about delta. We don't care about being delta positive, negative, or neutral here. You will not hedge deltas.\n\n**Theta**: This trade should be put on for a small net credit. In theory that means it is theta positive. But in practice this is not so simple. Theta changes over time. If the stock stays in the same place for the entire trade it will go from negative to positive. But it can fluctuate between positive and negative depending on where you are on the graph.\n\n**Vega**: Positive to neutral. Your profit line will sink into the valley when IV goes down, but the further into the valley you are, the higher the Vega. We want Vega to increase on the underlying.\n\n**## STRIKES**\n\nA lot of folks like to put their short strike right ATM. I'm not a fan of that for this case, since small upward drift will cause max loss on the position. I prefer much further out strikes. Further OTM strikes lessens the initial negative theta because the drag from the valley is less harsh. At least +10% from the underlying on our short strikes. Since we are looking for extreme upward moves, we want to avoid getting caught in the top of a consolidation or channel.\n\n**## DTE**\n\nA longer DTE > 60 days is my preference. By using a much longer dated expiration we can eliminate the noise of the stock and just focus on the moonshot. This also allows you to roll easier.\n\n**## CREDIT**\n\nThe smaller the credit, the smaller max loss. The trade off being your possible ROC. I would try for about 6% of MAX RISK. Play around with the numbers to find what works for you.\n\n**## SKEW**\n\nThis is one of the more important parts of the setup to this trade. You need to look at the structure of the options chain for the same DTE. We are looking for a normal volatility SKEW on the CALL side to take advantage of the low IV of out of the money calls. This strategy aims to catch a meme stock before take off. A high SKEW environment makes it impossible to put on for a credit, since it means OTM calls are much more expensive than normal. If we look at G·∏æE right now, you will not be able to put this on for a credit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4es7n65cr5d1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bee214dbf08b5a7dd8c2817eb8dcd471960c52d\n\n**## VALLEY of DEATH**\n\nIn the location between your chosen strikes is the \"valley of death\". The valley of death will drag your profit line down on the left side (downside) of the graph, before expiration. This is why I'm proposing this as a meme stock play. Slow grinds up are not your friend here.\n\n**## RISKS**\n\nIf setup correctly for a **NET CREDIT**, there is NO DOWNSIDE RISK & LIMITED UPSIDE RISK. Your risk lies in the valley between your strikes and a little bit to the left of the valley before expiration. So your absolute risk in the trade is the width of the strikes minus the credit when you nail the absolute bottom of the valley.\n\n**PIN RISK** is a real issue should the stock not moon and hover just inside the valley. So just be aware and plan to close or roll well before expiration.\n\n**## OTHER THINGS**\n\nYou could also run a 2-2 1 which will cap your margin requirement and lower the valley of death to just a canyon of catastrophe. I kind of like this one better but it does require more contracts.\n\nThis could also be diagonalized to take advantage of a downward slop in the Term Structure.\n\n**## EXAMPLE**\n\nI just went over to WSB and looked for a DD. Found GNDR. It's the stupidest DD but it works as an example.\n\nVol SKEW for Aug 16th looks ok.

You can improve this strategy by rolling the weekly to the exact same strike for a loss until the stock comes back down. \n\nSo in this case I would buy $100 strike yearly for like $5 and sell the $25 weekly every week. In two weeks you will pay off the 100 strike. If you lose money on any week you roll to the next at the same strike and you pay probably $1-2 to buy yourself time for the stock to come back down.

{"title": "PETCO ($WOOF) - Levered Bet on  New Leadership & EBITDA Growth", "selftext": "**The TL;DR**\n\n* **SG&A Cuts Is The Only Way to Grow** - Given the current state of the US pet industry, the only way Petco can meaningfully grow profits is through cutting SG&A. Every 1% point of SG&A cut, adds \\~6% points of EBITDA growth\n\n* **Prior Leadership Didn't Touch SG&A - Now They're Out** - SG&A spend has conspicuously grown while Petco struggled. It's not surprising then that the CEO, COO, and \"Chief Customer Officer\" have been pushed out. Petco's Board clearly wants more bold leadership to turnaround the struggling pet retailer\n\n* **Ample Room to Reduce SG&A** - Comparing current SG&A spend against (i) historical levels as well as (ii) Petsmart indicate there's well over $215M of SG&A reduction opportunity\n\n* **Margin of Safety on 2024 Performance** - Given that market share losses are abating and gross margins are stabilizing, current trends imply Petco's 2024E Adj. EPS will be $0.00. However, the consensus analyst forecast is for $(0.05). Petco‚Äôs financial performance thus has room to underperform against recent trends, limiting near-term downside risk on the stock\n\n* **Only Need to Be Right \\~10% Of The Time** ‚Äì If new leadership is able to cut $215M of SG&A spend, we could see the stock rise up to $13.46 a share (+269%). The downside to Petco‚Äôs stock price is likely $2.45 (-33%), the price before Petco‚Äôs 1Q 2024 earnings. While speculative on how new leadership will act, this bet only needs to work \\~10% of the time to be profitable\n\nThis is not financial advice / recommendation to invest in Petco. I'm just memorializing my reasons for buying Petco. Currently holding 13,750 shares.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h66l9iyi4r5d1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=533c616defc81ed5426b1a708fc4e9fc7c63185f\n\n**Cutting SG&A is the Only Way to Meaningfully Grow EBITDA**\n\nWe can think of how Petco can grow profits with a simple framework: either (i) increase revenue, (ii) expand gross margins, or (iii) cut SG&A spend.\n\nThe opportunity to grow revenue is very small. The US pet industry is forecasted to grow 2% this year. Petco, unfortunately, has a revenue mix that skews more heavily towards supplies & live animals (35% of Petco LTM revenue vs. 21% for the industry), which is forecasted to not grow at all. With Petco struggling to maintain market share and low overall market growth, Petco cannot rely on revenue growth to grow profits.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggv80zll4r5d1.png?width=1073&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d90f45eec8c63597a1aab270c2706b537e36885\n\nFurthermore, Petco's gross margin faces headwinds. Sales of discretionary Supplies & Companion Animals (e.g., toys, clothes, litter boxes) -- which are \\~70 points higher margin than Consumables (e.g., pet food, treats) -- have been declining as pet owners focused on essentials in the face of high inflation. What's more, Petco began introducing value brands (Fancy Feast, Pedigree) to its merchandising strategy last year, further dragging margins. With these headwinds at play, Petco's efforts to squeeze out gross margin improvement amounts to little more than running just to stay-in-place.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8q2sz2cp4r5d1.png?width=1075&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0a58a6170a5d9a60af688f477d6bb5cd2bd4cab\n\n**Prior Management Let SG&A Grow, Despite Challenging Market**\n\nThat leaves cutting SG&A spend to grow EBITDA. Curiously, SG&A spend has actually continuously grown year-over-year. Progress on the $150M of run-rate cost savings announced in 2Q 2023 (of which $40M was supposed to be achieved in year one, much of it in G&A) are nowhere to be seen.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/su3ilzbs4r5d1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=bca83e938f8e16a7ef81820d8191e996b845ee10\n\n**Ample Room to Reduce SG&A**\n\nThere should be opportunity to cut SG&A spend, however. Historically, Petco spent between 32-35% of its revenue on SG&A. Petsmart, a lower-end pet retail chain, historically spent between 25-27% of its revenue on SG&A. If Petco were to reduce its SG&A spend back to historical levels, there would be $215M of EBITDA uplift. Notably, this would only amount to a 9% reduction in SG&A spend but generate a 59% lift to EBITDA.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7v67faev4r5d1.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7871f479e0cbe1b0e48f74723b3b92165c114db\n\nIt's notable that Ron Coughlin (Petco's prior CEO) did not try to cut SG&A.  He joined Petco in 2018 when it was struggling against ecommerce competition and revamped Petco's strategy -- focusing on omnichannel selling, a premium merchandising assortment and a vet hospital network buildout.  Under his leadership, Petco went from declining comparable sales to 18 consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth.\n\nAs much as that performance deserves respect, he also benefitted from a strong pet retailing backdrop.  During his 5 years at Petco, the US pet industry grew at a 10% CAGR, boosted by a surge of pet adoptions during COVID.  Now the US Pet Industry has entered a period of low growth (2% growth for 2024E).  I find it reasonable (and astute) that the Board would want new leadership.  Ron drove a turnaround in Petco focusing on growing revenue with a strong pet industry backdrop.  Today, Petco needs leadership that's focused on cost containment to weather the next few years.\n\n**Margin of Safety on 2024 Performance**\n\nWhat prior management has done is stabilized the business. Last year management announced an \"operational reset\" whereby Petco would start offering value brands and drive gross margin improvement with merchandising optimization & supply chain efficiency.\n\nWith the 1Q 2024 earnings report and 2Q 2024 guidance ($1.525B of revenue and $(0.02) EPS), we‚Äôre now seeing Petco‚Äôs rate of market share loss abating and gross margins stabilizing. Continuation of these trends would result in 2024 Revenue of $6.21B and Adj. EPS of $0.00.\n\nHowever, consensus analyst forecasts are more conservative ($6.15B of Revenue and $(0.05) of EPS), which would only happen if either (i) Petco misses its 2Q 2024 guidance or (ii) its performance deteriorated in 2H 2024. Perhaps analysts feel the need for extra conservatism given last year 3Q‚Äô23 miss on Revenue and EPS. Or perhaps analysts feel the need to bake in extra conservatism because Petco is not providing full year guidance given the management transition. Ultimately though, that conservatism creates a margin of safety for share price performance and skews the risk in favor of Petco beating analyst forecast.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mo0tzkvz4r5d1.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=c446470845f8b2fb65e62221d4eb0b00324ef9fc\n\n**$13.46 ‚Äì Upside Target on Share Price**\n\nGrowing EBITDA is absolutely critical to unlocking value with Petco.¬† Currently, Petco trades at a discount to its 2015 Buyout and 2021 IPO valuation.¬† Much of this is due to Petco‚Äôs bleak prospects ‚Äì a low growth market and gross margin headwinds.¬† Additionally, with EBITDA now at $366M and interest expense at $145M, Petco struggles to generate sufficient FCF to invest in the business, such as opening more vet hospitals.\n\nCutting SG&A spend by $215M would put the company back in a position to invest & drive secular growth. I would expect the valuation of the company to re-rate back to 9.0x EBITDA, translating to a $13.46 share price (269% premium to current levels).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x9atz4b35r5d1.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fd5f16fc5dc24ac622e5492e2253885d1994b29\n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\nI'm an outsider sitting behind a desk with no experience in pet retailing. Perhaps prior leadership already looked into cutting SG&A spend and had a good reason to leave it untouched.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the leadership ranks have been shaken up at Petco.  The stock is down big from its 2021 IPO price of $18 a share and Petco's private equity owners (CVC Capital Partners and CPPIB) now are coming on their 9th year of holding this investment.  As far as I can tell, they did not pull a dividend recap during their hold period and have not recouped their investment yet.  They need the stock price up and fast.\n\nSo while I'm speculating on how new leadership will act, I think it's a well-educated guess.

I would estimate that the remaining \\~$1.2B of SG&A expense is mostly payroll and benefit costs (e.g., health insurance)", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

That means Petco is gonna have a horrible quarter. \n\nThe only way brick and mortar store can compete with Chewy is via service that require physical presence, like vet care, boarding and grooming.
