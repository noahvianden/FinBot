While I agree that if all cars were a Tesla S,Y,X,3 (mostly 3/y) then that might be a good move but while humans still operate vehicles this would be a nightmare scenario. My FSD with 3 witnesses pulled out of a parking lot onto the closest lane (right) and it immediately switched to the left lane which I thought was fine because I needed to turn left in 4 miles but then…. It freaking turned into the turn lane and started driving down it with the right turn blinker never shutting off. Not only that, version 12.3 and early 12.4 could easily drive up/down a gravel driveway (it’s a mapped lane) but the latest version outside of Tesla employees now tried to drive me into the road sign at that driveway so I have to stop there and turn in manually (keep in mind this is gravel but it’s a mapped lane- road type) then when I turn FSD back on the car just drives a little down this straight road and then stops (slams brakes on gravel) so I have to drive up it but it can still drive back down and then turn into the road just fine. What is that about? Code regression you say? Correct, they reintroduced some scenario that likely breaks that old functionality. My car also hits a ruble strip (yellow line) for no reason the same place it always did in older version. This tells me that specific code from older versions was put back in. Not for the best, it was working perfectly until that. I mean that particular route, it’s still very dangerous and way too slow to drive me around.

{"title": "Anyone excited for Nebius (Yandex) resuming trading on Nasdaq this Monday?", "selftext": "Nebius, the company formerly known as Yandex that’s now focused on cloud infrastructure for AI uses (aka “AI compute”), is to begin trading on the public markets once again — more than two years after the Nasdaq halted trading due to economic sanctions imposed in the wake of Russia’s Ukraine invasion in 2022.\n\nThe Netherlands-based company is vying to become one of Europe’s leading players in the burgeoning “GPU-as-a-service” space, and sits in a somewhat unique position — it is a startup in many ways as it’s starting out afresh as a new business, but being a public company means that anyone can invest in it as an alternative to the usual U.S. hyperscalers such as Alphabet or Microsoft.\n\nFounded in 1997, most people know Yandex as the “Google of Russia,” building everything from search engines and advertising products, to maps and autonomous vehicles. Yandex’s core market was very much its domestic Russia plus a handful of neighboring countries, however its parent was a Dutch holding organization called Yandex N.V. which went public on the Nasdaq in 2011, followed by a secondary listing three years later on the Moscow Exchange.\n\nYandex N.V. was doing well as a public company, reaching a valuation of $31 billion at the end of 2021 before the Russia-Ukraine conflict kickstarted a series of global sanctions against companies in the region, and also individuals. Yandex co-founder and CEO Arkady Volozh was forced to resign after the European Union placed him on a sanctions list, although he was removed from the list in March 2024 which paved the way for his return as CEO of the next version of Yandex N.V.\n\nThat next version is Nebius and its business is based on one of Yandex N.V.’s few remaining assets outside of Russia: a Finnish data center and AI cloud business called Nebius AI. The new entity formally emerged back in July, outlining its plans to be a “European AI compute leader,” similar to something like CoreWeave — a company that is also in the midst of expanding into Europe, raising a ton of equity and debt en-route.\n\nWhile the Nasdaq had said in 2022 that it would delist Yandex and several other Russian-affiliated companies, Yandex appealed and the Nasdaq agreed to maintain its listing — but keep a halt on trading as it went about severing its Russian ties. With those ties terminated earlier this year, and $2 billion in the bank from selling its Russian assets, Volozh said at the time that he intended to continue Nebius as a public company, as it was an easier and cheaper way to access capital, in what is a very capital intensive business.\n\n“Our ambition is to build one of the world’s largest specialist AI infrastructure businesses,” Volozh said in a statement. “This requires access to technological expertise, graphics processing units and capital. These are exactly what we have.”\n\nNebius said its Class A ordinary shares will resume trading on Monday, October 21, 2024.", "id": "1g6l4nk", "created_utc": 1729266076.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 5 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 7 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What about Ozon?!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "\"They had to rewrite all their code base in order to separate from Yandex.\"\n\nYes.
