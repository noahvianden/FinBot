They have 2 g42 supercomputers up and running based in the USA already with a 3rd coming online I believe this year. \nEach cluster is equivalent in compute to approx 224 dgx b200 so perhaps for large enterprises it will be worthwhile \n\n\nAt the end of the day I appreciate this is an nvidia sub so will be biased.

These are just the facts. My speculative assumption is that G42 is having difficulty training with Condor, they probably wants to focus their software efforts on the nvidia stack. Were they always intended for cloud inference? They said themselves, they don't have much in the way of other customers. 87% revenue comes from G42, so if that's the intention, to be a public cloud, it's not successful.\n\nWhy do I say they're running into problems with training on Condor? Look, where's the successor to Falcon? They had a couple of initial successes, then Falcon 2 is only 11B and failed to make a splash. They were early pioneers and got disappointingly lapped multiple times by a bunch of startups, Chinese firms, Meta, etc. All of these facts paint a picture of leaving cerebras for nvidia.\n\nAnyway I hope I adequately explained and supported my narrative.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You are leaping to conclusions on little info. The approval UAE got to import applies to all relevant advanced chips including Nvidia and Cerebras, not any specific company alone.\n\nUp until the agreement they were not able to access the latest chips for any company and that is why they earlier made agreement with Cerebras to build the datacenters in the US that Cerebras operates for them (\"Condor Galaxy\"). For the most part, that is what they have paid Cerebras for so far, Cerebras has not made deliveries  of their latest chips into UAE. G42 dial remotely into the datacenters remotely which was an acceptable compromise. The new approval will also enable them to build Cerebras hardware in UAE (in addition to anything they want to do with Nvidia).\n\nSecond G42 is not choosing between Nvidia and Cerebras, their strategy is of massive expansion because they see their country as trying to jump forward into advanced tech through AI, and also because AI uses gazillion energy and they have this just laying around with their oil/gas which they are trying to deemphasize as raw export. (I have my personal doubts on such an all-in AI strategy, but that is what they are doing). So they saw a big investment opportunity they could influence as an early customer with Cerebras, and they separately see other opportunities to use Nvidia hardware in other instances, they have more than enough money to do both.

National retail price of regular gasolein and diesel fell on weekly basis and are lower compared to a year before.\n*Transport consumes 60% of crude oil in form of refined products like gasoil and gasoline.\n\n#2 China gave significant stimulus to the economy by cutting lending rates and providing incentives to home buyers etc. Hang Seng index jumped some 25% in a week. But impact of policy changes [while reflected immediately in financial products & sectors] takes sometime to impact manufacturing, services and retail activities. China has been lagging behind in energy imports and consumption in 2024: massive sales of EV vehicles and switch to LNG for truckers are cited as major reasons, besides sluggish economy.\n\n#3 Germany's Q2 GDP report [released on 27th August] indicated -0.1% growth rate. Another quarter of such anemic growth and Germany will be under technical recession.\n\n#4 OPEC+ spare capacity: OPEC+ has imposed production cuts [5.7 million barrels per day] and given up market share to defend international crude oil prices.

As Intel will likely underperform until their longterm goals pay off I believe the stock will continue to fall unless there is good news like alot of Gaudi3 sales/preorders. Gaudi 3 is lower performance than Nvidias newest ai chip though.\n\nLong term-\n\nEverything Intel is doing are long term investments that will only pay off 2-5 yrs from now. Building fab projected to take 2 yrs, 18A architecture 1 yr to begin production but will require another year for mass production,14A 3 yrs. These projects has high risk of being delayed.\n\nShort term-\n\nOn the short term, great news that has yet to happen is Intel showing progress on using their new High NA EUV Lithography machine, improving issues like low output. This machine is more advanced than what TSMC has and is the one lead intel has over TSMC.\n\nThe best news possible in the short term for Intel would be TSMC being attacked by China. This would easily lead to Intel tripling in value as TSMC's main operations are landlocked in [Taiwan.Global](http://Taiwan.Global) Guardian experts put the likelihood of an all-out invasion at around 35%. Smaller scale escalations like interupting Taiwans trade will also greatly improve nana's position. Chinese military are already being accused of intentionally ramming into Philippine ships.\n\nLong term potential could be Astronomical if Intel succeeds in their reversal but competitors are also improving. Nvidia's Ai Chips for example are improving at a faster rate than Intel, making them unlikely to catch up in that area. However, their head start on the High NA EUV machine could make it possible to jump the gap against Nvidia. Tesla already thinking of ordering thousands of Nvidia's next gen AI chip set for 2025/26, Intel still has a very strong balance sheet with a large amount of equity, but debt is increasing at an alarming rate and there's rumors intel accounting methods are made to favor their books.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lf5ndqyrpvsd1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=69e644a13a0e590bb3d76907a5dba8fed5d39f2f", "id": "1fwjhl5", "created_utc": 1728106831.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 week ago\n**Total Comments** | 24 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I’m going to say it one last time, there will be no china-Taiwan war until TSMC has production ramped up somewhere else.

So the US will have to make a choice: stand by its principles and show the world it can be relied on in times of need, or chicken out and sell it as 'Murica Furst'. In the former case, the US economy will take a serious blow instantly but probably recovers relatively fast, as soon as alternatives are in place, while in the second case the US economy will take a long term serious blow as lots of strategic partners and allies will back off. Nothing is as bad as an unreliable trade partner who betrays its allies and partners. That's why I wrote in one of the other comments here that it will be a pyrrhic victory at best: Intel stock price won't win either way.\n\nAdd to that that a third big burning pit of instability, a third large war zone including some of the bigger forces in the world or in a region would actually have severe consequences for the whole world economy.

Both the USA and Russia have done it a few times in recent decades, China never did. Their \"world domination plan\" is more about using money and soft power to get their way with small countries. And after seeing what happened to Russia, they're probably even less inclined to start an invasion.\n\nTSMC is of of my biggest positions.

E.g., taking an island here or there and literally claiming almost the entire South China Sea and militarily fortifying it with dozens of strategically placed artificial islands.\n\nYou underestimate how scary Xi is because unlikely his predecessors, he has shown to be willing to tank China's economy for ideological (e.g., Covid lockdowns a full 18months after everywhere else in the world stopped) or political (e.g., support Russia in their Ukrainian War) purposes. And furthermore, unlike his predecessors, he has almost complete control of the CCP by wiping out nearly everyone that does not support him (even ex-President Hu got very publicly and un-ceremonially removed).\n\nAnd militarily, I doubt there is any active US general that would bet Taiwan winning over a Chinese invasion without significant and lightning-fast US and Japanese naval and air support. The Ukraine War has shown the significant deficiencies with Western Arms (e.g., precision missiles that are extremely expensive and slow to produce with maybe a month of stockpiles). \n\nWith an authoritarian government, you just need to outlast a democracy/republic based one. Look at the Ukraine War; lots of support initially that is slowly but steadily dwindling.
