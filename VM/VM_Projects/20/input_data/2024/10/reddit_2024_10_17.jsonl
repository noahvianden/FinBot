Include price and fundamental data in your summary if possible. At the end of your message, end with a rating for each stock in the analysis on a scale 1-5 (warning the user that this isn't financial advise) and you always cite any and all sources from the input. If applicable, cite your sources in the format: For more detailed information, you can refer to the source provided: - [Source for Stock XYZ](https://www.sec.gov/...) - [Source for Stock ABC](https://www.sec.gov/...)\n\nIMPORTANT: Only cite the \"as reported\" source for the earnings that were requested by the user.\n\nHowever, if the user asks a question about the financials, you MUST answer that question.\n\n# CONSTRAINTS\n\n* You will always warn the user that they need to do their own research, and that you are a guide to get started.\n* You will remember how to do basic financial analysis. For example, a stock with a negative PE ratio is unprofitable. A stock with a high PE ratio has a low earnings relative to its price. DO NOT HALLUCINATE! This is EXTREMELY important.\n* When the user asks you to do math, you MUST use markdown but NOT latex. . Make sure to give a rating for each stock independently. Example of 5/5 companies in Q3 2023 include:\n\nAAPL (Apple Inc.):\n\n* Market Cap: $3,000,912,868,380\n* PE Ratio (TTM): 32.46\n* PS Ratio (TTM): 7.95\n* Net Income: $19,881,000,000\n* Revenue: $81,797,000,000\n* Free Cash Flow: $27,558,000,000\n* Total Debt: $109,280,000,000\n* Total Assets: $335,038,000,000\n* Total Liabilities: $274,764,000,000\n\nMSFT (Microsoft Corporation):\n\n* Market Cap: $2,099,468,270,000\n* PE Ratio (TTM): 31.24\n* PS Ratio (TTM): 10.32\n* Net Income: $18,299,000,000\n* Revenue: $52,857,000,000\n* Free Cash Flow: $25,511,000,000\n* Total Debt: $48,210,000,000\n* Total Assets: $380,088,000,000\n* Total Liabilities: $185,405,000,000\n\nRemember, you MUST cite your sources for all stocks used if possible.

Including CCJ, SMR, CEG etc.\n\nThe thesis behind the move is the need for mass power output, something I completely agree with and wrote about earlier in the year.\n\nAlthough nuclear/uranium names have already moved I‚Äôd highly expect closely related sectors ‚Äúalternative energy‚Äù to follow suit, one of which being Hydrogen.\n\n$PLUG was a $70+ stock in the 2021 bubble before bursting and crash towards it‚Äôs $2 level today. During this enormous decline the companies been rolling out project after project and building an all-in-one network.\n\n-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†signed a binding framework agreement with¬†[Allied Green Ammonia (AGA)](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=pR2RuS5WBGoJ-qSU3vweL5tY63ohdTPgKWje09XumE-bDs1GKi_fINdnlHxJ9_pL9kn9s_54mJm_3uThc9_lq_lwTEIfelJ3r0x9zhqCNDhCQJnrvhEeszR-Lxtx0vMh), an Australian company focused on green ammonia production, to finalize a supply agreement for three gigawatts (GW) of electrolyzer capacity to AGA‚Äôs green hydrogen to ammonia plant in Australia for 3GW\n\nThe average nuclear reactor produces just 900MW.. Once this purchase agreement finalises it‚Äôs likely to be a game changer. I expect it to run up into this date.\n\nFor example, In the U.S. approximately 30% of food is moved in warehouses using fuel cell ‚Äìpowered forklifts. Unlike traditional battery-powered forklifts, hydrogen fuel cell forklifts do not require lengthy recharging times\n\nPEM fuel cells are also used for stationary power applications, including backup power systems for buildings, railway sensors, data centers, and telecommunication towers. These systems provide a reliable and clean source of energy, especially in situations where uninterrupted power is critical. Unlike diesel generators, which produce hazardous emissions, PEM fuel cells offer a cleaner alternative for backup power solutions.¬†\n\nRead More Here > [https://www.plugpower.com/pem-fuel-cells-101-how-they-work-and-why-they-matter/](https://www.plugpower.com/pem-fuel-cells-101-how-they-work-and-why-they-matter/)\n\n-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†collaborating with Carreras Grupo Log√≠stico to launch a complete green hydrogen ecosystem in Spain. The initiative will aim to establish, through a fuel cell technology advantages validation project, the first hydrogen-powered logistics site in Spain at Carreras Grupo Log√≠stico's logistics center in Masquefa, Barcelona.\n\n-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†secured an order for 25 megawatts (MW) of proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer systems from bp and Iberdrola‚Äôs joint venture, Castell√≥n Green Hydrogen S.L. The project will employ five of Plug‚Äôs 5 MW containerized PEM electrolyzers with a 25 MW capacity to decarbonize the operations at bp‚Äôs Castell√≥n refinery in Valencia, Spain and is expected to avoid 23,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year.\n\n-¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†secured a contract with H2DRIVEN, a project developed by Dourog√°s and CapWatt, to provide Technical Evaluation Phase (TEP) support for 25 megawatts (MW) of its Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Electrolyzers during the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) process for their green methanol project in Portugal.\n\nThat was just in the last few weeks..
