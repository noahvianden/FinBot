And that's pretty huge IMO, because honestly v11 seemed like it had really hit an upper limit of what they could do with hand coding every condition.  I would explain to my spouse sometimes (programmer humor) that whenever the car really was just doing something crazy, that it was \"all the thousands of IF...THEN...ELSE statements bumping into each other.\"\n\nIf v12 is as good as v11 on day #1, I honestly think it is encouraging long-term.  Although there will likely need to be regional trained networks built - you couldn't take this version Omar is driving around in SF and plop it in a car in the UK with its reverse drive and different looking signs, I suspect.  But the upside is that finding and training out intervention points should be much easier now.  Find a spot with frequent takeover interventions required, ask the fleet to find a bunch of non-FSD drives handling the same spot, review them for the best \"5-Star Uber driver\" clips, and then shove a couple hundred of them into the training library.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Good point about all of the code interfering with eachother on previous builds \n\nOptimistic about v12 although San Francisco is probably the most trained data set so it should be the best in that city", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah.  What seemed to be interesting off of the earnings call (I haven't listened to replay so just going off of others' notes) is that apparently Elon said it isn't doing as well with precipitation (which Omar has also noted) and so they are working to improve that before it goes out to a wide release, but there was not anything to indicate that the upcoming NA release would be geographically constrained in any way.  Like, it should do just as good in CA and CO and CT?  Rain or shine or snow?  That would be super exciting,\n\nHonestly, I'd take a NA-wide model that would disengage/refuse to engage in precipitation for now.  No problem, if the weather is shitty - yeah maybe I should be driving.  But when it's clear either day or night?  It would be great if Tesla could really get it to ok-to-look-away L3 levels of automation.  I'd prefer that over precipitation handling ... but I realize they're probably trying to deal with people who will try to turn it on for any type of road, anywhere.\n\nAnd then I start to think about really wild ideas in my head, like what if Tesla learns that they can have a neural net trained on 3-5 million clips of only dry weather (day or night) ... but it's actually better to have a separate neural net also trained on 3-5 million clips of only inclement weather to switch to.  That would not be entirely out of the realm of possibilities in my mind, as I try to ponder how one best trains a neural network.\n\nExciting times.

They just have to look at what happened, ask the fleet to collect a number of clips of non-FSD drives getting through there just fine (by going around the sign), pick the best ones in daytime / nighttime / rain / snow (?), and then add them into the neural net training library for the next time it compiles.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah I would assume that is how it works, but I have no knowledge of how you train an AI", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Why would you need different models for different regions?\n\n\nChatGPT can write in any language with just one model.

So clearly there will need to be region-specific training clips that are curated.  If you have that, why muddy up the network (and training/“compile” time) by making the UK neural network also understand driving in Beijing, São Paulo, Vietnam, etc.?  It wastes time and delivers no actionable value because cars are not “portable” like that.

With ChatGPT the model is large enough to simply handle everything.\n\n\nKeep in mind the models are huge and takes weeks, months to train. ChatGPT is 570GB in memory.

Therefore, combining both US and UK clip libraries into 2,000,000 artifacts ... does it take 4 weeks to train the network for that?  If so, then regional specific models might make more sense for faster iterations on a local level (again, given that cars don't really have \"portability\" requirements).\n\nIf not, then yeah - stuff them all in one.
