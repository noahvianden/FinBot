{"title": "Weekly Update #3", "selftext": "Hello Traders! Another successful week finishing at new all-time account highs. Weekly gain was just a bit under my target, but monthly P/L is on track to be near the goal of 3%. With the rally over the last few days, portfolio delta is back to being right where we want it. Theta % continues to be a challenge in the low VIX environment. Not a ton of trade action this week. Opened a new long term 112 position on /ES when the market took a dip early in the week. Also opened a 28 day /ES black swan hedge for around $112 that will payout $7500 if the market drops 10% in the next month.

Consists of a 50 point wide put debit spread at \\~25 delta along with 2 naked puts at 5 Delta. Sold for a credit, the debit spread provides a large bear trap for downside protection. Slightly delta positive. Naked puts are closed at \\~95% gain leaving the put debit spread as a free hedge.\n\nXL112: This is a long term 112 trade with a much larger trap. The put debit spread is usually about 250 to 300 points wide. Still sold for a credit. The main purpose is to provide a large amount of downside protection (maximum gain of over $15,000 if PDS is 300 points wide) while still collecting a small credit if the market continues higher.\n\n  \n\nThis is not financial advice and none of the trades shown are trade recommendations.

I’ve been modeling it out in optionstrat just to see a couple of different scenarios. What was your percent target for the PDS short? It looks like you’d have to wait until it’s at about 50% of its value to make roughly the same amount. Though, I would think by then, you would be at profit target for the two shorts and you could just close out those anyways and have a long put with infinite upside.\n\nEdit: Correction, you would have to sell the PDS short put at %25 of its value to be able to make %50 of the original profit target for this trade in addition to closing the 2x shorts at 5%. I’m not sure how valuable this really would be to do. I was modeling this out on a MES 112 that I have and in order to hit this goal you’d need a rather quick 140pt move up, the price to stay stable for about 30 days or 44 days if the price moves down 100 pts roughly. All of this I guess would be in the hopes that the stock then moves down further in whatever remaining days you have. Assuming scenario 2 where the price is somehow roughly stable for 30 days, you’d then need the price to move down like 80-100 pts just to make up the difference that you lose from buying back the PDS short at %25.
