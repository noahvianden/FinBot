I do use a solid ROI calc using the PE but accounting for a lower PE in the future (on cost, so your \"P\", price is locked in but your \"E\", EPS continues to grow), this means even if PE is high, a strongly growing EPS will flip that PE to a much more attractive ratio, in only a little time, ideally.
