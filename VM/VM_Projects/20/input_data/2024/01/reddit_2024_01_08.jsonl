This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).\n    \n- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.\n\n- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.\n\n- **Expiration:** 2024-01-12.\n\n- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are \"cheaper.\" High numbers mean options are \"expensive.\"\n\n- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option.

That is the legend/key to understanding this. If you are on mobile, realize you can likely scroll to the right to see the rest of the tables.   \n\n\nOk now the explanation.   \n\n\nLets say you are renting a car and the sales person offers you the \"extra insurance\" to protect yourself and the car from liability over the next 45 days.   \n\n\nHow likely are you to crash? What is your driving record? How expensive is the car you are renting?   \n\n\nAll those questions are used to determine the price of your risk. How much should the premium be so that the insuring company can win 95% of the time and lose 5% of the time (someone crashes) but the 95% of the wins more than pay for the 5% of the losses.   \n\n\nThe \"correct\" premium would be one that is slightly higher priced than the real risk - because that lets the insurance company make a little profit in exchange for them \"taking on your risk\" from you.   \n\n\nIf the premium is $2000 for 45 days its probably way too expensive. Don't buy that. Its great for the insurance company to sell it, but bad for you to buy it.   \n\n\nIf the premium is $20 for 45 days, its probably way too cheap. You should buy that insurance. Its a bad financial decision for the insurance company to sell you that.   \n\n\nWith that analogy you can see the \"price of future risk\" can be expensive or cheap.   \n\n\nYou want to sell expensive and buy cheap.   \n\n\nNow apply that to options trading.   \n\n\nIV - implied volatility - is the price of future risk over the next 45 days.   \nHV - historical volatility - is how risky things actually turned out to be over the previous 45 days.   \n\n\nComparing the two gives you some idea about the price of risk over the next 45 days - is it more expensive or cheaper than it \"should\" be?   \n\n\nKeep all that in mind, re-read the post, and then come back here with more questions!", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Omg I get it !!

{"title": "I was right about WIRE. I was right about ANF. I haven't been right about DQ.... yet.", "selftext": "I want to start this post noting that I am a value investor at heart and tend to stay away from options in favor of holding shares. I know that isn't the WSB way but value investments tend to be mis-priced for irrational periods of time and timing the market isn't my thing. With that being said, I come to you presenting 2 previous DD posts of mine which have gone somewhat overlooked and to pitch a previous idea of mine of which I am still holding.\n\n**My previous DD posts consisted of:**\n\n[Encore Wire on 2/18/22, up 97% as of posting](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/svj098/encore_wire_wire_is_an_undervalued_and_relatively/)\n\n[Abercrombie & Fitch on 1/11/22, up 175% as of posting](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s13gm5/abercrombie_finch_anf_is_cool_again_and_the_stock/)\n\nBoth of these ideas at their core consisted of buying well-run companies at low valuations/downturns (price to FCF, manageable/low debt), high **cash** on balance sheet, seemingly unanimous negative sentiment, all while management were engaged in some form of buybacks/shareholder returns. \n\n**This brings me to my latest idea that consists of these same principles which has not worked out... yet.**\n\n[DQ on 9/15/22, down -60% as of posting.](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xeovn2/dq_a_question_of_morals_value/) \n\nThankfully, I opted to [buy shares instead of selling puts in my original post. I currently hold an average postion of $39.21/share as I have been averaging down.](https://imgur.com/a/ZOC8Kxz) I thought DQ was a great purchase back then, and I'm here to explain why even after a 60% downturn it is an even **better buy now.** This post is going to serve as a \"part 2\" to my previous post on DQ, so I'd recommend reading that first and coming back to this.\n\nMy previous post laid out that DQ is hoarding a ton of cash as a [result of the run up in polysilicon prices in late 2022.](https://imgur.com/a/1TimFTp) DQ also holds $0 in debt, making it completely liquid. The story mostly revolved around the dynamic that most other commodities experienced due to COVID and lenient financial policy. Now obviously the price of polysilicon has come down to earth and down to a level that only keeps the lowest cost producers profitable. This is both a blessing and a curse to DQ and it’s important to see both sides.\n\nOne of the pros is that DQ IS [one of the lowest cost producers, producing poly at a price of $6.52/kg.](https://imgur.com/a/4EeNnR6) The price of poly is expected to hover around current lows which stand around $8/kg. The question of *for how long* is something I unfortunately could not exactly tell you. Could it go lower? Perhaps, but with the amount of over-investment already made in the space chasing the COVID highs my gut says: no. There *are* still companies who have pledged more investment in production capacity, but for the most part I believe that we are past the point of further glut. These other companies also have to deal with debt repayment/servicing, something DQ does not have to worry about. This will keep the company afloat and even profitable at the bottom of the cycle until a future catalyst emerges. **It is best to buy cyclical stocks with good balance sheets at the bottom of the cycle and wait.** \n\nAnother pro for DQ is that they are going to buyback a lot of shares. First off, 2023 included a $750m buyback program, which will be reflected in the upcoming annual report. 2024 will also include a potentially massive buyback or some other form of shareholder returns and **THIS** is why. [This is 688303, the Asia listing for DQ’s subsidiary company of which they own around 72.4% of.](https://imgur.com/a/ZS9Dmc1) If you look towards the bottom right of the image you will see that they are current listed at a $61B CNY market cap, (EDIT: which is $8B USD), a crazy divergence from the DQ ADR listed here in the US. They also pay out massive dividends, most of which goes to the US listed DQ. Now you can think that this is a Chinese *cook the books* kind of situation ala Luck’n, but the demand for polysilicon & price paid seems to prove legitimate IMO. But what does this have to do with DQ buying back shares? Well, on the latest earnings call management alluded to a potential plan involving 688303. [Management could consider selling up to 10% of the Asia listing in July and use the funds to buyback the US listed stock.](https://imgur.com/a/vtSB21x) I don’t know what the market cap of 688303 will be come July, but even at half the current listing they could raise around $400M which should be returned to shareholders.\n\nLast pro for DQ is the new theme surrounding poly prices in 2024. When people refer to poly prices, they usually refer to P-type polysilicon. This has been the industry standard for solar for sometime. However, recent developments have led to the refinement of a more efficient and effective type of polysilicon called N-type polysilicon. The new theme of 2024 will be [the divergence in price between these 2 types.](https://imgur.com/a/IMSX9UU) But why does this matter? Because DQ has the capability to produce this higher quality N-type which could command future price premiums compared to P-type. It isn’t totally clear how much of their current capacity can be N-type, but I believe the annual report will give more color into that. This could be an advantage to drive slightly more profitability if the demand for N-type takes off. \n\nNow, the cons. Sentiment sentiment sentiment. China bad. China bubble. China China China. Nobody wants anything to do with anything Chinese, and I understand that and understand why. China is notoriously known for accounting fraud and illegitimate operations and bailing out with investor money. This is why I feel I have to post this in WSB and not somewhere like ValueInvesting. It is a calculated risk. If you don’t like it, don’t listen to me it is your choice. I want to repeat that one more time. **If you don’t like it, don’t listen to me it is your choice.** \n\nAnother con is that DQ potentially spends their cash and continues to invest the money in capacity. I’m led to believe that current management is prudent with their capital and recognizes where we are in the cycle and will stay the course. However, there are *some* cracks showing. DQ’s subsidiary recently [announced a project that will cost around $1b in a measure to reduce production cost/kg.](https://imgur.com/a/ElqTOzn) I don’t necessarily see the move itself as a con, but it shows that management isn’t yet shy to spend on CAPEX. As a shareholder I need to see shareholder returns, especially at such a cheap price. But time will tell.\n\n**TL:DR:** I’ll use this last part of the post to try to tie everything I’ve said into a small sweet package. DQ has $3.3B in cash and $0 debt. It is currently trading at only a $1.77B market cap. Polysilicon is at the bottom of the cycle, yet DQ will STILL squeak out profit.

Many times, interstate truck stops were closed, and I had to go off path for a fill up - thank goodness my Prius takes 5 mins to fill up and go, plus gets 50 mpg, not limited to electric chargers, which btw I saw almost no where.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The navigation plots your path as well as tell you how many open chargers are available before you get there.  Some you can skip, some you cannot, but I have had to wait for a charger maybe twice over all my time.  You know before you leave how long you will charge at each stop before you leave.  Some are 15min most are 20min very rarely is it more than that.  3-4hrs drive, I need that, its fine.  I would not take a gas driven Rolls or Bentley on a long trip after owning a Tesla.  That is how good the experience is.  I know that is not the case with other EVs not using the Tesla charging network.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}
