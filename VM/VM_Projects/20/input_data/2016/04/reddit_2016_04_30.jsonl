The advantage is that CEOs of companies like [recently acquired] Precision Castparts Corp can now focus 100% on how to improve their competitive advantage rather than wasting time preparing 10-K or raising capital from creditors\" \n\nQ: why you anti rooftop solar in Nevada! \nA: we don't like how the 1% who can afford solar panels get subsidized with 3x the grid price from the 99% who can't afford rooftop solar. Ultimate the public utility commissions make the rules but we agree with this specific decision. \n\nQ: will you be continuing to buy back stocks at 1.2x the book value? \nA: not 100% guaranteed, but basically yes, and in very high volumes. Buy back is an investment just like buying companies. The intrinsic value is higher than the book value; if market value falls below 1.2x the book then it would be a good investment; and we keep a close eye on that. It also serves as a way to protect our market value against any hostile purchase at a discount; but this wouldn't happen given our market cap. Another reason is that this act provides additional value for our shareholders because we don't pay out dividend; investing $1 in our company will almost guarantee $1.20 return. We won't increase this to 1.3x unless we run out of ideas to use cash. ", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I just love that they're the only company that cares about the timing of their buyback.
