{"title": "r/StockMarket Weekly Stock Picking Challenge for the Week of (10/17 - 10/21) is now OPEN for picks! *RATIONALE REQUIRED!*", "selftext": "# Welcome to the r/StockMarket Weekly Stock Picking Challenge for the Week of (10/17 - 10/21)\n\n**PLEASE READ THESE RULES THOROUGHLY BEFORE POSTING UP YOUR PICKS!**\n\n# SEE RECENT RULE CHANGE #7 AT THE BOTTOM -- RATIONALE NOW A REQUIREMENT!!!\n\n**If you want to be eligible to participate in this week's contest here is what you need to do (REQUIRED!):**\n> * 1.) Post 2 tickers (ex. AAPL = Apple) but **YOU MUST** pick 2 not just 1 or else I will not add you to our list of contestants!\n> * 2.) Choose either Long or Short for each ticker (Obviously LONG - if you think it will go up ... or SHORT - if you think it will go down this week...)\n> * 3.) Both of your picks **MUST** each be at least $2 at the very minimum!\n\n**Contest Rules (READ THESE AND FOLLOW THEM!)**:\n> * 1.) No OTC or Foreign companies.\n> * 2.) No Options, Futures, Forex, stuff like that... Equities ONLY that trade on the U.S. Stock Exchange!\n> * 3.) If you don't post both the ticker AND the direction (LONG/SHORT) you won't be added to the list of contestants for this week's stock picking challenge!\n> * 4.) You cannot duplicate someone's exact play! For example- If someone picks AAPL - Long and BAC - Long first then you can only pick AAPL - Short and BAC - Long or AAPL - Long and BAC - Short *<-- you may only duplicate 1 pick but not BOTH!* This is a first come, first serve basis here.\n> * 5.) Picks absolutely **MUST** be posted in here before the 9:30AM eastern cash market open on Monday morning!\n> * 6.) You are only allowed 1 leveraged ETF. If you choose two, the second of the two does not count and is still up for grabs. If incorrect picks go un-noticed, you risk your position being forfeited! (These are the 2x/3x ETF's)\n> * 7.) RATIONALE - You **MUST** post up a rationale (either technical or fundamental) for both of your picks or you will **NOT** be entered into this week's contest!\n> * 8.) Please **DO NOT EDIT** your picks!! If you absolutely must choose another pick, please use a separate post and state that you are changing your original pick to something else!\n\nI will post up the live contest spreadsheet a little after the market closes on Monday with everyone's picks posted, this will include your opening prices, current prices, P&L, & Total ROI for each of your picks, as well as an overall total ROI and an overall average ROI between 2 of your picks, and that will be what we will use to total up both of your 2 picks!\n\nIn addition, since we're doing this contest on Reddit, no one will be able to close out their picks during the trading week... Everyone's picks will close at Friday's close! And also everyone's picks will start at Monday's opening prices.\n\nGood luck to everyone in here! Let's see who can deliver the 2 best picks for this week and take bragging rights as the best stock picker of the week here at r/StockMarket! :)\n\nIf you have any questions about anything feel free to fire away on this thread...\n\nAlso, for anyone looking around for our past weekly contest threads & results here they are!:\n\n* **[r/StockMarket Stock Picking Challenge for the week of (8/29 - 9/2)](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/500y92/rstockmarket_stock_picking_challenge_for_the_week/)**\n\n* **[Congratulations to this week's r/StockMarket Stock Picking Contest WINNER -- bigbear0083!
