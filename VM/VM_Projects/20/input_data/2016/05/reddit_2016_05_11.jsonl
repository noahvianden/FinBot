The reason it sucks is because the bid/ask spread is so wide so on a percentage  basis you are getting fucked when you buy, and again when you sale. Basically you are garuenteed to lose due to illquidity(terrible spread and volume). Lets look at the Jan 2018 18 strike. It has a 2.40 bid and a 3.00 ask this is about a 20 percent difference so at best you can buy it taking a 10 percent hit (if you get filled on the mid) but as options move away from the money they lose even more illquidity and you could take an even bigger hit when you are taking profits and you will have to pay up big if you want to close out to prevent a loss. So at a minimum, illquidity is costing you 25 percent. Plus you have broker fees. Therefore trading this ETF is worse than buying scratch offs. If you do something more liquid like the SPY you have a way higher chance of success. Also, I'd  suggest you learn about the option Greeks, mostly delta, theta, and Vega to help you understand your risks associated with a certain strike price or option date.
