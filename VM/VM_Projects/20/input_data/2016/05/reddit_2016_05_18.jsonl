Match's parent company is basically a portfolio of many new media/internet brands and offers a nice dividend. (http://iac.com/brand/match-group). Apple is fine if you do not expect the growth of years past.\n\nMGT? Running on news. McAfee is an intelligent guy (although he is kind of technology's Colonel Kurtz), but there is a point even with news like that where the buying momentum will weaken, then turn and the pullback will make people's heads spin.\n\nOther things: Danaher (one of the best performing stocks of the last few decades; while past performance is not likely to be replicated, this is still a terrific industrial/life sciences company that will split into two companies in June; optimally, a better entry would be in the low $90's, DHR).\n\nConstellation Brands (Highly successful wine/beer biz, powered by Corona/Modelo, as well as more recent purchases like Ballast Point. Considering an IPO of its Canadian business. STZ. Not a fundamentally cheap stock at all, but doing exceedingly well and making all the right moves while other major players in the industry are having mixed results.) Small, but growing dividend.\n\nAmgen (AMGN). One of the largest biotechs, a somewhat more consistent/stable stock than most in the volatile sector. Growing dividend. Gilead (GILD) is a tremendously cheap biotech (especially if it gets in the upper $70's/lower $80's.), but the situation with Gilead is that - sort of similar to Apple - the market does not have clarity on where the company is going next beyond their successful HepC drugs. You may have to have real patience, but cheap stock and good dividend in the meantime.\n\nRailroads: Canadian National (CNI), Union Pacific (UNP), Canadian Pacific (CP) or BNSF (via Berkshire Hathaway). Wide moat companies with tremendous assets. The replacement value of railroads is astronomical. They will continue to be around for many years, hauling grain, oil and other assets.\n\nData Center/Cell Tower REITs: QTS, COR, CONE, DLR, EQIX (data centers) and CCI/AMT (cell towers; CCI us-centric, AMT global). Own information infrastructure plus income. I'd recommend waiting for a pullback, but this (moreso the data centers than cell towers) is a nice way to take advantage of a growth story and get a pretty decent yield.\n\nVisa (V): Only continues to grow in scale after taking Costco from Amex. Beautiful business of essentially being a toll road for money. No credit risk, just a pure toll road. \n\nIn terms of broker, either:\n\n1. Robinhood. No commission, but very limited features (no ability to automatically reinvest dividends, no analyst reports, etc etc.) I'm not sure you can move assets from RH to another broker unless they updated that.\n\n2. Full brokerage. Commission (varies by broker), full features (analyst reports, dividend reinvestment, etc etc.)\n\nMore information in the wiki: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index\n", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "> It's just weird and I have a feeling\n\nThis is not the way to pick successful investments.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Absolutely.

Pay off of dividends or just the price of the stock gradually increasing over time? ", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Both, but it varies in what you are looking for. For dividends, I usually look for a company that pays out dividends and has a good history of a gradual increase, OR, something that ranges between say x price and y price over the course of z years and try to buy at the low of that stock. \n\nExample would be PEP(Pepsico) or GE(General Electric) they dont have a ton of growth over 5 years but pay dividends, grab the low of the stock and hop on and hold. The point of grabbing it low is to compensate for possible draw down in the future(Short term) but in long term growth it could just be a matter of a few %.\n\n\nIn the case of a ranging dividend stock, its a relatively safer option, the P&L doesn't matter too much in its growth because you are looking for the dividend payouts. I cant find the company I am thinking of at this moment, but there was a stock that over the past 5 years paid out about 3% and ranged between 2-3$ (like 27-30) at all times. I consider that a safe dividend stock, especially if you buy it at its low point in that cycle. \n\nIn longterm growth companies, dividends are less important but not irrelivant, primarily you are looking for overall % growth over time. Typically you should look for growth over years, not months. 1-10 years of holding would, in the case of a good pick would produce a significant gain.\n\nI'm sorry if my responses are shit, my head is all over the place and my responses come out super confusing and all over the place. Let me know if I need to clarify something. \n\nEdit: If you are looking at investing as a way to make your money grow with inflation as opposed to that .01% interest your bank gives you, mix your money between longterm/short term growth and dividends. I am trading with other peoples money (fathers IRA) so I am aiming for 3% dividends per year and another 4-12% in realized P&L. Actually I'm aiming to end positive per year.
