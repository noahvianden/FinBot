For me, I was only able to get a feel of trading when I started investing my own money in the market. I feel that's when you will really understand your risk appetite. But ultimately, getting a feel is important. :)\n\n2. When I started, I had a list of strong companies. Basically these are the companies that constantly do well, you hear good things about them. They are said to have strong fundamentals. These strong companies, I kept for a long term because I knew that even if they go down, I know that they will never crash. Since I had regular cash flow, I had the ability to buy them on dips, even if I had them before. \n\nHow did I know the companies with strong fundamentals? You've to do your research. Find out what experts say about it. See if they've given good results yearly. \n\n3. Finally, getting into a stock is always a lucky call. Its very rare that you catch it when it has bottomed out. I usually just accumulate small amounts as the price keeps going down. \n\nSometimes I follow advice given by traders on what could be the entry level for a stock. \n\nRecently, ive been learning to read charts. Nothing fancy mind you. I just try to look for the way the stock has behaved over the year. Usually it has an up and down pattern with a support and resistance level. I try to buy it if I am sure the stock is at the support level. Of course, even this is just an guestimate.

This brings the average price you've paid for all your shares down.\n\nI'm noob as hell, and also down 7% this year, so I'll refrain from pretending to have advice. The tactic you are describing is averaging down, knowing the term can hopefully help you search for more relevant advice.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Averaging down also increases risk as the position size increases. So if you have 100 shares, you can bring your average cost down on a price drop by adding another 100 shares.

Im glad you are trying to make your money work for you.  Let me help.\n\nStep 1) Set reasonable expectations.  Trading single stocks like you are doing is exceptionally risky and should only be done on a long term basis.  I bought AAPL in 2005 and wanted to take advantage of the swings in price.  I ended up selling for a 400% gain in 2009(ish) in order to pick up more on a dip.  Problem is that it never dipped to below my selling price again.  I turned $5k into $20k by holding.  That would be worth $100k now if I hadn't tried to be clever.\nSo sit down and plan out what your financial goals are, then study like fucking mad.  Figure out what kind of financial tools are available to you and how they work.  Then start using the right ones to accomplish your goals.\n\nWhat Im trying to say here is that step 1 to crossing a lake isnt jumping in the lake.  That is how you drown.  You need to learn to swim or build a yacht or something first.  So go figure out how you are going to get across the lake, before you jump in, and then give it a shot.\n\n Step 2)  \n>I know Apple, Twitter, and GoPro are going to eventually ascend again.\n\nNo you dont.  No one knows.  The professional traders dont even know.  The difference is that the professionals know that they dont know and construct a trading plan around that uncertainty.  \n\n\nIf you bought in the last 6 months, you bought at the absolute peak of the market.  You probably read some news or some shit about the S&P potentially pushing all-time highs or AAPL being the most valuable company to ever exist, etc and bought the hype.  That was the wrong thing to do. \n\n\n\n\nStep 3) I see you are being told to not trade with emotion.  Well, there are three types of traders:\n\n* Those that trade with emotoin and learn to manage it\n\n* Those that trade with emotion and lie to themseves about it by justifying it with technical analysis or some other confirmation bias BS (which is what EVERYONE on this sub does)\n\n* Professionals that actually know what they are doing. AKA successful hedge fund guys and people writing the bots (which is bulk of market trading activity BTW)\n\nRealistically, you dont have time to become a professional.  So you can either recognize that you trade with emotion and manage it, or you can lie to yourself.  Its up to you.\n\n\nMy advise would be to dump everything but facebook right the fuck now and I would seriously consider selling FB too.  FB is the only one that has made you money, but that is luck, not prudence.  If you want to keep it, fine, but set an exit goal (like +15% or something) and sell when it get to that point no matter what.  \n\nBut yeah, If I were you, I would take my losses at 7% and go study.  Write down your financial goals, make a plan that doesnt involve asking strangers on the internet noob questions like this, and bring your $900 back into play when you are knowledgeable enough to prudently acquire assets that meet your goals.\n\nAlso, get off robinhood.
