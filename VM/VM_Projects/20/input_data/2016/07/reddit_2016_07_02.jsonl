{"title": "disturbing macro similarity to current conditions", "selftext": "In late 1985 and early 1986, the United States economy began shifting from a rapidly growing recovery from the early 1980s recession to a slower growing expansion, which resulted in a brief \"soft landing\" period as the economy slowed and inflation dropped. The stock market advanced significantly, with the Dow peaking in August 1987 at 2,722 points, or 44% over the previous year's closing of 1,895 points. Further financial uncertainty may have resulted from the collapse of OPEC in early 1986, which led to crude oil price decreasing by more than 50% by mid-1986.[2]\n\nOn October 14, the DJIA dropped 95.46 points (3.8%) (a then record) to 2,412.70, and fell another 58 points (2.4%) the next day, down over 12% from the August 25 all-time high.\n\nOn Thursday, October 15, 1987, Iran hit the American-owned (and Liberian-flagged) supertanker, the Sungari, with a Silkworm missile off Kuwait's main Mina Al Ahmadi oil port. The next morning, Iran hit another ship, the U.S.-flagged MV Sea Isle City, with another Silkworm missile.\n\nOn Friday, October 16, when all the markets in London were unexpectedly closed due to the Great Storm of 1987, the DJIA fell 108.35 points (4.6%) to close at 2,246.74 on record volume. Then-Treasury Secretary James Baker stated concerns about the falling prices.\n\nThe crash began in Far Eastern markets the morning of October 19. Later that morning, two U.S. warships shelled an Iranian oil platform in the Persian Gulf in response to Iran's Silkworm missile attack on the Sea Isle City.[3][4]...\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_(1987)\n\n===========================================\n\nI see two big down days i'm runnin'", "id": "4qy40v", "created_utc": 1467480151.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "when everyone is planning for a crash...the premium sellers win", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "There were 2 big down days a week ago\n\nEveryone wants to be a star in the next Big Short.........\n\ne: interesting post tho none the less", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "i don't....\n\ni am making money nicely right now.
