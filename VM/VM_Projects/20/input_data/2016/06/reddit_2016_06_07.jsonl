In addition, I'd imagine there is a significant overlap between the platforms which would suggest an acquisition would do little to generate DAU's/MAU's. I'm sure these numbers are included in the valuation of LinkedIn which means Facebook would basically be paying for users that are already on it's platform.\n\nAs for Microsoft, it's just not their business.
