If you are new to options do NOT \"sell to open\" a position. Indeed, most brokerages won't allow you do do this unless you lied (more than usual) to them. Naked calls require somebody who REALLY knows what they are doing. \n\nJust \"buy to open\" and \"sell to close.\" Calls for upward movement and puts to short. \n\nTo your question, a put gives you the option to sell a contract (100 shares) at a strike price on or before expiration. You pocket the premium that has resulted from the downward movement. For example, your put strike is $20, and the stock falls from $25 to $15 a share. You then have the option to buy it for $15 and sell it at $20. Of course, few are doing that, you are just selling making money from premiums. \n\nWhen you bought that put with a $20 strike, the price may have been $0.30 (x100 shares). When the stock drops below $20 and is in the money, the puts may be trading at $0.50 (x100). Congrats, you made $0.20 or $20 total for your 1 contract. \n\nSure, fees will crush you on that...but that's why you buy 20 or 30 or 100+ contracts.
