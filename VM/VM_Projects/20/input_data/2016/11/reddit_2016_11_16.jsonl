The space is conservatively estimated to be worth 2-3x OCUL's current market cap (150m). Many have it much higher than this.\n\nAdditionally, Regeneron, a pharmaceutical giant in the ophthalmology space, recently entered into a deal with Ocular Therapeutix for the use of their platform. Upon reaching certain milestones with the clinical testing of Regeneron's drug, Ocular Therapeutix may receive two payments of 150m (one for each milestone). This, in addition to the 10m up front payment, would total 310m in cash for Ocular Therapeutix as well as royalties on Regeneron's drug once it makes it to market.\n\nThe recent political climate has caused a shift in the economic sectors, with biotech being the largest benefactor. The Trump administration plans on reducing the stringency of the requirements to gain FDA approval, something this drug had already nearly achieved.
