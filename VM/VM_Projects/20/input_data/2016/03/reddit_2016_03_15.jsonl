Enjoy your ~$112. However, if the stock goes beneath 210 (let's say to 200), you run a high risk of being assigned, which means you're obligated to buy 100 shares at the price of 210, or *$21,000*. On top of having to pony up all that cash, you now own 100 shares of a $200 stock which would normally cost $20,000 in total, but you paid $1,000 more for it, so you'd better damn well hope TSLA goes back up so you can recoup. And that's just if it goes to 200.\n\nYou do get to keep that ~$112 though, so at least you've got that going for you.\n\n\n***Scenario 2: Sell TSLA 210/207.5 Credit Spread (Sell 210 Put, Buy 207.5 Put)***\n\nMax Potential Gain: ~$38\n\nMax Potential Loss: $212\n\nAs with Scenario 1, if the stock stays above 210, you're good. Enjoy your ~$38. If it goes below 210 (again to 200), you run the risk of being assigned. *HOWEVER*, you bought a Put that says you're allowed to sell 100 shares at 207.5, so even though you'd be obligated to spend $21,000 to buy 100 shares at 210 like before, your 207.5 Put allows you to turn around and sell them at 207.5 a piece for a total of $20,750, a net loss of $250. In other words, The 207.5 Put you bought acted as your safety net, limiting your potential risk to the difference between the two strikes prices (210 - 207.5 = 2.50) multiplied by the number of shares (100 per contract), which, to answer your first question, is where I got the number $250 from.\n\nSure, you're not making that sweet ~$112 from Scenario 1, but you're also not risking a ton of money that your noob ass probably doesn't have.\n\nIt's also worth noting that some people sell Naked Puts on a stock that they'd like to own long term. If the stock stays above their strike, they keep a bit of money, but if it goes down, they get assigned and buy it at a cheaper price. Again, this only works if you're bearish on the stock long-term and you believe that it will go back up.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "was I right or was I right", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You should buy VRX 50.00 puts at .18, said yesterday.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "How can I get in touch with this yesterday?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Find doc brown ", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "You should never sell naked puts, on anything, ever, ever, ever.
