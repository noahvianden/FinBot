Every single year it has been \"any day now, the whole market will go down!\" They usually predict more than recessions actually. Most of them insist an economic collapse is coming.\n\nI call these people doom porn peddlers. Because they and the people who believe in them get off on the idea they are smarter than the market and just 'know' that a collapse is imminent. They have been 100% wrong, and anyone listening to them has lost a lot of money. That doesn't mean the market won't go down. The market is cyclical. Recessions happen, and one will happen again in the future. But no one knows if it will be next month, next year, or five years from now. Trying to time the market based on doom porn peddlers is a recipe for losing money.\n\nThe problem with \"waiting for a downturn\" is when do you know the downturn is over? Do you invest a -5%, -10%, -30%? It is trying to catch a falling knife, and in most cases when you do that you lose because the market goes down further than you think it will.

You spread your timing risk that way.\n\nI'm sitting on cash and looking to liquidate significantly soon (at significant risk) on the notion that Dec's rate hike risk is all downside, meaning the market could drop, but not likely to rise, so I'll step out and into cash for a spell and hope my bets are right.

It always goes down and it always goes up again. The problem is that you can't possibly know when these things will happen. But it is safest to buy after a correction than after a bull market. You have to use patience. And you can never know if it will continue to fall after you have bought. So the safest way to buy is in small increments. That way your average buy price is quite low. But you also won't have all of your money invested, because you won't know the bottom and therefore won't be totally invested at the bottom.

As long as the dollar is the global reserve, the worst that's going to happen is that the Fed prints so much money to bail out the world that the US dollar is at risk of devaluation / inflation. If this happens, stocks are an asset class that intrinsically rises with inflation, as profits in devalued dollars translate to higher EPS. Still gotta watch out for shitty sectors though. If you are going semi mad max and want to protect your neck, look for cash flow investments that have the best chance to weather economic storms and which own inflation hedges like real estate.
