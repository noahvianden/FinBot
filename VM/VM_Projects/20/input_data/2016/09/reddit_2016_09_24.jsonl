This sub has been the most helpful resource along with option alpha and investopedia. I know that the way to win in this game is to use spreads and a lot of delta neutral strategies. I may be sounding really stupid right now, but I'm confused: can i make trades on indices like SPY? Am I mistaken in thinking I can't be \"naked\" on these since there aren't shares to liquidate? I would really like to start using iron condors or credit spreads on the SPY, UVXY, etc. \n\nPlease let me know if I'm on the right track and maybe if its possible with my capital amount? Or if I'm mistaken on anything and need correcting. Feel free to make any recommendations in general.
