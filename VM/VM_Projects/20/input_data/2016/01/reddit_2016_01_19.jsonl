Both straddles will be affected.   But the impact will be greater on the back month because of the higher vega (i.e. the impact of IV on the price of an option)\n\nSo what I was suggesting is that becuase of the months you picked, Feb will drop b/c of IV going down tomorrow.  But if you hold the March, IV will possibly go back up leading into earnings for April.  But it may be too far out for you to recover.  You still have Theta (or time decay) to consider and that will impact the back month as well.\n\nGenerally you want to do a calendar spread when IV is expected to rise.  The trade is short delta, long vega.\n\nEDIT: Actually, if you wanted to do this trade, you do it tomorrow after the IV crush.  Then you'll get the benefit of the larger theta decay on Feb, and a potential rise in IV in the next month or so.\n\n", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "thanks I think I understand now.\nWould it have made a difference if I was short straddle Jan 22 and Long straddle on the following week?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Not really.
