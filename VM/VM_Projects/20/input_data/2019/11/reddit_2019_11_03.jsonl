I don‚Äôt maintain a predictive spreadsheet, but I can easily picture them having $10-11 billion quarterly revenue by Q4 2020. \n\nAssuming everything else holds exactly equal to where they are now (in other words, controlling for all other variables), how would such a change in revenue influence the current stock price range? Would the price:sales ratio be expected to be maintained (leading to a much higher price range for the stock) or as a priced-in growth stock is the expected revenue growth be assumed and the price:sales ratio would shift?", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "The consensus estimates for next year are $29.7 billion of revenue and $4.61 (up from ~$4.10 three weeks ago) of EPS. If they beat those numbers, in general, the stock should do well. \n\nAs for my estimates, I am expecting ~ $9 of EPS and ~$34.6b of revenue. I get to those numbers using 60,000 MS/X, 350,000 M3s, and 100,000 MYs and 18.89% overall gross margins before FSD. I also assume a 40% growth rate for Energy to $2.1 billion of revenue in 2020. Between energy and service, I assume 0% gross margin.\n\nThe big things that could lead Tesla to beat my numbers would be (1) selling any significant number of Semis, (2) MS/X sales surprising to the upside after Plaid refresh, (3) energy sales growing more like 100% with positive margins thanks to solar roof, megapacks, etc., (4) auto margins continue to improve. I'm sure many other curveballs could come our way. I'm sure I'll end up being off by a lot on a lot of my assumptions. \n\nFor Q4 2020 I really have no idea but I could see 150,000 M3/Y and 20,000 MS/X assuming a plaid refresh. With ASPs of 60,000 and 95,000 respectively, that would be nearly $11 billion alone. Add in service and energy and it could be a $13 billion+ quarter.

I like to think of stock prices as a Ouija board.

I think Q3 did a little to move in that direction, but the next year is going to do a lot more.  Here are some things that have always been true about Tesla that could change in the next year:\n\n1. Tesla revenue has a compound annual growth rate of 80% per year for the last 9 years.\n2. They've never had 4 quarters of profit.\n3. Their balance sheet and debt have always been a significant concern.\n\nTesla's 'normal' revenue growth would be more than enough to set an all-time record for most companies, but I think 2020 could be even better.

If that happens, I think a lot of people are going to re-evaluate the company.\n\nIf Tesla can actually pull of 4 consecutive quarters of profit, or if their profits actually start to stabilize and grow, a lot of people will re-evaluate the company.  Also there's the perpetual talk of S&P inclusion which would actually *require* a lot of investors to buy the stock.\n\nIf Tesla really can continue to hold their cash position fairly stable without short-changing capex or R&D, well, I don't think anyone will really change their minds on the stock from this alone, but it will certainly eliminate one more reason not to invest.\n\nIf somehow next year winds up being both the first full year of profitability and a significant outlier in terms of growth, I think we could easily see the stock hit new highs.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think a part of the future growth is somewhat priced in already, but not entirely.
