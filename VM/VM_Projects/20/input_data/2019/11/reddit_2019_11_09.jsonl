When it’s at its lowest level, would it be a good idea to buy a LEAP Call in VXX hoping that market would pullback sometime?", "id": "dtq7ol", "created_utc": 1573267831.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "In general, VXX is designed to constantly lose value.  \n\nIt's not a bad idea to buy long calls; you just need to be aware that the underlying shares in general (except spikes upward in the VIX) are designed to lose value. \n\nTheir process is to maintain a constant-aged portfolio of VX monthly futures. Each day the fund sells a fraction of futures that are nearer expiration, that usually has less value than the 60 to 45 day out futures purchased. This price skew is called \"contango\" in the futures world. \n\nEventually, in the next year or two, it will have a reverse split to push the share price back up. UVXY does the same thing, and had a reverse split in the last year I believe. (The present VXX is an entirely new fund; the original VXX  expired early this year, and a new nearly identical fund was  established a year earlier to replace it, and its different ticker, VXXB, was changed to VXX after a few  this spring 2019.) \n\nKnowing that VXX is always generally declining, the strategy is to finance the decline, typically the move is to sell put credit spreads safely below the money on a two to four week basis, financing longer term single long calls, or long vertical call debit spreads, waiting for intermediate spikes upwards of the VIX and VXX. \n\nRight now, with the VIX at 12.xx, is a good time to contemplate buying VXX calls with a 60 to 90 day term.  If VIX goes to 11.xx or lower, this is an even better time to buy VXX.  \n\nOr you could buy large butterflies or calendars on SPY waiting for moderate or larger swings down, effectively getting similar results as owning a long VXX call. \n\n(As of Nov 8 2019 close)     \nFor example a calendar, a pair of calendars at December 20 2019 / January 17    2020, centered at   \n300 for 1.57, or  \n290 for 1.21, or  \n285, for 1.03.   \n\nOr a larger butterfly, for example    \n305 - 280 - 255    \nexpiring Jan 17 2020, now priced at 2.84, more or less,   \n or Feb 21 2020, priced at 2.95", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "So basically you’re putting a bullish bet via put credit spread and call debit spread. \n\nI had a Put credit spread 21/19 when the market was at its all time highs last month lol.

As usual I am going to start with the large caps before moving on to smaller companies and have tried to categorize them as much as possible for those who prefer to dip in and out. \n\nThe week kicked off on Monday with the rebranding of **Facebook** as FACEBOOK which was seen by some as an attempt to distinguish the app from the company and by others (of a more cynical nature) as an attempt to deflect attention during a time of regulatory scrutiny. However, if that was the case, Facebook need not have bothered as plenty of distraction was caused by the termination of **McDonald’s** CEO position for a romantic encounter with a subordinate and the announcement by **Under Armour** that their accounting practices were under investigation by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nElsewhere, **Xerox** launched a bold bid to acquire HP Inc, a company three times its size, for $22 (a premium of 37% above where the stock traded a month ago) split 77% cash and 23% stock in a transaction that would still leave HPQ shareholders in control of 48% of the company. Xerox has identified potential synergies totalling $2 billion, a meaningful amount for a group with a combined market capitalisation of $36.3 billion.  However, synergies often fail to materialise and with both entities facing secular decline it seems like a mistake, to put it mildly, to propose a $28 billion cash payment that will be funded primarily by debt.\n\nOn Monday **Ferrari** saw its stock jump 6% after reporting a strong beat and raise along with announcing a planned collaboration with Armani. It is an attempt to transform Ferrari into a fully fledged luxury brand and away from the sun glasses and polo tops that are currently diluting its top end aspirations. Easier said than done.  The stock later gave back most of Monday’s gains but finished the week still trading on an earnings multiple of 37. That’s a big premium for an auto company even if consensus forecasts point to 15% annual growth. \n\n**Square** jumped 5% on Thursday after reporting strong Q3 sales growth of 43% and a 42% increase in gross profits. The stock is still down 35% from its 2018 peak due to concerns about a lack of profitability and increasing competition. Nevertheless investors were cheered by Wednesday’s print.  \n\nSquare’s stock had  dropped in August after guidance for adjusted revenue fell short of analyst expectations of $599 million. Q3’s result did beat those with adjusted revenue of $602 million and shows that Square continues to grow revenue at an impressive rate in a total addressable market that is estimated (in the US alone) at almost 30x current GPV/revenues.  Additionally Square has yet to enter significant markets abroad. There are over 125 million businesses around the world that can potentially use Square’s services, so the company's growth has the potential to accelerate once it targets international expansion. The current valuation of $26 billion looks reasonable at 6.5x sales.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Growth stocks (Everbridge,**  **Everquote, RealReal, and Chegg)** \n\nThere were a number of high quality growth stocks reporting this week. They didn’t disappoint with rapid revenue growth in huge target markets. However profitability was generally notable by its absence and valuations were sky high. Unfortunately, that is the price you have to pay today to own these disruptor stocks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst up, **Everbridge** reported a beat on Monday with revenue growth of 35%, a sharp drop in losses and was named “Growth Company of the Year” by Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council.\n\nThe company is the go to provider of critical event management (i.e. how organisations respond to events such as terrorist attacks, shooters or extreme weather) with global reach and includes most of the world’s largest companies and organizations as customers. That in itself, along with 150+ patents, is a competitive advantage. Growth has been strong and retention rates excellent at 110%. Significantly customers have demonstrated a reluctance to change provider once on boarded.\n\nEverbridge’s valuation is high (very high), at $3 billion it is about 15x current year estimated sales. However, compared to its TAM of $40 billion it looks justifiable. Additionally, with three quarters of revenues from the US, there is the real opportunity for international growth. Specifically, the EU has mandated that all member states must have alerting services in place over the next few years. Deployment across the 27 members expected over the next 18 months. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Tuesday **Everquote**, an insurance comparison website, shot up 30% after reporting a 61% year on year revenue increase and 81% yoy increase in quote requests. Everquote is priced on a more reasonable price to sales ratio of 4x current year estimates. That’s probably due to the company facing numerous competitors from other comparison websites. Nevertheless with a market capitalization of $12 billion compared to an estimated TAM of $120 billion there is still plenty of room for growth and the company’s offering is clearly resonating with customers. Additionally the company reported strong growth in property and health insurance which offers a profitable add-on service for Everquote as well as diversification from its current concentration in auto insurance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe **RealReal** (the leading online marketplace for designer clothing, fine jewellery, watches, fine art and home decor) reported strong results on Monday with sales up 55% but the stock price was hit by a CNBC report on negative customer reviews and counterfeit merchandise.  It ended the week down 25% with a market capitalization of $1.3 billion.\n\nThat valuation (4x sales) looks cheap compared to growth and outlook. RealReal offers a marketplace for luxury items that has resonated with younger customers who see the value opportunity of owning luxury goods for just a short time while also appreciating the ethical aspects of recycling.\n\nThe company has responded to claims of fake merchandise quickly. Its processes are industry leading and, at the end of the day, it offers a guarantee for authenticity so customers should be reassured. Consequently I would expect this scandal to pass quickly and the strong tail winds that are driving this industry will push the stock significantly higher.\n\nThe risk is that the company has been seriously negligent on authentication in its rush for growth and that there is a wave of bad news waiting to come out. If that is the case, then its reputation is ruined. However the bottom line for me is that the total addressable market for luxury goods in the US is massive at $198 billion. That means the risk return still looks favourable with RealReal in the early stages of growth. The potential downside is (as always) 100% but that compares to huge potential upside given the current gross merchandise volume of just $1 billion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chegg** (online textbook and tutoring services) also reported strong results with revenues up 28% and raised guidance. Over the past 30 years, textbook prices have increased 812% and in the same time, the average tuition fee has increased 559%. In an attempt to help students cope with this financial burden, Chegg offers the rental of both physical and digital textbooks. The stock jumped 14% in response to the print and now trades on a PE of 42x and PS 10x. That is another pricey multiple but Chegg still looks interesting because;\n\n1. Fat gross profit margins\n\n2. Moat provided by huge supply of over 25 million answered questions and 5million textbooks. This massive supply of premium content is hard to replicate for most entrants.\n\n3. Huge potential for growth with business so far catering for just 2.2 million out of a total of 36 million students\n\n4. Highly scalable business with profits expected to rise exponentially as sales increase\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Value stocks (Air Lease and WW International)**\n\n**Air Lease** (aircraft leasing) reported Q3 earnings on Wednesday with revenues up 19.4% and earnings up 9.2%. The company said that despite meaningful delays from both Boeing and Airbus the company plans a 25% year-over-year fleet value expansion and strong growth is expected to continue with 316 aircraft on the order books. Additionally, it was able to report that all aircraft previously leased to (now defunct) Thomas Cook have been profitably placed with new airline customers.\n\nLike most aircraft leasing companies, Air Lease trades on a very attractive trailing PE of 9.3 despite strong historic and forecast growth. However what sets Air Lease apart from the others is its CEO, Steven Udvar-Hazy, a pioneer in airline leasing with over 40 years of experience. In 1973, he co-founded the aircraft leasing business International Lease Finance Corporation (now AerCap) and led ILFC as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer until his departure in 2010 to launch Air Lease.\n\nAir Lease has grown steadily over the past 10 years and tailwinds from rising global incomes and demand for more efficient aircraft are boosting strong order books. Air Lease wil probably never trade on a big premium but with historic and forecast CAGR of 17% it can still provide a good return for investors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**WW International** (Weight Watchers) dropped 20% on Wednesday after reporting revenue of $348.6 million for the quarter, down from $365.8 million last year and missing guidance for $353.0 million. However WW is expecting a few things to help drive revenue in the coming months and raised full year guidance. Product sales that have been down for the year are expected to turn positive in the fourth quarter due to new merchandise and “improving studio attendance trends,” according to the CFO.\n\nMore importantly it was reported that Oprah will be doing huge tour for Weight Watchers next year where she will tour the country to discuss her health journey and dialogue with experts on how to live healthier lifestyles. Oprah hasn’t been on a tour like this since 2014 and the surrounding fanfare is expected to bring an influx of new subscribers. Trailing PE 15.23.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Insider (Zovio and Assured Guarantee Ltd)**\n\nThere was insider buying at **Zovio** (online education) on Tuesday, by Chief Executive Officer Andrew S. Clark who purchased 150,000 shares for a cost of $2.58 each, for a total investment of $386,505. Zovio has fallen back to $2.30 since then but is up 44% since reporting Q3 results on October 31. \n\nOn that call the education technology services company (and owner of online Ashford University) outlined a restructuring plan to drive cost savings totalling $51 million in 2020 and drive the company back to profitability with guidance for adjusted EPS of $0.50 to$0.90. If successfull the current stock price of $2.29 would be a bargain. The CEO’s purchase is an encouraging endorsement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInsider buying at **Assured Guarantee Ltd** as Chief Investment Officer, Andrew Feldstein, makes a $1.17 million purchase on Wednesday.  It is actually his 13th purchase in the last six weeks.\n\nThe company is a monoline guarantor that insures municipal and structured debt issuance. It ran into trouble during the great recession but has staged something of a recovery and Mr Feldstein seems to be highly confident in its future.\n\nTwo points of interest that caught my eye;\n\n1. The company estimates it’s non GAAP adjusted book value at $90.18 compared to Fridays close at $48.23 (GAAP valuation of $68.94 also compares well) \n\n2. The company CEO said on the Q2 earnings call that he believed the firm had $3.2 billion of excess capital beyond what was required to maintain its AAA rating. A meaningful amount for a company with a market capitalization of $4.8 billion.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease feel free to “FOLLOW” me if you would like to see my regular updates during the week.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell.

{"title": "Getting Better With Each Trade", "selftext": "Hello friends, just want to post something somewhat valuable that's not a joke or edgy or whatever.\n\nBeen trading for 5 months now and at present day I can say that I've won small and lost bigger. I'm preparing for Monday to tank what is left in my account after a little less than thoughtful bet on Activision blizzard. I was in about 1100 on call options exp 11/15. A couple weeks before this I lost a huge 1500 on AMD because I panic sold it when the stock dipped after ER, I was holding 11/15s on that play as well, which now would have made me very profitable.\n\nI won small on options for Master card, Nvidia a month back and Spy. Even though I feel great about those small wins, I hate myself for pushing limits and losing pretty much everything. But I think there are definitely positives to losing money like this. First thing I learned was to not bet on weeklies. For now on, I'm only doing monthlies. I also learned the hard way about IV crush and low volume options, and buying options at bad entry points. I definitely feel like I am smarter for these little mistakes.\n\nMy next plays will be much more calculated. Right now I'm looking at Nike calls for January exp, Zillow calls for 2021, and I'm gonna take another jab at amd for January exp.

Risk management - I don't know how big your account is but given the trades you posted it seems like your oversizing your positions and swinging for the fences. I have a 100k trading account and I run 2k position sizes. That's 2% per trade and I generally have 12-16 trades on. If a trade goes against me I generally recover 50% so 1% max loss per trade.
