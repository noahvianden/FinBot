Do you know what “shorting” is?  If you actually are shorting Apple and you bought and sold at the prices stated you will LOSE 15 dollars a share.  Not make 15 dollars.  Think of shorting as using borrowed stock, which it sometimes is exactly that,  you buy or borrow at 240 hoping the price goes down so you can return it to its owner at a lower value making the difference in profit.  If the stock goes up, and you have to “cover your short” at 255 you have to buy it at 255 to pay it back, thus losing 15 dollars a share.  Most small investors don’t have the infrastructure to actually short a stock in this way so they use Put and Call options to make the same bet but in a different way and a closed end loss.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I confused shorting for short term trading.
