As far as a formula, sure, they are out there, but you're not really working with enough capital to justify dynamic delta hedging on a continual basis.  Many traders with your account size will aim to keep their delta in a comfort zone and re-hedge when that zone is breached.  Also, don't underestimate the value of a deep OTM wing buy for hedging short puts.  You can go far enough out to avoid cannibalizing your theta/vega from the short while still having protections against the downside.  Just try out a few things and see what's best for your risk tol.
