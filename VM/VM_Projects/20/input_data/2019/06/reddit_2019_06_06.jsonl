Valuation versus pricing.  He mentions this only to say that ARK isn't really doing a valuation, but he doesn't seem to realize the key reason for that, being that a pricing model makes way more sense for a company like this.\n\nUnless he seriously believes Tesla will grow for the next 9 years and then plateau, his valuation is pointless.  Today he values the company based on revenue 9 years from now. Nine years from now, he'll be doing the same calculation and valuing the company based on its revenues in another 9 years.  He explicitly mentions doing the same thing back in 2012 and using that as a reason not to invest.  Well, the missing link was that back in 2012 he wasn't looking 9 years ahead and asking \"how would I value this company in 9 years?  By looking another 9 years ahead...\"\n\nThat's where a pricing model makes more sense.  Unless you're willing to forecast the true end state of this company to get an endgame valuation, any valuation you can come up with will just be a step along the path to another, higher valuation based on more projected growth.\n\nThat's what a pricing model does for you.  If you take a future state size, margin, growth rate, and a reasonable PEG ratio, that gives you a future dated stock price that might actually capture the company's future potential as it is perceived at that future date.\n\n# Pricing Model\n\nJust based on the car business, let's look at Tesla's historic revenue growth:  [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue) \n\nJust looking at the last five years, Tesla has managed to grow revenue 11x.  That's a CAGR of **62% growth per year.**  Now every time I've mentioned this fact on this sub before, one of the resident bears points out that there's no way 2019 grows that much over 2018, which I don't dispute.  But that historical chart also had lumps and plateaus in it on smaller timescales.  We know GF3 is coming online near the end of this year.  We know the Model Y will start production sometime in 2020.  We know Telsa is going to continue to grow fast.  We also know the total addressable market is very large so the growth can continue for some time.\n\nLet's assume for the sake of argument that 2019 winds up being a consolidation year and Tesla, while slowing its growth, manages to find a path to an operational profit margin of 5% in 2020 with a total revenue of $30 Billion.  Let's also assume that its forecasted growth rate cuts in half to 30%.  If Tesla were valued like a FAANG company, with a PEG ratio of about 2, that would give it a P/E of 60 (much less than that of Netflix) and a valuation at about 3x Revenues (60 \\* 5%) for a total of $90 Billion or about $520 per share at the current share count.\n\nThat's a price that properly accounts for the forecasted growth of the company and doesn't rely on assuming the company will be done growing in 9 years.\n\n# Valuation Model\n\nIf we insist on using his valuation model, the least he could do is not assume it stops growing at any significant rate in 5 years.  The current product roadmap easily leads them to more than 3x unit sales and probably something like his year 6 revenue of $76 Billion.  I don't think it'll take Tesla 6 years to ramp the Y and the Pickup and the Semi, but even if it does, does he really think they aren't going to add more vehicle lines in that time?  Delivery vans/trucks, large passenger vans/small busses, a lighter or heavier duty pickup, a more budget friendly large SUV without crazy one-of-a-kind tech... The total vehicle market is pretty big and Tesla has no reason not to keep expanding into more areas.\n\nIf we fix his growth assumptions at something closer to 30% per year for the full 10 years of his time horizon, we come up with $223 Billion and a share value of closer to $420.  If we assume instead that Tesla sticks closer to their historic CAGR with something like 45%, we get to $623 Billion in revenue and a share value of $1127.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nI really can see no justification for his choice to assume Tesla's growth rate takes a nosedive from its historic rate and, regardless of what analysis you use, that assumption will limit your result.  His very limiting assumptions and his disdain for Elon all fit into a theme of wanting to walk away from what has set Tesla apart from other companies and instead see it behave and perform more traditionally - and then he chooses to value it as if that were the case and call it overvalued when other people see it for what it is.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Seems like quite a reasonable approach", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "As usual in these, all the value is in “terminal value”.
