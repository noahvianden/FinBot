That’s considered a very high profit margin for a conventional gasoline-powered car, but no one else is anywhere close with electric vehicles. And yes, you have to cut some corners with the fit and finish to get there. Still, Munro says his opinion of the Tesla Model 3 has changed. The impressive systems integration makes this a sustainable vehicle for Tesla. \n\nThis analysis is based on the upgraded Model 3 with the long-range battery and enhanced autopilot, which costs around $55,000. Munro is hesitant to speak to the profitability of the $35,000 base model, but it should have most of the same efficient electronics. It might not be 30 percent profit, but Tesla is probably still making plenty on each unit.\"", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": ">With the full report done, Munro & Associates says Tesla is earning more than 30 percent profit on each Model 3 sold\n\nAnd Tesla's 8-K says they are sub 20%", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Wait till you hear LYFT loses like $2 on each ride.
