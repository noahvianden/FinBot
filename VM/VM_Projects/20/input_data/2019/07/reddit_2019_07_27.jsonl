{"title": "Urban Trade Breakdowns: Richard Cantillon Trades The World’s First Government Sponsored Stock Bubbles", "selftext": "In 1715, John Law, a drunkard Scottish playboy gambler economist, escaped from death row in a London prison where he awaited execution for murder, and fled to Paris. There he drank and fucked  his way through town, and somewhere along the way, he developed a friendship with the Regent of France, whose official title was the Duke of Orleans, but at the time was serving his country as the royal babysitter of the French King, Louie XV, who was 5-years old.  Being 5-years old and all, Louis was not yet very good with money and laws and shit, which meant the Regent had to run the day-to-day shit in France, and that was a thankless job because France was drowning in war debt and the economy was fucked. \n\nSo one night, while sipping cognac in front of the fireplace in some big-ass room full of silk curtains and paintings and shit, Law pitches the Regent on an idea: grant me the exclusive right to start a bank and print shitloads of paper money in France (which was a new thing at the time), and I will relieve France of its national debt, stimulate the shitty economy, and cheer you the fuck up.  And the Regent was like, cool, knock yourself out.\n\nAnd so law starts his bank and does his thing and in no time, with all the new paper money flooding the French economy in search of shit to buy and places to invest, things are looking tres bon.  Which was cool and all, but Law knew that the money printing hustle was unsustainable if he couldn’t also control demand, so he pitches the Regent on a new company, the Comagnie Occident (Company of the West), which would be given exclusive trading rights to the French Louisiana Territory (basically all of the Atlantic Ocean) in exchange for taking over France’s national debt, which he would use to fund his company and pay dividends on the stock he would sell to sop up all the money he was printing.\n\nAnd thats what he did, and the stock went ape-shit.  Between January and December of 1719, shares in Law’s company, now called Compagne des Indes (aka The Mississippi Company in English), went from 500 Livres (old French money) to 10,000 Livres.  That’s a 1900% gain in 11 months.  By that point, the Regent and the rest of the French peacocks sign over the whole fucking show to Law, and granting him exclusive rights to all of France’s global trade, coin minting, and tax collecting.\n\nSo begins the Mississippi bubble. \n\nMeanwhile across the Channel, the English were dealing with the same kinda shit.  Their economy also sucked and they were also drowning in war debt while frantically racing to out-plunder the rest of Europe in the New World. So one day in 1711, Thomas Harley, a wig-wearing career politician and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in England (the government money guy) reads about Law and thinks, fuck, we need to do that too.  But Harley didn’t know anything about stocks (which, at the time, was commoner shit you did if you didn’t own land).  But he vaguely remembered one dude from some committee testimony or something a few years back, a guy by the name of John Blunt who seemed to understand the shit.  So he orders people around and arranged meetings and in time, John Blunt and Thomas Harley scheme up the South Seas Company, a straight up government sponsored publically traded financial fraud, with a few derelict ships that rarely left port, but an exclusive right to the boundless potential of New World riches and a government guaranteed shareholder dividend which they would sell as stock.\n\nBut there was one problem, by 1720, crazy-ass stock schemes like this became a thing in the UK, with shitloads of these fraudulent “bubble” companies created to cash in on the trend.  And that created competition for South Seas stock, which was not cool.  So in 1720, the English parliament passed the Bubble Act which outlawed any stock scheme not ran by the English government.  Problem solved.\n\nAnd with no competition, South Seas Company stock goes  ballistic.  In the six months from January to June, 1720, the shit goes from 128GBP to 1000GBP for an 842% gain.  By contrast, Amazon grew 188% during the dotcom bubble. \n\nAnd so began the South Seas Bubble. \n\nEnter Richard Cantillon.  Sometime in the early 1700s, Cantillon, an Irish banker and financial savant, moved to Paris where he met Law and helped him finance his businesses.  Not a lot is known about the dude.  He wrote one influential economic paper and then at the age of 34, he either burned to death in his London home, murdered by arson in a fire set by his French chef, or he disappeared to South America. \n\nBut Cantillon was the world’s OG first and greatest trader of state-sponsored government asset bubble schemes.  Like Law, Cantillon believed that flooding the market with paper money could boost a shitty, indebted European economy, but Cantillon was convinced that no amount of financial engineering could make it last.  Only “entrepreneurs” (a term he coined) created real economic value.  Everything else was dumb money, which he could trade.\n\nSo in 1716 he goes all-in on Mississippi Company stock (Law’s shit), buying at 160 and selling at 2000, for a gain of over 1200 percent.  And then he retires to Italy.  But in Italy, Cantillon gets the French newspapers and sees the Mississippi Company stock go to 3000, and then 5000, and eventually 10,000.  Fuck, he thinks, and returns to Paris to see this shit for himself.  And what he finds is a booming economy and a strong currency and investor enthusiasm for the untapped potential of boundless New World riches.  But Cantillon calls bullshit and goes short, and uses investor money to leverage his trades, making a fortune on the simple premise that asset prices should increase roughly proportionate to value created in the economy.   As ridiculous as this sounds today, Cantillon believed you cant fake shit with stock schemes and financial engineering.  If asset prices outpace value creation, the shit would correct.\n\nSo after making his second bubble fortune when the Mississippi bubble collapses, Cantillon eventually finds his way to London, just as the South Seas Company was near the peak.  There he goes all-in short, but this time with puts, not just on the stock, but anything he could find that tracked the stock.  And when shit starts to tank, deep in the money but nowhere near the bottom, he exits.  \n\nHow fucking cool is it that 300 years later, in the era of light-speed digital algos and one-less-car hippy S&P indexing and dark web bad-bank derivative bail-outs, the OG shit – money printing, stock bubbles, government sponsored financial schemes – remain timeless.", "id": "cibfn1", "created_utc": 1564190759.0, "score": 113, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "anyone fancies reading more about shit like this - including more on the South Sea and Mississippi bubbles - do check out Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds by Mackay", "score": 22, "replies": []}, {"body": "VERY much looking forward to reading this as I’m falling asleep tonight.

Other then Cisco those Companies had an elevated P/E ratio but nothing as crazy as the dot-coms and was based on huge revenue and earnings growth largly by dot-coms buying hardware/software from those companies.\n\n[March 2000:](https://seekingalpha.com/article/2986486-15-years-after-bubble-burst-tech-stocks-competitively-priced)\n\n||CSCO|MSFT|INTC|ORCL|IBM|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|P/E|221.7|65.9|27.4|21.4|28.4|\n|Market Cap|$591.4B|$620.0B|$341.4B|$135.0B|$229.7B|\n\nSo at the time it was pretty reasonable to be long those companies because of the real income they generated, if you didn't account from where the money was really coming from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimilar example now with money burning Electric Scooter sharing companies:\n\n* [Lime valuation $2.4b with $765m in total funding](https://growjo.com/company/Lime)\n* [Bird valuation of $2b with $415m in total funding](https://growjo.com/company/Bird)\n* [Uber, Lyft and Ford going in too](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/23/the-electric-scooter-wars-of-2018/)\n\nThe capital spend mostly trickles down the supply chain to [Ninebot who bought Segway for $75m in 2015 and sold 1M Scooters in 2018](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/30/tech/segway-history/index.html) . Plus Bird [said](https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/16/18141418/scooter-vandalism-rugged-bird-lime-spin-acton) its electric scooters tend to last one to two months before they need to be replaced. Lime’s scooters have a similar lifespan. This lunacy is just one part of the current misallocation of VC money which leads to misallocation in the supply chain. But this is just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are now [376 private unicorn startups](https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies) ($1b+ valuation) in the world with a total market cap of $1.2t. The total capital invested worldwide by VCs in [2018 was $254b and $65b just in Q4 2018](https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2019/01/kpmg-venture-pulse-q4-2018.pdf). Just for comparision the US VC investing in 2000, which was largly equilivant to global VC spend because Asia and Europe was to small, reached a peak of [$120b](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-01-08/venture-capital-still-flowing-to-silicon-valley-and-bay-area) in that year.\n\nWhen you exclude Asia from [what VC invested in the last 6 years was](https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2019/01/kpmg-venture-pulse-q4-2018.pdf):\n\n|Year|Quarter|US in Billion $|Europe in Billion $|Total EU+US|Mean Total|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2013|Q1|11|2.5|13.5|14.2|\n||Q2|11|3.3|14.3||\n||Q3|11|2.9|13.9||\n||Q4|12|3|15||\n|2014|Q1|15|3.5|18.5|21.4|\n||Q2|20|3.5|23.5||\n||Q3|16|4.2|20.2||\n||Q4|20|3.4|23.4||\n|2015|Q1|21|4.5|25.5|25.4|\n||Q2|20|4.3|24.3||\n||Q3|24|5.5|29.5||\n||Q4|18|4.2|22.2||\n|2016|Q1|20|5.5|25.5|24.0|\n||Q2|25|4.7|29.7||\n||Q3|17|4.5|21.5||\n||Q4|15|4.1|19.1||\n|2017|Q1|16|4.3|20.3|26.0|\n||Q2|21|6.2|27.2||\n||Q3|25|5.1|30.1||\n||Q4|20|6.3|26.3||\n|2018|Q1|30|6.3|36.3|38.8|\n||Q2|28|6.3|34.3||\n||Q3|31|5.6|36.6||\n||Q4|42|5.9|47.9||\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is 174% (248% when Asia is included) growth over 6 years, or 18% YoY, vs 75% with S&P500 or 128% with nasdaq in the same timeframe (Jan 2013 - Jan 2019).\n\nSo where is all the money going and how much of it is ending on public balance sheets?\n\nNext to employees, as the biggest expense, is Sales & Marketing and tech stack. I assume 40% goes to employees wages 20% S&M, 20% tech and 20% other.\n\nNow how fast are they spending their invested capital? [Monthly Burn rate  for different startup funding phases](https://brex.com/blog/state-of-spend/).\n\n* Pre-Seed: 48% of the companies have a monthly burn > $18k.\n* Seed: 65% of the companies have a monthly burn > $50k and an average capital raise of $1.1m => They spend 4.5% of their capital per month\n* Series A: 47% of the companies have a monthly burn > $400k and an average capital raise of $8m => They spend 5% of capital per month\n* Startups which succeeded to exist/raise capital after Series A: 50% of the companies have a monthly burn > $900k raise on average $16.5m => They spend 5.5% of capital per month\n\nSo a typical startup spends about 15% per Quarter of its invested capital plus its generated revenues, which I neglect from this calculation. $47.9b in one quarter invested from VC then leads to $7.2b additional money spend per quarter for roughly 6 quarters. So tanking the numbers above this leads to:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Year|Quarter|Additional 15% burn rate capital for 6Q in Billion $|Cumulated spend over 6Q in Billion $|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2013|Q1|2.0|2.0|\n||Q2|2.1|4.2|\n||Q3|2.1|6.3|\n||Q4|2.3|8.5|\n|2014|Q1|2.8|11.3|\n||Q2|3.5|14.8|\n||Q3|3.0|15.8|\n||Q4|3.5|17.2|\n|2015|Q1|3.8|18.9|\n||Q2|3.6|20.3|\n||Q3|4.4|22.0|\n||Q4|3.3|21.8|\n|2016|Q1|3.8|22.6|\n||Q2|4.5|23.5|\n||Q3|3.2|22.9|\n||Q4|2.9|22.1|\n|2017|Q1|3.0|20.7|\n||Q2|4.1|21.5|\n||Q3|4.5|22.2|\n||Q4|3.9|21.7|\n|2018|Q1|5.4|23.9|\n||Q2|5.1|26.2|\n||Q3|5.5|28.6|\n||Q4|7.2|31.7|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo in Q4 2018 approx. $32b was burned by startups, now I use the assumption that 20% of this, about $6.3b, is spend on Sales & Marketing and $6.3b is spend on IT. I also use the [Googles](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266249/advertising-revenue-of-google/) and [Facebooks](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271258/facebooks-advertising-revenue-worldwide/) yearly advertising revenues and average down to a Quarter from 2016 - 2018:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Year|Quarter|Per quarter average Google+Fb revenue in Billion $|20% Percent of  Cumulated VC spend for S&M in Billion $|Ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2016|Q1|26.57|4.5|16.98%|\n||Q2|26.57|4.7|17.69%|\n||Q3|26.57|4.6|17.24%|\n||Q4|26.57|4.4|16.66%|\n|2017|Q1|33.83|4.1|12.26%|\n||Q2|33.83|4.3|12.71%|\n||Q3|33.83|4.4|13.12%|\n||Q4|33.83|4.3|12.81%|\n|2018|Q1|42.83|4.8|11.16%|\n||Q2|42.83|5.2|12.22%|\n||Q3|42.83|5.7|13.36%|\n||Q4|42.83|6.3|14.81%|\n\nSo Googles and Facebooks Adverting business would have 12-15% exposure to Venture Capital induced spending.\n\nAnd Cloud?  AWS has a cloud [market share of 32.3%](https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/cloud-market-share-q4-2018-and-full-year-2018) in Q4 2018. I'm using this [data](https://www.statista.com/statistics/250520/forecast-of-amazon-web-services-revenue/) for their Quarterly revenues. So I'm assuming 32% of the 20% IT budget for AWS:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Year|Quarter|AWS Revenue in Billion $|32% of Startups IT budget in Billion $|Ratio|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2016|Q1|2.6|1.4|55.53%|\n||Q2|2.9|1.5|51.87%|\n||Q3|3.2|1.5|45.81%|\n||Q4|3.5|1.4|40.46%|\n|2017|Q1|3.7|1.3|35.88%|\n||Q2|4.1|1.4|33.55%|\n||Q3|4.6|1.4|30.87%|\n||Q4|5.1|1.4|27.20%|\n|2018|Q1|5.4|1.5|28.32%|\n||Q2|6.1|1.7|27.46%|\n||Q3|6.7|1.8|27.34%|\n||Q4|7.4|2.0|27.44%|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo AWS would have approx. 30% exposure to VC funded Startup capital.
