The best way to counter that is to have a good development pipeline of slightly junior folks who are ready to step up and take the reins.\n\nIf people are leaving for the sake of leaving, I do agree it’s a problem, but if they are leaving because they are getting poached, that to me is a different ballgame.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Ya but at that level, most of their comp is coming in the form of equity. If they really believed Tesla was worlds ahead of the comp it would be much more lucrative to have, say, .01% of shares in Tesla than 5% in a new EV startup with a high chance of failure. It’s rare to see top execs with a sizeable chunk of equity in a high growth company leave unless they think the stock will stay flat, decline, or not grow as quickly as they think/want. Not to mention, leaving early would mean they’re also willing to forfeit their vesting stock/options. Obviously this is overly simplified and very subjective but ya it definitely raises eyebrows.
