That inertia is in the form of a huge amount of sunk-cost infrastructure that depends on overly-cheap fossil energy. Everything from houses to electrical generation to the Haber process for creating nitrogen fertilizer depends on that overly-cheap fossil gas.\n\nBut to answer your question: the cheapest way to heat a Minnesota house (or a Canadian house, which I know a decent amount about) is to insulate it better. We have the technology to cut the average (2000 sq ft) home heating cost down to the electricity it costs to run two TVs. *That* is how you cut back on gas.\n\nBut you'll also note I never said a *cut back* on gas. Even if we continue extracting at the same rate to power our existing infrastructure, we can grind fossil fuel *growth* to a dead halt simply by not building new infrastructure at that same terrible standard. An updated national building code, or even a carbon price that uses the market to encourage that kind of construction, will destroy any growth potential in natural gas stocks. And there's no inertia behind laws -- no reason that they can't change tomorrow or next year -- in comparison to the inertia behind sunk-cost infrastructure.\n\nIt's the same for oil. We need about 4% of our current production for plastics -- the rest is burned. And as the people who buy new cars start to realize that electric makes economic sense for their lifestyles (and for a lot of people, myself included, a battery electric vehicle is the cheapest option), less oil production will be needed. Which in turn results in fewer wells, and less gas that needs to come out of the ground. We'll still be burning gas in the old cars -- until they wear out. Constantly decreasing the market for oil.\n\nI've taken all my investments out of any funds that still invest in fossil fuel infrastructure (with the exception of about $1K still sitting in a US index fund) and bet pretty big on the industries that supply the materials for a renewable energy economy -- solar manufacturers; lithium, cobalt, vanadium miners; electric car makers -- and I'd recommend you do the same. \n\nFossil fuels are a no-growth industry.

First, the contentious Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The estimated cost to purchase and build this expansion is about [$14 billion dollars.](https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/cost-to-twin-trans-mountain-pipeline-now-1-9b-higher-kinder-morgan-says)\n\nSecond, the proposed [Kitimat LNG terminal.](https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/chevrons-supersized-b-c-lng-project-a-glimmer-of-hope-for-struggling-gas-producers) $40 billion to improve LNG export capability. \n\nTogether, these two projects represent $54 billion in capital. $54B which need not be spent on fossil fuel infrastructure at all. What would happen if we spent this money on renewables?\n\nWell, the upcoming [Whabouchi mine](https://www.nemaskalithium.com/en/whabouchi/) and related processing plant has a cost of about $1.2B and represents an increase of about 20% of the world's lithium supply. An additional $5B to develop four more similar deposits in Quebec would double the world's lithium supply. The output of this project is the chemical needed for all battery storage. We have the reserves, we just lack the capital to dig and process them.\n\nAnd speaking of battery storage: Tesla's Gigafactory will cost an estimated $5B at completion and will have an annual output of 150 GWh of battery storage capacity. Current worldwide annual output is less than 1000 GWh -- so 6 more of these, at a cost of just $30B, will *also* double the annual battery production rate.\n\nWe've only spent $36B of the $54B on the table. Throw the other $18B into ten solar panel factories and you'll be able to produce enough solar electricity (even at 25% capacity factor) to power the entire province of Alberta.\n\nBut here's what really matters: the cost of just two currently-proposed Canadian fossil energy projects is enough capital to double the world's battery supply, with a hell of a lot left over. Just **two** fossil projects, out of hundreds or thousands currently in the works across the world! If we take the kind of absurd amounts of money we are still trying to throw at fossil fuels and instead invest them in renewables, the \"viable option to replace oil and gas\" suddenly exists.\n\nThis isn't political, nor is it ideological. It's just math. And the math for fossil fuel expansion just doesn't add up. Where it becomes political and \"ideological\" (if your ideology is science) is when you take into account the increasing public awareness and mounting pressure to take action in the face of climate change. The technology exists to expand renewables. The capital exists to expand renewables. And no sane person, knowing that, would willingly allow investment in fossil fuels instead. Take your money out of oil and gas now, or leave it in at your own peril.\n\n(Oh, and [none of my electrical power is coal.](https://live.gridwatch.ca/home-page.html) Some is gas, but historically that's averaged at about 8%.

Where is the magical 54 billion coming from? Your assumption is they're taking money away from renewables to invest in fossil fuels, but that's not how it works.\n\nUnfortunately that's exactly how it works. The immediate allocation of capital is a zero-sum game: any capital allocated towards new fossil infrastructure is capital that is not allocated to building new renewable infrastructure.\n\nRemember what capital is. In principle, it's just an abstraction for the fact that we allow certain people to command the output of our economy. As a rough order-of-magnitude estimate, it costs $100k to employ a person for a year. (And every dollar that a project costs eventually ends up as *somebody's* salary.) A five-year project costing $50B therefore means you are taking 100,000 people for those five years and putting them on a project. Which means those 100,000 people are unavailable for any *other* project over those five years.\n\n> The oil and gas companies that are funding the infrastructure for the pipeline fund it for profit. The pipeline companies charge a fee to move the product to port. That's the best part about capitalism. If someone can make a profit off of doing something, they will. They're free to invest it in whatever they want.\n\nYes and no. There's a lot of nuance hidden behind this simplification. Why do the people investing capital in new fossil infrastructure think it will be profitable at all, let alone more profitable than renewables? Detailed analysis of the pipeline project in particular shows that, at 100% capacity, it achieves $10B revenue in 2038 and won't break even until 2048 -- so why would a pipeline company try to expand the pipeline anyway?^† Do they know something we don't about how money works or how math works? Or are they just building pipelines because they're a pipeline company? (In business school they call this \"focusing on your core competency\" -- and it's great until your core competency is obsolete.)\n\nWhen you choose to invest in fossil infrastructure, you are betting that the underlying assumptions of that industry are not going to change. That people will just accept continued burning of fossil fuels for the foreseeable future.\n\nBut we know those underlying assumptions *have* to change. And more importantly, voters (and therefore governments) are realizing that they have to change. What happens to your investment when the only institution that can legitimately use force decides the project must stop? This is the problem with your final statement, \"they are free to invest it in whatever they want.\" You missed the subordinate clause: \"subject to the laws of the land and thus the values of the people who live there.\"\n\nBy investing in new fossil infrastructure, you're betting on one of three things:\n\n- that governments will fail to regulate new fossil infrastructure, against the wishes of their populations,\n- that individuals who are investing in new infrastructure (e.g. houses, cars) will continue to choose options that require the burning of fossil fuels, despite knowing how destructive it is, or,\n- that you can find someone dumber than you to buy it from you for a profit down the road.\n\nI don't think it's a good bet.\n\n> As for your electricity, that's lovely you dont have coal, but it's still 27% of the grid.... Hydro is awesome and SHOULD be the power source where its geographically feasible. But Hydro is only 7% of the grid....\n\nWhat grid? My grid -- serving 23 million people across two provinces -- is 0% coal. And we produce excess energy for export. We're not pulling coal in from other areas to make up the difference. And if your grid is 27% coal today, then unless people invest capital in building new or refurbishing old coal plants, that percentage will continue drop.\n\nI wish you the best of luck with your investments.

But that rise was just one step in PayPal's relentless 2019 climb. Overall, the stock is up roughly 41% so far this year.\nOn Wednesday, the payment processing specialist will be back in the news with its Q2 financial report. For PayPal investors, the focus will be on whether the company can maintain this strong momentum. Here are three metrics stock watchers will be paying particular attention to when earnings are released after the closing bell.\n\n1. Revenue growth\nPayPal's revenue rose 12% year over year in Q1, though that number was adversely affected by the sale of its portfolio of consumer receivables to Synchrony Financial. Adjusting for that one-time event, revenue increased by 19%.\nFor Q2, PayPal has guided for its solid growth to continue, with revenue expected to increase by 11% to 13% year over year, or by 12% to 13% after excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nFrom the perspective of Wall Street, analysts' consensus estimate calls for revenue of $4.33 billion, up about 12% year over year, which is at the midpoint of management's guidance.\n2. Earnings per share\nDuring Q1, PayPal reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.78, easily surpassing the $0.68 high end of management's guidance, which also matched analysts' consensus estimates.\nPayPal explained that $0.08 per share of that result derived from its recent equity investment in MercadoLibre. PayPal announced in March that it had laid out $750 million to tap the ongoing adoption of e-commerce and fintech in Latin America, and had been impressed by the company's management.\nIn a recent regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, PayPal said it expected to report a pre-tax gain of $218 million from its strategic investments, which is expected to result in a benefit of about $0.14 per share in Q2. \nPayPal had previously guided for adjusted EPS in a range of $0.68 to $0.70 per share. Wall Street clearly believed that management is being too conservative in its forecast, with expectations for EPS of $0.71.\n3. A growing and highly engaged user base\nPayPal has been able to consistently put up strong revenue and earnings numbers because of its ability to expand its user base and to increase the engagement of its existing users. The company added 9.3 million net new active accounts during Q1, bringing its total to 277 million, up 15% year over year. It expects to exceed 300 million active accounts by year's end. \nThe number of transactions per active account, which is an indicator of engagement, grew to 38, up 9% compared to the prior-year quarter.\nOne of the highlights of its user base activity is the rapidly growing use of Venmo. While it began as a free person-to-person (P2P) payment app, it can now be used to pay merchants anywhere PayPal is accepted. The company recently revealed that Venmo has grown to more than 40 million active users, and those customers are driving significant increases in total payment volume, up 73% year over year in Q1. Venmo is on pace to process nearly $100 billion in transactions in 2019.\nWatch for additional updates on PayPal's growing active user base.\n\nArticle from Motley Fool. https://imgur.com/gallery/oJlY6nc", "id": "cfncj0", "created_utc": 1563638259.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "So all in on PayPal calls?!?", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "yes ..
