It really doesn’t matter who wins because our government has been fucking us for decades but I would still rather see trump win. Nonetheless, I believe the market will drop substantially in the coming months and he will not win re-election due to that. After the July rate cut comes through, in October-December we should see the delusion starting to fade and real worry start to kick in. Should be fun to watch the paper gains disappear, because the stock market has clearly gone away from the underlying real economy that has been struggling. In fact we’ve been in a depression for quite some time. Growing substantially less over the past decade than in the past, leaving almost 5 trillion on the table over the years. Whens the last time you saw the federal reserve contemplating a rate cut at the top of a bull market? Exactly, that should tell you something. The balance sheet and interest rates are nowhere near normal and this will cause them to raise rates during a recession and print more money (QE4).
