That's a big sum. I don't know what the consumer version will cost but it looks like it may remain at $3,500 total with Microsoft offering a $125/mo subscription plan.\n\nFinally, while it can be used for gaming, the Hololens is designed to be an AR-based Windows 10 PC you wear on your head. It's uses are still niche with Microsoft targeting research, manufacturing, education, and other industries with this.\n\nSomething to keep an eye on but it's not a bullish data point at this time.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "It's not designed to be a consumer device at all.
