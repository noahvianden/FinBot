An example of this is the AP HW3 where the chip is specifically designed to handle AP task while minimizing energy draw. Using any one COTS components might only make a few miles of range diff, but when you add up to all the components of the car, suddenly you have a 2019 Audi etron that has a bigger pack than a 2012 Model S but with less range.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Wrong.  Tesla’s batteries have many advantages.  From one of the wizards on TMD investor forum:\n\nCheaper battery cells. \n\nTesla’s three key advantages are 1) ability to use stripped back simplified cylindrical cells, 2) ability to safely use the in principle more dangerous NCA chemistry and 3) economies of scale (including standardized cell size unlike prismatic cell sizes which vary with battery pack design).\n\nThe core of 1 & 2 is that Tesla is able to use simplified cylindrical cells (with no safety systems) and NCA chemistry because it has far superior battery management software (including fleet learning benefit) and hardware – it shifts cell costs into battery pack IP (and no ICE OEMs are even attempting to catch up on this path).\n\nCylindrical battery cells\nAdvantages:\nCheaper to manufacture.\nHas the least components and simplest manufacturing process (8 components vs up to 30 for prismatic cells which are now mostly being adopted by the industry).\nCylindrical is the most mature technology and has the most automated manufacturing process with highest utilization rates in manufacturing steps.\nTesla’s NCA cylindrical cells have by far the highest volumetric energy density, I think in part due to tighter cathode winding in cylindrical structures. This should reduce pack size and hence pack (non cell) weight.\nOne cell design can fit multiple different battery packs and vehicle programs. Pouch/Prismatic generally have to be designed differently for each program so get much less economies of scale. For example CATL makes 34 different shapes of cell while BYD makes 10.\nCylindrical cells generally need less safety specific components, but Tesla’s cells are able to strip these back further - Tesla's cells lack a CID (vent ) and a positive temperature coefficient device. They can do this in part due to the pack design and software. \nMechanical stability against internal swelling.\nSmaller cells can allow better thermal management.\nThe winding process can be done faster than stacking for other cell types, they can also be wound tighter.\nDisadvantages :\nLimitation in cell size means a huge number of cells per car which makes module assembly much more difficult and makes cell balancing much more difficult. Model 3 has c.4000 cells vs c.300 pouch cells in the Bolt.\nMore cells per car also means more chance for something to go wrong.\nCylindrical cells have lower gravimetric energy density (for equal chemistry) I think mostly because smaller cylindrical cells need more housing material. This is largely compensated because it is easier to use higher cathode energy density chemistries in cylindrical cells.\nCell testing is more expensive because more cells need to be connected and tested.\n\nTesla’s NCA chemistry has the highest nickel cathode content and the highest cathode energy density of any EV. It has much less cobalt than NCM designs which reduces raw material prices and reduces supply risk. Its disadvantage is the chemistry is less stable relative to lower Nickel content/lower cathode energy density cells – this is another reason Tesla uses cylindrical cells – the smaller canned cylindrical format helps limit this instability.\n\nI think Tesla's current NCA cathode chemistry is Nickel 93% Cobalt 5% and Aluminium 2%. This compares to most common NMC 532 at 50% Nickel, 30% Manganese and 20% Cobalt.\n\nThe rest of the industry is starting to transition to higher Nickel NMC 811 (now c.7% of China cathode production) which is closer to NCA. However this chemistry will face increased manufacturing costs and increased safety challenges, particularly given the industry does not have the battery pack expertise to use smaller cylindrical cells which limit the chemical instability.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "This.\n\nRange is very important, and a big part of that equation is the efficiency.  Pre-Raven Model S/X, despite being older technology, were still more efficient than the I-Pace and E-Tron when they came out with, supposedly, the latest technologies those companies were able to acquire/produce.  Raven Model S/X are even more efficient because they now use one of the Model 3 motors instead of 2 induction motors like Pre-Raven.\n\nModel 3 in general is about 15 to 20% more efficient than a Raven Model S.  This is a big lead that Tesla has and it will be hard for others to catch up.\n\nWhy is efficiency so important?\n\n- Better TCO for customers. In the past, going for a car that got great mileage usually meant compromising on performance. With Tesla, that's no longer the case.  So, given that the most powerful cars are also the most efficient, why would you go with a car that consumes on average 220 Wh/km over one that consumes on average 180 Wh/km, while also offering _better_ performance and _higher_ range? That difference in consumption makes its way to your monthly electricity bill.  It might not be a lot, but why pay more if you don't have to? \n\n- It also enables manufacturing cost improvements.  Remember the switch in naming from 75D and 100D to Standard Range and Long Range? It's been frequently speculated that Tesla did this so they can gradually reduce the size of the battery packs while maintaining the same range due to efficiency improvements.  Even if they won't do this, the Tesla efficiency also means Tesla has a huge economical advantage when it comes to manufacturing the car: they can offer X km's of range while using _less_ battery cells than their competitors.  As we all know, the biggest part of the cost of an EV is the battery.  I never quite understood how Tesla bears are always so focused on the margins that Tesla makes per car, while simultaneously claiming that I-Pace and E-Tron's low efficiency is irrelevant (due to the ability to fast-charge them). If Tesla's cars are more efficient than their competitors, it means they are also cheaper to produce. This should be an important factor to consider whether you're short or long.\n\n- Faster charging rates, but am not even talking about how many kW you can charge at. What really matters when you're charging is: how much range did I gain during the X amount of time I've been here?  This can even make a big impact on home charging. Due to the efficiency differences, you can charge more km's per hour on a Model 3 versus a Model S.  You'll get even less km's per hour for an E-Tron or I-Pace.  Depending on your daily commute, this could even mean that you can just rely on a regular wall socket instead of having to install a wallbox.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "They also have the advantage of the gigafactory.
