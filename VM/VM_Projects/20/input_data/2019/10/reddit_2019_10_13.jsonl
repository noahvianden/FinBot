In that later phase Tesla might also start a stock buyback program, which would be anti-dilutive.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "> Not in any measurable fashion: dilution via employee stock compensation is about $200m per quarter, which is about 1.7% per year - less than U.S. inflation.\n\nI wouldn't consider 1.7% per year to be \"not in any measurable fashion\".

How worried should I be about the bear narrative that stock keeps being dilluted?\n\nDilution is so minimal that it's irrelevant. If they were financing the business with equity that would be a different story. Aligning employees with the business's interest is a good thing.\n\nAnother way to look at it: Let's say TSLA is struggling financially (they are). The potential damage to the business from decreasing cash and the potential damage to the business from high commission & compensation schemes is of greater threat to your share value. If you maintain the same number of shares but the business declines... hello $180 stock price. If you cut compensation but have a very tiny dilution to the stock, capital appreciation declines, but you could at least maintain or reduce growth rate of the stock with the benefit of having more stable operations. With the new changes you set a stronger floor, such as $220 stock price if you stabilize the operations. You reduce capital appreciation, after dilution, such as a $295 price target instead of $300. Overall, you're much better off.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I would think stock compensation will decrease turnover as well?
