{"title": "Some interesting news in the stock market this week", "selftext": "A lot of companies reporting this week. Among them Microsoft, Paypal and Intel pleased the markets while Amazon, eBay and Twitter disappointed. Looking beyond the larger names there were also some interesting  small and mid cap developments.\n\n**Consumer Cyclical** \n\n**Skechers** dropped  4% after hours on Tuesday following strong Q3 results. Sales were up 15.1% (17.2% on a constant currency basis), gross margins were up 30 bps and net income was up 13.6%. Q4 Guidance was for sales of and EPS of $0.35-$0.40 compared to $0.31 last year.\n\nIt appears that investors were profit taking after a 40% increase this year and the stock has pretty much fully recovered all of those losses. \n\nSkechers' brands have been resonating with influencers and key opinion leaders globally even if it has failed so far to resonate with investors. The brand lacks the macho appeal of Nike and Under Armour. However, in the current environment, I would consider that to be a positive.\n\nCurrently trading on $37.89 with a market cap of $5.94 billion, the PE of 17.57 looks cheap compared to recent growth and peers. Adjusting for almost $1 billion of cash and cash equivalents the PE ratio improves further to 14.8.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Airlines**\n\n**JetBlue** was up on Tuesday after reporting strong Q3 results. Adjusted earnings were up 32% and the CEO said the company was still \"on track to deliver on our goal of $2.50 to 3.00 dollars EPS in 2020\"\n\nRASM was hit in the Caribbean by Hurricane Dorian but offset by cost improvements. Domestically RASM outperformed the industry and improved by over 3%.\n\nStock price increased to $18.76 but still looks cheap compared to 2020 guidance. Beyond 2020 JBLU's plan to ditch 60 Embraer regional jets (and operate solely Airbus aircraft) should improve fuel efficiency and reduce operating costs further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Healthcare (Biogen and PDL BioPharma)**\n\n**Biogen** stock jumped 40% on Tuesday after the company announced it was reviving its approval application for Alzheimer drug Aducanumab. It was thought that that drug was dead in the water but new analysis of a larger dataset shows that the terminated Phase 3 EMERGE study met the primary endpoint . \n\nLike others, I remain sceptical about the reversal of test results and feel that the likelihood of FDA approval is by no means certain. But this is an asset that had been thought capable of generating $10 to $20 billion in sales. Even a 50/50 chance of winning approval with chunky margins and growing global demand would be significant. Biogen still trades on a trailing PE of 10.3, even after Tuesday jump, and that market valuation looks very attractive.\n\nEngine Capital published a letter on Wednesday calling on **PDL BioPharma** to consider strategic options including a possible sale or liquidation of the Company.  Now Engine Capital isn’t what you would call a well known entity but they point out that they have had numerous discussion with senior management, former employees and competitors and believe that the company has a number of high-quality assets. What we can see and what looks interesting is;\n\n1.  PDLI’s book value per share of $5.35 compares very favourably to the current $2.71 share price\n\n2. a net cash position of $156 million compares well to a market cap of $310 million\n\n3. Engine Capital’s belief that there is scope to cut about $20 million out of PDLIs cost base looks reasonable and meaningful compared to the $310 million market cap and TTM PE 8.2.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Value Stock**\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprises issues upbeat guidance on Thursday with EPS of $1.78 to $1.94 forecast for 2020 and long run CAGR of 7-9%. This is not the printing company rather it’s the technology company that serves cloud computing and storage centres. HPE has improved profitability across the company and now plans to offer everything as-a-Service to continue to drive profitable growth. Trading on 9.3x current year estimates it looks like good value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cyclicals** \n\n**Whirlpool** reported GAAP EPS of $5.57 compared to $3.22 last year on Tuesday. However adjusting for tax and gains on the sale of the compressor business to Nidec, EPS were $3.97 compared to $4.55 last year. \n\nThe company said it was trending towards the high end of its ongoing EPS guidance range of $14.75 to $15.50. That compares to Fridays stock price close at $15.36. However this is a cyclical stock and with the stock up over 50% this year I would say it’s fully valued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Insider Buying**\n\nOn Tuesday, RV manufacturer,  **Thor Industries** CEO Robert Martin picked up nearly $600,000 of stock after setting out on Monday the company’s key three targets for the year 2025 including \n\n1. $14 billion in annual net sales\n\n2. Sustainable gross margins of 16%\n\n3. Generate over $3 billion in cumulative net cash from operations\n\nThat signals a vote of confidence in ambitious targets that forecast a doubling of sales. The stock price has fallen more than 50% due to concerns that the company has increased debt, to acquire Erwin Hymer Group, just as it approaches the top of the cycle. I think that Thor has started to make progress in paying down that debt but I am concerned about where we are with the business cycle and don’t believe there is really upside after recent gains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other**\n\nThe Tile Shop stock price ended the week down 50% at $1.63 after  management reported plans to delist from the Nasdaq. Cabell Lolmaugh, the Company' s CEO, said \"we believe the savings that will benefit our shareholders outweigh the advantages of continuing as a Nasdaq-listed and SEC reporting company\". I think he needs to reconsider.\n\nPlease feel free to “FOLLOW” me if you would like to see my regular updates during the week.

Barron’s drew attention to non-recurring items in an article on Thursday. It is impossible to tell (for now) if these were material. However, the Barron’s article also suggests the pop in the stock price was caused by a short squeeze rather than a meaningful change in sentiment. I would sympathize with that view. A surprise earnings result doesn’t change the fact that Tesla faces huge competition, slowing growth and is trading on a huge valuation. More relevant in my opinion is that revenues fell 7.5%, operating profit fell 37% and earnings fell 33%.", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "Amongst other things, the earnings surprise is somewhat correlated the realization of deferred full self driving margin as fsd sw updates provided a product that drove current owners to purchase this option months or year after they first bought the car.  We will see how much this continues to support the increased 21% 3Q margins tesla has on its autos going forward.\n\nAt the same time, the increase in leased vehicles decreases immediate revenue, which is where the revenue appears flat.  \n\nCompetition is grossly overrated.  What competition?  Who is delivering even 100k EVs in 2020?  Tesla has been producing EVs for 15 years, with empty threats of competition followed by inferior products (leaf, bolt, fiat EV, i8, i3, etc).  The original model S from 2012 still outperforms 2019 competition.  The Taycan will be dated the day its released due to the 3-motor model S that will come out next year.  The growth of the EV market leaves plenty of room for new entry’s too, even as tesla continues to increase annual revenue 50% YoY going forward just as it has down for the past 15 years.  They will not cannibalize tesla sales, but their own ICE sales instead.\n\nWhats not discussed is the Model Y debut was pushed forward to mid-2020 and China GF is now in production.  These are going to greatly increase revenue.  \n\nWill be very interesting to see what short interest is at.  A profitable quarter, a flush balance sheet, and a great roadmap for 2020 does not scream only short covering.  More likely any short covering will drive stock buying from retail investors via FOMO.  Short covering is due to fundamental improvements in the company, bankruptcy being even more further removed and demand still not being an issue when considering there entire product line.  Shorts have held tesla on whispers of the thought of the possibility of lack of demand.  Evidence and fundamentals are both forcing them to cover.  Which will drive retail to buy and analyst to re-evaluate (upgrades).  \n\nTesla is due to break ATHs and is poised to do so.

Yes, the two studies were designed to be the same, but Biogen didn’t understand at the time of the futility analysis how important dosage *over time* was.

As you near that expiration, your whole position will become worthless, unless the market just absolutely tanks.\n\nThere will be a correction, I do agree with that. But I don't foresee \"The Great Depression 2.0\". With that being said, this is WSB.

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning October 28th, 2019", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 28th, 2019.\n\n# **The Fed and Apple earnings will make or break market’s return to record highs in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/25/the-fed-could-be-what-makes-or-breaks-the-stock-markets-push-into-record-territory.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks will try in the week ahead to break the all-time highs set earlier in the year as a slew of S&P 500 companies get set to report.\n*****\n> Stock prices are bumping up against their highs, but whether they can burst through and hold gains may, for the near term, depend on what investors hear from Jerome Powell in the week ahead.\n*****\n> In a week stacked with major events, the Fed’s two-day meeting is likely to be the high point. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to make its third quarter point interest rate cut Wednesday afternoon, followed by comments form Fed Chairman Powell. Those comments could be his most important message of the next few months, as investors watch to see whether he holds the door open to future rate cuts, or signals it’s time to pause, as some economists expect.\n*****\n> “Our view is they’ll be done after this. We’re not expecting a cut in December, and we’re not expecting cuts next year. The economy, in my mind, looks like it’s stabilizing, and there should be more evidence of that in the next couple of weeks. focusing on the labor market is the key thing,” said Drew Matus, chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management. If the labor market holds up, expectations for rate cuts should decline. “I do think the dissenters are arguing they shouldn’t be cutting at all.”\n*****\n> But Matus’ view is just one of many on Wall Street. Some economists expect another cut in December, while others expect one or more cuts next year, depending on how they view the economy. Goldman Sachs economists laid out a case where the Fed will clearly signal that it plans to pause after Wednesday.\n*****\n> All of this could make for volatility in stocks and bonds, depending on which market view prevails in Powell’s comments. “It’s going to be choppy going into the Fed,” said Andrew Brenner of National Alliance. In the past week, yields were higher with the 10-year Treasury yield touching 1.8% Friday.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 was up 1.2% for the week, ending at 3,022, just below its closing high. On Friday, it briefly traded above the July 26 high of 3,025. The Dow ended the week with a gain of 0.7%, at 26,956, and it remains about 1% below its closing high.\n*****\n> In addition, the earnings calendar remains heavy with about 145 S&P 500 companies releasing earnings, including Alphabet Monday and big oil Exxon Mobil and Chevron Friday. On Wednesday, earnings are expected from Apple, which is setting new highs of its own.\n*****\n> # Big economic reports\n\n> On top of that, November kicks off Friday in what looks to be the most important day for economic data of the new month. Besides the critical monthly employment report, there is the key ISM manufacturing report, expected to show a contraction in manufacturing activity for a third month.\n*****\n> Both reports could be distorted by the GM strike, which is expected to result in an October employment report with fewer than 100,000 jobs. According to Refinitiv, total non farm payrolls are expected to be 90,000, while manufacturing jobs are expected to decline by 50,000. That would include the impact of GM workers, but also the employees of the many suppliers and services that support the car company’s manufacturing operations.\n*****\n> “The jobs number will be big, but the ISM could be bigger. If that turns up, like Markit [PMI] suggested, that could be a big deal,” said Leuthold Group Chief Investment Strategist James Paulsen. On Thursday, Markit flash PMI manufacturing data for October was higher than expected, and still has not shown a contraction.\n*****\n> “If it turns up, I think that’s to affect a lot of people and how they feel about things. That could take on a whole new dimension of what happens to Wall Street earnings estimates,” he said.\n*****\n> Manufacturing data has dragged, due to the impact of tariffs and the trade war, and some big companies have taken a hit as a result, like Caterpillar which on Wednesday reported weaker than expected earnings and sales. Caterpillar also cut its outlook, in large part due to weakness in China. Caterpillar shares were slammed but on Friday, the stock was bouncing back by 3.5%.\n*****\n> # Stocks at ‘inflection point’\n\n> Quincy Krosby, Prudential Financial’s chief market strategist, said the fact Caterpillar was able to come back at the end of the week was a positive for the market, which she says is now entering the late year seasonal period where stocks typically do well. At the same time, she said news for the market looks like it’s about to get “less bad.”\n*****\n> ″″Less bad’ is not a full fledged agreement with China. Less bad is a truce. It means that Dec. 15 extension in tariffs does not happen,” she said, adding the market appears to be at an inflection point with investors expecting an agreement of some type between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping when they meet in November.\n*****\n> ″‘I’m not bullish. I’m not bearish. I’m optimistic. This market has been led by the defensive sectors. You’re starting to see that move into consumer discretionary. It’s telling you the market is seeing growth, albeit it not stellar growth, but when it gets ‘less bad’ you’re going to see that it’s being reflected in this inflection point in the market,” said said. “We’re seeing a move more and more into the cyclical and growth sectors, and by the way, we’re seeing a steepening of the yield curve.”\n*****\n> The yield curve represents the difference between the yields of two different duration Treasury securities. When the curve inverts, the yield on the shorter duration security, in this case the 2-year has become higher than that of say, the 10-year. That is one part of the curve that was temporarily inverted, and if it stayed inverted it would be a recession warning.\n*****\n> The 10-year has been moving higher, and the 1.80% level will be important if the yield can stay above it.\n*****\n> “If it pushes through 1.80, you’re going to take the inversion out, by the bond market, not the Fed,” Paulsen said. Paulsen said it would be a sign of confidence in the economy if yields can push higher.\n*****\n> The Fed taking a pause may add to that sense. “I think most people think one more cut and done,” he said. “The bigger news will be what [Powell] says in that press conference. He can go pretty off script sometimes.”\n*****\n> # ‘Greater optimsim’ in market\n\n> Paulsen said stocks could be in a good period, and earnings news seems to be already priced in. “The data by and large has been okay. You have earnings that are okay, and there’s no sense of imminent recession. It just seems there’s greater optimism,” he said.\n*****\n> Of the approximately 200 S&P companies that reported by Friday morning, more than 78% have beaten on earnings per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to decline by 2% for the third quarter, based on estimates and results from companies that already reported.\n*****\n> Paulsen said there’s some sense in the market that Brexit will not end in a worst case scenario, but it is something to watch in the week ahead as British lawmakers decide whether to hold an election.\n*****\n> Jack Ablin, chief investment officer with Cresset Wealth Advisors, said he thinks Brexit would be a bigger deal than the trade agreement for the world economy, if it goes poorly, with the U.K. leaving the European Union with no deal. “A no deal Brexit is likely to take 2 percentage points off of British growth...It would take 1% off European growth...I think that’s significant,” Ablin said. “I think investors are underplaying it because it’s so binary. It’s hard to position for a binary outcome. If we get some resolution there, to me, that has the biggest impact for the markets.”\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/mMPvzgL.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/qfH6cuI.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/2Fl3u1U.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/d0KYXSh.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mQYD2ay.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fARcwR4.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NPhYaGZ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JwfHb1k.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5DjAHjt.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/aJoKnw0.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/3GQMBSo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/4zFdNBR.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Oj3izCL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/4BShjBk.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Bullish Halloween Trading Strategy Treat Next Week\n\n> Next week provides a special short-term seasonal opportunity, one of the most consistent of the year. The last 4 trading days of October and the first 3 trading days of November have a stellar record the last 25 years. From the tables below:\n* Dow up 19 of last 25 years, average gain 2.1%, median gain 1.4%.\n* S&P up 21 of last 25 years, average gain 2.1%, median gain 1.5%.\n* NASDAQ up 21 of last 25 years, average gain 2.7%, median gain 2.3%.\n* Russell 2000 19 of last 25 years, average gain 2.2%, median gain 2.5%.\n\n> Many refer to our Best Six Months Tactical Seasonal Switching Strategy as the Halloween Indicator or Halloween Strategy and of course “Sell in May”. These catch phrases highlight our discovery that was first published in 1986 in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac that most of the market’s gains are made from October 31 to April 30, while the market goes sideways to down from May through October.\n\n> Since 1950 DJIA is up 7.5% November-April and up only 0.6% May-October. We encouraged folks not to fear Octoberphobia early this month and wait for our MACD Buy Signal which came on October 11. We have been positioning more bullishly since in sector and major U.S. market ETFs and with a new basket of stocks. But the next seven days have been a historically bullish trade.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/7e1e3780903ab0320558e5b3ae4cafa9/3e97f22823802fb9-ff/s500x750/ffa25c2f95af2a97ef6221e68e45ac6440ef27c7.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/aa30c86f2cd7f4fcd6d4b1a15e0fab60/3e97f22823802fb9-94/s500x750/c2b10b503a894dc86252e11a5fb6f2cc5d4db968.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eca76e887e3c4186b3c55ca9206185c2/3e97f22823802fb9-da/s500x750/4a107f95210b6c105423dc027eca75dd1adb3059.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a36c7df7c5263b070c39990b16774d83/3e97f22823802fb9-36/s500x750/e020f6bed981a0daa21ba07242dcdb916340349b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# Normally a top month, November has been lackluster in Pre-Election Years\n\n> November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.\n\n> November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950), NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 2000 (since 1979) month. November is best for S&P 500 (since 1950) and Russell 1000’s (since 1979).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/ef59a01a84a6391160b8624e5d05acf0/795865009b4c2002-94/s400x600/2d11d5ae114446e6162b685da1210ec1c8e83e73.jpg))**\n\n> In pre-election years, November’s performance is noticeably weaker. DJIA has advanced in nine of the last 17 pre-election years since 1950 with an average gain of 0.3%. S&P 500 has been up in 10 of the past 17 pre-election years, also gaining on average a rather paltry 0.3%. Small-caps and techs perform better with Russell 2000 climbing in 6 of the past 10 pre-election years, averaging 1.2%. NASDAQ has been up in 7 of the last 12 pre-election year Novembers with an average 0.9% gain. Contributing to pre-election year November’s weaker performance are nasty declines in 1987, 1991 and 2007.\n\n*****\n\n# Q4 Rally Is Real. Don’t Let 2018 Spook You\n\n> Understandably folks are apprehensive about the perennial fourth quarter rally this year after the debacle that culminated in the Christmas Eve Crumble in 2018. But the history is clear. The fourth quarter is the best quarter of the year going back to 1949, except for NASDAQ where Q1 leads Q4 by 4.5% to 4.0%, since 1971.\n\n> Historically, the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-Year Election Cycle is the three-quarter span from Q4 Midterm Year through Q2 Pre-Election Year, averaging a gain of 19.3% for DJIA and 20.0% for S&P 500 since 1949 and 29.3% for NASDAQ since 1971. Conversely the weakest two-quarter span is Q2-Q3 of the Midterm Year, averaging a loss of -1.2% for DJIA and -1.5% for S&P 500 since 1949 and -5.0% for NASDAQ since 1971.\n\n> Market action was impacted by some more powerful forces in 2018 that trumped (no pun intended) seasonality. Q2-Q3 was up 9.8% for DJIA, 10.3% for S&P and 13.9% for NASDAQ. Q4 was horrible, down -11.8% for DJIA, -14.0% for S&P and -17.5% for NASDAQ.Q1-Q2 of pre-election year, especially Q1 gained all that back.\n\n> Pre-Election year Q4 is still one of the best quarters of the 4-Year Cycle, ranked 5th, for average gains of 2.6% for DJIA and 3.2% for S&P since 1949 and 5.4% for NASDAQ. Additionally, from the Pre-Election Seasonal Pattern we updated in last Friday’s post, you can see how the market tends to make a high near yearend in the Pre-Election Year. So, save some new unexpected outside event, Q4 Market Magic is expected to impress once again this year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dbbf895b45f184b03a00b205d9d5fb01/50dce02940c8c467-9c/s500x750/aa060bb5f968ea0e9de159e18bbf348ab8f21ee0.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 2019 May Be One of the Best Years Ever\n\n> “Everything is awesome, when you’re living out a dream.” The Lego Movie\n\n> As the S&P 500 Index continues to flirt with new record highs, something under the surface is taking place that is making 2019 extremely special. Or dare we say, “awesome”.\n\n> First, let’s look back at last year. 2018 was the first year since 1969 in which both the S&P 500 (stocks) and the 10-year Treasury bond (bonds) both finished the year with a negative return. Toss in the fact that gold and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil were both down last year, and it was one of the worst years ever for a diversified portfolio.\n\n> “As bad as last year was for investors, 2019 is a mirror image, with stocks, bonds, gold, and crude oil all potentially finishing the year up double digits for the first time in history,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, it has been a great year for stocks, bonds, gold, and crude oil. Of course, there are still more than two months to go in 2019, but this year is shaping up to be one of the best years ever for these four important assets.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/great-year-for-assets_1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# An Early Look at Earnings\n\n> We're now in the thick of the Q3 earnings reporting period with 130 companies reporting since just the close last night. As shown in our Earnings Explorer snapshot below, earnings will be in overdrive for the next two weeks before dying down in mid-November.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/explorer.png))**\n\n> Through yesterday's close, 248 companies had reported so far this season, and 75% of them had beaten consensus bottom-line EPS estimates. However, just 63% of stocks have beaten sales estimates, and more companies have lowered guidance than raised guidance. In terms of stock price reaction to reports this season, so far investors have seen earnings as relatively bullish as the average stock that has reported has gained 0.60% on its earnings reaction day. Below we show another snapshot from our Earnings Explorer featuring the aggregate results of this season's reports and a list of the stocks that have reacted the most positively to earnings. Four stocks so far have gained more than 20% on their earnings reaction days -- PETS, BIIB, APHA, and LLNW.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/epsstats.png))**\n\n> We provide clients with a beat-rate monitor on our Earnings Explorer page as well. Below is a chart showing the rolling 3-month EPS and sales beat rates for US companies over the last 5 years. After a dip in the EPS beat rate earlier in the year, we've seen it steadily increase over the last few months up to its current level of 64.46%. That's more than five percentage points above the historical average of 59.37%.\n\n> In terms of sales, 57.87% of companies have beaten top-line estimates over the last 3 months, which is much closer to the historical average than the bottom-line beat rate.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/epsbeatrate.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Banks - On To The Next Test\n\n> It has been a pretty monumental two weeks for the KBW Bank index. Since the close on 10/8, the index has rallied just under 9% as earnings reports from some of the largest US banks received a warm welcome from Wall Street. The index is now once again testing the top-end of its range, one which it has unsuccessfully tested multiple times in the last year. If you think the repeated tests of 3,000 for the S&P 500 over the last 18 months have been dramatic, the current go around with 103 for the KBW Bank Index has been the sixth such test in the last year! We would also note that prior to last year's fourth quarter downturn, the same level that has been acting as resistance for the KBW Bank index was previously providing support.\n\n> In the case of each prior failed break above 103 for the KBW Bank index, sell-offs of at least 5% (and usually 10%+) followed, but one thing the index has going for it even if the sixth time isn't the charm is that just yesterday it broke above its downtrend that has been in place since early 2018. The group has passed one test at least! From here, if we do see a pullback, that former downtrend line should provide support.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2019/10/102319-Banks.png))**\n\n> Turning to the KBW Index's individual components, the table below lists each of the 24 stocks in the index along with how each one has performed since the index's recent low on 10/8 and on a YTD basis (sorted by performance since 10/8).

I hope mah playas on dis sub made up pretty sickly up in tha market dis past week, n' is locked n loaded fo' tha freshly smoked up tradin week ahead.\n\nHere is every last muthafuckin thang you need ta know ta git you locked n loaded fo' tha tradin week beginnin October 28th, 2019.\n\nDa Fed n' Applez earnings will make or break market’s return ta record highs up in tha week ahead - (Source)\nStocks will try up in tha week ahead ta break tha all-time highs set earlier up in tha year as a slew of S&P 500 g-units git set ta report.\n\nStock prices is bumpin up against they highs yo, but whether they can burst all up in n' hold gains may, fo' tha near term, depend on what tha fuck investors hear from Jerome Powell up in tha week ahead.\n\nIn a week stacked wit major events, tha Fed’s two-dizzle meetin is likely ta be tha high point. Da Federal Open Market Committee is sposed ta fuckin make its third quarta point interest rate cut Wednesdizzle afternoon, followed by comments form Fed Chairman Powell. Those comments could be his crazy-ass most blingin message of tha next few months, as investors peep ta peep whether dat schmoooove muthafucka holdz tha door open ta future rate cuts, or signals it’s time ta pause, as some economists expect.\n\n\"Our view is they’ll be done afta all dis bullshit. We’re not expectin a cold-ass lil cut up in December, n' we’re not expectin cuts next year. Shiiit, dis aint no joke. Da economy, up in mah mind, be lookin like it’s stabilizing, n' there should be mo' evidence of dat up in tha next couple weeks. focusin on tha labor market is tha key thang,\" holla'd Drew Matus, chizzle market strategist at MetLife Investment Management. If tha labor market holdz up, expectations fo' rate cuts should decline. \"I do be thinkin tha dissentas is jumpin off bout some shiznit they shouldn’t be cuttin at all.\"\n\nBut Matus’ view is just one of nuff on Wall Street. Right back up in yo muthafuckin ass. Some economists expect another cut up in December, while others expect one or mo' cuts next year, dependin on how tha fuck they view tha economy. Goldman Sachs economists laid up a cold-ass lil case where tha Fed will clearly signal dat it plans ta pause afta Wednesday.\n\nAll of dis could make fo' volatilitizzle up in stocks n' bonds, dependin on which market view prevails up in Powell’s comments, n' you can put dat on yo' toast. \"It’s goin ta be choppy goin tha fuck into tha Fed,\" holla'd Andrew Brenner of Nationizzle Alliance. In tha past week, yieldz was higher wit tha 10-year Treasury yield touchin 1.8% Friday.\n\nDa S&P 500 was up 1.2% fo' tha week, endin at 3,022, just below its closin high. On Friday, it briefly traded above tha July 26 high of 3,025. Da Dow ended tha week wit a bust of 0.7%, at 26,956, n' it remains bout 1% below its closin high.\n\nIn addition, tha earnings calendar remains heavy wit bout 145 S&P 500 g-units releasin earnings, includin Alphabet Mondizzle n' big-ass oil Exxon Mobil n' Chevron Friday. It make me wanna hollar playa! On Wednesday, earnings is expected from Apple, which is settin freshly smoked up highz of its own.\n\nBig economic reports\nOn top of that, November kicks off Fridizzle up in what tha fuck looks ta be da most thugged-out blingin dizzle fo' economic data of tha freshly smoked up month. Besides tha critical monthly employment report, there is tha key ISM manufacturin report, sposed ta fuckin show a cold-ass lil contraction up in manufacturin activitizzle fo' a third month.\n\nBoth reports could be distorted by tha GM strike, which is sposed ta fuckin result up in a October employment report wit fewer than 100,000 thangs fo' realz. Accordin ta Refinitiv, total non farm payrolls is sposed ta fuckin be 90,000, while manufacturin thangs is sposed ta fuckin decline by 50,000. That would include tha impact of GM workers yo, but also tha hommiez of tha nuff suppliers n' skillz dat support tha hoopty company’s manufacturin operations.\n\n\"Da thangs number is ghon be big-ass yo, but tha ISM could be bigger n' shit. If dat turns up, like Markit [PMI] suggested, dat could be a funky-ass big-ass deal,\" holla'd Leuthold Group Chief Investment Strategist Jizzy Paulsen. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. On Thursday, Markit flash PMI manufacturin data fo' October was higher than expected, n' still has not shown a cold-ass lil contraction.\n\n\"If it turns up, I be thinkin that’s ta affect a shitload of playas n' how tha fuck they feel bout thangs. That could take on a whole freshly smoked up dimension of what tha fuck happens ta Wall Street earnings estimates,\" da perved-out muthafucka holla'd.\n\nManufacturin data has dragged, cuz of tha impact of tariffs n' tha trade war, n' some big-ass g-units have taken a hit as a result, like Caterpillar which on Wednesdizzle reported weaker than expected earnings n' sales. Caterpillar also cut its outlook, up in big-ass part cuz of weaknizz up in China. Caterpillar shares was slammed but on Friday, tha stock was bouncin back by 3.5%.\n\nStocks at ‘inflection point’\nQuincy Krosby, Prudential Financial’s chizzle market strategist, holla'd tha fact Caterpillar was able ta come back all up in tha end of tha week was a positizzle fo' tha market, which her big-ass booty say is now enterin tha late year seasonal period where stocks typically do well fo' realz. At tha same time, her big-ass booty holla'd shizzle fo' tha market be lookin like it’s bout ta git \"less bad.\"\n\n″″Less bad’ aint a gangbangin' full fledged agreement wit China. Less shitty be a truce. Well shiiiit, it means dat Dec. 15 extension up in tariffs do not happen,\" her big-ass booty holla'd, addin tha market appears ta be at a inflection point wit investors expectin a agreement of some type between Prezzy Dizzle Trump n' Prezzy Xi Jinpin when they hook up in November.\n\n″‘I’m not bullish. I’m not bearish. I’m optimistic. This market has been hustled by tha defensive sectors. You’re startin ta peep dat move tha fuck into thug discretionary. It’s spittin some lyrics ta you tha market is seein growth, albeit it not stellar growth yo, but when it gets ‘less bad’ you’re goin ta peep dat it’s bein reflected up in dis inflection point up in tha market,\" holla'd holla'd. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! \"We’re seein a move mo' n' mo' tha fuck into tha cyclical n' growth sectors, n' by tha way, we’re seein a steepenin of tha yield curve.\"\n\nDa yield curve represents tha difference between tha yieldz of two different duration Treasury securities. Put ya muthafuckin choppers up if ya feel dis! When tha curve inverts, tha yield on tha shorta duration security, up in dis case tha 2-year has become higher than dat of say, tha 10-year. Shiiit, dis aint no joke. That is one part of tha curve dat was temporarily inverted, n' if it stayed inverted it would be a recession warning.\n\nDa 10-year has been movin higher, n' tha 1.80% level is ghon be blingin if tha yield can stay above dat shit.\n\n\"If it pushes all up in 1.80, you’re goin ta take tha inversion out, by tha bond market, not tha Fed,\" Paulsen holla'd. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! Paulsen holla'd it would be a sign of confidence up in tha economizzle if yieldz can push higher.\n\nDa Fed takin a pause may add ta dat sense. \"I be thinkin most playas be thinkin one mo' cut n' done,\" da perved-out muthafucka holla'd. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! \"Da bigger shizzle is ghon be what tha fuck [Powell] say up in dat press conference yo. Dude can go pretty off script sometimes.\"\n\n‘Greata optimsim’ up in market\nPaulsen holla'd stocks could be up in a phat period, n' earnings shizzle seems ta be already priced in. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. \"Da data by n' big-ass has been aiiight. Yo ass have earnings dat is aiiight, n' there’s no sense of imminent recession. I aint talkin' bout chicken n' gravy biatch. Well shiiiit, it just seems there’s pimped outa optimism,\" da perved-out muthafucka holla'd.\n\nOf tha approximately 200 S&P g-units dat reported by Fridizzle morning, mo' than 78% have beaten on earnings per share, accordin ta I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Earnings is sposed ta fuckin decline by 2% fo' tha third quarter, based on estimates n' thangs up in dis biatch from g-units dat already reported.\n\nPaulsen holla'd there’s some sense up in tha market dat Brexit aint gonna end up in a most shitty case scenario yo, but it is suttin' ta peep up in tha week ahead as British lawmakers decizzle whether ta hold a erection.\n\nJack Ablin, chizzle investment fool wit Cresset Wealth Advisors, holla'd tha pimpin' muthafucka be thinkin Brexit would be a funky-ass bigger deal than tha trade agreement fo' tha ghetto economy, if it goes skankyly, wit tha U.K. leavin tha European Union wit no deal. It aint nuthin but tha nick nack patty wack, I still gots tha bigger sack. \"A no deal Brexit is likely ta take 2 cementage points off of British growth...It would take 1% off European growth...I be thinkin that’s significant,\" Ablin holla'd. Y'all KNOW dat shit, muthafucka! \"I be thinkin investors is underplayin it cuz it’s so binary. It’s hard ta posizzle fo' a funky-ass binary outcome. If we git some resolution there, ta me, dat has tha freshest impact fo' tha markets.\"", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "wtf", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Meth", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "And found a bloomberg terminal", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "If you write a generalized version of that mega post, I'll add it to the automod.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I came from 4chan", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "You are a god among men.
