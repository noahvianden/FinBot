{"title": "I'm an astrophysicist (read: data-scientist) and I perform my own (simple) stock analyses: comments welcome! (March 14, 2019)", "selftext": "This is my first post here, and hopefully not my last! If the community finds this useful, I'd be happy to continue posting (perhaps daily?).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExplanation: my approach is based on simple moving averages (SMA). Typical analysts use either the 50-day or 200-day SMA, but there is value in averaging over other periods as well. My approach is to run a loop from 200 to 5 days, and for each period compute the SMA, it's derivative, and second derivative. I then plug in today's date, and average the current SMA and its derivatives (with equal weights, although this could be changed in the future). The average derivative is essentially the stock's \"velocity\" (in %/day), and the average 2nd derivative is its \"acceleration\" (%/day\\^2). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor buying/selling stocks, I look mainly at the velocity (avg d in the following table) to define my strategy, and remove those with negative acceleration. For options, I tend to look further into the future and utilize the acceleration over the velocity to get an idea of where the stock will be headed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations on financials, etc. It is simply based on the history of each ticker. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite ticker added, just let me know.  \n\n\nCheers!  \n\n\nDisclosure: I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list. Yesterday I bought HEXO, PLUG, LTC, ENPH, and SNAP. I'm holding CRON and not adding to my position due to the negative acceleration, but may change that opinion in the future.

It's a Hedge Fund. They've used weather data and other seemingly unrelated data and they were like the first to use quants. They even use linguistics data and fucking astronomy... Their returns are insane. We're talking *consistantly* above 70% returns YOY.\n\nYou will have likely heard of Robert Mercer, who is Trump's billionaire that forced Bannon and Kellyanne Conway onto the Trump campaign and forced them in the White House. This is where his money come from. In fact, I think like 4 or 5 of their people are the top 4 or 5 political donors in the whole country. I think Mercer alone spent $30m in 2016 and I'm damn near certain they used their quants and data to advise the Trump campaign to get Michigan and Wisconsin, while Hillary was in fucking Arizona and Texas... There is going to be so much reading material from this election after these investigations and their fallout is done.\n\nThere are *strange* reports and people working for them. I seem to remember weird screaming fights and physical fights being reported there all the time and something weird about twins- I don't remember if they were part of a study they used data in or had an abnormal amount of twin hires... I mean it sounds like a tv show that is so dramatic and too odd to be true. But it's producing these 70-80% returns consistantly and made them all billions and billions of dollars personally.\n\nIf you're into dealing with data, systems, and coding this could be something that should be your main gig. I think one of the founders of RT is an astrophysicist or an astronomer or something. Something with stars. I'd think about this more and in closed circles. If that sounds interesting to you, I'd start a slack group or a private subreddit with people from different industries in it to gather data and in return you could share your work. I'm an environmental consultant working in urban foresty. I can get you data on an awful lot of green data and upcoming stuff that is public information that no one cares to pay attention to outside the field.\n\nFor example, the person at the USDA who is in charge of the Gypsy Moth funds and plans who has been doing that successfully for decades is about to retire along with a bunch of other people and they're going to lose all their institutional memory as a group. Their budgets are being cut on top of that. So more oak trees are going to die in a very specific line from Wisconsin, into Illinois, across Ohio and I forget where it comes out on the other side of Ohio. Do an image search of Gypsy Moth Damage and spread over time. Instead of shrinking or staying the same like it has, it's about to start getting much much worse. I don't know how to turn data like that into market decisions though. It could get as bad as EAB has and continues to be which is a fucking national fucking dissaster that the news doesn't cover. Had you known about that, which I discovered and reported several of the first infections sites in counties from Michigan, across Indiana, and into Illinois. If I had told you how bad this was and was goign to be, maybe you could have made a fortune shorting somethign to do with baseball bats- they are/were only made of Ash or metal. I'm not sure what they're using now, but they will have had to of switched to an alternative like 5 years ago.\n\nI'd be happy to share some critical information like that if you organized a group that I got to benefit from. And there is a lot of this kind of news. For real google image search gypsy moth devestation. That's what every site looks like **with good and proactive measures**. Now imagine them with that lost experience and cut funds (they spray a bacteria from planes called bT).

I guess you could say that the hypothesis is that future moves are (on average) predictable based on the stock's recent history.

A sine wave is a nice model for a stock, because with sharp upward movement often comes rapid downward pressure (and vice versa) as people try to sell highs and buy lows. I've tried an algorithm that 1) fits a polynomial up to 3rd order, 2) subtracts the polynomial, and fits a sine wave to the residuals, then adds this to the polynomial model, 3) repeats for up to 16 additional wave function fits to the residuals. This method can predict arbitrary dates in the future, but the solutions are highly degenerate and significantly change depending on how far back the data goes, and how many waves are included (note: each sine function introduces four free parameters). Here's an example for FB: [https://imgur.com/6auxGbz](https://imgur.com/6auxGbz). The dotted lines are linear fits to different periods of time (first order polynomial fit better than higher), and the blue lines are the different models computed with different amounts of data and different numbers of waves. You can see there is quite a spread: the symbols show the current stock price (red), model predictions one week out (blue), and their average (purple). The text at the top shows some details about the model predictions. 50 and 200 SMA are in orange and green, respectively. While the average prediction is that FB will go up 2.4% next week, the uncertainty is 15% (estimated as the standard deviation of the individual model predictions), so I would not call this a good pick based on these models.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs for machine learning, this is an interesting idea that I've thought about, but haven't tried to implement.

Most of the news and responses we’ve heard have come from Boeing themselves.

Stuff like this can have a domino effect and suddenly Boeing is facing various lawsuits, regardless of how legitimate they are.\n\nThere is also the concern that Boeing customers further cave to consumer fears and feelings. Boeing has quite a bit riding on this particular program and orders being delayed, renegotiated, or even canceled could have a dramatic impact on the stock. We’ve seen some of this to lesser degree already but if customers feel pressure and react then it could absolutely get worse.\n\nThere is also the chance of politics becoming further involved.
