Even if it means taking a loss on the sales of that product or getting stuck with unwanted inventory.\n\nAlong those lines, when people talk about \"demand problems\" for Tesla, the main concern is not whether Tesla is able to move cars *at all*, it's whether Tesla is able to move cars while actually making money.  This is where the price cuts come in - they have infinite demand at *some* price point, but can they get the proper margins?\n\nThose two points are what people asking about demand are concerned about.  Production numbers don't enter into it.  There are two main questions: how much of that production have they actually sold, and are they getting stuck with lots of surplus inventory?  And (this is the much more important question imo) are there acceptable margins at the price points that there is demand for?\n\nI think there are no solid answers to either of those at this point, so everyone's just left speculating.
