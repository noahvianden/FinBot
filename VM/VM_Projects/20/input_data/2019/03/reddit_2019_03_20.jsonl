More importantly though imo is Disney+, which will be Disney's version of Netflix. Disney has a ton of content, there is good reason to believe that Disney+ will be a success.\n\nHowever as other users have pointed out, it may be better to wait for the stock price to drop. Disney isn't a very volatile stock anyways and it hasn't moved past $115 for a long time, however it dipped to about $100 a share with the stock market correction. That could very well happen again, in which case that would be a better entry point.\n\nHowever I bought the stock at $116 back in December right before the stock market correction *shrug* . Yeah it was bad timing, but it happens to all of us eventually. I still own my Disney stock and see no reason to sell it.
