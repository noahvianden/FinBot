Not deleting it so I can reference it later.\n\nI think he's referring to the battery cost, period, compared to the cost of an ICE engine and gas tank. The cost of the metals that go into the batteries are, and will probably always be, more expensive than the powertrain of ICE cars.\n\nTherefore, the upfront cost of an EV will be higher than an ICE car, period. The raw materials are simply more expensive.\n\nThis was brought up by an analyst on the Q4 call. Here's the question, and Tesla's response.\n\n>**Toni Sacconaghi -- Sanford C. Bernstein -- Analyst**\n\n>Yes. Thank you. You've talked repeatedly about the need to drive down costs, which, in turn, drives the elasticity of demand for cars. And I'm wondering if you can talk about how much of a price differential between the $50,000 Model 3 and the $35,000 Model 3 is structural, meaning that powertrain costs for EVs are just structurally higher than they are for internal combustion engine cars and where you think that difference is today and when that is no longer a factor? \n\n>So is -- or maybe said another way, is the bigger driver in getting to lower costs and lower -- and more affordability on the Model 3, is it really around the powertrain and getting that at parity? Or is it everything else about Tesla not being as efficient as other manufacturers that is causing the higher price right now? And have I follow-up, please.\n\n>**Jerome Guillen -- President**\n\n>It's both. It's both, the vehicle and both the powertrain. So I split my time half and half between the Gigafactory and here, and there is opportunities in both, yes.\n\n>**Deepak Ahuja -- Chief Financial Officer**\n\n>But I think the bigger point is that, yes, there is cost reduction opportunities out, but the bigger point is it's not that our cost is higher than a gas-powered or an internal combustion engine.\n\n>**Martin Viecha -- Senior Director of Investor Relations**\n\n>I think what Toni meant is with the battery pack, as in battery pack as well as the powertrain together, are more expensive than an engine.\n\n>**Elon Musk -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer**\n\n>Yes. That's true.\n\n>**Toni Sacconaghi -- Sanford C. Bernstein -- Analyst**\n\n>And how big do you think that delta is today? And when it's -- do you think of it as being kind of $10,000, $11,000 for that pack plus powertrain for an electric vehicle and maybe $5,000 or $6,000 for an internal combustion engine car? And is that sort of the order of magnitude? And where do you see those getting much more aligned just sort of given the lives of where you think cell and pack costs are going?\n\n>**Elon Musk -- Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer**\n\n>Well, the -- I think it's important to bear in mind is because of electricity is quite a bit less than the cost of gasoline, especially in Europe or in California or China, basically almost everywhere except, say, the middle of the United States, where the cost of gasoline is very expensive and electricity is far cheaper. The -- so that factors in to the cost of ownership pretty significantly. It's on -- sort of going on the order of $50 to $100 a month depending upon how much somebody drives.

{"title": "Some thoughts about Ray Dalio's \"Big Debt Crises\"", "selftext": "(If you're reading this on your phone, put it in landscape mode before clicking on the links - easier to view the graphs that way).\n\nI've been reading Ray Dalio's new book, [Big Debt Crises](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Debt-Crises-Ray-Dalio/dp/1732689806/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=). Really interesting stuff, particularly the first section where Dalio describes the archetypal debt cycle.  The following section piqued my interest (emphases added):\n\n> Early on in the top, some parts of the credit system suffer, but others remain robust, so it isn't clear that the economy is weakening. ... The fastest rate of tightening typically comes **about five months prior to the top of the stock market.** ... Unemployment is normally at cyclical lows and inflation rates are rising. ... Short rates typically peak **just a few months before the top in the stock market.**\n\nThis mention of short rates peaking a few months before the stock market caused me to mash some data together from previous stock market peaks. Here's what I found.\n\n[2000: Dotcom peak](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTLj46YjplQ1F4mh9z9MV-O0sej_whYYGSQ8IOdA9Y7RRxVS77fgvZbU3LbTCLQGT35wp4FtAwhlORM/pubhtml?gid=436219758&single=true)\n\nThe 2 year rate peaked in May 2000, and then the S&P500 peaked 5 months later in October.  Actually if you look at the chart, the SPX really had a double peak - first in March, then there was a selloff and the 2 year peaked, and then SPX rallied to hit the all-time high 7 months later.\n\n\"But what about the short rate dropping in 1998?\" you might object.  \"The market rallied for 2 years after that.  That's prolly our future.\"  Maybe.  The Fed cut interest rates in response to the LTCM failure, which was a different scenario from where we are today.  In any case, those rate cuts fueled the bubble through 2000, and when it popped, the market ultimately landed below even the 1998 levels.\n\n***\n\n[2007: Housing bubble peak](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vShQ0i0Z19jTwwgrijOuc3VkPBqFTW2DtocbXlnQgJgwFAun1gU9UWJniH3I0gW5Mch5M83-5Jh6Xna/pubhtml?gid=1055674560&single=true)\n\nIt's hard to see exactly where the 2 year peaked in this chart, since it stayed pretty flat for so long.  But it finally fell by more than 60 basis points from June - August 2007, so perhaps we say the peak was in June 2007.  The market swooned after June 07, only to rally to all-time highs 4 months later in October 07.  The rest is history.\n\n***\n\n[2019: the Everything bubble](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTxB_VK3iOkTs_js3S3zkEAaekZQi25qy7SAGyAwDz02ntj_3XJkBnRX33TEC0fv3ugcAlD3hPbgAup/pubhtml?gid=536551219&single=true)\n\nThe 2 year rate peaked at 2.94% in early November 2018.  The greatest rate of Fed rate increases ended in December, with Powell's last hike before his dovish flip-flop.  We can see that the 2 year in the past few days was trading around 2.23%, a drop of 71 basis points from the November peak.  And just like 2000 and 2007, the stock market has rallied back furiously from a correction.\n\nIf Mr. Dalio's prediction about the short rate peaking ~5 months before the stock market top holds true, then we probably have another 2-3 months of rocketing towards all-time highs.  What comes after that is anyone's guess.\n\n***\n\nSome counterexamples:\n\n* [1989](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR6atCzpOpSFE8LQdQjeRnK3zeuVYOWM8d_w8gpOOZ2ctkJEahRFBUszqgv7NlWalocMbeK8UbDyIhJ/pubhtml?gid=1798556882&single=true) - short rates peak, recession happens, but market doesn't crash\n* [1978-82](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vToHjG1eXVq6Ofww7FYWkWhfYugQa2mkaZDaiIr2FhG8olGQ5jUvdhFErE4FQ6CcagX31oShoS_RL-A/pubhtml?gid=1421794356&single=true) - this chart is pretty bonkers, so I'm not sure if it's useful at all.  \n\nFor both of these counterexamples, it was a very different interest rate and inflation environment, so I'm not sure they're useful here.\n\nI don't have data going back to 1929, but looking at [this low-res chart](https://newworldeconomics.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/USinterestrates1919-19412.jpg), it appears the 3-6month rate peaked in Q1 or Q2 1929.

Twenty seven (27) of these occurred within a brief discussion of the Chinese role and their 2008/2009 participation/funding of the American \"Great Recession\" which I'll also refer to later on in this post, with a discussion of Hank Paulson's frequent trips to Beijing aptly described in the prologue of Richard McGregor's wonderful work \"The Party\"....but I digress.  The other lone reference to \"China\" benignly pertained to the 2015 Chinese Stock Market crash, when comparing indicators present in past bubbles as a validation of the data.  Again, Ray does not take even one page to discuss the decade long, greatest money printing, debt build up in history, currently happening on mainland China.
