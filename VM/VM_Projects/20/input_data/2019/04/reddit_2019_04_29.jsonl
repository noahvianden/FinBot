If it's $16 at expiration, you lose about 25% of your investment.\n\nA common mistake with VIX options is assuming that they are measured against spot VIX. They are not. The VIX contract that you have above is the October contract. The October VIX contract is currently sitting at about 17, not 13 like spot VIX. This is why your option is about $4....spot + $4 = \\~October future.
