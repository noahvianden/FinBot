If that happens today, yes. If it happens in a month, maybe. If it happens in a few months, probably not. If it's $16 at expiration, you lose about 25% of your investment.\n\nA common mistake with VIX options is assuming that they are measured against spot VIX. They are not. The VIX contract that you have above is the October contract. The October VIX contract is currently sitting at about 17, not 13 like spot VIX. This is why your option is about $4....spot + $4 = \\~October future.

Start here even if it's not about finance.) \n\nOne up on Wallstreet by Peter Lynch\n(The best book to start with on finance.) \n\nLittle book of common sense investing by John Bogle. (A must read to understand what you are up against. The best book on investment fallacies and index funds by Bogle himself) \n\n\nOther great reads in no particular order:\n\nBuilt to Last by Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras\n(a fantastically researched work on how companies are built to last forever) \n\nGood to great by Jim Collins and Jerry I. Porras\n(In my eyes the best book written on business. How do companies built into something truly great.) \n\nStocks in the Long run by Jeremy Seagal\n\nLittle book that Builds Wealth by Pat Dorsey\n\nUncommon Sense for the Thoughtful Investor by Howard Marks \n\nA Random Walk Down Wallstreet by Burton Malkiel (the book I personally started with. A great book on fallacies in investing. I used to have it at the top, but it has some slight flaws and Bogles work is simply better and more modern) \n\nThe Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham\n(A snap must-read, however not a good place to start. Mr. Market can be dry and hard to follow for the newbies.) \n\nThe Warren Buffet Way by Robert Hagstrom\n(A great book if you want a modern view on traditional ideas, as well as a focus on Buffet) \n\n Security Analysis by Ben Graham\n (A textbook but a great one. Read this one if you start to understand but still can't answer the question \"how to people set price targets or valuate companies\") \n\nLast but not least, I'd get through all of Warren Buffets shareholder letters written for the Birkshire shareholders. It's insightful and gives great insight on what matters when looking at companies according to one of the greatest men of all time. \n\nNot a book, however a great place to read is investiopedia.
