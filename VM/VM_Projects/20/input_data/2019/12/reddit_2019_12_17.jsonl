{"title": "Thoughts on “Feature Complete” Autopilot’s Impact on the Stock", "selftext": "TL;DR: I think Tesla stock will 2-3x (even if it’s just temporarily) on the release of “Feature Complete” Autopilot. Mostly meaning autopilot on city streets. \n\n\nRight now Waymo has a valuation around 100 billon dollars on nothing more than belief that they are the front runner in autonomous vehicles. (That’s down from 175 billion when they really seemed like they were the front runner); GM Cruise even has a valuation of about 19 billion, seen only as a contender.\n\nMost people still have written off Tesla as a contender, but unlikely to be a leader because they don’t use LIDAR in their vehicles. Most of their progress to date can be written off using this fact as being good enough for semi autonomy but never going to reach full autonomy. In this way Tesla’s fleet of hundreds of thousands of autopilot capable vehicles is discounted as not being suitable for actual full autonomy. \n\nAt some point that public perception is going to flip, and then the value add of Tesla as the front runner in autonomous tech will drive the stock to 2-3x on that perception. \n\nI think the turning point will be when Tesla releases autopilot on city streets. Even with it being mostly buggy and lots of disengagements, this is going to push public perception and make it easy for people to make the mental leap of; Yes it’s not perfect, but I can see this being refined over time because it does everything now. \n\nNever mind the actual technical reality of going from lots of disengagement’s to level 5 “perfect”, if Tesla pushes that level of autonomy to hundreds of thousands of cars, that you yourself could go out and buy right now and use anywhere...

They just need to find the states/localities that allow it with the least friction, get a lot of videos on YouTube and stories in social media, and the rest of the country will be calling their representatives demanding it.\n\nI used to be more optimistic about Feature Complete and pessimistic about regulatory issues.  Now I'm almost the opposite.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I -really- hope there are substantial leaps in performance coming... things that aren't currently safe enough to start using and lull people into a false sense of security.  If not... well... that \"just a matter of time\" will be a LONG time.\n\nFrankly, I don't see a remotely fast path from the current rate of progress to something you could let handle even 90% of city street driving.  There needs to be huge sets of new capability and I hope they're on the way.  I'd guess the improvements from the beginning up to now seem like 20% at best of what's needed (pulling a number out of my ass of course).  Smart summon and autopark aren't even using lines in parking lots yet.  Safely handling stop signs and lights regularly hidden by tree limbs and big trucks, proper sign interpretation, there's a lot.  Handling the finer nuances of highway driving seem WAY easier in comparison and that's really not progressing very fast.  (At least for the timelines we're told to expect. Leaving Feature Complete aside, I'm a pretty happy guy every time there's a noticeable step forward)  I'll be really happy when autopilot avoids driving in people's blind spots, for an example of one thing that should be a low hanging fruit.  (solving phantom braking is unfortunately really really hard)\n\nI'm hoping stop signs and street lights are being dynamically learned network-wide (whenever a car sees one, it updates the map) instead of depending on a static database getting occasional updates.  The maps FSD currently uses for exits and lane changes is pretty spotty over here in Houston.  (Well, it was, it may have been updated)  I can't imagine how much more information that is to get right and keep updated for the small streets.\n\nThe stop sign stop light warning thing recently is particularly disappointing.  Why release something like that if it working seems to be the exception not the rule?  I'm very much hoping that warning is just a \"well, it'll help a little, throw it in\" side effect while they're adding the system that is dynamically learning where stops are to bootstrap the database.  It's almost the only thing that makes sense, unless I get really pessimistic on FSD.\n\nSo, personally I'm just expecting good things with more production, some secret sauce battery tech, a big ramp in stationary storage, maybe solar roof.  Feature complete FSD will just have to be a very pleasant surprise when it eventually happens.  The stock should still see some substantial gains just in the next 3-6 months with all the cool stuff coming down the pipe.\n\nI'm loving the car, loving the updates... and I can see how Feature Complete might be soon (if they're just hiding huge blocks of functionality that all have to work 99.99999% before they're ready)... but if they're not hiding such things from us we have a long ass way to go.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I made a similar post about this last week, and I don't get it either.\n\nI'm absolute shit at modeling this sort of thing, but let me throw out a very simple model for sake of discussion:\n\n* $3T TAM for Robotaxi (a number that's been thrown around)\n\n* 3 companies get there (could be any of Waymo/Tesla/Mobileye/GM/Apple/etc.). Each have an equal share of the $3T (for simplicity)\n\n* Of those 3 companies, there's a 33% chance Tesla is one of them (made up number, but not unreasonable)\n\n* Assumption that, today, Tesla is 20% complete for Robotaxi (another made up number, but not unreasonable)\n\nUsing these very broad and rough assumptions, we get what should be Tesla's Robotaxi valuation, today:\n\n$3T * 33% * 33% * 20% = $65B\n\nSo assuming you don't think Robotaxi is an impossible problem, and that it's a matter of when, not if, shouldn't Tesla's FSD be valued somewhere around here?

The percentage of people who are willing to pay 100k for FSD (even from a taxi business perspective) is much lower than those who pay for Tesla FSD and therefore will have a smaller market share of the self driving sector.\n\nEdit: why pay 100k to retrofit a Waymo system into a vehicle when you can have a FSD electric counterpart for half the price?
