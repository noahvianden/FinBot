If there was a recession (as people expected in 2019/2020 until recently) then Tesla would not be able to raise money and they would be done even if their cars were legit. \n\nFrom the automotive side you have to realize when Tesla started electric cars were a joke. It was a completely unrealistic idea. Tesla changed the paradigm with the roadster. Even then people didn’t think you could make a practical vehicle but with dropping costs of batteries and improved manufacturing they did it. \n\nAs touched on elsewhere (Hyperchange mentions these issues a lot) there are a lot of blinders that people in the auto industry wear. The first issue is that if they make EVa they will lose money or make very little (former head of Renault/Nissan didn’t want people to buy Nissan Leafs because they would lose money). So in order for someone like Ford to transition to EVs they have to give up the juicy profits on SUVs and trucks and move to something with small profit margin. On top of that even if they make an EV no car dealer wants to sell an EV.

Was the screen that big of a part of the total cost of a laptop? Nope. Screen makers overpriced LCD screens for desktop computers for a really long time because they already had factories up and running pouring out millions of shitty 17\" CRT screens, and switching the market over to LCD too quickly would lead to enormous writeoffs.

{"title": "WSB Predicts Dec-2018 Volatility", "selftext": "Can WSB predict the future? Narrator: They can't. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsing data in the comment section of every WSB  posts, I attempted to extract the number of CALLS and PUTS WSB was placing on a given day between Oct 2018 and Jan 2019. The Orange area is number of CALLS and PUTS WSB was talking about. If Orange is up, then WSB was buying more calls, if Orange was down, WSB was buying more puts. Then I plotted the daily movement of SPY (blue line). Blue line up = BULL market, Blue line down = BEAR market. \n\nIn general, I found that despite WSB concentrated autistic power, WSB lacked the ability to predict the movement of SPY. At best, WSB could follow the movement of SPY, but most of the time WSB lagged behind SPY a few days. \n\nAdditionally, some of you probably lost your asses in Oct-2018. Lots of CALL options in a BEAR market. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xw1oivzmag641.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=a59e7cf5cd9237474e2124d1190621d041e2f2cd", "id": "eerd5n", "created_utc": 1577138641.0, "score": 78, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": ">WSB lacked the ability to predict the movement of SPY.\n\nYou mean those FD's not a good idea ?!", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "What is FD I just hear Freedom Dividend", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Fish dicks.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I think you are giving us too much credit so let us know what we should do", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "But I want to believe", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Do not be mistaken, *wsb has the ability to see the future.*\n\nIf the future is 5 days in the past.", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Now can you please do for this quarter?

You should not buy yet but you can start to slowly build your position for a small selloff coming next year. \n\nWe are not going to have the big crash or whatever they will try to scare you into, but we will have the \"pullback\" down closer to SPY 300-310 at some point.\n\nIf it continues up further, spy will only fall back to 320 if it is at 340 etc.\n\nSo, here is what you will need to do:\n\nNotice Vix is at 12.80. We used to be as low as 10-ish. Therefore we will go back down to 10-ish again probably when they announce more good trade war news.\n\nThat is the time you will start to really load up on calls on Vix. You will have to be patient and wait for us to get closer to 10.\n\nNow notice how options are only dated out till June 2020? So that means they will price in the pullback of the market.\n\nWhich means we will only see some smaller pullbacks and I want you to notice there is only open Interest at strike 50 at highest for the longest dates expiration.\n\nI want you to go through the options chain and you'll probably notice like I did that 15 on the Vix seems very very important for some reason. \n\nTherefore I determine we will only rise to around 15-25 on the vix between now and the middle of 2020.\n\nMake your volatility trade accordingly.\n\nThe grape is back.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Welcome back.
