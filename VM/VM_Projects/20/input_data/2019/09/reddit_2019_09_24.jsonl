If you're struggling to become a \"trader\" listen closely.. I trade for a fund and here is some solid advice from someone who does this for a living. Plus, I've had a few whiskey's so I'm more inclined to offer advice than I normally am.. Don't judge me - it's Friday night here..\n\nI'm probably going to receive flak for this from \"traders\", but again, I get paid full-time to do this shit so either listen or don't. I don't care.\n\nBasically, I'm sick and tired of watching a bunch of fakers offer a bunch of fake advice to a bunch of rookies trying their best to learn how to trade. I was taught by a mentor who had been doing this shit for 30+ years and I wouldn't be where I am today if it wasn't for him so I want to pay it forward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRule #1: Risk Management.\n\nThis is THE only way to make money. The best FX-specific funds in the world are right no more than 60-70% of the time each month AT BEST. Some are only right 40% of the time and still make money.. HOW? Risk management. Risk only a % of each trade and trade like a sniper- take only the most high probability setups and and move your stop once it goes in your direction. If it reverts and stops you out, it means you're wrong and you don't want to be in the trade anyway!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRule #2: Have a target\n\nYes, the turtle traders \"rode the trend\".. but they also traded in an era where once a derivative broke out of a range it kept going. Now days you have false breaks/fakeouts/washouts, sideways action etc. If you don't have a target, how do you know where to get out? Don't worry if you get out way too early - as long as you get your profit. Which brings me to;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRule #3: Don't get FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)\n\nDon't chase a trade. Period. If you miss the entry, who cares. You're trading a market that's open 24/5. There's always another opportunity. On the contrary, if you get out of a trade too early - who cares!? You got your profit, now let it run and look for a reversal. OR, if if consolidates, look for another move in the same direction. DON'T GET CAUGHT UP ON WHAT-IF'S!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRule #4: Stay Zen\n\nThis sounds hippy AF but trading will take your mind to dark places you didn't even know existed. Stay zen. A full loss? No problem. 4 losses in a row. No problem. This is part of trading. Stay zen and keep your emotions at the door. All strategies will experience a draw-down. If you don't want that and you don't like losing then you're in the wrong game. You NEED to be able to handle losses.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRule #5: Make your own analysis\n\nDon't listen to \"hot tips\", analysis or anything from other sources. And please, for the love of god, DON'T PAY FOR TRADE ALERTS!!!! DYOR (Do Your Own Research), make your own analysis/bias and stick to it. This includes ignoring the \"pro's\". No one is right 100% of the time - if you go against the \"experts\" who's to say it's not the one time they're wrong!? I once held long a Euro trade when every news source in the world devalued the Euro... I was right, they were wrong - that was one of my largest monthly commissions that month.. I also once held a crude trade when everyone, including CNBC was talking about tanking crude prices - I made 10% on my portfolio that month..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRule #6: Get realistic\n\nOh, you've got $1,500 to trade with? Yeah.. you won't be trading full-time next year. Sorry. It doesn't work like that. Anyone claiming to make 100% of their portfolio in a few months is lying. Either that, or they have BUT they won't keep it up. If they do, they'll go down in history as the best trader in the world. The average FX-specific fund averages 4-7% per month. At my fund, we aim for 5-10% per month. This is top 1% in terms of \"funds\" / \"professional traders\". If you're a retail trader you can probably make adjustments to trade a little differently and maybe improve your performance. But again, if you have $1,500 to trade, don't expect it to be $200,000 in 12 months. That's not how it works. Why do it then? Well, all you need to do is beat government bonds (4.75% .. ?) and you've made a \"successful investment\". How do people become rich from trading then? .. well, they manage money of course.. if you manage $1,500,000 and make 7% and keep a commission, you'll earn far more than 10% on a $1,500 account..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRule #7: STOP LOOKING FOR THE HOLY GRAIL !!! It DOESN'T exist !\n\nWant proof? Fine.. I have gone through and taken examples of how it doesn't matter what strategy you have, you CAN be successful. So, here are SEVEN different strategies on the SAME CHART (gold) that are all profitable. The point being that in the same bullish move it doesn't matter what strategy you use, there are multiple opportunities to enter.\n\nStrategy 1:\n\n![img](wrwl1170xcx21)\n\nStrategy 2:\n\n![img](fx9gqma3xcx21)\n\nStrategy 3:\n\n![img](8tli4yv5xcx21)\n\nStrategy 4:\n\n![img](grbcy2n7xcx21)\n\nStrategy 5:\n\n![img](98siamy8xcx21)\n\nStrategy 6:\n\n![img](i3fjz2taxcx21)\n\nStrategy 7:\n\n![img](thgudhwcxcx21)\n\nRule #8: Stick to your strategy\n\nThis is important. If you encounter a string of losses - DON'T CHANGE YOUR STRATEGY. Just because you're going through a drawdown doesn't mean your strategy no longer works. This is where risk management comes in.. if you're only risking 2% per trade you can sustain a drawdown.. if you're punting at 10% per trade you're quickly going to burn out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRule 9: Stay true to your analysis\n\nYou're either right or you're wrong. If you're in a trade and it goes your way then reverts, are you going to close or hold? Once you enter a trade you shouldn't be \"guessing\" you should know \"it's going to go to here\" - you're either right or you're wrong. Don't be scared by a simple pull-back.\n\nFor example, in the situation below, if you enter where it says entry and you expect it to reach your profit target.. would you close when you see the choppy action in the red box? A rookie would get scared and close. A professional would hold knowing that they're right and it will eventually hit their profit. If it doesn't, it means they're wrong and that's what their stop is for - the most they're willing to risk. If you're never willing to take a full loss, you'll never be willing to take a full win.\n\n![img](lk818xn28dx21)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRule #10: Find your style\n\nAre you wanting freedom? Then don't scalp. I spend no more than 10-15hrs per week looking at charts. That's how I like it. I won't want to be like some of my colleagues where they left a full-time job only to.. look at a chart full-time.. What's the point!?\n\nBut hey, if you're into that stuff and you like watching each tick, then good luck to you. If you're new to forex, start on a daily or 4hr then work your way down to intraday. Most strategies can be slightly altered from a daily chart to suit a 5min chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion\n\nThere's some good reading for ya. I'm now more than tipsy so should probably go drink some water. If you have any questions, ask away. Don't expect a quick reply.\n\nRemember, it takes years to learn this shit.

There is way less volume in the secondary market, which is where you would resell your treasury bonds if you're an entity that is not the US Treasury.

This is undesirable to the Fed as it would fuck with their carefully set interest rates, and undesirable to the American people who in general do not enjoy recessions.\n\nThus the repo market is born (I think it was 2001 so it just turned legal this year but I could be wrong). The whole theory behind forward repo is about maintaining interest rates and daily monetary supply by giving banks a facility to temporarily exchange off-the-run debt for on-the-run debt or reserves.

And that $500 billion is likely including the primary market, where most of this debt is bought and sold. Again, banks can't sell their old treasuries on the primary market so this does not help them.
