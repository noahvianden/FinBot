I'm not sure how important that could end up being.\n\nAs to arbitrage between the prices on these markets: usually all of that is covered by algos, and usually if there's any *apparent* arbitrage opportunity when looking at price charts it's usually just a wide bid/ask spread artifact, not a real trade-able source of income...\n\nI believe what is missing in the discussions below is how each retail broker is handling NASDAQ transactions for European customers:\n\n- **FX expenses**: If your account is EUR denominated, and you do an USD denominated transaction on NASDAQ, then your broker is going to exchange your Euros into Dollars, and will buy you shares. The exchange rate matters to the total transaction cost, and there's quite a few retail brokers that will add a 1-2% spread to FX exchange rates. But typically you can open a USD denominated account as well, which avoids these FX costs entirely if you do swing trading - only have an FX cost the first time of transferring your Euros to Dollars.\n- **Margin requirements and costs**: if you have a margin account and buy a leveraged position for short-term trading, then you'll often have different margin requirements between markets, and different interest rates for the margin used. For example Euro interest rates are basically zero right now, while the Fed Funds Rate is 2%. Depending on how your broker is charging for margin, it might matter to your transaction costs whether you borrow margin in Euros or Dollars.\n\nThe exact costs of these items are complex and disclosure is spread out and not necessarily easy to find for each broker, there's often hidden fees as well, so one solution is to measure it: perform a \"test purchase\" of a single share on both of the exchanges, hold it for a week and sell it, and have a good look at the detailed transaction costs.\n\nAlso note that the actual **volume** of the TSLA secondary market in Europe isn't necessarily indicative of its cost basis: if arbitrageurs are maintaining a tight bid/ask spread (plus a small fee) during NASDAQ trading hours even if comparatively few people are trading through a given exchange, it might still have useful liquidity for retail sized orders.\n\nI'd also like to note that there's a few German exchanges that are trading TSLA outside regular NASDAQ pre-market and after-market trading hours. The spreads are typically horrendous, but you might be able to take advantage of super positive (or super negative) news before NASDAQ sets the price, to the extent of a few hundred shares perhaps.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb it's the least expensive to buy closest to where the security is issued (i.e. buy TSLA stock on NASDAQ), because every secondary market will require their small mark-up, and sometimes the small mark-up can be rather significant - but it never hurts to double check your FX setup and the honesty of your broker.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I've bought mine on the German exchange-the prices track the US (there'd be an arbitrage opportunity if they didn't), if you're a long term investor it should make no difference, if you're wanting to flit in and out of the market you're better off on NASDAQ which has higher volumes and hence better liquidity", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Fees are very low for NASDAQ and my broker (DeGiro) seems to do quite reasonable currency conversions.
