{"title": "The Case for Oil Tankers", "selftext": " Everyone has been going nuts over oil prices lately and oil is becoming bullish. What people have been overlooking is the tanker companies that ship the oil. $FRO has one of the largest and newest tanker fleet. Started by John Fredrickson during the Iran-Iraq war the guy became a billionaire shipping oil through dangerous war zones and waterways getting some serious tendies. Since then the tanker market has been weak,.. waiting for some war or higher shipping rates.  Even before the Saudi bombing WS had started to get bullish again on tankers and I believe the time has come. Today I went all in on long term $10 $FRO calls expiring in Jan 2020. There is gonna be a huge premium on tanker rates whether or not there is a war and they have already been increasing. Also if Iran’s oil production is decimated & the ME becomes glass Frontline tankers will get extra tendies from shipping oil greater distances (like from the good old USofA) instead of Sandland to China it’ll be US and Russia to China. Just look at the below chart. It appears we are hitting a reversal and heading into a new bull market for oil shipping (And this was made nefore the Saudi bombing)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wzrll1gl18n31.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8968a768f2b591c2fab34bae5ba88bb6057139c", "id": "d5nh5q", "created_utc": 1568755443.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "$DRYs is being bought out by CEO and privatized.
