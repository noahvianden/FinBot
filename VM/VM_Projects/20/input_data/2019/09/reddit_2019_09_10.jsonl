And as you say, some of these overlap so you're getting some reduced return from your investment.\n\nYou're just starting, you have time. I would say focus on one or two ETFs and a couple of stocks. You're not going to be a millionaire by having 1 share of Home Depot and one of Tesla. So why pay for that even if you think you've got good chances on the long run. At this point, reducing costs should be your main concern. What are you trying to get out of that UFO ETF? It's an expensive ETF and it's got 20 companies (or so). And that Healthcare ETF?

You improve on that later on.\n* one stock or two. Stick for now with companies that make money (i.e. ignore Tesla). Airbus may provide some diversification since it's European (and the price is in your currency so you have less risk) and may not be included in VXUS (I didn't check).

I totally understand and agree with Airbus.\n\nMaybe one last piece of advice, stage your purchases over a period, e.g. buy VUSA today, VWRD next week, and something else the week after that.
