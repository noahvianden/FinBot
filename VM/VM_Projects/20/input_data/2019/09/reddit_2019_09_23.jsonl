There are numerous companies that could and most likely will loose massive market caps, and some will gain immensely.\n\nCurrently in my opinion, the one stock which no one should buy under any circumstance is Nvidia, unless their next generation architecture is a monumental leap in specifically gaming performance. The reason behind this is they are being forced out of the data centre and AI space by ASICS. They are locked into raytracing, so they cannot use most of the die area for shader units or floating point integer cores for raw rasterization performance, and their current form of raytracing is not going to be adopted because they are not in consoles. Overall, unless they can pull off a miracle, they will be pushed out of the data centre and gaming space by ASICS and their primary two competitors.\n\nIntel is also in trouble, they currently have massive security flaws which has lead to a decrease in performance of ~60% when all security mitigation’s have been taken into account (not including disabling virtualization to counter NETCAT), so servers must buy more chips to increase server capacity, hence their supply issues. Furthermore, their desktop market share is in free fall, and unless they find a way to fix these flaws in the next revision, with a performance uplift and a reasonable TDP, they will be pushed out of the market by Zen 3, as it is entirely server focused and will introduce 2.5D stacking.\n\nTSMC is well positioned as it provides chips for both AMD and Nvidia, two of the most major players for semiconductors.\n\nAMD is currently in my opinion the most well positioned, currently they have had enormous success with desktops, in both CPUs and mid ranges GPUs. Currently their GPUs are about equal to the midrange that Nvidia is offering - at 100$ less, and roughly half the die area. This means they have great margins in their GPUs of at least 90%. Their latest CPUs are phenomenal, blowing away intel in almost every segment except for laptops. However, the most important segment is servers. Zen 3 is designed for servers, and with Infinity Fabric, we could see various accelerators added the CPU to aid performance in certain workflows, and with 7nm+, we could also see a 20% decrease in power consumption, or a 15% uplift in performance at the same TDP.\n\nThese are just my quick thoughts, what do you guys think.

Currently there are 2 major competitors either entering the market within the next two years or have already entered the market. \n\nFirst let’s look a little at the current Turing architecture on the market. Turing is Nvidia’s current architecture, and by all means it is a good architecture. However there are two notable flaws with it. Raytracing and tensor cores. Raytracing and the fix function hardware associated with it (here by referred to as RT cores) was a very poor implementation of raytracing as it attempted to combined it with rasterization meaning that it is path-tracing and not raytracing. The issue with this is that there are currently not enough RT cores to perform the calculations for pathtracing, meaning that the shader unites are bottlenecked by the RT cores so we observe a massive decrease in performance. With the next launch of Nvidia cards (not the refreshes), I would guess there would be at least a doubling in RT cores, however the primary issue with this is that their implementation of raytracing will be obsolete because of consoles. The next generation of consoles which are powered by an AMD apu will have raytracing, however the hardware will not be fix function, furthermore, it will be an open standard similar to DX12 meaning that vastly more games will be able to easily implement raytracing. This is a major issue with Nvidia because their hardware will not be as well optimized for these games, meaning lower performance. Furthermore, because they touted raytracing as their new schtick they cannot remove it the following generation as that would be admiring defeat, causing backlash in stock prices. Tensor cores for the most part are never used unless upsampling or for very specific rendering tasks, so on consumer GPUs, they are never used. These two factors have lead to Nvidia having enormous die areas, for example, the 2070 super has a die area in excess of 520mm^2. When we compare this to what the die are of AMD’s Navi GPUs, we see that they are a little less that half the size at roughly 250mm^2, this means that even taking into account the node shrink, the Navi GPUs are roughly 30% smaller. Smaller die sizes are much cheaper as yield are better, meaning that they can have a larger profit margin at a lower price. Furthermore, Nvidia dig themselves into an even deeper hole with the ludicrous 1200$ MSRP of the 2080ti. This astronomical price lets AMD scale their GPUs up to 650mm^2, handily beating Nvidia, and even put on HBM2E memory to add more efficiency and more bandwidth becomes a possibility. Nvidia’s compute cards are not looking good either because they are so expensive that companies are starting to simply make their own ASICs (ei: Tesla) or turning to AMD with their Vega solutions. Vega is a very good computer card, and with not getting into too much detail about how the architecture works, we could see a Vega card with 128 compute unites, twice as much are Vega frontier cards.\n\nAMD is not Nvidia’s biggest threat though. Intel is. Currently intel is getting dominated in the CPU space, and will not make a proper recovery until earliest 2021 (with current timelines and leaks). However, they recently spent 18b on consumer GPUs. To give some context, Turing costed roughly a billion over the course of 5 years. Intel just spent 18x that amount and they have some very smart people, meaning that their GPUs will be monsters in terms of efficiency. Not too many details are known about the Intel SKUs, however when we look at some of their earlier APUs, we see that even when Intel was not focusing on GPUs, they made incredible chips as seen in Ivy-bridge. \n\n\nMoving onto AMD’s warchest, they have a lot of incredible products around the corner coming out very soon. Zen 3 will in all likelihood have massive amounts of L4 cache, because of the fact it will be 2.5d stacked, meaning that we could see upwards of 1 GB of stacked HBM memory. This would help with deep learning applications and give an easy IPC gain. Furthermore, on Zen 3 or 4, we will see 4 way SMT which would be incredible for the data centre and would help with horizontal applications, which is the fastest growing segment in the server space. Compound this with Frontier edition CPUs which have fully integrated GPUs, we could see data centres no longer needing separate GPU servers. In fact, AMD could charge 100k/socket and it would be better than Cooperlake (the 56 core upcoming Intel CPU with a 400 watt TDP). On top of all of this, once a server switches companies, unless there are massive security vulnerabilities or the competition is twice or even four times as efficient as the current offerings, a company will not switch due to the lengthy validation process. And what do we see? Intel has insane vulnerabilities which have lead to a decrease of roughly 60% in performance (with disabling SMT to cover Spector and Meltdown), and their competition is over twice as efficient at half the price.\n\nFeel free to ask questions I skimmed over a lot of nuances and I may have forgotten something or another.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sorry, we don't know enough about Intel GPU efforts. Making a modern high end GPU is a massive undertaking and until we actually see first gen hardware in action, I'm not going to speculate on how it affects the competition. Their iGPUs are done by a different team and while usually feature-complete, the performance and general stability (in gaming) has been weak. Software is so massive in this effort and as AMD has shown in the past (they've now improved recently) you can have the best hardware but if your driver team is short-handed, you will be beaten. NVIDIA is clear leader in driver development and has been for a long time.\n\nI agree with the chip size issue. One upside is that NVIDIA will obviously go 7nm for the next one. If they feel super brave, they might even skip to 5nm if TSMC really has it in mass production in Q1 2020 since I doubt they will ship a new generation until autumn of 2020. Or they might do a 12 -> 7 die shrink of Turing spring 2020 and wait until 2021 for major architecture changes. No info, only speculating.\n\nAlso I would not be shocked if NV also manages to improve how to do the RT - existing implementation may have been just a stopgap to be first to market. Long term raytracing is obviously the thing, even if it will take in the ballpark of 3-4 more generations before we have enough muscle to actually consider doing real time full scene raytracing like they do offline for movies today.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I agree that NVIDIA will go for 7nm, or even 7nm+, however I find it doubtful that they would go for 5nm, because 7nm is already roughly twice the cost of 12nm so unless they want to bump prices or cut margins to the dismay of investors, 5nm is unlikely as it will not have good enough yields to make large enough dues to be relevant. \n\nWith regards to raytracing, it is important to differentiate between actual raytracing and pathtracing. Raytracing would be comparable to rasterization as it is a completely different way of rendering, and pathtracing is basically making fancy shadows. And here in lies the issue, at the moment, AMD is poised to dominate the raytracing market because of consoles and their open standards. When we compare this to Nvidia, we see that they are very closed on how they program pathtracing and how they get it implemented. Right now if you made a game and wanted raytracing, you essentially give it to Nvidia’s team and they take it from there, and this is an issue far devs because in the past they have implemented code that actively slowed AMD cards. With open standards, devs will program for AMD first and then Nvidia, meaning worse day one drivers, worse optimization and less support for their proprietary hardware.\n\nSo unless Nvidia pulls a 180, and make raytracing at least for times better and implements open standards that are easy to port from consoles, we will most likely see Nvidia get pushed aside.\n\nAlso Intel is dropping their consumer cards in 2020, so stay tuned for that and currently with what little leaks we have it is very efficient, and intel said themselves they are targeting the midrange with very efficient cards (were all the big bucks are made).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Raytracing is an open standard.

The difference will be clear enough that reviewers like Consumer Reports and Motor Trend will agree Tesla's system is the best.\n\nI also predict that by the end of Q1 2022 the popular narrative in the media, among stock analysts, and among consultants that Waymo is the furthest ahead on full autonomy and that Tesla is one of the furthest behind will be called into doubt, if not disproven.
