This week we heard the same from Caterpillar and Nvidia. The chart below breaks down Caterpillar‚Äôs machine sales by region.

In the recent quarter, North American construction growth was 17%. Construction sales were down 4% in Asia-Pacific. Tariffs cost Caterpillar $40 million in Q3. China only represents 5% to 10% of Caterpillar‚Äôs sales. China is more important to the global economy as over 30% of global growth will likely come from China in 2019.\n\nStarbucks had similar results to Caterpillar in that Asia-Pacific ex-China outperformed China. China/Asia-Pacific had¬†3% same store¬†sales growth with 1% transaction growth. China alone had a 2% decline in transactions and a 1% increase in sales. Even with China‚Äôs weakness, Starbucks increased its Chinese store count by 18%.\n\nNvidia faced issues in China as well. The firm lowered its Q4 revenue guidance from $2.7 billion to $2.2 billion.
