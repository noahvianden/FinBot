Do you want to be a trader or investor? Do you prefer etfs, mutual funds or single stocks? Ofc none of these are mutually exclusive. You can employ a combination of all of them.

If I were you Id look into value stocks with good dividends to buy just to get your feet wet. Once you get more comfortable with the market, you could look into trading more volatile stocks like AMD. It all depends on your risk appetite too. If you have a low risk tolerance, you could always just passively invest in a mutual fund or etf. Obviously its all your choice.
