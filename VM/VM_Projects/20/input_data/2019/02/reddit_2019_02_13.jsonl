I understand the Iron Condor benefits from Theta and that a 30-60 windows seems to be optimal time for adjustments and adequate decay. However, I have been paper trading a 3-day Iron Condror strategy that has been performing very well. The general idea being that the stock price would have to make a substantial movement in a short amount of time, if not, the entire premium would be kept as all positions would expire worthless. I've been using 5-day moving averages as a simple point of reference. Please advise as to why this is dumb before I take this into actual trading and lose all of my money.

That's it. That therefore makes the gamma a big part when you're approaching expiration, since the gamma is the rate of change of the delta.

In your case, you could defend with shares, but they are more capital intensive (they also don't trade 23/5).

If I only have say 25 beta weighted delta using $SPX (~$2700), I would hedge with a short position on /RUT (~$1500); with 50 deltas, I would use /es instead (~$2700).

The long term efficacy of your strategy will be largely determined by your ability to stick with the system after a few trades blow up in your face. Additionally, in my experience with condor strategies the constant outlay for the long strangle eats into your P&L that it makes it a lot harder to succeed than with a strangle system. That's not necesarilly a vote in favor of selling strangles, undefined risk isn't for everyone, but generally harder to make money being short premium when you cover with long premium as you are buying the same vol you are selling. To your question, theta wise an out of the money option close to expiry is going to move towards zero relatively quickly but with that said, you're selling a much tighter condor than you would farther out. So, although your P&L might come your way more quickly, it'll also go against you more quickly. You'll need to be able to stomach that vol in your P&L. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, general best practice IMO is to cover short options once they start approaching zero, the risk reward of being short a 5, 10, 15 cent option and hoping you can take it to zero really isn't there in my mind. Also keep in mind the odds you are giving. In this case I see the underlying around 355, so you're giving 2 to 1 that the stock doesn't move down more than 4% or up more than 2%. Final word on options selling, people like the strategies because they're clean and backtestable and the logic is there. The other side of that is no matter how smart you are on vol, theta, etc, gamma and delta can throw all that out the window in a heartbeat.

When you have 30-45 DTE, you have many more tools available to you for minimizing losses, e.g. waiting it out, rolling forward some of the tested legs for a credit, rolling some of the untested legs closer ITM for a credit, etc. \n\nIf on the other hand you sell something 3 DTE, you either win or lose. There’s little you can do but eat the losses when your trade goes bad. At least with longer dated options, I have the ability to turn a $300 loss into a $23 loss or even a $15 gain.

It seems super easy money. Was going to sell just inside 1 SD on both ends and buy with a $5 spread. High POP, but NVDA can be a big mover and I thought twice. Last earnings it dropped 20%.
