Compound interest is a beautiful thing. If you plan on long term investing, then you'll have time to let your stocks recover if a recession does occur. \n\nThat being said, I would ask yourself how much risk can you afford as a college student. If a recession hits, and you find yourself in a pickle, do you have enough funds in a low risk investment to reasonably cover any emergency costs? If not then I'd start building an emergency fund before buying stocks. I would either consider shopping around for a decent money market account or begin developing a CD ladder. \n", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "You might want to consider paying off your student loans first", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Important to remember you can always buy and sell stocks.
