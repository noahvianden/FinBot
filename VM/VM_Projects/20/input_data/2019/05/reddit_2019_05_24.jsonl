I‚Äôm sitting in an airport on a phone trying to look up financials. Lol \n\nIt‚Äôs probably fair to say that TSLAs fair market cap should be about 1/8th of Ford or GM just looking at revenue and nothing else. So, fords is appx 160B. In a sane world TSLA would be 20B but today it‚Äôs at 34B. Hence FMV by that analysis is 190 x (20/34) = about $110. \n\nAnd that assumes they break even, which they don‚Äôt. They have a serious debt issue and other big risks that are frankly hard to monetize (for me anyway). So take some off that price but add some back for whatever their hype is worth, again hard to monetize. So, still around $100 give or take. \n\nI think my analysis method is conservative.
