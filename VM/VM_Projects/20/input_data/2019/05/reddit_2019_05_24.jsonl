Here comes some redneck math. \n\nTSLA has no profits so you can’t do a standard EBITA analysis on it. Let’s do a market cap analysis instead. Pretend they break-even profitably now, which they don’t and haven’t, so revenue is about 20B. Compare it to auto peers Ford or GM who have revenues at 8x TSLA and actually do make a profit and have much less intrinsic risks. \n\nI’m rounding to make it easy, but if I goof the math, let me know. I’m sitting in an airport on a phone trying to look up financials. Lol \n\nIt’s probably fair to say that TSLAs fair market cap should be about 1/8th of Ford or GM just looking at revenue and nothing else. So, fords is appx 160B. In a sane world TSLA would be 20B but today it’s at 34B. Hence FMV by that analysis is 190 x (20/34) = about $110. \n\nAnd that assumes they break even, which they don’t. They have a serious debt issue and other big risks that are frankly hard to monetize (for me anyway). So take some off that price but add some back for whatever their hype is worth, again hard to monetize. So, still around $100 give or take. \n\nI think my analysis method is conservative.
