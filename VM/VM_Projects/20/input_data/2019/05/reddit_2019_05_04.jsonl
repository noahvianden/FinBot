So each EV is worth more to them specifically than anyone else, which is likely why they were so quick to ink this deal with Tesla.\n\nFCA sells about 900k cars per year, at an average emissions of 119g/km. They would need to pool 225K EVs anually to bring net emissions to below the 95g/km level to avoid any EU fees. This seems pretty well matched to Tesla's maturing volume in Europe (now that SR+ orders will start to ramp). FCA would see a staggering \\~€2.2B annually without any pooling credits. Now FCA also said that they would hope to not require any credit pooling starting in 2022 (unlikely). That means the €1.8B is effectively targeted at a 2-year term for 2020 and 2021 only, so €0.9B per annum. Compared to fines otherwise of €2.2B per annum, FCA is likely paying Tesla 40 cents on the dollar; not too far off my initial estimate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT -- worth nothing that 40 cents on the dollar estimate is only if tesla happens to makes precisely the same number of vehicles (225k) per year to exactly offset all of FCA's emissions. This is likely not the case and the agreement may be based around a more moderate run-rate of say 150k vehicles per annum. This would put the credit value closer to 60 cents on the dollar, in Tesla's favor. Truth is, we just don't know enough details of the agreement to know for sure exactly how good a rate Tesla is getting.", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "I see this is your original content.

So if the volume is say 150k per annum instead of 225k, then it would be closer to 60 cents on the dollar. We just don't know enough to say for sure.\n\nSome companies I'm sure are hoping that their own EV supply will come soon enough that they can weather 1-2 years of fines. They may opt to take that temporary hit to avoid emboldening Tesla any further. Tough strategy decision.\n\nAgain the big issue here is battery supply; other manufacturers have major disadvantages ahead.

{"title": "Buybacks haven't caused a stock market bubble.", "selftext": "The most fallacious argument buyback bubble critics make is when they state where stocks would be without buybacks while ignoring where that capital could have gone. According to Ed Clissold of Ned Davis Research, the S&P 500 would be 19% lower if buybacks vanished and the money disappeared. The money would go somewhere, if it didn’t go to buybacks. The S&P 500 would only be 5% lower if the money used for buybacks was held as cash. So much for buybacks creating a massive bubble in stocks.\n\nThe S&P 500’s total return would be 10% lower if buybacks were replaced with dividends. If buybacks were replaced with reinvestments, the S&P 500 would be 2% lower. It’s very easy to claim firms should just invest their excess capital in their businesses. However, when you’re actually running the business you need figure out if the rate of return and the risk makes sense for investors. If it doesn’t, firms return the money to shareholders. Since 2011, investors have liked when firms buy back stock or keep the cash. Stocks where firms invested the money in capex did the worst, something we discussed in the past.
