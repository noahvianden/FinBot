Secondly, Apples tax rate is nowhere near 40%. When calculating WACC, I would use apples actual debt rate, (I'm assuming they have public debt). You can pull their beta, and use the CAPM model. Just look that up. An important factor that the CAPM model ignores though is size premium. This will be important for smaller companies, and k would assume for Apple that you would give them a discount as they are one of the largest companies in the US. \n\nThis is a good thing to have an understanding of in order to learn what drives value, but at the end of the day, there are too many assumptions to make without having an insanely strong understanding of the process to invest by building DCFs.
