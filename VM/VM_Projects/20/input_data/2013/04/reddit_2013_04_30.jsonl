The reason I sold was because the stock went up exponentially in just a month and the recent slope is pretty steep (in my experience this will adjust downward a bit at some point bc the rise is \"unhealthy\"), plus I hit a nice profit percentage.

I'm not sure that I want to set a \"Time.\"  I think \"Time\" means, how long should the broker be looking to see if the stock ever meets the 5% drop condition.  I might want this indefinite (if I change my mind, can trailing stop orders be cancelled?)  \n\nLastly, what does the \"Duration\" mean?  Does that mean I set how fast the stock would need to drop to fill that order?  So, if I set the duration to one day, the stock would have to drop 5% in a day for the order to be filled; whereas, if I set the duration to one week, the order will be executed even if it takes a whole week for the stock to drop 5%.  \n\nAm I getting all that right, or do I have something wrong in there?\n\nYour help is appreciated.\n", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "http://research.scottrade.com/public/knowledgecenter/knowhownews/intheknow.asp?nlid=591c9dc7a80f48fd94de8de658dc29d3", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "You only know you're high is you've done some reasonable analysis to determine that $35 might be more than it's worth.\n\nMaybe $28 was really low, and $35 is still low.\n", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Listen Guys, Don't Sell it.
