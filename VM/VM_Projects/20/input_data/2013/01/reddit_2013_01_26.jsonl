I've been meaning to get into stocks for a bloody long time but have put it off due to a seemingly overwhelming about to information to take in. So I chicken out, but this time I am kicking myself as I had intended to invest in Netflix for a while now and I've just missed out on a bit of a boom.\n\nSorry, story over. Can you provide me the essentials to get started? The best site, broker, best community, etc? I know a lot of you will say £100 isn't enough to earn money, this is just to to work things out - as long as I don't lose too much of it and learn the way of the Stock then hopefully I can start taking it more seriously with higher amounts.\n\nThanks for your time!", "id": "17ah5s", "created_utc": 1359162310.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "Every broker has transaction fees. This fee will be assessed every time you buy and every time you sell. Let's say you start with $100 and use scottrade. Each transaction costs you $7. If you put all of your money into 1 stock, you can buy $93 worth of stock. So you're already at a 7% loss before anything happened. Say the stock evens out and you decide to sell. You end up with $86 even though your stock did not gain or lose money. You need your stock to gain 14% to just break even. Of course you actually want to diversify and not have all of your money in one stock. If you decide to split your money between 2 stocks, then you need a net return of at least 28% just to break even. Do you see where I'm going with this? $100 is not enough to actually play the market. You're better off doing simulations or pretend purchases in order to get practice until you have a better bankroll to get actually started.

Hmm.\n\nOk, forget about my temporary limit - was just a theoretical limit I pulled out my ass. What would you say was essential to get started? Basically the other bit of my question. Best site, community, etc?

I try to keep my trading fees at about 1% of my purchase; since Scottrade's fee is 7$, I will only pick up 700$ or more worth of a stock. In your case, I'd say you need at least 500£ to put in one stock. Generally, you don't want more than 10% of your wealth in one stock, but since you're just getting started, it might be a slight exception. Personally, I'd recommend just putting away whatever you can with every paycheck and letting it accumulate. At the moment, most of the market's pretty overvalued and ready for a correction, in my opinion, so you're not missing out on any screaming buys for long-term holdings.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I have more money that 100, I just would have played with that as I was learning.
