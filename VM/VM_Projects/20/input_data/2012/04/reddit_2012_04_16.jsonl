It's pure gambling though. \n\nWhat I'm really interested in lately are ATM options on expiration, so basically on friday. There are 2 major things you can play with, volatility collapse or options that are barely OTM. \n\nBasically, at 2:30pm on friday, if AAPL is at 598, the 600 calls will be almost worthless.

With the same example, if AAPL is trading at 598, the 600 call options will be worth like $0.10. If AAPL jumps to 602, those options will go up to $2.05.

I'm pretty sure I underestimated the price though. Although, at one point, around 20 minutes before the closing bell, the price dropped to $0.01 and 8 minutes later, the price was $0.50. It's insane that it did 5000% in that short time. I don't understand who would sell at $0.01 though, which goes with your statement that the bid/ask spread should be quite high.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I've never even heard of this strategy.  why would you do that just to make such a small margin?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
