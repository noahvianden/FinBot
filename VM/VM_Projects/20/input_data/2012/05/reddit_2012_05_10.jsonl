{"title": "After the bell: Nordstrom (JWN) Earnings", "selftext": "Nordstrom is a high end clothing retailer (fuck you if you don't already know) and what I really like about them is that they only operate stores in the US (no international exposure = no shitty outlook due to european economic worries) and their April and 1st Q SSS (same store sales) both increased. High end retailers seem to be doing fine during the slow US recovery. It would appear there is still a demand for luxury goods and US consumers are willing to pay more for something that they perceive is high quality. Middle-level department stores have been getting CRUSHED because they can't truly offer value to consumers the way a low-end retailer can (savings) or a high end retailer can (quality). Revenue would appear to be flowing out of mid-level retailers and into either high-end or lower-end stores. JWN pulled back from a high of about $57.50 to $53 during this last week's correction. Looking for JWN to beat earnings expectations and give positive guidance for FY '13.\n\nDisclosure: I am long JWN $55 May calls.", "id": "tgnaa", "created_utc": 1336666446.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "general note: if there were a few threads each day like this on r/wallstreetbets about different stocks people were watching and why, this will become an active, interesting, & informative subreddit in no time.
