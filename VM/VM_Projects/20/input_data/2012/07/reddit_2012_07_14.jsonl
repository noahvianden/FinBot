Bonus: thanks!", "selftext": "From reading r/stocks, I'm just going to put trust in you guys that penny stocks are just the worst idea ever. But how cheap must a stock be to be a \"penny stock\"? I'm toying with the idea of buying some shares of The Digital Development Group (DIDG), which now sits at $.55/share. I wholeheartedly believe that cable subscriptions and viewers will decrease substantially, and alternative TV viewing will explode over the next 5 years, and I'd like to get in on that market.\n\n\nAlso, I took the plunge and just invested in the stock market for the first time earlier this week! Thanks to everyone here for the information and friendly base of people saying go for it. I went with Scottrade for my broker and have 90 shares of Micron (MU) and 6 shares of Netflix (NFLX). I'm not very risk adverse and I'm going long (possibly a few years) so although I have relatively low capital in each stock, I think over the long term the $7/trade won't effect me too much. I'm up $4 already, including the buy trade fee. Of course I'm still negative with the sell trade fee, but...meh.  I'm looking to invest approximately another $1500, and I'm currently looking for stocks to invest in.  Not really sure how to find them at the moment, but am still actively looking!

Some people I've heard will both go long and short on a stock to maintain their net worth.\n\nMy technique is to basically not buy unless the market has been going down down down for a period.
