Over the next 10 years, you should easily see the dividend triple or quadruple. The share price may fluctuate but if you plan on only being in there for 6 months more, sell it.  If you plan on 10 years, keep it. I suggest writing down your emotions before you make any decisions.  That way you brain isn't overloaded and can help prevent a bad decision. One of the key things I have ever learned. That is why most of Wall Street is so successful.  They don't have much empathy that gets in the way of performance. It is sad but true.

Some of this is going to sound like \"well this doesn't help me right now that I already own them\" but hear me out as it'll help in the future and it'll help when trying to figure out where this one went wrong.\n\nBefore all of this though. TL;DR if you don't have a plan other than \"buy this stock, it'll make money\" then sell right now. The key to making money here, above all else, is to have a plan. If you don't get out until you've got one.\n\nThat said, before you bought the stock you should have already asked yourself the questions: \"How high do I think this stock will go and why?\" \"At what point do I start taking profit\" (this should happen before it hits the price you actually think it'll hit), \"What do I do if it doesn't react the way I think it should?\" (99% of the time here the answer is 'get out').\n\nIf you don't even have an answer to those questions, at a minimum, then you shouldn't be in this position. Get out. This is the same advice I'd give you if you were asking about apple 3 months ago, or any other stock regardless of time scale.\n\nYou shouldn't be asking this question, you should have answered this question before you put your money on the line. You should have had a plan. Whenever a trade goes against your plan, you get out.\n\nIt really sounds like you don't have a plan, not having a plan is worse than a trade not behaving as you planned.

Check APPL every quarter when you get your statement. \n\n    B) pay for next semesters tuition?  Watch APPL like a baby holding a gun.
