There’s also GTA online, NBA 2k online, and Red Dead online, all of which are fairly popular. TakeTwo has other games as well, but these are the most popular. Clearly, GTA V is their bread and butter, but NBA and RDR2 are doing fairly well. GTA V is also #7 on twitch’s most popular games.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome google trends:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GTA V - current search popularity higher than holiday season](https://preview.redd.it/6dpnnt44bfy41.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=72a39ebc737219e6170aba5fd92f1dfaffe7a2a9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Civ 6](https://preview.redd.it/ejogx53bbfy41.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&s=30bea8679ac8c6075ce0762963033b96221a3776)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[NBA 2k20 - Only surpassed by release date](https://preview.redd.it/74xk57xdbfy41.png?width=1403&format=png&auto=webp&s=c209fe188f0a018f7c68186529937852442646a2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Other competitors:**\n\nTaketwo has beaten earnings estimates for the last 3 quarters in a row. Their projected Q1 EPS is 0.56. EA and Activision both also beat earnings this quarter and we’re all aware of why: everyone is at home and bored out of their mind. Gaming is one of the few things that there is to do. Microsoft’s CEO stated recently that Xbox live use was almost at an all-time high. Furthermore, Ttwo isn’t as reliant as EA or Activision for yearly releases. I touched on this before, but GTA online, Red Dead online, and NBA 2k online generate tons of revenue for Taketwo in the form of microtransactions. NBA 2k online will be livestreamed on ESPN2, for example and it has 50 million users in China alone. GTA online has shown increasing revenue growth. 2019 Q4 has an increase of 54% in revenue from recurrent purchasers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Financials:**\n\nNo long-term debt. Assets, revenues, and net income have been going up. They’ve continued to repurchase their stock.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**However...** they're already at their ATH and they haven't had any big blockbuster release this quarter. Activation had COD drop meanwhile EA had nothing major. The big difference may just be revenue from microtransaction but I'm too stupid to figure out how to calculate that. IV is also fairly high right now for their options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow are you all gambling on this?", "id": "gint41", "created_utc": 1589328715.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "> I'm Thinking of buying it again after all this commotion is over, paying much attention to their PS5/XBox game releases and specially their new GTA \n\nI was thinking the same, especially if we do have another drop in market.

TTWO is a perfect example of great stock that gets zero media attention (relatively speaking). a lot of users here and new investors are betting on companies like tesla to change the world, and grow to a market cap of 1 trillion. At the time of this post, TTWO’s market cap is 15 billion. EA is valued almost 3 times that, and so is activision. with the way investors value companies now a days, i would not be surprised if wall street values TTWO at a high P/E (maybe around 60-70) considering the stock is destined to reach a market cap like EA or activision. TTWO can easily double in the next 12 months. \n\nits also a perfect stock to own (or play with options). picture the following two scenarios:\n\n\nscenario 1: the second wave of covid comes, and all states scratch their reopening proposals, and go back to square one, and extended quarantine for another 3-6 months minimum. NASDAQ and SP500 stocks dip 10-15 percent (i dont think a crash is happening, sorry but you really cant fight the fed). the next headline you would see from CNBC would be something like “investors turn to video game, and quarantine stocks amid 2nd wave of covid lockdown”\n\ncongrats: you’re rich. your TTWO just went up 10-20 percent (being conservative)\n\nscenario 2: covid vaccine is found and skips FDA approval! NASDAQ,SP500 rally!\n\ncongrats: you made some decent money (along with everyone else) you did not hit the jackpot, but thats okay (unless you YOLO everything then this scenario sucks)\n\n\n\n\n\nTTWO will no doubt 3 fold its current market cap. video games is the fasting growing category in the entertainment industry. i don’t see any scenario where this stocks falls even 5 percent in the next year. video game stocks do great in recessions. they are not selling any expensive products. GTA is already in the hands of many people, this can only lead to higher micro transactions. the NBA is not broadcasting games. fans need to get their sporting entertainment through another medium which will be nba 2k, and again, most people already have this game this is really just going to boost micro transactions. \n\nmy prediction: stock will be at $150 next week, and finish the year around $170.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Well said.

{"title": "The viral DD - discussion", "selftext": "We have seen a lot of \"pump and dump\" style viral news.\n\nWhether it's hydroxchloroquine or the remdesi-desi-vir(as trump calls it), treatments have show promise only to find they have serious side effects negating any positive effects. Honestly from a science perspective a lot of it has been bullshit \"pump\" for the laymen that doesn't know better. I just have a bachelors in bio, but it's easy enough to see through.\n\nThere is however one promising treatment / mitigation that is out right now, and FDA approved and if you are under 50, you've likely already had it.\n\nThe MMR vaccine.\n\nMost of the evidence is correlation right now but there is some solid science behind it.\n\nThe science:\n\n1. Basically the rubella virus has about 29% similarity to covid-19. Basically you look at the genetic sequence and compare them which is easy enough to do.\n2. Rates of hospitalization and death are strikingly higher in 55 years or older people\n3. MMR vaccine has very low side effects, autism study was faked by a lawyer in Britain with a financial interest that has since been disbarred.\n\nThe theory:\n\nEssentially it boils down to that the antibodies your body develops against rubella help you fight the coronavirus, so while you will get infected, you end up with a milder form of the disease.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. If you are under 55, you've likely had the MMR two dose vaccination\n2. US military gets two dose MMR vaccines regardless if they've already had it or not (and that battleship that was in news that got infected showed a super low hospitalization to infection rate). Granted military is a sample of younger and healthier people, but still.\n3. Kids have very less severe reactions to coronavirus and the antibody titer for rubella can decline with time, see a random study I googled in the last 5 minutes. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255950/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3255950/)\n4. Studies of rubella immunity shows higher immunity to rubella after recovery from severe cases of coronavirus: [https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/25417/20200422/29-percent-similarity-between-coronavirus-rubella-virus-help-mmr-vaccine.htm?fbclid=IwAR2PVSDqZbO0hRY0fHONGAuvUwUTjqpIGPAOWKxZiACdkfpbbDW1t3QAk08](https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/25417/20200422/29-percent-similarity-between-coronavirus-rubella-virus-help-mmr-vaccine.htm?fbclid=IwAR2PVSDqZbO0hRY0fHONGAuvUwUTjqpIGPAOWKxZiACdkfpbbDW1t3QAk08)\n\n\"In an attempt to justify their theory, the team studied blood  samples from coronavirus patients in England and studied signs of  rubella immunity in moderately and severely ill patients. Their approach  proved to be accurate when they saw higher levels of immunity among  patients with severe cases of the disease after they had recovered.\"\n\n5. Studies are currently ongoing to match whether the rubella titer (aka how much antibodies you have in your blood against rubella) compare against coronavirus disease severity\n\nSee [https://world.org/MMR-Titers](https://world.org/MMR-Titers)\n\nStudy here:\n\n[https://world.org/covid-19](https://world.org/covid-19)\n\nResults from the study are out in a few weeks.\n\nBasically if this proves out, then it might be possible to get booster shots of a known safe vaccine and let the virus rip through the population without mitigation measures.\n\nSo with that information in mind,\n\nWhat stocks do you see benefiting most from this? The tricky bit is that few weeks timeline will likely hit the same timeframe as when US states that opened too early will need to shut down.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "gitgmh", "created_utc": 1589351122.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is a casino", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "this lecture is so good that i actually enjoy hearing it between slot machine runs and buying MRK calls.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You autists will literally find the cure to a world wide disease if it means saving your calls.  \n\nI love this place", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "You autists will literally created a world wide disease if it means securing your puts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGod Damn, I love this place.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is actually legit.
