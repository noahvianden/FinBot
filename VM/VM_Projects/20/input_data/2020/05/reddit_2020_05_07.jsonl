{"title": "My case for SPCE (with TL;DR)", "selftext": "There was another thread here today by u/SorrowsSkills asking simply, \"What are your favourite disruptive/futuristic stocks?\" \n\nAnd my answer was... No question: SPCE\n\nWith the following reasoning:\n\n>They should be profitable by as soon as Q3 2021  \n>  \n>As far as space tourism, they already have 3,000 ticket holders at a price of $350,000 each. That number is only going to go up exponentially. In 30 years, a ticket to space could be well under $50,000, making it accessible as a bucket list item for hundreds of thousands of people every year.  \n>  \n>That's just the tip of the rocket ship.  \n>  \n>Virgin Galactic also has the only spacecraft that is shaped like a badass airplane. They are going to be launching trans-oceanic flights at supersonic speeds within 10 years. Just like bullet trains did for land travel, but picture BULLET PLANES. Being able to travel from the U.S. to Japan in under 2 hours will be a game-changer for executive travel.  \n>  \n>That's the appetizer and the main course. Dessert is all of the university, research, military, and government contracts that will bring in steady income during all years of development. Can you imagine the next World War involving destroying foreign satellites and firing missiles from space? Well, you'll need trained astronaut soldiers for that.  \n>  \n>Anyway, I've got a lot of my eggs in this basket and have faith in the two famous co-founders to execute their vision.  \n>  \n>🚀\n\nBut then I decided to do a little more hard number crunching and see what the future could look like for SPCE as the volumes of space tourists increases. To do this, I used a very simple valuation metric of growth companies: P/S. \n\nThis perspective assumes that profit does not matter, however, Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya said in an interview, “I think the profitability of this company is going to look as good as one of the best software companies around. This is a business at scale that will have almost 70% operating margin.” Therefore, I consider this analysis as very conservative considering the modest profitability of the comparison companies.\n\nTo envision the future for SPCE stock, I picked three well-known comparisons against whom to benchmark P/S valuations: Tesla (tech/automotive), Carnival Cruise (luxury travel), and Delta Airlines (air transportation).\n\nLooking at the present day, here are the valuations of SPCE and the others:\n\n||SPCE|TSLA|CCL|DAL|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Shares|206.1MM|205.26MM|837.32MM|685.16MM|\n|Price|$18.50|$782.00|$12.82|$21.00|\n|Market Cap|$3.81B|$160.51B|$10.73B|$14.39B|\n|Sales|$3.8M|$26.02B|$20.94B|$45.13B|\n|P/S|1003|6.17|0.51|0.32|\n|P/S Pre-Corona|||\\~1.5|\\~0.9|\n\nObviously, with tiny sales, SPCE looks ridiculously expensive, but let's see what the future might look like when sales ramp up.\n\n**Case 1:**  \nStarting in 2022, considering the global population with UHNW ($10MM+) of around 600,000, if only 1% of them use their disposable income on space tourism at a ticket price of $350,000, that will result in sales of $2.1B. Using the various P/S ratios above -- depending on how the market will view this company, the resulting SPCE price would look like this:\n\n|P/S|6|3|1.5|0.9|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|SPCE price|$61.14|$30.57|$15.28|$9.17|\n\n**Case 2:**  \nIt's now 2050, ticket prices have fallen to only $50,000 (less than a Tesla vehicle) and now anyone with a minimum $1,000,000 net worth can reasonably afford to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip to space. Assuming 1% of a global population of millionaires approaching 40,000,000 people, sales would be $20B (on par with Carnival Cruises) and the resulting SPCE prices would look like this:\n\n|P/S|6|3|1.5|0.9|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|SPCE price|$582.24|$291.12|$145.56|$87.34|\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nObviously, no one knows the future or how the market will value any given company, but I personally believe that SPCE is not a novelty company or a \"meme stock\", but one of the best early disruptors available today.\n\nDepending on if you think my assumptions are conservative/aggressive and if you view space tourism as innovative/commodity, it may or may not be a wise investment. When factoring in supersonic, trans-oceanic executive business travel and research/government contracts that are likely to develop, getting to $20B in sales before 2050 is a pretty safe bet -- you can decide the date for yourself. And given the newness factor and disruptive nature of the company, it seems more reasonable to expect a Tesla-like valuation over a Delta-like valuation.\n\n**TL;DR**   \nPut your life savings into SPCE stock\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho else is coming with me to SPCE?? 🚀", "id": "gex0ha", "created_utc": 1588814364.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "Lol your DD convinced me not to invest in SPCE", "score": 36, "replies": []}, {"body": "I don't buy it. \n\nIts innovation doesn't compete with the likes of Space X and Blue Origin.

{"title": "ZM: why the market may be substantially underestimating the upside", "selftext": "When I saw everyone shitting on Zoom as an undifferentiated hype stock at WSB, figured there may be a contrarian play, so started doing some digging. Just my view - disclosure, obviously long shares and calls, a few FDs included. Earnings coming up in early June and think there's 2-3x price appreciation potential in the next 6-12 mos. \n\nTLDR: Zoom undervalued at anything less than $200 a share as market discounting new subscribers. Sorry for the bullet formatting, I tried. \n\nHigh level thesis: \n*\tMarket underestimating the impact of daily participants growth from 10MM/day at end of 2019 to 300MM/day as of early April\n*        \tWhile education and other venues have received free access, this does not explain the broader growth. There are 60-70MM people in US at school age. Assuming 25% using Zoom at 5x instances a day, that yields 80-100MM of the 290MM growth from education\n*      \tBoth new and existing enterprise Zoom users have likely rapidly increased adoption in the last 90 days, adding more paying users per company than previously assumed (e.g., a firm with 50 employees that may have shared 4-5 licenses or used a free version is now ramping usage)\n*\tHigh free cash flow, subscription revenue business provides visibility into earnings potential on an annualized, runrate basis\n*      \tSubscription based model that is a small cost per employee, especially compared to traveling for in person meetings (e.g., annual subscription a fraction of the cost of one business trip per year)\n*      \tMarket will price ZM on a quarterly runrate basis derived from paying users, which will be reported in early June along with MD&A on new users through that date\n*\tContinued COVID issues will drive subscription and paying user growth\n*      \tEarly state reopenings will drive companies to delay return to work and travel due to risks of virus continuing to circulate (e.g., many financial firms banning travel until 2021); consensus for a 2nd wave in the 2H of 2021\n*      \tDespite reopenings, dual income households unable to go to work due to childcare constraints as schools, daycares, and camps closed until the fall or beyond\n*      \tCOVID accelerating long term shift toward remote working; commercial air travel to remain challenged for next 6-12 months (Evercore surveys point to investors’ belief that business travel does not recover until 2H2021) further entrenching people being comfortable working from home or doing remote meetings\n*\tCompetitive moat built through brand, GUI, and early mover advantage\n*      \tZoom is a name brand in the business community; technology not just an app but becomes entrenched in conference room set-ups, internal company procedures and IT stack\n*      \tCost of service is de minimis for recent competitive activity from Google or Facebook to matter ($120/user/year not worth behavioral change/shift requirements)\n*      \tZM preferred due to GUI, user friendliness (prior to it being banned, Google’s own employees overwhelmingly preferred Zoom and company considered buying Zoom)\n*      \tOther larger tech companies have challenges in switching Zoom users (FB: personal privacy and bridge to enterprise applications; GOOG: niche user base and need to be in GOOG ecosystem; MSFT: clunky user interface embedded in complex Teams universe, slow to roll out upgrades)\n\nIn terms of the risks / bear case for the story, common questions and concerns are the following:\n\n*\tValuation too high: “1000 PE,” “ridiculous revenue multiple” to be addressed shortly. Net net there is visibility into near term runrate $2B in annualized EBITDA, which at a 50x multiple (appropriate given growth), implies substantial price upside\n*\t“Muh competition”: addressed above. Solutions provided by FB are geared toward social users (who are not paying and ZM doesn’t want anyway); MSFT is too clunky and ZM viewed as a complementary application; GOOG: not everyone wants a gmail account and even Google’s own employees prefer Zoom. Thankfully for the bull case, all these threats are now out in the open and “priced in”\n*\tAll the growth will go away post COVID: 1) COVID not going away anytime soon (see: second wave, mutations, too early openings, residual fears; 2) post conversion, video conferencing will still be used, particularly to save on corporate travel and will replace conference calls that were done prior to COVID. Additionally, companies will want this capability in place for risk mitigation/business continuity. Given this, the subscription users will stay in place and continue to convert from free users 3) the education (K-12/college) users who will go away weren’t paying and will plant seeds for future growth as they join the workforce 4) the growth in users was 30x in the course of 30-60 days\n*\t“Muh security concerns and Zoom bombing”: acquisition of KeyBase + Eric’s 90 day plan appears to be allaying concerns. Separately, the security concerns appear to be hyped up by competitors vs. actual threats – a number of reputable firms continue to onboard Zoom and NYC schools has reversed its decision. Just note that FB channeled Russian hackers on its platform that changed the outcome of US elections and appears to not effect its valuation. \n\nValuation: the gutcheck – stock has appreciated ~2x pre-COVID though daily participants have grown 30x. All else being equal, market is discounting a substantial portion of upside growth. However, it is important to note that FYQ2 (the next quarter being reported for period ending 4/30) will not nearly reflect the runrate performance given most of the recent surge happened late in the quarter. \n\n*\tContext of where we are and what we know about the numbers\n**\tIn the most recent quarter ending January, Zoom generated $188MM in revenue and $10MM of EBITDA. It is important to note that Zoom operates at 82-83% gross margin (that means each incremental dollar generates 80 cents of profit or EBITDA assuming no scale up of backoffice and overhead). Said differently, it is very cheap for Zoom to support incremental user growth as is with most software/subscription businesses\n**\tOn an annualized basis pre-COVID, Zoom was generating roughly $800MM in revenue and $40MM of EBITDA. The low EBITDA margins are due to the SG&A/overhead that has yet to be (but soon will be) leveraged\n**\tExiting the most recent quarter, Zoom had 10MM daily participants, which translates into ~$75 of annualized revenue per daily participant (includes both paying and non-paying participants). Note that this 10MM includes those who used the platform for free prior to COVID, so if the same mix of paying and non-paying participants continued, you’d see an unbelievably large ramp in revenue and earnings\n**\tZoom grew to 200MM daily participants in early April, then 300MM toward the end of April\n**\tObviously, you can’t just take the 300MM x $75 a year factor, which would translate into $24B in annualized revenue – it is likely a larger percentage of free users joined, including college and K-12 students. The question is what %? That’s what I will lay out below. \n\n*\t Valuing the growth potential – anything less than $200/share is drastically undervaluing Zoom\n**\tThe question is then of the 290MM new daily participants, how closely does that match to the profile of the preexisting 10MM daily participants. That is what we will then apply the $80/annualized revenue figure\n**\tBeing conservative, let’s just assume 20%. That implies 58MM out of the 290MM new daily participants that match the mix of paying/non-paying as pre-COVID users and that the rest of the 230MM will not pay at all\n**\tThat yields to an INCREMENTAL annualized revenue figure of $4.4B ($75/year x 58MM)\n**\tBack to our gross margin point, Zoom generates 82-83% gross margins\n**\tInstead of doing a straight calculation on that as flow through, let’s assume another 20-25% cost on the incremental revenue in additional SG&A as well as costs to serve the incremental free users\n**\t$4.4B x 60% = $2.2B in annualized operating profit (EBITDA)\n**\tSo how do we value ZM on that basis?

For one, the biggest mistake in your entire analysis is that Zoom has 300M daily participants ACROSS MEETINGS. This does not mean they have 300m users but 300m participants across all meetings (ie is the average person does 2 meetings per day, then you have 150m daily users). For comparison, Teams has reported 75m actual daily users. Idk why Zoom is so reluctant to state the actual DAU count but that alone is a red flag to me. 2nd, Zoom is used internationally, so limiting your counts in students, etc to US will lead to overinflated corporate user numbers. 3rd, MSFT, CIsco, etc serve corporations across a broader use spectrum. Microsoft offers their broader office solution and most companies will take Teams as an add-on to that. In addition, Teams offers corporations additional flexibility to share files, work off the same file, etc that Zoom does not do\n\nAll Im saying is that this is a space with limited differentiation and where a ton of high bankroll players are investing. Zoom has gained popularity due to a spike in non-paying users (which will negatively impact margins btw). I have been getting burned by Zoom for a while but Im overall confident that this business should not be valued at this price over the long term.

First of all, the average meeting per user has increased significantly since the start of quarantine. Even if Zoom didnt add a single new user, Im sure they’d be able to claim a 4x-5x increase in daily participants just from increased meeting volume (i work a corporate job and i think 4x to 5x is being conservative if anything). This would lead to 40-50m participants with no change in actual users and it would likely also have a negative impact on their margins due to increased bandwidth used up. \n\nNow, you can maybe apply your logic and say they were able to scale to about 6x users (ie going from 50m to 300m participants). And based on what Ive seen, the majority of these people are likely non paying users, so maybe 50% of that 6x user gain is from pying customers. Again that is very liberal imo. \n\nYou need to understand that the privacy hacks likely came at a terrible time for them since it was at the beginning of quarantine when corporations were likely looking at video conferencing solutions; at the start of quarantine/WFH. That was the time to capture them.

Separately, the original 10MM were likely already hyper adopters. \n\nMy firm (financial services) has 300 employees and we went from a handful of licenses and 3-4 Zoom rooms to now almost all of us being given \"host\" account status.

{"title": "$SDC Tendies May Put A Smile On Your Face!", "selftext": "TLDR and position at bottom\n\n**The Company:**\n\nSDC is a telehealth company primarily offering dental products like aligners (think invisalign).  There are two ways of using SDC: 1) go to a Smile Shop (several locations internationally) and see a doctor for an initial check-up and get pics of your mouth taken for a 3D model or 2) DIY traditional impression kit from home (that pink algae stuff).\n\nRecently, Smile Shops have been closed until May 3rd due to COVID and SDC has moved to an all DIY impression kit model. (I'd actually like to see this be the primary model for the company moving forward as it reduces costs and is more aligned with the DIY trends). \n\n**Financial Position:** \n\nCurrently have $350m cash on hand, only $200m in total debt outstanding. The company also has a credit facility for up to $500m from JPM.  For a growing business with international exposure, the risks that this thing is going to disappear seem unlikely and the company is healthy enough to weather this storm. \n\n**Traction:**\n\nMain revenues are from financing (they offer 17% APR thru a program for paying for their product over a length of time, with the manufacturing costs due up front as deposit, so they never lose money here even with delinquency and this is damn near loan sharking, but only a minor part of total revenues) and from their aligners (which cost about 50% as much as traditional invisalign); together, gross margins are a nice \\~70%. I believe SDC already had a good business model. \n\nLast year's net loss was about $500m. Mainly due to increasing marketing and SGA costs to achieve growth and IPO. However, these things come at the expense of gaining new customers - and most important KPI for a growth company is their increase in product shipments and revenue growth, which grew 80% last year (plus SDC already has good margins and balance sheet). Why do I think these metrics are going to look even better? \n\nNow, in a time where health is becoming increasingly important, people are staying at home, consumer discretionary spending is limited due to recession, I believe the DIY at home product offering, available financing programming, and cheap alternative to traditional orthopedics is very attractive. Also, EOY 2019 SDC picked up Aetna and United Health to help provide coverage, plus another recent deal which shot up the stock 10% yesterday (insurance for dental health is difficult and these partnerships will expand consumer reach further).\n\nAdditionally, Teladoc has mooned to ATH while SDC has been left behind, trading at $7.50 vs $15 pre-COVID. Yet, rigorous DD on Google Trends shows they've been about equally popular in the past 90 days ( probably not directly comparable because Teladoc likely converts more customers from searches) : [Link](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%203-m&geo=US&q=Teladoc,Smile%20Direct%20Club) \n\n**The Bad:**\n\nThere exists significant media covering problems with the SDC products, but I dont think this is specific to just SDC, as there exists articles for aligners like invisalign in general. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR:** Financial health looks like SDC will survive, has already good business model with nice margins and is growing revenue significantly, trading 50% off pre-covid high while Teladoc has mooned and I think covid issues will actually help the company's growth (DIY, cheap alternative, financing options).\n\n**Position:** $8c 5/22 (ER is 5/13)", "id": "gfb06x", "created_utc": 1588872532.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "You son of a bitch...

{"title": "$ELY $GOLF $DS Kill marry fuck", "selftext": "The golf industry is one of the weird ones during this pandemic. There was a crash in early March, and a subsequent recovery that has mirrored the overall market. The thing is, 50% of golf courses never closed. People never quit playing, and tee times have anecdotally been more difficult to get in golfing hot spots like AZ, NC, SC, GA, and FL. Granted, lots of those golfers will die of coronavirus due to their age and affinity for cigars, but I'm here to play a stupid game, not mourn boomers: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nKill: $DS\n\nThis company is actually cool, it kind of takes the experience Top Golf provides and twists it toward arcade-style (hit balls in a simulator instead of into RGB buckets on a driving range. They sell lots of beer, which is an extremely profitable activity. But, like every place that used to sell beer, they are fucking closed. Can't make money if your doors aren't open. They fired, like, everyone. They already repaid the free-money-if-you-rehire-your-old-employees-loan, in full, so they aren't fucking rehiring anybody. This company is going bankrupt. Earnings is today, BUY SOME PUTS. \n\nFuck: $ELY\n\nCallaway golf is firmly cemented in the top 2 golf brands in the world in every category. Except apparel. Golf clothes are ugly and no one seems to get this... people don't buy ugly clothes. This company overreached last year, buying multiple apparel brands and bringing them in house, and each choice was an act of self immolation. But fire is hot, and hot means fuckable. This stock dropped from $22.00 to $5 in mid-March, and if you were smart like me, you knew it wasn't going bankrupt and made 300% back to-date on SHARES. It's under $14, still a buy 100%. They report earnings TONIGHT. I recommend buying some shares, 6-8  month time horizon before they recover to \\~$19 which is historically a strong resistance for the stonk. Options on this are low volume and I wouldn't recommend, but maybe sell OTM puts to your friends. \n\nMarry: $GOLF\n\nTHis is Titleist. Titleist is 3rd in terms of golf club sales, but super duper #1 in ball sales. They had a down couple of years IMO bc Costco employees stole material and printed 'Kirkland' on the balls and sold them for half price (fucking hilarious story, btw). Now the lawsuit is really humming along and $GOLF is back at its all time high. No other company will ever make a ball that competes with the Pro V1.

{"title": "$SONO 1/22 $12.50 - Hear me out.", "selftext": "For such a big \"miss\" Sonos hasn't really fallen much, especially compared to yesterday's gains. 1/22 $12.50 leaps were surprisingly cheap yesterday, and only a bit cheaper today (for such a long time horizon).\n\nI don't know if the options are well priced / ideally priced, but I'm not going to play that game. What I'm interested in is how likely will this stock be > $12.50 by Jan. 2022.\n\n**100% chance it will be greater than $12.50 before 1/22.**\n\nWhere it will be at 1/22, I don't really care. If there's some semblance of profit greater than my threshold, than I'm happy. FWIW, if I see > 80% return in less than a week, that's a great place to start taking profit. If I see > 400% return in < 12 months, I'm out, until it makes sense to be in again.\n\n**TL;DR:** SONO 1/22 @$12.50. (bought yesterday before earnings).\n\nI'm not going to eat anything or do anything if it's a good play - because that's ridiculous.\n\nI'm not going to eat anything or do anything if it's a bad play - because that's WSB-level ridiculous.\n\n[Minimal TA](https://preview.redd.it/1m33q9sw4ex41.png?width=2508&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba383d82e2bb57d10fb5fbbff5dd8cfdb37ec6a4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Addendum:** Sonos could have eaten it so many years ago. The fact is, despite the growth in Apple and Google branded smart home speakers, Sonos is still the only comprehensive sound system / product out there. It's got a VERY loyal fan base (even despite the BS sunsetting of support) and it's got a big sticky factor. Once you get one, you're very likely to keep adding to your room / cave / closet / juice factory / mega mansion.\n\nI do believe they've been fairly treated by the market. Their Direct to Consumer approach has been pretty crappy - but that's compared to Google and Apple. This matters more than ever right now because DTC is the only real way to sell consumer goods right now. If Sonos got hit hard due to inventory issues with its big box suppliers, then so did everyone else. Compared to the big (but lower quality) players out there like Bose, Vizio, Samsung, Sonos dominates them in DTC.\n\nWe know DTC works because Amazon, Peloton, Overstock and Wayfair have been killing it. AMZN is cheating because of cloud services...but people are stuck home and they're buying stuff.\n\nFinancially, Sonos is also in a good spot. From their most recent 10-Q, they've got 283MM in unrestricted cash/liquid investments. They've got 213MM in current liabilities, so they're not in huge danger of insolvency (especially with their current inventories). If you add in their LT Debt of $21MM, they're still in good shape re: Asset / Liabilities.\n\nAll this to say ... SONO long term is a good risk / reward payoff. Feel free to YOLO if you want - but I think that's ridiculous. It's more likely that you can get 5, 100% returns over 12 months in the same stock than you can a 500% return in 1 stock in < 1 month.
