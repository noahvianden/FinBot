{"title": "A Promising Options Trade - Smartsheet", "selftext": "Hey all, I've been lurking for the past few months and wanted to start posting and getting your thoughts on options trades.\n\nI was looking at technology companies that have a potentially long runway up - ideally those well-suited to take advantage of COVID while not being overly exposed to potential recession conditions. I found that Smartsheets is reporting earnings June 3rd, and their stock has not increased to the level we've seen other tech companies rise in the past few weeks (read: not priced in). Their Q1 earnings report also includes April, so the influx of people using Smartsheets due to COVID will show up on earnings and growth.\n\nTheir fundamentals are solid - they're still a growth stock, but they have a lot of runway. They've also been doing the \"growth\" part incredibly well, with 90% of the S&P500 as paying customers. If you look at the options volume for June 19th, calls vastly outweigh puts by *90%*, suggesting some early birds are seeing potential here (or insiders!).\n\nIntuitively, it's a great stock. If you were Manager Joe in the office yesterday, you could walk over to your underlings' desks to lay down a deadline for a report next week.

{"title": "$BILI-NG $BILI-NG This Dragon is a Green Rocket Ready for Launch", "selftext": "Alright you cum-guzzling degenerate gamblers, here's a great damn opportunity for a big green dick to slap you in the face, so listen up.\n\n$BILI is a Chinese media company that operates the Bilibili video-sharing platform and produces mobile games for a Chinese audience. They specifically focus on catering to Gen Z kids in China who play those \"officially licensed\" mobile games that are pay-to-win, and Bilibili the platform is primarily centered on gaming and animations, though it has expanded recently to include more areas of interest. Think of it as Chinese Youtube, if Youtube wasn't the monopoly it is and instead was just the biggest fish in the pond. Like Youtube, they also have a live-streaming component that allows people to donate to streamers, while Bilibili takes a cut.\n\nI dumbed it down for you morons but you should get what this means. Same logic behind why gaming companies boosted; people are spending more time on their phones playing games and consuming content. That means more ads are being seen, more in-game purchases are being made, more people have more time to simp for e-girls and pay for other degenerates to play videogames they're too lazy to play.\n\nNow I know what you're thinking. $LK. Some of you dolts got burned when that coffee cup fell over in your lap, and now you think every Chinese company that moons is a test of how well you can edge. Well if this was another Luckin' Coffee, would Sony invest hella money? No! So shut the fuck up! Cause that's exactly that they did, Sony bought a stake of $BILI worth $400 M. That's no small-cock move considering that BILI's market cap is just above $10 B. And they print too. BILI has consistently posted annual revenue growth, with FY 2019 ending with revenue just under $1 B. In the last quarter alone, BILI had almost $300 M in revenue, one of their most successful quarters yet. Furthermore, as revealed on the 2019 SEC filing, BILI has made continuous efforts to diversify their business and this effort has clearly paid off considering the rapid growth in BILI's other sectors.\n\nBut wait, there's more! This week, BILI reached an ATH of 31.17, and that's only two weeks after the COVID-19 crash in March brought it to a low of $25. Since it's IPO at $9.80 in 2018, BILI has gone up 212% and looks intent on keeping that momentum up even despite 'rona bringing the markets down. Even since January of 2020, BILI has gained $8 to hit $30 per share, and a positive earnings for this quarter could easily send it up further. Point being, my fellow addicts, there's a green dragon on the side of the next moon launch.\n\nUnfortunately BILI only has monthlies, so option action is limited BUT there should be a run up to earnings. I'm bullish on BILI's future in the long term since I think they are well placed to corner the Chinese video-sharing market, so even taking long calls on $BILI may be desirable.T hey report AH on Monday 5/18. I've got my 6/19 40c and my tickets to tendie heaven, and there's plenty of room on this rocket.\n\nTL;DR: $BILI 6/19 calls. Personally I have 40c. $BILI's stake in online media in China, thanks to COVID, should see a nice increase. They're damn solid and look like they've got room to grow\n\nDisclaimer: None of the above is financial advice.

The lockdown has lasted much, much longer than anyone expected and most people/families have been eating three square meals a day at home (not to mention stress eating).  Price peaked in March at $34.19 and just started revisiting that level yesterday but I don’t believe that two and a half months of every person in America grocery shopping for themselves and their families for every meal has been close to priced in.\n\nDespite the economy re-opening, restaurants are taking much longer and in many cases only doing take out/pick up.

Again, this means eating at home and a sustained bump in sales.\n\nKR has spent the last 6 years making big moves to automated factories and bolstering online ordering.

Well look no further than Wells Fargo the perennial loser about financials.   The financials , represented by XLF, are not beloved right now as they are being slammed by lower interest rates and also stricter loan requirements in everything from home loans to autos.  \n\nIt is one of the weakest among the primary dealers - exceeded only by Deustcheland Bank whose woes are a topic for another discussion- so if you include only American banks then it is #1 on the list.  \n\nThe stock has been under pressure due to dividend cut fears.  The concerns about a dividend cut has hit Wells Fargo particularly hard because it has one of the highest payout ratios among banks making it beloved by Boomers and fund managers.  Wells Fargo's current annual dividend rate of $2.08 a share implies a dividend yield of 8.48%. That compares with the yield for the financial XLF of 2.87% and the implied yield for the S&P 500 index of 2.05%, according to FactSet.   This is not sustainable.    If capital is an issue (which it is at any business) then it makes sense to save it instead of spending it on investors.\n\nWFC has also been up today on rumors that GS will buy them out.

(JPM) analyst Vivek Juneja, Business Insider reported.*     \n\n*Business Insider reported that in a note on Thursday, Juneja said that the combined deposit market share of the two banks would go past the regulatory limit. In a separate report, MarketWatch said Juneja reiterated his underweight rating on the stock and said a takeover by a bank of Wells Fargo would be \"banned by law.\"*     \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, WFC has bounced back today in intra-day trading ( so far to around 8.5-9%). The stock had plunged 24.9% during a 10-day stretch in which it fell nine times, to close Wednesday at the lowest price since June 2009.             \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chalkin Money Flow captures institutional selling of WFC shares as fund managers continue to dump it.

Anything can happen and it is possible but I think it is unlikely.  \n\nEDIT:\nHere is an article from Barron's addressing this point in more color.  \nMy personal opinion is also that any kind of bank merger takes MONTHS to happen and multiple rounds of regulators and meetings.  Very unlikely in this economy.  Also a merger would require WFC to dump their client book which they just spent a ton of time and money rebuilding after the fraud scandals. \n\nWall Street  is expecting a wave of consolidation in the banking sector once the coronavirus pandemic passes, but there's one merger it isn't banking on:  Goldman Sachs  joining forces with  Wells Fargo .\nThe possibility of a  Goldman Sachs  (ticker: GS) and  Wells Fargo  (WFC) emerged via a Fox Business report late Wednesday. The report noted that the makeup of many  Wall Street  banks could look different as companies consider easing their  New York City  footprint, opting to reduce their exposure to high- density -- and highly expensive -- cities, in accordance with social distancing guidelines.\nBuried in that report was also the notion that  Goldman Sachs , itching to boost its retail presence as trading operations have become less profitable, may be looking to merge with  Wells Fargo .  PNC Financial Services  (PNC) was also listed as a possibility for a  Goldman Sachs  tie-up.\n\n Goldman Sachs  declined to comment,  Wells Fargo  didn't immediately respond to requests to comment.\nWhile the  Wells Fargo  deal makes sense strategically -- an investment bank combining with a commercial bank would be a formidable competitor to  JPMorgan Chase  (JPM) -- analysts aren't seeing it.\nThis deal is a \"non-starter,\"  Vivek Juneja , analyst at  JPMorgan , said in a note Wednesday, citing  Wells Fargo's  Federal Reserve-mandated asset cap and restrictions on mergers between banks that have more than 10% of U.S. deposit market share.  Wells Fargo  is believed to have already exceeded that cap.\n\n\"We also expect that  Wells Fargo's  numerous legal and regulatory issues and recent rebukes by regulators for its lack of progress in remediating its multiple consent orders will not allow for any deals involving  Wells Fargo ,\" Juneja wrote.\nWhile mergers may soon be in the air -- PNC recently hinted at being on the hunt after unloading its  BlackRock  (BLK) stake -- don't count on  Goldman Sachs  and  Wells Fargo  joining forces.\n Wells Fargo  shares popped 4.7% on Thursday,  Goldman Sachs  was down 1.8%.\nWrite to  Carleton English  at carleton.english@dowjones.com\n\n  (END) Dow Jones Newswires\n   05-14-20   1113ET \n  Copyright (c) 2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don’t know who would have to make a change to the 10% deposit cap.

But on Sunday, Powell, while        acknowledging that the economy may take time to recover, again threw        cold water on the notion of negative rates.     \n\n\"The evidence on whether it helps is quite mixed,\" Powell said in an        interview with 60 Minutes. \"It can also tend to depress the        profitability of banks, which makes them likely to lend less, which        weighs on economic growth. So I would just say it's not at all settled        in, you know, in economic analysis that negative rates really add much        value.\"     \n\nBank stocks soared early Monday, with the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (BKX)        climbing 6.6%, outpacing gains in S&P 500, which was up        3.2%. Shares of JPMorgan        (JPM) were up 4.6%, Citigroup        (C), up 6.4%, Bank of America        (BAC), up 5.2%, and Wells Fargo        (WFC), up 6.9%.     \n\nIt was a rare bullish day for the banks, whose stocks have slid since        February even though many -- including Powell -- have highlighted the        health of the sector.     \n\n\"After the last financial crisis, the banks more than doubled their        capital and liquidity and they're far more aware and better at managing        the risks they're taking,\" Powell said, referring to the financial        crisis of 2008-09. \" They're so much stronger than they were before the        financial crisis, the last financial crisis.\"     \n\nInvestors may have less fear about banks going under, but they know        profits will be weak. Many banks have halted buybacks and some dividends        may be under pressure. One needs to look no further than the performance        of bank bonds compared with their stocks to witness this split sentiment        on the sector.     \n\nBefore Monday's rally, bank stocks were down roughly 40% since        February's market high while the S&P 500 was down roughly        16%.     \n\nCredit default swap spreads for the nation's biggest banks, including JPMorgan,        Goldman Sachs (GS), and Wells        Fargo soared in early March, but returned to normal levels later        that month on monetary and fiscal stimulus, according to an analysis by Keefe,        Bruyette & Woods.     \n\n\"While bond investors have sent positive signals about banks, equity        investors have not,\" Frederick Cannon, managing        director at KBW, said in a note. \"If there is consistency between bond        and equity investors, this suggests that market participants overall        believe that bank balance sheets are safe, but that bank profitability        has been put at significant risk.\"     \n\nUnfortunately, history is not a reliable guide to when bank stocks will        see outperformance during the recovery. KBW identified 12 market        downturns since 1997, and found that in the three months following the S&P        500's trough, bank stocks' performance ranged from losing 11.5% to        gaining as much as 52.8%.     \n\n\"Our analysis suggests that the bank stocks should be near a bottom if        solvency issues remain off the table. However, this is not to say that        banks will necessarily be strong relative outperformers,\" Cannon wrote.     \n\nWrite to Carleton English at [carleton.english@dowjones.com](mailto:carleton.english@dowjones.com) \n\n (END) Dow Jones Newswires   05-18-20 1243ET", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
