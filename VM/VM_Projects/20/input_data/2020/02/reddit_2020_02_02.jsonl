The Vega Greek follows IV and premium will change based on a 1% move on IV. \n\nSo I'm looking at the IV studies for the charts on recent earnings like Amazon, Microsoft, FB, etc. The morning open after earnings the IV immediately drops. By a few percentages. Even on Amazon it dropped. Yet I saw quite a few posts of people profiting BIGLY who bought a call right before close and sold the next morning.\n\nMy question was where was the IV crush effect. Was there one? I'm assuming it's because the stock went up so much that the move in Delta (premium increase per dollar move) offset the move in Vega? Amazon moved \\~$150 and IV only dropped 2%. As I'm typing this I feel I just said the answer but options can be tricky and I just want to make sure that I'm not missing anything. So I apologize if I look like an idiot as you read this. I just want to be as sure as I can in understanding this.\n\nDo you just need to be confident that the stock will move enough to offset the potential IV crush? \n\nThank you.", "id": "exjr1d", "created_utc": 1580621815.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "With a big enough move, the delta can overcome the Vega.

The higher \"insurance IV\" means more premium is charged for coverage. \n\nSo on earnings day we find out if the market properly priced the move.   In the case of AMZN, it sounds like the stock moved more than was priced in.   If the move was less than expected, a call might not have broke even, or would have profited less.  When you're trading earnings you should have an opinion about what the market is pricing in and trade with that in mind.\n\nThere is another thing worth mentioning about earnings IV.  If you're trading the near expiration option, the change in IV, Vega, isn't as significant.  Going back to the car insurance analogy, it cost more to insure a car for 12 months than it does for 6.  You can imagine that insuring a car for only a week would be cheaper still.  Since the time frame on a week long policy is lower, the impact of that insurance IV is lower too, even though it's still higher for the sports car.
