However, from CBOE's website, it seems that their PUT index seems to be losing to the SPX here. Understand that there has been a strong bull market recently. Hence, was just wondering, is there any value in spending all that time and effort trading puts on the index when the return is so similar, if not less in the long run?\n\nLink for those interested:\n\n[http://www.cboe.com/delayedquote/advanced-charts?ticker=PUT](http://www.cboe.com/delayedquote/advanced-charts?ticker=PUT) ", "id": "f7nqdi", "created_utc": 1582346705.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 17, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Good to see you're still around!
