Still can’t find any FDA approvals.\n\nEdit: Here’s the full scoop per Yahoo Finance\n\nANN ARBOR, Mich., Feb. 11, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zomedica Pharmaceuticals Corp. (NYSE American: ZOM)(“Zomedica” or “Company”), a veterinary diagnostic company, announced today that the Company has filed a U.S. patent application covering compositions and methods for five fecal parasite detection assays for detecting parasitic infections in cats and dogs designed for use with its ZM-020 pathogen detection device. The patent application details optimal fecal sample amounts for parasite infection detection. In early 2019 Zomedica previously submitted a U.S. provisional patent application covering compositions and methods for detecting urinary tract infections (UTIs) designed for use with its ZM-020 pathogen detection platform to detect urinary tract infections in dogs and cats. The initial library of pathogens for urine samples is focused on the identification of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas bacteria species and three types of crystals and white blood cells. The initial library of pathogens for fecal samples is focused on the identification of hookworms, roundworms, whipworms, coccidia and giardia.\n\nThe assays are intended to be used with the ZM-020 pathogen detection device which is a miniaturized Raman spectroscopy platform capable of broad-based pathogen identification in minutes. The technology used in the ZM-020 device, which is currently being developed by Seraph Biosciences, Inc. (“Seraph”) has the potential to achieve reference lab sensitivity/specificity in-clinic during the point-of-care experience, which could result in better pet outcomes and faster recovery. The ZM-020 diagnostic platform requires a small fecal sample preparation.  Additionally, the platform has automated analysis and does not require specialized staff training. Assuming development work is successfully completed Zomedica expects the commercial launch of the ZM-020 fecal test to occur by 2022 and urine tests by 2023. Zomedica is strategically committed to a singular commercial focus of its endocrine diagnostic platform, TRUFORMA™ through 2021.\n\n\nIt’s currently dipping, waiting so I can purchase some for long term.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "This post is 100% fake.

{"title": "Buy VSLR/RUN/SEDG/ENPH and how they are different from FSLR - Complete DD", "selftext": "First and foremost, I have followed the energy sector for quite some time so I'll give my thoughts on what I see with the aforementioned stocks and the trajectory as a whole.\n\nThis was my post some several months ago when ENPH had it's big ITC drop; needless to say, I bought the dip but without much capital at the time. \n\n [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpce9k/enph\\_could\\_be\\_your\\_next\\_success\\_story/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpce9k/enph_could_be_your_next_success_story/)\n\nThat being said, let's jump in on the DD.\n\nThis year should be a great year for energy/green stocks with the rapid shifting of tech companies towards fully electric and renewable energy sources (namely TSLA, Intel, MSFT, Google, Apple, etc - all of which use solar energy as part of their operations). Considering the growth of the solar industry in the last year as well as software-driven solar tech, the energy market is consistently finding new opportunities to increase exposure in the greater market and making meaningful partnerships. Take for example Sun Power, which is one of the largest distributors of solar panels in the U.S, Phillips which is working on a sustainable energy source for TSLA vehicles, PLUG which is making deals with Amazon, Walmart, and potentially Home Depot. In fact, the U.S in 2019 has increased this sector's employment by 250,000 jobs in just Florida alone, and an increase in 31 states. Employment rate is oftentimes  a great predictor for an industry's health and outlook. Moreover, legislation such as CA Title 24 mandate requires all homes built after 2020 to have solar PV installed, and prior to this, following Lennar, Toll Brothers, and KBH, every new property developed in the last 2 years have solar installed and software-solar tech (automated thermostats). Another thing to consider is the cutting of door-to-door sales in many solar tech companies, and focusing on consultants that build partnerships for these companies. Vehicles are also starting to move into solar tech, with TSLA being the obvious front runner, but also fully electric Jaguars, MUSTANGS, and Audi's, all of which have never produced any fully electric, or even hybrid vehicles up until the recent years. The demand for solar is high and traditional energy providers (fossil fuels and standard energy providers) are starting to lose marketshare in the energy sector. This is mainly as a result of the growing issues and litigations over high winds, faulty equipment, and fires. If you take a look at solar installations, you will see a clear trend:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStarts with ITC incentives have been very favorable towards these solar companies, and with the tiered tax credit incentive system that depreciates each year, people are incentivized to get this tech sooner than later. What the ITC means (for those that don't know), it's the investment tax credit which is a 26% federal tax deduction for installing solar tech in your home. And as the full electric auto market grows, there is a substantially larger percentage of residents that will have these installed. For those buying new homes this year and forward, they will come fully furnished. \n\nThere are lots of catalyst in this space, everything from the automotive industry, real estate industry, software tech industry, ITC, and general move towards renewable energy. Cloud based platforms will require an immense amount of energy to run these cloud servers, and MSFT/Amazon are already all over solar tech. This area is also just starting to develop rapidly. \n\nMy picks are, from most optimistic to least:\n\nVSLR, RUN, SPWR, ENPH, SEDG \n\nAlso, for those that are discussing FSLR, it was a huge miss but imo analyst had no reason to lift EPS this high and guidance last quarter was far too optimistic. One big reason why I believe FSLR failed is that they are the only utility-scale distributor in the mix. That means they only work with utility companies to provide energy on large grids, however, they do not fit into the category or have partnerships with commercial or residential units. Moreover, as utility companies are beginning to lose marketshare and are losing the trust of customers (especially in CA), I can only imagine that FLSR partnerships are suffering. Anyway, I lost money on my calls which will probably be at -90% at open. I thought it would ride the energy wave, but I was wrong. \n\nAlso, WSB auto hid this post. lol", "id": "f769dz", "created_utc": 1582261612.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "Sedg has saved my account two days in a row now.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "VSLR seems interesting.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "It’s a good place to enter consider the entire market is pretty much resetting", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I made a post asking about it, but the few people that commented seemed to poop on it.
