As for why they can charge these margins, it's because grid installations of batteries can literally be a money printing machine. Just look at the Australia installation, it paid for itself in like a year, so Tesla can charge 50-70% margins and the customer makes all their money back in a year, that's a killer business. \n\nElon has also said that they have a roadmap to ramp battery capacity from current 34GWh per year to up to 2 TWh per year, that's a 58x increase in production.

It sounds like this is something they want to offer as cheap as possible, and maybe at a slight loss just to make it easier for customers. But that's a 10x price differences from the grid installations for the same capacity. In theory you could probably take a bunch of Model 3 battery packs and stick them in a box, attach positive/negative wires (from a solar farm) and it would work pretty much the same as a powerwall. There's just no way costs can actually be 10x higher so the margins gotta be pretty high. \n\nI think the biggest problem today is that battery storage simply isn't available, Tesla doesn't really have the batteries to do it and only way they consider doing it is by charging ludicrous margins. What final price will land and what demand will be is very hard to say, especially now when we don't know anything before battery day. \n\nWhat I know, is that there's a threshold, probably somewhere between $100 - $400 where batteries just makes coal, gas, nuclear obsolete and there's trillions of dollars of invested dollar in those power plants that grid operators would want to shift into battery storage, TO MAKE MONEY.

That article is local so I’m pretty sure that’s $71m Australian dollars ( circa $49m USD). To be fair that’s a cost basis of $753/kWh and would work back to gross profit margin of circa 71% based on my crude calc. I must admit I’m surprised by that high level.\n\nThe reason why I felt that 35% gross margin was more realistic as I’d also compared the industry market calcs I’d done against the Q3 2019 Tesla quarterly revenues. In the accounts energy storage and solar gets bundled together so it’s hard to break them out. Q3 2019 only had 43MW solar deployed and gross margin across the sector was $402m/$314m ~ 28% margin. However 2019 Q2 had even lower solar generation and that was circa 13% margin.\n\nI think going forwards Tesla will definitely iterate on their battery and upscale production so they can tend to $50/kWh but so will the rest of the industry. In my opinion Tesla is currently a leader in car batteries which require instant power generation and higher energy density. Stationary storage isn’t quite as constrained and generally other battery producers are much closer to Tesla.
