I felt that this forced me to trade realistic positions AND made the trades much more relevant: each loss felt like a real loss since the loss position was a relatable value.\n\n• I’ve actually kept bad trades on the account, I’ve not erased or adjusted anything. I’ve been pretty consistent in using TOS’ trade notes (I generally note the entry price, size, and hypothesis as well as exit price, p/l, and conclusions). It has hurt quite a bit (like getting absolutely slaughtered when trying to learn the put side of the game), but it’s kept me honest and I’ve learned a lot more than I otherwise would have.\n\n• Thank you for this fourth point in particular! My initial trading was scattered through a number of companies, mostly featured on the S&P 500. I’d trade on upward price movement weighted against trade value base on discounted cash flows. As you could imagine, most companies were overvalued, so that financial analysis was a bit of a futile exercise (though for standard securities trading, I’ll likely keep pursuing this).\nTSLA was an admittedly risky venture, but within my trading plan parameters. I bought a long OTM debit spread with the exercise date set for their stock split date. Came out ahead on that by $27k, mostly due to my early entry into the position. Quick math would tell you that trade was snot only fortunate, but that I also suffered quite a few losses along the way to my $40k profit during the 3 mos period. This is what forced me to focus on trading SPY instead of my previously frivolous smattering of companies in the SPY.\nSPY did deliver a HUGE loss (I think it was in the neighborhood of 5 digits) on a position in October, but I was persistent in the strategy and am now $15k YTD, trading contracts 3x a week.\nI’d be interested on your thoughts regarding this.

I use a TDAm IRA to swing trade, as there is no fees/commissions and no capital gains. I have the app and the web page connected to a system that has all my resources laid out, so I can trade from my mobile or research well-enough from a desk. That's my set-up.  My accounts are kept different so my focus can be different for each account, managing my behavior in trading; they are also kept different to allow easy accounting and management based on their strengths. I suggest doing the same.\n\nSecondly, you have to have a non-sentimental mentality towards trading, and lots of tools to make smart trades. You're hoping to beat the market by timing it, which demands an advanced enough knowledge of the stocks you swing, and the market, to make sure your 'time in' isn't better spent. I use a secondary account to swing trade, so I stay non-sentimental in my positions and focused behaviorally on the goal of beating \"[mr.market](https://mr.market)\" by focusing on areas that can allow me to do that.\n\nYour positions are pretty great. I like your ETF selection. It's very growth oriented and low volatility, has a higher average cost (which is ok if they perform as expected), and good diversification with US staple companies, and just enough foreign market touch. It's a good investment portfolio so far, and not worth swing trading.\n\nAAPL, as previously mentioned, hold merits in being short (position) sold but also has growth potentials and history that make it a good hold/investment, provided you got it at a low enough price. For your portfolio and account, it would make more sense to dollar average on bad days with your $aapl.\n\nRKT seems to be a tech stock, with nice growth, but acts like a bank stock. It has high ROA, but little in the way of promising indicators showing good fundamentals in finances and long term stability. It has great P/S to be swing traded on an uptrend. I'd hold it for a year before selling it though (for tax reasons). Sell around $27-30. The alternative is hold until bank stocks make their comeback, and readjust strategy from there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy final advice is that you need to have multiple accounts, for different focuses and thus types of 'you'. Since you switched a single accounts focus in your mind three times - we've all done this too - you as the investor/trader seem to be the loose variable that needs to be sorted out, and not the positions you hold (this is the case for myself often, and almost everyone here). To prove this argument, I'll ask, if you knew exactly what to do would you not be better at doing it? Or better yet, if you knew what was going to happen with a stock, would you be confused at to long or short it? The reason I bring this up is that to swing trade, you do need to have enough knowledge of the stock and what will happen based on patterns, yourself and goal (being to swing trade), the market in general (as a trend), to be able to beat what is otherwise better time spent being 'in' on a good position. In that, its best to spend more time being a fundamental based value/growth investor, before you begin to swing trading without a built up base of knowledge and accountable purpose. I often attribute my success not to knowing the market well (though I do my due diligence), or to my intelligence and skill (which is average), but more so to my counter-intuitive goal of 'don't lose': while most swing trade 'to win big', when you play to 'not lose', the more conservative approach to opportunity comes in perfect pitches as opposed to a swing-and-miss batting average.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is so logical...

Some trades are for $800 profit, other for $30, but the big number at the end of the profit sheet that says \"total\" is the nice number that comes together with both big and little wins. I might be counting on big profits, knocking me up a thousand dollars or close to it, but I take a lot more little gains that add up overtime. It's the adding up over time part that makes up for the loss of benefits in long positions (like dividends).  \n\n\nLikewise, with the best accounts able to swing trade with, that of an IRA or something, you can only add so much into them a month, so you have to grow them from within somehow, to gain on their main benefit of being tax exempt in profit. Where the more you can put into a trade, the more you can make/lose on a trade, so you would naturally want more in the account to trade with so that you can make more. The only way to do that is through profitable trades, and many over time, to build up that account. \n\nThe realistic goal should be to make one 150% profit trade in one's life, a couple trades over 70%, a few over 50%, even more over 30%, but lots and lots of 5-20% gains over time. This slow accumulation is the only way to make easier the fast and large gains, but also grow the account in the most basic. As far as risk in concerned, as long as you never lose, you grow, and the best way to never lose and grow IS to actually have many small profits along the way; small profits hedge the lose of big shots, and accumulate the most and fastest over time towards the \"luck\" of having a windfall.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Absolutely\n\nWhen the market corrects itself you will have the opportunity to buy Apple at at least 90, if not lower\n\nIf you don't sell now then you will have to wait years to recover", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is a moronic idea", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks.
