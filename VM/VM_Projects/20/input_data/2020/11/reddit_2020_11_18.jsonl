{"title": "Buffet and Papa Musk anime crossover?", "selftext": "~@FrankPeelen (Not me, but DD checks out.)\n\nBased on data I gathered from 13F filings, a large number of TSLA shares seem to have gone missing during Q3, to the tune of 50M shares. \n\nThis is a large number of shares that can't be explained away by retail buying, delta hedging, and smaller institutional investors increasing their stakes.\n@s17_scott and Thekiwi on TMC pointed out to me that $BRK omitted one company from its 13F, and instead disclosed this newly acquired stake separately in a confidential filing, because it was worried that making the position public would move the market too much.\n\nAccording to this BI article: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-buying-secret-stock-revealed-coming-weeks-2020-11-1029813523, there is a $25B difference between the value of the portfolio $BRK declared in its 13F and its 10-Q ($220B vs $245B). In actuality, they declared $245.5B in their 10-Q and $229B in their 13F, a difference of $16.5B.\n\nThe BI article also mentions a $6B investment into 5 big Japanese trading companies made over a 12 month period, which was made public in early August, and which supposedly explains part of the disparity between the 13F and 10-Q.\n\nIndeed, there is also a disparity of $5B between $BRK's Q2 13F and 10-Q. In other recent quarters, the differences were:\n\nQ2'20: $202.5B vs $207.5B = $5B\nQ1'20: $175.5B vs $180.5B = $5B\nQ4'19: $242B vs $248B = $6B\n\nSo the current $16.5B difference is not normal.\nThe BI article also mentions this has happened once before in Q2'15, when $BRK reported $110.5B in equity holdings in its 10-Q vs $107B in its 13F, a difference of $3.5B, only to file an amendment 3 weeks later, worth $2.5B.\n\nAssuming that $5-6B of the current $16.5B disparity is due to the investment in the Japanese trading giants, what can the other $11B be attributed to? Could $BRK's currently confidential new investment be $TSLA?\n\nAnother important piece of information is the size of this position, and implications it has on 13D/13G filings. Companies have to disclose an acquisition of a 5%+ stake in a company within 10 days to the SEC. So unless $BRK was also allowed to keep this confidential...this means the $11B must be less than 5% of the company in which it was invested. That means the company's market cap must be >$220B, which really limits the options. There are only 25 such companies listed on US exchanges: https://www.dogsofthedow.com/largest-companies-by-market-cap.htm\n\nFurthermore, $BRK already owns stock in 9 of them, and is 1 of them:\n\n1) $AAPL\n2) $AMZN\n3) $BRK\n4) $V\n5) $JNJ\n6) $JPM\n7) $PG\n8) $MA\n9) $BAC\n10) $KO\n\nThere are only 15 other $220B+ companies listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ\n\nNone of this proves anything, but when combined with the ~50M $TSLA shares that went missing in Q3, there are some strong signs showing $BRK's mystery new investment could be $TSLA.\n\nIf it is $TSLA, this $11B would amount to ~25M shares at the stock price at the end of Q3 ($429), and would go a long way towards explaining the ~50M missing $TSLA shares. 50M shares can't be explained away by retails, small institutions, and delta hedging, but...\n25M can, especially with 25M shares worth of buying pressure pushing up the stock price as much as it did in Q3, because a rising stock price requires a lot of shares to be bought for delta hedging purposes, as I've explained in my blog previously:\n\nhttps://teslainvestor.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-mechanisms-that-fueled-tslas.html\n\nSo did $BRK acquire a large stake in $TSLA? There's no proof, but it seems very plausible. We should find out for sure what $BRK's mystery new acquisition is over the next few weeks or months.", "id": "jwif1h", "created_utc": 1605715411.0, "score": 67, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Please get this to mainstream media so my calls don‚Äôt die", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Pumping TSLA, just like God had intended?", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "So TSLA calls?", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "500c let's go", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "What is this, a crossover episode?", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "I mean this is damn good research, but it would be so contrary to Buffett's history, I will need to see it before I believe it.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "When would we know what Jimmy Buffet bought?

In total at least 1 Mio calls for 100 Mio shares. Possibly more. Call strike will be share price at the time +10%.\n2. On December 11, majority of index funds will buy TSLA, driving the price up. Also MM will buy TSLA because they sold the fucking calls.\n3. Once share price exceeds break even, large player will all start to exercise and sell to the index funds in small tranches until MM run dry.\n4. Now its squeeze time.\n5. Index funds might slow down because float runs dry but MM must continue buying. Guess who got some juice left? Our hero Softbank.\n6. Softbank will continue to exercise. Forcing MM to buy shares at ANY price. Selling the shares back to MM, but not all, just enough to cover expenses of exercising! This will effectively reduce float until share price becomes ridiculous and MM are fucked in the process.\n7. WSB Autists sell shares at $5000 a piece. And deep ITM calls or something.\n8.

{"title": "American Outdoor Brands (AOBC)", "selftext": "AOBC (ticker: AOUT)\n\nListen up degenerates as I have an easy 65% gainer(commons) or 2200% for your December calls:  \n\nAOBC (ticker: AOUT) was spun out from SWBI in August.  AOBC was valued at $250M per investor deck and independent valuations (see SEC filings).  This $250M value corresponded to the value of AOBC‚Äôs assets in the SWBI consolidated financial statements at 4/30/20.  AOBC is currently valued at market cap of 208M which represents 17% discount to book value.  This is good for a boomer return, but not the lotto ticket we are all looking for.  Here‚Äôs the hidden secret.....\n\nIn it‚Äôs 4/30/20 year end financials SWBI took a $98M impairment charge against the intangible assets of the AOBC business.  The impairment was calculated in March (GW impairment testing was triggered by overall market sell off) and was based on forecasts of sales and cash flows at that time in the unknown COVID world.  Why does that matter?  Amazon is the largest retailer of AOBC products and what was Amazon  only selling in March?  ‚ÄúEssential‚Äù products such as toilet paper and tampons.  Other brick and mortar retail outlets were also closed at that time thus severely impacted cash flow forecasts. All of this information is in the FY 20 10-K filing and SEC filings if you want to fact check .  Fast forward to today -  RGR, SPWH, BGFV, VSTO. Etc. are reporting record demand for outdoor products, guns, and accessories. This means it‚Äôs extremely likely that sales are at least as strong or likely even better than in February 2020.  Reasonable argument is therefore AOBC is at least worth book value prior to the one-off impairment taken because of COVID.  Based on my analysis, AOBC should have a market cap of at least $350M (pre- impairment value) or even higher which equates to $25+/share.  At current stock price of $15/share this stock should return at least 66%.\n\nTo top it off,  the company is not going to disappoint in its first quarterly report.  The execs with juicy unvested stock rewards will not let that happen.\n\nAOBC reports it‚Äôs first separate company quarterly results in early December.  Look for this to be the üöÄ event that puts this under the radar small cap stock back on the map.  \n\nTLDR:  buy commons of AOBC and sell at $25 if you are a boomer.  If you want to get rich(er), Buy the December $17.5C for .35  and sell them at $8 after the rip back to FMV. \n\nYou‚Äôre welcome", "id": "jwqlzk", "created_utc": 1605740476.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "Nasdaq ticker appears to be AOUT...", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.
