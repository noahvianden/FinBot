Boomers are just waiting for a recovery and have doubled up on it. \n\n* One of the underlying stocks is Chevron (NYSE: CVX) Chevron is engaged in every aspect of the oil, natural gas, including hydrocarbon exploration and production; refining, marketing and transport; chemicals manufacturing and sales; and power generation\n\n* This includes the aspect of Fractional Distillation which has reduced in demand than normal during covid due to exportation issues. \n\n* To go deeper, fractional distillation is used for: Bitumen for roads and roofing. | Fuels for ships, factories and central heating. | Lubricating oils, waxes, and polishes. | Diesel fuels (many of the trains around the world still use this). | Jet fuel, paraffin for lighting and heating. (Airlines are starting to pick up in demand and many have started taking in bookings to prepare for flights &amp;gt; more consumption of jet fuels). | Petrol for vehicles (reduction in demand for this due to EVs and hybrids but this is the only aspect). | Chemicals. | Liquefied petroleum gas. \n\n* Biden supports renewable energy, but he would make sure the old money gets their run, as old money still runs the economy. - Leading to recovery. \n\n* Roads are still using to use refined crude oil despite the EV market. \n\n* These companies within these EFTs have invested heavily into solar energy, supporting sustainability, and adapting to changing markets. Which Biden is known for. \n\n* In terms of Leveraged EFT/Stocks = UCO (leveraged crude oil) used to be the reliable one but they changed their method to investment method because they couldn‚Äôt survive March 2020, so these are the best alternatives.  \n\n* All companies within the EFT are reducing greenhouse gas emissions \n\n* It‚Äôs 3x leverage, what do you expect, high risk high reward. \n\n* Recovery Stock\n\n\n**Risk:**\n\n* Leveraged Stocks and ETFs are high risk high reward plays but cannot liquidate such as a leveraged/options contracts\n\n* Gives common stock buyers and holders a high risk opportunity play. \n\n* TQQQ recovered higher than it did recover and that‚Äôs leveraged Nasdaq, this is due to percentage growth\n\n* Leveraged Stocks and ETFs are high risk high reward plays this will include drawdowns.

For example, ETFs that track the [S&P 500 Index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sp500.asp) will contain the 500 stocks in the S&P. Typically, if the S&P moves 1%, the ETF will also move by 1%.\n\nA leveraged ETF that tracks the S&P might use financial products and debt that magnify each 1% gain in the S&P to a 2% or 3% gain. The extent of the gain is contingent on the amount of leverage used in the ETF. Leveraging is an investing strategy that uses borrowed funds to buy options and futures to increase the impact of price movements.\n\nHowever, leverage can work in the opposite direction as well and lead to losses for investors. If the underlying index falls by 1%, the loss is magnified by the leverage. Leverage is a double-edged sword meaning it can lead to significant gains, but it can also lead to significant losses. Investors should be aware of the risks to leveraged ETFs since the risk of losses is far higher than those from traditional investments.
