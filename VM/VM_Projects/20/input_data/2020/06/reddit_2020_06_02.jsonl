A good story you keep telling yourself until the tide goes out and you see that little shrunken pecker of yours hiding under that belly Dunlap, wishing you hadn‚Äôt had been such a greedy chocha.üòÇüòÇ. I digress.\n\nNo one and I mean no one knows what a stock will do on a particular day, but but but but.....pump the breaks Karen.  Seatbelt that bitch.\n\nThere are two things that have given me MAJOR pause in DKNG and why I sold my long position today and went short @43 and change, I levered in and DCA into the close almost 50k shares, 46,700 because my broker couldn‚Äôt find them to short.\n\n1.  If you believe in the price action of DraftKings over the last week, then the owners of Draft Kings prior to the unique Initial offering got totally and utterly fucked by the underwriters.   Forgot about the exact dollars, the company has gone up over 400% in less than 2 months since become public, it totally fucked the original owners and made a shitload for the underwriters.   Our CEO wonder boy Jason Robins got royally ass jammed with no lube, he could have easily raised 2-3 times as much for the companies coffers so the company could expand.   No doubt his board of made men will be less than enthusiastic about this amateur hour fuck up.  It is nice to leave a little meat on the bone but this is a ass jamming with no lube of epic proportions where he gave away a huge amount of cash with his ‚Äúpipe‚Äù haha sorry had to laugh at that one- with one caveat - if you believe the price movement is real.  It‚Äôs not.\n\n2.  I do not believe the price movement is real, at least from the last $15 bucks or so.  $28-$44 is foo foo....Here is why....without getting into the dorky sounding snobbish I know more than you because I ran a hedge fund for nearly a decade - the price movement totally looks like computers pre programmed to buy and sell to each other.  Long and short back and forth creating a market with itself, not you.\n\nLooking at the blocks that sold all day today, it really jumped off the page at me...almost every single trade was a block of 100 that would jump as much as 18-21 cents ....there were hundreds if not thousands of instances where less than a thousand shares on the buy side were able to move the price up over 20 cents....that is Santa Clause unicorn shit and smells very much like a quant fart....what I‚Äôm trying to say is this....there are very few real buyers at this level...the shares seem to be the same recycled shares that were churning up all week....if you look at the level two quotes you will see these small block trades and the computers front run your orders and jump in front of your trade and make you chase the price like a grey hound chasing a rabbit....the price action does not look real to me, it looks like the computers colluded to conspire against the shorts and short squeeze the shit out of the bears all weak long.  \n\nOh what a tangled web we weave when we practice to deceive.  Bad computer.  Down boy.\n\nAnd one more little titbit - my broker had no shares to short and I had them out actively looking long and hard for me....

Kick and scream and fight the facts on this all you want...Trump inherited a very strong economy. Period. The labor market was incredibly tight, many firms struggled to find well qualified workers for jobs. The stock market was already in a late stage bull run. Second, the stock market and frankly the economy at large performs better under democratic administrations. That‚Äôs a 100% verifiable fact, just do some research on market trends and economic growth over the past 100 years and it‚Äôs very apparent. \n\nThe market over the past 3 years, at least pre Covid, has been very good! That I do not dispute. The banging 20%+ return in 2019 alone across major indices was excellent. The year before though had been close to flat. That being said, we need to remember that the stock market, over the long term, returns about +9% and change a year. Trumps 35% gain, pre Covid, was only marginally better than the average growth we‚Äôd expect to see over the same period of time. Trumps tax cuts did help boost share buy backs in a major way. This sort of assists in skewing results upwards though. If you buy back 10% of your outstanding shares, the remaining 90% will be more valuable and the price will rise. Nothing has fundamentally changed about the business itself yet share holders see a gain in price for the shares that they own, higher portion of earnings attributed to each share. This in turn makes it seem as if the same company who earned the 10 cents a share last year is now reporting 11 ish cents per share on the exact same amount of profit and revenue. \n\nAs for Tax cuts, the effect was minimal on most large public (and private for that matter) companies. Those firms already employed an army of accountants and attorneys to ensure they already paid a very low effective tax rate anyway. Smaller public, Russell 2000, had a much more significant effect as they did not have those resources. Is it worth adding an extra annual $1 trillion to our debt? In the long run, probably not. \n\nThe reason I don‚Äôt think a Biden election would suddenly tank the market is this. Yes, corporate taxes would certainly be going back up. But, Trumps trade wars and lack of a clearly defined economic and foreign policy objectives is bad for the U.S. and global economy. The man signed a free trade agreement with Mexico...and within a week was threatening to slap new tariffs on Mexico if they didn‚Äôt stop ‚Äústealing our auto workers jobs‚Äù....that isn‚Äôt stability, and the lack of ability to trust in the direction you want your economy to go hurts faith and trust even more broadly. No one wants to make a deal with you If you‚Äôll flip the script on a whim. Wake up one day and start a trade war over a Fox News piece you saw the night before. A Biden presidency would bring back a sense of consistency and clarity on Trade and direction, which would be a positive thing. won‚Äôt get into why even wanting all those manufacturing jobs back is a mistake from an economic point of view that‚Äôs a rant for another day...apologies for the long read, just got into this with someone recently and thought I‚Äôd share.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Biden has no idea how business works.
