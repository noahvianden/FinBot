Markets in US Market rally will loose steam in early", "selftext": "Traders this is a 48-hour trade going against the grain on elevated realized volatility and two-way large swings in the US Equity Indicies. These are Lotto Tickets (which means they are high risk/high reward, so you may lose all the premium you pay.) These are short-dated right-skewed popular weeklies, which have very high positive convexity, right-skewed returns, so they will explode today on a reversal after the European Close 12:30 pm. You will want to buy these Puts between 9:30 am and 11:30 am. You will want to sell these at the end of today (or as early as you are profitable) after the market reverses at 12:30 pm we may see equities rally back higher. I stress if you are closing in on profits in excess of 10%, 20%, 30%, etc relatively quickly make sure to reduce exposure and take profits. You can always reposition on the next reversal.\n\nThe markets will be moving fast. The implied moves are now near 2.51% - 3.14% this means wide swings UP and Down throughout the day. If you want to estimate the Gamma of Vol of Vol you can get an idea for how large the market is predicting the swings in the vix. The number should be in the range of 100 to 140 (or 6.2 to 8.8 up or down in the VIX today) Good Luck\n\nI will reiterate these are lotto tickets good for Today and Tomorrow. Buy into the early morning rally and make sure to sell these securities before the close today (with the option of holding into tomorrow up to the trader.) You should start to retain a profit following the initial morning rally and also European Close at 12:30 pm. - These are \"Lotto Tickets\" (popular speculative trades not long term investing) - The overall baseline stays the same we are in a few weeks of intense sell-off, but this will be a temporary reprieve, which will need to be faded  Good Luck ;)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will post positions at market open (so I will update this both)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust know I will be using this week's expiration 3/13/2020 and next week's 3/20/2020 (more liquidity in monthly)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBuy ATM on DIA, QQQ, SPY Puts at US market open 9:30 to 9:45\n\nBuy 1% OTM on DIA, QQQ, SPY Puts at US Market Open 9:30 to 10:30\n\nBuy 3% OTM on DIA, QQQ, SPY Puts at US Market Open 9:30 to 11:30\n\nMix them up however you would like with the 3/13/2020 expiration and the 3/20/2020 expirations\n\n\\*\\*\\*These are highly speculative lotto tickets\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Good luck \\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThese are all Puts\n\nSPY 3/13/2020 Strike 283 6.77\n\nSPY 3/13/2020 Strike 269 2.52\n\nSPY 3/18/2020 Strike 275 6.54\n\n&#x200B;\n\nQQQ 3/13/2020 Strike 195 2.67\n\nDIA 3/13/2020 Strike 240 4.20", "id": "fgdphj", "created_utc": 1583846454.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for this.
