They have plenty of cash on hand, can use the downtime to optimize the production process, and maybe try to fine tune things like the customer support process. Nobody is going to be shocked when sales are down in Q1-2, and they could be in a really good position for later in the year and beyond.\n\nPersonally, I think the true complexity of FSD has been badly underestimated. I'm a software developer, and I have some classes in AI as part of my degree, so I have a very skeptical attitude about the chances of success anytime soon. It's a really hard problem, and the first 3-4 attempts to solve it may fail. Sure, Tesla has some great people working on the issue, and lots of resources dedicated to it, so they might actually be the first to get it done.

If they push a big update to say a substantial portion of the U.S. fleet then I agree that in principle they could recognize a good chunk of the deferred FSD revenue.\n- Second, it appears to me that Tesla was HW3 production limited to a certain extent in Q1. They tried to pull the HW 2.5 trick at GF3 but got strong push-back from customers. This likely got resolved already, but the HW3 fleet retrofit effort is probably less complete than Tesla would like it - and FSD revenue with the HW3-only features can only be recognized if the customer has HW3 installed.\n- Third, not many have noticed, but Tesla already has a $140m chunk of deferred revenue with 100% profit margins set aside for Q1. (The FCA deal from 2019 which didn't get recognized in Q4.)\n\nSo there's really two outcomes I think: either the $140m ZEV upside from 2019 is already enough to make Q1 profitable - or North American and European Q1 delivery numbers are so bad that Tesla doesn't want to waste their FSD revenue on this quarter.\n\nThere's a nonzero chance for both outcomes - and expectations for Q1 deliveries have become rather bearish over the last month.\n\nOne of your recent articles in fact mentioned that there were a lot of cancellations in the U.S., sourced from the Tesla North American sales group, right? If that info is leaking then I suspect it's true and Q1 deliveries are worse than expected.\n\nI'm expecting 89,500 deliveries, but that might be optimistic too.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Great insights. thanks.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You are welcome!
