You're completely right here. The only way for Tesla to say that they've done all they could is when worker compensation leads the industry and the same goes for hours and safety. Improving on all those points is the easiest way to shut up critics. Failing to do so needlessly leaves the company open to this criticism, regardless of it being overplayed or not.  \nWhat plays against this, unfortunately, is that the company isn't exactly drowning in money quite yet. It's the correct aspiration to have but not as easy to implement. There's an argument to be made that, perhaps, companies who fail on this front shouldn't exist, but that's on regulators & enforcement & there are a lot of \"shoulds\" that aren't (including countries dragging their feet on sustainable energy) because we don't live in an ideal world. The other thing is that Musk is a known and notorious workoholic, and sadly seems to expect his employees to be just as driven. It remains to be seen if he will improve working conditions once that path becomes easier for the companies to take.\n\n> customer service\n\nHard to tell.

Oh and love the dig at the execs making 80 mil this year and they haven’t produced a product in ten years 😂\n\n“Moderna president, Dr. Stephen Hoge, said that “We will not sell it at cost.” Unfortunately, Moderna is in a difficult place here. For one thing, the NIH has staked a claim that it is a co-inventor of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine. Moderna has dismissed these claims saying that it is not aware of any intellectual property that prevents it from commercializing its vaccine. Couple this to the $483 million that the federal government has already given to Moderna for vaccine development, one can already hear the screams from Capitol Hill that U.S. citizens have paid for this vaccine and should get it not AT cost but BELOW cost. The fact that the top five Moderna executives have made more than $80 million this year with stock sales – while totally legal – will also be raised whenever Moderna makes the price of its vaccine public. \n\nFinally, there’s Wall Street. Moderna’s huge market cap is based on the equally high expectation that its Covid-19 vaccine will be a cash cow. Can Moderna both meet such an expectation while being competitive with Pfizer’s $19.50/dose? Perhaps the Moderna vaccine will be far better than not only Pfizer’s vaccine but all of the others that are being developed and thus be able to command a premium price. But that’s a very speculative bet. “\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlamattina/2020/07/22/will-moderna-match-competitors-covid-19-vaccine-prices/", "id": "hw78e2", "created_utc": 1595470046.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "The price for MRNA isn’t based on the vaccine being profitable.

{"title": "A tale of Tesla and Vale", "selftext": "On Tesla's (TSLA) Q2 earnings call yesterday, Elon Musk stated he would provide a large contract to a nickel provider who could efficiently provide it in high amounts.  Elon wants to bring Tesla forward with 'growth' over 'profits':\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-nickel-idUSKCN24O0RV\n\n--\n\nThere are currently ten nickel producers who provide 60% of the global nickel:\n\nhttps://www.thebalance.com/the-10-biggest-nickel-producers-2339731\n\n--\n\nOne of the largest providers of nickel, Norilsk Nickel (NILSY), of Russia, in this past May, blundered a huge diesel spill into the Arctic, with a cleanup cost and fines of an estimated $2 Billion; it carries the largest environmental fine in Russian history.  Norilsk Nickel again, approximately two weeks ago this July,  had another problem; approximately 45 tons of jet fuel leaked from a pipeline into a lake in the Arctic:\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-06/nornickel-arctic-spill-caused-2-billion-damage-russia-says\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-norilsk-nickel-involved-in-new-arctic-fuel-spill-11594648849\n\nThe complications of Norilsk Nickel's recent operations show they are not efficient, albeit a leading producer of nickel.\n\n--\n\nAnother leading producer of nickel is Vale (VALE), of Brazil.  Vale is not free from disasters, however, such as the 2015 Mariana Dam disaster and the more recent 2019 Brumadingo Dam incident.  Between both catastrophes, villages and homes were destroyed, waterways polluted, and hundreds of people were killed:\n\nhttps://webdoc.france24.com/brazil-dam-mining-disaster-mariana/\n\nhttps://api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/environment/2019/01/brazil-brumadinho-mine-tailings-dam-disaster-could-have-been-avoided-say-environmentalists\n\n--\n\nA third leader of nickel production, Jinchaun Group, of China, tops the Asian market.  But, with current US/China tensions, this is a less likely option:\n\nhttps://news.metal.com/newscontent/100016566/jinchuan-international-actively-develops-overseas-mining-business/\n\n--\n\nPreviously mentioned Vale has a subsidiary, Vale Canada, which, after a slow-down from COVID-19, should be back to full capacity by early August:\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/vale-to-restart-nickel-mine-in-canada-after-covid-19-pause-1.1452504\n\nFull capacity = Lots of Nickel\n\nVale Canada also will have upwards of 20 EVs operating across five of their mines.  Deployment of EVs under Vale Canada \"are part of Vale’s commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement, which includes goals of being carbon neutral by 2050 and achieving a 33 per cent reduction of emissions by 2030.\":\n\nhttps://electricautonomy.ca/2020/07/02/vale-canada-electric-vehicles-ontario-mining/\n\nWith Vale Canada, there is efficiency, care for the environment, and a timed schedule to be fully producing what they are capable of.  Yes, Elon Musk could choose any or multiple nickel producers, however based off the competition, Vale appears to be the logical choice at this time, in my humble, amateur, opinion.
