I present with you some DD.\n\nIf the above holds true, fund managers, large pension funds and ETF's will need to rebalance portfolios this coming quarter. If you look at the top holdings of SPY. We can see the following top stock holdiings:\n\n**Microsoft Corporation** 6.01%\n\n**Apple Inc.** 5.74%\n\n**Amazon.com, Inc.** 4.67%\n\n**Facebook, Inc. Class A**  2.21%\n\n**Alphabet Inc.

SPY holds 257 Billion. If this fund decides to move just .5% out of Microsoft they would be redistributing 1 billion amongst the lower tier stocks. Will they do this? why not? They do it regularly, the question is if enough funds and ETF's do it at once, will it boost some stock and suppress others?\n\nBack to microsoft. SPY had 81 million shares as of yesterday. What did they have last september? 84 million.  [https://www.ssga.com/library-content/products/fund-docs/etfs/us/ps/SPDR\\_500-TRUST\\_PROSPECTUS.pdf](https://www.ssga.com/library-content/products/fund-docs/etfs/us/ps/SPDR_500-TRUST_PROSPECTUS.pdf)\n\nSPY has actually REDUCED microsoft holdings over the last year. Would they boost top holdings right now having such a massive run? if your mandate is to have a diverse portfolio, I doubt it.\n\nThis trend in the SPY ETF reducing holdings over the last year is also true of Apple, and Facebook but not Amazon.\n\nComapnies I like with low weights barring that something crazy with the virus doesn't happen and JPow's printer doesn't get jammed:\n\nCalls on :KO, PFE, INTC,  MMM, RTX\n\nEDIT: A response with more details on my thoughts:  \n\nI like gettin’ insulted cause it pushes me to verify the data i am posting and dig deeper.

Yes.\n\n2009-2010, 2004-2006/07.\n\nMy implication from this post is that the likelihood that hedge funds, financial advisors, mutual funds, etc... will look for returns elsewhere given that the FAANG index has had a ridiculous run over the last 10 years. One main driver of the market of recent years has been FANNG+M, and earnings expansion as part of the equation. The distortion of returns with something like RSP, DJIA vs QQQ/XLK/SPY on a YTD basis is quite remarkable. If you take out the FANNG+M out of SPY, the return is closer to the DJIA YTD number.\n\nSome of the other WSB’s picked up on this “This is the least dumb post today so it gets no love of course. But I think you’re right. Value and international have underperformed growth. I think we will see rotation from growth to value. EM should also benefit if US continues to get rona fucked.”\n\nLooking on the surface the implications that SPY and other investors are too overweight Tech screams bubble in every aspect. Of course, with the Fed printing money, who's to say it will stop? If you have a 0% risk-free rate you get TINA and FOMO, which has been happening to an extreme. Maybe those still rise and these stocks could easily rise with them. But I think is more likely to happen is the large tech companies start to level off. As this happens i believe money managers will be looking to rotate their money elsewhere in other stocks that have value. This has happened many times in the past.\n\nThis chart on a percentage basis from 1999-2002. We can see plenty of instances where tech was high and Coca-Cola or RTX proceeded to outperform MSFT on a short term basis over the next quarter or couple quarters.
