I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 13th, 2020.\n\n# **Market heads into worst earnings season in 12 years amid worries virus is slowing recovery  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/10/market-heads-into-worst-earnings-season-in-12-years-amid-worries-virus-is-slowing-recovery.html)**\n*****\n> The worst earnings season in years is about to begin, and it’s possible the stock market could shrug off the sharp profit decline, as long as companies see some signs of a recovery ahead.\n*****\n> Earnings are expected to fall by 44%, the worst quarterly performance since the Great Recession when S&P 500 profits fell by 67% in the fourth quarter of 2008, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data. It is also expected to be the worst quarter of the pandemic crisis, revealing the extent of the earnings damage as the economy slumped more than 30%.\n*****\n> Major financials JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo are among the financial firms reporting. Pepsico starts off the week with its report Monday, and Johnson and Johnson, Abbott Labs and Netflix also report.\n*****\n> The financial sector is expected to see a more than 52% decline in profits, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n> “U.S. companies are about to give us a look into their worst quarter since the Great Financial Crisis,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest. “But since so many companies aren’t giving earnings forecasts, investors won’t make moves based on earnings alone. They’ll also be looking at trends since the quarter ended. Increasing coronavirus cases, management outlooks, and price performance could all have an outsized impact, and that could lead to outsized market moves.”\n*****\n> Stocks turned in a mixed performance in the past week, reacting at times to the rising risks to the economy as coronavirus cases continued to increase in some states. The Dow posted a weekly gain of 0.96% while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were up 1.76% and 4.01%, respectively.\n*****\n> In the week ahead, there are some important economic reports, including CPI inflation data Tuesday and retail sales Thursday. Last month, retail sales rose a surprise 17.7% but this month economists are watching closely to see if the reversal of some openings and the delays in other is impacting consumer spending.\n*****\n> But it’s the earnings that could be a litmus test for markets.\n*****\n> “I think it really comes down to earnings, not what the numbers are going to be. People don’t care about the numbers. They want to hear what the companies have to say,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Adivsory Group. “Tech companies are going to have the most important earnings. Companies like semiconductors, that go into automobiles, computers and cell phones. They’re the ones that have to say our outlook is great, and therefore our stocks deserve to be at all-time highs.”\n*****\n> Tech company earnings are only expected to fall by 8%. The worst sectors are expected to be energy, with a decline of 154%, followed by consumer discretionary, expected to be down by 114%, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/Ofauj2F.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/AKFxc9T.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/1eL31BE.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/FsCRy91y/econcal1.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qTpjhn0.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Fc0ZqZt.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Th1egdj.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ml5HLly.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/C50RZb0L/er1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/yYFhGGwb/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/wMYycqTT/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/XJCBCGWz/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Does a Weak First Six Months Mean Trouble?\n\n> The wild ride of 2020 continues, with the S&P 500 Index down 20% in the first quarter and up 20% in the second quarter. Much like dropping a 20 dollar bill and picking it up, this doesn’t mean you are 20 dollars wealthier. Down 20% and then up 20% actually comes out to a 4% drop for the first half of the year.\n\n> What does a negative first half of the year tell us? Turns out, gains could be hard to come by the second half of this year. “Although 2020 is like nothing we’ve seen before, the fact of the matter is a weak first half of the year could mean weaker than normal returns for the rest of the year,” according to LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> In fact, the S&P 500 had been higher in the first six months of the year a record nine consecutive years before being lower in 2020. Since 1950, there were 48 times when the first six months were higher and the rest of the year gained 77% of the time and added 5.8% on average those final six months. Compare that with when the first six months of the year were lower 21 times, the final six months were higher only 52% of the time and up only 1.2% on average.\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, a move higher is quite likely after strength in the first six months of the year, while very modest gains could be in the cards if those first six months underwhelm.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/7.9.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Earnings Season Lurks\n\n> After a relatively quiet week for economic data and practically no earnings reports to speak of, the Q2 earnings season will kick off next week. Normally, earnings season starts quietly with just a handful of reports outside of the major banks, but next week will be relatively busy with some major players on the calendar. Things start off slowly with Pepsi (PEP) on Monday. Tuesday, we’ll get reports from Citigroup (C), Delta (DAL), Fastenal (FAST), JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), all of whom are scheduled to report in the morning. Wednesday’s major reports include Goldman (GS), Progressive (PGR), and UnitedHealth (UNH) in the morning, while Alcoa (AA) will report in the afternoon. Thursday will be the busiest day of the week with too many stocks to list here, but Netflix (NFLX) will highlight the schedule of afternoon reports. Finally, Friday’s key reports include Blackrock (BLK) and State Street (STT).\n\n> As far as analyst sentiment stands heading into the current earnings season, while we wouldn't go so far as to say that it has made a full 180-degree turn from last quarter's negative extremes, it has been close. Over the last four weeks, analysts have raised forecasts for 580 companies in the S&P 1500 and lowered forecasts for 419. That works out to a net of 161 or just under 11% of the index. Besides the S&P 1500, six sectors have positive revisions spreads, while just two are negative. Sectors with the most positive revisions spreads include Consumer Staples, Energy, and Technology, while the two sectors with negative spreads are Financials and Real Estate. Financials just can’t find any love these days.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/sectors.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The \"Miracle\" Nasdaq 100\n\n> For anyone unfamiliar with the 1969 Miracle Mets, the \"Amazins\" were 10 games out of first place as late as mid-August and then went on to win 38 out of their last 49 games to finish in first place over the Cubs. From there, the Mets went on to win the first World Series in the history of the franchise in what at the time was one of the biggest turnarounds in the history of baseball. Ironically, in 2007, the Mets were on the other end of another historic turnaround after they blew a seven-game division lead with less than a month left in the season by losing 12 of their last 17 games. But that collapse is a story for another time.\n\n> Like the Miracle Mets in 1969, the Nasdaq 100 in 2020 has also staged a historic turnaround. After trading up over 10% earlier in the year, the gains quickly evaporated with the COVID outbreak. Within two months, the Nasdaq 100 went from a YTD gain of over 10% to a decline of over 20% by late March. From there, though, the Nasdaq has gone on an epic run, not only erasing all of its losses but also trading to record highs and a gain of over 20% on the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/2020.png))**\n\n> The frequency of positive days for the Nasdaq 100 provides another illustration of the index's strength this year. So far this year, the index has traded higher on 63% of all trading days. That may not sound like much, but if the year were to end today, it would be the highest percentage of positive days for a given year in the Nasdaq 100's history. On a side note, it's interesting to see in this chart how similar the percentage of positive days has been on a year to year basis over time. There has never been a year where fewer than 46% of all trading days have been positive, and prior to 2020, there has never been a year where more than 62% of all trading days were higher.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/Winning-Percentage-By-Year.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# China Charges Higher\n\n> We've highlighted the run in Chinese equities quite a lot in the last several days, but it keeps getting more and more extreme. With a gain of over 1% overnight, China's CSI 300 not only turned in its eighth straight day of gains but also its eighth straight day of rallying more than 0.5%. In the history of the CSI 300 dating back to 2002, there has only been one other time where the CSI 300 saw eight or more straight daily gains of 0.5%. That was back in April 2007.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/070920-CSI-300-Streaks.png))**\n\n> If you don't remember what was going on with Chinese equities back in April 2007, take a look at the chart below. The last time the CSI 300 had a streak of 8+ days of 0.5% daily gains, the CSI had already doubled in the prior six months. From there, though, it went on to nearly double again in the next six months. Eventually the bubble burst, and it wasn't much more than a year later that the CSI 300 was back below where it was in April 2007.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/070920-CSI-300.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gold Cup\n\n> The gold ETF (GLD) has gone through a nine-year drought from new all-time highs, but as it gets closer to its prior highs from September 2011, there are three possible upcoming technical set-ups. The first would be a massive multi-year \"cup and handle\" pattern. You can see the \"cup\" that has been forming over the last nine years. For the \"handle\" to form, GLD would need to go into a sideways consolidation phase from here for a bit. Once that consolidation phase occurs, the pattern would suggest a significant leg higher over potentially years (rather than months).\n\n> The second -- and more negative -- setup would be a bearish \"double top.\" This would happen if GLD gets right up to its highs from September 2011 and fails to break through that resistance\n\n> Finally, the third setup would simply be a breakout higher from here. GLD could simply continue moving higher and break right through resistance at its 2011 high.\n\n> Regardless of what happens, the \"cup\" that has been forming for nearly a decade now is something you don't see often. It will be interesting to watch this pattern from a technical perspective over the next few months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/07/gold.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending July 10th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=docVootdn1A)**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 7.12.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0ZTPZ5YD2g))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$JPM** \n> * **$PEP** \n> * **$NFLX** \n> * **$WFC** \n> * **$DAL** \n> * **$DPZ** \n> * **$C** \n> * **$BAC** \n> * **$UNH** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$FAST** \n> * **$GS** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$FRC** \n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$PNC** \n> * **$ASML** \n> * **$USB** \n> * **$BK** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$MS** \n> * **$ERIC** \n> * **$WIT** \n> * **$ALLY** \n> * **$SON** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$AA** \n> * **$SCHW** \n> * **$TFC**\n> * **$ANGO** \n> * **$CFG** \n> * **$BMI** \n> * **$HOMB** \n> * **$ALV** \n> * **$RF** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$SNBR** \n> * **$STT** \n> * **$KSU** \n> * **$JBHT** \n> * **$WNS** \n> * **$KRUS** \n> * **$AMRB** \n> * **$MRTN**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/C50RZb0L/er1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/qRytMj95/ervol1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 2 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/XH4RkL4.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 7.13.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Hnhgyk3j/er71320am.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 7.13.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uKFekV6.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 7.14.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/yYDBz0YR/er71420am.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 7.14.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/y6QB5LBB/er71420pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 7.15.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/fT1sW-kJr/er71520am.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 7.15.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/zGWry5hX/er71520pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 7.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/8CmgbHw2/er71620am.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 7.16.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/pdHt87QQ/er71620pm.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 7.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Y9Xc5C58/er71720am.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 7.17.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# JPMorgan Chase & Co. $96.27\n> **JPMorgan Chase & Co.

{"title": "XRX... inhale the crotch fumes", "selftext": "Well folks, let's scratch around in the bargain basement and see what we can find! What's this damp rag in the corner, covered in fleas? My oh my, it's Xerox, beloved purveyor of printing hardware & services!\n\nWhen the US market took a bazooka to the face on 23 March, this pail of garbage sank 55%. Unlike many of its peers in the mature \"tech\" sector, it didn't get a helping of that sweet V-Shaped Recovery Juice and is slightly down since then (a further 9%). For context, their competitor HP recovered 20% since March 23 (we'll get back to them later). \n\nSo why would you pick up this discarded boxer short and inhale its fumes?  \n\nFor starters, XRX is sitting on a $2.5bn cash pile, not bad for a $3.1bn company. Price to book is 0.58 and Enterprise value to EBITDA is 3.97 in a (once again) hot market. As a bundle of productive assets, it’s pretty cheap. \n\nImagine picking up some crumpled up trash and finding half a bag of still perfectly edible cheetos… that's the XRX dividend. After the most gruesome Q1 in a decade, did they wuss out and cancel their usual $.25 quarterly dividend? Hell no! They paid up like honorable Kazakh gamblers, and why wouldn’t they with those ample ca$h reserves? At current prices, the dividend yield is a very useful 6.84%. \n\nIn the sewers, it is not unheard of for a smaller, meaner rat to try and eat a larger, lazier rat. This is exactly what happened in the pre-Covid Before Times when Xerox tried to acquire HP Corporation, which competes in printing but also shills PC hardware. This attempt was greatly encouraged by Xerox & HP megashareholder Carl Icahn, but even so, they just couldn’t swallow the rat. This year, at this depressed valuation, there is every chance that someone might see Xerox itself as an attractive target and happily pay up for the privilege. \n\nSo that’s why I like the putrid whiff of Xerox: cheap assets, cheap dividend yield and takeover potential. Earnings were predictably bad in Q1 but could be worse, and while Xerox is vulnerable to the “work from home” phenomenon and further COVID-19 disruptions to the economy, I think they have been over-discounted in comparison to their peers. \n\nI’m backing up my truck to scoop up some of this slop. \n\nlinkz:\n\n* [Xerox Q1 Earnings](https://www.news.xerox.com/_gallery/get_file/?file_id=5ea78f462cfac224379da6d3&ir=1&file_ext=.pdf)\n* [XRX – The Last Corona Holdout (r/wallstreetbets)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gzref5/xrx_the_last_corona_holdout/)", "id": "homrji", "created_utc": 1594377937.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "I posted on xerox a month ago, bought October 25Cs, down 95%, holding strong, 💎💩🤲🏻", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Brother", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "No, Xerox", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Yeah I linked to your post in mine.

Trying to do DD before deciding long or short", "selftext": "\\[UPDATE 7/17/2020\\] It looks like I am correct in anticipating that $NFLX's subscriber's growth Q2 is not as strong as some of the reputable WS analysts thought. May and June are particularly much weaker than April, especially June in negative territory. \n\nHello! I am trying to decide whether to long or short on $NFLX, or do nothing.  All the metrics that I have personally reviewed regarding apps ranking on Apple and Android App stores show that $NFLX app has gained huge popularity in March-early April but has been way down since then, on a global scale. It is still higher than pre-COVID, to be sure. So, I do not know on what basis Goldman Sachs got so optimistic about the new subscriber numbers. I know that the GS analyst uses SensorTower, which I do not have access to. But even the SensorTower blog shows that Netflix downloads number has been way down since April. It made no.5 in April, but did not make top 10 in May, and barely made no.10 in June, basically back to February.

I am curious to know what resources you all use to gauge the popularity of Netflix (or similar companies).  Criticism is appreciated. I would love to know if I am doing anything wrong or stupid.
