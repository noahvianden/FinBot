{"title": "Boeing calls analysis - Would love a critique", "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nI've been investing for years, but never been much into options since school. Making some careful forays into options this summer, and would love to get your critique on this simple calculation to see where my thinking might be wrong. Summarized the claim is that call options on Boeing appear to be undervalued in the market given a simple valuation model.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA simple python implementation of Black Scholes seems to approximate the actual market values for option chains on indices (e.g. SPY), or options that seem to be frequently traded this summer (e.g. Tesla).\n\nSome assumptions:\n\n* Volatility is given by one-year volatility of stock\n* Only included contracts which expire in 29 days\n* Risk free rate is 0.48% (1yr LIBOR)\n\nSome example graphs comparing yesterdays options chain with calculated values per strike:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fystn21dbeb51.png?width=393&format=png&auto=webp&s=eec11d50d58cd891b654e1d90b22774d74281b3a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e5of0i3raeb51.png?width=397&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2cbbe21b10dbc0d9e9a76eee0785178a258c424\n\nSo, Boeing. Given the following assumptions, we do the same exercise on BA, and find that calls are largely valued lower in the market than by a Black Scholes calculation:\n\n* Time to maturity: 29 days\n* Annual dividend rate: 0.48% (1yr LIBOR)\n* Stock volatility: 134%\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xo7m46ziaeb51.png?width=398&format=png&auto=webp&s=666d1ec085e2cd64306f920d3a1059f758b442f8\n\nHow come the Scholes price exceeds the market price by a so large margin? In isolation, this should mean this is a good buy. That said, it appears that the market either assumes roughly half volatility of what is observed the last year, that there is a strong feeling in the market that this stock has a very strong negative trend, or that there is some error in my assumptions. Would love your thoughts!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nUpdated with reduced risk free rate to 1yr LIBOR, but observe that sensitivity to rf appears extremely low. Appears that the explanation here is that IV and historical vol is more or less the same for SPY, while they differ drastically for Boeing. However, given that Boeing is vastly more leveraged than one year ago, why does it make sense that IV is so much lower?", "id": "hs7r4l", "created_utc": 1594898088.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "You're using the wrong kind of volatility.
