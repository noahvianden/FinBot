Basically I'm pulling SPY historical end of day data since 1992 or something and VIX for the same period.\n\nI'm using both Black Scholes and Binomial Tree to calculate option prices however since I am not planning on paying CBOE $2,500.00 for historical option data just yet, I don't have the historical IV for SPY or any other ticker.\n\nQuestion is, could using historical VIX end of day prices as IV input to module SPY historical option prices net an accurate result? \n\nOr am I missing something when I assume i can use historical VIX price as IV input to model SPY options?", "id": "elfsyc", "created_utc": 1578423087.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": ">Question is, could using historical VIX end of day prices as IV input to module SPY historical option prices net an accurate result?  \n>  \n>Or am I missing something when I assume i can use historical VIX price as IV input to model SPY options?\n\nThe VIX is \"one number\". It represents a kind of \"average\" (or probably more accurately, a \"central tendency\", as it's a somewhat intricate calculation) of a set of slightly OTM puts and calls on a couple of relatively short term expiration cycles on SPX options.\n\nThe reason it's calculated like that is because ***different options have different IVs***. This is often referred to as the ***volatility smile***.\n\nIf you input \"the VIX\" into your model for all the options, you'll get something like *\"what the option price should have been, if its IV was equal to the VIX\"*. That's gonna give you ***very inaccurate and unreliable results***.\n\n*A potential solution, depending on what you are trying to do, is to* ***purchase historical data for a volatility surface model***, and then use that to calculate your historical prices. You can buy it for incredibly cheaper than the Cboe's $2.5k dataset. I have used some daily data I subscribed to on Quandl, they were decent. If you need minute level timeseries, I'm not sure where to find, though.\n\nHere are some links with a few options, depending on what you're trying to do:\n\n* [https://www.quandl.com/data/VOL](https://www.quandl.com/data/VOL)\n* [https://www.quandl.com/data/OPT](https://www.quandl.com/data/OPT)\n* [https://www.quandl.com/data/OWF](https://www.quandl.com/data/OWF)\n\n**Note**: seems like Quandl is having some non-sense going on, and is giving me a 403 Forbidden error on those links, if I try to open them while logged in, because I'm not a subscriber.

The end effect is that the VIX provides a vega-weighted summation of the IVs for all SPX options for that maturity.\n\nWhy don't you just calculate the historic (realized) volatility for the SPX as the input to your pricer?

Of course, looking backward you can calculate it, or get a crude estimate of what it will be from some hand-waving, but you never know ahead of time what the realized volatility will end up being.\n\nI had assumed the OP was interested in estimating what a given option should be priced given some _estimate_ of the current volatility. The reason training a model that has realized volatility as an input is a bit dubious because you never _know_ the instantaneous volatility. If you can divinely intuit what it is then yeah it's just plug and chug with whatever model is most appropriate.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "This is a pretty good question! I’m not sure I have a definite answer but I have a few thoughts.\n\n1-google CBOE VIX white paper and read about how the index is calculated. It’s been awhile but if I remember correctly it represents a 30 day forward volatility estimate annualized. I believe an option’s IV is the same but for the term of that specific option. So using the VIX to price an option 2 months out would be lead to inaccurate results.\n\n2-my guess is that it will not provide accurate values because if you do decide to use it, the VIX is just one value. If you are trying to price option chains (and compare to historical option values) at different strikes they are all going to have a different IV. Therefore, applying a single volatility estimate to price all options in the chain will not get you accurate results when comparing to the actual historical option prices. Essentially you will be using a flat volatility estimate when there should be a volatility smile/smirk. From the white paper, the VIX represents, “an interpolation between two points in the volatility structure”.\n\n3-sorta a blend of 1&2 but the VIX is calculated on a basket of options at different strikes and different time to expiration, but again boils down to a single number. You may be able to reverse engineer the VIX calculation to get those underlying option prices but I imagine that would be very difficult to do. \n\nAll of this means that you probably will not get accurate valuations compared to historic option prices. Vega, or an option’s sensitivity to changes in volatility, is highest or most sensitive at the money. If your IV estimate is incorrect it may not significantly impact deep in or out of the money options but your at the money options will have a larger error in the estimated price versus the historic actual price.\n\nJust some thought I had while eating lunch. You may be able to develop or use this as a reasonable method but it depends on how accurate you are looking to be. If your just looking for a back of the envelope style estimate, sure. If your developing and backtesting a trading strategy based on this method, probably not.\n\nFinal thought is give it a try. Try pricing a current option with the VIX and see how close you get to the traded price. Or you could just look at how different your VIX was from the IV shown in the current option chain.\n\nP.s. sorry for any formatting issues, I’m on my phone at lunch.

I'm trying to write something similar guys at TastyTrade did where they analysed certain things of OTM options and compared certain strategies e.g. short strangle vs iron condor in their Building Blocks series.   \nBasically backtesting certain strategies over long periods and seeing how they perform.\n\nPurely for fun, on a side, I'm also builing a simulated environment where a Q learning agent will be learning to trade options with certain goals in mind ( one of them possibly being \"return + PnL\" ) .

{"title": "Uber is working on a flying car with Hyundai", "selftext": "Uber Technologies Inc. is working on a flying car with Hyundai Motor Co., the first automaker to buy into Uber’s dream for a network of air taxis dotting the skies of major cities.\n\nThe two companies outlined their partnership Monday at the CES technology conference and plan to show off a full-scale model of the vehicle this week on the trade show floor in Las Vegas. Hyundai’s aerial taxi would be able to take off and land vertically, accommodate four passengers and cruise at up to 200 miles per hour. It would be fully electric with a range of 60 miles.\n\nThe concept is similar to those designed by Boeing Co. and a handful of other companies in collaboration with Uber Elevate, the ride-hailing company’s aerial division. In addition to sci-fi ventures, the group also oversees Uber helicopter rides, which are available in New York City. Uber has said it will conduct the first public demonstration of a flying car this year and allow customers to book aerial rides by 2023.\n\nIn more terrestrial pursuits, Uber said earlier Monday that it’ll start selling bus tickets through its app in Las Vegas, making it the second city to sign up for a public transit program the company introduced last year. Customers in the city will see public transit as one of the options in the Uber app, alongside car rides. They can then plan their route and purchase tickets for the same price they would pay using traditional methods. Riders will be able to use the tickets when their phone is offline. Uber expects to introduce the feature to additional cities around the world in the coming months.\n\nSelling bus tickets is the latest deviation from Uber’s core ride-hailing business, part of a larger strategy to encourage customers to open the app more frequently. The company sees increased usage as a way to drive people to other services, including delivery of meals or groceries, rentals of electric bicycles or scooters and someday, flying car rides.\n\nThe company’s transit partnership with Las Vegas is nearly identical to an arrangement it made last year with Denver, the first place where Uber offered public transit ticketing. While there are just two cities that support ticket sales through the app, Uber and its main U.S. competitor, Lyft Inc., both display public transit routes for many more places.\n\nDavid Reich, Uber’s head of transit, acknowledged that the feature may deal a blow to Uber’s main business among cost-conscious customers. He said the trade-off is worth it if people learn to use Uber more regularly and trust it to offer comprehensive transportation information. “Sometimes they’ll take something other than Uber, and that’s OK,” Reich said.\n\nLas Vegas will get a new transit option as soon as this year, courtesy of Elon Musk. A startup founded by the billionaire, called Boring Co., broke ground last year on a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center, where CES is held. Musk plans to pack riders into vehicles designed by Tesla Inc. zooming through the narrow tunnel. Reich said Uber is open to conversations with Musk but that there’s currently no plan in place to sell tickets for Boring Co.’s Loop transit system.\n\nFor the flying car project, Uber is working with NASA and a half-dozen manufacturers, including Textron Inc.’s Bell and Joby Aviation. The arrangement with Hyundai stands out because the automotive giant could produce air vehicles at “rates unseen” in the aerospace industry, said Eric Allison, the head of Uber Elevate. High volume would, in theory, decrease the price per trip and make an air taxi network financially viable, he said.\n\nUber said it’ll provide partners with airspace support services, connections to ground transportation and a large base of customers. The companies will collaborate on finding places for the vehicles to take off and land, with Uber likely leveraging existing relationships with real estate companies including Hillwood Properties and Signature Flight Support.\n\nWhile Uber has held talks with the Federal Aviation Administration, the effort is likely to face heavy scrutiny from the regulator over logistics for takeoff and landing, noise and safety concerns. Hyundai said its vehicle will require a human pilot initially and eventually operate autonomously. Neither Hyundai nor Uber provided a timeline for dispensing with human pilots.\n\nThe move represents a pop of innovation for Hyundai, which, like other car manufacturers, has been hit by changing consumer habits that favor access over ownership and a preference for vehicles not powered by gasoline. For Uber, the arrangement expedites ongoing efforts to evolve from a ride-hailing company to a de facto global transportation and logistics provider. It may also offer a welcome distraction from Uber’s stock price, which has slipped about 30% since its disappointing initial public offering last year.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-06/uber-bus-tickets-are-coming-to-las-vegas?srnd=technology-vp](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-06/uber-bus-tickets-are-coming-to-las-vegas?srnd=technology-vp)", "id": "elhp1y", "created_utc": 1578430955.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "holy shit. you mean planes you dumb bitch? if you think the 737max had a lot of crashes imagine how many will be caused by all these unemployable rapist they put in these. fuck this circus stock.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe they can only go like 10 feet off the ground, who knows?
