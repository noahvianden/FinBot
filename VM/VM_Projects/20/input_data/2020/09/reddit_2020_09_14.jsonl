If people have patience and by patience, holding a good tech stock for 5-10 years, even 2-3 years, good chance they will have gains based on the fact the majority of these companies are only going to grow, split, and grow some more. Google, Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Nvidia, AMD, Amazon, Netflix as a few examples.\n\nDoing proper research there’s definitely smaller cap companies that will be benefiting as well on the tech front, just more risky picking the right one and well that’s part of the market, it’s all a gamble to a degree, but less so with many of the companies you mentioned that have an international presence and large market cap.\n\nAdvice to new peeps, diversifying is important like you said, a few mutual funds, ETF’s and REITS will go a long way. 70% safe and boring and 30% medium to high risk has worked well for me, granted when you see a company like Tesla, almost a no brainer that they will be here for a longtime coming. ie. A company disrupting multiple trillion dollar industries, a good sign of what’s to come. Risky but amazing upside. \n\nHigh risk does mean high rewards and also big dips, but overall patience patience patience and keeping up to date on company news will go a long way.

The S&P 500's earnings recovery is \"ahead of expectation\" because of policy support from the Federal Reserve, reopenings around the world, and long-term tech plays, the team wrote in a Friday note.\n\nThe latter is particularly important to the index's rebound. Though tech stocks are hot off a multiday decline, the companies are still showing relative insulation from the coronavirus pandemic's economic impact. Tech profits in the second quarter \"helped offset broader earnings weakness,\" the bank said, and that trend is likely to continue while other firms play catch-up.\n\n\"As for COVID-19 sensitive companies, 2Q likely marked the bottom with earnings to see a sustained recovery as the economy rebounds, and consumer and corporate behavior gradually normalize,\" the strategists wrote.\n\nThe recent pullback in stock prices is \"healthy\" and was mostly fueled by technicals including momentum gauges and systematic selling, the team added.\n\nThe recovery from second-quarter lockdowns is also driving a faster-than-usual rebound in various market indicators, according to the bank. JPMorgan's US Quant Macro Index — a composite of growth, sentiment, liquidity, and inflation gauges — is in the middle of a sharp V-shaped bounce. The US manufacturing industry, while \"not booming,\" has stabilized in a steady growth phase, JPMorgan said.\n\nLeading indicators, including freight-car loadings and private-housing permits, continue to trend higher and hint at economic gains to come, the team added.\n\nThe strengthening gauges should give way to similarly robust profit growth. JPMorgan expects S&P 500 firms' margins to recover from the pandemic's hit by the second half of 2021 as demand rebounds and interest costs fall. The team said the index's earnings per share would hit $136 by the end of the year and $170 in 2021, higher than the consensus estimates of $130.19 and $166.39.\n\nThe US presidential election presents the biggest risk to the firm's forecast; each administration would come with policy uncertainties that could drag on investor sentiments. The lack of another stimulus bill to bridge the coronavirus slump could also stifle a market rally, the strategists said.\n\nThe S&P 500 sat at 3,393.92 as of 12:50 p.m. ET, up 5% year-to-date.\n\n[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-sp500-rise-profit-growth-fundamentals-recovery-jpmorgan-2020-9-1029587185#](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-sp500-rise-profit-growth-fundamentals-recovery-jpmorgan-2020-9-1029587185#)", "id": "isubtz", "created_utc": 1600118113.0, "score": 60, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 64, "replies": [{"body": "Round 3.", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Stocks only go up", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Stonks*", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It looks more likely that there won’t be another stimulus bill, or am I wrong?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "And american citizens will get nothing out of whatever stimulus bill they come up with.", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "Is it really that low?
