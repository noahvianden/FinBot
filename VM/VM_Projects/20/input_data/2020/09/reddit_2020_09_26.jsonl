{"title": "I truly think the stock market will go down more even though I am perma-bull", "selftext": "This article could not have been illustrated better about the current market situation. It's so good that I have to share it here and ask you guys what you think. It's extremely bearish and I truly believe the worst is yet to come, both for stock market and economy. I understand stock market kinda behaves independently of economy somehow, ever since March low.\n\nInsanely high all time highs, based on nothing besides a stimulus and a promise to print more, pandemic, unprecedented uncertainty, continued job losses, PPP expiring in Oct which means more bankruptcies and layoffs, Covid-case spike in part of Europe and US, SCOTUS vacancy, election year, all on the back of an insane 10 year run.\n\nLiterally no GOOD reason to be bullish right now.\n\nBelow was the article I read. What do y'all think?\n\n(Sorry I cannot quote the source bc it looks like youtube link is banned from this subreddit)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy the stock market will go down much more once this Fed/election rally ends:\n\n1. 330 Trillion dollars of very poor credit market debt that needs to be deleveraged and the Fed's 1 Trillion farts can't do anything to stop this.Japan has been doing for 30 years what the Fed is trying to do now. Guess what: it won't work when the world has 330 Trillion dollars to deleverage by at least 50%. We're in a deflationary trap and spiral.\n2. Corporate share buyback Ponzi model has come to an end as public pension funds (states, municipalities, cities, etc.) have no tax revenues presently to buy corporate bond issuances to fund corporations who use that very money to buy and drive up their own stock to stuff management's pockets with bonuses.\n3. 90 cents of every dollar S&P 500 companies earned in the last 5 years also went towards corporate buybacks combined with an unprecedented issuance of corporate debt and equity dilution helping this endless Ponzi scheme.\n4. Economy for over a decade barely growing at 1% average despite all the above Endless rounds of QE for 12 years now, interest rates pushed to zero punishing savers and tax cuts that were really not necessary.\n5. Consumer debt to income ratio at unsustainable all time high levels (175 debt to income ratio and climbing higher as well as 12 times debt to savings ratio and climbing higher) with real unemployment (unemployed, underemployed and not counted in workforce) at 50% plus and the remaining workforce seeing their hours and salaries cut.\n6. All stock market indicators at all time high levels. P/E over 30, Price to Sales Ratio over 2.5, Enterprise Value to EBITDA over 25, Buffet Indicator (Market Cap / GDP) over 135%, Shiller P/E over 27, Q factor (the market value divided by its assets' replacement cost) at 1.76.\n7. Bond market has been screaming major recession/depression and deflation for almost a year with yield curve inverting three times and the 30-year T trading almost at 1% (totally crazy).\n8. M3 essentially at zero with consumer (70% of economy traditionally and 90% in 2019) tapped out on debt and 50% unemployed/underemployed.\n9. Corporations (30% of economy) already in recession since the start of\n10. The corporate bond/debt market in the mother of all bubbles with 90% of bonds trading at one notch above junk status.\n11. The IMF has stated that this year, the global economy will experience the worst recession since the great depression. It has also stated that for the first time since the great depression, both advanced economies and emerging markets are in recession with growth in advanced economies at -6.1% with income per capita projected to shrink for over 170 countries.\n12. Debt to GDP of all developed countries in the 150-300% range...who would have thought.\n13. The stock markets now are comprised of 5 companies representing 25% of the S&P and 40% of the Nasdaq. These percentages are beyond alarming and this never ends well.\n14. Healthy stock markets don't go down 35% and swing back up 30% in a matter of a month. This type of volatility always signals lower prices ahead. We're in fact in horrible company...this is the fastest 35% downward move in the stock market. And only two other times the stock markets have gone up 30% this fast: the first leg up of the Great Depression and the first leg up of the Great Recession. We all know what happened afterwards...lower lows over the next year to two years.\n15. Bear markets last on average 15 months.\n16. Retired baby boomers pulling money out of the stock market like notomorrow, while millennials have no money to invest.\n17. For those who are screaming inflation, they are dead wrong. Go study history and study it well: inflation only happens when demand overwhelmingly exceeds supply (which is not even remotely the case, it's actually the total opposite i.e. there is so much supply of everything, we don't even know what to do with it) or when a country prints money over money to serve its debt and has to keep doing that as they can't print fast enough. We have none of those presently as it relates to the USA or the US$.\n\nWe are a two tiered system comprised of crony capitalism combined with theworst part of socialism. Large corporations are benefiting during the good times and during the bad times when these same companies who should be going bankrupt or getting bought pennies on the dollar by more responsible corporations or getting merged with competitors are getting selectively bailed out by the Federal Reserve who is picking the winners and losers by their size and too big to fail criteria. Crony capitalism on the way up, socialism on the way down. This my friends is a broken corrupt system.\n\nThe stock markets are now trading in swings like penny stocks with all freemarket price discovery destroyed and not an ounce of sound monetary policy left. You have a bunch of douchebag academics (who think they know best) not only fighting mother nature but also fighting the principles of economics where boom and bust cycles need to be normal occurrences left to their owndevices for productivity to improve over time. But the Federal Reservedoesn't give a hoot about the principle of economics and they have becomethe real virus infecting the world because they have us play the game with one set of rules yet those rules are constantly broken by them to be the buyer/lender and owner of last resort and implement their grand scheme of becoming the world's central bank and having the entire world as their slaved. If common folks had this behavior, they would end up in jail. And this is a virus we won't be able to get rid of. Who wants to invest in a rigged market where prices are not based one bit on sound economics like reasonable P/E ratios, earnings, free cashflow growth and dividends where earnings are cratering.\n\nThe very timely Coronavirus is the medium that is exposing the fragility of this corrupt, selfish, self-centered astronomically over indebted overleveraged system.", "id": "izzjqy", "created_utc": 1601095616.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "> Literally no GOOD reason to be bullish right now.\n\nThis couldn't be further from the truth.

{"title": "$SNE - Sony Corporation", "selftext": "Sony Corporation is a Japanese multinational conglomerate that specializes in household durables and electronics, video game consoles and publications, records and comprehensive media, and a financial segment. It is traded publicly on the NYSE:SNE and the TYO:6758 and is listed on the Nikkei 225. In this post I will be translating all financial numbers to USD, as it is a Japanese company.\n\n**Company Overview**\n\nSony was founded as Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo, Ltd. in 1946, in Tokyo, Japan by Masaru Ibuka. They later changed its name to Sony in 1958 in order to \"romanize\" their brand. Sony is currently ran by Kenichiro Yoshida, CEO, who has been with the company since 1983 and worked his way up to CEO in 2018. The company is headquarted in Sony City, Minato, Tokyo, Japan and currently employs 111,700 people worldwide.\n\nSony is a diverse company that has several major segments. \n\n* Mobile Communications: Sony Mobile produces smartphones, tablets and applications. Sony Mobile holds under 1% of the global smartphone market, 4% of the European smartphone market and 17% of the Japanese market. So-Net is the other branch of this segment and provides internet services to its smartphone users.\n\n* Game & Network Services: this branch produces the PlayStation console as well as gaming related services such as PSN and the game publication studios. This is the largest branch of the conglomerate, making up about a quarter of total sales for the company.\n\n* Image Products & Solutions: this branch produces consumer and professional cameras and lenses\n\n* Home Entertainment: this covers televisions, blu-ray players, headphones and portable audio devices\n\n* Sony Pictures: all movies and television services owned by Sony, including Columbia Pictures, Sony Pictures and TriStar Studios. They also own several television programs in Japan and India.\n\n* Semiconductors: CMOS image sensors, CCDs, system LSIs, and other semiconductors, as well as batteries and storage systems.\n\n* Music: Sony/ATV Music and SME\n\n*Financial Services: Sony operates Sony Life Insurance, Sony Bank and Sony LifeCare. This segment makes up 15% of the company's income. \n\n**Basic Facts**\n\nStatistic | SNE\n---|---\nShare Price | $77.26\nMarket Cap | $95.6b\nP/E | 15.31\nPEG | 2.1\nP/S | 1.21\nROE | 16%\nDebt/eq | 0.38\nRevenue | $8.3b\nGross Profit | $2.2b\n\n**Dividends**\n\nStatistic | SNE\n---|---\nAnnual Dividend | $0.41\nDividend Yield | 0.53%\nPayout Ratio | 8.38%\n\nSNE pays a semi-annual dividend paid in Q1 and Q3. SNE has been steadily increasing its dividend since 2015 after stagnation and decline from 2006-2015.\n\n**Performance History**\n\nStatistic | SNE\n---|---\n1m | -4.76%\nSince March 23 | 46.05%\n52w | 30.05%\n5y | 208%\n10y | 168%\n\nA $10,000 investment in SNE 10 years ago would be worth $25,038.65 today.\t\n\n**Going Forward**\n\nToday, Sony Corporation is most known for the PlayStation. The PS5 is scheduled to be released later this year, which some say is priced in to the stock already. However, if the PS5 is a huge hit over the course of its generation's lifetime (until the PS6 is released), Sony will undoubtedly see a boost in revenue in income over the 5-10 year period. The PS5 is already expected to sell 5m units in 2020, while the Xbox Series X/S is expected 4m. For some comparison, the PS4 has sold 106m units in the lifetime of the console, and the Xbox One has sold 50m. \n\nHowever, past and expected sales don't mean a whole lot when Microsoft has been rapidly expanding their gaming department. Microsoft has been developing the Game Pass for a few years now and it is a huge success so far, some accredit it as the \"Netflix of Gaming\". Microsoft also recently acquired Bethesda, the studio responsible for hit game series Elder Scrolls and Fallout (even though we all know Obsidian makes the real Fallouts) (New Vegas for life). As Microsoft already owns Windows and therefore own most PC gamers, Sony will have to innovate rapidly to compete with Microsoft in the future. Game Pass is currently available for Xbox and PC gamers. Microsoft only has a small portion of its business in the gaming industry, while Sony hinges 25% of its business in the department, yet Microsoft is setting themselves up massively to steal Sony market share in coming years. Sony has PS Now, their version of Game Pass, however MSFT will own the \"Netflix of gaming\" department, until Sony comes up with their own version of Windows (lol). I have no doubt the PS5 will be a massive hit and be more popular than the Xbox (even as an Xbox gamer myself) but Sony is in danger of losing share to MSFT, especially as more gamers make the switch to PC. \n\nSony is the world's largest producer of the CMOS image sensor that is used in cameras, tablets and smartphones. I don't know much about semiconductors or the industry so I'm not going to pretend that I do for the post.\n\nSony Pictures is a massive media company, as they own several movie studios such as Columbia and TriStar. Cobra Kai was a recent success from them, and they own several franchises such as Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune.  \n\nSony Music Entertainment (SME) is one of the \"big three\" of the global record companies and is currently the second biggest music group in the world. \n\nTheir financial services are extremely profitable. Sony Bank, Sony Life Assurance and Sony Life. Their low expense fees make them a popular choice in Japan. Sony Bank is an online bank that operates no physical branches or ATMs. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSNE is trading at a very sound valuation right now, its low ratios + the hype surrounding the PS5 make it an attractive stock compared to the rest of the technology industry, as well as some international exposure to a portfolio. Analyst targets (I know, I know) forecast the stock to reach prices around $100 within a year, but that is very dependent on the success of the PS5. If it's a major hit and blows expectations out of the water, that number could very well be higher.\n\nThank you for reading and I hope to continue this series in the future. I plan on doing regular posts for stocks that aren't talked about alot on this sub, and if anyone has any criticisms or recommendations for future posts, I am more than happy to read them. \n\nPrevious Posts \n\n[$UNH](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ixisw9/unh_unitedhealth_group_inc/)", "id": "j04dt9", "created_utc": 1601119471.0, "score": 40, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "Sony is the largest employer in my city!", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "rancho bernardo?", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Nice.

Their games seem to get huge and broad appeal, whereas Microsoft's seem like a more narrow niche targeted at a stereotype.  \n\nThat said, Sony also dabbles with proprietary things all the time, from their own connectors to their own formats and so on, sometimes trapping consumers in some kind of expensive dead end. \n\nI've also noticed some possible signs of corporate evil/incompetence.   \n\nIn one recent instance, was helping diagnose a friend's alleged network problem.  Most of their devices had malfunctions.  I noticed it was all their Sony ones, not others, and, eventually, that it wasn't the network.  Turns out they had left a mildly negative review on a Sony website, and been secretly IP banned across all Sony services.  That meant smart tv wouldn't work, firmware checks, even the on screen help manuals were all broken, and just because of severe corporate insecurity.  \n\nMost recently, Sony has been pretty shady in hiding timeline and production issues with their console.  Again, that's not the conduct of a strong and confident company.  \n\nPersonally, and even as MSFT holder, I hope Sony's PlayStation continues to keep Xbox in check, but I do worry they've lost their edge, and might have the kind of weak and scared management that won't help.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "What is the expected revenue from OS5?

He expects tech to remain a favorite after the shakeout, and the market tone could change in October if earnings results are good and company outlooks are positive.\n*****\n> “I think that tends to turn things around,” he said.\n*****\n> Economists expect the much anticipated September employment report, the last before the election, to show a slower pace of job growth than in August. The consensus forecast is for 920,000 nonfarm payrolls, from 1.37 million in August, according to Refinitiv.\n*****\n> The unemployment rate is expected to drop to 8.2% from 8.4%. JP Morgan economists said they expect job growth to continue, but they also said the lack of stimulus and aid to the unemployed could slow consumer spending. They reduced their forecast for fourth quarter GDP growth to 2.5% from 3.5% Thursday.\n*****\n> # Election watch\nMichael Schumacher, director of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said the debate may have more potential to move the market than the jobs report. “Most people talk about these things and get all fired up and nothing happens, but this is such a weird year... This seems like the first big shot to see these guy in action. We think it’s a big event,” he said.\n*****\n> Schumacher said if Trump is perceived to win, and his chances rise in prediction markets by several points, there could be a positive move in risk markets and the bond market could sell off, sending yields higher. Trump is perceived as better for stocks and the economy, and Biden is expected to push for higher taxes and more regulation, he said.\n*****\n> “We think that pushes the 10-year yield up to 75 or 80 basis points,” he said. The 10-year has been locked in a range below 0.70% and was at 0.65% Friday.\n*****\n> “If Biden wins, then the debate is risk off. Then Trump’s chances of winning probably go to 40%, maybe lower. Then the 10-year yield goes to 0.60%,” he said.\n*****\n> The market was also expected to be volatile in the coming week because of month-end and quarter-end rebalancing, but Schumacher said the stock market sell-off has taken some of the pressure off of the need to realign portfolios and he expects about $9 billion to move into bonds for rebalancing.\n*****\n> Before the earnings period starts in the second week of October, the market is likely to continue to focus on what’s worrying it.\n*****\n> “What we have... is a lot of uncertainty related to the election, a lot of uncertainty related to stimulus,” said Townswick. He does not expect the political back and forth over the appointment of a new Supreme Court justice, following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to impact the markets.\n*****\n> “But the stimulus and election, people can say that’s going to directly relate to earnings,” he said. Townswick said the sell-off so far is not unusual for September, historically the worst month of the year.\n*****\n> Among S&P 500 companies, Townswick said 70% left their forecasts unchanged or revised them higher after second quarter earnings reports, while 30% reduced them. “If third quarter earnings come in relatively strong, then we could see more revisions upward and that would tend to support the market,” he said.\n*****\n> Many strategists expect the S&P 500 could decline all the way to its 200-day moving average which was 3,107 on Friday. The 200-day is a widely watched momentum indicator, based on the average of the closing prices in the last 200 sessions. If the index falls below it and stays there, it’s viewed as negative for the market but it often acts as support.\n*****\n> “I don’t have a target, but I think if that does happen, I would say that is a normal pullback and I wouldn’t expect it to break through and tank. I would say that might be supportive,” Townswick said.\n*****\n> The coming week is busy in terms of economic data. Besides the jobs report, there is ISM and PMI manufacturing data Thursday. Personal income and spending data is also released Thursday.\n*****\n> But it is the employment data, the market is watching most closely.\n*****\n> Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, said the weekly jobless claims data is sending a positive signal for the jobs report, but not all data matches it. The number of unemployed who have come off of state and special pandemic benefits totaled 2 million over the period between mid August and mid September, when the government collected data for Friday’s jobs report.\n*****\n> Tilley said he will not be so much focused on the non farm payrolls as on the number of people who say their job loss is now permanent. That number rose by 534,000 last month, to a total of 3. million. It was at 1.2 million in February\n*****\n> Initially when job losses mounted, many individuals expected their job loss was temporary.\n*****\n> “The permanent job loss is an indication of an amount of permanent scarring that’s going on in the economy,” he said. “The permanent job loss as a share of unemployment has been more rapid than the previous recessions.”\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/wb4gd2A.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N9GB7pr.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/F7N4lcy.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/9XvRbwLZ/econcal4.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/vxohRfN.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/uFKJWI5.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Og1iuMy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9A4Jc0z.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/jSVd4Ysc/ercal1.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/zBTB51gf/ipos1.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/h4rD0s8N/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/zXGJ2h0v/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/sxw3DfD3/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # September Bears Strike Again\n\n> The September weakness continued with the S&P 500 Index 9.6% off the all-time high set on September 2 (as of 9/23/20). It is important to remember that after a 60% rally in the S&P 500—and much more in some of the large cap tech stocks—this type of seasonal weakness is normal and expected. We noted in our blog Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year that some type of seasonal weakness could be in the cards.\n\n> Speaking of seasonal weakness, the second half of September historically has been one of the worst periods of the year for stocks, as shown in our chart below.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Another angle on this is showing how each day of the year does. Again, we are in the sweet spot for potential rocky seas.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> “To see some late-September weakness after a record 60% rally shouldn’t be too surprising,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “What might surprise some investors, though, is that after some of the previous best six-month rallies ever, in a lot of cases, the strength continued going out a year.”\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the recent rally was one of the best six-month rallies ever for the S&P 500. Looking at all the previous rallies that gained at least 30%, returns are somewhat muted near term. But going out a full year, prices have typically moved higher, up seven out of eight times a year later.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.25.20-blog-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # S&P 500 October Gains Frequently Precede Presidential Incumbent Party Victories\n\n> An interesting aspect of election-year Octobers is the propensity for S&P 500 gains when the incumbent party ultimately retains the White House. Of the ten incumbent victories since 1944, the S&P 500 has advanced seven times, declined twice, and was unchanged in 1944 with an average October gain of 1.4%. Of the nine occurrences since 1944 when the incumbent was defeated, there were six S&P 500 declines and three advances in October. The average October decline when incumbents were defeated was 2.1%. Even excluding the S&P’s 16.9% plunge in 2008, incumbent defeats were still preceded by an average October loss of 0.3%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/cbcf92c83edf8fa419f858f97753f5b3/fc62a1e0362941f1-92/s400x600/14f363a1beca3d2f879a2228394f91ff339b2a37.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # \"Low Energy\" Energy\n\n> US stocks are looking to close out the week on a positive note with the S&P 500 up over 1%. One sector that hasn't been participating in the rally, however, is Energy. While it just moved back into positive territory for the day, the sector remains at the back of the pack in terms of sector performance. If these levels hold for the remainder of the trading day, it will be the 69th time in the last 200 trading days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector. That works out to more than once every three trading days. Talk about a sector that's in liquidation mode!\n\n> The chart below shows the rolling 200-day total number of days that Energy has been the worst-performing sector in the S&P 500. While the current level of 69 is extremely high, earlier this month the rolling 200-day total was even higher at 71. Over this same period of time, no other sector has even seen close to as many days of ranking at the bottom as Energy. The next closest is Utilities as it has been at the bottom of the pack in terms of performance on 36 of the last 200 trading days. It hasn't just been the last 200 trading days that have been rough for the Energy sector. Over the last five years, the sector has been the worst-performing sector on just over 23% of all trading days. Is this what it felt like for the horse and buggy companies in the early 1900s or the ice-harvesting companies after the invention of electric refrigeration?\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/092520-Energy.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Election Anxiety Weighs on October Market Performance\n\n> October often evokes fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of crashes in 1929, 1987, the 554-point drop on October 27, 1997, back-to-back massacres in 1978 and 1979, Friday the 13th in 1989 and the 733-point drop on October 15, 2008. During the week ending October 10, 2008, Dow lost 1,874.19 points (18.2%), the worst weekly decline in our database going back to 1901, in percentage terms. March 2020 now holds the dubious honor of producing the worst, second and third worst DJIA weekly point declines. The term “Octoberphobia” has been used to describe the phenomenon of major market drops occurring during the month. Market calamities can become a self-fulfilling prophecy, so stay on the lookout and don’t get whipsawed if it happens.\n\n> But October has become a turnaround month—a “bear killer” if you will. Twelve post-WWII bear markets have ended in October: 1946, 1957, 1960, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1987, 1990, 1998, 2001, 2002 and 2011 (S&P 500 declined 19.4%). However, eight were midterm bottoms. Over the last 21 years, October’s performance has been solid. Average gains over the last 21-years range from 1.3% by Russell 1000 to 2.4% by NASDAQ. Small caps have still struggled though with Russell 2000 gaining a modest 0.5%\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/aba6ebb2f208cb4b7a30b5ef83275d92/74b7a456a8bd8bcd-fc/s400x600/fb3400cc8b8054a896bd8e031be58ee2872d9e24.jpg))**\n\n> Election-year Octobers rank dead last for Dow, S&P 500 (since 1952), NASDAQ (since 1972), Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 (since 1980). Eliminating gruesome 2008 from the calculation provides a moderate amount of relief, as rankings climb to mid pack. Should a meaningful decline materialize in October it is likely to be an excellent buying opportunity, especially for any depressed technology and small-cap shares.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5 Real-Time Data Charts To Track the Recovery\n\n> We check in again today on some of the real-time economic data that LPL Research is monitoring to provide timely and valuable insights into the state of the US economy. Traditional economic data is often reported too slowly to pick up the changes that are occurring in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n> The latest data on US COVID-19 cases has shown steady progress since peaking at the end of July. COVID-19 hospitalizations are at the lowest levels since the end of June and are close to the lows of mid-June. The number of positive COVID cases rose over the last week, and while the number of tests performed increased, the positive test rate also increased to near 6% (source: COVID Tracking Project). Further, Labor Day get-togethers may have created the recent bump in transmission, a trend we saw following other holidays over the summer.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> “Even as much of the real-time data shows a slowing recovery as Americans adjust to the new normal, it’s encouraging that new COVID-19 cases and hospitalization rates have improved greatly since mid-summer,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Progress on a COVID-19 vaccine and fiscal stimulus could help the economy and markets in the fourth quarter, but as investors struggle with election uncertainty and US-China tensions remain elevated, it’s likely to be a bumpy ride.”\n\n> Out of all the indicators we monitor, US retail sales had been showing one of the most robust recoveries toward the end of the summer as it exceeded 2019 levels on a year-over-year basis, but the most recent weekly readings from retailers on same-store sales recently slipped back lower than last year (source: Bloomberg, Johnson Redbook). It’s not surprising that consumer confidence levels, as measured by the Bloomberg Weekly Consumer Comfort Index, also dipped on their last reading.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Driving map routing requests by the Apple maps app exceeded pre-pandemic levels but have since leveled off and is now declining slightly. This real-time indicator steadily recovered from March and April lows as people returned to work or other economic activity, and it’s been continuing at a higher than normal rate as Americans travel by car when they previously may have used public transit or air travel. Public transit usage, as measured by Moovit, is still at only 50% of its baseline level, as working from home has a huge effect on usage numbers in major metropolitan areas.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-6.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Electricity demand is also showing a bumpy recovery. It had recovered, dipped, and then recovered, only to dip again since the start of September. Demand for electricity dropping again potentially indicates a slowdown in the rate at which businesses are reopening or softening demand for their goods and services.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> During the midst of the March lockdowns, the number of diners in US restaurants hit extreme lows of -100% compared to the same time last year. The last reading on this indicator was -45%, coming off a recent peak of -30% on September 7 (source: Opentable). Restaurant bookings could be under pressure as cooler weather makes outdoor dining less comfortable in parts of the country.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.21.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> As the seasons change from summer to fall, consumer behavior often changes, too, and the potential for heightened rates of viral transmission grows. We will continue to monitor key high-frequency data and provide updates for clues about the path of the economic recovery as we continue to battle the outbreak of COVID-19 across the globe.\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/jSVd4Ysc/ercal1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/9QGXxg0h/ervol1.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 9.28.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/hryCCMm.pngg))\n\n> # ***Monday 9.28.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ymR5Z5V.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  9.29.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ER6w385.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 9.29.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/p2YCpFn.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.30.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/b7i1AYQ.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 9.30.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1N7dKUo.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.1.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XL4b2EY.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 10.1.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.2.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 10.2.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # Micron Technology, Inc. $49.14\n**Micron Technology, Inc.

Is that correct?\n\nI'm not sure. If it stays flat - that means, you'll collect all your calls premiums. You can, of course, sell them way too OTM, and/or with low IV, so they won't cover the LEAP's price. How likely is that - I don't know and likely that depends. One of the things to consider is to buy the LEAP cheaper, when the IV is low and the underlyings' price is low. Probably the IV calculation for LEAPs is different from that for weeklies, yet the IV for LEAPS changes too, so you can buy it cheaper. Note, that that way your LEAP will get value (that you can realize), even if it stays flat, disregarding even selling the calls.\n\n> With a poor man's covered call that gets assigned, isn't the long call I own sold anyway?\n\nYes, but see tons of posts here - usually it is way safer to close your legs manually just before expiration. If you don't have the funds and the margin - I think your LEAP will be exercised. But if not (say, your margin increased suddenly) or if I am wrong - you can be fucked greatly.\n\n> is your point if you just close out the close call you sold at a loss, then you can sell calls again?\n\nThe whole point is to look at the prices. To illustrate: suppose you're getting assigned on a weekly, but have a half year LEAP ITM to cover. Let's say you have QQQ LEAP with strike at 250, the call's strike is 290, the QQQ is at 295 and you sold your call for $1 and you're close to expiration. Your call's price is like $5, as it is near expiration, so it is just 295 - 290. But what is your LEAP price? It is at least 295 - 250 = $45. In fact, it still has half a year of theta packed in it, so it will cost way more, probably no less than $55. And it is just stupid to lose $55 of value to cover $4 loss. The upside here is that likely QQQ mooned to get your call ITM (i.e. it was at some 275, so the LEAP price increase is some 290-275=$15, minus maybe week's theta decay, but even that may be covered, cause IV increased because of that jump). So your LEAP price rose way more, than your $4 loss.  \nUPD, on exercise, the intrinsic value will not be lost, i.e. you'll receive your shares for $250 and sell them for $290, but all the 'theta' value will be lost.\n\nIt is up to you, what you'll do. Maybe indeed just write off that $4 loss. Hey, you've got a net profit! Think of it like you've lost $4 of the QQQ's price increase, because you've hedged against QQQ being not so bullish, and continue selling calls (wait till it stops to moon and sell call at some top). If you think that is some kind of spike and QQQ will fall later and unlikely to recover - sell your LEAP for the profit.
