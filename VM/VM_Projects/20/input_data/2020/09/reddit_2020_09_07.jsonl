After CRWD having great earnings and raising outlook (unless I’m mistaken) there’s really no sense in trying to bet on direction now. Thoughts?", "id": "io10qg", "created_utc": 1599453557.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "I play strangles on earnings extensively and have for more than a decade and. although challenging to set up (you have to be very selective), they can be very profitable.\n\nMuch of the discussion that I see on this sub about strangles seems to come from people who don't trade them. Because of that, there is considerable misinformation in queries about earnings strangles.\n\nThe most common warning I read is about IV crush, which does actually happen, but is irrelevant. A strangle during earnings is essential a tail-event bet, and the successful strangle will have one of the legs running close to one-delta and other option close to zero. The final movement of the underlying is in the aftermarket after earnings (if earnings are EOD, normally the case) and for the successful strangle will be a large discontinuity.\n\nWith any leg above delta 0.80 (abs value), maybe the options that are currently at the money (which in a good trade are very far away) go through \"IV crush,\" but that is not relevant to your trade. You don't hold those options.\n\nYou cited apple so let's use AAPL as an example. [This is from an actual trade]:\n\nAAPL reported EOD on Thur July 30, 2020.\n\nOn Monday, July 27, at 09:43 PDT when AAPL was moving around 383 purchased a Jul 31 375 Put for 9.11 and a 377.5 Call at 8.47. Daily IV for both was very high, above 0.03, and that would rise to above 0.04 as Thursday approached.\n\nAAPL had the right kind of earnings report (sweetened with the promise of a stock split), so AAPL opening Friday at around 410 [I am not looking at the underlying data here, just the option data] and moved through the day to 426.31, which gave the call option an intrinsic value of 48.81, an amount equal to 2.75 times the cost of the original strangle.\n\nThe call's delta was one and the put was trading for 0.02. \"IV crush\" was of no relevance.\n\nThat is essentially the end of this story EXCEPT in this case, because of the split promise I exercised all of the calls, essentially buying AAPL for 377.5 at a time that it was trading at 425. By the time AAPL was ready to split it was trading at 500, and when it did split on August 31, the 4-1 shares were trading around 125 and started to rise, so I finally exited the trade.\n\nNow that, of course is an exceptional example - a dream come true for a strangle trader. But more recently ZM did far better, as any strangle will do when the underlying closes on the eve of earnings 325.10 and opens the next morning at 457.69. I don't have specs for the options because alas, I didn't trade it nor track it.\n\nTo provide a little balance, a strangle on TSLA's earnings would have been a disaster. TSLA is too crazy and was too expensive to do strangles on, but the contract that I tracked (had considered trading) would have cost $25,135 and would have lost $15,116!\n\nIn the long run my experience has been about 60% losses and 40% wins. Part of the trading discipline required is to minimize the losses, because a single large gain can cover 3, 4, or 5 losses.\n\nOf those that I played or tracked in this earnings season:\n\nNFLX - 40% gain (did not play)\n\nTSLA - huge loss [80%?] (did not play)\n\nINTC - 150% gain [put side]\n\nTWTR - 40% loss\n\nMSFT - 50% loss\n\nFB - 25% gain\n\nAMD - break even\n\nTDOC - huge loss, about 80% (did  not play)\n\nSHOP - 50% gain (did not play)\n\nAAPL - 8.5-fold massive gain\n\nTWLO - close at market open: break even, wait: large loss (did not play)\n\nUBER - 60% loss (did not play)\n\nZM - huge profits, possibly 300% (did not play)\n\nFinally I will answer your question: strangles are better than straddles, because, having approximately the same delta, the bet is directionally neutral. The straddle, with one of the legs ITM , will have the delta favoring the ITM leg, which is not a neutral bet.\n\nI have not evaluated WORK, PLTN, and LULU, so I don't want to encourage nor discourage that bet. \n\nTrading strangles IS DIFFICULT because you have to have a good screener. Mine was wound too tight this last time - it kept me out of too many trades (I have a rule to never trade TSLA options, so that would not have happened). My strangles are machine-traded.
