{"title": "home depot / commodities markets /DD/ questions", "selftext": "$HD a family friend does contracting and construction in NYC. I've been talking to him, he says the past 2 months or so, things like wooden braces, random metal clasps and what not (just basic construction materials for gut renovation of nyc apartments) have been either out of stock, or cost 150% more than the same time last year. The stuff he mentioned was mostly lumber and metal basic materials. He's convinced it has to do with China sanctions. \nSpot prices of futures for iron pellets and lumber seemed to already have run up. Honestly, trying understand the global interdepencadies of all this stuff is probably worthless and priced in and there's got to be so much info that I am just not aware of or not looking at. But I'm thinking that big money has been, and might continue going into commodoties ( iron pellets, lumber, soybeans, corn etc) since there seem to be at least some degree of shortages in the US, and may continue to be if trade talks with China fall through/continue to fall through. \n\nSoybeans are another commodity IIRC we used to get a lot of from China. plenty of soybeans are produce in the US, but in the past decade soybean products have hit supermarkets and are in nearly everything, along with their function in the vegan/vegetarian products, which seems to be a growing market.\n\nso all in all, I'm wondering if someone with a little more experience with global commodities markets could maybe share some insight. I guess my thesis is that without stable commodity prices, pricing of everyday consumer goods will start to go up. What im unsure about is how it will effect the stock price of companies ike HD/WMT/ etc. if we are starting to see shortages in commodities. \n\nAnother question is how to gain exposure to lumber / iron / soybean markets through US equities, rather than trading futures, and if that is even worth it/if there are too many more variables added to the equation with trading iron miners, lumber mills, soybean farms .\n\nI looked into top publicly traded steel and iron producers in the US ( https://www.dividend.com/dividend-stocks/basic-materials/steel-and-iron/#tm=3-industry-stocks&r=ES%3A%3ADividendStock%3A%3AStock%23SID--NYSE&f_2=steel-and-iron&only=meta%2Cdata%2Cthead ) and it doesn't seem like any of them are really following the increase of futures spot price. Just wondering what the best way is to gain exposure to each of these markets without trading futures.
