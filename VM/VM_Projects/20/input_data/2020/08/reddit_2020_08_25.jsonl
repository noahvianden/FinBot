{"title": "Puts on HYG", "selftext": "Before I begin, I'd like to preface this DD by saying I only started trading in June. Since then, I've gained a lot of money, and I've lost a lot of money. My best predictions so far have been:\n\nTSM 80c 8/21 and 8/28 bought around 67 before the run-up \n\nFSLY 80p 8/7 bought before earnings sent it to 116, then I held til it went all the way down to 77\n\nAAPL 500c 8/21 which didn't go ITM, but we all saw what happened there. \n\nSo, recently, I've been doing my own DD rather than listening to the retards in the daily chat, as it seems we've been invaded by penny stocks. Due to this, I've been a little less active. My most recent trade to hit was SPY 342 8/24. \n\nI'm looking at the top 50 highest open-interest stocks, or basically seeing which options have the most amount contracts open. Not necessarily a great way to decide how to buy stocks, but it is a good way to track volume, where the trends are moving, and sometimes see outliers, like the TSM 80c on 8/28 that hit and made a lot of people rich. \n\nI noticed a stock called HYG, which people don't really talk about on this sub. HYG is iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF - basically it tracks corporate debt, including junk bonds, but is much more stable than investing in junk bonds, as it will increase with these bonds, but will not dip nearly as bad if these bonds experience issues. One thing that immediately stood out was how high the put-to-call ratio was. Other sticks were more-or-less around 1, with the highs being around 1.66 and the low being around .51. The p-t-c ratio of HYG? 5.67. Yes you read that right - five point fucking six seven. \n\nI decided not to stop there. I looked at its dips in the past - it's high was around 88, but its low was only 67, and happened during the market crash in February. The crazy thing? It went right back up to high 70s, then back into the 80s diary quickly. Right now it is sitting at 85ish. So this made me think twice about going into this stock - if it's so stable, why would people all of a sudden think they should buy puts on this stock, if it'll just bounce right back? \n\nAfter digging around, I found this article that isn't really worth reading, but it had one fact I hadn't seen yet: the Fed is slated to stop buying corporate bonds on September 30th, and some people don't think they should keep buying them up after that date ends. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/opinion/articles/2020-06-15/fed-doesn-t-really-need-to-buy-corporate-bonds\n\nI started looking at different DTEs. I noticed September 18th, they had strikes with 100s of thousands of open contracts. Even the ones around those had 10s of thousands of contracts open. I did some more reading - found that some of those contracts were coming from hedges (people buying puts after buying shares, or hedge funds). This explains the vast amount of contracts. The thing that made it even more interesting was that over the next several months, the open interest on strikes such as 82 and 79 stayed really consistent. Like 10s of thousands of open interest all the way into January. \n\nThat's when I decided I should buy puts, but I didn't know what date I should go far. My hypothesis: if a lot of people expect things to go to shit in September, but the Fed isn't supposed to stop buying until after September, the date in which it goes to shit could change. So, I am recommending a few different strikes:\n\nHYG 9/18 83p \nHYG 10/16 82p\nHYG 11/20 79p\n\nOr some variance of those strikes and you should be good literally can't go tits up.", "id": "igdrue", "created_utc": 1598367467.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "First, you should probably understand how bond etfs, bond yields, and bond prices work.
