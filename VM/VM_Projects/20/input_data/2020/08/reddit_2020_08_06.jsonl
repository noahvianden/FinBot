E.g. in my country it's about 3.4 officially but about 8 in reality. The jump is noticeable at services y/y. Inflation is not just about upping prices when in e.g. shop: they keep the same prices but reduce the size of a product (let's say toilet paper with smaller rolls), or add more unhealthy crap to food (carrots get big but have way less vitamins than the normal size from your garden).\n\nTo add on this, by the time the next crisis hits decades later, the rates will probably be already separated: govt/institutions will get their rates lowered like now to keep them away from bankrupcy & devalue debt, while your usual citizens will have their rates increased from what I've heard.

Earnings is 19th August - They were one of the few stores open + with the amount of guns and ammo they sold during the \"peaceful protests\" I'm expecting they will have more revenue than Microsoft.\n3. Technically, to a geometrically challenged retard like me, it looks like what is commonly called a \"fagging formation\", where it had a big move from $118 to $132 and has consolidated there. I've heard gypsies, mystics and clairvoyants and say that \"fags fuck with half masts\", I don't know where this comes from, but it suggests that the next move should be the equivalent to the initial move and would take us to $146, so yeah, that's pretty conclusive.\n4. Stimulus Talks - probably the biggest unknown is what happens at the end of this week with the stimulus negotiations and how that impacts the market. You can wait until next week to see how they play out which is probably the safer bet, but if there's a positive outcome you could miss a bit of a general market pump.\n5.
