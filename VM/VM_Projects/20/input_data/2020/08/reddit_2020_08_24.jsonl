Just to avoid any pin risk with after hours price swings. By market close you could think everything went great, and wake up Monday to a loss. \n\nIf your spread is profitable, I would close both legs as a multiple order on the day of expiration or before depending on your % of P/L captured, which you should be able to do provided the volume is there (it should be on tech stock). If not, I'd close the short leg first, and then close the long leg second. \n\nTheta is daily time value decay on the option. The high delta would be helpful in your case of buying, but since you'd be buying ATM and selling OTM it wouldn't really offset the theta decay because there would be little to no intrinsic value. Buying ATM & OTM calls generally have lower % of being profitable by the time they expire. \n\nYou'd be better off buying a slightly ITM call with a higher delta and selling an ATM or OTM call to help offset the cost and theta decay. Intrinsic value is the amount by which your option is ITM. Intrinsic value is NOT affected by theta decay. I'd recommend checking out more about options Greeks to get a firmer understanding of how they react to price swings. \n\nYou can do that here: https://investorplace.com/2009/07/what-is-options-delta/#:~:text=When%20you%20buy%20options%20with,trades%20down%20a%20few%20points.\n\nSimply put if you bought ATM and sold OTM and the stock didn't go up by at least $5 into your short leg relatively quickly, you would likely lose money to theta decay. \n\nIf you're bullish on the underlying's you referenced, I think inverting your strategy and selling OTM put spreads with a 30-35 delta would be more profitable and expose you to less risk. This would put the theta in your favor, delta too, and you would also be receiving net credit, instead of paying out debit upfront. \n\nHope that helps bro.

{"title": "Hi, I'm an investor-wannabe - how wrong and destined-for-failure is my \"investment plan\" really?", "selftext": "As my name says, I have a somewhat successful gaming YT channel that provides me with a few hundred $ of extra cash every month, at least for now. It's volatile, but it's been on an upward trend ever since the pandemic broke out and people watch YT way more than before.\n\nCurrent global situation dictates that the worst option is to just keep this extra cash laying around depreciating due to inflation. I also don't want to just put it in a bank account, interest rates are of no use either. And, even if I lose all my savings in the stock market, at least I'll come out of it knowing what NOT to do the next time I dump money into it.Of course, the ideal outcome would be to prevent such a case, so that's why I'm writing this wall of text, asking for guidance from, hopefully, more experienced members of this community.\n\nNow, I've been getting gradually obsessed with the stock market since August 14th. I bought 2 Hasbro (HAS) stocks right away, because that company owns a game my YT channel is about, so I naturally just dumped some cash into it. Now, 10 days later, I went on quite a bit of a shopping spree and own these stocks:  \n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cZ2rNqW123eTj7rapyWNWC-zHEaLs79njlHEIJRY1\\_U/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cZ2rNqW123eTj7rapyWNWC-zHEaLs79njlHEIJRY1_U/edit?usp=sharing)  \n(stocks below the gray row are just there to keep track of them, I don't have that much money to burn in a month :) )  \n\n\nAfter obsessive research, I'm perfectly aware this is a HIGHLY speculative and not at all safe/balanced way to park excess cash. Also, there's nothing long-term about it. I'm not worried about short term losses, I'm in this for the long run, at least 5, maybe even 10 years. However, I'm worried, for example, that NVDA is gonna finally crash tomorrow because it's clearly overvalued (I was clueless about that issue when I bought it), I'm worried that TDOC is just gonna ween off and never grow back up to $200+ levels even after the LVGO merger and, well, I'm worried that this will ultimately end up being another one of my failures. I'm OK with losing the money, but again, if it could be prevented, why waste it?\n\nHowever, I'm not just going to sell and cut my loses and give up. I've dealt with problems and issues all my life, so, after a fair few days of trying to grasp the crux of the issue, I'm somewhat familiar with most of the stock market/investing terms and I believe I have a basic, but hopefully sufficient understanding of the stock market as a whole.\n\nNow, among many others, I watched this video  \n[https://youtu.be/xexqXNxQ5fU](https://youtu.be/xexqXNxQ5fU)  \nTL:DW he basically has 50-70% of the entire portfolio in just 3 stocks -  1 growth (TSLA), 1 value (FB), 1 dividend (SKWS). The way I see this, all 3  are just basically growth stocks of different kinds, especially SKWS with its low dividend yield and cyclical growth. But, it can't be denied he got dem gains and a solid track record.  He says the entire portfolio shouldn't have more than 15 stocks for most  people.\n\nSo, some plan of action is better than no plan of action and I feel like a strategy like this one may just be what could work for me.\n\nObviously, I can't just copy what he did. TSLA is way overvalued right now and it's just a matter of time before it crashes or, ahem, market \"correction\" happens. SKWS I'm not interested in, I feel like it doesn't have much more room for growth and its dividend yield is abysmal.\n\nI don't want to just endlessly sit around and wait for a miracle to happen, but I don't want to rush this either, so I came up with rough draft of a course of action that seems plausibly viable to me. I don't expect this to 2x or even 1.5x my investment over the next few years, but if I could squeeze 25-30% overall gains over a period of 4-5 years, that would be an awesome starting point for me.\n\n**LONG-TERM GROWTH STOCKS**  \n\\-FB for its diversified social network portfolio, at least until 2023.

{"title": "OPINION (not DD!): Reducing AAPL position this week", "selftext": "Don’t get me wrong – **Apple Inc (**[**AAPL**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/)**)** has performed admirably. They’re probably one of the best run companies in the world, evidenced by being the first US company to eclipse $2 trillion in market capitalization. With that said, I’ve decided that barring anything unforeseen, this week will be the week that I exit Apple, and began selling at $507.87\n\nWhy? The simplest answer is I believe it’s run up too far, too fast. Even a zero interest rate environment doesn’t merit mature companies trading at 40 times earnings, which is where Apple appears to now be headed.\n\nWe have to remember that different companies come into and fall out of favor, and this last decade has been the “Apple Decade”. I believe with that so much of Apple’s future sales are already priced into the stock, there really isn’t much room for further growth. Even if it doesn’t fall (I’m not predicting a fall, but that could happen), the risk is a slowdown in the growth of its stock price as earnings slowly catch up.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin regarding my decision to sell is the crazy run-up its had since declaring its upcoming stock split. That day (July 30), AAPL opined at $376.85 and closed at $384.07. The stock has appreciated a full $120 per share in the days since that announcement, and while it posted solid earnings, I don’t think enough has fundamentally changed to merit the recent rise in price. \n\nPlease note that this post doesn’t guarantee that I will exit Apple (especially if the price should fall), nor does it guarantee I won’t repurchase it again at lower prices. But at this moment in time, I think any future growth potential is dwarfed by downside risk, so I am intent on averaging out of the position during the course of the week.", "id": "iftn53", "created_utc": 1598290565.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.35, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "I can’t disagree with any of this but, with the market as it is at the moment, who knows...

Plus, if anyone can pull off AR with glasses, I believe in Apple similar to the way it disrupted the watch market. I think there will be a few big pushes from Apple the next decade.

There might be a bump after models start shipping, but those will probably be delayed purchases rather than new purchases. I will accept that bringing chip production in house will mean that they can probably increase margins even further.\n\nAs for 5G, I continue to believe that that people will upgrade to the new  technology organically - moving from LTE only when they would have upgraded their phone, not rushing to upgrade because 5G is here. For instance, I intend to keep my Xr until next June at the earliest, though I certainly can't speak for everyone out there.\n\nBut the biggest point - a HUGE amount of apples current stock price has materialized with the announcement of their split. It's up fully $120 post split announcement, after an earnings call where honestly, things are going well for them, but nothing occurred that should indicate a 33% increase in price of the most valuable public company. \n\n40 times earnings isn't a sane valuation.

I was also around in the dot com crash (just starting out) and there is a big difference here; AAPL actually makes money. The late 90's were full of insane valuations on companies that lost money hand over fist, which isn't the case here.  \n\nI will admit that I wouldn't buy AAPL at its current price. I held AAPL before March and I scooped up a bunch more at 279.  If their services revenue keeps increasing like this they may well be undervalued still.

Services in particular, they grew the fastest, though they still are the smallest segment. We now have anti-trust concerns, and Epic just fired a shot over the bow of both Apple and Google. That's an uncertainty that i don't think is priced in.\n\nAnother uncertainty I don't think is priced in in the transition from Intel to Apple Silicon. Yes, Apple has pulled off two transitions thus far (68k to PPC and PPC to x86), each had its own set of challenges. ARM will be its own set of challenges as well. The reward will be greater battery life for users and increased profit margin for Apple. And thankfully for Apple, this time Mac isn't it's main revenue generator, so even if it doesn't go smoothly, it won't be a catastrophic wound. \n\nThat's all my thinking about Apple. I'll be more than happy to buy back into them on future dips, but I just think that now is as good a time as any to stand on the sidelines and look for other opportunities, even invest further into other ideas. :)\n\n(PS I am amused that my post was voted down to 0.
