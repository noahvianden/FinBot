{"title": "Analysis of Scion Asset Management 13-F Filing", "selftext": "I am not one to typically follow or pay attention to the investing of those that consider themselves \"professionals\", but when it comes to the man, the myth, the legend, Dr. Michael Burry, I do. Recently, his fund, Scion Asset Management, filed it's 13-F Filing and there was some interesting information in it. (Bear in mind, some of these positions could be a few months old, however since I am focusing on the call options in his portfolio many of these positions would most likely be long-term and therefore would still be valid investments). Of note, Burry had 16 call positions which represented 71.19% of his portfolio. I would suspect that these are LEAP options (at least one year options) and not short-term call options, which clearly shows that he believes the economy has seen the worst of the coronavirus and is poised for a recovery. The reason I suspect Burry is invested in LEAP options is due to their tendency to be mispriced and cheaper than holding a higher priced stock like GOOG or BKNG long-term. They would offer far more upside than just holding the stock itself. We also know from history that Michael Burry is not a short-term investor and his \"Big Short\" positions, which were also derivatives, took over one year to profit. With that in mind here are the companies that made up the biggest positions in his call options: \n\nGOOG (36% of his portfolio)\n\nFB (7%)\n\nBKNG (6%)\n\nGS (5%)\n\nWDC (4%)\n\nVarious other companies made up his other positions which primarily consisted of energy, retail, gaming (casino) and financial companies. All these companies are in sectors which are market laggards currently, but would increase dramatically with a market recovery, hence his use of call options. From looking at his portfolio, it is evident Michael Burry is bullish on the market and believes that it is set to recover. He is clearly betting on higher interest rates in the future (financial stocks), higher energy prices (energy stocks), higher consumer spending (retail stocks), increased discretionary spending (casino/gaming/travel stocks), and overall increase in the dominant tech stocks (FB/GOOG). I think this is a solid portfolio and thesis. I am not one to argue with the legend and I will be following his lead into some of the stocks he has bought. Specifically GOOG, WYNN, LVS, JPM, BAC, GS calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLINK TO OVERVIEW OF THE 13-F filing:\n\n [https://fintel.io/i13f/scion-asset-management-llc/2020-06-30-0](https://fintel.io/i13f/scion-asset-management-llc/2020-06-30-0)", "id": "ibtyyf", "created_utc": 1597723539.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "give me my fucking money back, you mother fucker", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "I have followed him for some time and geeze he has had some whopper losers past couple years.

{"title": "In the deepest, darkest corners of WSB…", "selftext": "I like to think I represent a dark corner of WSB where popular meme stocks are eschewed in favor of less well known companies with astronomical upside. (See my previous posts on ONEW and GPRE at [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf8emm/i\\_was\\_a\\_bar\\_tender\\_now\\_i\\_own\\_a\\_boat/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gf8emm/i_was_a_bar_tender_now_i_own_a_boat/) and [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjsjbj/how\\_can\\_this\\_possibly\\_go\\_wrong/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gjsjbj/how_can_this_possibly_go_wrong/)).\n\nNow I have a new bet. It’s a risky one but it may leave the 2-3Xers in the dust.\n\nThe fundamental thesis is simple: it’s a three-pillar electric vehicle trade without the baggage of manufacturing issues and vehicle market share considerations. The company is Greenland Minerals (GDLNF) and it holds one of the largest rare-earth deposits in the world. There is also a secret technical (non-fundamental) kicker that I’ll get to later (which is also the reason this post is better for WSB than the goofs at r/investing).\n\n**Three Pillars of the Fundamental Thesis**\n\n1. EVs Need Rare Earths\n\nRare earths, widely known to be a required component of EV production, will see their demand base rise as EVs take off. Over the past month, while Tesla’s equity has risen about 30%, shares of GDLNF are up 100%. The leveraged relationship between EVs and rare earths has been covered in depth by many sources so I’m not going to waste time here. Moving on to pillar two.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5wi4jolx5th51.png?width=1970&format=png&auto=webp&s=979aba4af2f94293624616b23396ac41e3773c3c\n\n2. EVs Need a Supply Chain Outside of China\n\nAlmost as important as securing rare earths supply outright for EV production is securing supply outside of China, which currently represents over 90 percent of rare earth extraction. With nationalism and protectionism rising in both the US and China, the US and other countries see the need to diversify their sources of supply in order to maintain secure supply chains. Greenland’s enormous mineral deposits may end up in a bidding war between the US and China, given that Greenland is a stable country with strong laws that will allow mining but not open itself up to outside control. A common refrain in the country is, “We are not for sale, but we are open for business.” Indeed, the Chinese have already staked a claim to 12.5 percent of Greenland Minerals, setting the bidding war in motion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. EVs Need Electricity\n\nThe last pillar is the most obvious in its premise but most interesting in its implication. The fact that electric vehicles need electricity is plain as day to everyone in the industry, but much less appreciated is where the electricity is going to come from. With green energy policies strengthening around the world, renewables like wind and solar are getting a lot of attention, but anyone who has closely examined the energy balance knows that it will likely be impossible to achieve zero carbon emissions without substantial new investments in nuclear power. And that’s where things get interesting for GDLNF: it has substantial uranium deposits in addition to its rare earth reserves. Uranium prices have been on a tear this year. I may write about that industry in more detail in another post, but suffice it to say that a doubling or tripling of uranium prices could be required to balance supply with upcoming demand. Shares of exploration companies like GDLNF typically move up by multiples of the underlying commodity move (just see recent gold miner moves for evidence). Buckle up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Fourth Pillar (Please Read Carefully)**\n\nIf the three pillars of the fundamental thesis aren’t enough, there’s a technical factor related to an obscure ETF that could boost Greenland Minerals’ shares in the short term. This is the fourth pillar, but it’s a time sensitive one, and it's why I'm posting here in WSB rather than r/investing. Any day now, a uranium-focused ETF called URA is going to rebalance itself from being 50/50 pure play vs non-pure play to 70/30 pure play vs non-pure play. URA likely holds Greenland Minerals as a NON-PURE PLAY pick, because the company's uranium deposits are only a part of its reserves and it mainly casts itself as a rare-earths company. At first blush, it would appear that Greenland Minerals would be at risk of having its shares divested from URA when URA shifts 20% of its holdings from non-pure play to pure play. But in fact, in special guidelines that were released by the indexer that URA is based on (Solactive Global Uranium & Nuclear Components Total Return Index, see [https://www.solactive.com/indices/?se=1&index=DE000SLA4825](https://www.solactive.com/indices/?se=1&index=DE000SLA4825)), the indexer reveals that the number of non-pure play companies covered will be capped at 15 and that each non-pure play company will be capped at 2% of the index’s assets. Effectively, rather than representing some degree of flexibility, these two constraints in fact seem to require that there must be 15 non-pure play companies held with exactly 2% of holdings in each one, in order to meet the new 30% non-pure play allocation (2%x15=30%). To accomplish this, the ETF will probably sell shares of its largest non-pure play companies and buy shares of its smaller holdings like GDLNF. So as long as Greenland Minerals is one of the non-pure play companies held after the rebalancing (which seems likely given that it is already 0.579% of the URA’s holdings as of 8/17/2020), then the ETF would probably have to nearly QUADRUPLE its holdings in Greenland Minerals in order to be consistent with the indexer’s rules. This would represent an inflow of more than $3 million to a stock whose daily traded value is about $500,000; *in other words, this rebalancing, which will take place any day now (perhaps lasting several days), could swamp the normal market activity will a tsunami of buy orders.*\n\n**TL,DR: GDLNF could roof in the short term and remain a great bet in the long term.**\n\nI am positioned accordingly with 30,000 shares of GDLNF, but do you own DD before buying. In particular, don’t believe me about the idiosyncrasies of ETF holdings unless you double-check the ideas for yourself, because it can get a bit complicated. I expect any ETF-related buying potential to play out over the next week or two.\n\nEDIT: The indexer (Solactive) has actually announced that GDLNF is not a part of the new index make-up, unfortunately, so we're probably not going to see the short-term bump I was hoping for, but long term fundamentals are unchanged.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qce88inu4th51.png?width=1896&format=png&auto=webp&s=f06bd2a490def1d6d0d67e63dbffe52d0f3bbb83", "id": "ic7c2l", "created_utc": 1597777343.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Not on Robinhood! 😡😡😡", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "URA is on RH", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "No Robinhood?
