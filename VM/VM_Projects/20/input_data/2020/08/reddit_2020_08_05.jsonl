It is ALWAYS busy and they were very fast to adopt strong Covid protocols. Last few weeks I've been in to get little things and it looks like it always has been. Busy. It's just a great shopping experience.\n\nI like the 9/18 140c with earnings being released in 2 weeks (I'd be closer to the money if I had more cash). A lot of retailers have beaten expectations over the past few weeks and I think Target will blow them out of the water. They exceeded estimates by a 34% surprise factor in Q1. Revenue estimates are only a tick above Q1, but with all the summer shopping and gearing up for back-to-school it has to be much bigger. Q1 actual revenue was 19.6b with Q2 estimated at only 19.5b (but it's been busier over the past few months than at any time I was there in Q1).\n\nI'm no expert, just a homeless raccoon, so by no means does this post mean anything.
