{"title": "I build a tool which calculates optimal option strategies and now need some feedback", "selftext": "Hi there,\n\nI've been (mostly) lurking on here for the past year. During that time, I saw a many people lose money where they shouldn't have lost money. This was especially frustrating when people were spot on with their prediction where a stock is going and still lost money because they didn't use options correctly. Or even more frequently, one could have made a lot more money with a different strategy which still would have been reasonable or by using different strike prices.\n\nThis lead me to the creation of a tool over the past few months which does the following:\n\n1. You tell it where you think a stock is going, for example TSLA being at $450 in three weeks or SPY $300 next week.\n2. The tool then takes a look at a lot of different strategies, including all kind of call / put credit / debit spreads, iron condors, even FDs and finds the most profitable one under your prediction.\n3. This optimal strategy is then neatly presented to you along with a PNL graph, some metrics etc.\n\nThis tool is now available at [velistos.com](https://velistos.com), the first ten people can use the code \"optimalautism\" to access the optimizer. I'd love some feedback on the optimizer :)\n\n**TLDR:** Go to [velistos.com](https://velistos.com) and use the code \"optimalautism\" to beta-test a tool that calculates optimal option strategies.", "id": "jkc3ui", "created_utc": 1603985261.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "How is \"optimal\" defined?

So the optimizer does not take the win rate, it instead takes statements like \"The probability of TSLA being at $410 is 10%, 15% for $420, 20% for $425, 15% 430, etc\". This makes it possible to rate a strategy by calculating the expected return (basically profit at price x times probability of price x) of that strategy. And that can be optimized in the sense of \"there is no other strategy which has a higher expected return\".  \nAs far as holding time is concerned, the tool currently assumes that a position is opened at the current price and closed at the given date. That is one of the current shortcomings of the optimizer.

{"title": "Pinterest‚Äôs pandemic surge continues, stock jumps more than 25% toward fresh record highs", "selftext": "Pinterest thrashes earnings estimates while adding another 26 million active users, stock again heads for big gains after earnings and pushes Twitter and Facebook shares higher too.\n\nPinterest Inc. continued to experience a surge in new users during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to larger-than-expected profit and revenue growth this summer, according to a Wednesday earnings report that sent shares on another ride toward fresh record highs.\n\nPinterest PINS reported a third-quarter loss of $94.2 million, or 16 cents a share, on revenue of $442.6 million, up from $280 million a year ago. After adjusting for stock-based compensation and other factors, the company reported earnings of 13 cents a share, up from adjusted earnings of a penny a share a year ago. Analysts on average expected adjusted earnings of 4 cents a share on sales of $383 million.\n\nPinterest shares jumped more than 25% in after-hours trading following the report, after closing with a 7.1% decline at $48.78. Shares were topping $63 in the extended session after closing with a 6.2% decline at $49.25; Pinterest shares have never traded for higher than $53.87 in regular trading.\n\nPinterest shares have more than doubled to record highs since the social-media company‚Äôs last earnings report, which predicted much higher revenue and user growth than previously expected. The online-advertising market seems to have found strength despite the pandemic, as strong third-quarter financial results last week from Snap Inc. SNAP sent stocks in ad-supported online companies higher across the board.\n\nOnline-ad stocks also experienced a jump after Pinterest‚Äôs report, which arrived 24 hours ahead of quarterly reports from online-ad powerhouses Facebook Inc. FB , Alphabet Inc. GOOGL GOOG and Twitter Inc. TWTR . Twitter shares gained more than 5% in the extended session Wednesday, while Facebook stock increased more than 2% and Google parent Alphabet added about 1%.\n\nPinterest executives said they expect revenue to grow around 60% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, roughly in line with the 58% growth in the third quarter. Pinterest reported revenue of $400 million in last year‚Äôs holiday period, so the guidance suggests sales of about $640 million this year, which again trounces expectations. Analysts on average predicted fourth-quarter revenue of $541 million, according to FactSet.\n\nPinterest stock has gained 165% so far this year, and more than 106% in the past three months, as the S&P 500 SPX index has gained 5% and 5.4% in those periods.\n\n[Source](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/surge-in-pandemic-pinterest-users-continues-stock-jumps-more-than-20-toward-more-record-highs-11603916620)", "id": "jk0lug", "created_utc": 1603933632.0, "score": 60, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "Bought more today during regular trading hours...had a feeling it would roar yet again just like last earnings release and was encouraged by SNAP's recent pop as well. \n\nDare I say, PINS will roar again at next earnings release as it is demonstrating 60% growth!

This is huge news because up until now NVIDEA has apparently dominated this space.  He states \"NVIDIAs top GPU the RTX 3090 sells for $1,499.99 and draws 350W and its one of the largest GPUs ever in terms of physical size. AMD took some shots. They released the RX 6900XT for $999.99 only draws 300W and it's the same size as your average GPU.  The only thing the 3090 has is more memory 24Gb vs 16GB but honestly that shouldn't matter.\"  He further states \"They should be getting a lot of sales on both cpu and GPUs because they also made this technology that when you pair one of their cpu with one of their GPUs you automatically unlock this feature NVIDIA and intel cannot provide.  Same feature that's going to allow the new consoles to load games so quickly and just boost the performance.\"  He finishes \"Streams of revenue PS5, XboxseriesX, CPUs (consumer laptops/desktops, high end gaming/workstations, servers google + Microsoft deals) and now GPUs.\"\n\nSo what does all this mean?
