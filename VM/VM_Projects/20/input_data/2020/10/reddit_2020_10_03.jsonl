{"title": "TSLA Covered calls, minimizing risk of losing shares", "selftext": "Hi boys and girls,\n\nI'm new to options, but I have been doing quite a bit of research on the topic. I only started investing about a year ago (\\~90% TSLA) and the returns have been outerworldly. However, the insane growth of TSLA seems to be slowing, so I think it's time to start selling covered calls. I'd like to keep the shares, so I want to minimize the risk of my shares being called away.\n\nHistorical price data from oct 2015 to oct 2020 shows that the largest increase between monday market open and friday market close was 31,8%.

Am I missing something crucial? What do you think about this strategy? Is there a risk of the calls being excercised before expiration? Any and all help is greatly appreciated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit:**\n\nNow I know that the option can get excercised before expiration, so I also looked at the highs for every day and compared those to opening on monday.

This can only be done with good 3D reconstruction, which is the next FSD update. This is bigger than people think. It's not image stitching. It's code for FSD massive leap.\n\nI just rewatched Tesla's Autonomy Day. Key takeaways from rewatching.\n\n1) The technology they had back then was making predictions using neural network convolutions on 2D images. 2D images are correctly very primitive compared to 3D reconstructions. 2D images have no understanding of depth. Autonomy day did show 3D reconstructions, but they were very poor, and implied they were only used internally for developers to use, and the neural network did not make predictions on them.\n\n2) There was no convolution over time. They manually labelled data per image. However, they did have Dojo which processed video streams. Convolving over time likely saved massively on annotation costs (unsupervised learning) and massively improved predictive accuracy.\n\n3) If they are now inferring from 3D reconstructions, it may use a different hardware architecture than 2D neural nets, which will mean a new HW 4.0 chip. This will probably be the case, and they will likely also develop one to save on energy and material costs.\n\n4) Heard a familiar voice in the Q&A. Dave Lee!\n\n5) Dojo looks like it can be Tesla's big \"AWS\" moment. Unsupervised learning at scale with video feed? This could be the key platform that people use to train their NNs, and facilitate explosion in video based ML. Furthermore, the fact that Tesla is going beyond 2.5D training into 4D training means Dojo is even more general than we thought and can accomodate more applications. This is a huge addressable market here.\n\n\nDon't sleep on Vector Space Birds Eye view. To achieve birds eye vector space, you need REALLY GOOD environmental representation. Otherwise, it will look poor / unusable. Releasing this is endgame for FSD.\n\nEDIT: If you want to be mind blown, take a look at this other video of pseudo lidar using a single camera (not multiple). https://youtu.be/b62iDkLgGSI.

This is the 4D time based AI we are looking at. Furthermore, the current vector space is pretty rough. Cars still abruptly change position, things jitter in place, cones aren't always in the exact position they should be. The 3D reconstruction from autonomy day was VERY course.

{"title": "Unity ($U) - Before you sell puts / decide to wheel", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nHi All,\n\nA wrote [my take on Asana](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/j387xq/asana_asan_before_you_wheel/) ($ASAN) a few days ago, which some of you found useful. There were also requests for covering other IPOs. So to continue the thread forward, I have written my take on Unity ($U) below - another company which had a spectacular IPO debut. \n\nI have posted a summary version here. If you are interested in a more detailed version, you can find it here: [https://knowyourstocks.substack.com/p/unity-u-creating-the-future](https://knowyourstocks.substack.com/p/unity-u-creating-the-future)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Unity Software ($U)**\n\n\\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**What does it do?**\n\nUnity is a very cool company and an impressive business. It makes two types of products:\n\n**Create Solutions: 30% of revenue**\n\nSoftware which allows creators (artists, developers etc.) to develop many different types of content across platforms (Mobile, PC, incl. Virtual Reality). The company charges a monthly subscription fee for this solution, across various tiers. Smash hit *Pokemon Go* was built on Unity.\n\n**Operate Solutions: 61% of revenue**\n\nA wide variety of software and solutions that allow content / game creators to operate and monetize their games (e.g. analytics to optimize engagement, In-App Purchases). Unity charges a share of the revenue that content /game creators make or sometimes usage based fee. This is a healthy business model as it grows with the usage of any game / content using Unity operate solutions.\n\nKey to note here is that customers can use Operate solutions even on content that was not created on Unity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I like:**\n\n* High gross margins (80%)\n* Large Gaming TAM ($12B, growing at 6%) and Non Gaming TAM ($17B)\n* Lot of room to grow in Non Gaming category\n* Accelerating revenue growth, but cost efficient\n* Asymmetric opportunity to benefit if VR becomes a dominant technology in future\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I don’t like:**\n\n* Platform risk (dependency on Apple / Google)\n* Dynamic competition leading to pressure on free cash flows\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing I really liked about Unity was their focus to grow their large customers (>$100k TTM revenue) from 389 to 716 in last 10 quarters. This results in a lot of sales efficiency.\n\nAdditionally, their dollar net expansion rate is 122-142% in the last 10 quarters (this means a customer who spent $100 last quarter, spend $122-$142 this quarter - a very positive sign). Unity’s net expansion rates are in the upper quartile of all high growth SaaS companies.\n\nOne of the key risks I see with Unity is platform risk. As we saw with Epic games recently, Google and Apple control Unity’s access to its customers and this poses platform risk for Unity.  This is a serious issue and not unique to them, but they have to find a way around this. Their foray outside gaming should help to some extent.\n\nAnother key point is that they are in an industry where they have to constantly innovate and have dynamic competition. Their R&D cost grew by 40% YoY to $167M in H1, 2020 and now represent 47% of its revenue. This is quite high and a drain on cash flows. Unity has to continue to perform well on revenue growth, else cash flows can suffer a lot in future which will become a risk on stock price.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**For Options trading**\n\nUnity had a spectacular IPO (no surprises) on Sept 18, and since then has gone on to reach a market cap of $22B (\\~$83.5 / share, ending Friday Oct 2, 2020), resulting in an EV / Sales (TTM) of 35.3.  This valuation puts it in the category of other high growth SaaS companies like Docusign, Cloudflare who are also growing revenue upwards of 40%. \n\nOverall I like Unity’s leading position, and its future growth prospects. The valuations are quite rich as is with the sector in general. I would look for any decent drop as a good opportunity for opening new positions.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you continue to find this post useful, please let me know - I will cover other exciting IPOs like Snowflake ($SNOW), JFROG ($FROG), Sumo Logic ($SUMO), Amwell ($AMWL) and Palantir ($PLTR) in future posts.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI write about stocks in my weekly newsletter @ [knowyourstocks.substack.com](https://knowyourstocks.substack.com/)\n\n**Disclaimer** \\- This post is just meant for information purposes.

It won't happen and they also have large cash cows from plenty of other console, VR and PC games.\n\nCompetition is only from Unreal right now - Nothing else even comes close.

Your manic episodes are just that -- manic episodes. And if you only trade well on manic episodes, you will be tempted to relapse this week. FOMO must be tamed at all cost. All moves should be deliberate and slow, with realistic loss tolerances this week. Not one to react to large losses at first, the true toll of such behavior manifests slowly over time, and could set you off course. Caution is the key word here, Sag.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nDISCLAIMER:\n\nThis is not financial advice. If you take it as such, you will incur rapid and substantial losses. But hey, just last week you yolo'd 5 figures into a company you heard about from a 2 sentence post in all lowercase, so you already know a thing or two about rapid and substantial losses.\n\nY'all know this is a casino right?
