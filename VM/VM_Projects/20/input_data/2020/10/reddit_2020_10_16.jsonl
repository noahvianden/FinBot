{"title": "Psycho Market Recap - Friday, October 16, 2020", "selftext": "Summary\n\nStocks traded mostly sideways today to end the day slightly negative as investors weighed disappointing news on the stimulus front, a challenging reopening with some places being forced to go back on partial quarantine measures, and a US election which is now less than 3 weeks away.\n\nFor the day the SPY was down 0.07%, the QQQ down 0.57%, and the DIA incredibly up 0.37%. This price action, hints to a rotation out of the high flying names and into the reopening of the economy and more industrial names.\n\nOn the COVID front, this week was difficult as cases in the US have topped 8 Million. Furthermore, two of the vaccine frontrunners, Johnson and Johnson and Eli Lilly halted their trials due to safety and quality concerns. Also the CEO of Pfizer today stated that the company would not apply for emergency use authorization of its vaccine any earlier than the third week of November.\n\nThe United States Budget Deficit has increased to a record $3.1Trillion in fiscal year 2020. In comparison to last year's, it has tripled in size, mostly due to the measures put in place in response to the COVID pandemic. As a share of GDP this represents 16%, the largest since WWII, to put this into context in the 2009 crisis it reached almost 10% at its peak. The biggest chunk of spending came as federal spending jumped 47% due to increased unemployment compensation needs. Still Fed Chair Jerome Powell as soon as last week kept warning that recovery will be fragile and more so without additional aid from Congress and added that providing too much stimulus shouldn‚Äôt be a problem, according to a report by Bloomberg.\n\nThe figures for retail sales for the month of September have been reported today and they show that US retail sales have grown for the 5th month in a row driven by strong spending in clothing, cars and sporting goods, according to a report published by MarketBeat. Sales jumped 1.9% which is more than double of the consensus estimate. ‚ÄúAmericans raced to the stores in September,‚Äù said BMO Capital Markets analyst Sal Guatieri, in a note to investors, adding that they were ‚Äúbuying just about everything in sight, especially clothing.‚Äù\n\nIn Europe things have been shaky as the U.K. faces resurgence in COVID cases, and a bumpy BREXIT negotiation. Partial quarantine measures have been put back in place, and negotiations between the U.K. and European Union will continue next week. Boris Johnson has told Bloomberg that he believes a deal is unlikely.\n\nHighlights\n\n* A new plan was unveiled today to get COVID shots to nursing homes, even though such a vaccine does not yet exist. This led to skepticism from experts. Under the program, trained staff from CVS (CVS) and Walgreens (WBA) would deliver the vaccines and administer the shots.\n* Volkswagen nearing a deal with Carl Icahn to buy Navistar (NAV)\n* Accolade (ACCD) had a price target increase from Morgan Stanley from $37 to $48 at OVERWEIGHT.

Why One Calls It 'a Long Term Winner.'", "selftext": "Stock in Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO continued its epic run on Thursday, after another analyst recommended buying the shares.\n\nNIO shares (ticker: NIO) were up 5.9% in afternoon trading. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, for comparison, were near the break-even line.\n\nHong Kong based Citigroup analyst Jeff Chung upgraded shares to the equivalent of Buy from Hold. His price target went to $33.20 from $18.10. Chung upgraded shares after his work suggested NIO sales had picked up in recent weeks.\n\nThe stock rose almost 23% on Wednesday following an upgrade from J.P. Morgan analyst Nick Lai, who wrote that he thinks EV penetration in China is set to quadruple between 2020 and 2025. He called NIO \"a long term winner in the premium space.\" His price target is $40 a share.\n\nLai and Fang aren't alone in their increasing bullishness. NIO stock has been upgraded to Buy four times since June.\n\nHowever, shortly after issuing a Buy recommendation, analyst Fei Fang at Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to Hold and then to Sell. The reason he turned bearish was stock-price appreciation. Shares rose almost 90% while he rated them Buy.\n\nFang was being disciplined about price targets and valuation. Still, NIO stock kept rising after the downgrade to Sell. Shares are up 150% since then and hit a 52-week intraday high on Thursday, trading at $29.30 before settling back down to around $28.\n\nThe stock run has been something to behold. Shares are up almost 600% year to date. But the gains are attracting more Buy recommendations. Roughly 65% of analysts covering the stock rate shares Buy. At the start of the year that number was closer to 15% -- when the stock traded for $4.02.\n\nAll EV stocks have done well in 2020. Stock in Tesla (TSLA), the EV behemoth, for instance, is up 435% year to date, making Elon Musk's company the most valuable auto maker in the world.\n\nAnalysts are having a hard time keeping up with EV stocks such as NIO.
