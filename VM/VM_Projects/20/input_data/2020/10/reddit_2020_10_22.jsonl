{"title": "About the useless narrative of \"GAAP profit driven by regulatory credit\"", "selftext": "I am baffled at the persisting narrative that Tesla would not make a GAAP profit without regulatory credits. Market Watch come up again with the same stale argument that Tesla and EM in particular is a \"juvenile\" entity playing with the prices of the cars without looking at the bottom line (referring to the recent Model S pricing of $69,420.00).\n\nI do not even know where to start to counter the rather \"uninformed\" commentary on Q3, but I will try a different way, maybe this will explain why anybody that looks at Q3-20 and the Q&A section and claims that regulatory credits are the only reason for Tesla GAAP profit should be discarded as a useless reading.\n\nFirst question you should ask yourself is why you are looking at financial information about a company. The most common reasons are: a) you are trying to buildup your initial capital, b) you are trying to keep your capital protected on a long term (you are retired, part of a retirement found etc..)\n\nBuilding up capital means you are willing to take some risk so you are looking at companies like Tesla; if you do not want taking some risk, simply look at buying something more stable.\n\nTech companies have the potential of quickly building up your investment capital, but you need to understand how a tech company works and, in particular, how technology innovation works.\n\nIn order to make ANY significant technology advance, a time period of 7 to 10  years and two generations of engineers were and are the norm in established fields. One generation of engineers were use to define the problem and the following generation was going to solve it. There were several reasons for this pace of innovation, and are still valid and applicable, mainly dealing with the fact that engineers and technicians usually get sandbagged by their own success and tend to replicate previously successful solution methods to new problems. \n\nThe solution to a technology problem follow the same S curve that is so famous in engineering circles: usually some group come up with a new tech or process, lead a rapid improvement in a product but then stabilizes in a path of smaller progressive improvements.   This is, usually, when a new generation of engineers come up with something new and the cycle repeat.\n\nIn order to sustain this innovation cycle, it must be recognized by the management of the companies, and actually encouraged. This means that every time a steady revenue is generated by slowly incremental upgrades, efforts should be directed in R&D to introduce real new tech that could revamp exponential growth.\n\nThis means that accounting results perceptions such as quarter over quarter or yoy or GAAP profit should be always evaluated in prospective with the company strategy, i.e long term goals usually 10 to 20 years. If a company goal are the tenure of the CEO, never mind, take your money and invest somewhere else unless you are already retired and aim at a steady income.\n\nTesla is investing at an incredible speed \\* ROI, basically aiming a \"real\" tech refresh over less then 5 years compared to the 7-10 years that companies were used to. They are accumulating  capital reserve fore even more radical changes in their production and technology structure and, by mission, they are aiming at acquiring market shares, that in the car industry, is driven by entry price for the same type of vehicle, doubling every $5000 price reduction.\n\nWhat the previous paragraph means is that  Tesla has taken the \"invest in tech\" paradigm to a completely new level, basic it has become a meta-tech company: Its products are not single technologies, but the process of producing new technologies! This is incredible ambitious, and EM himself seems in disbelief that it works and nobody has thought of it before, while the same concepts are taught in any respectable engineering course! \n\nWhen EM talks and says \"all our process are wrong, we are open to constantly change\", or \"we build the machine that build the machine that build the machine...\" or that Tesla is a conglomerate of 12 startups, he is explaining the real product of Tesla that is a constant Tech Innovation company.\n\nTools like GAAP are really not designed to project the picture of a \"meta company\" because they were honed at providing indication of a the health of company in the very short term, months to a year. They were and are good if that is the company goals (CEO tenure for example) but they become useless by themselves if the goal is to evaluate long term company strategies, see Amazon for example. \n\nAs usual, I agree with my wife and kids statement that I am wrong, an \"ok boomer\",  tending to a \"never mind grandpa...\" status, so disagreement with whatever I say really do not bother me, and may get me better insight in my own cluttered thinking.", "id": "jfx8c2", "created_utc": 1603363105.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "The argument that somehow regulatory credits cash payments Tesla receives are not \"real\" income is one of the final TSLAQ arguments left, and they are clinging desperately to it.\n\nIt's a false and borderline bizarre argument, ***especially*** in the context of Q3 results:\n\n- If you claim that it's a one-time benefit (it's not), then you have to add back one time *expenses* as well, such as the non-cash expense Tesla took in Q3 as Elon's (well deserved) CEO payment package caught up about ~10 quarters of missing milestones since 2018. In Q4 this charge will be a lot less. So if you argue that we should take off ~$300m of regulatory credits, can we also increase Tesla's Q3 GAAP earnings by ~$500m+ due to one time expenses as well, right? Hello?\n\n- But it's not a one-time benefit, regulatory credits are only going to ***increase*** in the future:\n - EU: even the current EU regulations will generate more ZEV income for Tesla in 2021, but the EU has a pending change in their regulations that will drastically increase the ZEV income in 2021 and further years.\n - US: Under the Biden administration, which looks like an increasingly likely outcome, the EPA will be led by people concerned about the environment again, and ZEV regulations will have teeth and a real market again. Next year Tesla has some sweet, sweet US ZEV credits up for sale, for other US carmakers with not enough EV sales ... Then I haven't even included elements of the Green New Deal that will probably be enacted as well, benefiting EV sales.\n- Tariffs, taxes and tax credits are all part of the common regulatory environment all businesses are exposed to, and related expenses and benefits are captured in GAAP income, as they should. Why should ZEV credits somehow not be counted as real, while other elements of the regulatory environment are? For example Tesla pays a 10% gross import tax on every Model 3 imported to the EU right now. Is TSLAQ arguing that those regulatory tariff expenses are somehow not real, and that Tesla should increase their income statements by several hundred million dollars? Didn't think so ...\n- It's particularly dissonant that TSLAQ complains about *Tesla* receiving regulatory benefits - while **credits are available to every carmaker, they are making heavy use of them and the rest of the car industry received tens of billions of dollars worth of regulatory credits in the EU alone this year**. Where's their fake outrage about VW, Daimler, PGA or BMW regulatory credits in excess of 30 billion dollars? Do they mark all those companies as wildly unprofitable as a result?
