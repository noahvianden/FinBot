The country is estimated to account for 35 to 45 per cent of global demand for the iPhone 12 Pro, according to a recent report from TF Securities International analyst Kuo Ming-Chi, who is known for his Apple analysis. There were between 7 million and 9 million pre-orders of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro globally during the first weekend of sales, according to Kuo.\n\nThe new iPhones have also proven to be a hot commodity on Chinese e-commerce sites. The available stock on JD.com sold out within 30 seconds after pre-orders started on October 16. And Alibaba, the parent company of the South China Morning Post, said that about 30 million users have searched for the new iPhones over the last 30 days on its Tmall marketplace. That is twice the search volume for the iPhone 11 in the same period last year.\n\nSales of the iPhone 12 could be aided by the fact that it is the first iPhone to support 5G after Apple skipped the feature last year. Sales of the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro reached an estimated 1.7 to 2 million units globally in the first 24 hours of pre-orders. The three iPhone 11 models only saw 500,000 to 800,000 units sold in the same period after pre-orders opened in September last year, according to the report from Kuo.\n\niphone demand in China is still strong, initial preorder data indicate that Apple will be gaining back more share in China.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, October 23, 2020. Please enjoy", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket - Friday, October 23, 2020**\n\nStocks once again traded very choppily, with the market pulling back before reversing intraday to finish mixed. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments around stimulus talks, rising coronavirus infections, and the final presidential debate last night. \n\nThe S&P 500 (SPY) performed the best today, finishing the day 0.29% up. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.2%, and the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell a modest 0.11%.\n\nIt appears almost certain that there will not be additional stimulus before the November election, a mere eleven days away. House Speaker Pelosi still thinks it’s possible for a bill to pass before the election, but says it’s up to President Trump. She said, “We put pen to paper… we are writing the bill, and hopefully we will be able to resolve it… we could do that before the election if the president wants to.” Any additional stimulus will likely include a new round of checks and more money for unemployment benefits, schools, state, and local governments. \n\nThis morning, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Bloomberg TV that “the ball’s not really moving much right now” in discussions, and that he “doesn’t want to make any predictions about the timing of an agreement.”\n\nUnfortunately, in the US, around 71,600 new cases were recorded yesterday, according to data from John Hopkins. According to CBS News that is the fourth-highest number of new infections reported in the country since the pandemic began and the highest number reported since July. During the debate candidate Joe Biden warned of a “dark winter coming” and once again urged the public to wear masks and follow federal social distancing guidelines. President Trump, on the other hand, incorrectly claimed that the virus was “going away” and that the US is “rounding the corner.” These statements were meant with severe criticism from health officials and are simply not true from a number’s perspective, the country is averaging more than 50,000 new infections a day and it appears to be climbing.\n\nIn Europe, governments and health officials are scrambling to deal with a surge of infections across the continent, with many fearing a second wave. Millions across Europe are now facing tougher coronavirus restrictions. Italy, France, Spain, Germany and elsewhere are introducing curfews in large regions of the country in a bid to stem the recent spike in cases. In England, the government has imposed restrictions in the capital of London and in cities in the Northern parts of the country.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Intel (INTC) sold off more than 10% after the company unexpectedly posted a quarterly decline in data center chip sales, driven by a near-halving of revenue from enterprise and government clients during the pandemic.\n* Today, remdesivir, Gilead’s (GILD) antiviral treatment, became the first drug to receive formal approval by the FDA to treat Covid-19. The drug was used as part of President Trump’s treatment after his diagnosis earlier this month.\n* Tesla (TSLA) plans to recall more than 29,000 of its Model S and Model X vehicles from China after problems with the cars' front and rear suspension were discovered.\n* Wells Fargo (WFC) is reportedly planning to sell its asset management business for around $3 billion.\n* AstraZeneca (AZN) reported that its COVID-19 vaccine trial will resume in the U.S. The Phase 3 clinical trial for the vaccine candidate that the company is developing with the University of Oxford was placed on hold in multiple countries over concern about an unexplained illness. The trial has already been restarted in the U.K.\n* Remark Holdings (MARK) jumped 39% in late-afternoon trading on Friday after the company tweeted that for the first time, the company is selling its technologies in partnership with Intel (INTC)\n* Joe Biden's remarks Thursday that he would seek to phase out oil stoked concerns among some oil and gas executives that a Democratic administration would further weigh down an industry hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.     \n* Salesforce.com (CRM) had a price target raised by Barclays from $264 to $315 at OVERWEIGHT. The stock is at $250 so implies a 25% upside! Very bullish call\n* Datadog (DDOG) had a price target raised by Barclays from $126 to $136 at OVERWEIGHT. Stock is at $102 so a 33% upside implied.\n* Discover Financial Services (DFS) had a price target raised by Deutsche Bank from $55 to $74 at HOLD, by Royal Bank of Canada from $61 to $75 at OUTPERFORM, and by BMO Capital from $76 to $80 at OUTPERFORM.\n* Danaher (DHR) had a price target raisraisede by Royal Bank of Canada from $250 to $273 at OUTPERFORM, and by Robert W. Baird from $205 to $252 at OUTPERFORM\n* Southwest Airlines (LUV) received some love today from analysts. The following raised price targets: Raymond James from $45 to $49 at STRONG BUY, Credit Suisse from $46 to $51 at OUTPERFORM, Cowen from $43 to $46 at OUTPERFORM, UBS Group from $48 to $52, and Morgan Stanley the most bullish from $56 to $59 at OVERWEIGHT. This chart looks so good! Believe there's an opportunity here.\n* Service Now (NOW) received a price target raised from $465 to $560 and from POSITIVE to OUTPERFORM. We really like this one, and its chart currently!\n* Microsoft (MSFT) received a price target raise from Barclays from $234 to $249 at OVERWEIGHT. We like this one.\n* The Boston Beer (SAM) has been nothing short of spectacular this year! Had a price target raised by Deutsche Bank from $835 to $996 at HOLD, and Smith Barney Citigroup raised target from $1,015 to $1,150. This is a crazy one as analysts can't seem to keep up with the stock!\n* Slack Technologies (WORK) received a price target raise from Barclays from $31 to $36 at OVERWEIGHT.

Everyone knows the stock market (S&P 500) has returned 10% a year before inflation with dividends reinvested, over the last 40 years or so. I'm 21 now, and looking to start building a portfolio. I missed the covid crash, I didn't really have the funds to build a position but in the next year or two am hoping to. My main concern is this pre conceived notion that if you wait long enough, stocks always go up. However, looking at other markets, such as the Japanese market that still has an all time high set in 1989, and the chinese market which still hasn't got back to 2008 levels I am concerned that US stocks might not do the same they've done for the last 40 years. If you were to give the S&P the same 7% before inflation gains it's had (excluding dividends here), you'd be looking at a price of 50,000 in the year 2060, which looks absolutely crazy to me. Other factors which fuel my worries are the fact population growth will slow, so economic growth will stagnate. Debt has also never been higher and if interest rates ever go up, tens of thousands of companies would likely be out of the game forever.

{"title": "CRSR DD FOR DUMMIES", "selftext": "Okay so its Friday and your account is red because you're a retard that keeps buying calls on overpriced megacap tech. Listen up cuckboy tech is good, megacap is bad. We're going into another wave, and tech is going to continue to moon. As institutional investors pull money from these megacaps to further diversify into small cap tech, you'll keep getting fucked by red dildos. Now the good thing is that even though we're retards, we're not boomers. There's still hope for you to get your wife back. First DD so excuse shit grammar and formatting, I'm a retard.\n\n1. LOGI - On recent quarterly report 10/20/20 showed sales rocketed 75% boost. Siting keyboards and combo products climbed 44% and 26% sales growth respectively. Which caused the stock to roar 16% representing about a 1.3b market cap increase. \n\n2. Analysts - Goldman Sachs has it as a buy with a target of 32. And all these other shit boomer banks have it at $24 with a buy rating. They all see the same shit you would see if you just stopped being such an autist. The future is stay at home work, E sports, gaming and streaming. WHICH IS WHAT CRSR FOCUSES ON AND DOMINATES. Which brings me to my next point.\n\n3. Gaming, Esports and Streaming - This year is the console wars, with people saying that this technological leap will be the first of its time. Where Consoles are going to dick pcs for the first time. You already see Microsoft dumping cold hard cash on trying to finally have an exclusive library again besides HaLo and buying out Bethesda for an extreme premium. Wake up people, as newcomers enter the gaming world and OG's look to upgrade their accessories, CRSR will be in the position to ride the wave. \n\n4. Market Float & IPOs - The reason why some fucktards got burned on these recent IPOs is because they don't realize how float can shit on the price of a stock. Usually when these IPOs come out, its a bait for retail investors to gobble up the market shares. While the institutions dump those same stocks on your head. Their float is sitting at 6% while other IPOs like RKT that loves to be pumped here, have a float of 23%.\n\n5. Market Cap - Logitech sitting at 22.31b and CRSR is sitting at 2.3b, what does this mean? In a recent interview the CEO mentioned how they've noticed a strong trend of why and when new customers enter their market/gaming world. When a good game comes out, when new hardware gets released, and when they stay home/work from home. Guess what retards - all 3 are relevant. Huge growth numbers are coming, the same way they crushed their first quarter, they'll crush it again this one. And because the market cap is 2.3b, there's not a ton of float, and institutional investors are interested it means that little Itty bitty 25/share will explode with so much room to run. \n\n6. Esports, AMD & NVIDIA and PC building-  This year we have new releases in the graphics card that are so ridiculously superior from the last model, people are buying them at 10x 15x price on 3rd party sell websites like eBay. The demand for these are through the roof and its safe to assume that people will upgrade and future proof their system with ram cards, coolers and other essential parts that CRSR sells. They'll also pick up new peripherals and add streaming gear as the new streaming trend continues to show good signs. \n\n7. Strong Price Support & How to play - Lets look at the TeChNiCaLs and no Stonks only go up bullshit. Have you looked at the nasdaq, I thought I was fucking colorblind and only saw red until I took my eyes off of that hot garbage. This one tends to run up premarket and aftermarket a good sign of big boys playing. But it also means the buying opportunity for us little guppies is mid day when there's a dip or small pullback. What I love about this movement is, you'll get a 5-10% rally in the premarket but only cool down 2-3%. And then it'll trade sideways as every drop gets caught. On every nasdaq red day, crsr has been as green as the cash in my account. The strength of this stock reminds me of your wife's boyfriend. I posted about it yday but I'll say it again, on red days, look for the green retard strength stocks.\n\nI'm pretty sure at this point your little brains are about to have an aneurysm so I'll save you the trouble. Don't be a beta bitch and finally make some money. CRSR is in a great position, at a great entry point, and has a lot more room to grow. \n\nPositions: CRSR $30 11/20\n\nEDIT: corrected position, had 11/30, fixed.", "id": "jgqu6f", "created_utc": 1603471711.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is the unemployment line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "$FVAC DD - EV/China Tension play", "selftext": "Okay retards this is a long one but it is sure to be a big enough winner to get you out of your wife's boyfriend's basement so wipe your drool off your chin and take a seat and read. All links to sources are attached\n\n$FVAC is a play all WSB can get behind bringing together all our favorite buzzwords (SPAC, EV, WIND, SOLAR) and is a great way to play them all without picking a winner. The SPAC is headed by Chamath Palihapitiya, a early facebook exec, the creator of Social Capital which brought $SPCE public and was an early investor in $PLTR $WORK $BOX and many others. They are taking over the MP Materials (mpmaterials.com) mine in the Mojave Desert where they are the only operating North American Rare Earth Element (REE) mine and 1 of 2 operating outside of chine (The other being Lynas in Australia). There they have high grade REE ore and mine 15% of the worlds supply. Their merger has been agreed to and will change to $MP once the merger is complete which is expected to complete in Q4 2020 (source:[https://finance.yahoo.com/video/processing-rare-earth-materials-us-130250763.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/processing-rare-earth-materials-us-130250763.html))\n\n**What are Rare Earth Elements (REE)?**  \nThese are a collection of rare elements each with unique magnetic, electrochemical, and other qualities that allow them to have special qualities in the future of technology. 80% of the world's supply is produced by China essentially giving them monopoly control over the global market. Pretty much all future of tech has REE's in them, with the largest growth coming from Electric Vehicle motors. These metals go into EV's, phones, televisions, computer chips, generators, wind farms, solar panels, batteries, all electric motors and are sure to have many applications in further new tech such as space and more . Here is the graph of expected demand for the global market for NdPr magnets, which are the magnets used in electric motors and generators, this is just one product that is mined at MP Materials:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Source: https:\\/\\/helbornefinance.com\\/mp-materials-why-complain-about-clean-energy\\/](https://preview.redd.it/ft908hkdnwu51.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfa9967d493697e7d31784ade8aac34c9ee48299)\n\nBut another big reason why this stuff matters is because of its defense technology applications. You can't build any piece of high tech military hardware without boat loads of this stuff. A single F-35 uses around 920 lbs of rare earth metals as calculated by the Pentagon ([https://www.army.mil/article/227715/an\\_elemental\\_issue](https://www.army.mil/article/227715/an_elemental_issue))\n\nand these metals are needed for virtually every other piece of \"smart\" equipment as shown by MP Materials here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[source: https:\\/\\/mpmaterials.com\\/what-we-do\\/#what-we-power](https://preview.redd.it/zfbn6tvenwu51.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=636cd2480b9f7a6f92ea265f1fb1f76decaeaf01)\n\nThis is a big deal but we will come back to it later.\n\n**What is this mine's deal?**\n\nThe MP Materials mine is the old Molybdenum Mine which was bought out of bankruptcy for $20 million by some Private Equity douchebags. It now is a debt-free, profitable company that has agreed to the merger with $FVAC in order to raise capital to build the refining machinery to refine the ore on site. As of right now all the rare earth in the world is processed in china due to them having a monopoly on the global REE market. China controls 80% of the worlds supply of rare earth metals and refines all ore with the exception of Lynas mine in australia who refine their ore in Malaysia. MP Materials is expecting to bring their entire supply chain to be on site and go \"Mine to Magnet\" by 2023. This is with the goal of making the US rare earth independent so we are less reliant on china to keep exports up. Which leads me to a question:\n\n**This sounds boring, how can is this gonna get me rich quick? Answer: Geopolitics**\n\nThe US Government understands the political leverage of China being able to disrupt trillions of dollars of economic production in the US coming to a halt in a very short period of time. China has flexed their muscles in this are before, take a look at the 2010 incident in which a Chinese fishing boat rammed a Japanese Navy boat in the disputed South China Sea and Japan subsequently decided to hold the Chinese fishing boat captain on trial in Japan. One of the responses to this from china was to lower exports of REE's and caused havoc in the market. The price of REE's shot up, with NdPr going up over 400%, shown here. Also note the predicted price in the future as demand increases and supply can't scale up in time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[source: https:\\/\\/helbornefinance.com\\/mp-materials-why-complain-about-clean-energy\\/](https://preview.redd.it/ngoojuihnwu51.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=6437cde3f1fccd81cca5befaad5ea7b536335584)\n\nChina understands that their market dominance in REE's is just as high now as it was back then. As tensions with the US heat up they are more likely to use it again, and they have hinted at this. As I'm sure you've seen on the news and read about how tensions with the US and china have gotten higher economically, politically, and militarily. Lately the US has agreed to selling weapons to Taiwan, which China openly says they are going to invade and retake. In addition, the US banned the sale of Huawei computer chips in the US due to national security risks, it is worth noting that computer chips and semiconductors are made with REE's. This has caused an increase in rhetoric from china including them looking into restricting certain exports due to \"National Security Reasons\" (source: [https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/US-China-tensions/China-readies-new-law-to-ban-companies-on-national-security-grounds](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/US-China-tensions/China-readies-new-law-to-ban-companies-on-national-security-grounds)) Note a very important line from this article:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[source: https:\\/\\/asia.nikkei.com\\/Politics\\/International-relations\\/US-China-tensions\\/China-readies-new-law-to-ban-companies-on-national-security-grounds](https://preview.redd.it/x59r63qknwu51.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&s=491f7a1a96f9a4477f0da39be8dbfb7e03291d84)\n\nHowever the US Government isn't dumb and understands this and is desperately trying to get their REE production capability up so we are less reliant on China. Literally every single part of the executive and legislative branches have given support for government assistance in growing this sector. As of posting this there are 2 bipartisan bills waiting to be voted on in congress that provide incentives to increasing rare earth metal production in the US (source: [https://www.mining-technology.com/news/us-lawmakers-reduce-dependence-rare-earths/](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/us-lawmakers-reduce-dependence-rare-earths/)) , the last republic stimulus bill had a section on promoting \"Critical Mineral Production\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vxwy0cywnwu51.jpg?width=752&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6ab1beea5bc61bd8248a5b9d3213512e87db2839\n\n, Trump has signed an executive order looking into using the Defense Production Act on REE's ([https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2020/10/01/trump-executive-order-on-rare-earths-puts-material-risk-in-spotlight/](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2020/10/01/trump-executive-order-on-rare-earths-puts-material-risk-in-spotlight/)) with the most important part being:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kji2bdjpnwu51.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=5596dfe6e07b7f7846ff69c365a090ce6beaf88b\n\n[source: https:\\/\\/www.defensenews.com\\/congress\\/2020\\/10\\/01\\/trump-executive-order-on-rare-earths-puts-material-risk-in-spotlight\\/](https://preview.redd.it/ptizvf8tnwu51.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=d85c2da843e0e8a9c08888a844533bc920e435ac)\n\nand Lastly, today the last part voiced support by Joe Biden announced today he supports increasing mining REE's even though his political agenda is against the mining sector (source: [https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-mining/exclusive-biden-campaign-tells-miners-it-supports-domestic-production-of-ev-metals-idUSKBN27808B](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-mining/exclusive-biden-campaign-tells-miners-it-supports-domestic-production-of-ev-metals-idUSKBN27808B)). In addition, the Pentagon is getting desperate too and has given both MP Materials and Lynas (Australian company) funding/grants in order to increase production in the western world (source: [https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/03/pentagon-rare-earth-minerals-china-390939](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/03/pentagon-rare-earth-minerals-china-390939)). All facets of government understand the importance of this mine and are shelling out money to it so it can expand the domestic supply chain.\n\nBecause it is the only operating REE mine in the US all of this future legislation can only benefit one company, and it is $FVAC. The government at all facets have decided to shell out cash to ensure that this company both grows and is profitable - and we can all profit in the meantime. Mining and refining these metals and all metals/minerals in general is very expensive as it is an extremely capital intensive process due to huge machinery needed to make it profitable in large volumes and expensive to operate. In addition, I have work experience in the past as a process engineer in mineral refining and can vouch that all the red tape and paperwork necessary to design/build/operate makes the timescale take years to begin operation at an industrial scale. This makes this mine years, probably a whole decade, in front of possible domestic competition as they will begin to benefit from any assistance immediately and won't have to wait decades to reach profitability because it is already there.\n\n**OKAY, but how do I play this?**\n\nWhile i do own shares in the company as I believe in them long term, I think we can all agree that options are the best way to play this. I think the best way to play this is with ITM LEAPs so that you can increase leverage on large returns while being ITM so you don't have to risk losing it all. I see 3 huge catalysts as possible in the near future that would catapult this stock to the moon and a few others worth watching:  \n**1) Merger completes**\n\nSPAC's have a tendency to go parabolic upon closing their mergers, I think once this merger completes and more news is out there about this stock that it will backflip and shoot straight for the moon as people read \"EV\" in relation to it. The merger is agreed to, the CEO in the interview linked above mentions this again, and is scheduled to close in Q4 2020 (predicted Nov 10 from SPAC filing, but is never mentioned explicitly). Remember the 100% day $NKLA had even though who knows if that's even a real product and many other ridiculous future technology/EV companies have done.\n\n**2) Further assistance by US Government**\n\nIf Donny Pump decides he wants to say fuck China again as the trade war heats up and China and the US spar geopolitically and funds REE production in the US then MP Materials will for sure benefit and the stock price will reflect this influx of funds. There is no question about this one in the long run, literally every part of the government that can help fund this and voice support for this is working on it as posted above. The US Government will ensure that this company stays healthy because it NEEDS this company.\n\n**3) China restricts exports**\n\nAs I mentioned above, China has restricted exports before and has said they are looking into doing it again. This would probably start by restricting REE's going toward US Defense contractors related to selling equipment to Taiwan and possibly expanding that to more US Defense contractors as well. That the scenario they have essentially laid out from clues from their rhetoric, and could expand further. They could jab the US back after we banned huawei chips by lowering exports on REE's that go into semiconductors, which would cause the price of US chips to go up and decrease production. China could do any mixture of these whenever they want to pressure the US into acting how they want.\n\n**Honorable mention catalyst**\n\nBecause NdPr magnets are necessary in EV production, once this company goes mine to magnet on site they could use Chamath's connections to Elon Musk and sign a contract to supply Tesla's magnets by them. Kind of a stretch, but take a look at the Nickel and Lithium miners that TSLA signed a contract with.\n\n**TLDR:** EV grow big, china bad, $FVAC (soon to be $MP) is a US-Gov backed monopoly, buy LEAPS\n\n**Disclaimer:** I am holding shares and 3/19/2021 $10 Call\n\nEDIT: China today (10/26) announces sanctions on Lockheed Martin & Raytheon over sales to Taiwan. They haven’t announced exactly what that means but they said earlier about the law that REE’s were on the table.
