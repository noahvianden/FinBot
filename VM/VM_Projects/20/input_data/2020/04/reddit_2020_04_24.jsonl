{"title": "Hooray! A return to our (Tea) Roots! Large scale indicators and the debt cycle.", "selftext": "Previous post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6dw3s/something\\_something\\_tea\\_leaves\\_did\\_you\\_see\\_that/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6dw3s/something_something_tea_leaves_did_you_see_that/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, today was fun. Predictable, but fun! Lets start with what we got wrong, so that cynics feel vindicated:\n\nThe stonks did not go down. (but they did go red, -.01 or -100, a win is a win!)\n\nNow, while we didn't say that they were guaranteed to go down (because we don't make guarantees) , we were feeling like it was more likely than up. Luckily for us, our general conservative outlook put us in a great place to be slightly off today. This is EXACTLY why you hedge for a bit of caution by the way, so you can afford to be (safely) wrong. That said, we did specifically caution against false 'start' signals, which yesterday felt like to me. Today, that proved to be invaluable. Look at all those posts from people saying \"I lost money either way\", \"it was all over the place\", \"this market makes no sense\". Well, it did to us, if you were following along so far. I likened it to the kid that was about to jump off the cliff into the water, but has 2nd thoughts at the end and teeter-tottered. A shove certainly sends us downward, but I'm not sure what that shove might be. Instead, I think our most likely case will be a bit of fidgeting, before jumping anyways.\n\nWe should continue to be READY for the jump, straddles continue to be a great play and you should have cashed on some good straddle today. I did not, because I was lazy and didn't get up early enough before work to get some in today. Oh well.\n\nWe should not, however, bank on the fall being tomorrow. Truth be told, I expect the post market to to maybe recover a token amount  of our losses from today, not counting any strange gaps.\n\nLets take a moment and talk about why indicators often work, so we can agree on what we want to get out of them.\n\nThe universe is a giant ball of millions of patterns forming tons of bullshit. This is such an abstract statement, that it almost seems useless. But it gives us a foundation. We know that water is H2O, right? A simple pattern that repeats itself constantly in the universe. One thing that Fundamentalists in the market like to decry is that Technical patterns aren't guarantees, and you'll be the one to lose big. That's true, and that's exactly where risk management comes in, our 'this is not the droid you're looking for' mechanic.\n\nBut diicembr! You said Tea leaves were garbage! You're a flip-flopping piece-of-shit karma-farmer! What I specifically said is that the farther away from smaller time frames you get, the less likely a  indicator is to work for any small move. Easy example? Try using the 5 year moving average to trade the 1-minute chart. Now try making 1 trade per year using 15-second chart. You have to give the indicators proper space to work.\n\nNow for a shitty language trick: Fundamentals ARE technical analysis. There is no such thing as trading purely \"fundamentals\". TA's are just math formulas, right? Well Fundamentals is just plugging numbers into those formulas. A + B = C gets a lot easier when you know what A and B equal, which is really just the research that \"fundamentalists\" use to differentiate themselves. They're basically TA'ing the TA. Well, the same concept can be fundamentally applied to using multiple indicators. Today we're going to use a large scale chart (months, circa 2008) to look at the 2008 recession and define what those candles actually mean. You'll notice a lot of similar steps happen in the fall there. Are those fundamentals? Or are there a few patterns forming in there? Or both?\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/kRftdgv.png](https://i.imgur.com/kRftdgv.png)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I'm going to overlay some indicators on there. I like the Cycle Channel Oscillator, Bollinger Bands, and ATR (2.5atr) trailing stoploss. Why do I like these?\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/Dwzps96.png](https://i.imgur.com/Dwzps96.png)\n\nCycle Channel Oscillator\n\nThis oscillator will tell you when you've strayed too far out of a cycle, and tells you when you owe debts. By creating 4 zones you can see this illustrated:\n\n1. Excessive spending, ballooning debt. Entirely unsustainable, recession of spending incoming. You'll owe time in zone 3 at a 2-1 ratio typically.\n2. High spending, fast moving economy, debt-incurring. If debt isn't payed down, you'll go to zone 1.\n3. Low spending, smaller creation of debt. If spending is reduced too far, go to zone 4. If spending increases, creating more debt, but increasing the speed of the economy, go to zone 2.\n4. Debt servicing is too high and creates excess capital, pulling you into zone 2. Going from zone 4 to zone 3 historically creates things like the industrial revolution, the renaissance(s), etc.\n\nOne way to look at it, is that zones 1 and 3, 2 and 4, and 2 and 3 are linked in pairs. Too much time in any zone will cause a shift to the appropriate zone after a travel period. Using the zone oscillator, we can see that prior to the burst, the housing market was clearly building more debt, and ended up deep in zone 1. After the unsustainable level fell away, we proceeded pretty cleanly down to Zone 2, had too much debt to sustain and fell to zone 3. A couple attempts to satisfy that debt level were unsuccessful, and we fell to zone 4. We spent about a year recovering to neutral (between zones 2/3). We also note we were in zone 4 for about 1/2 the time we were in zone 1. This 2/1 pattern repeats itself frequently. Ever been told you should get about 8 hours of sleep? 16 awake/8 asleep. Capital..Debt... Hrm. Does this sound like bullshit? Sure. Should we ignore it? No, we should be skeptical and use more indicators to check for correlation.\n\nBollinger Bands\n\nBollinger bands are very similar to the cycle channel, but they also show volatility with the widening channels. Something to keep in mind, is that just because the market is volatile, doesn't mean it will actually move out of alignment at end of the day/cycle. Today was a great example, all that movement and we went -.01c. Bollinger bands are great for realizing when you're in a climbing 'high' cycle, versus a climbing 'low' cycle. Why is that useful? A climbling 'low' cycle is called a mean-reversion, or a 'dead cat bounce'. It doesn't leave the 'dead cat' moniker until it crosses that center line. Is it possible that your dead-cat will convert to be a straight vertical \"v shaped recovery\" climb? Absolutely, but it is as likely? Nope.\n\nThe ATR Trailing stoploss.\n\nIgnore the Buy/Sell names for a moment, and imagine they say \"Bull/Bear Market\". You will frequently be off with this chart by 2.5 times the ATR, but by using this value, it helps lessen the number of \"false starts\" the new markets have. This in general tells you when you need to stop holding a long or short and reverse your position. If you look at our picture, it tells us that there was a flip-flopping of the markets in 2008 as the fed kept throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what stuck. Ultimately, it didn't keep the market from falling, but we did see that we were told to switch to the bear market stance about 3 months after we started climbing. Why 3 months? That is our \"2.5 ATR\" value. We know it won't nail the bottoms or tops perfectly, but we're a lot more concerned with jumping into the wrong market. A smaller value (from 2.5) will work better in choppy environments, but will also require more direct intervention from you to manage, and you'll need thick skin for the increase in flip flops. After all, was today a Bull market? Or a Bear? This indicator will tell you bear, since it ended negative. Without context, this one can drop you out early or late. Combined with bands and cycles, it gives you a great idea of when the trend you're in is ending.\n\nNow lets look at a bigger timeline.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/obURwzi.png](https://i.imgur.com/obURwzi.png)\n\nWe can see that pretty much from 2010.5-Feb 2020 we're operating in a zone 2 phase with 2 zone 1 jumps. We know (per our thesis) this whole time we've been building debt. We also know that no one ever payed the debt for those two Zone 1 jumps in 2013/5 and 2017/18. We also know that some other investors noted that some investors (like Buffet) have been saying that the market was over inflated and nothing was 'a good buy'. We've been building our economy on aggressive debt for 10 years, and thus the rapid expansion and 'wealth vehicle' creation has boomed. Your Grant Cardones and the like have used aggressively low interest rates to over-leverage their empires on the promises that they'll pay the debt down later. Well, look at that timeline. Look at those red bars in 2020. They're huge. They dwarf the 2008 numbers. If I were using just this indicator, I'd think we were about to enter a big ass debt paydown period. If we don't, if we somehow skip the zone 4 timeout like we did the last 2 times, I can only imagine the next time will be even more catastrophic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUsing  ATR stoploss, you night notice that little blip in 2018.5.\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/21/investing/oil-prices-trump-saudi-arabia/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/21/investing/oil-prices-trump-saudi-arabia/index.html)\n\nWe see that Oil prices crashing all by themselves can bring about a recession. Now, given it was a single point of failure, the recovery was reasonably quick, even if the effect was deep. We've got failures in the economy, oil, food is starting to be worthless to farmers and scarce to consumers.\n\nHere is the 1929 crash, with the same chart indicators:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/tqW5eNR.png](https://i.imgur.com/tqW5eNR.png)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNotice how long they spend in zone 3/4 on the backside of the crash, after that giant zone 1/2 climb. Bollinger bands show the same. I find that by comparing indicators to known values in the crash of 08, and looking at current events, and comparing the indicators of the 3 charts, you can get some pretty similar chart/expectations. There is a definite lifecycle of the debt model, and I think we're just starting the down leg to ours.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat does that mean going foward? Straddles for safety, and stoploss puts when I'm feeling strongly we might have started. Also, leaning into positions if things seem good. What does this mean? Doubling down on shares mid-way through a bar. Start the pattern at 1 contract, breaks your target, double to 2, keeps moving, double to 4, 8, etc, till you're at your max comfort. What I don't do, is unload the same way. Take every cut when the ATR stoploss says the market has shifted. If i'm wrong, I'm still richer, even if money is on the table. If I'm right, I'm still richer. Notice both paths lead to being richer. And If I'm wrong early? I'm safe on minimal invested risk. Live to ride another day, and remember, this is a 2 way ride. You want to have money at the bottom to invest in the climb. It'll be slower, but you could be set for life, if you can manage your way down without breaking your (bank) neck. Happy hunting autists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I forgot something neat I wanted to share. Remember when we talked about those mysterious late night / early morning gaps? Well, We've seen on our larger charts how there is a bit of a borrow/payback cycle to them. Check out this:\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/rhCC6tR.png](https://i.imgur.com/rhCC6tR.png)\n\nZero payback. The Gaps just tax the crap out of our cycles, completely unsustainable, and we never see a 'debt' phase 3/4 like we do in known natural models. I think it adds more correlation to the notion that these are 100% blatant market manipulations. I'd be curious, in fact, if they line up (time of day)  with when the fed buys the bonds from the market place for the first time in the morning, or last time in the evening.\n\nAlso notice the frequency that the spikes happen in the off-hours, as opposed to the market hours. There is more than coincidence there, in my opinion. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "g6y9be", "created_utc": 1587687447.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Wow absolutely unbelievable.

Tracking the trajectory of new cases, we’ll likely be out to July before the economy starts humming again but things could hit the fan again in the Fall in some areas that did not contain the virus.\n\nHere’s what is going to bring Spy back down to earth: guidance. We’re already seeing stocks like Netflix and Intel fall after beating expectations because of expectations they are screwed long term. Stocks like Amazon, Microsoft, etc. could all moon based on an expected Q1 earnings beat but could fall after earnings if guidance indicates trouble and slowdowns in Q2 and later in the year.\n\nCertain businesses benefited from surge buying early in this crisis but could get crushed later on due to reduced spending in the economy. Stocks like Facebook and Google will obviously get destroyed but that’s largely because of businesses instantly cutting ad spending overnight at the first sign of trouble. Stocks like Amazon, Microsoft, etc. may not experience a slowdown in Q1 but could see major earnings misses in Q2 and Q3 or reduced expectations based on guidance.\n\nThen there’s the rest of the S&P500. Some medical stocks may do very well but the majority will get crushed due to the global slowdown.\n\nThis will take time to play out. The guidance will come warning investors of a major slowdown but many investors won’t know when to sell and will watch a slow bleed as they slowly get frustrated and finally dump their stocks. This will ride out until the algorithms hit their Fibonacci bullshit numbers and trigger buy signals to send it mooning back up.

{"title": "The Tea leaves are more irrational today than yesterday, and also they are doing nothing, and my tendies are getting eaten. How to make money when the day is doing nothing.", "selftext": "Previous post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6y9be/hooray\\_a\\_return\\_to\\_our\\_tea\\_roots\\_large\\_scale/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g6y9be/hooray_a_return_to_our_tea_roots_large_scale/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, today was a pretty light volume day. 84M on SPY by EOD. The daily thread was chock full of \"losing money doing nothing\" type comments, so I thought we'd spend some time on how to make money when your options are decaying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLets start with the basics:\n\nIf you start a day with 5 puts for $220 SPY. You notice that the day doesn't seem to be doing much of anything. The closer you are to the date of your options expiry date, the more Theta decay will affect them. An excellent question to pose to yourself:\n\nIf I didn't already have the position I'm in, would I buy based the same setup right now based on current information, current price, and current projection? If the answer to ANY of those is no, then sell. You can rebuy the SAME POSITION end of day if you want back in, and you'll prolly save money (unless your brokerage charges for options, in which case you'll have to measure it).\n\nMy example hypothesis:\n\nTommorow will be bigly red. I buy puts with an expiry of 4 days out, so that I have time to unload my position if it doesn't work out.\n\nTomorrow comes, and the day is a stall 1 hour into it. Well, the most volatile hours of the day are the first and the last, and not much happened. I surmise that today will actually be a nothing day, but tomorrow is a blood red day for sure. What do I do at 10:30am? I close the position. If my theory is still my theory at 3/3:30, I won't have spent all day paying for decay just to be the one hanging on to the option.\n\nHow could this fuck me? Well, if you saw a massive increase in volatility, than buying it back is going to be more expensive. On the other hand, if volatility is going crazy, its much more likely that something will actually happen, so theres that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you know that holding options all day makes them decrease in value, you have to ask yourself something basic. Who profits when options decay? The seller. Now they have an asset to cover that isn't worth as much as they got for it. The difference between the cover and the sell prices are your profit. It is theoretically capped, as a stock (so far!) can't go below $0.\n\nNow lets talk about how you make profits off options strategies, the straddle and the strangle.\n\nThe Long straddle.\n\nThe long straddle makes money when the underlying stock moves in a direction. The more it moves, the more you make. You don't have to know which direction its moving, but it needs to move. You lose money on a straddle to decay just like everyone else. 2x the decay(s) actually, so these are not long term holds. If your long straddle doesn't move on a slow day, you'll out the decay of your premium equal to the decay of your theta and delta (time and volatility). You can still make some money back sometimes selling at the EoD, 1530-1600 by selling when the volatility is normally a bit higher. Note: this will rarely MAKE you money on a slow day. This is a strategy that you open by BUYING a call and a put with the same expiration date, and the same strike. \"limitless\" profit, defined maximum loss (the cost of your premiums).\n\nThe Short straddle.\n\nMost things here are the opposite of the long. For starters, lets be clear. Your profit is 100% limited to the cost of the premiums you sold them for. What does that mean? Well, lets make one thing real big and clear. IF A LONG STRADDLE HAS INFINITE PROFIT POTENTIAL, THAN A SHORT HAS INFINITE LOSS POTENTIAL. Short straddles should be a bit more managed because of this fact. If your theory is wrong, you need to get out. How does a short straddle work? Well, you sell a call and a put (still same date, still same price). The buyer holds on to them, and the greek decay starts to eat his premiums. If the market doesn't move in a way to make them profitable, the decrease in premium value goes into the pockets of the person who sold them. How do you play these? The opposite of the long. You buy and hold for decay. If you want to increase your earnings potential with these, you buy while Delta (volatility) is high ,because it will have more 'premium' value to decay. I will warn against this, because if volatility is high, it is much more likely that it could spike away from you, and you could lose a lot of money. If you buy and sell these during low volatility times, you'll make less, but also risk less. If you want to make more money on these, my advice is to scale (open more safe positions rather than taking fewer higher-reward/riskier positions. I also like to close mine at 3pm, because I can avoid end of day volatility, and the risk they might walk away from me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause you want to make money off of movement, or lack of it, I prefer to buy the above strategies when the current market position is at a high-liquid strike price, such as 280, or 275. If you have to buy one that is off-center a bit, realize your profit may be a bit off-center too. In addition, some of the less popular strike prices (282/3 vs 285) generally have less volume, so getting in/out can be more problematic, which could fuck up your gains. These are generally \"pattern\" independent strategies (meaning buy whenever, as long as you're close to what you think the \"center\" time is), as long as the general trend period (Up and down over X time frame) is low. If there is a lot of rapid up-down 3-4 points, like a horizontal zipper, it indicates that there is more volatility, so purchase accordingly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLong Strangle\n\nThe long strangle is similar to the long straddle. What is the primary different? You don't buy identical strike prices for your call/put (still same expiration). So Market position is lets say, 250. You buy a call for 255, and a put for 245, so you have a Range of 10. Because the current market price is 250, and you bought away from the current market price, your premiums will be a little bit cheaper. However, you will have a 'dead zone'. 245 to 255 is no man's land for you, if the underlying doesn't move out of that range, your options will expire worthless. Because of this, the cheaper price, you need a greater movement. The upside is that your gains are still potentially infinite. The downsides are that you have a dead zone, and you're still rocking 2x the amount of decay from theta and delta, so you need the movement to be fast enough to beat the loss to decay. I really never buy this strategy, as I'm not a fan of its extra complications.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShort Strangle\n\nLike the Short straddle, this strategy makes money off of decay. The difference between the long and the short, is that you ONLY profit when the market price exists in the space \"between\" your strike prices, which was previously the only place we DIDN'T make money. The dead-man-zone is the money maker on the short. I think a short strangle can be easier to make modest returns because the dead-zone gives you more flexibility, but your gains will be smaller. One thing to remember, these can have the same inversed \"limitless loss\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing you might ask, how can I reduce my risk from this \"infinite loss\" potentiality? Cover your short by buying 100 shares (per straddle/strangle sold) of the underlying asset when you open the position. This can obviously get expensive, but the maximum risk you have at that point is the cost of your shares. If the strangle's legs expire worthless (because the option didn't move in price, and decay ate away the value until expiry), you still have 100 shares and you can do it again! (if you believe the same theory to remain true). Or, sell the shares for whatever difference in price for a smaller profit/loss.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/ouZ0jdg.png](https://i.imgur.com/ouZ0jdg.png)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo 85m volume today, pretty weak. These minor movements definitely make me think we're getting ready for a big move, and I'd still bet downward. One thing to understand, is that the 2nd legs down are not always as big as the first. We may find some of these attempts to 'fix' things do indeed shorten the length of our next leg down. Really, my hope (except for ma tendies) is that they build a staircase to keep the crash from being too severe. And actually, I think people will make more money in total if there are steps down, because they'll have more opportunity to flip out of bad positions and more opportunity to try and get a slice of the down than if its all over in 1/2 days.\n\n[https://i.imgur.com/HIPu0tN.png](https://i.imgur.com/HIPu0tN.png)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf we look at the above (crash of 29) , we can see the efforts following the big crash bar take MONTHS (each bar is 1 month on that chart) to get to the 2nd crash phase. While some things may happen quicker, we can't be sure. The crash of 29 took 3 bars to crash, and 5 bars to recover (over the dead cat, and on to the 2nd leg of the fall). If we use the same math for the 2020 crash, that it took 5 weeks to crash, it could take 8 weeks (we're currently in week 5, so 3 weeks left) to get to our second leg. The recession in 2016 was 4 bars to crash, 6 to get to the 2nd leg, and the 2007 crash was roughly 22 weeks down, 10 up, to get to the new leg. Though if I'm being honest, 2007 was a wavy messy crash. It had closer to 4 legs down than 1down /deadcat /1down. We may be in store for a few more weeks of this sorta \"maybe?\" slow nothing days like today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, I'll address a topic a few people post about regularly in complaints.\n\nI will likely never post gains and losses porn. I am not interested in feeding the hopes and dreams of the lottery seekers, or making those who have already lost their pots feel bad about their failures. I've had days making decent (but not crazy) gains with straddles, and also days where I lost a bit too.\n\nI spent this morning trading (1) share of spy with some new indicators, on a few different timetables. I made a whopping $1.01 testing some new stuff, but I was profitable in 66% of my trades, which I was happy about.\n\nI hope the information you might take away from my long winded ass posts is useful, and maybe keeps you from an early death. Remember, you need money for the climb. If you make some decent gains before then, that's pretty cool too. Happy hunting autists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ntl:dr Words, More boring words, Magic 8 ball says: Spy 69P 4/24/20", "id": "g7ibxy", "created_utc": 1587768202.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "PSA: short straddles/strangles probably shouldn't be sold on Robinhood especially with high volatility. they are extremely bad at filling options so closing your position will be much harder. good luck.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "This is a great add-on, thanks.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "That’s a lot of words that I can’t read but I see a graph and some numbers so count me in.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Every adventuring group needs a token Dwarf.
