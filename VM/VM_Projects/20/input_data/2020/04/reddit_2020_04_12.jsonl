This is ridiculously high and easy to label as overpriced. However, their earnings are being utilized towards captial investments (growth in their lineup) which is an explanation for a high P/E but not necessarily a \"bad\" stock \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- I am not a big gamer, but from taking a poll of approximately 100 gamers (I know not a lot) the big consensus is that they have high performing products that is significantly cheaper than its competitors (INTEL). This is great for now, but I take this as a subjective measure of potential growth. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- Their financials IMO are not bad. They have a great steady growth, and I have some positions at $10. However, I see a lot of arguments saying their fair value is like $20. What is that? I know what a fair value is, but how are people speculating this value without any backup? I feel like people are throwing a lot of prices of what they think is fair but not giving much information. I can guess they are just seeing the P/E ratio and just cutting the current value of the stock by some mentally established value.\n\n\\- As meme stock as it is, this was the same mindset when this stock was in the low 10ish. Then it shot up like crazy in the last few years. Why? I speculate it is because AMD is strongly based on the growth potential and opinion of the users rather than their financially evaluated value. \n\nAll that said, I see them as speculative growth in the future and customer based. Going off of these indicators, I don't see anything that debases or devalues their speculative growth or their customer base! I feel bullish on AMD. \n\nI am no professional in any capacity. Just calling it from how I see it based on my own research. I'd appreciate constructive input.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclaimer: This would be a part of my fun portfolio (10% of all my holdings is my fun portfoilio and I plan to make AMD 20 percent of that at my next dip opportunity).

If you see Intels roadmap they wont be able to compete up until 2022 when they launch 7nm CPUs. Performance gap will continue grow in AMDs favor. Have you seen reviews of Ryzen Mobile 4000 series APU that was launched last week? Crushes everything Intel has while providing 40-50% battery life. Remember mobile is a stronghold of Intel now AMD is beating them on all 3 fronts: Desktop, Mobile & servers.\n\nThis is what I wrote in other thread. AMD is far more attractive buy vs NVDA.\n\nRough times ahead for NVDA certainly in consumer computing and especially in Laptop space. APUs will start to eat entry level to mid level sales from NVDA. See the trend. AMD Renoir Ryzen 4000 series outclasses NVDA MX250 and comes close to MX350. Intel Tiger Lake coming later this year will be more powerful than Renoir (based off leaks certainly in synthetic benchmarks). Also, there have been numerous rumors of AMD Van Gogh APU and Cezanne Zen 3 APU with RDNA2 architecture. So all in all trend is clear. Much powerful graphics embedded in the CPU. NVDA does not have x86 IP and ARM just cannot take high performance x86 cores soon enough.\n\nOn the HPC space, NVDA is not found in any of the 3 exa flop supercomputer contracts. 2 was awarded to AMD and 1 to Intel (All Cray). Based off current NVDA offering for HPC, one would say they have superior products by far but none of NVDA product was able to make it in those super computers. Reason is simple heterogeneous computing. Based off rumors, Custom Milan (Zen 3) APUs will be installed in one of the supercomputer.\n\nSimilarly, AMD is developing architecture especially for data center HPC/AI workloads that will be placed against HPC volta/Ampere. Before AMD used to have same architecture for both gaming and data cente/AI.\n\nFor now I would say NVDA is doing great on the desktop front but there is a reason for it. AMD does not have high end graphics card to compete against NVDA. Tables will turn once AMD launches RDNA2 GPUs. RDNA2 will have 50% increase in performance per watt and is the same architecture that powers PS5 and Xbox One series X. And we all know How poor NVDAs strategy/ implementation for RTX turned out. Only handful of games featuring RTX even after 1.5years of launch.\n\nI bought NVDA in the $30‚Äôs and AMD in the $3s but sold all NVDA in the $70-80s and went all in to AMD ($6-$7) due to my assumption of higher growth (%). AMD has paid off much higher what NVDA would have. AMD is more diversified. Has both high performance CPU and GPU IP.

{"title": "Hedging truly is for pussies", "selftext": "This a response to the post on the front page suggesting to short volatility while longing VIX calls. Let's be real here. Most of us are not sitting with hundreds of thousands or millions on the plate. We're not trying to make small gains that don't make an impact in your lives. We want money and we want it to be quick. Noone wants to be rich in 30 years when our dicks won't work. If you want to, go ahead, that's great. But I know for a fact that I don't and most people on this sub don't. Otherwise, we wouldn't be here.\n\nContrary to popular belief, hedging using options is only a good strategy for protecting your gains or at best breaking even, and in the off chance, making some safe gains if you end up being wrong. It helps you survive the game sure, and saving your money is key, but that's more optimal for when you're already rich. Most of us aren't rich. Noone has ever 100xed their money shorting or longing a futures contract while longing calls or puts on the other side. It has unironically never happened so stop calling it the best trade.\n\nIf you really want to be safe, you might as well just play a cash and carry strategy your whole life optimizing on large future premiums, but your gains won't be much better than putting all your savings into an account at a bank where you earn small amounts of interest. You can make large gains if you have sophisicated arbitrage bots with quant analysts at your disposal, but again, most of you do not have that.\n\nA better and safer strategy where you can still make tons of gains is to simply use futures to short or long with low leverage based on where you think the market is going in the mid term. Use this for most of your stack and then use options to double down if you have some play money left.\n\nFuck all the pussy shit.", "id": "g03erm", "created_utc": 1586720944.0, "score": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "I believe shitpost would've been the appropriate flair.", "score": 34, "replies": []}, {"body": "There's no such thing as a get rich quick scheme.
