Office in New York City, 1 billion USD under management with an average account size of $6,200. Your responsible investing team has even protected profits during every market dip. \n\nMeanwhile, across the street, a meeting is going on at a big bank. Chad shouts \"I want 57 billion\". The room goes silent. Everyone in the boardroom laughs, including Chad. Chad then snorts a line of coke and gets serious. He says \"give me 285 billion, fill or kill\". The deal gets done immediately. \n\nChad just bought swaps betting that Jim's clients return 30% over the next three years.

He tells him to sell the swaps and that the Fed will provide a market for them. \n\nThat night JPow takes too much Adderall. He accidentally printed an extra 500 billion. He knows that he can't give it to small business wage slaves like Jim’s clients. That will cause inflation. Instead he phones Dimon and tells him to get Wells Fargo to price the swaps.
