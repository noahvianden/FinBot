{"title": "As a trader/investor there are bad days, weeks, months, even quarters.. We rarely have bad years, so please do not get down on yourself", "selftext": "Good evening everyone. I thought it was important to go over this very important topic because I have read a lot about this all over Reddit. Some of the Elite Traders are going thru this. I am front lines with them on a daily basis. I wanted to tell everyone and anyone that it is ok, even the best of us have bad days, weeks, months, quarters....but rarely a year/years. I have been trading since very late 1994 and there is no way I can tell you everything was fine and dandy. The dot com crash of 2000 where I lost 75% off my peak was a true learning experience, and that has never happened again. But yes, I too have bad days, weeks or months. Last year with covid hit I was down about 25%, and that is because I was about 50% cash, had I been all in stocks I would have been down 40-50%...There are alot of lessons learned each time we are down.\n\nIt is fair to measure yourself against an index like the SP500 because since its creation it has been up 8% year over year.. However, if last month you were down, and the SP was up 3% it isnt fair to be down on yourself over this! It is cap weighted index where APPL accounts for nearly 25-30% alone! AAPL accounts for 20 of the Nasdaq 100! I too, was down the last few weeks when the market turned upside down. Give yourself some time before you measure yourself against an index or another trader. Do not be so down on yourself and follow the course.\n\nIf you want to measure yourself and get angry just look at 50% of the Nasdaq 100 that is off 33-50% off their highs.. Most of us trade tech and growth. Great company's always come back to make newer highs especially if they make cash and have earnings. So if your account is down even 50% but you are down on something solid rest assured it will come back 33-50%, Earnings season kicks off this week. And as long as you have something with earnings if the stock has been beaten down, dont fret this is the perfect time for your company to fight for proper valuation. (TCOM, SGEN, WBA, PTON, ZM, PDD) there are many more that are slammed off their highs, PDD is off 55%! If the company is solid think of this as a blip on the map....\n\nIf you are using the market to give you steady income daily, weekly it will be a roller coaster ride. Remember, a stock is a live auction, it rarely tracks the company performance in real time, and momentum/speculation moves stocks faster. That means it is very hard to always be right every single trading day my friends. Do not be so hard on yourself and it is very hard to have a steady flow of income unless you are working with sizeable capital. Dont fret my friends, earnings season is here and most of the stocks I trade have a low PE 20 or so, and they have consistently beat top and bottom line the last few quarters so I await the earnings reports! Please do not be down on yourself just yet.... the earnings reports will give solace!

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, July 12, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, July 12, 2021**\n\nAfter a spurt in volatility last Thursday, stocks have shaken off any jitteriness, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to fresh intraday records today. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for Q2 earnings season to begin tomorrow, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), reporting results and Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress later this week.\n\nWith Q2 earnings are fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be \"need to be revised higher.\" This would represent a sharp acceleration from the 50% year-on-year growth recorded during Q1’s earnings season.\n\nA big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to the year-earlier period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.\n\nGoldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market pariticpants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?\n\nIn addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week’s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, an unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.\n\nKathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the recovery is on track, it’s really just the rate of change that has slowed. We couldn’t continue to grow at 9-10% GDP growth every quarter, so obviously it’s going to slow down. I think one of the things that got into markets that got \\[Treasury\\] yields tumbling was maybe the fact that the Fed was going to hike rates sooner than anticipated. That sends a signal to the long end of the bond market that maybe the Fed isn;t going to tolerate higher inflation for longer and that they’re going to step on the brakes sooner rather than later ... we don't think that's going to be the case though. We think the economy is doing well, yields will probably bounce back.\" I agree with this sentiment. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Over the weekend, Richard Branson became the first civilian to go to space with his own company Virgin Galactic (SPCE), a remarkable milestone as companies like Bezos’ Blue Origin and Musk’s SpaceX intensify competition in space tourism.\n* Despite successfully completing the trip, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) fell more than 10% after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock.\n* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk on Monday defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company. Frankly, this lawsuit seems a little ridiculous to me given SolarCity has proven a smart acquisition.\n* Walt Disney (DIS) said on Sunday that “Black Widow”, the newest Marvel movie, made $80 million in theater sales, the largest domestic opening weekend since “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” in 2019, a strong sign that appetite to go to the movies remains high among Americans. Comparatively, “Black Widow” made $60 million through streaming purchases.\n* In yet another crackdown of big-tech companies, Chinese regulators are reportedly set to order Tencent (TCEHY) to give up their exclusive rights to music labels and pay a small fine.\n* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to by SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion.

None of that has happened, and AMD processors are still only used in budget pre-builds. Microsoft and Sony chose them for consoles because it keeps the cost down. An Intel/Nvidia combo would school anything AMD has currently, and we'd pay for it. Comparing graphics cards, Nvidia near always wins in performance, and AMD wins in price.
