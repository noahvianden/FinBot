I'm pretty shocked at the current market cap. Last year when we had the stock split. I told my friends it would sell off and to buy NIO. I told them this, \"Tesla is more stable but you're paying higher prices for the stability and certainity. NIO is undervalued but less stable in the growth phase\" so Nio would give a better ROI based off the market cap regardless of the companies current performance. This was based mostly off this.\n\n1. Projected growth over time.\n2. Market caps of the companies.\n3. Company business model and phases of growth.\n\nI think NIO will give a better ROI over the next coming years. But I think Tesla is more stable. But stable is subjective, because I think both companies will succeed. But in terms of growth/spec, I believe Tesla priced in alot and for early investors like me, that's good. Because now I get the stability while owning Tesla at such a low price.\n\nWhile on the other hand Nio while i do believe will succeed in their own realm similarly to Tesla. Has yet to be priced in based off current market cap in terms of growth/spec. I also think the current phase of the company along with political climate, bullish economic projects for China, more money pouring into foreign/emerging markets/China, HKSE listing, more strict regulation on China will lead to more certainty and transparency etc. I think Nio has much potential investors while Tesla just simply does not.\n\nEven when you consider the pps. Regardless of the valuation, people see NIO as just a better choice. \" If you missed Tesla, then buy NIO.\" I also see the same large institutions selling Tesla and buy NIO. I think retail investors and the avg Joe is willing to buy what they see as a \"good deal\". Versus Tesla, ahen considering the current phase of growth, market caps, pps, and maybe later down the line factor in economic advantage/ political advantage.  \n\nIf you want to discuss \"oVeRvaLuEd\". I think we would have to consider looking at more than just NIO and Tesla and question the entire financial system.  I think we should consider many factors besides the company in order to predict where a price is headed. Regardless of the companies themselves, I think both will eventually move up in terms of market caps. And I'm not worried that these companoes will not make it. I'm more worried about old automakers in the U.S. but I'm sure they'll be bailed out.\n\nEDIT TLDR\nBe patient, last year Tesla and NIO did the same thing. NIO went up.

Because there is a glass ceiling and almost all EV companies will be near or around it. It's NIOs business model that will win. Because anyone can manufacture an EV and get the technology with enough R&D regardless of the slim talent pool. But NIO offers something to customers that Tesla simply cannot unless an overhaul of the company would to occur. \n\nSo while I do believe both companies will succeed. Nio will be more relevant at gaining market cap while Tesla in my honest opinion cannot. This comes down to the fundamental business models of each company. Nio is like Apple in a sense.
