The good part about stocks is because there’s no real time frame. If the market tanks and you’re in a solid stock, just hold on. \n\n2) again, it kind of depends what you’re looking for. The best thing I can point you towards for this is understanding delta. The basics of it is that for every dollar your underlying moves, your option will move one delta (someone can correct me on this because I may be wrong). I think of delta as like a fractional share. If you have .3 delta, you’re controlling 30/100 shares that the option represents. Theta accelerates (the amount you lose per day) sub 45 days. But the LEAPS can be illiquid and more expensive. If you want to essentially match the underlyings moves, yes, ITM is best. Say you’re at .8 delta, that means a 1$ gain in underlying = .80c gain on your option. \n\n3) losses are part of trading. They happen. The key is to limit them, and to make sure you don’t blow up your account if you make a wrong move. You have a good amount of time on those.

My view is it matters more on the stock itself. You can treat options as a way to do cheaper way to buy into a stock. If you want to average out your cost basis. IE: Rather than buying 100 shares a month, buy 1 call option and maybe 5-20 shares of stock. There are suggestions about 10% or less, but it's more about how leveraged you are. \n2. Depends, generally speaking you are seeking to replace stock with calls so you generally want the tax benefits of selling stock 1+ years out. Hence better to go with over a year. Somewhat OTM is probably better as it gives more room to grow. Perhaps a 40 delta. The more OTM you are, the lower the cost/share that you are effective getting. However, you also have higher theta decay which is effectively acting like margin interest fee (theta \\* 100 / (delta \\* 100 \\* stock price)), hence some go the other way and use a 80 delta instead, which is probably better if you think the stock price may not go up too much). So ideally you want to ensure that stays below what you would pay per day in margin. This tends to be around $0.25 per $1000 of margin usage or less depending on your margin interest rate. For the long term play you want to be reasonably sure that it will be ITM when you close it.\n3. For options you generally want to avoid exercising, and since it's OTM, you'd close money exercising it. Just sell it and get what you can in the remaining time value. Ideally you probably want to be buying LEAPs on a regular basis so that hopefully you'll have a good price more often than not. If the stock is down a lot, that means the LEAP you buy then will be a lot cheaper and assuming the price goes back up within a year, will make much more $$$. In the off chance it doesn't is why it's wise to buy some stock as well (since it isn't affected by theta decay). So this works best if you can regularly put in X amount of money each month. If your income is low, look at using bullish spreads though the theoretical ROI on those is less, so ideally close them for 50% profit, then eventually buy wider spreads until you can afford the call itself.\n\nAs for drawdowns. Stocks go up, stocks go down, as long as you are sure it's going back up, buy the dip (though keep in mind that it might dip even more, in which case you would want to buy even more, so have an idea of how much you want to increase your position if the price drops 5%/10%/20%/30% from it's last peak, and try to ensure you have the funds available for that.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If IV is cheap and you were already going to buy 100 shares, buying a long dated call is more capital effecient and lets you put on more positions that are hopefully uncorrelated. \n\nThats really it.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
{"title": "Carbon credit streaming is going to explode", "selftext": "Date\n7/30/2021\nSpeculator\nmidagedinvestor86\nContributors\n\nStrategy\nBullish / Stock (20% of portfolio, will likely go higher)\nTicker\n$OFSTF\nEntry Price\n$1.40\nPrice when I exited\nTBD\n\n\n\nHello! I’m a stock speculator and investor that is very bullish on carbon credits and companies in the space.  This is my thesis on what I see as the best company in the space: Carbon Streaming Corporation.  \n\nI’m not a financial advisor and you need to make your own decisions about what you do with your own money, I am just telling you why I am so bullish.  \n\nThesis\n\nCarbon credits are a relatively new commodity that few people have even heard of yet.  The market is growing at a rapid pace and is estimated by at least one leading natural resource investor (more on him later) to be larger than the oil market by the year 2050, maybe even as early as 2040.  That is not a typo, the growth in carbon credits is expected to make carbon credits the largest commodity market in the world in 30 years time. This is from a base of only about 1.5 billion this year total and only $320 million this year in the voluntary carbon market specifically.\n\n(https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/08/carbon-credits-institute-of-international-finance-sees-huge-potential.html)\n\nhttps://www.carbonstreaming.com/_resources/presentations/corporate-presentation.pdf?v=0.4\n\nWhy will this market grow so much in the next few decades?  Because going green is good business!  Regardless of whether you believe in man made global warming, this is one of the greatest money making opportunities of a generation and it would be foolish to not recognize and capitalize on it.\n\nThe ESG (Environmental, Sustainability, Governance) trend is unstoppable and requires that businesses around the world change their practices to make the world a better place.  One of the biggest ways of doing this is to lower their carbon emissions. While many countries around the world are creating cap and trade schemes, there is also a rapidly growing “voluntary” carbon market. Some companies such as large oil producers are in a business that will always generate massive amounts of CO2 emissions however they can “offset” this by producing or alternatively purchasing carbon credits.  Why would they do that?  Because they want to lower their cost of capital and make their shares attractive to the rapidly growing pools of capital that are mandated to only invest in ESG friendly companies.  By lowering their carbon emissions by purchasing carbon credits or building projects that generate carbon credits the company is then able to issue “green bonds”, which have a lower cost to the company than regular bond issuances: https://katusaresearch.com/carbonomics/  \n\nThe green bond market is massive and growing all the time.  These are bonds of companies that meet certain ESG specifications. Global ESG debt issuance just surpassed 3 trillion dollars in total this month. (Source: https://katusaresearch.com/carbonomics/)  And that will not stop growing.  It took 12 years for the first trillion in ESG bonds to be issued, the second trillion took one year, the third took only six months!\n\nThe cost of capital is critical for large scale capital intensive businesses like hydrocarbon production firms such as Exxon or Chevron or large industrial metal producers like Rio Tinto or Freeport.  By lowering their cost of capital these businesses create huge cost savings for their operations and by going green these companies open their shares up to be bought by far more institutional investors who, because of many factors, are often now required to only buy shares in businesses that have a good ESG scorecard.  While it costs money in legal fees, compliance officers etc. to make a company ESG friendly, the savings a company experiences from a lowered cost of capital more than makes up for it.  \n\nOil giant Shell unjust lost a court ruling in the Netherlands that will now require them to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030: https://www.reuters.com/business/legal/big-oil-may-get-more-climate-lawsuits-after-shell-ruling-lawyers-activists-2021-05-28/\n\n\nTo put this in perspective, this will require Shell to buy and/or create 100 million carbon credits per year for the next decade.  Is Shell just a one off? No!  24 hours after the Shell court ruling, the board of directors of Exxon was disrupted and two board seats were won in an acrimonious proxy fight by an unknown climate fund called Engine No.1. \n\nThen the shareholders of Chevron voted, and changes will happen there too.\n\nIt is inevitable that other large oil companies and large resource miners get with the program.  \n\nCarbon credit prices in the voluntary market are likely to rise considerably over the next few years.  As legendary Canadian resource investor Marin Katusa puts it: \n\n“All of this is building up a pressure chamber of demand in the Voluntary Carbon Market that has not yet reached a tipping point.\n\nWhen it does, there’s a lot of upside to be had.\n\nBecause It’s the perfect setup for a long squeeze in the Voluntary Carbon Market:\n\nRising emissions from a growing population.\nTightening government mandates on carbon emissions.\nIncreasing consumer demand for environmental responsible.\nMore transparency in emissions reporting.\nCorporate buy-in at every level, even from non-emitting companies.\nAll together, this is going to result in a desperate scramble for high-quality carbon offsets, of which there are few.\n\nIf you thought the rise in the price of lumber was crazy in early 2021…\n\nJust wait until you see the VCM market in five years.”\n\n(https://katusaresearch.com/the-adoption-rate-of-this-obscure-commodity-will-be-the-fastest-of-all-commodities/)\n\nIf you want to read more a really good primer on Carbon Credits read this: https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkobayashisolomon/2020/03/13/want-to-understand-carbon-credits-read-this/?sh=4032228671aa\n\n\n\nCompany Overview\n\nCarbon Streaming Corporation (“CSC”) just went public in Canada under the ticker symbol NETZ (for “Net Zero”) and trades in the US on the over the counter exchange under the ticker symbol OFSTF.  \n\nThe business model CSC is going to employ is in my opinion brilliant. They are going to finance carbon credit generation projects all over the world in exchange for streams of carbon credits.  Let me explain.\n \nBack in the 1980’s and 1990’s companies like Franco Nevada, Wheaton Precious Metals, and Royal Gold pioneered a new business model within the gold industry.  Instead of spending money exploring for gold deposits and putting them into production by building mines, they provided investment capital to mining companies in exchange for royalties on the mine's gold production.  For example, the royalty company would invest say 150 million dollars into a miner and in exchange they would receive 2% of all the revenue generated by the mine over the entire life of the mine.  By doing this the royalty company got exposure to the price of the underlying commodity but took drastically less risk by avoiding having to build and operate the mine themselves.  Later this business model added the concept of “streams”.  A “stream” or “streaming deal”  is one where again the royalty company like Franco Nevada puts up serious money to help another firm build their mine, and in exchange they get the option, for example, of purchasing say 20% of all the gold produced by the mine for an artificially low price of $400 per ounce.  This deal would be called a “gold stream”.\n\nThis business model has worked remarkably well in the precious metals space with Franco Nevada returning much more over the long term than gold itself, the Nasdaq, and GDX, the markets leading gold stock ETF:  https://www.franco-nevada.com/about-us/Overview/default.aspx\n\nThese royalty stocks trade at drastically higher multiples than golder miners themselves and currently the three biggest precious metal royalty companies, Franco Nevada, Wheaton, and Royal Gold trade at price to sales ratios of 28, 18, and 14 respectively: www.Finviz.com\n\nEnter Carbon Streaming Corporation.  This company is going to employ the Franco Nevada royalty model to Carbon Credits.  The company just raised over $100 million USD in a financing bringing the total cash in their treasury to $141 million USD with no debt.  With about 200 million shares outstanding undiluted this amounts to about $0.70 per share in cash.  The stock currently trades at about $1.40 per share meaning that when you “net out” the cash, the market is giving Carbon Steaming an Enterprise Value of $140 million.  In my opinion this is cheap given the size of the opportunity, the quality of management, and the first mover advantage the company will enjoy for the next 6-12 months.\n\nThe CEO of Carbon Streaming is Mr. Justin Cochrane, former investment banker and executive vice president of Sandstorm Gold (NYSE: SAND) , a very successful gold royalty company that has grown from a tiny micro cap to a large player in the space that may one day be considered amongst the giants like Franco Nevada.  He has personally been involved with hundreds of millions of dollars of royalty transactions in the precious metals space.  He put up millions of dollars of his own money in this latest financing round which is critically important when considering investing in smaller companies in my opinion. The management team as a whole bought 10 million worth of the latest financing.  \n\nThe shareholder roster for the company is also very impressive and includes legendary Canadian resource entrepreneurs/investors Marin Katusa and Ross Beatty.  Mr. Katusa recently took down almost 10% of the over $100 million dollar financing and is considered by many to be the “Young Warren Buffett” of resource investing up here in Canada.  He tends to be very reserved and conservative in his valuation models and very selective about his stock picks and entry prices.  He is the company’s largest shareholder.  In his words: “The amount of capital that has and will continue to be deployed into the Carbonomics Sector is mind boggling—it’s in the hundreds of billions and will reach the trillions….Carbon Streaming Corp is the first company to get involved in the financing and production of carbon credits at a large scale. The company is priced attractively for speculators, given the early-stage venture risk….I do believe that by 2030, the carbon market can be larger than copper and gold markets, and by 2040 could be $2 trillion larger than the oil market. Let that sink in for a moment.  The opportunity here is so compelling and we have a chance to get a core position in one of the leaders in this industry before it gets listed on a Big League exchange.”\n\nThe company currently owns two Carbon Credit Streams, the Marvivo Blue Carbon Project and the Bonobo Peace Forest Project.  Management has stated both of these projects have Internal Rates of Return (IRR) greater than 15% which is unheard of at this point in the precious metals sector given all of the  new companies and competitors have entered the space over the last 10 years. I will not go into the details here but Blue Carbon Credits are superior to regular Carbon credits and will trade at a substantial premium in terms of price.  Basically blue carbon credits are created by the growth and conservation of carbon-absorbing plants, such as mangrove forests and their associated marine habitat.  A blue carbon project will have its carbon credits trade at a premium because of the enormous second-order benefits on such things as, for example, corals, algae, and marine biodiversity that have been so deleteriously affected by over-fishing and farming.\n\nI expect management to start to deploy their war chest of cash immediately to build their portfolio of high quality carbon credit streams to position itself as the Franco Nevada of the Carbon Credit space.  These deals should be positive catalysts for the stock moving forward.  Management has stated they are aiming to exit 2023 at a revenue run rate of $200 million USD per year.  And that is only using CURRENT PRICING for carbon credits, which actually are expected to move much higher in price over the next few years.  Putting a 10-20x pierce to sales multiple on that would peg CSC with a market cap in the billions in a little over 2 years.  But with all the “hot money” capital that will seek to enter this space over the next two years I would not be surprised if the market cap gets much higher than that.  The reason for this is simple.  Other than the exchange traded fund KRBN there are still very few ways for investors to get “pure play” exposure to carbon credits.  CSC is going to be the first publicly listed company that provides investors with a way to invest in an equity 100% focused on carbon credits.  Given the massive amount of capital looking to get in on this emerging hot investment trend and the tiny amount of options available to those investors, there will likely be massive buying pressure on the stock.  Think of a fire hose worth of water trying to get pushed through the eye of a needle!\n\nWhile the stock currently trades on the OTC market in the US, management has made it clear that they will seek to uplist the stock to the Nasdaq or the NYSE before the end of 2021.  While this seems a bit optimistic to me in terms of timing I fully expect the company to uplist at least by the end of first quarter 2022.  \n\nRisks\n\nWhile the stock has a sizable market cap already the shares are very illiquid and if a market crash were to occur before the stock becomes more well known it may be tough to get out of a sizable position quickly without trashing the stock price even more.\n\nCompetition-Carbon Streaming has first mover advantage in the space but I expect numerous “me too” companies to pop up in the next 6-12 months with the same business model and this will create competition for the carbon streams that may drive down the Internal Rates of Returns on streams as companies try to outbid each other for the various deals to be had.  \n\nTrump gets back in in 2024 however I think this would merely create an initial shock lower in the stock and it would soon recover given that their assets will likely be located all over the world.\n\n\n\nG Trends \n\nYou cannot do a Dumb Money High conviction Doc without including G Trend data.  My experience with G Trends is limited and there may be better ways to use it for this trade but for now I am just going to show the 5 year charts for “carbon credit” worldwide and then in the USA.  As you can see, both seem to be picking up steam in the last year or two:\n\n\n\n￼\n\n\n\n￼\n\n\n \nHere are the 5 year trends when using the keywords “Low-carbon economy” for worldwide and US searches respectively:\n\n￼\n\n\n￼\n\n\nHere are the 5 year G trends for “Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance” worldwide and from the US respectively \n\n￼\n\n\n￼\n\n\n\n\n Conclusion \n\nThe carbon credit market is starting to take off and is poised for massive growth over the next 5, 10 and 20 years.  CSC has perfectly positioned itself to take advantage of this trend by employing the proven and golden business model (pun intended) of royalty and streaming financing to this fast emerging intangible commodity space.  We have a chance to get in on the ground floor of a company that could easily be worth many billions of dollars at a tiny market cap before it lists on a major exchange.  The company has all the cash and management expertise that it needs to execute its business model and create enormous wealth for early shareholders.  Good luck and good investing to all!", "id": "ovbr7j", "created_utc": 1627754219.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "Hello!

{"title": "The 1 trillion dollar repo market simplified and highly reductive.", "selftext": "Okay so today we saw 1 trillion in Repo market activity. Banks have too much cash. They throw it back to the Fed Treasury overnight at a .05%APR bond. As asinine as it sounds too much cash as a bank is a liability due to inflation. So in order to not get slaughtered by inflation they take meager returns from the Fed. Purchasing an overnight bond from the FED is considered an asset. But let's reduct this a bit. I can buy a bond with cash and that bond would be can asset to me. That's what banks are doing. They are shifting liability (cash) for an asset (bond). Now let's move to step 2. While the Fed is issuing bonds they are essentially issuing debt. You give me 1000 I'll pay you 1001 at the end of the night. This is alright due to the debt ceiling. But the debt ceiling is approaching. I believe congress will raise the debt ceiling. So that kicks can down road. They always have in past. But what worries me is banks that are absolutely flush with cash can't find a better use for it? There best guess is an overnight parking spot? Mind you if banks for example park 1,000,000 in this parking spot they are getting .005 over the year. .005x1,000,000 is $5000. $5000÷365 = $13.69 a night on a million dollars. Think about it if I was a bank and my business is making financial deals making 13 bucks on a million is dog shit. It's a waste. So why are they putting all this cash here? I don't doubt for a second that these banks are exponentially more savy than anyone in this subreddit and that's the most rational decision they could come to. Between loans, mortgages, investments, forex, construction, etc they chose to park it in a overnight parking garage for dog shit. This leads me to my finale. They park it here because this is the least risky option they have at there disposal and that's fucking scary. There in the business of keeping whatever they have and fucking you out of whatever you have. They're banks. It's in their nature a la scorpion and the bullfrog. Of the options at their disposal they chose this route because it's the only viable option at this juncture. That's scary. Especially since market wise the S&P 500 hit new highs just yesterday. There are tons of options in money markets. There are even more options in loans for let's say corporate bonds but no they didn't pick them. They have no faith in lending to businesses even though there is need. If that was a viable option we wouldn't see 1,000,000,000,000 in dog shit overnight parking garages. They have no faith in the recovery of America out of the coronavirus bullshit. This should scare you. What happens when banks, our lifeline of credit stop interaction with the economy at large because of \"MuH .0o5%\". They simply ran out of good deals. In closing to back track a bit banks need assets as collateral for outstanding positions they have. In order to not get liquidated out of riskier positions they have to have enough assets on the books to keep the game going. This is a grown up margin call. I think alot of this reshuffling is meant to give our biggest banks \"assets\" that stand as collateral in the wake of underwater investments. Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Citi Credit Suisse etc do investment banking.

{"title": "Carbon streaming is the future", "selftext": "Date\n7/30/2021\nSpeculator\nmidagedinvestor86\nContributors\n\nStrategy\nBullish / Stock (20% of portfolio, will likely go higher)\nTicker\n$OFSTF\nEntry Price\n$1.40\nPrice when I exited\nTBD\n\n\n\nHello! I’m a stock speculator and investor that is very bullish on carbon credits and companies in the space.  This is my thesis on what I see as the best company in the space: Carbon Streaming Corporation.  \n\nI’m not a financial advisor and you need to make your own decisions about what you do with your own money, I am just telling you why I am so bullish.  \n\nThesis\n\nCarbon credits are a relatively new commodity that few people have even heard of yet.  The market is growing at a rapid pace and is estimated by at least one leading natural resource investor (more on him later) to be larger than the oil market by the year 2050, maybe even as early as 2040.  That is not a typo, the growth in carbon credits is expected to make carbon credits the largest commodity market in the world in 30 years time. This is from a base of only about 1.5 billion this year total and only $320 million this year in the voluntary carbon market specifically.\n\n(https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/08/carbon-credits-institute-of-international-finance-sees-huge-potential.html)\n\nhttps://www.carbonstreaming.com/_resources/presentations/corporate-presentation.pdf?v=0.4\n\nWhy will this market grow so much in the next few decades?  Because going green is good business!  Regardless of whether you believe in man made global warming, this is one of the greatest money making opportunities of a generation and it would be foolish to not recognize and capitalize on it.\n\nThe ESG (Environmental, Sustainability, Governance) trend is unstoppable and requires that businesses around the world change their practices to make the world a better place.  One of the biggest ways of doing this is to lower their carbon emissions. While many countries around the world are creating cap and trade schemes, there is also a rapidly growing “voluntary” carbon market. Some companies such as large oil producers are in a business that will always generate massive amounts of CO2 emissions however they can “offset” this by producing or alternatively purchasing carbon credits.  Why would they do that?  Because they want to lower their cost of capital and make their shares attractive to the rapidly growing pools of capital that are mandated to only invest in ESG friendly companies.  By lowering their carbon emissions by purchasing carbon credits or building projects that generate carbon credits the company is then able to issue “green bonds”, which have a lower cost to the company than regular bond issuances: https://katusaresearch.com/carbonomics/  \n\nThe green bond market is massive and growing all the time.  These are bonds of companies that meet certain ESG specifications. Global ESG debt issuance just surpassed 3 trillion dollars in total this month. (Source: https://katusaresearch.com/carbonomics/)  And that will not stop growing.  It took 12 years for the first trillion in ESG bonds to be issued, the second trillion took one year, the third took only six months!\n\nThe cost of capital is critical for large scale capital intensive businesses like hydrocarbon production firms such as Exxon or Chevron or large industrial metal producers like Rio Tinto or Freeport.  By lowering their cost of capital these businesses create huge cost savings for their operations and by going green these companies open their shares up to be bought by far more institutional investors who, because of many factors, are often now required to only buy shares in businesses that have a good ESG scorecard.  While it costs money in legal fees, compliance officers etc. to make a company ESG friendly, the savings a company experiences from a lowered cost of capital more than makes up for it.  \n\nOil giant Shell unjust lost a court ruling in the Netherlands that will now require them to cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 45% by 2030: https://www.reuters.com/business/legal/big-oil-may-get-more-climate-lawsuits-after-shell-ruling-lawyers-activists-2021-05-28/\n\n\nTo put this in perspective, this will require Shell to buy and/or create 100 million carbon credits per year for the next decade.  Is Shell just a one off? No!  24 hours after the Shell court ruling, the board of directors of Exxon was disrupted and two board seats were won in an acrimonious proxy fight by an unknown climate fund called Engine No.1. \n\nThen the shareholders of Chevron voted, and changes will happen there too.\n\nIt is inevitable that other large oil companies and large resource miners get with the program.  \n\nCarbon credit prices in the voluntary market are likely to rise considerably over the next few years.  As legendary Canadian resource investor Marin Katusa puts it: \n\n“All of this is building up a pressure chamber of demand in the Voluntary Carbon Market that has not yet reached a tipping point.\n\nWhen it does, there’s a lot of upside to be had.\n\nBecause It’s the perfect setup for a long squeeze in the Voluntary Carbon Market:\n\nRising emissions from a growing population.\nTightening government mandates on carbon emissions.\nIncreasing consumer demand for environmental responsible.\nMore transparency in emissions reporting.\nCorporate buy-in at every level, even from non-emitting companies.\nAll together, this is going to result in a desperate scramble for high-quality carbon offsets, of which there are few.\n\nIf you thought the rise in the price of lumber was crazy in early 2021…\n\nJust wait until you see the VCM market in five years.”\n\n(https://katusaresearch.com/the-adoption-rate-of-this-obscure-commodity-will-be-the-fastest-of-all-commodities/)\n\nIf you want to read more a really good primer on Carbon Credits read this: https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkobayashisolomon/2020/03/13/want-to-understand-carbon-credits-read-this/?sh=4032228671aa\n\n\n\nCompany Overview\n\nCarbon Streaming Corporation (“CSC”) just went public in Canada under the ticker symbol NETZ (for “Net Zero”) and trades in the US on the over the counter exchange under the ticker symbol OFSTF.  \n\nThe business model CSC is going to employ is in my opinion brilliant. They are going to finance carbon credit generation projects all over the world in exchange for streams of carbon credits.  Let me explain.\n \nBack in the 1980’s and 1990’s companies like Franco Nevada, Wheaton Precious Metals, and Royal Gold pioneered a new business model within the gold industry.  Instead of spending money exploring for gold deposits and putting them into production by building mines, they provided investment capital to mining companies in exchange for royalties on the mine's gold production.  For example, the royalty company would invest say 150 million dollars into a miner and in exchange they would receive 2% of all the revenue generated by the mine over the entire life of the mine.  By doing this the royalty company got exposure to the price of the underlying commodity but took drastically less risk by avoiding having to build and operate the mine themselves.  Later this business model added the concept of “streams”.  A “stream” or “streaming deal”  is one where again the royalty company like Franco Nevada puts up serious money to help another firm build their mine, and in exchange they get the option, for example, of purchasing say 20% of all the gold produced by the mine for an artificially low price of $400 per ounce.  This deal would be called a “gold stream”.\n\nThis business model has worked remarkably well in the precious metals space with Franco Nevada returning much more over the long term than gold itself, the Nasdaq, and GDX, the markets leading gold stock ETF:  https://www.franco-nevada.com/about-us/Overview/default.aspx\n\nThese royalty stocks trade at drastically higher multiples than golder miners themselves and currently the three biggest precious metal royalty companies, Franco Nevada, Wheaton, and Royal Gold trade at price to sales ratios of 28, 18, and 14 respectively: www.Finviz.com\n\nEnter Carbon Streaming Corporation.  This company is going to employ the Franco Nevada royalty model to Carbon Credits.  The company just raised over $100 million USD in a financing bringing the total cash in their treasury to $141 million USD with no debt.  With about 200 million shares outstanding undiluted this amounts to about $0.70 per share in cash.  The stock currently trades at about $1.40 per share meaning that when you “net out” the cash, the market is giving Carbon Steaming an Enterprise Value of $140 million.  In my opinion this is cheap given the size of the opportunity, the quality of management, and the first mover advantage the company will enjoy for the next 6-12 months.\n\nThe CEO of Carbon Streaming is Mr. Justin Cochrane, former investment banker and executive vice president of Sandstorm Gold (NYSE: SAND) , a very successful gold royalty company that has grown from a tiny micro cap to a large player in the space that may one day be considered amongst the giants like Franco Nevada.  He has personally been involved with hundreds of millions of dollars of royalty transactions in the precious metals space.  He put up millions of dollars of his own money in this latest financing round which is critically important when considering investing in smaller companies in my opinion. The management team as a whole bought 10 million worth of the latest financing.  \n\nThe shareholder roster for the company is also very impressive and includes legendary Canadian resource entrepreneurs/investors Marin Katusa and Ross Beatty.  Mr. Katusa recently took down almost 10% of the over $100 million dollar financing and is considered by many to be the “Young Warren Buffett” of resource investing up here in Canada.  He tends to be very reserved and conservative in his valuation models and very selective about his stock picks and entry prices.  He is the company’s largest shareholder.  In his words: “The amount of capital that has and will continue to be deployed into the Carbonomics Sector is mind boggling—it’s in the hundreds of billions and will reach the trillions….Carbon Streaming Corp is the first company to get involved in the financing and production of carbon credits at a large scale. The company is priced attractively for speculators, given the early-stage venture risk….I do believe that by 2030, the carbon market can be larger than copper and gold markets, and by 2040 could be $2 trillion larger than the oil market. Let that sink in for a moment.  The opportunity here is so compelling and we have a chance to get a core position in one of the leaders in this industry before it gets listed on a Big League exchange.”\n\nThe company currently owns two Carbon Credit Streams, the Marvivo Blue Carbon Project and the Bonobo Peace Forest Project.  Management has stated both of these projects have Internal Rates of Return (IRR) greater than 15% which is unheard of at this point in the precious metals sector given all of the  new companies and competitors have entered the space over the last 10 years. I will not go into the details here but Blue Carbon Credits are superior to regular Carbon credits and will trade at a substantial premium in terms of price.  Basically blue carbon credits are created by the growth and conservation of carbon-absorbing plants, such as mangrove forests and their associated marine habitat.  A blue carbon project will have its carbon credits trade at a premium because of the enormous second-order benefits on such things as, for example, corals, algae, and marine biodiversity that have been so deleteriously affected by over-fishing and farming.\n\nI expect management to start to deploy their war chest of cash immediately to build their portfolio of high quality carbon credit streams to position itself as the Franco Nevada of the Carbon Credit space.  These deals should be positive catalysts for the stock moving forward.  Management has stated they are aiming to exit 2023 at a revenue run rate of $200 million USD per year.  And that is only using CURRENT PRICING for carbon credits, which actually are expected to move much higher in price over the next few years.  Putting a 10-20x pierce to sales multiple on that would peg CSC with a market cap in the billions in a little over 2 years.  But with all the “hot money” capital that will seek to enter this space over the next two years I would not be surprised if the market cap gets much higher than that.  The reason for this is simple.  Other than the exchange traded fund KRBN there are still very few ways for investors to get “pure play” exposure to carbon credits.  CSC is going to be the first publicly listed company that provides investors with a way to invest in an equity 100% focused on carbon credits.  Given the massive amount of capital looking to get in on this emerging hot investment trend and the tiny amount of options available to those investors, there will likely be massive buying pressure on the stock.  Think of a fire hose worth of water trying to get pushed through the eye of a needle!\n\nWhile the stock currently trades on the OTC market in the US, management has made it clear that they will seek to uplist the stock to the Nasdaq or the NYSE before the end of 2021.  While this seems a bit optimistic to me in terms of timing I fully expect the company to uplist at least by the end of first quarter 2022.  \n\nRisks\n\nWhile the stock has a sizable market cap already the shares are very illiquid and if a market crash were to occur before the stock becomes more well known it may be tough to get out of a sizable position quickly without trashing the stock price even more.\n\nCompetition-Carbon Streaming has first mover advantage in the space but I expect numerous “me too” companies to pop up in the next 6-12 months with the same business model and this will create competition for the carbon streams that may drive down the Internal Rates of Returns on streams as companies try to outbid each other for the various deals to be had.  \n\nTrump gets back in in 2024 however I think this would merely create an initial shock lower in the stock and it would soon recover given that their assets will likely be located all over the world.\n\n\n\nG Trends \n\nYou cannot do a Dumb Money High conviction Doc without including G Trend data.  My experience with G Trends is limited and there may be better ways to use it for this trade but for now I am just going to show the 5 year charts for “carbon credit” worldwide and then in the USA.  As you can see, both seem to be picking up steam in the last year or two:\n\n\n\n￼\n\n\n\n￼\n\n\n \nHere are the 5 year trends when using the keywords “Low-carbon economy” for worldwide and US searches respectively:\n\n￼\n\n\n￼\n\n\nHere are the 5 year G trends for “Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance” worldwide and from the US respectively \n\n￼\n\n\n￼\n\n\n\n\n Conclusion \n\nThe carbon credit market is starting to take off and is poised for massive growth over the next 5, 10 and 20 years.  CSC has perfectly positioned itself to take advantage of this trend by employing the proven and golden business model (pun intended) of royalty and streaming financing to this fast emerging intangible commodity space.  We have a chance to get in on the ground floor of a company that could easily be worth many billions of dollars at a tiny market cap before it lists on a major exchange.  The company has all the cash and management expertise that it needs to execute its business model and create enormous wealth for early shareholders.  Good luck and good investing to all!", "id": "ovbqnl", "created_utc": 1627754160.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "Yes!

If you were just long 40 VIX calls, and it spiked to 50 - do you take profit there on that bloody day (and thereby removing any further hedge)?  Or wait for more?  “Etc”.

Figuring if SPX drops 3% or more before I can do a defensive roll - those should start to offset my nearing-max-loss on the SPX spread.\n\nThis article suggests a 15:1 SPX_drop:VIX_spike ratio - so (4395-4260) 135 SPX drop should theoretically send VIX up 9 points (135/15):\n\nhttp://tastytradenetwork.squarespace.com/tt/blog/the-relationship-between-the-spx-and-vix\n\nSo that’s one exit trigger - achieving max loss on what I’m hedging - “close-out, close the hedge, start again after things settle down”.\n\nBut what if the drop is slow enough that I can do my defensive roll and “stay in the game”?  My hedge is then increasing in value, but I want to keep it on - how far do I let it run?\n\nFor me - once it hits my short VIX spread strike at 37.5 - “close out time”.
