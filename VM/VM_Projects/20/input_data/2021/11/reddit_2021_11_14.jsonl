The name of the game this week is Retails Giants and Chinese Tech, and it‚Äôs here where we‚Äôll find some of our most lucrative opportunities. Although it may not seem like it, some of the companies in these sectors have extremely large historical moves, meaning we‚Äôve got the potential to make some serious dough. We‚Äôre also approaching holiday season, meaning that many retailers will give adjusted guidance on their calls in light of the supply chain issues that have been plaguing the globe, adding to the intensity of these already large moves. Let‚Äôs get into it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eV9BTySXfVbMnVZFp5IfkaYf_xETjYyplJh_r-SLMjg/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eV9BTySXfVbMnVZFp5IfkaYf_xETjYyplJh_r-SLMjg/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **The premiums on $NNOX are intoxicating.** Options are pricing around a 17% move at the time of writing, but historically $NNOX only moves 9%. Unfortunately for us, the sample size on this company is small, so we need to tread a little more carefully than usual. Regardless, the most $NNOX has ever moved post earnings is 18%, meaning even if we do get a ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù move, we won‚Äôt lose much money. I will likely opt to sell a 20/28 strangle once I conduct all little more research into the company later this week. I want to see if I can uncover any reasons regarding ***why*** the premiums are so high.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **$FL options will be extremely cheap come Friday.** Currently, the options are pricing an 8.3% move relative to the historical move of 9.3% , making them relatively efficient. Given that volatility doesn‚Äôt inflate throughout the week, these options should become extremely cheap by Friday since theta will murder the extrinsic value on them. Footlocker is no stranger to large moves, and if we can enter a lotto strangle for cheap Thursday before close, we could be looking at a handsome return come Friday morning. A straddle will currently run you $460, but by Friday this number may be closer to $300. If that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôll roll the dice on this one - I like my odds.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Chinese tech give us an awesome collateral play opportunity!** $KWEB is a high liquidity ETF consisting of all of the Chinese tech stocks who report this week. If it behaves anything like American tech does during earnings week, there should be a clear directional move in the entire ETF. If we‚Äôre bullish or bearish on Chinese tech as a whole, we should look to go long or short on $KWEB instead of any of the individual tickers in order to mitigate our risks and generate significantly greater profits. For more information on this type of play, check out my in-depth writeup on collateral plays [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eV9BTySXfVbMnVZFp5IfkaYf_xETjYyplJh_r-SLMjg/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!

Basically I was looking to build a snapshot of each company. The POS. column is a result of compiling the options contracts ending the week with the highest open interest. My actual position is to the far left. $SPREAD indicates the range between the current price and the strike price of the contract. NET/GROSS is for the last reported yearly financials. All data was pulled from either Yahoo or Nasdaq. Numbers are accurate-ish. I have no background in finance, so Im expecting to learn from this. Would definitely appreciate feedback from those who know what they're doing. I understand IV crush limits or extinguishes profits on contracts held through earnings, so Im taking positions that I think will have meaningful price movement. Green on the row means I have calls, and red puts.\n\nQFIN: this company has a low and positive P/E and lower estimate for the next year. They beat earnings last quarter by 25.42% and a profit margin of 25.78%. A price point of 26.04 is affordable they're involved in data so Im giving it a go.\n\nMVST: there's a lot better DD on this site than this, but overall it looks like they're going to start growing into positive earnings, and if contracts with USPS come through, it'll be a great play. beat earnings last quarter by 91%. The options with the highest open interest are puts, but I see a great upside here.\n\nDAVA: This company has a high P/E but they beat earnings and have a profit margin of 28.24%. The options with leading OI are already ITM.\n\nSTNE: Looks solid across the board. Affordable. crushed EPS last quarter. good profit margin.\n\nSBLK: Affordable. Super low P/E estimate. Maybe moving into big earnings. Still positive profit margin. Might do a late DOE on this.\n\nDLO: affordable: PM is huge. Big upside on the favored strike price.\n\nWPC: a little pricey. Looks like a solid company overall.\n\nTGT: Huge upside for puts. The spread makes me think people know something I don't. 83% of open interest is for puts here. Would really like to hear someones opinion on this.\n\nLOW: Same as TGT. huge spread of the strike price. Less percentage overall for puts. A lot of analysts are saying its over weight. Maybe they'll have dog shit earnings?\n\nZIM: this seems like the star of the show. The financials are solid. Super low P/E estimate. nice spread on strike price. Insane profit margin. Big time go.\n\nNVDA: everyones buying this anyway.\n\nYY: no position here yet. Just curious how they have a negative operating cost that puts NET above Gross.\n\nPlease let me know if Im a total smooth brain retard or what.
