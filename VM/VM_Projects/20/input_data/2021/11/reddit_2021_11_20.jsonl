It accounts for numerous factors in its calculation: time remaining until expiration, implied volatility of the stock, how far the strike price is from the current stock price, and more. Market makers use computers to calculate option values using this model in real time as the underlying moves, which allows them to always maintain favorable bid/ask prices. \n\nYour question on how much money you would make if you bought and sold the option above can be answered using the model, but a rough estimation can be obtained using the so-called greeks. The greeks quantify key parameters of an option, such as how quickly its value will decay with time (theta), how much a change in implied volatility will affect its value (vega), or how a change in the underlying’s price will affect the value (delta and gamma). Going in-depth here is too long, but for a quick example, a theta value of -0.25 means an option will lose $0.25/share of value ($25 total) over the next day, while a delta value of 0.60 means an option will increase in value by $0.60/share per $1 increase in the underlying share price. If you plan on trading options, it’s vital to research and understand these well. \n\nThere are option calculator tools out there that can determine option values for you in a range of hypothetical conditions (stock price changes, time passing, IV changes, etc.). I use OptionStrat, it’s a free app that’s easy to use, but there are others. That way you don’t have to do any math yourself.\n\nEdit: the premium on the option you posted would be roughly halfway between the bid/ask of $84.80 to $86.45/share.

Almost two decades of underspending on the key infrastructure needed to secure supply chains\n\nLA, for example, has ~75 ships waiting to unload cargo. In American units, if laid end to end, they compromise the distance of 300 football fields. Lock downs and work restrictions left ports completely incapable of unloading in a timely manner. Prior to 2020, ports ran at 99% capacity. Meaning, they had just enough ability to keep up, with absolutely no extra ability to handle higher demands. \"Just on time\" being the mantra by which the US and Europe operate.\n\nContrast this with ports such as the Shanghai port, which had the foresight to continue to invest and build. China boasts the largest ports in the world (its really not even close), and most, like Shanghai, are completely automated. Maximum efficiency, with zero down time, and record setting loading-unloading speeds.\n\nSo, following the shut downs in the west, no one was able to unload ships. So they continued (and continue) to pile up off the coast. Because these ports were built and operated with no forward thinking, they have no extra ability to catch up.\n\nThis is exacerbated by the incompetence of individuals like the mayor of LA and their horrendous policies. Because the US doesn't export anything, they have nothing to load into the empty containers that come back to the ports. Which is fine when everything runs normally, but is a disaster currently. LA and similar ports only allow empty containers to be stacked 2 high. Trucks bringing empty containers back have no place to unload them. Because they can't unload them, they don't have an empty chassis to pick up full containers. Because full containers aren't being picked up, more can't be off loaded from ships. And the cycle continues.\n\nAll this places enormous strain on the supply chain. Deliveries to the end point normally done 1-3 months out now take upwards of 6-12 months. Trickling supply obviously results in an inability to meet demand. And once again, because of a lack of planning, there's no good way to catch back up.\n\nThere are other issues as well, obviously. Well above average inflation doesn't help. The Suez canal incident set back shipments upwards of a month. General increased demand means more cargo trying to move through canal choke points. Shipping companies don't want to build new ships because government regulations on emissions will render their expensive newbuilds obsolete within 10 years vs an average of 25 years service, but the technology to meet these requirements is still too new to mass build, and builds take over a year to complete anyway.", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "the longshoremen union threaten to strike whenever port companies want to introduce any hint of automation.

I counted only ~7 that were even operating and those that were seemed to be going pretty slow. \nIt seems that everyone now agrees that the bottleneck is yard space at the container terminals. The terminals are simply overflowing with containers, which means they no longer have space to take in new containers either from ships or land. It’s a true traffic jam. \nRight now if you have a chassis with no empty container on it, you can go pick up containers at any port terminal. However, if you have an empty container on that chassis, they’re not allowing you to return it except on highly restricted basis. \n \nIf you can’t get the empty off the chassis, you don’t have a chassis to go pick up the next container.

But really not that bad either. Who would could have guessed the crazy run from 800 to 1200 in what, two weeks? Based on  a *good* news I guess, which turned out to be not the news l at all? \n\nHowever, I think situations are extremely different. Those times people were really betting that Tesla is going bankrupt, or Tesla would never make a profit without regulatory credits, and so on and so forth. Now, it turned out to be false. However, the price went up (checking notes) about x20 within 2 years. I think it way overshoot. \n\nAnd here is my take now. Back then bears were overly pessimistic. Right now, bulls are overly optimistic. They are starting to project 50% growth over the next 10 year. They project increase in margins, although margins within 10 years will certainly go down due to combination of competition as well as phasing out of various tax rebates and subsidies. People are overly optimistic about Tesla MOATs: FSD which is *NOWHERE* to be close to what Elon originally promised (will try to explain myself briefly in follow up Tesla DD), 4680 which is basically just a bigger battery, maybe manufacturing will be cheaper, maybe not? And list goes on and on. People take Elon's words (i mean pumps) for granted. I cannot blame them, he made them shit loads of money. Its unconscious bias. \n\nAnyway, if there is a better time to short, it is now. When everything rainbow, and Tesla will go to 2T in few months, and 10T by 2030 amirite? Reminds me of Cisco in 2000. It was 500B market cap biggest company in the world (equivalent to 1500B in the current market) and analysts were projecting 2T (in those days) in just few years... turned out to be good for investors, ha?
