Figure TSLA hasn’t went crazy with $50 or $80 dollar gain days…..\n\nAnyway, I waited till Thursday. It didn’t feel like losing my shares.

The 100 shares, some short/long.\n2) If I BTC option save my shares, with no roll. It’s $8000 loss 😂.\n\nSo what would you do?\n\nA) roll flat (same strike) with credit by weekly? Hope it drops enough to escape with minimal loss.\n\nB) roll and increase strike maybe to 1060-1080 by a month for credit?\n\nC) just let it get assigned (basically didn’t gain the $7800 from 1050 to 1128) hope this week it doesn’t go up to $1400.

If you did you would indeed have to come up with $100,000.   Instead you can sell the option at anytime, during normal trading.\n\nAn example of one LEAP:\n\nTesla call option with a strike price of $1050.00 which expires on 3/17/2023\n\nIt was bought on 7/16/2021 for $8975.00\n\nIt has a “break even” price of $1139.75\n\nThat “break even” price is a simple calculation: \n\nstrike price + purchase cost = breakeven price\n\nOr\n\n1050.00 + 89.75 = 1139.75\n\nThe break even price can be a little misleading.  It is the price the stock needs to be at at the moment of expiration for you to get your initial investment back.\n\nAs I stated initially I have no intention of waiting that long.\n\nBecause I bought the option at a time of low volatility (it was some where in the 20s) and right now the stock IV for that call is 52.47% there is a huge run up of the cost of that option.\n\nRight now it costs: $29,550.00 \n\nIf I sell tomorrow at this price I make 229.25% profit on my investment \n\nThat’s it.\n\nBut if I sell now I pay short term capital gains on the profits which can be as high as 37% if you earn enough money, if I sit on it for 1 year from the date of purchase, then sell it after, it is only taxed at 15% (in the United States)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This is so helpful but can you clarify again. The purchase price you said was $8975 but in the strike price you said its $89.75. Is the strike price calculation incorrect or is it 1% of the purchase price?\n\nSo do I understand correctly, you buy the contract when the price is 600 that says you have the option to buy 100 shares at a pre determined strike price of say 1050 up to 1.5 years in the future. If the share price reaches 1050 then you can sell it at anytime up to the end date determined when you bought it so maybe 3/2023. So you could wait until 12/2022 during a rally where rhe price is now $2005 but if you actually bought the 100 shares it would still only cost you $1005 each.\n\nBy exercising your option you can do two things, either buy the 100 shares and take the profit or sell the contract to buy 100 shares to someone else at a now very elevated premium. \n\nWhat happens with stock splits that may occur? How does that affect it?\n\nAnd am I right in understanding in your above scenario that the contract cost 8975, and now if you exercised it you could sell the contract for $29000?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "All prices are listed at 1%.  So if you check the options price for that particular example it would be listed at $295.50 but everything is multiplied by 100.  So the actual price is $29,550.00.  This is because it represents 100 shares.\n\nYou can sell the option any time, during normal business hours, it does not matter what the stock price is.  This of course assumes there is a buyer.  Tesla is highly traded so there is no issues finding buyers or sellers (at least I have never had an issue).  There is a spread between the bid price and the ask price and you have to offer an attractive price to sell or offer an attractive price to buy when you are doing so, but it is fairly intuitive.  The larger point here is that you can sell anytime, even if it has not reached the strike price.  This is where the IV comes into play.  The higher the IV the greater the option is pumped with excitement and the greater the value.\n\nIf I sell on Monday at 930am EST I may be able to get my 225% profit.  If I wait until it “matures” past one year old, in this case 7/16/2022, the IV may be lower and my waiting to go from short term to long term capital gains was a losing gamble, but if that is the case I still have 9 months to wait out another high IV peak.  \n\nThe IV is quite simple, as the stock goes up so does the IV, down equals down.  If the market is very excited about Tesla’s future the IV goes higher, like right now, and if the market is all doom and gloom it gets crushed.  These ups and downs can be Tesla specific or more Macro, like Fed policy or elections etc…\n\nAs the expiration date approaches the IV matters less and less because the exact price of the option becomes more predictable.\n\nOn the moment of close the call option will be worthless if it It’s strike price is not achieved.\n\nFor every dollar it is above the strike price it is worth $100.00, because it represents 100 shares.\n\nThis is why the break even price was predictable.  \n\nSo there are 2 factors at play: the actual final price and the IV excitement price.\n\nRight now the 1050 call option expiring on 3/17/2023 is worth $29,550.00 because the market is very excited and expects that the stock price will continue to rise over the next 18 months.  \n\nIn fact the market for this option, thinks the stock price will be $1409.50/share on 3/17/2023.  This could be wildly over inflated or way under.  As the date gets closer uncertainty is reduced and the IV is less inaccurate.  As new news is revealed the IV swings up and down in response.\n\nLastly, your question about stock splits is a non issue.  The last 5x split caused my leaps to do the same thing as the stock.  One leap became 5 and the value divided by 5.  I watched closely and calculated like mad, but could detect no loss or gain.  It was perfectly done.  \n\nOf course the split had a huge upward pressure on the IV.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "What? Over? Did you say 'over'?
