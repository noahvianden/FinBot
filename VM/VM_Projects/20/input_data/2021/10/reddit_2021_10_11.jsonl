(Yes, no one knows the answer but I’d love to have some discussion and analysis from you all)\n\nQqq has significantly outperformed SPY/VOO in the last 10 years with around 22% each year while the latter returns with around 16%. \n\nSome believe tech will be still be dominant as they are the future of the world as usual, yet they have too much gains already that some claimed it might slow down in the next 10 years, esp with “overvalued valuation”. While 16% is excellent each year by S and P 500 but didnt perform as well as nasdaq.\n\nYet some believe we will be seeing taper and higher fed rate soon where the cost of borrowing will be higher, thus less creative or world changing companies might appear, which might hit Nasdaq more than us think. Since S and P track more companies than Nasdaq, will it be a better invesment than qqq in the next 10 year? Especially with higher interest rates benefiting financial sectors like banks. And mid-small cap might be more explosive and game changing since companies like Apple or Microsoft are already very big so might we expect the growth to slow down?\n\nI’m trying to pick one of them to DCA into.
