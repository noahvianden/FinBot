{"title": "Update on Paysafe (PSFE)", "selftext": "I‚Äôm just putting in someone else‚Äôs research on here.  I‚Äôm not a huge fan of all of Motley Fool picks but they have some decent analysts that have made me money over the years.  I got into Upstart, Nvidia, Hubspot, and Axon because of their recommendations.  I happen to agree this one so I‚Äôm sharing their info.\n\n‚ÄúThe case for Paysafe\n\nOnline gambling is a growing industry in the U.S. as more states continue to legalize the practice. Paysafe is a key facilitator for online casinos and bookmakers, providing secure payment processing services and digital wallets.\n\nThe company's flagship brands, Skrill and Neteller, are in high demand from some of the largest online gambling providers in the world. Paysafe has a decade-long relationship with European giant Flutter Entertainment, which owns popular platform Pokerstars, and the two companies are now working together in the U.S. through Flutter's Fox Bet sportsbook subsidiary. \n\nPaysafe is active in 15 of the 17 U.S. states where online gambling is legal, and with seven more states set to open up in late 2021 and 2022, the company's market opportunity continues to expand. In Canada, it's No. 1 in the online gambling industry, processing almost 100% of payments across the country. That's only a $2.5 billion market right now, so there's big upside as laws are slowly easing there, too.\n\nThe company's North American iGaming (online gambling) segment grew payment volumes by 72% in the most recent second quarter, far outpacing the rest of its business at 41%. But that's not to say the rest of the business isn't worth talking about.\n\nIn addition to gambling, Paysafe has a growing presence in the online gaming industry. Its partnership with Microsoft now spans 22 countries where it processes payments for in-game purchases made through the Xbox platform. And of course, no payments powerhouse is complete without a cryptocurrency segment -- Paysafe's Skrill digital wallet is used with 30 cryptocurrency exchanges, and offers 37 different tokens for trading.\n\nThe result is $1.54 billion in estimated revenue for fiscal 2021, and with a recent market capitalization of $5.7 billion, Paysafe stock trades at a price-to-sales multiple of 3.7 times.\n\nPaysafe's public listing was met with enthusiasm as it was caught up in the special purpose acquisition company craze of early 2021. Its recent stock price around $8 is a hefty discount to its $19.20 all-time high, and with the company operating in all the right growth areas, this might be a great long-term opportunity. ‚Äú\n\nI‚Äôm really curious what you all think of this one.  They do have some debt but not an unmanageable amount.  I own shares and options.  I‚Äôm up over 100% on the options so already sold enough to cover my costs and playing with house money now but I can see this in the $10-$12 range by the end of the year.", "id": "qam52g", "created_utc": 1634561756.0, "score": 39, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Motley fool is an advertising website not a stock analysis website. \n\nThey will do some form of write up on everyth that exists and use basic API with a little human touch to make it flow.\n\nThen they make money from the clicks...just saying...", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Indeed. \n\nPicking out rough diamonds like nvidia. \n\nThey're definitely ahead of the curve...", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Did motley fool pick Netflix 10 years ago?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Well I don't see Netflix but I can't argue with facts.\n\nIs paysafe in the pay version?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "And avepoint \"jUsT bAcKs Up eMaILs bRo\", I come to reddit for the entertainment these guys provide", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I got a free membership to Stock Adviser and Rule Breakers which are stock picking / analysis areas of motley fool.

{"title": "Netflix Q3 Earnings Estimate", "selftext": "There is currently a lot of talk and hype around Netflix after their blockbuster release of ‚ÄúSquid Games‚Äù. Squid Games has quickly become an international sensation after reaching 111M+ global viewers in more than 200 different countries. Squid games has brought a lot of hype to Netflix (and their original content) and has set the stage for an interesting Q3 2021 earnings report for their stock investors. Today, I am here to predict how Netflix‚Äôs Q3 earnings report will go, and a large part of this will be focusing on the growth of their platform in the past quarter due to their hit show ‚ÄúSquid Games‚Äù. At the end of this analysis, you will find a [NFLX price target](https://utradea.com/positions/NetFlix-Earnings-Prediction-), and how I would play this earnings if my figures are correct.\n\n**Squid Games:**\n\nFirstly, as we know, Squid Games had reached over 111M global users in over 200 countries in the past month alone. This in and of itself is impressive, however factoring in their low production cost of $21.4M makes it exponentially more impressive. Squid Games was able to keep these costs low due to filming in South Korea (Internationally) which allows for actors to work longer hours and can bring the cost of production down. Top executives have predicted that the cost to shoot domestically (in Hollywood) would have been 5-10x more than Netflix‚Äôs cost of production. This series in particular has opened the floodgates for streaming services to shoot internationally, as many of them are now starting to express interest in it.\n\nSquid Games was a huge money maker for Netflix and has been estimated to be worth in the ballpark of $900M, which represents a return on their investment (production) of over 4,100%. Considering Netflix‚Äôs revenues last quarter were $7.3B, Squid Games is likely to represent a large percentage of their revenues in Q3, and since their margins are so impressive, it is likely that we see Squid Games have a role to play in Netflix having better margins on their upcoming earnings.\n\n**Q2 2021 Earnings Report:**\n\nThe most important factor that I derived from Netflix‚Äôs Q2 2021 financial report is the fact that their weighted average subscription price across all of their regions is $12.26. This will be very important in determining the revenues in Q3 2021.\n\nFurthermore, Netflix‚Äôs revenues in Q2 2021 were $7.34B, and their cost of revenues was $4.02B (54.73% of revenues).\n\n***Q3 2021 Earnings Estimate:***\n\n*Revenues:*\n\nI am basing Netflix‚Äôs revenues off of their previous revenues, plus the new revenues that are brought in by additional subscribers in this quarter. \n\nFirstly, to get the new subscriber figures I decided to take Netflix‚Äôs estimate of 3.5M in this quarter for the first 3 months, due to squid games not being added. This resulted in 900k new subscribers per month for the first 3 months, which adds up to 2.7M new subscribers in June, July, and August.\n\nLastly, we needed the new subscribers for the month of September. This was more difficult to calculate as they released Squid Games this month which drove in far more traffic than usual. In order to get a proxy for how many new subscribers a ‚Äúhit‚Äù like Squid Games can bring in, I used the data from Netflix‚Äôs 2nd biggest show ‚ÄúBridgerton.‚Äù Like Squid Games, Bridgerton was released 1 month prior to their earnings report, and helped Netflix to beat their new subscriber estimates by 41%. However, since squid games is 50% more popular than Bridgerton was in their first month, I think it is reasonable to estimate that Squid Games can help Netflix beat their Q3 2021 new subscriber estimates by 61.5%. Increasing Netflix‚Äôs Q3 subscriber figures yield 5.65M new subscribers over the whole quarter. This means that in September, Netflix likely brought in 2.95M new subscribers mostly off of the success of Squid Games.\n\nOverall, if Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers June, their revenue generated for the quarter would be $44.32M (900000\\*$12.26\\*4 months). If Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers in July, their revenues generated for the quarter would be $33.1M (900,000\\*$12.26\\*4 months). If Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers in August, their revenues for the quarter would be $22.07M (900,000\\*$12.26\\*2 months). Lastly, if Netflix brought in 2.95M subscribers in September as a result of Squid Games, their quarterly revenues would be $36.16M. \n\nIn total, it is reasonable to assume Netflix increased their revenues by $136.22M, bringing their Q3 revenues to $7.48B. However, Netflix has been reported to have increased their prices by $1 in many regions. To be conservative, we can assume a $0.50 increase across all regions, which would result in a 4% increase on average prices. This would then cause Netflix‚Äôs quarterly revenues to be 4% higher, totalling $7.78B. This would represent earnings beat of 0.28B (or 3.7%).\n\n*Cost of Revenues:*\n\nAs previously mentioned, Squid Games is very likely to have increased Netflix‚Äôs margins. As a result of this we can conservatively estimate that Netflix‚Äôs cost of revenues is 54% of their revenues (as opposed to 54.73% in Q2 2021). By doing this their cost of revenues should be $4.2B\n\n*Other Costs:*\n\nAssuming that Netflix‚Äôs other costs are the same % of revenues as they were in the previous quarter, we can estimate all of these other expenses to total $1.56B.\n\n*Operating Income:*\n\nIf these assumptions are correct, then Netflix‚Äôs operating income for Q3 2021 should be $2.01B.\n\n*Net Income:*\n\nAssuming Netflix‚Äôs Net Income to Operating Income ratio is the same (over the past 6 months), we can estimate that Netflix‚Äôs Q3 Net Income figure to be $1.25B.\n\n*EPS:*\n\nSince Netflix has 442.6M shares outstanding, their diluted EPS should be $2.74. This would represent a 7% EPS\n\n**Overall Thoughts:**\n\nI think that Netflix is going to narrowly beat earnings, which in theory should be good for the stock. However, since Squid Games was released, the stock has been up 6-7%. As a result, I think that NFLX will not have a big reaction from their earnings. I think that they might open the next trading day (October 20th) up between 0-1% and close the day between -0.5% and +0.5%. \n\nIf I am correct, then the best way that I could think to play this via iron condors. I think that a 600/615/635/650 iron condor would be suitable given [my estimates](https://utradea.com/positions/NetFlix-Earnings-Prediction-). Buying this option would cost $375 which is the maximum downside, and the max profit is $1,125, which represents a 3:1 risk to reward ratio which is good. Furthermore, the probability of profit (based on recent volatility) is 61%. Furthermore, the breakeven prices are $603 and $646. The breakeven price represents my post-earnings price target; however I think that Netflix will stay within the inner range of $615-635, which would yield a credit of $1,125.", "id": "qaoh16", "created_utc": 1634569386.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "you've convinced me to avoid playing netflix earnings. thank you.", "score": 24, "replies": []}, {"body": "Literally nothing matters but their subscriber numbers.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Netflix is collaborating with retarded Youtubers to get views & hits on youtube in my country & that's cringe", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "So... buy puts?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "In my article I mentioned an Iron Condor, which is a neutral strategy where you make money between the spread of the breakeven", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Sounds complicated and I need to stay away from it lol", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "My issue is that this all hinges on an imaginary value attributed to the show by NFLX.
