{"title": "I analyze mentions and sentiment of stocks across social media to find rising stocks! This week's top growing stock and its DD: Vuzix($VUZI)", "selftext": "I had posted the previous picks from my program and my analysis here and the response I received was amazing. I have been working on improving the program and **have made the program public**. If you have seen the previous posts, please feel free to skip to the DD. \n\n**Preamble:** One of the main questions that I had and I see recurring on this sub is how to identify and invest in emerging stocks before it becomes mainstream news. I did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me.\n\n**How does it work:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).\n\nHere is the stock picked by the program and my DD\n\n**Stock: Vuzix Corp ($VUZI)**\n\nWeek on Week increase in mentions: +46.3%\n\nMonth on Month increase in mentions: +1029% \n\nAverage sentiment across mentions: **+34.97%**\n\n**DD**\n\n**Core Product**\n\nVuzix is an American technology firm that mainly focuses on wearable display technology, virtual and augmented reality. One of the major differences between Vuzix and its competitors is that Vuzix focuses on specific niche sectors like healthcare, logistics, service training, etc. and their products are currently being used in the market today. Vuzix is considered a pioneer in wearable computing and augmented reality and has been working in this field since 1997. \n\nThe advancements made in mobile technology and 5G networks have now reached a stage where it enables wearable technology that is not clunky or too intrusive like the Google glasses. Currently, they have 3 products (M400, M4000, and Blade), all of which are targeted towards industrial customers and are currently deployed in the field. \n\n**Financials**\n\nVuzix is not a profitable company and expects to report an operating loss of around $4.4MM for Q4 2020. Their revenue experienced almost a 100% spike from $2MM in Q4’19 to 4MM in Q4’20. Even though the company is not profitable yet, they maintain a great balance sheet. \n\nDebt to Equity ratio is only 0.09 and they have a strong cash position of $52MM (inclusive of converted warrants) which implies they have a long runway to scale and make the unit economics work. They are also currently foraying into a total solutions package that is part hardware and part SaaS to create a recurring revenue model.\n\nOne additional thing to consider here is that there has been consistent insider buying of shares and no selling which indirectly showcases the management’s confidence in the company’s future prospects.\n\n**Potential and Hype Factors**\n\nThe buzz is generated primarily due to the following reasons \n\nCathie Wood’s ARK bought more than 1MM shares of Vuzix in their Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF(ARKQ). According to ARK’s forecast, AR market would grow from $1B today to $130B by 2030 and Vuzix is the leading contender with its long experience and wide IP rights (Vuzix currently has 184 Patents in the AR/VR field). \n\nOne of the other factors which is driving up the demand is pandemic-driven adoption trends. There are strong demands from the field of virtual healthcare and remote training and service calls. Most of their products are back-ordered/out of stock due to the extreme demand.\n\nThey have also fared well at CES 2021 winning 3 awards for their Next Generation Smart Glasses (A smart glass that looks exactly like normal specs). This news should definitely be taken with a healthy dose of skepticism as CES is liberal in giving out awards and Vuzix hasn’t given out their glasses for testing to any reliable tech reviewers.\n\n**Risk and Competition** \n\nThere is definitely significant risk associated with investing in small-cap stocks. The main risk factors for Vuzix that I could see are \n\na. Competition from Big-Tech firms: Almost all the major tech players (Apple, Google, Qualcomm) are in the field/planning to enter the field of AR glasses. While Vuzix owns a considerable number of patents, the best-case scenario for them would be to get acquired by a big tech company as they don’t have the financial backing or supply chain capabilities to take on established companies and successfully deliver on a consumer product.\n\n   b. Unit economics: Vuzix cannot be classified as a startup (they have been around for 23 years) and is still cash flow negative. The company needs to improve its scalability so to generate profits. The current rise in demand due to pandemic might be just the ideal situation for them to scale. \n\nc.  Intel ownership change: 30% of the company was owned by Intel in 2015. As of Mar’21, Intel does not have any ownership in the company. I am not able to find any reliable source of information on why Intel sold their stake in the company. But, on the other hand, there are established funds like BlackRock and ARK buying into the company. \n\n**Conclusion** \n\nAugmented Reality is being touted as one of the megatrends of the next decade. Even though there are significant risks in-terms of widespread acceptance of AR among consumers, established and well-funded competitors, Vuzix with its wide portfolio of products, proven market use case in niche sectors and extensive IP rights puts it in a very strong position for the future.\n\n*Disclaimer: I currently do not own any stock of Vuzix. I am not a financial advisor. There are significant risks associated with investing in small-cap companies.

{"title": "Berkshire Hathaway", "selftext": "This is a time to learn, breathe, watch, and plan. Not a time to act...yet. One suggestion I offer to everyone, and it is something I do myself: I keep about 15% of my portfolio in BRKB at all times. I added tremendously in last year’s ~175 range, and have dealt with questioning and at times outright ridicule as to why I would sideline a significant portion of my portfolio when it has under performed the s&p500 for the last 15 years.\n\nI also keep 10-20% in VOO. Another 40% is spread out among ETFs, and the remainder home run swings. But I want to focus on precisely why Berkshire Hathaway is such a valuable investment vehicle so that many of you can consider it in the future.\n\nNow is not the time to buy. Once all of this blows over and people are back to fetishizing growth, there may be some great entry opportunities. But it should not be looked at as purchasing an individual stock—instead you are buying a mindset toward diversifying amongst value assets. It’s insurance giant that diversifies on a time-tested philosophy and acts as insurance for your portfolio. Since I added back last year it’s up 40%+ and is carrying my portfolio through the turmoil. You don’t even have to own a lot to make it a winner. But when the market acts like this it really makes things easier psychologically.\n\nThere are concerns, of course. Warren isn’t going to live forever, and the company has been hesitant to capitalize on some major opportunities. But I imagine they may make some moves here that we will hear about later on if value presents itself. And the succession plan has been meticulously considered, just as Buffett’s investments are.\n\nBut anyway—plug for a company that is boring and overlooked, but run by guys who get this stuff better than all of us combined.\n\nEdit: Oh to add—I also manage my mom’s portfolio.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 5, 2021.", "selftext": "After falling steeply in the morning, the major indices reversed to finish firmly in the green as market participants digested the Labor Department February Unemployment report, rising Treasury yields, and developments surrounding stimulus. \n\nThe US added back the most jobs in four months in February, as falling coronavirus cases, an increase in the pace of vaccinations, and easing social distancing guidelines are allowing many businesses to reopen. Non-farm payrolls rose by 379,000 in February, or well above the 200,000 expected. The unemployment rate dipped to 6.2%, unexpectedly improving compared to January's 6.3%. The February jobs report also included a notable upward revision to payroll. January’s payroll gain was revised up to 166,000 from the tepid 49,000 previously reported.\n\nIn response to the positive jobs reports, Treasury yields rose once again to hover near its one-year high. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a high of 1.6% today before dipping to 1.557% at the time of writing. As a reminder, high expectations of economic growth causes Treasury yields to rise as the demand for bonds drops in order to make them more attractive. \n\nRising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now.\n\nDuring a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be “patient” in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, “If we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.”\n\nTexas said Tuesday that it was lifting its mask requirement and would allow businesses to fully reopen, the most expansive step by any state to remove coronavirus restrictions as Americans across the country are eager to emerge after a year of isolation in the pandemic. \n\nSenate Democrats struck a last-minute agreement Friday to set federal unemployment benefits at $300 a week, down from the $400 passed by the House, but extend their duration by more than a month as part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, according to a Democratic aide.

I know, I know people trade mostly CSPs and credit spreads are super risky but I am just commited to credit spreads until I make it. Have been doing this with decent success (ofc because it was a huge bull market) but got absolutely thrashed this week. The same happened last September as well but that was the point where I was worse in managing them. \n\nThis week atleast I did roll them pretty early to next week so lets see whats in store.\n\n The stock I pick are a big bag of ETFs (SPY, DIA, IWM, SMH) and some high IV stocks (AMD, NIO, PLTR) and FAANG. I have been sturggling to add decent value stocks which have good liquidity and okayish premium (maybe 10-15% for  0.3 delta 2-3 weeks out). BA, RCL, airlines are good ones. Any others to suggest? Liquidity is high priority than premiums here.\n\n Also wondering what's the stratergy is when this go south this quick (NIO dropped 25% this week, AMD \\~ 10-12%).\n\nRolling helps generally but I doubt this week it will with most of my spreads way ITM. I also learnt the value of early closure even for a loss (not for the first time lol)\n\nMain things I learnt is -\n\n1. ETFs are much better (ETFs are easier to react to) . Having 80-90% success here.\n2. Try to diversify across multiple sectors equally as mentioned above. (was way too tech heavy, mostly because I have a tech bias and watchlist is tech heavy) \n3. Have a 30-70 ratio for PUT to CALL credit spreads. (PUT spreads seem better generally but they are harder to react to in a sharp downturn, call credit spread crawl slower). I did a very bad job here due to being fed constantly of succeeding with PUT spreads.\n\nWould be great to have suggestions and insights from others! \n\nP.S. - Most of this sub seems very biased to only do CCs and CSPs and most of the comments on credit spreads or riskier stuff gets downvoted to oblivion.

First of all man, we all got shit on this week. Even if we used TA and FA to sell at good levels, our stocks still got shit on. Luckily for us, we have time on our side depending on your expiration. This is the first time I've gone through a major correction while selling spreads on non ETF's so I'm no expert. However I've been watching MANY credit spread videos on how to manage a spread gone wrong for the last few months in preparation for this moment and I've feel like I've handled it as well as possible. \n\nThe first thing I did was roll out. I kept the same price for my spreads bc I'm convinced that many of these tech stock drops were overreactions. Stocks like NIO, U, SUNW and others that I'm in dropped way too far way too fast for no reason. Some may argue they're overvalued but a 30% drop will definitely lead to a bounce up. I believe the levels that I sold at will survive when that bounce does occur in those stocks. \n\nSecond, I had some cash in reserve. Unfortunately, I should've had more cash available but hindsight is 20/20. This allowed me to roll down and out for a wider spread. I risk more collateral but collected more premium. If I believe that the stock price will rebound, then this is a risk I should take. I'll end up collecting more premium and more time for my thesis to be right. \n\nThird, I rolled into strength. This means two things: First, I rolled my positions on a green day. This allowed my positions to be OTM and collect credit. It's hard for someone to buy your spreads when they're ITM from my experience. Second, I rolled my spreads out to April which is historically a very strong month in the market. Not only do I have time on my side, I have history on my side. \n\nLastly, I mentioned it earlier but I have cash on the sidelines. If worse comes to worst then I have enough money to but back my spreads for a loss or hit the emergency last ditch button. This is for when you think that the market is completely crashing. What you do is buy back your short leg you sold and ride that long leg all the way down. This well help limit your losses and if we experience a HUGE crash, may even give you profit. That's worst case scenario and I don't expect that to happen anytime soon but it would've been helpful to those in spreads last March. \n\nAnyway, I love spreads and still do. This correction taught me that I need to diversify the sectors I play though. I got caught up in the tech hype and it's killing me. I still think it's fine to play mostly Put Spreads since the market is mostly going up but I should add in some call spreads too. Lastly, I need to have more cash on hand if I want to exclusively do spreads. At least 25% cash but more to 35% especially in times where the market is overbought like it is/was. \n\nI hope we make it out alive so we can make more money and buy some Lamborghini's lol", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Credit spreads are less risky because you know what your maximum loss will be going in.

Short leg IV < 60\n\nUsing this program I was able to generate nice returns in the past couple month. I was able to make 6k to 10k per month using 80k collateral. NVDA/AMZN/FB are winners for me that gave me good spreads for the past couple months.\n\nI also have another program that tracks the delta of the short leg. Once the short leg reaches around 0.7 delta, I would just close it and take the loss. In the past 3 month using this logic I was able to trade with >80% win rate every month, mostly because of the bull run and the Put credit spread was no doubt the winner.\n\nWith that being said, this week I took a serious loss (probably one of the biggest lost in my trading career). I had a bunch of Put credit spreads in expires 3/19 that I believe was able to bounce back but eventually didn't (NVDA/TSLA/ADBE). Instead of rolling out I close all of them for a loss just to get the collateral back so I can buy some Leaps. I lost past 3 month of gains and now my portfolio is back to Thanksgiving last year.\n\nI think OP mentioned some good point - I should not trade explicitly Put credit spreads moving forward, and trade more on the ETF sounds like a good idea.

I have made some significant money with NVDA/AMZN in the past 4 months.\n\nNow, the deadly weakness of Credit Spread is when the market makes a huge move against you. Let's say we sell Credit spread with credit = 1/4 of the width, basically it's a 3:1 risk/reward setup (for every 1 dollar I earn I risk 3 dollars). So this week when the market went against my put credit spread, my loss was tripled so the total damage is significant. \n\nOne of the major lessons I learned this week is that, I did saw a lot of my put credit spreads falls ITM when NASDAQ dumped this week but I refuse to sell because I think Tech will rebound back.

I forgot to keep in mind that how significant the loss can be for this strategy, hence the hard lesson.\n\nInstead of rolling out to prevent the unrealized loss, I actually prefer to close the position, take the loss, get the collateral back, and then put it into Leaps.

The broader market sell-off creates a unique opportunity to buy shares of a company with leading technology and improving financials.\n\nIf you believe in PLTR’s technology I’m not sure why you wouldn’t want to own this stock right now at these levels. This post will focus more on the numbers and less on the technology (which I do believe to be superior but I’ll save that for a different post).\n\nWhen analyzing PLTR on GAAP metrics, the numbers are good, but not fantastic. You must remove 2 things to really get a true grasp of their core business, 1) Q3-20 should be adjusted due to the company incurring much higher than normal costs as they went public and, 2) removing the effects of stock based compensation. When you do this the company’s numbers are actually MUCH stronger than they appear under normal GAAP metrics. From here on, charts labeled “Actual” refer to the actual amounts reported while “Adjusted” refer to those metrics less the effects of stock based comp.\n\n**Revenue/COGS/Gross Profit**: as pictured in the chart revenue is growing very well QoQ and only saw inflated COGS in Q3-20 (when the company went public - this will be a common theme). 📷\n\n[\\(Actual amounts with effects of stock based comp\\)](https://preview.redd.it/7cn1qfs9b9l61.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef4d2f11dbbc0687ac8ea11d040578b7cae84e19)\n\nWhen you remove Stock comp from the mix (as clearly outlined in their 10-K btw) you can see COGS is more in line with its historical trends (see below). You can also see Gross Profit margins improving as well as the company scales (VERY positive).\n\n[\\(COGS in line with historical trend\\)](https://preview.redd.it/07p4f6ucb9l61.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ef26c30a0e81a5e44e59714c675447e2e38618b)\n\n[\\(Quarterly gross margins improving\\)](https://preview.redd.it/pwsjsddkb9l61.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c2a6e3e11194ce84e046dead72e157916dda7f1)\n\nAdditionally, PLTR has expanded both its Revenue from Commercial clients (21.5% YoY) and from Government clients (76.6% YoY) creating a more healthy split of revenue from Commercial to Government to 44.2% and 55.8% respectively.\n\n**Operating Expense:** when you look at Opex you can see expenses ballooned in Q3-20 as the company incurred additional costs of going public, but when you remove those costs, the core business is much more attractive. (see below)\n\n[\\(Inflated Q3-20 expenses due to going public\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ouce2g4nb9l61.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ee86e40c5e643e25d6d5095d8d4c4180f84791e)\n\nWhen you remove stock comp from the mix we see a much more consistent trend of opex:\n\n[\\(Opex after removing effects of stock based comp\\)](https://preview.redd.it/j0ocreipb9l61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=033503ba38429c6ff06b991981cc33cb0cf036e9)\n\nIt's important to note that Revenue increasing and opex staying relatively stable is having a very strong effect on margins. Just look at opex as a % of revenue (see below). Revenue growth is significantly outpacing costs of the core business:\n\n[\\(Adjusted Opex as a &#37; of Revenue\\)](https://preview.redd.it/ncsrlyuqb9l61.png?width=815&format=png&auto=webp&s=07a40f4a2e8ba9dc8a7b83df0ebcb032726f38d8)\n\nPut this all together and you can see how PLTR's core business is looking strong and just over the peak of breaking even on a non-gaap basis:\n\n[\\(Adjusted: Revenue, GP, Inc\\/Loss from Ops, Net Inc\\/Loss\\)](https://preview.redd.it/tfo8934sb9l61.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebb728f2aa1bb91869e26162be87d007acef887c)\n\n**Quarterly EBITDA (see blelow):** Growing EBITDA in absolute terms as well as a % of Revenue.\n\n[\\(EBITDA by Quarter\\)](https://preview.redd.it/t99r92wtb9l61.png?width=956&format=png&auto=webp&s=1830665b9c7078a2d13d74a79dc2389c44a99dbf)\n\n[\\(EBITDA as a &#37; of Revenue\\)](https://preview.redd.it/0td73hevb9l61.png?width=944&format=png&auto=webp&s=363a81c06eb0329f60043c7334229be70ed1d079)\n\nOverall, this company is profitable on a non-gaap basis and is trading an EXTREME discount from its previous highs. Of course rising rates and inflation concerns are something to factor in, but the financials of this company are sound imo and offer a great buying opportunity at this level. If I had spare cash I'd be buying into this weakness.\n\nHappy to hear thoughts from everyone else.", "id": "lyjaf8", "created_utc": 1614971084.0, "score": 101, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "I think something that everyone forgets is that $PLTR software literally SAVES companies money and it has been PROVEN that it does.

PLTR to the moon, I think they will eat the competition alive because consulting firms want to provide “customized” solutions.
