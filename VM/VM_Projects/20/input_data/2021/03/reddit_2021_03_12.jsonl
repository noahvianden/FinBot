Therefore, if it follows the pattern, the new Car's Name will be a whole word, most likely beginning with A. \n\nSo of all the Words with A - why Alpha? \n\nWell for one, Model Alpha suggest that it is the Base-Car, the smallest version(like BMW's X1 or Audi's Q1).\nSecondly Model Alpha can be interpretated as the Number One,the Alpha Male , which would fit, given the likelihood that Tesla will gain significant market share with this Model in Europe and China.

It cherry-picked the most value add to the sellers on the platform. It doesn't get involved in shipping unless it is global, then it uses its own freight forwarding to backout fx, shipping, and custom. This is a big differentiator in the platform and solves the main pain point. But it does not get into the 2-day free shipping etc, as it is logistically convoluted and costly. It also does not alienate sellers or try to compete for their business.\n\nWhat it lacks is an experience for buyers that is as convincing as the seller's side.\n\nAnd I believe that is coming. In the past year, it has improved the buyer's experience with authentication rollout and more curation. It touts more millennials and gen z on the platform, especially in the circular 2nd hand goods.\n\nHere are the specifics;\n\n1, competitive advantage: global\n\nThe big increase during the pandemic because of the access to global supply chains. These customers once on-boarded are actually sticky with similar attributes to the previous cohorts.\n\nThe global reach is enabled by the global dropshipping and freight forwarding program of eBay, which is a pain point of amazon, tmall, etc.\n\nGiven eBay is also ‚Öì split among, us, Europe, and the rest of the world, this will be a meaningful point.\n\n2, capturing the zeitgeist is an opportunity\n\neBay is now methodically rolling out new verticals that capture the zeitgeist. Their current pushes are sneakers and luxury watches. These are high-growth categories. The specifics might fade, but they are constantly searching for new verticals to add.\n\nThere will be new tulips and eBay has been quite able to capture them. This represents a small percentage of GMV but it brings new buyers and sellers onto the platform maintaining market share as well as mind share\n\nThis effort is credible as if there is something you don‚Äôt think you can find anywhere, you will try eBay.
