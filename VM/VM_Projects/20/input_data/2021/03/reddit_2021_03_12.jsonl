Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, March 12, 2021**\n\nStocks traded mixed on Friday, with technology stocks coming under pressure once again as Treasury yields resumed their march forward. The Dow extended gains from yesterday, hitting fresh intraday records. The S&P 500 (SPY) opened in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to finish modestly green.\n\nAfter months of negotiation, President Biden signed into law a new $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package after the bill passed in both houses of Congress by party-line votes. The bill includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The bill comes exactly one year following the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. \n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 10 basis points to reach a fresh, one year high at 1.628%. This marks a rise of around 50 basis points compared to levels from a month ago. Yields are rising in response to inflationary fears and expectations for explosive growth as the economy reopens.  Kit Juckes, Societe Generale macro strategist, wrote in a note to clients, “The pattern seems clear enough: The equity market is seeing a sector rotation but not a correction; the bond market is seeking a new equilibrium in the light of a vastly improved economic outlook in both the U.S. and elsewhere.”\n\nRising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. \n\nIn vaccine news, shares of Novavax (NVAX) jumped 8% on Friday after a final[ analysis of the drugmaker's COVID-19 vaccine trial in the UK showed the inoculation was 96.4% effective ](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-confirms-high-levels-efficacy-against-original-and-0)against the original strain of the coronavirus.

Therefore, if it follows the pattern, the new Car's Name will be a whole word, most likely beginning with A. \n\nSo of all the Words with A - why Alpha? \n\nWell for one, Model Alpha suggest that it is the Base-Car, the smallest version(like BMW's X1 or Audi's Q1).\nSecondly Model Alpha can be interpretated as the Number One,the Alpha Male , which would fit, given the likelihood that Tesla will gain significant market share with this Model in Europe and China.

It doesn't get involved in shipping unless it is global, then it uses its own freight forwarding to backout fx, shipping, and custom.

It also does not alienate sellers or try to compete for their business.\n\nWhat it lacks is an experience for buyers that is as convincing as the seller's side.\n\nAnd I believe that is coming. In the past year, it has improved the buyer's experience with authentication rollout and more curation. It touts more millennials and gen z on the platform, especially in the circular 2nd hand goods.\n\nHere are the specifics;\n\n1, competitive advantage: global\n\nThe big increase during the pandemic because of the access to global supply chains. These customers once on-boarded are actually sticky with similar attributes to the previous cohorts.\n\nThe global reach is enabled by the global dropshipping and freight forwarding program of eBay, which is a pain point of amazon, tmall, etc.\n\nGiven eBay is also ⅓ split among, us, Europe, and the rest of the world, this will be a meaningful point.\n\n2, capturing the zeitgeist is an opportunity\n\neBay is now methodically rolling out new verticals that capture the zeitgeist. Their current pushes are sneakers and luxury watches. These are high-growth categories. The specifics might fade, but they are constantly searching for new verticals to add.\n\nThere will be new tulips and eBay has been quite able to capture them.
