{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 19, 2021", "selftext": "Stocks finished mixed, with the Dow (DIA) falling while the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) recovered from heavy losses yesterday. Market participants continue to focus on rising Treasury yields and the FOMC‚Äôs comments earlier this week. \n\nThe Federal Reserve reiterated its commitment to maintaining interest rates near zero and asset purchase program at a pace of $120 billion per month in place for the foreseeable future, even as the US economy shows signs of gaining momentum thanks to an increase in the pace of vaccination and the recently passed stimulus package.  FOMC members now expect the unemployment rate to dip to 4.5% by the end of this year with an inflation rate of 2.4%. Three months earlier, the Fed expected an unemployment rate to improve to only 5.0% with core personal consumption expenditures rising by just 1.8% by year-end. Real GDP growth will likely come in at 6.5% this year, the Fed projected, up sharply from its previous 4.2% growth forecast. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank would tolerate some overshooting of its inflation and employment targets as the economy makes strides in recovering, and would keep monetary policy loose until more data confirms the economy is back on track.\n\nThe Federal Reserve‚Äôs assessment of the economy helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten restrictions sooner-than-expected. Steve Sosnick, chief strategist of at Interactive Brokers said of the Fed‚Äôs comments, ‚ÄúChairman Powell was pretty adamant, as he had been in front of Congress as well, that he was not really inclined to do anything preemptive about inflation, but react to it if inflation becomes a problem and if we‚Äôre at full employment. We‚Äôre a long way off from that, but the bond market now is getting nervous that we could see inflation becoming a problem before the Fed does anything about it. And that‚Äôs the little bit of a freak out that we had been seeing in bonds, and that continued \\[Thursday\\].‚Äù It‚Äôs important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was 5 years ago. \n\nRising Treasury yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies require a large amount of capital to fund their growth and usually generate most of their earnings years down the line. Higher Treasury yields make it more expensive to borrow capital decreases the value of future cash in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has fallen 0.6% in March to date and is holding onto a year-to-date gain of just 1.8%, after surging by 44% in 2020.\n\nDespite headwinds in the market and the expectation for some volatility in the near-term, given the Fed‚Äôs accommodative monetary stance, the pace of vaccinations, additional fiscal stimulus, strong growth in EPS, and the impending reopening of the economy, our longterm thesis remains bullish\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) dropped after China reportedly banned some state and military personnel from using the company's vehicles over national security concerns, according to reports from outlets including Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal.\n* The [U.S. Federal Reserve announced on Friday](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-to-restore-bank-capital-requirements-as-treasury-markets-130935328.html) that it will not extend a temporary bank leverage ratio exemption past its March 31 expiration date.

{"title": "Vuzix ($VUZI) DD", "selftext": " **Introduction**\n\n‚Äú[Vuzix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuzix) is an American multinational technology firm headquartered in Rochester, New York. Founded in 1997 by Paul Travers, Vuzix is a supplier of wearable display technology, virtual reality and augmented reality. Vuzix manufactures and sells computer display devices and software. Vuzix personal display devices are used for mobile and immersive augmented reality applications, such as 3D gaming, manufacturing training, and military tactical equipment. On January 5, 2015, Intel acquired 30% of Vuzix's stock for $24.8 million \\[but has recently sold their stake as of January 2021\\].‚Äù \n\n**Product**\n\n[Vuzix Blade Upgraded Smart Glasses-](https://www.vuzix.com/products/blade-smart-glasses-upgraded)\n\nThese ANSI Z87.1 certified glasses come in two variants, prescription and non-prescription, for use in manufacturing, construction, and any other scenario where safety glasses are required.\n\nStarting at $800, these glasses have an autofocusing HD camera, stereo speakers in the temples, noise cancelling microphone, color display on the right eye, wifi and bluetooth connectivity, microSD expansion, a touchpad, English and Japanese support, micro USB connection, and full UV protection and safety certification.\n\nThe prescription allows the wearer to not have to rely on contact lenses. All that is needed is your pupillary distance, sphere and cylinder of your eyes, and a copy of a valid prescription with a physician‚Äôs information. \n\nM-Series-\n\nThere are currently three M-Series glasses: M4000, M400, and M300XL. The M-Series is primarily used in warehouse logistics, tele-medicine, manufacturing, and field service.\n\nThe [M400](https://www.vuzix.com/products/m400-smart-glasses) starts at $1,800. These have a full color OLED display, flashlight, 64GB internal storage, wifi and bluetooth, GPS, camera capable of taking 12.8MP photos, 4K30 video, barcode scanning, USB C connection, three noise-cancelling microphones, IP67 rating, drop tested up to 2 meters, and supports six languages, along with support to be mounted on hard hats, headbands, headphones, and safety glasses.\n\nThe [M4000](https://www.vuzix.com/products/m4000-smart-glasses) is the successor to the M400 and carries many of the same features, except uses a DLP display instead of OLED, integrated speakers, drop tested up to 1 meter, and Waveguide optics (which allow for viewing past the ‚Äúscreen‚Äù). These start at $2,500.\n\nThe [M300XL](https://www.vuzix.com/products/m300xl-smart-glasses) starts at only $800 (originally priced at almost $1,100) and are the entry-level smart glasses to the M-Series lineup. It has standard USB connections, a 10MP camera, 1080p24 video, LED display, wifi and bluetooth, speaker, dual noise-cancelling microphones, flashlight, and six languages. \n\n[Vuzix Labs Smart Swim-](https://www.vuzix.com/products/smart-swim)\n\nStarting at only $200, Smart Swim is a HUD for swimmers that provides workout status and information for indoor swimming or open water. They have GPS capabilities, bluetooth, wifi, full-color display, 9 motion sensors, and micro-B USB connection.\n\n[Other AR-](https://ir.vuzix.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings##document-24822-0001558370-21-003001-1)\n\nAccording to the company‚Äôs 10K, they plan to release more AR products by the end of 2021. These new glasses will have increased resolution and FOV, MicroLED displays, and a more powerful computer.\n\n[Accessories-](https://www.vuzix.com/products/accessories)\n\nThere are a myriad of accessories from power banks, mounting options, carrying cases, and photo lenses with prices ranging from $10 to $200.\n\n[Services-](https://www.vuzix.com/vuzix-remote)\n\nVuzix provides a Remote Assist service that allows you to connect to remote experts through the glasses themselves for real time assistance. This is advertised as a way to cut training time and improve fix rates by allowing the user to connect directly to an expert and allows the expert to view exactly what the user is viewing. This service starts at $150 per month for 3 users and scales to $4,000 per month for 200 users. It also includes a 60-day free trial.\n\n[Apps-](https://www.vuzix.com/appstore)\n\nThere are apps, both paid and free, on the Vuzix app store. These apps are developed by both Vuzix themselves and third-parties in an attempt to grow the ecosystem.\n\n[**Financials and Growth**](https://ir.vuzix.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings##document-24822-0001558370-21-003001-1)\n\nAll numbers rounded to two decimals\n\nSales- 73.6% increase\n\n* 2020: $11.58 million\n* 2019: $6.67 million\n\nCost of Sales- 12.9% decrease\n\n* 2020: $9.65 million\n* 2019: $11.08 million\n\nGross Profit- \n\n* 2020: $1.93 million\n* 2019: -$4.41 million\n\nOperating Expenses- 20.7% decrease\n\n* 2020: $21.06 million\n* 2019: $26.57 million\n\nRoughly one-third of operating expenses are attributed to R&D, one-third attributed to General and Administrative, and one-third from Selling and Marketing + Depreciation.\n\nNet Loss- 32.2% decrease\n\n* 2020: $17.95 million\n* 2019: $26.48 million\n\nCommon Stockholder Loss- 29.6% decrease\n\n* 2020: $20.01 million\n* 2019: $28.41 million\n\nEPS- \n\n* 2020: -$0.53\n* 2019: -$0.94\n\n**Competition**\n\nThere are competitors in the field of AR glasses, but none come close to the size that Vuzix has as Vuzix is a field leader. Most competitors sell inferior products (either heavier/thicker, provide inadequate support, or use inferior technology). Vuzix is also a market leader in revenue for AR glasses. \n\nThis is a very niche environment that few have been able to enter, so Vuzix has a strong grasp on future growth.\n\nMore can be read about their competitors on their [10K](https://ir.vuzix.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings##document-24822-0001558370-21-003001-1) beginning at the end of page 9.\n\n[**Management**](https://ir.vuzix.com/corporate-governance/board-of-directors) **and** [**Investors**](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/vuzi#listings_table-sticky-header)\n\nPaul J. Travers, CEO, President, and Director\n\nOriginal founder of Vuzix in 1997 and has served as a board member starting November of the same year. Prior to Vuzix, Travers founded e-Tek Labs (acquired by Belkin in 1999) and Forte Technologies. 30+ years in consumer electronics and 25 years in VR. He also owns roughly 6.2% of the company and is the largest individual shareholder.\n\nGrant Russell, CFO, Executive Vice President, Treasurer, and Director\n\nHas served as CFO since 2000 and as a member of the board since April 2009. Between 1997 to 2004, Russell developed a software firm, computer store and cyber cafe, which he sold. In 1984, he co-founded Advanced Gravis Computer, which became the largest joystick manufacturer with sales of $44 million worldwide. Gravis was listed on the NASDAQ and Toronto Stock Exchange, then, in 1996, it was acquired by a Fortune 100 company.\n\nTimothy Harned, Director\n\nThe newest member of the board having joined in June 2017, Harned has experience in investment banking, corporate development, and financial advisory with 30+ years of experience in mergers and acquisitions. He also has 20+ years of experience in technology fields and 10 years in consumer and industrial companies. Harned‚Äôs resume in financials is in-depth with experience at Lehman Brothers, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley.\n\nState Street Corp owns roughly 4.8 million shares.\n\nVanguard owns roughly 2 million shares.\n\nBlackrock owns roughly 800,000 shares.\n\n**Analysts and Estimates**\n\nVuzi is currently rated a Buy with an average target price of $31.67 (low of $30 and high of $35). An EPS estimate of -$0.27 is given for next year, which would half the current EPS.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VUZI/analysis/\n\n**Risks**\n\nAlthough not likely, they can dilute their shares again if needed. They are currently sitting on over $40 million in cash, so they won‚Äôt need to, but it is definitely a possibility in the future.\n\nAs Vuzix is not a startup and is still cash flow negative by a large margin, they need to improve their scalability and increase profits to be seen as a viable company for future investors.\n\nAs Vuzix has not made a profit, rising interest rates could hurt them when they need to take out loans to maintain business (not likely as they have plenty of cash on hand).\n\n**Technical Analysis**\n\nThis is my own analysis, so take with however much salt you like.\n\nVuzi has been on an explosive uptrend the last few days after having been beaten the past few weeks. They have maintained themselves in the upper BB for quite some time (although it is widening), and their 10 EMA and 20 EMA has held very steadily. The MACD signal line crossed mid-February signalling a buy and it has maintained a healthy divergence. Their recent price action increase has them slightly overbought, but not necessarily a sell (at least not to me). \n\nCurrent support and resistance around $29.50, $25, $23.80, $21, and $19 (although will most likely not be maintained). More realistic support and resistance around $26, $22, $21, $19.50, $18, and $15.50.\n\nAnother thing I noticed is their volume fluctuation on drastic green days vs drastic red days. Drastic green day volume typically has twice the volume of normal and high red days, but red days have a much steeper price change on lower volume. Not sure what to make of that. Maybe people are holding? Maybe the volume is being diluted across multiple days? Not sure.\n\nMy buy range is between $18 and $23 (this does not mean it will reach these prices again, and does not mean it will rebound once it does). My current rating is a hold until (if) it reaches these prices again.\n\n**Final Thoughts/TL;DR**\n\nVuzix is a long-term buy for me, but not at the current price. AR glasses are the future, and I believe they are able to establish themselves in this niche sector. Their products, although not revolutionary, are far beyond the competition and provide excellent ROI for the companies that utilize them. Once they're able to scale up, they will be worth much more than they are now.\n\nI have a current rating of hold until (if) it reaches my buy range of $18-$23 where I plan to buy more. I do believe a pullback from the recent jump is due, but not necessarily guaranteed. I strongly believe in this company and its experienced and well-vested board to increase revenue and push the company into a multi-billion dollar state compared to its current valuation of around $1 billion.\n\nI currently hold 25 shares at $23.50 that I‚Äôve been holding for a month (talk about bad timing) as a means to include it into my portfolio and continuously check the price.", "id": "m8tkm8", "created_utc": 1616194819.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "In at 13... it‚Äôs been a good ride üöÄüöÄ", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Signed up to ark investment trade alerts, it‚Äôs sent daily, they‚Äôve been buying bucket loads since it was at 13 and got in then.

They might use more power, but that will likely become irrelevant as well.\n\nFSD chips don't really give Tesla much of an advantage because their purpose is so binary.

Autonomy isn't an experience, it's a feature. Cars, especially autonomous ones, are not things you interact with. Unlike an iPhone which has a very unique UI/UX that, cars are mainly just for sitting in. Any features that they might have over one another are generally not technological advantages, merely luxuries. You pay a premium for an iPhone not because it's so much better made or faster than a Samsung, you pay it simply because you do A LOT of interacting with the device and that interaction can only be had with an iPhone. You can only get that familiar UI/UX that you like from Apple. They both have cameras and keyboard and cloud storage, but those specific interfaces are unique to Apple products.\n\nConsider this:  \n\nI tell you that Tesla and Rolls Royce have both achieved level 5. I secretly have a driver controlling both though. I put you in each, blindfolded. I ask you to just sit in the backseat and not touch anything. I just tell you to tell it where you want to go. It takes you from A to B.\n\nSo which car was better? Neither. They are both doing the exact same thing. Cars serve such a basic ultimate purpose (A to B), that neither can do one better than the other. It's like electric windows. They both do it, it either has it or it doesn't. Neither rolls windows up or down any better than the other.\n  \nNow let's say I let you take off your blindfold. You still don't know we have someone controlling it. You look around, you feel around, you adjust your seat, etc. Which is which? Easy. You can now tell you're in a Model S or a Phantom.  \n\nWhich do you prefer? Well, which you prefer now largely has nothing to do with technological advantages. RR may have massage seats, but Tesla could implement those if it wants. Tesla may have a video game system built in, and RR could implement that if they wanted. Now what determines which is \"better\" is merely down to what sort of amenities you want and which manufacturer decides to offer them, none of which are technology-bound. Do you want more space? Maybe you need a Sprint Van. Do you want super cheap A to B from 82nd street to 103rd? Maybe you just want Camry now. Do you want a fridge in the arm rest? Maybe you need an S-Class.\n\nSo Tesla quickly loses any advantage once there is feature parity because the \"features\" of FSD are so primitive. It's just A to B transportation. It either does it or it doesn't.  \n\nThis assumes both cars can do the same thing. That may not initially be the case. Tesla may be able to drop you off closer to the entrance, Mercedes may be able to more quickly parallel park.
