{"title": "Building a long portfolio for newer investors and understanding individual sectors.", "selftext": "I have found that the newer traders are the ones that are getting hit hardest the most. I understand why, I've been into stocks for years at this point, and many laughed at my picks in may because I didn't dabble in many of the high flyers or \"meme stocks.\" \n\nWhile I did miss out on gains because of my risk tolerance, instead I have solidified a solid growth and value portfolio that has worked for me throughout covid and even before. Many of the people that make a lot of money quickly in the market, underestimate the difficulty that it actually takes when the market inevitably calms down. This past year was a result of market euphoria and an astronomical amount of greed, which left many who had unrealized gains, with unrealized losses, and they are confused about what to do. \n\nWhen I first started investing, I have seen this scenario and I fell prey a bit. An example that comes to my mind was W.A.TT, a zombie company who spiked to 20$ only to be a worthless stock now. I cut my losses early, but it was lucky I did, because I wasn't knowledgeable to even know why I bought it aside from the point it was vertical. \n\nAfter that, I got smarter and bought nvidia, for around $200 a share, and then when at the end of 2018, the market sputtered and nvidia corrected heavily due to the nature of it's sector. I unknowingly screwed myself out of future gains because I didn't know the financials and didn't read enough, and I bought the RIGHT company, for the wrong reason. I sold for a loss. If I had held that, (and my other speculative, GREAT, buys, my portfolio would've tripled in 3 years. But I didn't understand why the stocks move downward. \n\nThis is long and I apologise, but by doing the wrong things, it's led me to doing the right things, and my portfolio is calm and gaining through covid and through this rotation. When it comes to individual stock picking, you have to treat it like a job and read. Read everything you can. When it comes to market sentiment, it should almost be irrelevant. All stocks will go down, but if you hold stocks that you know won't stay down, you're stress levels will not be as high as someone who jumped into something with no entry or exit strategy. \n\nI will say that this isn't necessarily a guide and I won't give any specifics on how much of anything you should have, but understanding what should be present in a solid, safer growth/value portfolio to avoid losing large chunks of money during cyclical swings and market moves. Losing money is unavoidable in the market at some point, but being in a position to where it won't destroy confidence or your portfolio, is avoidable, and with work very achievable. \n\nA solid base for a portfolio is necessary, and I would say it should almost always include dividend stocks that you are willing to go long on. Safety should be majority of your portfolio, the big blue chips are boring, but they are your anchors, and will let your portfolio breathe naturally on down and up days and mitigate large swings. If youre like me and choose to use margin for leverage, dividends pay for your margin interest as well, but I don't recommend margin to people as it involves larger risk in general. \n\nThe next part Is what helped me during covid so much, you look ahead and start to think of things as a contrarian, and realize that not all of your picks are correct, and you may need to adjust accordingly based on fundamentals. NEVER get attached to a stock, sometimes if you get gains on a speculative pick, you should take them, especially based on the market in late 2020. The rotation was written on the wall. \n\nBanks are safe havens as well, but more fickle, I own many banks but for me, I would not open positions on them now, I have however , since I've owned them, averaged up, which lowers my overall gains, but leaves me with much more room to fall before I have to potentially adjust the position, IF, the fall in price is a reflection of fundamentals.\n\nValue stocks are getting less valuable. When you're building a portfolio, knowing how to find and assess value is important and ultimately up to the individual. A simple thing I do, which many may not agree is, I pick 3 stocks, one risky, one safe, and one moderate. I'll use the examples respectively, beyond meat (risk) , simply good foods (moderate) and kraft heinz. They all are completely different companies with vastly different markets I understand, but they all expose to food space with different amounts is risk in a sector. Now kraft may be a great base to my portfolio, but do I need less risk? Or is my dividend and safety base at a level where I am comfortable? Then I'd evaluate my overall portfolio risk tolerance and see if first of all, any of my picks should even be in my portfolio, and I usually will try and think and discover reasons why they don't, rather than why they should. \n\nTech is something I do not like exposure to majority of the time, i keep it under 10%. But many great growth stocks are tech, but patience and cash are the next part of a portfolio, holding a cash position is important for being able to patiently wait and open riskier positions at a safer price, which in the cyclical nature of say, semiconductors (currently relative), can be hard. Opening a position in a good, healthy TECH, company all at once is not the best move in my opinion. Opening a position with the view that it may go down and will give you exposure and potential to average down, is a good mindset. Tech is a fickle industry and cyclical, and earnings are less important than guidance, unless the market is the way it is now, in which value is stealing the spotlight, imo, providing cheaper/ish entries to tech. \n\nOil will always provide dividends, and by their nature will let you average down. Oil especially, as a regulated business due to opec, you are at the mercy of a business that is not really traded on the free market. Supply and demand will sometimes get so out of synch and provide good buying opportunities. I bought oil early, in may, halliburton , exxon suncor and devon. Contrarian plays last year, but this year's quick in and out fad. It took patience, but I cashed out quite nicely, and still hold some for the dividends. \n\nIndustrials, deserve a part in anyone's portfolio. It goes without saying that this should be a decent chunk of your portfolio, they are cyclical ny nature and may swing based on office encumbants and world issues, but they are the backbone of the world and when you can pick a convicted and tried and true winner, can be of great value and safe , long term growth. \n\nCommodities are commodities and always should have some exposure, these are stocks that I tend to adjust the most, as they face fundamental changes often and are subject to world trade/trends sometimes (clothing). When it comes to food, I tend to pick safer, dividend oriented companies, I try to pick these up only if I see them with great value attached, near all time highs, I tend to wait and watch. \n\nMining stocks are good to go right now, but they are a bit risky, ones with dividends and in relation to precious metals may see a bit of a boom, but that is honestly and industry I don't dabble in much, I have my picks, but due diligence and understanding how they make money is important.\n\nIn my opinion, risk is for chumps, anything over 3% of your portfolio in gamblingesque stocks, is a bit more fugazzi than it is fun, and can lead to impulsive moves of you don't regulate your mindset. Also, this is about portfolios and for newer people who may have had a hard time with this VERY SMALL market move that somehow ruined people's portfolios. Limited risk does not mean limited gain. Unless your a trader. And I'm not, so I'm boring. But I make money, I hope any of this helps. Went on a bit long but I wanted to get into some sectors that have really helped me since before covid, and throughout as well since I was able to recognize the bargains in price. \n\nThe more you watch the numbers, the better you understand the numbers. But don't watch them everyday, or you can become paranoid, be convicted, do research, and whenever buying anything, that behind the stock, it has fundamental value. Even growth stocks that get slashed in half SOMETIMES can be good holds, but you must be prepared to adjust of you're not right.

They provide many thousands of hours of showtime each year with niche focuses such as hobbies and sports, that other competitors such as netflix, amazon prime do not provide. They have a competitive edge in this market and are not just another TV provider.\n\nFurthermore, they were part of a huge sell-off from Archegos who used multiple bank funds and was overleveraged in many positions. After Archegos' positions fell beyond a certain point, it forced the banks to close their positions to make up for the losses that occurred at Archegos. Viacom and Discovery both fell about 50-60% as a result of this making them hugely undervalued and the perfect time to buy the dip and buy the company at a discount.\n\nWhat this ultimately means is that the price of the company fell, but the value for each of them remained the same. Before the crash, they both were growing like crazy as more investors and asset managers wanted to have them in their portfolios. They were announcing great uptake onto their respective streaming services and have done well during Covid. Both were showing promise and investors valued that as can be seen by an increasing price over several months.\n\nIMO now is a great opportunity to get these companies at a great discount after a huge misstep by a big hedge fund and their partner banks.

However, you would probably would be waiting, and sitting on 19k in cash, until close to expiration when the stock will (probably) be assigned to you.  \n\nIf the stock moves against you, you'll still be paying 190 dollars a share.

The intrinsic value of the contract you would sell is about 67 dollars. The extrinsic value of the contract is effectively 0 (no one expects apple to trade at 190). The share price is about 123. You'll collect the 6700 when you sell the option, but you are still obligated to buy the shares at 190. If the shares fall to 120, you are still out 3 dollars a share even considering the premium you received for the contract. If the shares fall more, you lose more. \n\nA more common way to make this trade would be to sell something closer to the money. Selling a put at 120 at 51 DTE, nets you 430 in premium. If it is assigned, great, you wanted to shares anyway, if not then you made ~3.75% on your 12k in 51 days.
