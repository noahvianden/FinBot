You won‚Äôt pay $200, but I wouldn‚Äôt make it a practice of it. This could become a VERY dangerous practice if you were to buy in large volumes on a smaller less active share.

Theoretically there‚Äôs a limit to any share value relative to the underlying equity, growth, implied risk, sentiment, and any other factor.

At $350 a share and around 70m in outstanding shares with ~$6.5bn in revenue GME‚Äôs market cap to revenue ratio was 3.79. As a contrast, Amazon is around $3.1k with around 440 million shares floating (which don‚Äôt rotate as often) and $386.1bn in revenue so a ratio of around 3.526. Effectively GME was more valued than Amazon without any of the intrinsics. When people boast pipe dreams and expectations of $1000+ this is why I found it interesting that people valued a company well beyond that ratio.

{"title": "WMT DD best stock in my portfolio?", "selftext": "\\*disclaimer: this is my first DD... I'm taking time out of my office job to hear thoughts about my analysis.\n\nLooking at my portfolio that I built in the past 4 months, WMT seems like the most undervalued stock.\n\nI am not talking about any get rich quick stocks. Looking at you TSLA, PLTR, NIO, GME. (although I am invested $20k in these stocks and am about 20% down)\n\n# 1. Why it will win in the next few years\n\nThe market volatility is here. We don't know if it's going to stay, but I am unsure about investing heavily in tech. I want a company that can weather the storm. Grocery/food retailer, especially low-cost chain, seems like a great place to invest in since their business model will bring even more customers in challenging times. The $1400 stimie is a boost that will flow into this sector while we move past the pandemic. 'WIN' here doesn't mean doubling stock price in the next few years. 'WIN' is beating the market. My goal is 4%+ annual.\n\n# 2. On-line business model\n\nLet's be frank here. Walmart doesn't have the greatest online presence. They are trying their best with Walmart+, but it's not there yet. Good news is that I don't think their online presence is 'priced-in', which means that the current valuation of the company doesn't account for how big it can actually get. The company still makes great revenue and margin in the space and there's room for growth.\n\n# 3. Current valuation\n\nThe stock is currently down about 10% since the ATH (all time high) in Dec 2020. Not gonna lie, grocery stores did get a boost during the pandemic since a lot of people cooked more meals at home, but look at the 50 day moving average. The stock moved higher faster than anticipated, but it's trending well with the average line in the right direction. In the past 5 years, the stock has dipped below 50-day moving average a very few times.\n\nWhile we are at it, let's look at some of the fundamentals:\n\nPE: 28.14\n\nPS: 0.67\n\nPB: 4.66\n\nThese are some of the lowest number I see in my portfolio right now.\n\n# 4. Is there a bear case?\n\nFrom what I can see, very little. If WMT is down, I am pretty sure the whole market will be down. I also don't foresee them making poor business decisions in the coming future that will cause WMT to inverse the market growth.\n\n# 5. Is there a better alternative?\n\nMaybe Costco? but Walmart fundamentals are better with higher performing chart data. (I own Costco as well).\n\nTLDR: WMT has solid fundamentals, is down 10% for no reason, is seriously undervalued right now, there's no bear case, no rising competition, potential huge growth with online presence, it's a BUY.\n\n\\*not financial advice.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 25, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, March 25, 2021**\n\nStocks rose on Thursday, shaking off three consecutive days of losses in yet another volatile trading session. Market participants continue to monitor recent comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the Treasury yield, and the coronavirus situation in Europe. \n\nIn an interview with NPR's Morning Edition Thursday morning, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done \"gradually over time, and with great transparency.\" This is the latest in a long string of comments from Powell and other monetary officials, like Janet Yellen, that point to the maintenance of accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future. \n\nHowever, despite Powell‚Äôs consistency in his statements, many market participants continue to fear that coming inflationary pressures could cause the Fed to tighten monetary policy earlier than expected. Tim Quinlan, senior economist at Wells Fargo said, ‚ÄúThis will be the first time that every country in the world is emerging from recession simultaneously. And the Fed and other policymakers are banking on this idea that it‚Äôll be a relatively short strain on supply chains but eventually, things get up and running again and you can get the input components to where they‚Äôre most needed.‚Äù \n\nThe 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to hover around 1.6%, falling from 1.75% earlier in the week. Despite the decline, the Treasury yield remains at elevated levels compared to 12 months ago, with the expectation that the yield will continue climbing as the economy reopens and recovers. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, ‚ÄúWe think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in what‚Äôs going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical \\[sectors\\] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve‚Äù. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, it‚Äôs time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.\n\nWe agree, rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. Higher yields make it more expensive to borrow capital. It‚Äôs important to remember that despite rising yields, the benchmark 10-year yield remains at historic lows, roughly half what it was five years ago. \n\nEarlier in the week, German Chancellor Angela Merken announced a new five-day lockdown over Easter. She then extended the measure for a month, citing a rise in coronavirus cases and and a reduction in the availability of ICUs. UK prime minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday said the third wave currently sweeping Europe was likely to \"wash up on our shores.\" Tough new fines to deter international travel were announced on Tuesday.\n\nThe rise in cases comes in tandem with flaring concerns regarding the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Several countries have suspended the distribution of AstraZeneca‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots. Moreover, earlier in the week the, US Data and Safety Monitoring Board said AstraZeneca may have used outdated information in their report and provided an ‚Äúincomplete‚Äù assessment of the efficacy of their vaccine ([Report by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-reputation-missteps-01332124d4c18aba556a53b1a57bcc84)).  In a late-night news release Wednesday, AstraZeneca said it had analyzed more data from that study and concluded the vaccine is 76% effective in preventing symptomatic COVID-19, instead of the 79% it had reported earlier in the week, [insisting the vaccine was ‚Äústrongly effective‚Äù against the virus. ](https://apnews.com/article/astrazeneca-vaccine-strong-protection-us-rift-466726258e5e546550907f123f67763d)\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* First-time unemployment claims fell to 684,000 last week from 781,000 a week earlier.

When AAPL capitulated they signed a five year contract (going off memory here because it's late).  They are very powerful and make money,  lots and lots of money. \n\nRisks, well,  now that all the legal stuff is settled and they have long term contracts and are the undisputed leader in mobile tech, all that is priced in,  why would it do anything other than go up slowly paying a pittance for dividends (was 5% before).  \n\nAlso,  medium term,  IBM could make a better 5G chip (haha), or AAPL could make their own chips ( after the contract expires because they're well-known for making chips haha).\n\nI bought my first set of shares in March of 2015 when their CEO made comments about starting to look at ways to cut costs (this is a normal part of every other business,  but They make too much money to care before that) so the last risk is that they don't have an culture of cost control and the stress is gone.   I held onto a double sized position until after the last earnings call when they didn't raise the dividend.   Dividends impose discipline. \n\nSo yes,QCOM is the best out of the group,  but I'm only keeping it because I want to keep a little exposure to tech.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "All by NET are in SMH.

That'd be 100% ROI yearly to cover your $800. \n\nI do use super short DTE sometimes when it makes sense, but I expect low returns on them, like 0.5% on a few thousand dollars at most. I think selling options are rarely the best choice for a single strategy. I sell CSPs, run condors, credit and debit spreads, long term holds, and CC. It's less finding stocks in the right position to fit your strategy and more using the correct strategy to fit the stock in the position that it's in. Lately I've been looking at dozens of charts a day/week and make maybe 3 or 4 trades total for the whole week, outside of CC against my long positions. \n\nIf you have $10k, I'd honestly take $7500 and put it in some other types of trades and using the $2500 to sell options. I didn't even think about selling CSPs until my account was big enough to take assignment and a 10% loss on that assignment and it just be a bad day. Not saying that you can't or shouldn't.\n\nI still don't touch anything above $150 strike unless deliberately trying to establish a long position. \n\nAlso, good job starting on paper. I still paper trade all the time. No point in practicing something you're not sure about with money. \n\nI'm gonna say it. Why is your car $800/month? That's a bad investment right there.
