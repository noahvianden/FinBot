As seen in the link, 60-odd energy stocks are being added to the fund, at the expense of the existing larger stakes (looking at you, PLUG). \n\n.\n\nWhile NEE is the little darling of the change, SunPower Corporation is on the short list of recommended adds. This is interesting, because SPWR is also on the *other* short list... [the list of highly shorted companies](https://www.highshortinterest.com/). SPWR at the time of this writing is over 22% short floated (GME is 24%), and I show -11% short float from the previous month. I'm surprised it's still this high, because the impending rebalance would buy a lot of shares, raising the price. Price goes up, shorts have to exit, things get squeezy. \n\n.\n\nThis is where I like to hope that some intern at one of these hedge funds is reading this post and going to get his boss. If WSB is aware of the potential squeeze, as well as the potential BlackRock buy, there are $600 million in shorts that need to make their way to the door ASAP. I'm not going to say this is Gamestop... we're not at $5... but the current suppressed price is $29.9, and the 3 week high is $35. Just removing the short pressure could get that back, even without the BlackRock buying. I like to hope just the potential of BlackRock's buy will take it that high, but WSB taking note might have a strong incentive effect on hedge fund rectal clenching and take it higher.\n\n.\n\nFundamentally, SPWR is a semiconductor company, P/E ratio is 8.4 (well below semiconductor industry average 25.2), and profits are in a bit of a slump, which should pick up with the green push by the US Government. My interest is in the good price, the heavy short load, and the potential to squeeze. If Blackrock announces the stock in its ETFs, I expect a very nice rise.\n\n.\n\ntl;dr: SPWR is highly shorted and may join Blackrock ETFs. Hedge funds fear the ape.
