{"title": "My take on why $WISH is a great buy right now", "selftext": " Regardless of your opinion on Wish's products, shipping times etc., $15-16 (ticker price right now) for an ecommerce marketplace consistently in the top 10 in the app store + with billions in revenue is a steal. Wish is a baby, and if it follows the trajectory of marketplaces like Aliexpress, Amazon etc., people are gonna look back on this price like it was a joke.\n\nI'm also saying this as a merchant on the Wish marketplace making a substantial amount of money - they're making **BIG** changes to try and improve delivery times + quality assurance. For example, they recently launched 2 programs:\n\n1. **Wish Express** (like amazon prime)\n2. **Warehouses** \\- they are building warehouses in China to collect orders and ship them out first class to international customers. They're focusing HEAVILY on the US, but they also have a huge amount of buyers from low income areas like Brazil, Chile, Lithuania etc.\n3. They're pushing merchants to meet a **15 day shipping time** (and they're doing it via fines if you don't meet that threshold). This addresses one of the biggest complaints about Wish for US customers - slow shipping b/c most merchants are selling / dropshipping from China. Although other countries (brazil, chile etc.) don't complain about longer shipping times because they haven't been exposed to Amazon Prime like the West, this improves experience for US customers.\n\nThey've also gone on an engineering spree, revamping everything about the merchant backend. \n\nEven though they've gone down since IPO, I still think this is a great bet (I mainly say this as a seller). I put in a bunch in there and I expect it to go up.
