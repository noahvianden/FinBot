{"title": "Another post about first full month of theta gang - results and thoughts", "selftext": "March was the first full month of giving theta gang a try and it was a resounding success with around $52k in CSP/CC profit. My main strategies were the following:\n\n* Figure out a way to use cash that was basically just sitting there, and see if there was a way to juice the returns on the stocks I already owned.\n* In general, be very conservative.\n* Only sell covered calls decently OTM (unless I wanted to exit a position)\n* Only sell CSP decently OTM (unless I wanted to enter a position)\n* DTE is typically between 5 to 45 days\n* Go for lots of little wins\n* Careful on selling puts where I already own stock as it's a double negative if the stock falls past the put strike price. I'm then losing money on the stock I already own \\*plus\\* the puts.\n* Keep a close eye on risk management. Mostly that means making sure to keep concentration on an individual position low - and make sure I don't have too many puts out there in the case of a black swan event.\n* To keep emotion out of it, make sure each position is minor enough so that if it goes negative, I can think clearly instead of panicking.\n* With the range I was selling OTM, even the mid feb / early march tech fall didn't hurt very much. I was encroaching on my strike prices, which was perfectly acceptable. Note that had the fall continued with the same speed it had been going, I would have started taking losses with a delta near 1 since my puts would have been exercised.\n* Since no leverage is being used, there's no chance of my account being wiped out. This carries less of a risk than just buying the stock, with a cushion of typically 5%-10% stock price movement built in before losses even begin to start.\n* Note that in the list below, I filtered to show only the closed options. There were significant realized stock gains as well, but those weren't really related to theta.\n* Also, in the list below, two of the option trades were a high risk / high reward play on tesla during the tech crash. So, the two marked in red totaling around $15k in profit should be \\*excluded\\* from the total gains shown below.
