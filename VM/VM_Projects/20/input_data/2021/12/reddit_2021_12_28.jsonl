{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, December 28, 2021. Please enjoy!", "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 28, 2021**\n\nAfter four positive sessions and a new record high yesterday, the S&P 500 (SPY) took a breather with tech stocks cooling down  in a very choppy trading session. Market participants continue to weigh surging coronavirus cases throughout the world thanks to the highly contagious Omicron variant. \n\n**Notable Numbers:** \n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): -0.08%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.46%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.29%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.61%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -0.79%\n* Krispy Kreme (DNUT): +10.85%\n* Allbirds (BIRD): -11.39%\n* Lucid Motors (LCID): -4.3%\n\nOn Monday, global COVID-19 cases hit a daily record, with more than 1.44 million infections reported worldwide.  Infections from the highly-transmissible Omicron variant — found to spread 70 times faster than previous strains — comprised much of the newly tracked cases. \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue)\n\nHowever, it is very important to note that Omicron has so far been a lot less severe compared to coronavirus strains. three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains. \n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html)\n\nFor context, more than 69,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19 on Christmas Eve, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. This represents an increase of around 2% compared to last week. While unfortunate, the figure remains below peak hospitalizations during the Delta surge and is half of the record-high from January, despite infections surging more than 50% in the month of December\n\n[https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization)\n\nIn light of Omicron’s lessened severity, the Center for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. \n\nData shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission \"occurs early in the course of illness,\" the CDC explained — generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.\n\n\"Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,\" the CDC said in a statement.\n\n[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html)\\\\\n\nThe S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index showed prices for homes in the US continue to moderate for the third straight month, though numbers remain very elevated. The index, which tracks average home prices in metropolitan areas posted a 19.1% annual gain in October, down from 19.7% from September. The 20-City Composite posted an 18.4% annual gain, down from 19.1% a month earlier. The 20-City results came in very close to analysts’ expectations of an 18.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-slowed-in-october-11640700007](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-home-price-growth-slowed-in-october-11640700007)\n\nThe rest of the week is expected to be mostly quiet for investors, with trading volumes low and little economic data and earnings releases.\n\nLooking ahead, the market will head into 2022 with  two key considerations to weigh: the course the pandemic takes and rising inflationary pressures and the Fed’s reaction to such pressures.\n\n**Highlights** \n\n* U.S. President Joe Biden is considering Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve as vice chairwoman of supervision at the Federal Reserve, according to a Wall Street Journal Report.\n* Fortinet (FTNT) a cybersecurity stock, was the best performing tech stock in the S&P 500, rising roughly 150% year-to-date.\n* A U.S. judge dismissed a lawsuit accusing Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn of inflating the number of people who watched video ads so the networking platform could overcharge hundreds of thousands of advertisers.\n* US reality star Paris Hilton launches a new metaverse business, called “Paris World’, on Roblox (RBLX). While I’m a proponent of the metaverse, it’s not surprising to see people trying to cash in on the hype. \n* For the first time since 2016, the S&P 500 is set to outperform the Nasdaq this year. As of yesterday’s close, the S&P 500 is up roughly 28% this year compared to Nasdaq’s 23%. This underscores the rotation out of tech witnessed in 2021.\n* Elon Musk is drawing anger from Chinese officials after the country submitted a complaint to the UN’s space agency alleging China’s space station Tiangong, which is currently being constructed in lower atmosphere, was forced to take evasive action to avoid collision with two SpaceX satellites\n* The new Spiderman movie ‘No Way Home’ has absolutely demolished box office records this year, already grossing more than $1 billion since its Dec 17 theatrical release, selling more than double the tickets as the runner-up.

Below what Dan Ive said again.\n\n  \nTesla “is clearly in a strong position by 2022,” according to analysts at Wedbush, who see three catalysts, including Chinese demand, driving the stock up.  \nWedbush has a current base price target on Tesla shares (ticker: TSLA) of $ 1,400 and a bullish target of $ 1,800. Wedbush analysts, led by Dan Ives, wrote in a note that they are maintaining their outperformance rating on the stock.  \nTesla closed at $ 1,093.94 on Monday, up 2.52%. The stock gained 55% in 2021, and its market capitalization topped $ 1,000 billion. Shares rose 1.3% to $ 1,107.69 in pre-market on Tuesday.  \nIves said the “backbone of the overall bullish thesis on Tesla remains China,” and he estimated the country will account for 40% of the electric vehicle maker’s shipments in 2022. He also said China is worth $ 400 per action at Tesla next year. .  \nThe analyst said Tesla has a “high class issue of higher demand than supply” and said the key to alleviating those issues centers on Gigafactory openings in Austin, Texas and Berlin that “will alleviate production bottlenecks for Tesla around the world “.  \n“We believe that by the end of 2022, Tesla will have the aggregate capacity of around 2 million units per year, up from around 1 million today,” Ives said.  \nThe electric vehicle maker is also expected to be able to address supply chain issues that have held back the overall growth of Tesla units in 2021, according to Ives.  \n“Although the logistical hurdles will represent a financial burden in the short term, we mainly believe that Tesla has the potential to further expand its automotive offering. \\[gross margin\\] and the profitability profile over the next 12-18 months, especially with more higher-margin cars sold and produced in China, ”Ives added.  \nWrite to Joe Woelfel at joseph.woelfel@barrons.com", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "The part where he suggests logistical burdens represent a financial burden in the short term goes to show that some analysts just don’t ‘get it’.

That's an entirely different segment than the broad auto market including ICE vehicles. The only relatable component is they are both automotives. The difference in profitability, structure, environment, innovation is entirely different. Again, the largest cost in an EV vehicle is almost always the battery. That battery is peanuts in an ICE vehicle... So how can you even compare an EV sold to an ICE sold? To ignore that EV is a completely different category in-itself is evident when you consider that GM, Volkswagen, Ford, etc., are planning to spend over $30 billion on EV development in the next decade... Tesla did all the legwork while these legacy automakers were jerking off to their ICE profits and sat idle while Tesla proved EV's were sustainable. How do you just ignore that legwork that Tesla did and add zero value to that?\n\nThe #1 red flag when someone criticizes Tesla's low total vehicle sales with total ICE sales is when they ignore this basic fact. Right now, and correct me if I am wrong, there isn't a profitable EV maker out right now other than Tesla. If they were, I guarantee you Ford, GM, and other auto companies would be publishing separate EV numbers to highlight their profitability. These vehicles are operating at a loss for the manufacturer and the only reason they are pumping them out is because they know that if they don't, interest in their company will wane and they will lose future customers. They are desperate. When the CEO of GM blatantly lies about how GM is the leader of EV's, you know there is something wrong. Same GM that had to put their Chevy Bolt on hold until next January 2022? LOL.... What a leader they are. NIO, Li Auto, and XPENG aren't even profitable.\n\nI'm thinking it is VERY possible for Tesla to become a $2,000 per share stock within the next 18 months. Margins are going to climb higher especially with the development of their 4680 cells and the new stamping being used for a 1-2 piece chassis. Once their factories are operating, reducing the transportation and tariffs to the European counterpart should provide much needed exposure for Tesla to dominate Europe. Consider that Model 3 was the best selling vehicle in Europe for September in both ICE/EV categories with the Model Y being the second best selling EV in Europe in that same month. I haven't checked the other months but Tesla has difficulties getting EV's into Europe because they are mostly already depleting their inventory in China as it is. Makes less financial sense for them to transport that vehicle all the way to Europe where it is lower margined other than Tesla wants to satisfy their customer deliveries in that region.\n\nThe next two years will be filled with insane developments.
