In addition, Powell told a Senate Banking Committee that it is past time to abandon the term \"transitory\" to describe inflation. The S&P 500 fell nearly 2%, while the CBOE volatility index posted its biggest monthly gain since February 2020.\n* According to money markets, a rate tightening of 55 basis points, or more than two standard quarter-point increases, is now priced in by the end of 2022. This is an increase from around 50 basis points on Monday. The first full hike is still scheduled for July. Fed officials have repeatedly stated that they want to complete the taper before raising borrowing costs from near zero, where they have remained since the pandemic began.\n* In his opening remarks, Powell stated that the recent increase in COVID-19 cases, as well as the emergence of the Omicron strain, pose \"downside risks to employment and economic activity, as well as increased uncertainty for inflation.\" During the question-and-answer session that followed, he focused on the evidence of higher prices since officials met on November 2nd-3rd.\n* Concerns about the effects of Omicron weighed on markets earlier Tuesday, with Moderna executives claiming that the numerous mutations indicate that new shots will be required. According to the CEO of BioNTech, the current generation of vaccines will most likely protect against severe disease in people infected with the variant. According to the University of Oxford, there is no evidence that existing shots will not provide some protection against the strain.\n* Consumer confidence in the United States fell to a nine-month low in November, as a rise in COVID-19 cases and accelerating inflation weighed on Americans' views of the economy. Final sales for Cyber Monday fell short of expectations due to a lack of inventory, which kept shoppers from using their credit cards at the start of the holiday shopping season.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rnfecjbrgu281.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a1dcc641cc172fd057462ff9c5e1cec749d769e\n\n[🕵️‍♂️ 🦃 I SPY TA - Monday Nov. 29, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/r3fvym/i_spy_ta_monday_nov_29_2021/)\n\n## SPY - Recap - Nov. 30\n\n## Price Action\n\n* *Open: 462.00*\n* *High: 464.03*\n* *Low: 455.30*\n* *Close: 455.56*\n* *Volume: 133,080,660*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0h5gaa7vgu281.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=c776c48cb306501681b2b9ff1b0135604011b1d7\n\n# SPY - Dec. 1 - Analysis\n\n## Options Data\n\n*Volume totals reflect options traded during the current session (11/30)*\n\n* Put Volume Total: 1,517,387 **(26.6% decrease from yesterday)**\n* Call Volume Total: 1,876,179 **(3.2% decrease from yesterday)**\n* Put/Call Volume Ratio: 0.81 **(24.22% decrease from yesterday)**\n* Put Open Interest Total: 11,645,013 **(1.99% decrease from yesterday)**\n* Call Open Interest Total: 6,675,834 **(5.88% increase from yesterday)**\n* Put/Call Open Interest Ratio: 1.74 **(7.44% increase from yesterday)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pb9vuxwgu281.png?width=1157&format=png&auto=webp&s=24c009771e721ce342c20a50420b585455cf4baa\n\n* 12/01\n* IV: 21.79\n* Dvol: 1.37\n* 449.63 - 462.15\n* Key: 455\n* Crossover: 463\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lzbx9m3zgu281.png?width=735&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ca351166e07b605edc629044f2d18748b3a3d0c\n\n# Technical Analysis - 65 min\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tf7ucp01hu281.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e9fc2c63b14c41e5c94338aa57f4eccea984f35\n\n* Support : 455.50\n* Pivot: 463.40\n* Resistance - 468.77\n* Bullish Targets: 471.21 - 473.70 - 475.81 - 479.23\n* Bearish Targets: 453.35 - 450.41 - 447.71 - 443.73\n* Resistance at 9 SMMA\n* Bearish under 462\n* Neutral at 463-465\n* Bullish at 466+\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p73ugci2hu281.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=6699fe996f9c698877f80414f9fa66ec17dff854\n\n## RSI - 65 min.\n\n* Bears want to 26.83-\n* Bulls want to see 56.89 - 63.65+\n* RSI favors Bears\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ytj8k114hu281.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=848f272a576c277b12a663c650d748664d5effd5\n\n## MACD - 65 min.\n\n* Bearish cross\n* Bears looking to extend\n* Bears looking for -2.90\n* Bulls looking for to keep it above -1.13\n* Watch curl beginning to form for reversal to upside\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r9vxxun5hu281.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=d14a115812bdadb5a79078405867b8e4cfcdddf3\n\n# SPY - Dec. 31, 2021 - The Month Ahead\n\n* Range: 470.07 - 462.22\n* Pivot: 453.96\n* Bullish Targets: 481/60 - 488.27 - 496.41 - 503.71\n* Bearish Targets: 448.62 - 437.28 - 428.32\n* Nearing pivot\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/69tdr098hu281.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5719cae4350522617a3e1ba0c0537cb92b6fd89\n\n## RSI - 1 Day\n\n* Under 50\n* Bulls need 53.80 - 58.76\n* Bears need 33.05\n* RSI favors Bears\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oblwwvp9hu281.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6177c79cf1ff13413af4e7904afb8e96b0e290e\n\n## MACD - 1 Day\n\n* Bearish cross (11/16) and extension\n* MACD favors Bears\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/laqa3l9bhu281.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=f75897c52a20c4628efe4afe8f1e8ad428ecd3c5\n\nWeekly Chart Update - [Highlighted in prior post](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/r3fvym/i_spy_ta_monday_nov_29_2021/)\n\nCurrently at 451.01 or 1% away from today’s closing price (455.56)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mlq8xgfhu281.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=a52a6365fec9456996acd385497032d94ae9788a\n\n## SMMA Chart - 1 Day\n\n* Looking at downside risk similar to Sept. if we close under 30 SMMA\n* If the 30 SMMA (454.44) doesn’t hold we may find support at the 50 and 60 SMMA (446.98 & 443.17)\n* Keep an eye out in the next few weeks.\n* Keep an eye out in the next few days for a 20 SMMA test as resistance.

{"title": "(12/1) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News", "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to the first trading day of December! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Wednesday, December 1st, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [Stock futures jump ahead of first trading day of December after omicron fears dent markets](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/30/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)\n\n*****\n> U.S. stock futures were higher in early trading Wednesday, as companies that benefit from the economic reopening gained along with big energy and pharma.\n*****\n> Dow futures rose 305 points. S&P 500 futures gained 1.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.4%.\n*****\n> The gains follow a Tuesday sell-off on Wall Street over fears about the new omicron Covid variant and the Federal Reserve mulling a quicker-than-planned exit from its easy monetary policy.\n*****\n> Treasury yields also moved notably higher, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently back near 1.5% after falling 8 basis points Tuesday to 1.45% on fears that the pandemic would stifle economic growth.\n*****\n> Merck led gainers on the S&P 500, rising 4% in premarket trading a day after its Covid treatment pill received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, though by a narrow 13-10 margin.\n*****\n> Energy shares also posted sharp gains, with Occidental Petroleum up 3.4% as West Texas Intermediate prices climbed more than 4% to nearly $69 a barrel.\n*****\n> Elsewhere in early trading, stocks associated with the economic reopening also posted strong gains. Carnival was up 2.9%, Wynn Resorts gained 2.6% and Hilton Worldwide saw a 2.8% gain.\n*****\n> The moves came a day after the Dow lost more than 650 points, the S&P 500 shed 1.9% and the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite dipped 1.6%. The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 tumbled 1.9% as cyclical names dragged on the markets.\n*****\n> “Our sense is that the recent selloff is a longer-term buying opportunity. However, investors that want to avoid a potential big drawdown (while giving up some potential upside) may want to wait until the [Fed’s] Dec. 15 meeting,” Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek said in a note to clients.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell jolted markets after he said the central bank is expected to discuss speeding up the taper of its minimum $120 billion a month bond-buying program. Despite the potential disruption of omicron, the Fed chief said he thinks reducing the pace of monthly bond buys can move quicker than the $15 billion-a-month schedule announced earlier this month.\n*****\n> “At this point, the economy is very strong and inflationary pressures are higher, and it is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases ... perhaps a few months sooner,” Powell said. “I expect that we will discuss that at our upcoming meeting.”\n*****\n> Goldman Sachs said it projects the Fed will double the pace to $30 billion a month and enact its first rate hike of the pandemic era in June.\n*****\n> The major averages have seen several volatile sessions, starting last Friday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced its worst day since October 2020. Stocks rebounded on Monday, only to turn downward again on Tuesday.\n*****\n> Wednesday marks the first trading day of the final month of 2021.\n*****\n> Expediting the removal of the Fed’s easy policies tells investors that the central bank is focusing on addressing inflation, instead of new threats from the pandemic.\n*****\n> “Markets appear to be having trouble digesting the combo of elevated uncertainty around the impact of the Omicron variant and a hawkish Fed pivot in the context of persistently elevated inflation,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics.\n*****\n> The new Covid variant, first detected in South Africa, has now been identified in more than a dozen countries, causing many to restrict travel. Denting sentiment on Tuesday, the Moderna CEO told the Financial Times that he expects existing vaccines to be less effective against the new variant.\n*****\n> Stocks wrapped up a volatile month of trading on Tuesday. The Dow lost 3.7% for its second month of losses in three. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25% in November. The Russell 2000 shed 4.3% in November, its worst month since March 2020.\n*****\n> Still, the major averages are up solidly for the year. The Dow is up 12.7% and the S&P 500 is up 21.6% in 2021. The Nasdaq Composite is up an impressive 20.6% this year.\n*****\n> ADP’s private payroll data for November showed 534,000 jobs added in November, above expectations of 506,000\n*****\n> On Wednesday, investors will be evaluating updates on the omicron variant, as well as some key economic reports. November’s Manufacturing PMI, ISM Manufacturing print and October’s construction spending are set to release on Wednesday morning.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/8Kedb0c.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CZnVYrP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/XAbNcjb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/Jml9Z5I.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/5KwRD2M.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/5ocvp67.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/lCtopUt.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/o7ET4fR.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/odyatZm.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/rIUTfTU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/X0CaSOZ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/paTa9DS.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/6LhmSMe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/NQh0VqW.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/lNszsgs.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/TQK2vhS.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/kZvQYzi.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #5!](https://i.imgur.com/m6LPOsg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-salesforce-allbirds-doordash-and-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Salesforce** — Shares of the software giant dropped more than 6% in premarket trading despite a better-than-expected third-quarter earnings report.
