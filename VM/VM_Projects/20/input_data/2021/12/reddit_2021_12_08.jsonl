The Nasdaq 100 index increased by 3%, an etf that tracks newly public companies increased by 5%, and small caps increased by 2%. The S&P 500 recovered all of the losses suffered following Jerome Powell's hawkish stance a week ago, and was only 0.3% lower than its previous close before the Omicron variant shook markets.\n* The CBOE volatility index fell five points to 22. In New York, the dollar fell and crude oil rose above $71 per barrel.\n* Risk assets are recovering this week after preliminary data showed that the surge in omicron cases has not overwhelmed hospitals and China moved to expand economic support. A Goldman Sachs group basket of non-profitable technology firms rose nearly 6% on Tuesday, recouping nearly half of last week's losses.\n* In terms of data, the US trade deficit shrank, while third-quarter productivity fell. Private consumption was the most important driver of the eurozone's most recent economic expansion.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qcc7yhqw28481.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=af278ef0a6b8690883ee0777e25d70e25a2e5773\n\n[🕵️‍♂️ I SPY TA - Monday Dec. 6, 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/r91zcs/i_spy_ta_monday_dec_6_2021/)\n\n## Price Action\n\n* *Open: 464.41*\n* *High: 468.87*\n* *Low: 458.65*\n* *Close: 468.28*\n* *Volume: 92,791,625*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1xh8smu038481.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=7305da0c71504e02cc32ddb6cf3c80d6f53883a9\n\n# SPY - Dec. 8 - Analysis\n\n## Options Data\n\n*Volume totals reflect options traded during the current session (12/7)*\n\n* Put Volume Total: 2,264,268 **(5.22% increase from yesterday)**\n* Call Volume Total: 1,615,257 **(1.56% increase from yesterday)**\n* Put/Call Volume Ratio: 1.40 **(3.70% increase from yesterday)**\n* Put Open Interest Total: 12,478,017 **(3.06% decrease from yesterday)**\n* Call Open Interest Total: 6,758,349 **(3.87% decrease from yesterday)**\n* Put/Call Open Interest Ratio: 1.85 **(1.09% increase from yesterday)**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hv5mqxh238481.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=2aaf11595ef767eb60a8838a6b4dffeb8b4cd001\n\n12/08  \nIV: 16.05  \nDvol: 1.01  \n463.42 - 472.88  \nKey: 465  \nCrossover: 458\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mmcg600438481.png?width=964&format=png&auto=webp&s=68f442399a0d94bca8db4c0fc23f90582b99ee78\n\n# Technical Analysis - 65 min\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l8g07n4638481.png?width=1388&format=png&auto=webp&s=c31d62a5c751c3c8e2aa62d18569c1bbb20d7b6d\n\n#### Commentary:\n\n* Nice run today from the Bulls.\n* I still maintain that we will see a Christmas rally if Bulls hold 462.\n* Depending on futures 469.71 - 468.69 may act as support or resistance (pointed out on gap analysis chart)\n* Best case for Bulls tomorrow is they establish and hold support at 469.71 - 468.69 for more upside.\n* Base case for Bears is they fill all of the gap (463.68 - 460.59 - 459.15) tomorrow as quickly as possible.\n* **Expecting a dip tomorrow - look for gap fill to hold**\n\n#### Levels:\n\n* Micro support: 466.09\n* Gap fill: 463.68 - 460.59 - 459.15 \\*Please note that we could find support at these levels)\n* Pivot: 469.19, 456.45\n* Resistance - 473.95\n* Bullish Targets: 477.43 - 481.50 - 484.54\n* Bearish Targets: 456.45 pivot - 450.92 - 447.69 - 443.43\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59m61w6g38481.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cb3e56ead6bebac6916da11c6c9eba456cece6d\n\n## RSI - 65 min.\n\n* Overbought\n* Bears want to 47.10- 33.91\n* Bulls want to see 77.29 - 91.49\n* RSI favors bulls.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/31qwgath38481.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=d79b151a8271d29695bf4f3cf635afcef0166b34\n\n## MACD - 65 min.\n\n* Bulls looking to extend\n* Slight weakness into close but MACD still favors Bulls\n* Bulls want 3.92+\n* Bears want -1.13\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8sp4sqvj38481.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba2618df7b9e6b2f2c7a9f03a4f4f613f85f7b2f\n\n## Gap Analysis - 65 min\n\n* Bulls filled gap from 11/30\n* Bulls nearly filled gap from 11/26\n* If we gap down on futures tomorrow - 469.71 - 468.69 may act as resistance.\n* If we gap up and hold 469.71 - 468.69 we may test 473 tomorrow.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kwfvqfnl38481.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d435a6c12a34316169447d9756cf0811973c6db\n\n# SPY - Dec. 31, 2021 - The Month Ahead\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tgdfq39o38481.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b09b107acd8db943aa74903864155160133c046\n\n[Old Chart](https://preview.redd.it/cley7jh3l8381.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e884d5cf8b53ab4c9225cf2b7b87039b6e5ead2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Support: 448.11\n* Micro Pivot: 457.57\n* Resistance: 470.90\n* Micro Resistance: 462.36\n* Bullish Targets: 481.60 - 488.27 - 496.41 - 503.71\n* Bearish Targets: 443.3.62 - 437.28 - 428.32 - 419.24\n* Currently above Micro Pivot\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/27uayw8r38481.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1f2bd1f95cf4eb67145a4657b0006e9b74aeb94\n\n## RSI - 1 Day\n\n* Bulls need 58.76+ for breakout of downtrend.\n* Bears need 33.05 (sept. low on RSI) - 28.54 - 19.71\n* RSI is bullish\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hdwi7uzs38481.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1a3e1fe4556f1f338277334094da2a4a9066d08\n\n## Need to Know Market Risk - Financial Juice\n\n* Congress is considering lifting the debt ceiling by $2 trillion. - CNBC\n* The US will ask Germany to halt the NS2 project as a response to Russian aggression. - Source.\n* As of 09:00 ET on Tuesday, no Evergrande bondholders had received delayed coupon payments on the November 2022 and November 2023 notes. - Source.\n* US Treasury Secretary Yellen: Some shortages likely to take a few years to solve.\n\nThanks for reading,\n\n🌝NightMan", "id": "rbf9um", "created_utc": 1638927660.0, "score": 117, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you.

{"title": "Looking for some feedback on an application I have been building <3", "selftext": "Hey all, I’d love to get some feedback on an application I am building. I posted a while back on some early prototypes of what I've been poking at off and on for the past year or so but recently I have been spending a lot more time working on it with the goal of having a commercial offering. However, before I go too far and invest too much effort in that idea I had hoped to gather a bit of feedback regarding its current state. \n\nThe elevator pitch is effectively that it’s a desktop application for doing market research. It pulls data from free resources (so you wouldn’t need to pay extra to get data feeds) but also has the ability to ingest data from a number of subscription services (namely Tiingo and FMP since I use them). If you have an account with FMP, for example, and supply an API key, then the quarterly report data will be much more organized than if you use the SEC data that is pulled down (because… the SEC) but you can still have usable quarterly reports data without paying for FMP.\n\nFor data nerds, everything is stored in a database so it is accessible if you want to pull data out yourself. By default data is stored using SQLite but for those folks who want to run their own database, such as Postgres, it supports that too. In addition it has a minimal-but-growing HTTP API for extracting data as CSV or JSON. This makes it easy to write some R or Python externally but not have to fight with downloading data and unstructured garbage (it's done that for you already!)\n\nI have attached a few screenshots to go with this post but as of right now the feature set it has, which I use daily, is the following:\n\n* Newsfeed ingestion\n   * Pulls down all content from the web and then presents it in textual form by extracting content using NLP\n   * Extracts ticker symbols (using a combination of fuzzy matching and straight matches — i.e will treat “Microsoft” and “MSFT” in any given article as mapping to MSFT)\n   * PDF reader for PDF data (like SEC filings)\n   * Google, Yahoo, Tiingo\\*, Nasdaq News, SEC feeds\n   * Can also ingest arbitrary RSS feeds\n* Options scanner\n   * Filter based on a variety of criteria such as DTE, greeks, and return on capital\n* PnL modeling\n* Social data feeds\n   * Reddit post crawling, along with symbol extraction\n   * Social trend visualizations / analysis\n   * See the most talked about symbols in various subreddits\n   * See trends over time\n* Equity research\n   * Fundamentals\n   * Quarterly report data\n   * Pre-filtered news and social views\n* Treasury data\n   * Yield curves (current and historical)\n   * Yields over time\n* NASDAQ database charting\n   * Full-text search of datasets available\n   * Chart one or more dataset for comparison\n   * Able to support subscription datasets but currently only pulls free ones\n* Earnings calendar\n* Basic watchlist\n\nIf you have stuck it out this far, thanks! I am not quite ready for people to use it, hopefully in the next week or so, and I would love to have some willing beta testers - I will gladly give free licenses to people who help out. The app is, by design, multi-platform so it will run on macOS (x86 and M1), Windows and Linux, so anyone should be able to run it. \n\nPlanned future features that exist in a rough form but are not ready for people to use:\n\n* Forex market data / news / etc.\n* Crypto market bits\n* Backtesting / strategy building\n* Custom charting scripts for creating strategies\n* Additional third-party data sources\n* Custom dashboards and research views\n* More social feeds (Twitter at a minimum)\n* Built-in predictive models using ML (it already has some of this, namely HMM prediction, but I have been experimenting with news / market correlation and other things which would likely make their way in here.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jk6ius5l48481.png?width=3248&format=png&auto=webp&s=20192bfa43f66fc603140003342afa6f78aab516\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kmzju0sm48481.png?width=3258&format=png&auto=webp&s=139cfc02e48669745ff0195a60be9585a21efb9f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4vw61a6n48481.png?width=3246&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa48d827b37f9314c0214c785991849336f71d30\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/veh3uy6o48481.png?width=3244&format=png&auto=webp&s=951859d38bf7898c8f2980a231bfce54593c0c90\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/drcl70wo48481.png?width=3250&format=png&auto=webp&s=52f8ac0922703de2cc511bd73d0486b9bc6cce68\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ucy4vf7q48481.png?width=3252&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e046d1b19850e377de45885cba6bc26e7b04119\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nr0yiqft48481.png?width=3266&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a15470a50983a5472431366c71c3e613ec447d5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kobk19xt48481.png?width=3268&format=png&auto=webp&s=5af0bad90999fa23b7b627b91d3b26cdc99c001d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7eey8gvu48481.png?width=3270&format=png&auto=webp&s=cda6a8b6311cef86a992e8a87155a293664f2ed9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yc5qafd258481.png?width=3256&format=png&auto=webp&s=374949dffbb54924a1b651d06627963f69196855", "id": "rbflir", "created_utc": 1638928608.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "This is amazing work.

I want to have the data available offline and available on my machine in a structured way that is predictable and consistent (and I think other people would like this as well); I find that I do a lot of experimentation in R, Python or Scala worksheets and while it's entirely feasible (and easy) to ingest data in non-typesafe languages, you inevitably end up with a bunch of data that you need to keep looking at to remember exactly which data came from which provider because it's a bunch of dataframe columns with random strings which is just painful so my workflow is basically this: find a data set -> write some Scala / JVM code to ingest the data into the database -> fiddle with it using R / python -> write something in the app that is reproducible for me later. \n\n2. I am probably old and curmudgeonly but I remember a time when you would buy a piece of software and then, you know... you owned it. This is neither here nor there but I loathe the subscription model (and I know lots of others do too, like with Adobe's CC offerings, for example). Plus, as a personal engineering aside, I really don't like dealing with JavaScript and the tire-fire of an ecosystem that it comes with so for my own personal use I find writing a desktop app to be more predictable and easier in many ways than dealing with it. \n\n3. I have spent enough of my life working on services I have to manage and I am kind of tired of it (I spent a long time at Amazon and AWS) so unless there's a compelling reason, I would prefer to avoid running anything critical these days - I still cringe a little bit when I hear a pager :-) \n\nAll that said, part of why I am hoping to get feedback is exactly that -- if it turns out everyone says \"man I would totally pay for that if I could use it on the web\" then that's what I will do, but for now a desktop app suits me best!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Appreciate the reply.\n\nI agree the JS ecosystem is a dumpster fire, especially the new shiny stuff. That said you can still find success in using plain old HTML/CSS/JS looking at Optionistics [1] for example. Totally understand why you'd rather not do any hosting at this point though.\n\nNowadays people are used to renting software as opposed to owning it. Bad for customers, good for businesses (like you). Your app can justify it because I'm sure it'll need to be updated at some point to integrate with more data sources - would you give those out for free? Or pay-to-upgrade? Look at it this way, the finance guys are all about risk/reward so they'd be willing to throw $100/mo on a tool if it means they'll earn $1000 back. Don't sell yourself short is what I'm saying.\n\n[1]\n\nhttps://www.optionistics.com/", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "If you’re serious you should get a UI guy in to help with that stuff. \n\n\nStuff is too horizontal like earnings calendar. \n\n\nOptions screener is good but you need more strings. Checkout TOS for how they do theirs. I don’t have it but from what I’ve seen it’s good because you can setup your own mathematical criteria which is amazing. Like to do a custom math formula of for example delta / premium x open interest. (Nonsense formula). But that way people can do whatever they want. \n\n\nI would pay money to have access to that and for any stock and all strikes all expiry. I do that in excel (google) and it’s painstaking because I can’t scrape data for the Greeks directly. \n\n\n\nI’d really write out who your target customer is. Pros. Semi pros. Amateurs. Etc. what they are looking for and how you will deliver it. This will help you with marketing it later. \n\n\nOther random thoughts: \n\nLayering graphs on graphs. I’d like to be able to do things like see the jobs reports numbers layered over SPY. \n\n\nAlerts. Custom alerts. Price swings of xyz etc. webull alerts could be used as a basis for what types and kinds to offer. \n\n\nNews too horizontal again. Whole page needs a lot of UI work but I think you know that already. Just mentioning it as I look through. \n\n\nComparatives for company financials. So I can lookup company DICK and see it has whatever metrics.  So what. I need to first know who the competitors are which would be good to have, and then be able to compare it to direct competitors and then compare sporting goods stores as a whole to other types of stores like furniture stores, and then compare to retail stores as a whole. That would be valuable data. \n\n\nAll the stock screeners I can find aren’t very good. Either handicapped or limited or whatever. So that would be a good thing to have / add, and detail out. Allowing for custom calculated metrics would also be interesting. Like debt / gross margin or whatever. \n\n\n\nSocial trends. Sure but what sources. You’d have to include sources and saying which ones are picked up and how. If it’s just number of mentions then that’s misleading to me because TSLA will always be quite high and I’ll miss GFD or whatever stock that’s hotly being talked about. \n\n\nI don’t know how, but trying to discern the quality of it is good too. If it’s just short squeeze sub spamming PROG that means nothing to me. \n\nBut instead if it’s Twitter organically not retweeting a ticker and lots of ordnance twits and reddits then that would be more powerful of an indicator to me. \n\n\nAdding it’s % gain up / down would be good as well. Also the options availability. \n\n\nSocial trends. Filter out CC and CSP and stuff like that which are acronyms. Don’t need WTF LOL either right. And again need to discern quality and sentiment not just number of mentions. Some other built services do that so you could explore those and see how to do the same. \n\n\nCheckout market chameleon for more of the in depth options screening stuff. Hot ops. Etc. \n\n\nA big aspect of hot stocks hot ops is volume which lots of services and screeners don’t do a good job of identifying. If a stock has a huge or unusual ops uptick I’d want to know. Some notification services like unusual whales exist for this. \n\n\nYou could include options payout graphs and tables like the ops profit calcs have. Oh sorry you do have that. Needs to be prettier.

While I firmly believe in the old UNIX philosophy of \"small tools you can string together\", the biggest problem for me has been twofold: first you end up spending a bunch of money on services that you have to keep paying, and second it makes it challenging at a minimum, sometimes downright impossible, to do any correlation between them because you don't have access to the raw data. This is also why I have been building a local app with data available, to make this kind of thing possible even if it's not built into the app itself just yet.\n\nI do have some ongoing work to better calculate quality of content - I am currently building some bits that do sentiment analysis and topic modeling of the content so I can decide if, to your point, it's a meaningful discussion or just a bunch of symbol spam, which also will help with identifying symbols / subjects / topics that are just noise vs. those which are meaningful. \n\nThe last point you bring up is a big part of why I'm now looking for feedback - I have thought that it may be better to break it into smaller, more focused applications, and either sell them separately (or license them separately, whichever) based on what folks are looking for.

So how does SPY face resistance? (right now $470 for example)  The only way this could make sense given my definition of SPY above is that majority of the companies (AAPL, MSFT, TSLA, etc) are also facing resistance.

At this level, Zynga offers a combination of value and growth, which makes it a great buy, in my opinion.\"\n\nAt the current price the ratio is even more discounted.
