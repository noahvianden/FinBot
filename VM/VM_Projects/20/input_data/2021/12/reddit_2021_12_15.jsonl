{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, Dec 15, 2021. Please enjoy!", "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 15, 2021**\n\nThe stock market opened the day but reversed course and bounced today as investors digested the Federal Reserve‚Äôs final monetary policy decision of 2021 and Fed Chair Jerome Powell‚Äôs speech against a backdrop of persistent inflationary pressures. Bond yields rose up in the immediate aftermath of the Fed‚Äôs announcement, rising above 1.46%.\n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): +1.56%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +2.28%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): 1.02%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.59%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -6.84%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): +7.81%\n* Apple (AAPL): +2.85%\n* UnitedHealth (UNH): +3.11%\n\nToday, the Fed announced it would double the pace of tapering and signaled a strong likelihood that there would be an interest hike, probably around August-September (according to the Fed‚Äôs dot-plot), the first since rates were slashed to near zero in March 2020. This was largely the expected outcome of this meeting. \n\nSince the depths of the pandemic, the Fed has added trillions of dollars in U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to boost liquidity during a time of crisis and prevent a credit crunch. In November, the Fed started to taper the pace of those aggregate purchases by $15 billion per month, and will now double that pace to $30 billion per month.\n\nA statement by the Fed said, ‚ÄúIn light of inflation developments and the further improvement in the labor market, the Committee decided to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities.‚Äù\n\nThe new pacing would bring all asset purchases to a full stop by March 2022, faster than the course set forth in November that originally sought to end purchases by the middle of next year. The decision had unanimous agreement.\n\nA quicker taper gives the Fed room to move earlier on interest rate hikes. All of the 18 members present at the meeting said they could see the case for at least one rate hike next year, a noticeable revision up from [September projections showing a 50-50 split on a 2022 rate hike](https://news.yahoo.com/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-september-2021-141145429.html).\n\nThe updated dot plots, which map out each of the FOMC members‚Äô projections for where rates will be in coming years, shows the median member of the committee projecting three rate hikes next year, another three in 2023, and another two in 2024. Link for dot-plot below\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20211215.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20211215.pdf)\n\nThe Fed said, ‚ÄúSupply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to elevated levels of inflation.‚Äù\n\nThe median expectation of the committee sees core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed‚Äôs preferred measure of inflation, \n\nclocking in at 2.6% in 2022 (compared to 2.2% in the Fed‚Äôs September projections). Core PCE came in at 4.1% in October (data for November core PCE comes out December 23.\n\n[https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index-excluding-food-and-energy](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index-excluding-food-and-energy)\n\nThe next Fed meeting is scheduled to take place Jan. 25 and 26.\n\nArt Hogan, Chief Market Strategist at the National Securities Corporation said, ‚ÄúWhen you have an anticipation of higher interest rates, growth stocks or long-duration growth stocks certainly get hit the hardest. When you do that net present value calculation with a higher interest rate, that implied multiple or ascribed multiple to growth names comes in. So a lot of that's been priced in. When you think about some of those real ‚Äògrowth-y‚Äô names and momentum names and risk assets, they've seen a lot of carnage already.\"\n\nHe continued, ‚ÄúWhat the market is trying to tell us here is that when you set your asset allocation plan for next year, you want to have a barbell approach with growth on one side ‚Äî you want to have those growth names that are actually valued at a multiple to earnings, not a multiple to revenues or a multiple to cash flows or a multiple to sales. We anticipate 2022 is going to be very much like 2021, where you really want to have a balance between growth and value.\"\n\nI broadly agree with this perspective, 2021 was a hard year for a lot of people who went too heavy into growth after an insane 2020. It‚Äôs always important to have a good mix between growth, value, and I‚Äôll add safe ETFs.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Pfizer (PFE) jumped to a fresh record intraday high on Wednesday amid optimism over the company's COVID-19 pill, called Paxlovid. President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the White House had ordered enough of the antiviral pills to treat 10 million Americans, and that he was \"encouraged by the promising data\" that the drug-maker released on the pill. Pfizer's data showed earlier this week that the drug decreased the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% for high-risk adults. \n* Amazon's web hosting platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced connectivity issues Wednesday morning, triggering outages at platforms from Zoom Video Communications to Amazon-owned Twitch and other online services. \n* Retail sales were up 0.3% in November compared to October, [the Commerce Department said on Wednesday](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf). This came in below the 0.8% monthly increase consensus economists were expecting, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. In October, retail sales rose 1.8%, which was upwardly revised from the 1.7% increase previously expected. \n* The office of the U.S. Trade Representative is concerned with Canada's announcement that it will continue to pursue a unilateral digital services tax, a USTR spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday. ‚ÄúIf Canada adopts a DST, USTR would examine all options, including under our trade agreements and domestic statutes,‚Äù it said.\n* Food safety issues were found at over a dozen Starbucks outlets in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou, regulators said on Tuesday, a day after the U.S. coffee chain was criticized for violations at two other outlets in another city.\n* The Digital Markets Act (DMA), unveiled by EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager last December, sets out a list of dos and don'ts for U.S. tech giants designated as online gatekeepers with fines up to 10% of global turnover for violations, a global first.", "id": "rhb8ge", "created_utc": 1639607306.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Anchorage Capital Group Just defaulted was one of the biggest hedge funds shorting AMC", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "do you post your summaries to r/investing?

{"title": "VZ -- and the search for pricing errors in the market", "selftext": "I'm out of AMD and into VZ.  Here's why -- \n\nAll last spring and summer, I made the pitch that AMD was a coiled value spring, and that pricing the stock in the $70s and $80s was a mistake that would get corrected within the next few months.  That mis-priced market error was so obvious it was painful to not think I was missing something.  But, as we all know now ... I was right.  I was so persistent in my presentation of this information that the moderators one board actually accused me of being a \"shill\".\n\nBut, my goal was the same then as it is now:  to present my argument for why the market consensus has terribly mis-priced a quality company.  I took my profits in AMD, and now, I've moved on.  \n\nThe next mis-priced great company that I am accumulating is Verizon.  Here's why --\n\nThe pandemic pushed more people on line and the use of 5G cell phones is being swept up in that move.  Data usage is increasing more rapidly than carrier pricing is falling.  Cell carriers are making much more money than the cost of building out 5G and meeting demand.\n\nMeanwhile, cars are becoming more connected .. and new EVs are really ramping up that trend.  Soon everybody will be paying a second monthly shot to the 5G providers for their car. \n\nNext comes the huge increase in data-crunching connected trucking.  As trucking companies look to find efficiencies every minute waiting, hauling, loading, and unloading will be tracked through 5G sensors.\n\nFinally, the move to 5G means that wireless companies can compete for the home and office business that is currently owned by the cable companies.\n\nIn summary, the three big telecom cell providers -- VZ, T, TMUS will be making income from your phone, your car, your home and the deliveries of your purchases.\n\nAnd the idea that the little and secondary cell providers give a different option is a fiction -- behind the curtain, they are all paying one of the three main carriers to actually do the work.  This is particularly true of aggressive new offerings from Spectrum and other cable companies.\n\nThis past week, I've made the pitch for accumulating VZ as my preferred choice of the three.  The reasons:\n\n1.  Consistently profitable and actually paying one of the best dividends of all DOW stocks.\n\n2. Quality of network leadership.\n\n3. Cheap debt -- VZ wisely financed the 5G expansion using bonds with fixed rates which are essentially free in the current inflationary environment.\n\nVZ is a beaten down coiled spring like AMD was last spring and summer.

Also the abnormal low float might make it a lot more expensive, very fast.\n\nYou can search for the reason just by google $BBAI.\n\nWait, but **Who is $BBAI**\n\nBig Bear AI (aka $BBAI) provides decision dominance (as they say) to intelligence communities, national defence and global corporations. Simplisticaly put: they analyze huge volumes of data, use a smart machine and can predict enemy moves, supply chain problems, predict the outcome of naval battle even before jumping in. etc.\n\nThe bigger that volume of data and the longer the built of the AI, the better the results.\n\n**Let's see just how valuable is $BBAI and what can move it higher faster.**\n\nI. **They outperform the AI market and that market is growing really fast**\n\n**AI market is booming and everybody knows that.**\n\nBBAI is not only in the right market but also outperforms that market.\n\nThe global Artificial Intelligence (AI) market size is expected to gain momentum by reaching USD 360.36 billion by 2028 while exhibiting a CAGR of **33.6%** between 2021 to 2028.\n\nBigBear.ai‚Äôs is growing even faster: Customers is booming: **U.S. Intelligence Community, Department of Defense, and U.S. Federal Government, space companies, logistics companies, etc.** Some MOU with UAV Factory and Redwaire is building for new lines of business as well.\n\n**Added more than $150 million of new contract awards in the third quarter only bringing total backlog to approximately $485 million as of September 30, 2021.

I;ve selected 2 key pple that you should know about:\n\n**Reginal Brothers - CEO**\n\n**\"Reggie\" Brothers has deep connections and knowledge with in the military and intelligence R&D**. Beside being former CTO at Peraton, Dr. Brothers served as **Under Secretary for Science and Technology at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security** (DHS) (**Obama nominee - yup**) where he was responsible for oversight of **Department of Defense (DoD) laboratories and helped ensure the long-term strategic direction of the Department‚Äôs Science and Technology programs.** Dr. Brothers has also held senior roles as Technical Fellow, Director of Mission Applications and Director of Advanced Programs and Technology at BAE Systems, Program Manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (**DARPA**) etc.\n\n**Sam Gordy - a recent addition and meaningful one:** the new president of federal and chief operating officer of BigBear.ai can quickly rattle off the big numbers behind some of the lines of business he ran at **Leidos ($1.5 billion)** and at **IBM ($2.5 billion.)**. BigBear.ai is not at the same scale at $150 million in annual revenue today, but Gordy says the potential is huge and was one factor in his [decision to join the company on Nov. 1](https://washingtontechnology.com/blogs/editors-notebook/2021/11/bigbear-new-hires.aspx) 2021.\n\nThe list is bigger - but with only this 2 leaders of the company $BBAI have knowledge and access to some of the biggest move in the industry - either from the Federal Gov, military or from the corporate world.\n\nIII. **Third catalyst for BBAI: The right partners and the list os growing**\n\n**Just 3 weeks ago BBAI announced the partnership with the king of inteligence data - Palantir.**\n\nEither you like or not Pether Thiel, you have to admit he is a pretty smart and influent guy arround tech world - especially when is connected with the intelligence community.\n\n\"As part of the integrated product offering, Palantir‚Äôs Foundry platform will be integrated with BigBear.ai‚Äôs Observe, Orient and Dominate products, creating powerful machine learning extensions for the Palantir ecosystem that will provide global data collection, generate actionable insights and deliver anticipatory intelligence at enterprise scale to address high-growth federal and commercial verticals including space, retail, logistics and energy.\"\n\nIn short - a lot , **really** a lot more customers for $BBAI - this exactly the part that I like from their partnership : BBAI capabilities are added as an extra to the Palantir Foundry - meaning 2 things: Palantir recognizing the value and uniqueness of BBAI platform and BBAI getting a lot more customers from Palantir.\n\nBeside that you can see a list of partners on [bigbear.ai](https://bigbear.ai/) website even though, due to the nature of intelligence and military contracts (secrecy) they don't provide much details.\n\nSufice to say that among those partners you can count: Amazon, Microsoft Azure, Knime, Apian, etc.\n\nIV. **How $BBAI stands in regard of valuation? Is it realy cheap at this price?**\n\nSo, [Bigbear.ai](https://bigbear.ai/) is the second pure play stock on Artifial Intelligence. You probably know the first one - $AI ([C3.ai](https://c3.ai/)) jumped some 200% after IPO and stayed in the headlines for months.\n\nLet's compare this two, even if $AI is now a lot lower than it used to be.\n\n**OK, let's see the valuation:**\n\n$AI Market cap - 3.5B\n\nFY2021 (they close reporting year in June) - they had 182M revenue\n\nFor 2022 - (June 2021 -june 2022) they expect 243M.\n\n$BBAI Market Cap - 1.1B\n\n**Full-year 2021 projected revenue between $160 million and $185 million**\n\nFor BBAI the reporting yesr ends in December.\n\nYou see revenues are pretty much in line with some 10% higher for $AI as they closed financial year 2021 in june. For 2022 $BBAI for example expects **260M.**\n\nSo, **$AI has now a 3.5B market cap. After IPO has spiked to almost 10B so this valuation now is a conservative number.**\n\n**$BBAI has now 1.1 B market cap - 3 times cheaper whle playing in the same field, getting a lot more military contracts and growing faster.**\n\n**Hey but $AI is making headlines while $BBAI is not**\n\n**V. News/raly potential - some pretty cool stuf**\n\nHere is what BBAI is doing and judge by yourself what are the ods we will see BgBearAI in th news headlines pretty soon:\n\nIn short , [BigBear.ai](https://bigbear.ai/) is using artificial intelligence to process some 160B data sources to generate real time predictions. They have 500M in back log contracts and made this year alone some 160M from contracts with the DoD (military), the navy, intelligence community.\n\n**Want some examples: They have predicted Russia invasion of Crimea, routes for oil smugling in Mediteranian Sea and they are helping right now with strategies to engage Iran.**\n\n**Very recent they have predicted China's moves in Twain airspace. (search \"china\" in this article to learn more)**\n\n[https://washingtontechnology.com/blogs/editors-notebook/2021/12/bigbear-path-forward.aspx](https://washingtontechnology.com/blogs/editors-notebook/2021/12/bigbear-path-forward.aspx)\n\n**Imagine how valuable is this for the National Security and mostly for the Defence Budget ;)**\n\n**For the intelligence comunity they predict change in behaviout at hime and abroad. They have save 100years of human work (qualified and expensive intelligence work). Imagine how much value they created there.**\n\n**For maritime comapanies they have predicted weather paterns, discovered new routes and new customers. Maritime shipping has been at the core of supply chain disruptions and there are billions there ready to grab if you can offer efficiency and results.**\n\nSo, with less attention and glamour today, $BBAI is a good candidate with high growth, strong moat and riding one of the most influential tech revolution of the century.\n\nAnd yes, you might want to check the float and the redemptions as that might make BBAI a lot more expensive very fast before you have a chance to buy it. You can read more on that if you just google itor on twitter where this play is starting to trend.\n\nBut that is what I think. What do you think ?

Bond yields rose up in the immediate aftermath of the Fed‚Äôs announcement, rising above 1.46%.\n\n**Notable Numbers Today**\n\n* S&P 500 (SPY): +1.56%\n* Nasdaq (QQQ): +2.28%\n* Dow Jones (DIA): 1.02%\n* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.59%\n* Volatility Index (VIX): -6.84%\n* NVIDIA (NVDA): +7.81%\n* Apple (AAPL): +2.85%\n* UnitedHealth (UNH): +3.11%\n\nToday, the Fed announced it would double the pace of tapering and signaled a strong likelihood that there would be an interest hike, probably around August-September (according to the Fed‚Äôs dot-plot), the first since rates were slashed to near zero in March 2020. This was largely the expected outcome of this meeting. \n\nSince the depths of the pandemic, the Fed has added trillions of dollars in U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to boost liquidity during a time of crisis and prevent a credit crunch. In November, the Fed started to taper the pace of those aggregate purchases by $15 billion per month, and will now double that pace to $30 billion per month.\n\nA statement by the Fed said, ‚ÄúIn light of inflation developments and the further improvement in the labor market, the Committee decided to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities.‚Äù\n\nThe new pacing would bring all asset purchases to a full stop by March 2022, faster than the course set forth in November that originally sought to end purchases by the middle of next year. The decision had unanimous agreement.\n\nA quicker taper gives the Fed room to move earlier on interest rate hikes. All of the 18 members present at the meeting said they could see the case for at least one rate hike next year, a noticeable revision up from [September projections showing a 50-50 split on a 2022 rate hike](https://news.yahoo.com/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-september-2021-141145429.html).\n\nThe updated dot plots, which map out each of the FOMC members‚Äô projections for where rates will be in coming years, shows the median member of the committee projecting three rate hikes next year, another three in 2023, and another two in 2024. Link for dot-plot below\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20211215.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20211215.pdf)\n\nThe Fed said, ‚ÄúSupply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to elevated levels of inflation.‚Äù\n\nThe median expectation of the committee sees core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed‚Äôs preferred measure of inflation, \n\nclocking in at 2.6% in 2022 (compared to 2.2% in the Fed‚Äôs September projections). Core PCE came in at 4.1% in October (data for November core PCE comes out December 23.\n\n[https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index-excluding-food-and-energy](https://www.bea.gov/data/personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index-excluding-food-and-energy)\n\nThe next Fed meeting is scheduled to take place Jan. 25 and 26.\n\nArt Hogan, Chief Market Strategist at the National Securities Corporation said, ‚ÄúWhen you have an anticipation of higher interest rates, growth stocks or long-duration growth stocks certainly get hit the hardest. When you do that net present value calculation with a higher interest rate, that implied multiple or ascribed multiple to growth names comes in. So a lot of that's been priced in. When you think about some of those real ‚Äògrowth-y‚Äô names and momentum names and risk assets, they've seen a lot of carnage already.\"\n\nHe continued, ‚ÄúWhat the market is trying to tell us here is that when you set your asset allocation plan for next year, you want to have a barbell approach with growth on one side ‚Äî you want to have those growth names that are actually valued at a multiple to earnings, not a multiple to revenues or a multiple to cash flows or a multiple to sales. We anticipate 2022 is going to be very much like 2021, where you really want to have a balance between growth and value.\"\n\nI broadly agree with this perspective, 2021 was a hard year for a lot of people who went too heavy into growth after an insane 2020. It‚Äôs always important to have a good mix between growth, value, and I‚Äôll add safe ETFs.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares of Pfizer (PFE) jumped to a fresh record intraday high on Wednesday amid optimism over the company's COVID-19 pill, called Paxlovid. President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the White House had ordered enough of the antiviral pills to treat 10 million Americans, and that he was \"encouraged by the promising data\" that the drug-maker released on the pill. Pfizer's data showed earlier this week that the drug decreased the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% for high-risk adults. \n* Amazon's web hosting platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced connectivity issues Wednesday morning, triggering outages at platforms from Zoom Video Communications to Amazon-owned Twitch and other online services. \n* Retail sales were up 0.3% in November compared to October, [the Commerce Department said on Wednesday](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf).

Or did the market just fuck me up?", "selftext": "In the past couple of months I've been writing some CSPs on various underlyings, which in principle I would be okay with to own. Until mid-november everything was working out as intended and I made some reasonable profits. However, two positions have gone against me and erased all the profits I made wheeling (let's call this learning money).   \n\n\nI am curious if you guys can help me analyse my situation and maybe indicate what I should have done differently to limit the (unrealized) losses.  Here is the scenario:\n\n**PLTR Put 23 17 DEC, 0.87 credit, sold on 9 Nov (\\~0.30 delta at that point in time). Rolled the position on 14 Dec to 23P 14 Jan for 0,10 credit. PLTR is currently trading at $18**  \nI sold this CSP  just after the PLTR results expecting that the dump would be of short duration and I could BTC reasonably soon. Unfortunately the opposite happened and it tanked further. I already considered rolling \\~2 weeks ago when PLTR was still trading at $20, but was like: it'll go up again... Should I have rolled earlier to ensure that I could capture more extrinsic value for the roll? What would have been a good indicator to roll?\n\n**TKWY Put 56, 17 DEC, 1.04 credit, sold on 26 Nov( \\~0.30 delta at that point in time).  Rolled the position 15 Dec to 56P 17 Jan for 0.55 credit. TKWY is currently trading at EUR 46**  \nI am quite bullish on this stock and think it is heavily undervalued (I also have some shares with cost basis of EUR 90). However last few weeks with (potentially) rising inflation rates and interest have hurt the company. I rolled the position because I am trading in a margin account and this is less capital intensive than owning the stocks outright. In the long run I would expect to be able to keep rolling until it gets above the 56 again, but I am also fair to realise that this may take quite a while. I also was kind of surprised of the credit I was still collecting for a put this far out of the money.

There are tactical opportunities when IV blows out and the market is paying stupid high premium for far out of the money puts.  Those are safe to sell.  Riskier, but also feasible, is selling the far out of the money call when both price and IV blow up.

There's a big difference between a 0.3 delta put that is trading at 4% of the strike versus one trading at 1%.  The high premium is a warning sign that the bottom can drop out of the stock at any time.\n\nI don't know about $TKWY.AMS because it trades on the Dutch stock exchange, but I suspect it's also a meme stock which is why it's fallen so fast in a short period of time.\n\nIf it were me, I'd just buy to close at a loss and start over with a position with better odds of profit.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "PLTR is a meme stock in the same way TSLA or AAPL are.
