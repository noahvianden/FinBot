{"title": "Why is Everyone Sleeping on TSP? How China will soon control 80% of global land freight.", "selftext": "* Imagine you own a trucking company with one driver that makes $300-400k a year and you pay the driver between 100k-150k which is roughly the current industry average margin. Now imagine you fire the driver, you put his salary in your pocket. You triple his productivity because your new driver doesn’t have to sleep, and lower the cost of gas emissions and insurance because your new driver has machine precision driving speed and never gets tired at 3am in Nebraska, driver error being a leading cause of accidents in the industry. This is the potential bottom line gain impending implementation of AI trucking. And TSP is the undisputed leader in this field.\n* There will only be one real winner in this space. Much like other modern monopolies the competitive advantage of coming to market first will be key as well as the State-Owned Enterprise (SOE) model of Chinese investment, which I will assume most investors are aware that Chinese SOE's are de facto extensions of the Chinese state and will further advance Chinese geopolitical and economic interests for One Belt One Road and solidify their hold on the world island now that the U.S. has exited the continent via the humiliation of the Afghanistan withdrawal. Early investors may reap great rewards by 2024 when the trucks are scheduled to be up and running but the space is highly innovative and the company is already crushing their own schedule. [https://www.benzinga.com/startups/21/06/21585559/tusimple-autonomous-freight-network-6-months-ahead-of-schedule](https://www.benzinga.com/startups/21/06/21585559/tusimple-autonomous-freight-network-6-months-ahead-of-schedule)\n* Due in part to China’s ownership stake in TSP, China will now in short order control 80% of global land freight and its recent rhetoric, during its 100 year anniversary where Communist Emperor Xi recently brought up in a bone chilling Communist Party speech the memory of the humiliation of China after the Opium Wars and how to put it in English, “*The Shoe’s on the other foot.”*\n* Idea: Why are people sleeping on TSP and AI trucking stocks? The most practical investing in useless meme stocks and completely worthless cryptos (according to the Don, Warren Buffet you don't go against the Don), and actually buy something hyper valuable, like new AI trucking stock TuSimple (TSP). In my opinion B-coin is the ultimate Vanity of vanities, no intrinsic value, a big fat 0  over the negative which is the enormous energy cost to keep it operating.  \n* Great starting point to buy in even by hater standards, company market cap only $10 billion with unprecedented growth potential when the technology is inevitably adopted soon en masse to deal with global supply disruptions and increase efficiency in the global supply chain without actually ever reducing costs as TSP will effectively operate as a horizontal monopoly. It is currently the only company in the field with a business model that captures land freight transport from shipping ports, trucks, railways etc.\n* Massive rise in cost of freight over 500% rise since pandemic last year Asia to US/Europe, again TSP’s business model is designed for the global market and the US and China specifically.\n* A rare buy with tremendous fundamental growth potential and proven explosive technical potential.. The ones who look into it and buy sooner are the clever ones and will benefit even more exponentially \n* Cathie Wood’s Ark Invest has bought over 5 million shares of TSP.\n* **“Autonomous Ride Hailing:** AVs will be able to move people as well as parcels from point A to point B at 1/10th the cost of a taxi today, according to ARK Invest. The research company goes as far as saying the 10-year net present value (NPV) of cashflows from the niche industry are more than $1 trillion today … and could be up to $9 trillion by 2029.” Matt McCall, MoneyWire\n* Proven even with just currently available public information that TSP’s public road testing in the Southwest is going great and made a 24 hour road trip in 14 hours with its AI driving technology in which the driver made absolutely NO input.
