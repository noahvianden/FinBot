{"title": "Red Rock Resorts (RRR) has tremendous potential to explode üöÄüöÄ", "selftext": "Casino companies and hotels are among the sectors that have been hardest hit by the Corona crisis and the following restrictions. I took a very close look at the entire sector and found my favorite for the upcoming recovery in this segment - Here comes the high flyer, which is developing extremely well despite all the adversities: Red Rock Resorts (RRR)!\n\nRed Rock Resorts, Inc. was founded in 1976 and can therefore look back on many years of experience. In addition to managing the Station Casinos (\"Station LLC\"), the company also has a fair equity interest in them.\n\nStation Casinos offers a variety of gambling and other entertainment to the residents of Las Vegas. Station LLC owns and operates 10 large gaming and entertainment facilities and 10 smaller casinos.\n\nWith the reopening of its casinos after the lockdowns, the company is reporting good results, revenue and most importantly, profits. Red Rock has learned a lot during the pandemic and is evolving its operations accordingly, resulting in much higher profit margins. Unprofitable facilities were cut, marketing budgets cut, headcount reduced and unprofitable casinos closed. In the past quarter, on a like-for-like basis (compared to 2019 results), sales increased 5% and profits increased 38%. Red Rock also announced that it has sold the troubled Palms casino for a high price and will soon begin building a new casino in Durango. So fundamentally things are looking very good for Red Rock Resorts.\n\nSince the company also has no exposure in Asia, the shares are already doing significantly better than those of the competition such as MGM, WYNN or PENN, some of which have quite a large exposure in Macau. There, the corona crisis is still a heavy block on the leg due to the stricter rules in China.\n\nI think Red Rock Resorts (RRR) stock has tremendous potential and could go up significantly in the near future.\n\n**UPDATE (to understand better why I\\`m choosing RRR):**\n\nLet's take a look at a few charts. First, I created my own index with all the major players in the casino industry. Included in this index are BALY, BYD, CZR, PENN, MGM, WYNN, GDEN, HGV, LVS and of course Red Rock Resorts (RRR). In the course of this self-created index, we can see that it has increased extremely since the Corona low.\n\n[Casino-Index](https://preview.redd.it/ggjgjc8q3nn71.jpg?width=1878&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1e8cf1dd4d76d26938774464215b6c9b61d7dde5)\n\n[ At last we were in a sideways movement. But now there was the breakout of the last double high. I strongly expect this movement to continue upwards. ](https://preview.redd.it/baon2vh14nn71.jpg?width=1877&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=af0b38dcb49fb508caec6abeaf948ded0abb5fd2)\n\nWhy Red Rock Resorts? To do this, I look at the development of all casino candidates from my index. There are stocks that have done just fine and others that have done very badly (especially those positioned in Macau. The Chinese still have very strong restrictions due to Corona). There is one very clear outperformer and that is Red Rock Resorts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vzdg83f74nn71.jpg?width=1879&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1388f301529530012d371581795e7f54031a4bd4\n\nI am currently seeing the bullish breakout of the bull flag, which I consider to be a clear buy signal. The market behavior is very clear. We had a sequence of falling lows, then a sequence of rising lows, and we are currently seeing an upward breakout. Here we see a company with absolute relative strength while the entire industry is still struggling with the Corona crisis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s1epssik4nn71.jpg?width=1641&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=71d488a9936552a0820005ce6fb3214eb4c818b4\n\nI expect Red Rock Resorts will continue to benefit from the overall industry rebound. Everything is open at the top. In the near future, we should see $ 60 and more.

{"title": "BABA ON THE MOON PLEASE", "selftext": "15/09/2021 15:42 - MTFL\n\n3 Top Chinese Stocks to Watch in September\n\nIt's scary to invest in stocks from China these days, considering what's going on in the country. Government crackdowns, cancellations of IPOs, and increased regulations are all reasons for alarm. Recently, government authorities took aim at ride-hailing apps for using unqualified drivers and misleading advertising.¬†¬†\nThere's also concern that accounting practices at Chinese companies lack the level of scrutiny found in other countries, creating an increased potential for fraud -- the downfall of¬†Luckin Coffee¬†being a notable example. Such situations amplify worries that Chinese companies could be delisted from U.S. exchanges.\nHowever, the hesitation that these concerns have raised among investors also provides an opportunity to buy stocks with ridiculous growth potential and already rock-steady fundamentals. If you're willing to look past the sector's overall risks,¬†Alibaba¬†,¬†BeiGene¬†, and¬†Tencent Music¬†are three Chinese stocks worth watching this month.\nAlibaba has gone on sale\nAlibaba is often called the Chinese version of¬†Amazon. As the ninth largest company in the world by market cap, Alibaba is also a convenient target for Chinese regulators, and its AutoNavi ride-hailing application was among those the transport ministry recently criticized. In April, regulators fined the company $2.75 billion, citing violations of antimonopoly rules. However, considering how far the stock has fallen this year -- more than 27% -- it's worth noting how fundamentally sound the company's financials are.\nAlibaba's revenue has increased every year for more than a decade, including a 41% rise in fiscal 2021 to $109.4 billion. Net income has also risen consistently every year, with only one exception in 2017. The company made it through the toughest part of the pandemic last year without missing a beat, recording $21.8 billion in sales, up 2% year over year.\nEven with the recent crackdowns, the company's business seems largely unaffected. In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, ending June 30, the company reported revenue of $31.8 billion, up 34% over the same period in the prior year. Net income fell just 8% year over year to $6.6 billion.\nThere are a lot of things to continue to like about this company. For one, it just approved a buyback program for $15 billion worth of shares through 2022. Management also recently pledged the equivalent of $15.5 billion to invest in technology innovation, economic development, high-quality employment creation, care for vulnerable groups, and the establishment of a \"common prosperity development fund.\" Investors weren't thrilled with this idea -- on Sept. 2, the day it was announced, the stock dropped by nearly $6 -- but it could help Alibaba's reputation with Chinese regulators. ¬†\nCompanies with growth such as Alibaba's often trade for high multiples, but after the past few months, it has a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.1, more in line with an old-line value company.", "id": "povr3v", "created_utc": 1631729926.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|59|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|354|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bro, please break it down into smaller paragraphs.", "score": 28, "replies": []}, {"body": "I'm not even reading that.

{"title": "The Big Long", "selftext": "If Sprott Asset Management continues manipulating the Uranium spot market upwards then previous supply constraint back in 07 and 08 ***will look like child's play***. If one tenth of GME hype hits the uranium stocks and some bleeds over to the spot market, it will result in a complete *meltdown* for U stock shorters aka the general commodity shorters. In my opinion, with supply constraints and increased demand (partly aided by shorts), there could be great returns.\n\nPast performance is never completely indicative of future returns, however, the previous uranium bull market demonstrates *solely the low supply‚Äôs effect* on prices. One can extrapolate the potential for higher returns when short interest is added and investor interest is scaled up.\n\nI will show you some charts of uranium stocks in the past 10 years & compare them to today's breakout run. I will also highlight key differences between then and now, as well as why I believe there is real potential for another run.\n\n[U stock all-time chart](https://preview.redd.it/9auo2ujouqn71.png?width=3717&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea4dc90a15d256e9ad3d27868af13b3eb6d927c3)\n\n[$URA all-time chart](https://preview.redd.it/49dmvnlquqn71.png?width=3840&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4a767e53b8b94778a69ac2142c4a384d9616279)\n\n[U spot price 2017-now](https://preview.redd.it/akvui6fh1rn71.png?width=3839&format=png&auto=webp&s=578b445f0072b2505fb259ddeef89ff55bf2a8cf)\n\n$URA (uranium ETF) and others (which I cannot mention) have broken out to 7 year highs. The spot price of uranium mimics both of these stock charts. A week ago the spot price of U was less than $28/lb. Today, as of right now, the price shot up to $45/lb. This is a huge factor for the bull case.\n\n*In 2007 the spot price of uranium peaked at $135/lb*.\n\nThat was 10+ years ago, and with a quickly increasing spot price, the markets were flooded with sells/asks shortly thereafter. The sells were from the heap of new mines which popped up due to increased prices. When supply flooded, miners tapered off.\n\nNow that there are less miners and a huge potential for more demand, I believe uranium is ripe for parabolic movement. This is not financial advice, I could be wrong.\n\nPositions: $URA shares, $20 leaps bought in early feb but still holding and $CCJ\n\nThe cards are stacked in favor of ***critical*** gains my fellow super mutant apes ü¶ç‚öõÔ∏èüöÄ‚ò¢Ô∏è", "id": "pozf9x", "created_utc": 1631741324.0, "score": 130, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|49|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pozf9x/the_big_long/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I imagine if/when the SPUT gets its NYSE listing, the spot price will have room to truly explode.
