{"title": "Using my margin power wisely (also: how do I?)", "selftext": "So I've had a brokerage account for about fifteen years, most of which where I just ignored it and let my college-aged-self boast about the time he bet big on Apple. It is, by any measure of my current financial situation, a fairly sizable account, but I've always just considered it retirement (or emergency) money that I didn't actually have. So, hands off. \"It's not my money,\" I reasoned. \n\nDuring the original phases of quarantine last year, I started playing around with that money, mostly diversifying my 400x gains into some more stable things, but also pulling a few bags in \"fun money\" that I've been playing with. I fooled around with meme stocks, with penny gambles, with trying to ride day trades, and it was all well and good (I didn't go broke), but it hasn't really been fulfilling beyond seeing some moderate portfolio growth that I've still been keeping in the \"not my money yet\" file of my mind (that is, any gains just get reinvested and remain part of the original pool of money college-me set aside).\n\nHowever, as quarantine dragged on, it became clear how much my professional and career situation had stagnated and reached a bit of a crossroads.

I don't have much, but I'm currently comfortable with what I have, and, thankfully, not in dire need. .\n\nI recently received about 100,000 in margin buying power from my broker, which is way more than I expected, and seems like a scary powerful amount for them to lend me. I have no intention to leverage much of it, as that's an amount of money that would take me, in my current life, forever to recoup (aka: I don't want to fuck it up/great power, greater responsibility to not let my Uncle die again). \n\nBut, the way I've figured my current budget, I would like a few hundred extra dollars in income a week. If I can make it using my existing account while continuing to pursue a new direction in life, then that's gravy.\n\nAll of which is an incredibly convoluted way to come around and ask about my current scheme of selling puts:\n\nIs it stupid to use my margin to sell deeply OTM puts (with, say, 25-50 or more % discount from current) to simply rake in a variety of smaller (hopefully safer) premiums? \n\ntl, dr - I have more margin than I expected to have.

{"title": "GameStops Actual Turnaround Strategy Case Study (Amazon/MBA)", "selftext": "**TLDR**\n\nHow does GameStop justify it's valuation of over $10B in market cap, while threats to it's core business accelerate? Console manufacturers are moving to digital delivery instead of physical games (38% of GME revenue). Meanwhile physical consoles, which make up over 49% of GME revenue, is only sold on 4 year cycles--and sold at all competing retailers.\n\nCreate a GME coin that consoles can mine, while powered on and connected to the internet. Users then spend GME Coins online to buy games, in-game items, and cosmetics--competing with Free to Play (F2P) market while supporting game publishers. GME sells the mining processing power to host games and CDNs, turning GME into a technology company.\n\n**Context**\n\nYou are tasked with drafting the turnaround strategy for GameStop, an online and brick-and-mortar retail store specializing in console games and accessories. The chairman for the board, Ryan Cohen, began his turnaround of the business in 2020, aiming to make GameStop the ‚ÄúAmazon of Gaming‚Äù. Recent ‚ÄúMeme Stock‚Äù speculation of the company's stock has driven the price of shares from $15 to as high as $483 in less than a year. As of September 20, 2021 the stock now trades at $189 per share.\n\n**Assumptions**\n\nGameStop has full alignment with Microsoft (Xbox) and Sony (Playstation) to build the ‚Äúnext generation‚Äù of gaming. In the wake of the Epic vs. Apple lawsuit, Microsoft and Sony have determined that retailers such as GameStop are necessary and, for fear of antitrust regulations, have committed to a strong collaboration with GameStop. You have counterparts at both companies working to launch this new product offering. Ryan Cohen is interested in a serious turnaround strategy, to help justify the recent $10 Billion Dollar valuation by share price.\n\n**Challenges to the GameStop business model**\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, online retailers, digital game platforms, and online services grew the most due to the ‚Äústay at home‚Äù nature of pandemic restrictions. These companies saw increased revenue, online users, and engagement ([source](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stay-at-home-stocks-have-been-crushed-here-are-ones-that-could-still-win-long-term-51621036411)). GameStop‚Äôs second quarter earnings of $1.18 Billion dollars of sales, yet reported an operating loss of $.76 per share. GameStop revenue came from 49.7% Hardware and Accessories (Consoles, controllers, adapters, etc), 38.9% Software (used and new video games), and 11.4% Collectibles (figurines, magazines, etc).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gvp45w5h5eq71.png?width=994&format=png&auto=webp&s=80a189cc248d650230faa1e85252dd4d1892ac01\n\nThe major consoles that contributed to GameStops revenue were the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series One. In the recent Epic vs. Apple lawsuit, when asked how much margin Microsoft makes on the Xbox consoles, the head of Xbox business development stated, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt; we sell the consoles at a loss‚Äù. This is because the console market is a ‚Äúhardware subsidy model, where game companies sell the consoles at a loss to attract new customers. Profits are then generated from game sales and online service subscriptions ([source](https://www.news18.com/news/tech/microsoft-sells-xbox-consoles-for-a-loss-but-the-xbox-gaming-business-makes-money-3715331.html)).\n\nEach major game console manufacturer creates new consoles every four years on average, which creates growth challenges to GameStop in interim years between releases. An additional challenge to GameStop‚Äôs future revenue is that each manufacturer operates online digital stores for instant purchasing of games, which is quicker to play than even Amazon can ship. It is estimated that around 50% of console and PC game sales are now being made through an online purchase. Adding insult to injury, both Microsoft and Playstation offer consoles without digital disc drives, requiring digital purchases to operate.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8oinqe1n5eq71.png?width=930&format=png&auto=webp&s=87642bdceb199637d685574151f7187bf5ea600a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6jnphvuu5eq71.png?width=1008&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ad77c6d92c331c85b1655ae05228eb2b48a1830\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/43jwbbdw5eq71.png?width=880&format=png&auto=webp&s=15ddee48f6f1a306a14190f9295d409eb7071736\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mc7nzn646eq71.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=5211fe1ededf644821da80b6b1e473908cfbb742\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gcbxjbi66eq71.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad8e767f4b5cc2e6659acbcf0f50fc610da1f6e1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xjld30ob6eq71.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=e31d223ab51937b2727af8eec83fbc268e5c6654\n\n**Analysis**\n\nGameStops customers are increasingly purchasing digital copies of games directly from Microsoft, Playstation, or Nintendo, instead of physical copies from brick and mortar stores. It‚Äôs estimated that 50% of sales are now digital, and growing.\n\n1. GameStop could work with publishers directly to offer subscription models for new games, exclusive content, or digital expansions, fronting the development costs by capitalizing their market share.\n2. GameStop could try to become the ‚ÄúAmazon of Gaming‚Äù by increasing their fulfillment and logistics chains to deliver physical copies of games and hardware quicker to customers, competing for market share of fixed price products.\n3. GameStop could broaden their hardware offerings to include Gaming PC‚Äôs, laptops, and other hardware accessories, transitioning into more of a Best Buy ($29 Billion Valuation).\n4. GameStop could utilize their 4,000+ Brick and Mortar stores to perform services such as computer repair, and specialty services.\n5. Leverage GameStop‚Äôs brand halo to create experiential events focused around their favorite games with exclusive ‚Äúdrops‚Äù and releases.\n\nSWOT Matrix (Figure 1) and Porters 5 Forces (Figure 2), show that there are increasing threats to the GameStop retailer business model, not only from traditional competitors (Best Buy, Walmart), but also from online retailers such as Amazon and direct-to-consumer marketplaces (Xbox, Playstation, Nintendo Stores). The PEST analysis (Figure 4) shows that marketplaces have a unique sensitivity in today's legal atmosphere that can be utilized to negotiate with Console Manufacturers. Marketing Mix (Figure 5) shows that GameStop does not have a unique marketing position or product offering to leverage. Amazon fuels it‚Äôs growth from nascent businesses by utilizing it‚Äôs profits from Cloud (AWS) while operating at scale to decrease costs while increasing selection. Amazon even created its own last mile delivery and transport hubs to reduce costs and compete with FedEx and UPS. It‚Äôs not feasible for GameStop to do so.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ao50evpe6eq71.png?width=442&format=png&auto=webp&s=578b562722fbbb7379be64c25ae2c2685bc8c457\n\nIn analyzing the current market, positioning of GameStop, and threats to the business, GameStop‚Äôs future is not certain. GameStop risks following in [RadioShack](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081315/5-reasons-why-radioshack-went-out-business.asp) or Circuit City‚Äôs footsteps.\n\n**Recommendation**\n\nGameStop should continue to leverage its sales of Console hardware, accessories, physical games, and used games/trade-ins for the near term. Instead of redeveloping their supply, logistics, and fulfillment chains to maximize delivery speed, GameStop should leverage it‚Äôs existing relationships with manufacturers and game publishers to receive inventory of releases early, and ship with promised delivery with UPS/Fedex. This allows low cost shipping options to be utilized without expensive logistic routes. Fervent fans can still receive their games or consoles on Day 1, but without the upfront [CAPEX costs](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/24/walmart-launches-delivery-business-to-connect-other-local-retailers-with-consumers.html) to GameStop.\n\nUltimately, Judo Strategy (Figure 6) suggests GameStop must find ways to use their opponents' weight and strength against them, rather than emulating what their competitors are already doing well. Drastic steps need to be taken to compete against existing and future incumbents. To increase high-value engagements with GameStop that correlate to retention (eg ‚ÄúStickiness‚Äù), GameStop should create a digital wallet that allows customers to collect ‚Äúcoins‚Äù that they can spend to purchase new games, cosmetics, or in-game purchases.\n\nUtilizing GameStops close relationship with Microsoft and Sony, GameStop should create a console app that performs hosting functions (mining) while connected to the internet. Porters 5 forces (Figure 2) shows that these consoles have expensive GPUs that can perform significant processing functions for centralized servers. [Many server farms today](https://www.businessinsider.com/take-a-look-inside-an-underground-crypto-farm-busted-by-ukraine-police-2021-7) mine cryptocurrencies with consoles due to these strong GPUs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h6vrukth6eq71.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf918fc5d54a68f15a009e9df526842e63b9032e\n\nGameStop customers can then load this application and earn coins for every hour of hosting functions they perform for the collective platform. The hosting services could enable decentralized hosting of online video games and GameStops own e-commerce website. If a customer leaves the app on, performing hosting functions for the decentralized server for one hour, they would earn 1 credit. A new video game release may cost 1,000 credits, in-game cosmetics 500 credits. Credits could also be purchased directly from GameStop instead of mining. This would enable game publishers to create additional mirrors of their games online to prevent ever [increasing DDOS hacks](https://www.pcgamer.com/apex-legends-hacked-to-protest-titanfalls-server-situation/) which cost publishers millions while frustrating customers. This JUDO strategy allows GameStop to shift and compete in a whole new way, while the industry cuts out middlemen with Free-To-Play, digital downloads, and in-app purchases.\n\n**Measuring Success**\n\nEach customer's wallet would be tied to their GameStop account. This customer data would be aggregated to identify unique users. Aged GameStop accounts could be renewed and tied to new wallets. Mining/hosting, spending coins, purchasing coins, and browsing the coin marketplace would be high value engagements (HVEs). As the gaming industry shifts completely to digital games, which could occur as soon as four years from now, GameStop can leverage this hosting strategy to grow revenue directly for game publishers, while competing with ‚ÄúFree to Play‚Äù games. This enables game publishers to continue to create high budget games, without charging exorbitant prices to customers ([which data shows customers are resistant to pay](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/18/free-to-play-games-rule-the-entertainment-world-with-88-billion-in-revenue/)).\n\n**Implementation**\n\nYou would work with the new Sr. Platform Manager of Xbox and Playstation (see assumptions section above), to select three pilot game publishers for this launch. They may include Epic Games (Apex Legends) and Activision (Call of Duty), among others.\n\nThe initial MVP would comprise the following headcount:\n\n1. Two Engineers (Xbox and Playstation App Development)\n2. Four Engineers (Mining/Hosting experts with Content Delivery Network Experience)\n3. One Engineer (Ledger system to calculate payouts, spending, etc)\n4. Three Engineers (Flex, QA)\n5. Four Game Advocates (Work directly with the pilot Game publishers)\n6. One Marketing Specialists (Work directly with PR for news release on launch day)\n7. One Engineer (Coin Spending Storefront)\n\nAfter MVP development, the idea could be iterated on to improve hosting utilization and even sell spare hosting to the general web hosting marketplace. This would include cloud content delivery networks similar to Cloud Flare ($38 Billion Valuation).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Would you leave your console on to mine game coins?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Important Note: I have no holdings in GME or interest in the company.

The money printer is printing trillions of dollars in funny money every year. And the national debt is going parabolic, approaching $30 trillion\n\nThe biggest lie currently effecting the markets is that inflation can be reigned in easily. In the 80's, when inflation was significantly less of a concern than it is today, Fed Chairman Paul Volckear raised interest rates 20% in order to reign in inflation. Today, an interest rate raise of 1% causes a recession. \n\nThe fed cannot tame inflation. And they only pretend to do so because they fear that if people worry about inflation, it will make the problem worse. So they posture about how inflation is transitory, they'll handle it eventually, etc. We are now at the end of 2021 and we still haven't gotten a single taper. Let alone a rate hike. \n\nMost retail realizes this, so we see a mass exodus for the doors. But they also don't know where to put their money in times of inflation, so we run into the issue of retail going cash gang, realizing cash is worthless, fomo'ing back into growth tech, realizing growth tech is topped, and going back into cash gang. Repeating the process\n\nHow to break the cycle\n\nIn times of inflation, you want to store your cash in anything that has a limited supply. Food, commodities like steel or microchips, shipping containers. Anything that the free money being given to everyone will be bidding on. Unfortunately, in 2021, even with all of this speculative future tech, we still haven't figured out a way to eat US dollars to survive\n\nAlmost every one of these sectors is currently nearing their lows. So risk is small, and upside is significant if inflation does not play out the way the fed claims it will, where we enter massive deflation and everything goes back to normal for no reason.\n\nI firmly believe that these sectors are undervalued because the vast majority of retail has no idea what they're doing, and they only know how to invest in tech, but they also know inflation is a problem. If retail had a better understanding of inflation hedges, we would see much more rational movement across the markets", "id": "pxz04e", "created_utc": 1632932807.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Oil the best inflation hedge.
