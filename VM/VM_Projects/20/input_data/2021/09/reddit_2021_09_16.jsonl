But that is beside the point because I can't resist I have to reveal Wall Street's best kept secret. I Stumbled upon Blackstone way back in 2018 when it was trading at around $45 a share I had a very simple reasoning for wanting this stock, I needed something with a fat divi Yield and that could be realied on to make consistent growth so I wouldn't have to worry about dollar cost averaging to capture the juicey yield. This criteria was met with the introduction of Stevei into the equation I believe what happened to turn me on to this stock was that I learned that steve here had received $800 million worth of stock and stock options as a form of compensation that year which seemed like an apsurd amount for someone who was already a partner and co-founder of the world's largest PE firm. Usually CEOs take stock as comp when they genuinely believe that the company is undervalued or will grow in the future. Now I had no doubt that Stevie would want to grow his baby but $800 million worth is a ton of conviction so right there I decided to pickup some $BX in my longterm portfolio. Fast forward 3.5 years and you arrive here today and holy shit I understasnd the conviction now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 day 3 year doesn't it make you wet](https://preview.redd.it/1akpfnudbsn71.png?width=1982&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7b0035de2242e0fd2d69950b6088df4b609aca4)\n\n$BX Lore\n\nSo backstory over what is the lore behind this firm what do they do, well they are a classic private equity firm in the sense that everything you think private equity does they do expect they are the best at it. Like they are the amzn of the PE business. Ok great well what is private equity, its pretty self explantory but they take private money from pensions, trusts and high net worth individuals, consolidate it into a fund and then LEVER IT TO THE TITS and I do mean to the tits. You see the whole stick of private equity is kinda like this weird companation of the hedge fund business and the investment banking business. So they do deals that you would see in the investment banking sector like buyouts and real estate investment, which is a massive money maker. But they also act like a hedge fund with these funds by not only investing in hedge fund solutions but also actively investing in companies through credit lines and purchases of equities. The private equity firm in its simplist descripition is a hedge fund that wanted to grow up but didn't want to be regulated like a bank. So what is the reason for its meteoric rise well its because they have actually been devesting from investments made in years prior. The problem with going long a private equity firm when you hear about a big purchase by them is that the invest takes years to mature. So what I imagine is happening in this scenario is that Blackstone is devesting from the big investments they've been making the last decade or so and just dumping all these profitable businesses onto an inflated market thus raking in the dough. And as a nice result pumping the stock price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[quaterly earnings](https://preview.redd.it/397pgsngbsn71.png?width=339&format=png&auto=webp&s=7406e31b05aa1d3a34d2654017952dab3c9f716e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[yearly earnings](https://preview.redd.it/mzekxbyibsn71.png?width=340&format=png&auto=webp&s=639acd2bd4aafd5e19684b3f93ecbd52c927199f)\n\nThe Trade\n\nSo as you can see this year has been very good for $BX they have been making a consistant effort to devest from their most profitable businesses that are soaring during the market boom. I beleive this is going to continue to happen through the end of the year. I really don't think they are going to enter into to many deals simply because the market is so frothy which is a great thing for the stock as it will encourage steve to buyback or increase the divi so barring some economic jolt $BX does not have any forseeable headwinds. That being said right now all indicators are sayings its overbought as shit which is completely true it has been invincible these last couple of weeks. Personally I have some $120 dec. calls that I picked up about a week or so ago and have been holding on ever since taking profit as it runs but I plan on buying the next sign of weakness. As for the strategy its really very straight forward I own shares because I like the company and I going to buy calls during these long bull runs.
