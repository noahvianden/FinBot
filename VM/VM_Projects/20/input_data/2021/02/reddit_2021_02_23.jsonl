{"title": "Made a huge mistake by letting my options expire. Looking for guidance.", "selftext": "I'm feeling really silly today as I'm currently down $12K on a position that should've had a maximum loss potential of $670. Hoping for some advice. Here's the story (TLDR at the bottom):\n\nOn Friday I bought 2x TSLA 780c 19Feb21 for a total of $670.\n\n(Yes, these calls were going to expire later the same day)\n\nTSLA didn't recover as I thought it would, and it looked like the calls were going to expire worthless. No big deal, it's only $670.\n\nWell, at the last minute TSLA went up a bit and the calls expired ITM by $1.50. I didn't think much of it until Saturday when I saw I had an extra 200 shares of TSLA in my account and a margin call for over $30K. Still unfazed, I thought \"No problem, I'll just close the position Monday morning. Maybe I'll even be able to make a profit after all.\"\n\nImagine my surprise today when TSLA opens down 2.4% and keeps dropping ALL DAY LONG to a total decline of over 9%. This couldn't have happened on a better day!\n\nTo prevent the broker from selling everything, I deposited what cash I could, and sold many of my other positions that didn't drop as far. I sold 25 TSLA shares at $745, and my broker auto-sold another 25 at $734. I managed to satisfy the margin call while still holding 150 of the extra TSLA shares, but my account is now at 99% margin utilization.\n\nI'm currently down $12.4K on this position alone, not to mention the cost of closing my other positions at a loss and having no funds available to buy the dip.\n\nI'm not exactly sure where to go from here. TSLA was already my largest holding, and now it's over 1/3 of my entire net worth. However I'm extremely bullish on TSLA and would've used today's drop to buy more anyway, so I don't see it as that terrible having such a large position.\n\nI'm currently weighing the following options:\n\n1: HOLD! At least until TSLA returns to a price I think is close to reasonable (~$800)\n\n2: TRADE the extra 150 shares for 2 or 3 LEAP calls, and use the leftover funds to reduce margin and buy back the other positions I closed.  I won't miss out on a TSLA recovery and will feel safer having less outstanding margin. But it will hurt to sell at such a large loss.\n\n3: SELL most of the 150 shares, rebalance my portfolio, and significantly reduce margin. This will hurt as well, and severely limits my exposure to a TSLA recovery, but is by-far the safest. (No, I'm not really considering this, but I threw it in for completeness.)\n\nWhat would you do in this position?\n\nTLDR; Daytraded with $670 worth of call options, that ended up expiring ATM. Broker executes them automatically for $156K which triggers a margin call.

{"title": "(2/23) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News", "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday, February 23, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-23-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Nasdaq set to sink again as Big Tech slide continues\n\n> * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Tuesday, pointing to a 1.4% decline in the Nasdaq, one day after the index sank nearly 2.5% in its worst single-day drop in almost a month. Tech stocks continued to slide in Tuesday’s premarket, with Apple down another 2% after closing lower by nearly 3% Monday.\n\n> * Dow stock Home Depot dropped 2% in premarket trading on worries that Covid pandemic sales gains won’t last. A stock drop of that magnitude would put a major dent in modest year-to-date gains.\n\n> * The S&P 500 on Monday fell almost 0.8%, in a fifth straight decline, its worst losing streak in nearly a year. The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged bucked Monday’s downdraft, closing slightly higher. It’s doing so again Tuesday morning. All three stock benchmarks remained stronger for the month.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. Bond yields have been rising ahead of Powell’s testimony this week\n\n> * As part of mandated semiannual economic testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell goes to Capitol Hill twice this week, appearing Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. Rising bond yields and accompanying inflation fears are adding a higher level of interest around Powell’s remarks. The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, was slightly lower Tuesday morning,. But it’s been rising lately and trading around 1.36%. It was as high as 1.39% on Monday, the highest level in about a year.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Bitcoin sinks below $50,000; Tesla shares drop again\n\n> * Bitcoin plunged 12% Tuesday morning, sinking below $50,000. The world’s largest digital currency, still up 60% this year, hit an all-time high over $58,000 on Sunday. Price swings of more than 10% are not a rarity in crypto markets. Bitcoin once climbed to almost $20,000 in 2017 before shedding 80% the following year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday warned about those wild swings.\n\n> * Shares of Tesla, which earlier this month revealed an investment in bitcoin, fell another 6% in Tuesday’s premarket. The stock sank more than 8.5% on Monday, in its biggest drop since late September 2020. To be sure, other tech stocks also suffered heavy losses Monday. Ahead of trading Tuesday, shares of Elon Musk’s electric auto maker was up just 1.25% this year. However, over the past 12 months, Tesla was up nearly 300%.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. Home Depot, Macy’s report better than expected quarterly results\n\n> * Home Depot’s fourth-quarter earnings and revenue surged past expectations Tuesday, as consumers continued to invest in their homes due to the pandemic and strength of the real estate market. However, shares dropped on comments from Home Depot’s CFO, questioning how long the pandemic would last and how that may influence consumer spending.\n\n> * Shares of Macy’s rose more than 3.5% in the premarket after the retailer Tuesday morning reported its first quarterly profit in a year. Revenue in the fourth quarter also beat estimates as the company’s efforts to cut inventories during the holiday quarter and rely less on deep discounting paid off. Ahead of Tuesday’s trading, Macy’s shares were up 35% this year, though they struggled over the past 12 months.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. Electric automaker led by ex-Tesla engineer to go public\n\n> * Electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors plans to go public at an $11.75 billion combined equity valuation through a reverse merger with a blank-check company. The deal between California-based Lucid and Churchill Capital Corp IV is the largest in a series of such tie-ups involving EV companies and special purpose acquisition companies, better known as SPACs. Shares of CCIV fell more than 30% in the premarket. But speculation about the deal pushed the SPAC stock up 470% this year alone. Lucid is led by ex-Tesla engineering executive and automotive veteran Peter Rawlinson.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/nh32H4C.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wWFBkUD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/GqC0Wpr.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/TIhMYEf.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/rKXZEUq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/uT5kxuP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/X3QHyB3.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Xj9NIWe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ceMrg4D.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JwEoQ16.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/roUylhe.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ttppoOf.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/LwYb3Ms.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/gs9zcaT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/aBr8P6f.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS ON STOCKTWITS:\n\n* CCIV\n* TSLA\n* NIO\n* SPY\n* ARKK\n* BTC.X\n* QQQ\n* ETH.X\n* PLX\n* OCGN\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-home-depot-palo-alto-networks-shopify-amc.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Home Depot (HD)** – The home improvement retailer beat quarterly estimates by 3 cents with earnings of $2.65 per share.

{"title": "Ideas and plays in case we have a correction, a good thesis on why the correction as well. Good luck!", "selftext": "  \n\nThe people on the forums, had their vote, there is no need for me to wait a week, in just 1 day the reception of positive by far outweighed any negatives, and for the Stock forum with 2.3 million members that felt my posts were spam, I am sorry to lose 2.3 million eye balls.\n\n**You can skip this next paragraph and if you do not care about the thesis of why we may want to go defensive. NEW traders should read this and don't be offended think about why this is mentioned**\n\nOk back to the task at hand. There are no if and's about it, speculation and inflation have hit the markets. Historically the SP trades at about 22x PE (Which means the average stock on the 500 Index trades at 22x what is made per share), at the moment with the lovely inclusion of TSLA it is about 40. Yes, there are many other indexes but this is widely regarded as the most important one. I read many posts, and concerns about a correction, crash etc. I will say I do not believe their will be a crash but a 10% dip off the top of the SP is absolutely possible. How did this happen and why do I say that? In my 26 years of trading I have never seen the market come off so hard (Down 30% last March/April) and bounce back to record highs in months, never! It can take 2-3 years. I contribute this to 0 commissions, pandemic everyone at home, people can't go to casinos, easy access to money/stimulus, GME AMC mania everyone wants to be rich quick. I am very sorry to call out alot of new traders, I like to see people get interested in the market and come in with open hands and want to learn. I say welcome to the show. However I do not like the questions that are constantly asked..... So, I am new to this, how long will it take me to make 100,000 with 5,000.....I am thinking of quitting my job what do you think......What stock would be good to take my life savings.... What is the next GME/AMC......\n\nThere is an old saying on Wall st.,if your barber starts giving you stock picks, when your shoe shine person says to buy coins, usually that is a signal to be alert.\n\nWhen I have brand new traders trying to convince me why NIO is worth $100, (43,000 cars sold in 2020, 7,000 cars sold in January, Market CAP 90 Billion) while GM (8 Million cars sold 2020, nearly 1 Million sold in January, Market CAP 70 Billion) something is definitely wrong. Listen I love enthusiasm and I love new traders but this is not a game or casino. I have traded 26 years and I still have a W2, yes I do well, and trading has allowed me to have a business and own rental property but I still have a W2, at least for 5 more years. You should not treat this as a game and I recommend Index funds if you have a small amount and do not want to day trade. Why not a mutual fund or high flying ETF like ARK (Cathie Wood is a god!!) Because index funds have the lowest fees and over time they return close to 8% without hefty management fees/admin fees, the expense ratio isnt the only thing you look at! Wait what? You mentioned Cathie Wood isnt a god? You don't like ARK funds??? No, she has done well but ARK has been around for 6 years and before 2020 (When she was indeed hot) returned about 10% annualized, which is good but doesnt cause someone like me to say she is a rockstar, so you know her funds were down 9% yesterday, check the facts. I mention this because her holdings are horrifying. Stocks that did well have have insane PE's, SHOP (I like but last traded at 600), ZM (I like but last traded under 200), SPOT (I never liked since IPO), TSLA (You don't even want me to start), if she rotates who knows, but all these stocks you are paying a very high premium for something that may, or may not happen. So index funds it is! Now if you own these stocks and your outlook is 1+ years and you want to call me names, thats fine, they very well can be good plays long term, but for me I don't pay premiums for anything past 52 weeks. Good luck if you do. So to sum it up, the market is indeed frothy and don't quit your job if you are new to this....index funds if you are going to be passive.\n\nNow, yesterday my play was LDI, but if you read my thesis and idea, I was going in at 22, some of you did or lower and made a profit, kudos. I got in 1,000 shares (remember I still have 1,000 at 23.20 which I decided to hold Friday) I sold 500 shares at 22.25 but I am still holding 500 from 22, 1000 from 23.20. Now I did get some messages about this so I will go over this briefly. Please remember this is not financial advice this is a play by play of an experienced day trader. I am sorry if you read my post and wanted to go rogue and jump in at the open, my post did say I was waiting for a pullback of 22. I also mentioned clearly, remember these posts come out at 8am that there is a chance we may need to go defensive if the market is red. That said, lets look at LDI for people that think I steered them wrong.\n\nRKT which I love reports Thursday and may also show a light on this sector, it is regarded as the industry leader.\n\nThe most important this is this so I will put it in bold, and is why I am not concerned at all about LDI.\n\n**LDI as a whole has a market cap of 1.3 billion (The company is worth 1.3 Billion) LDI last quarter profit was 547 million!!!!!! So the market values the entire company for 1/3rd of what they made in just 3 months!! YES! Market isnt very smart so I take advantage**\n\nThat is not a typo, check the report. I am a day trader but I tell you, if you got in at 23 you should have no concern. I have 1,000 at 23.20 I am not worried, if you got in at 26 weeks ago, I got a message like this, you should not be concerned and yes you can average down and \"buy the dip\" Why? BECAUSE THE FUNDAMENTALS SAY SO!! NO, THIS ISNT GME OR AMC dont throw your life savings and average down every pay check. LDI and RKT are absolute gold mines because they are cash cows, how 33% of RKT is short absolutely blows my mind. Well, Ultimate why are people so negative on RKT why is it short, how come analysts hate it, exactly give me their job and pay me what I am worth!\n\nRKT will prove this again thursday and I will definitely trade it if it goes down to 20...I cashed out last week.\n\nIf you went defensive yesterday on ALL, you did great it dipped under 103 and went as high as 106.27. I exited and cashed out at 106 and 106.15.... Now this doesnt mean I am not bullish and won't trade back in, I will look to trade again maybe at 104....if it goes but that doesn't mean it will, no one controls the market.\n\nSo recap yesterday\n\nLDI - In at 22 sold half 22.25 still own half at 22 (Also have shares at 23.20)\n\nALL - Cashed out yesterday at 106 and 106.15, Will look to buy on a pullback\n\nToday will also have 1 defensive play in case the market is red... I am posting this about 7:30 AM\n\n**RXT Rackspace**\n\nRXT reported last week and the report was mediocre but got hammered on that report down over 20%.... Now some people will say what are you doing to us, a company with bad earnings? No, this wasnt the FSLY report or BA (1 of the top 5 worst ive seen in 26 years), I said this report was mediocre. The company revised estimates to 95 cents to 1.05 slightly below 1.11 estimate. No this isnt good but the stock was hammered and will have a below 20 or close PE. Remember before how I said the SP trades at 22 and now near 40? This is way over done, also RXT has been in business forever and just IPO'ed again, the company that originally bought it years ago paid 4.4 Billion and now its at 4.2 Billion and the company is profitable.. So whats my plan.\n\nIm looking to first enter on a dip maybe 19.75 to 20 but have to see what the market says at 9:30, I wont chase it I will wait at least 5 minutes after 9:30 which is what I call the shake out. I will look to sell at 2 different prices 25 cents to 1 dollar... Thats my plan\n\n**If we must go defensive**\n\n**CAH Cardinal Health**\n\nWhen the market corrects from previous history, usually big money moves out of high tech and starts flooding to low PE, Dividend stocks with -Beta. CAH trades at 7-8x PE has a 4% dividend and is in healthcare. I have also been trading this back and forth because the market just hates it!\n\nI actually just cashed out days ago at 52.40.... I am looking again if it dips and hoping to get in at 51 to 51.50 and trade this for 75 cents to a dollar... Thats my plan\n\nGOOD LUCK EVERYONE! Now remember this isnt me telling you what to do, I am not getting compensated, please do not blame me, these are trades I am about to make. If you do decide....\n\nLETS MAKE MONEY!!

It almost seems too good to be true. And because in large cap stocks the efficiency of the market is almost all the time on fleek, there is a reason why the market attributes a huge discount to the stock.\n\nFrom what I see or would assume is that this discount has its roots in the fact that it’s a Chinese Company. \nIf we measured the company by the ration e.g. amazon has (and amazon has these measurements rightly so), BABA would be worth double or triple it’s current market cap. \nThe reason for this discount is the political circumstances and the CCP.\n\nIf the CCP wanted, they could delist BABA, split it for antitrust reasons or for whatever reason they can make up, ban foreign investors from investing, prohibit the ADR rules or just simply destroy and dissolve the company. Not because there is a legal background to do so but just because it’s the CCP and China has basically no rule of law. \n\nSo the valuation of BABA is kinda arbitrary, you could assign it a 10 P/E, a 20 P/E, a 40 P/E or like amazon a 80 P/E. Everything is possible and it’s valuation is completely arbitrary. \n\nSo what prevents me from investing in Chinese ADRs is exactly this political factor that with the blink of an eye China could destroy the entire value for shareholders. We basically only hold a shell company with no substance whatsoever. \n\nAnd that btw is the same with all other ADRs from China (every China based stock is an ADR).

They sell it occasionally because of the concentration threshold they gave to maintain per their prospectus.\n\nTLDR; while you are 100% right retail investors should not blindly follow ARK, their buys and sells are completely discretionary and time driven.

{"title": "Array Technologies, Inc. (NASD: ARRY): A Solar Pureplay", "selftext": "#Company Description\n[Array Technologies](https://ibb.co/C6nyVHY) went public in October 2020, raising more than $1 billion at a valuation of $2.8 billion (1). The company manufactures tracking systems for utility-scale solar energy projects (2). Array Technologies has completed more than 900 of these projects in the past 30 years (3).\n\nArray mainly operates in the United States, generating 87% of their 2019 revenue in the country. More than 30% of U.S. utility-scale solar generation uses an Array product. Its second largest market is Australia at 8% of revenue (4). The company has installed its systems in 30 countries total (3). Its headquarters are in Albuquerque, New Mexico (4).\n\n#Products\nArray’s primary product is the [DuraTrack HZ v3 tracking system](https://ibb.co/vLccZPt). The DuraTrack platform works with the company’s SmarTrack software to automatically adjust solar modules in response to unique site terrain and weather conditions. SmarTrack is machine learning based, allowing significant adaptability (4). Note that Array’s combined DuraTrack-SmarTrack systems is currently its only product offering.\n\nThere are three main factors that influence demand for solar tracking systems:\n\n**1. Levelized cost of energy (LCOE)**\n\nCompanies have no incentive to purchase tracking systems when the cost of the tracking system outweighs the value of the additional energy generation. This means tracking systems are only viable in areas with high electricity costs. Expanding the areas of viability requires decreasing the cost of the tracking system.\n\nArray Technologies accomplishes this in a few ways:\n\n* Less than 1 motor is in use per MW (5)\n* A single tracker block maneuvers 32 rows with 100+ modules (5)\n* Uses few moving parts and the design is quite simple (5)\n* SmarTrack requires no additional sensors or hardware (6)\n\nThe above design choices allow Array to provide trackers that generate the highest amount of energy possible without major tracking costs. It is important to note that the most effective solar tracker on an energy basis is often not the most effective on a cost basis. Array seems to effectively balance between efficiency and product cost. In fact, the DuraTrack system is independently verified to achieve 6.7% lower LCOE than competitors (4).\n\n**2. Operation and Maintenance (O&M)**\n\nIt is important that solar modules utilizing tracking systems have high uptimes so the cost of the tracking system is further recouped. Additionally, repair costs for tracking systems can make their purchase unappealing.\n\nArray’s DuraTrack boasts a 99.996% uptime thanks to its few moving parts (7). The DuraTrack system requires no scheduled maintenance (5). Array provides several case studies proving the product’s durability, including its operation in the high-corrosion environment of Jordan (8).\n\nDuraTrack’s durable design also includes a fully mechanical wind-load mitigation system. It is the only solar tracker to use such an automatic system without using sensors or electricity (4).\n\n**3. Installation Labor and Costs**\n\nArray Technologies lowered installation cost through 3 single-bolt module clamp designs. Notably, the company claims its RapidClamp design requires just 11 seconds per installation. Fast installation times greatly reduce the total cost of installing the DuraTrack system (7).\n\n#Leadership and Ownership\nRon Corio ([pictured](https://ibb.co/c2Sf7Fg)) is the founder of Array Technologies and currently serves on the board, after being CEO from 1989 to 2018 (4). Corio is considered a pioneer of solar tracking as he is among the first to develop such a system (20). Corio holds 10% of the company's shares and is the second largest shareholder (10).\n\nMr. James M. Fusaro is the CEO of Array Technologies, serving in the role since Corio’s mid-2018 retirement (4). Previously, Mr. Fusaro served as President of Advanced Materials at Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE: HON). In this role, Fusaro oversaw the $3 billion Honeywell Performance Materials & Technology business. He has also held executive roles at Avnet (NASD: AVT) and Amkor Technologies (NASD: AMKR). These positions all contribute to Fusaro’s lengthy experience in electronics, semiconductors, and manufacturing. He also has over a decade experience as an engineer (9).\n\nFusaro purchased 182,772 shares of ARRY in October 2020 at $22 per share for a total cost of $4,020,984 (11). In total, Fusaro owns around 1% of the company (10).\n\nInstitutions hold 78% of Array Technologies; the largest holder is Fidelity Investments at 15% of shares. Other holders include AllianceBernstein, Blackrock, the Bank of New York Mellon, and Neuberger Berman Group at over 1% each (12). Array’s stock fell in December 2020 after Oaktree Capital Management sold a significant portion of its position in the company. The selling of these shares is understandable as Oaktree owned a significant percentage of Array through its subsidiary, ATI Intermediate Holdings (13).\n\n#Outlook and Strategy\nThe outlook for the solar industry is very promising. Solar is the fastest growing form of electricity generation in the United States. Analysts project the solar industry to grow earnings 32% annually over the next five years (17).\n\nEstimations indicate U.S. installations of ground-mounted solar generation capacity will reach a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16%. Array sees several tailwinds for the industry: regulation of fossil fuels, decreasing solar energy costs, growing support for clean energy initiatives, and accelerating deployment of utility-scale batteries (4).\n\nSpecific to Array’s market, U.S. installations of trackers for 1+ megawatt systems are growing at a CAGR of 35%. Array’s products are now present on more than 1 in 4 solar modules installed in the U.S. to date (5). Over 50% of utility-scale solar projects use tracking systems in the United States (14). Array Technologies is positioning itself to achieve more of this market share.\n\nArray Technologies is executing a three part growth strategy:\n\n* **Gain market share in the company’s core U.S. business:** Array’s order book increased by 31% year-over-year from Q3 2019 to Q3 2020 (15).\n\n* **Expand internationally:** In the last nine months of 2020 the company increased its international footprint by over 50% (15).\n\n* **Perform bolt-on acquisitions:** As of their Q3 2020 earnings call, Array is currently pursuing several acquisition targets (15).\n\nArray’s existing revenues have protection through the company’s patents on its DuraTrack system and components. The company’s linked-row, rotating gear drive system also has patent protection until 2030. The patent protects their single-axis tracking system that uses just one electric motor to drive the rotation of multiple rows of solar modules using articulated driveline joints. The patent also protects DuraTrack’s wind-mitigation stowing system. The company believes its patents force competitors to use less efficient designs, maintaining Array’s competitive advantage (4).\n\n#Competitors\nNEXTracker Inc. is Array’s main competitor and also the largest solar tracking company in the world. NEXTracker is a subsidiary of Flex Ltd. (NASD: FLEX) after its acquisition in 2014. Flex’s stock rose significantly after Array’s IPO, indicating NEXTracker being further priced into Flex’s valuation.\n\nFlex does not report individual financial data for NEXTracker in its filings. This makes it difficult to perform a fundamental comparison between the two. However, analyzing the difference in their products provides valuable insight.\n\nNEXTracker’s solar trackers use one motor per row of solar panels, compared with DuraTrack’s one motor for several rows. NEXTracker’s use of more motors leads to increased cost and is one reason for Array’s superior LCOE, although NEXTracker’s systems are more advanced technically. NEXTracker is unable to switch to a single-motor system because of Array’s patents. IArray Technologies is currently in litigation concerning an ex-employee who allegedly shared trade secrets with NEXTracker in violation of a non-compete agreement (4).\n\nCompetitively, Array’s only real moat is its patents which expire in 2030. The company does have certain product advantages over NEXTracker because of DuraTrack’s lower cost, simplicity, LCOE, and wind mitigation system. Array’s patents on these systems will eventually expire. It is also possible that competitors mirror these features without infringing on Array’s patents (4). Investors should be aware of Array’s low/non-existent moat.\n\n#Financials\nArray Technologies is working to decrease product costs while drastically increasing revenues and profits. The company is already profitable with positive free cash flow. The table below illustrates Array’s revenues, earnings, and cash flows (18).\n\nCategory|TTM|2019|2018\n:--|:--|:--|:--\nTotal Revenue|975,116|647,899|290,783\nGross Profit|248,141|150,761|11,555\nOperating Income|171,402|83,409|-61,206\nNet Income|121,046|39,745|-60,764\nNormalized EBITA|196,502|110,692|-33,203\nOperating Cash Flow|141,016|386,073|-11,727\nFree Cash Flow|139,488|384,376|-18,157\n\nArray Technologies’ 2019 revenue was $647,899,000, growing 123% over 2018. Array has grown revenues 51% in the trailing 12 months. Margins have increased since 2017, with the exception of a 3% increase due to COVID-19 supply chain disruptions (15). Currently, gross margins are at just over 25% (18).\n\nArray holds $27.14 million in cash and carries very little debt. The company is not at risk of insolvency with a current ratio of 1.8 and Debt/Equity of 0.03. Array is using its low-debt status to pursue bolt-on acquisitions and has the cash pile to do so (19).\n\nARRY trades at ratios of 51.33 P/E, 5.40 P/S, and 2.09 PEG (18). These valuation metrics are inline or slightly higher than the industry averages of 59.32 P/E, 4.53 P/S, and 1.85 PEG (17). Fundamentally, the valuation appears high but Array’s extreme growth in revenue and earnings makes it seem more reasonable. The company’s valuation is inline with other companies in the solar industry and growing faster.\n\nThe mean price target for ARRY is $51.05 which translates to a ~30% upside. The lowest price target is $37 from Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Credit Suisse (NYSE: CS). The highest price target is $60 from Piper Sandler (NYSE: PIPR) (21). \n\n#Risks\nThere are many risks to consider before investing in Array Technologies. These risks include but are not limited to:\n\n* Array Technologies is reliant on the success of a single product\n\n* Array does not have a significant (if any) moat\n\n* Array has a high valuation due to its growth, which may stop or slow\n\n* ARRY is an extremely volatile stock\n\n* The company releases its fourth quarter and full-year 2020 earnings report on March 9th, 2021\n\n* Major shareholders selling could cause the stock to fall\n\n* Low reviews on Glassdoor; employee morale may be low following management changes (22)\n\n* Competitors, like NEXTracker, could take market share from Array\n\n#Disclaimer\nI do not provide investment advice of any kind and I am not a qualified licensed investment advisor.

I'm quite new to investing, my first shares being bought in january 2020 (it was apple) and we all know what happened starting january/february . In no time, the portfolio was something like -60% :)). I knew very few things but i knew not to panic sell and just ride with it, and it turned out to be a great decision. Now, since then, i've constantly made small purchases every know and then (regardless of how the market was doing) and here is how my portfolio is divided (i started investing knowing that i don't need this money in the near future, so i wanna do mostly, if not all, just buy and hold for as long as i can, big/stable companies. I don't wanna try to time the market or day trade (not that i even know how that works lol) ). Here it is:\n\n**23%** \\- Nvidia    **22%** \\- Apple     **14%** \\- Google     **9.2%** \\- Mastercard     **6.7%** \\- Amazon     **6.6%** \\- Microsoft     **6.4%** \\- NextEra Energy     **4.7%** \\- Tesla     **4.4%** \\- Visa     **3.5%** \\- Boeing\n\nHad pretty good returns on everything so far (best ones on Nvidia and Apple) so although these days were rough, everything it's still in green so i'm pretty happy with that, BUT, i see everything now as a good opportunity to buy at \"sale prices\". But rather than buying more of the stocks i have, i feel like i wanna use this opportunity to diversify the portfolio a little bit (i feel like it's too much towards the tech; by all means correct me if it's not the case here). I kept looking at Coca Cola and Disney (i see this keep going up especially in the coming years, in the idea of everything coming back to normal) for some time now, but i don't know if i should get them or not. Now my question is: If YOU would have this portfolio, what would you buy to diversify it (i don't know, maybe more towards health-care, more consumer , etc) .

{"title": "Key upcoming market considerations, GME, bonds, Powell, stimulus", "selftext": "1. We have been going through a minor correction the last few days due to rapid rising of bond yields and so there will be a lot of focus on Powell's hearing tomorrow and Thursday. My feeling is that Powell will continue to be consistent in his message that his priority is to boost the economy/market and that inflation is not a concern at this moment and that there is no consideration of rising interest rates. If this does happen, I think we will go right back into heavy green the rest of the month. There are a lot of ppl smarter than me on WSB so I'd love to hear contrary opinions or agreements or whatever you all think.\n2. Do not expect hedge funds in any shape or form to get punished or held accountable by any government agency. It is all a show. We cannot count on any government incompetent and corrupt officials to do anything to make things fair.  If you need proof, just go back and look at the Bernie Maddoff story. The one Greek financial analyst reported fraud TEN times to the SEC for like 8 years in a row. In some ways, he was kind of like the DFV before DFV, another legend but a different situation. Regardless, the SEC did NOTHING each time. Maddoff was a hedge fund guy operating a HUGE 20B+ ponzi scheme and still the SEC did NOTHING. The only reason he was even actually caught was when the credit crunch caused the ponzi scheme to fall apart and Maddoff turned himself in. The SEC Is a bunch of pansies when it comes to going after the rich. They are owned by the rich. They only come after the smaller poorer people. The other hedge funds new it was fraud too but the only reason they didn't complain was out of fear that their own fraud would be exposed by brining in regulators. The vast majority of hedge funds are all BS and a house of cards. There is no government agencies that will do shit against them ever. We apes/autists/retards are all we have and we must continue to do the work and fight. We must beat them at their own game with better data and better research. This is just a discussion board but its up to each of us individually to make the best decisions that make sense for each of your respective situations. But pay attention to what those hedge funds do, what public info they release, what they are shorting, etc. Beat them at their own game and bang their wives as you are doing it. THAT is the goal. \n3. Despite point #2, there is plenty of hope and I am optimistic about GME. Remember, these hedge funds also shorted Tesla all year long as admitted by hedge fund douche Gabe last week. Surely, they tried manipulation there too in order to artificially keep the price down. But, Tesla was and is too strong. They could not keep it down forever and then they eventually had to pay the price which initiated a whole bunch of short squeezes as Tesla mooned to crazy highs. I'm not saying GME is guaranteed to follow that path but, with some good news from RC and with some solid strategic steps, GME can break out. It just needs some catalysts and then some momentum. Patience is key here for those who truly believe in GME as I do. Earnings is coming up in March and some good news could go a long way in sparking another gamma squeeze. I will point out that, even though Melvin shorted Tesla last year, they still had a very solid year and made a lot of money, I believe I read it was around $500M for 2020 so they will still find other ways to manipulate other things to cover themselves. Whether its using their media puppets, their short reporting buddies like Shitron, short ladders, ETF underhanded shorting or whatever else, they have a lot of shady dirty tools in their bag.  Regardless, when it comes to GME, we can still win this battle if we believe in GME. This is not financial advice and people should only be all in if they believe in GME and can afford to be in it.\n4. The stimulus looms large. Congress has estimated a stimulus delivered around March.  Some say it is already priced in but I don't agree.  I think the combination of the stimulus combined with market reopening has the potential to really take this market to record new highs. This however will  not last for the whole year IMHO because inflation concerns will certainly creep up again once we get to the highs.  If my predictions come true and we do get record highs, it will be time to consider the \"Sell in May and Go Away\" philosophy.  I will admit this is prediction is just an estimated guess and I again invite those who are much smarter than me to weigh in on whether they agree with this prediction or things its completely off base. \n5. Mining stocks like MARA and Riot are interesting and I am watching them. Ever since Telsa announced its investment, there has been wild speculation that Apple could follow. Perhaps it is better to just buy the coin instead of the mining companies. That I do not know. I will say that I think it is absolutely a strong possibility that one day these coins will replace the US dollar as the global reserve currency.  Maybe I am just retarded in thinking that but I think its possible.  \n\nThat is all I got. I again invite all those who are far  smarter than me to rip apart any of these points or to agree with me or to just comment their expertise. And, most importantly of all, by far, I will end with one thing......I LIKE THIS STOCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "id": "lq9ldw", "created_utc": 1614055834.0, "score": 77, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is a GameStop dispensary.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Well go do your DD if you don’t understand why. Or go look look at the SPY max, and when the interest rates go up and Compare them.   \n\n\n**Effect JPOW had today:** \n\nJPOW, stood by his guns and said that the interest rates will not increase for the near future. Even with the future rises of inflation, due to the base standard and the increase in demand from the opening up post covid.  \nHe also said something interesting and insightful of when we will see Interest rates rise. When Unemployment goes down. Some background information is that before COVID the Fed was constantly talking about how minorities and lower wealth people were adding to the recovery of the Economic state of the US.   \nI personally don’t think JPOW is going to hike interest rates until the unemployment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Strategy:** \n\nI think there is going to be a major pull back 10% or so in the economy when people see heightened inflation rates this April or May.

When the lower quartile of wealths unemployment decreases to near average or TOtal unemployment rates, I will probably enter bear mode, and buy PUTs on the majority of the market.

My understanding of the former is that you can only be evicted for reasons unrelated to financial problems (i.e. engaging in criminal behavior will still get you evicted).\n\nObviously, when the rubber hits the road, nothing is perfect. Entropy, etc. I imagine that some renters are being evicted when they shouldn't be, and that some homeowners are asking for forbearance when they haven't really been impacted, but I can see a future in which \"UBI\" as defined above is implemented through some permanently-renewed system of subsidies that arises as the result of all this financial jiggery. \n\nAnyway, if you can shed some light on that figure of 1,000,000+ rental evictions you mention I'm interested in reading more.
