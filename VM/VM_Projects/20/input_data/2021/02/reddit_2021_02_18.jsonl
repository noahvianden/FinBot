{"title": "Piedmont Lithium Deep Dive (NASDAQ: PLL ASX: PLL): Tesla, Sayona, Metso Outotec and an American Lithium Supply Chain", "selftext": "Disclosure: I have an open long position in PLL and plan to keep for several years. The following IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE and is for information purposes ‚Äì My Position Disclosed.\n\nI've spent the past 8 months researching this US based lithium company after seeing it on the [EV Stock channel on YouTube](https://youtu.be/Dvc0kiUvIfw). I don't see many deep dives or content in general on PLL like I do for the other prospective lithium companies like Lithium Americas (NYSE:LAC) and so I wanted to share my research and why I'm bullish on the stock and why others who believe that electric vehicle demand will go vertical this decade should consider investing in Piedmont Lithium (NASDAQ: PLL, ASX: PLL).\n\nThis is not to say the other companies are not worthwhile investments, only that PLL to me seems to be a great stock where its current market cap makes it a better deal than most and one that still has plenty of upside from today‚Äôs $55 share price (February 2021). Fintwit likes to compare resource sizes between prospective lithium companies and extrapolate from there that one asset will dominate and is the only one worth investing in and they deem it irrational to invest in anything other than their favorite stock. Even though this post is only about PLL, the truth is we‚Äôll probably need all of the lithium juniors to be successful in order to transition the world‚Äôs vehicle fleet off fossil fuels. To me, PLL‚Äôs recent history, future prospects, and its current market cap make PLL simply *a better deal* than others at this point in time and is worth considering as an investment.\n\nI started buying PLL around $6 ($65M market cap) in Summer 2020 and it went \\~7x by October 2020 having gained project validation through a supply deal with Tesla. There's also more to the Tesla relationship as well since Tesla is building a lithium hydroxide plant in Texas and there are some synergies that PLL should benefit from (to skip forward to this part, see section #3 Tesla‚Äôs New Take on Lithium Hydroxide).\n\nThis post is lengthy so here's a ‚ÄúTable of Contents‚Äù and I‚Äôve also broken and bolded the section headings as you scroll down:\n\n1. Brief Company Overview\n2. Bullish Investment Thesis\n3. Tesla‚Äôs New Take on Lithium Hydroxide with Metso Outotec and PLL\n4. Sayona-Piedmont Deal Explained\n5. Upcoming Near Term Expected News That Can Drive PLL Higher\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**1. Brief Company Overview**\n\nPiedmont Lithium is a prospective North American lithium mining and chemical plant company with planned operations in North Carolina, 30 miles west of Charlotte. PLL hopes to sell into the North American EV battery supply chain to companies like LG Chem, SK Innovation, BASF, and Umicore in addition to Tesla.\n\nPLL plans to start mining pegmatites on their own land in 2022, crushing, sorting, and concentrating it into SC6 (spodumene concentrate 6% Li2O) and will then start chemical operations in 2023, converting SC6 into lithium hydroxide. Piedmont will also be buying SC6 from Sayona Mining, another prospective lithium company in Quebec, Canada, as feedstock into Piedmont's hydroxide chemical plant. This is to keep up the ‚Äútons per year‚Äù throughput capacity of the chemical plant. Lastly, PLL has a deal with Tesla for its North Carolinian SC6 to feed Tesla's own lithium hydroxide plant near Giga Austin.\n\nThere are mainly two types of lithium chemicals sold to battery and cathode makers: lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide. Growth for hydroxide is expected to outpace carbonate because hydroxide is used in higher energy dense and therefore higher nickel content batteries like [Tesla‚Äôs 4680 cells that will go into the Cybertruck and Tesla Semi](https://youtu.be/l6T9xIeZTds?t=4199). Hydroxide can withstand higher temperatures compared to carbonate when sintering with the nickel + \"other metals\" precursors. Hydroxide is also tougher to deal with compared to carbonate and hydroxide has a shorter shelf life, but hydroxide is expected to continue to sell at a premium compared to carbonate. Carbonate‚Äôs main feedstock is brine and hydroxide‚Äôs main feedstock is spodumene due to cost of conversion although you can make either carbonate or hydroxide from either brine or spodumene if the price is right.\n\nToday, PLL is currently domiciled in the Australian Stock Exchange with a [conversion that you can buy in the US called ADRs](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/PLL:NASDAQ) (American Depository Receipts) where each ADR = 100 Ordinary Shares. All of my math below in section #2 was using the ADR share count. It‚Äôs the same ticker in either Australian or US stock exchanges (PLL). One benefit so far was you get a lot more trading hours since Australia is +14hrs (6PM ET ASX trading open).\n\nHowever, this is changing. Since the project is American, the management is mostly American, and they‚Äôll sell into the North American market, [PLL is currently in the process of re-domiciling](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_9ad2aee07b47d44421d3191a6b666a51/piedmontlithium/db/336/2642/pdf/2154035.pdf) to the US which should be completed in March/April 2021 timeframe. After the re-domicile, each ADR shareholder will get 1 new ordinary share so it basically won‚Äôt have a material effect. They‚Äôll also do a secondary listing in Australia and basically for every 100 former outstanding shares, Australians will get 1 new CDI, CHESS depositary interest, but again it basically won‚Äôt have a material effect. The basis for doing this is to shore up the American thematic for investors and possibly for loans, qualify for indexes like the Russell 2000, and make it easier should a company want to invest into or buy PLL.\n\nFinally, regarding the actually numbers, Piedmont Lithium plans to:\n\n* Produce in North Carolina 160,000 tons SC6 per year for 25 years with their own mine and concentrate plant\n* Buy 60,000 tons or more of SC6 per year from Sayona Mining (Quebec) for the life of their mine (with options to increase as Sayona‚Äôs resources increase)\n* Produce 22,700 tons of lithium hydroxide per year for 25 Years, converting the SC6 from North Carolina and Sayona Quebec.\n* Sell to Tesla \\~53,000 tons of SC6 per year for 5 years with an option for an additional 5 years\n* Sell to battery/cathode companies the 22,700 tons of lithium hydroxide per year to make bank\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**2.

[There are about 6 major lithium producing companies today](https://twitter.com/LithiumIonBull/status/1356038874972233730/photo/1) supplying to the EV battery space and their market caps range from $20-$25B (Albemarle and Ganfeng), $11-$15B (Tianqi and SQM) and $1B-$3B (Orocobre and Livent).\n\nA standard valuation metric when analyzing mining companies is using [EV/EBITDA multiples](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072715/what-considered-healthy-evebitda.asp), EV being Enterprise Value in this context, not Electric Vehicles. EV is nothing more than Market Cap plus Debt or Loans minus Cash in Bank. You basically use a bunch of assumptions, solve for Market Cap and then use this figure to divide by estimated shares outstanding to get a target share price. You need to discount the future EBITDA expectation back into today‚Äôs dollars which is sort of like reverse compounding interest.\n\nSo back to PLL, using the below assumptions, I see **PLL conservatively as a $1.33B market cap** company or **with an aggressive multiple, it could be a $2.25B market cap** company (versus the $760M market cap it is today). Since you can‚Äôt make market cap out of thin air, I assumed a 40% share dilution along with taking on debt to fund the project. Why 40% dilution? From today‚Äôs market cap, that would equal about half of their funding needs of about $600M total where the other half would be financed with low interest debt. This all equates to a target **$69 diluted share price for the $1.33B MC or $116 diluted share price for $2.25B MC**. Again, **PLL trades today around $55 per share**.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nMath details follow, skip ahead if not interested.\n\n2028 EV/EBITDA Multiple = 12.5\n\n2028 Est. EBITDA (see note below) = $210M\n\nDiscount rate = 8%\n\nDebt = $300M (50% of $600M project cost)\n\nCash = $100M (working capital estimate)\n\n2021 Shares Outstanding = 13.85M shares\n\n2028 Share Dilution = 40%\n\nEV = Market Cap + Debt ‚Äì Cash,\n\nSolving for MC = EV ‚Äì Debt + Cash\n\nEV/EBITDA = 12.5 and solving for EV = EBITDA \\* 12.5\n\nBringing into today‚Äôs dollars using 8%:\n\n2021 EV = EV / (1.08)\\^7 = (EBITDA\\*12.5) / (1.08)\\^7 = $1.532B\n\n2021 MC = 2021 EV ‚Äì Debt + Cash = $1.532B - $300M + $100M = $1.3 B\n\nWith an additional 40% share dilution: 13.85M \\* 1.4 = 19.4M\n\n$1.33B / 19.4 M = $69 per share\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*EBITDA Note: I did my own future cashflow for life of mine (25 years) and used these assumptions for EBITDA: $12,700 per ton hydroxide battery grade, $9,000 per ton hydroxide non-battery grade, $600 per ton SC6, AISC $6,000 per ton hydroxide, $300 per ton SC6 mining, 8:1 conversion ratio of SC6 to LiOH, 30/60/90% 3 year ramp up to 80% end-to-end battery-grade nameplate hydroxide production. Note the $12.7K is arguably super conservative for hydroxide prices for the middle of this decade and beyond.\n\nDone with the detailed math.\n\n\\*\\*\n\nIf instead you do a **20x multiple for EV/EBITDA**, same assumptions above, the **potential market cap is $2.25B which is $116 per diluted share!**\n\nIs a 12.5x or 20x a reasonable EV/EBITDA multiple? Today the lithium producing companies mentioned are trading 17x - 34x 2022 EBITDA projections.\n\nAll of this is to say if PLL executes and produces, the market already values lithium companies with these kinds of multiples.\n\nSo now the question is can PLL execute?\n\nHere is where the Tesla deal comes in. Tesla [settled on spodumene-to-lithium hydroxide](https://youtu.be/l6T9xIeZTds?t=4482) for their own path forward for near term lithium needs because of its scalability and sustainability. Most everyone remembers the ‚Äútable salt + clay = instant lithium\" talk from Battery Day but the presentation slides and the PLL deal in the aftermath made it clear their near term development and capital expenditures will be for spodumene-to-hydroxide. And for this project, they presumably reviewed many existing and upcoming spodumene miners and concluded that PLL in North Carolina was their best partner.\n\nAfter the Tesla offtake announcement, PLL was able to raise $57 million in a 2% share dilution offering (market cap alone was $65 million when I started reading up on the company in Summer 2020) and this kickstarted the work needed to bring the project on the cusp of completing definitive feasibility studies, final investment decision, and construction start.\n\nPLL still needs to raise the actual $600M in project financing to complete the mine, ore concentrator, and lithium hydroxide chemical plant, which is A LOT of capex. Sources of funding could vary such as Dept of Energy loans and companies inside or outside the battery industry, but it looks like there is no better time than now to be investing in the battery metals space. The sales pitch is pretty compelling where the impetus for doing this PLL project is to sell into a lithium hydroxide market that is expected to grow from 80,000 tons per year in 2020 to 2 million tons by 2030 or even earlier. If PLL builds their 22,700 tons per year chemical plant and gets qualified to sell to cathode/battery makers, PLL will sell out of inventory.\n\nBut wait there‚Äôs more! All of the above numbers are using PLL‚Äôs currently announced plans. PLL has said they[ plan to be a bigger business](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/020221-expect-lithium-supply-crunch-by-2025-as-ev-market-booms-piedmont-ceo) and they‚Äôre starting to make moves to show this, like through their [recent investment and spodumene concentrate offtake deal](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_9ad2aee07b47d44421d3191a6b666a51/piedmontlithium/db/336/2643/pdf/2163907.pdf) of their own with Quebec junior mining company Sayona Mining.\n\nWith Sayona, Piedmont signed not only an offtake for 60,000 tons of SC6 per year for *life of mine* (or 50% of Sayona output should Sayona produce more), they also took a \\~20% equity stake in the parent company and partnered with their lithium project, now owning 25% at the asset level of Sayona Quebec subsidiary. So \\~20% in Sayona shares and 25% business ownership for the Quebec mine, all for a total of $12M USD where they also get a board seat and at least project consensus rights.\n\nFinally, with all of the above there is also the backdrop of Biden‚Äôs Build Back Better and the monumental transition from ICE to EVs this decade. Tesla showed the way and now every automaker has plans to offer EVs of their own and now countries are announcing their [phase-out dates of ICE vehicle sales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles) some as soon as 2027.\n\nIn the transition to a battery energy economy, you can imagine the US Government would not want to shift an oil dependency controlled by OPEC to a battery raw materials dependency controlled by China. Therefore, North American friendly and, even better, US based mining companies should benefit from this sentiment.\n\nNot only are the emissions from vehicles under scrutiny but also the supply chain as well. Today, [80% of lithium hydroxide comes from China](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/033020-us-far-too-reliant-on-chinese-lithium-american-battery-ceo). China imports most of its spodumene SC6 feedstock from Australia, converts it to hydroxide hundreds of miles inland, which is then shipped back out to Japan, Korea, and the rest of the cathode/battery world which then makes it into an EV. This equates to a ton of CO2 emissions and [Tesla highlighted this \"kg x km\" metric](https://youtu.be/l6T9xIeZTds?t=4482) as a figure of merit when they were considering their raw material sourcing strategy.\n\nPLL is a North American project that will supply the North American supply chain but could also supply the European battery supply chain as well (North Carolina is a lot closer to the battery factories in Europe than China is). Again, should PLL produce, it seems they will easily sell out of inventory.\n\nSo from the bull side, investing in PLL, a US domestic lithium producer, could be like investing in Standard Oil when the Model T came out in the 1900s.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**3. Tesla‚Äôs New Take on Lithium Hydroxide with Metso Outotec and Piedmont Lithium**\n\n**Key Takeaways:**\n\n* **Tesla has not publicly disclosed what companies they‚Äôre working with or flowsheet details they‚Äôre considering for their spodumene-to-lithium hydroxide chemical plant in Texas**\n* **There are public comments where Metso Outotec (a Finnish chemical equipment company) and Tesla are mentioned to be working together**\n* **Big market potential for companies involved if Outotec flowsheet becomes the industry standard with ‚Äúsulfate free‚Äù and sulfuric acid free process. Today, sulfuric acid roast is the primary flowsheet by industry leaders Albemarle, Ganfeng, and Tianqi**\n* **Outotec process is in line with Tesla‚Äôs more environmentally friendly approach with the potentially huge benefit that it can also yield +20% better recoveries from spodumene than sulfuric acid roasting (**[**see Critical Elements study**](https://www.cecorp.ca/en/critical-elements-successfully-produces-battery-grade-lithium-hydroxide-in-pilot-plant-testing/)**)**\n* **Dave Buckley, VP Process Engineer for Piedmont Lithium talks about the ‚Äúpressure leaching‚Äù process, which is the Outotec process, prior to Tesla Battery Day in July 2020 on Joe Lowry‚Äôs The Global Lithium podcast calling it an elegant solution but non-commercial scale today. Seems right up Tesla‚Äôs alley and primed to disrupt the existing hydroxide industry.**\n\nTesla could be aiming to disrupt another industry, this time setting their sights on the lithium chemicals supply chain. They don‚Äôt simply repeat what‚Äôs always been done but going back to first principles to find scalable and elegant solutions. The same seems to apply to their lithium hydroxide plans in Texas.\n\nAt Battery Day, [Tesla highlighted a ‚Äúsulfate free‚Äù lithium hydroxide processing plant](https://youtu.be/l6T9xIeZTds?t=4482), co-located with a cathode facility, to supply Giga Austin and the new 4680 cells. They signed a spodumene feedstock deal with Piedmont Lithium to supply the plant with SC6, [highlighting their sustainably mined/sourced ore](https://youtu.be/l6T9xIeZTds?t=4449) principles.\n\nThrough some online investigating, Tesla seems to be forging ahead with Metso Outotec‚Äôs novel pressure leaching lithium hydroxide process:\n\n* Ana Cabral-Gardner from Sigma Lithium during [5@5 Mines and Money YouTube interview from Sept 29 2020](https://youtu.be/QWryxVESZTY?t=3379):\n\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre very excited about the pioneering that Tesla and Piedmont (Lithium) are doing because it pushes the industry forward. Typical Tesla it‚Äôs the Silicon Valley speed forcing an industry like mining and chemicals, which are typically slow, to kind of move on that speed‚Ä¶so the Outotec route that the Finnish had been trying and playing with for a while, Tesla was like ‚ÄòOK I‚Äôll just do it, I‚Äôm going to follow that route and I‚Äôm just going to do it‚Äô‚Ä¶They are actually doing this industry a tremendous tremendous tremendous favor by just charging ahead as always‚Äù\n\n* Evercore February 9 2021 PLL Research Note [Posted on Twitter](https://twitter.com/LithiumIonBull/status/1359177010220834817):\n\n‚ÄúWe dug a little deeper on the process being considered (Outotec) which looks to offer a number of cost, efficiency, and sustainability benefits vs traditional LiOH conversion technologies‚Äù\n\n[Outotec](https://www.outotec.com/) is a Finnish company that specializes in chemical processing equipment for gold, zinc, nickel, and now battery chemicals like lithium hydroxide and carbonate.\n\nToday, most of the lithium hydroxide produced by Albemarle, Tianqi, Ganfeng uses a sulfuric acid roasting flowsheet. [Outotec‚Äôs process](https://www.outotec.com/globalassets/newsletters/hydromet/issue-1-2019/alta2019---tiihonen-lp059.pdf) is environmentally sustainable, sulfate and acid free and [over 20% more efficient compared to sulfuric acid roasting](https://www.cecorp.ca/en/critical-elements-successfully-produces-battery-grade-lithium-hydroxide-in-pilot-plant-testing/) in converting spodumene to hydroxide, meaning more hydroxide for the same spodumene concentrate (‚Äú80% Outotec vs 65% market benchmark‚Äù where 23% = 15%/65%).\n\nOutotec‚Äôs hydroxide test work has appeared in the feasibility studies of other spodumene junior mining companies Keliber ([DFS](https://www.keliber.fi/site/assets/files/1889/executive_summary_of_the_updated_definitive_feasibility_study_id_17398.pdf) and [Press Release](https://im-mining.com/2020/02/18/outotec-test-work-stacks-keliber-lithium-project/)) and [Critical Elements](https://www.cecorp.ca/en/critical-elements-successfully-produces-battery-grade-lithium-hydroxide-in-pilot-plant-testing/). The Outotec process may have been on Tesla‚Äôs radar from these feasibility studies published between 2018-2019.\n\nOutotec‚Äôs process is also highly respected by Dave Buckley, a star lithium processing engineer with a resume that includes working for FMC (now Livent), Rockwood Lithium (now Albemarle), Critical Elements, and, since Jan 2018, VP Process Engineer at none other than Piedmont Lithium!\n\nIn July, [Dave was interviewed by Joe Lowry](https://anchor.fm/globallithium/episodes/Episode-72-Dave-Buckley-egsev9/a-a2nlroh) on The Global Lithium Podcast, arguably the most popular lithium discussion on the Internet (Outotec Pressure Leaching discussion starts at 34:55 mark).\n\nDave called the pressure leaching process ‚Äúelegant‚Äù and ‚Äúmuch less environmentally impactful‚Äù:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* ‚ÄúThe process that I‚Äôve seen that I think is an extremely elegant process is the pressure leaching process that years and years ago in the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs they did up in Canada where they took the roasted spodumene, mixed it with soda ash, put it in autoclaves, you get lithium carbonate and basically sand, what they call analcime or sodium aluminosilicate. (This) comes out and then you bicarbonate that and then filter the solids off, heat the solution up again and you get a really pure lithium carbonate. People have also discovered you can do that and instead of taking it to the bicarbonate process you take that slurry coming out, mix it with lime, then do the filtration, you get rid of the vast majority of your impurities, and then you take it to the lithium hydroxide finished product‚Ä¶people have done that and *in a single step of crystallization* they get battery grade lithium hydroxide. It‚Äôs extremely elegant, extremely clean and can be very much less environmentally impactful process.‚Äù\n\nJoe then cuts him off and doesn‚Äôt want to talk about non-commercial scale stuff at the time. Dave Buckley doesn‚Äôt say Outotec by name but references [Keliber](https://www.keliber.fi/site/assets/files/1889/executive_summary_of_the_updated_definitive_feasibility_study_id_17398.pdf) and [Critical Elements](https://www.cecorp.ca/en/critical-elements-successfully-produces-battery-grade-lithium-hydroxide-in-pilot-plant-testing/)‚Äô feasibility studies.\n\nOutotec seems to be the only company that is offering a complete LiOH pressure leaching commercial plant (rotary kilns, autoclaves, mixing vats/reactors), and the first one to be installed at scale will probably be for Tesla in Texas. Critical Elements and Keliber are planning to use the Outotec process but they‚Äôre still awaiting permits and full funding. PLL publicly said they plan to use conventional sulfuric acid approach back in 2020 before the Tesla offtake deal ([based on their 2020 Prefeasibility Study](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_729b9b64c6d99b2ef45579839f383203/piedmontlithium/db/336/2595/pdf/2067658.pdf)) but judging by Evercore analysts who met with PLL management a few weeks ago, PLL is at least considering a switch to the Outotec process through their relationship with Tesla and their joint Outotec test work.\n\nThe lithium hydroxide industry is still small (again \\~80,000 tonnes per year in 2020) compared to 2030 projections (1.5m-2m tonnes per year) and so existing technology (i.e. sulfuric acid roast) may not be what companies build going into the decade. Others could follow in Tesla‚Äôs footsteps and eventually Outotec‚Äôs process could be THE industry standard going forward, dominating the market in many areas: spodumene hard rock as preferred LiOH feedstock, pressure leaching flowsheet, Outotec autoclaves and kilns for conversion equipment. There‚Äôs potential for a big engineering shift and investing opportunity in companies involved in the Outotec process if Tesla (along with possibly PLL) is able to successfully disrupt the incumbents with this new lithium hydroxide flowsheet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**4. Sayona-Piedmont Deal Explained**\n\n[PLL invested $12M for a joint partnership with Sayona in Quebec Canada](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_9ad2aee07b47d44421d3191a6b666a51/piedmontlithium/db/336/2643/pdf/2163907.pdf) in January 2021. PLL now owns 19.9% in equity at the parent company level and 25% as a business partner at the asset level in Sayona Quebec, the subsidiary. Sayona plans to produce SC6 like PLL. Sayona could have 3 separate mining locations/projects all in the same general vicinity in Quebec.\n\nThe first is Authier (French ‚Äúo-thee-A‚Äù) their flagship mine: 14 year life, plans to produce 114,000 tonnes SC6 per year. For comparison, PLL is 25 year life, 160,000 tonnes per year SC6.\n\nAuthier is smaller than PLL‚Äôs announced ore body today in North Carolina but SYA can at least resupply PLL back what they‚Äôre selling to Tesla so PLL can at least keep their currently announced lithium hydroxide (LiOH) plant size of 22,700 tonnes per year instead of having to potentially downsize due to the Tesla deal that ships 1/3 of PLL SC6 to Austin, Texas.\n\nThis is the announced PLL offtake deal base case 60,000 tonnes per year *for the life of the Authier mine* in the announcement which is about 50% of Authier expected output.\n\nWhat gets interesting is the two additional Sayona mining projects: a bid for currently in bankrupt NAL (North American Lithium) and the not so explored Tansim Project.\n\nSayona is currently a bidder for NAL (North American Lithium). NAL mine is literally adjacent to Authier (60km/36 mi West) also in Quebec but NAL went bankrupt in 2019. NAL was producing SC6 which means they have a running mine plus a 180,000 tonne per year nameplate capacity spodumene concentrator already working but it turned out their mined ore was not as good as hoped and therefore needed a lot more sifting/filtering to get to a decent concentration which ultimately means higher costs. They were also shipping this exclusively to China which is expensive from Quebec. But mostly due to plummeting SC6 prices the past few years this basically crushed them into bankruptcy. Just poor timing since we‚Äôre at the beginning of what looks to be a raging bull market for lithium and EV battery metals in general.\n\nShould Sayona win the bid, they want to mix their good ore from Authier with NAL‚Äôs not-as-good-as-hoped-for ore and together the plant should run with lower operating expenses. If Sayona wins the bid, they‚Äôll get NAL mine, ore body, and essentially a brand new 180,000 tonne per year concentrator plant already built.\n\nAll NAL bids were due January 15 2021, which is probably why the $12 million investment from PLL was timely (the week of) to hopefully ensure Sayona wins. This was supposed to close last July 2020 but Covid delayed the sale. An announcement is expected any day now as of February 15.\n\nThe third Sayona mining project nearby Authier and NAL where Sayona has land rights and are exploring an area called Tansim and this alone could be the size of the current PLL in North Carolina at 25 million tonnes. Range estimate for Tansim is 5 to 25Mt at 1.2% ‚Äì 1.3% Li2O. This is in exploration phase.\n\nIf Tansim mine pans out, Sayona will probably need to expand or build another concentrator to increase throughput of SC6.\n\nSayona could go from 180,000 tonnes per year (from NAL) to +300,000 tonnes per year.\n\nAnd therefore, if all 3 mines pan out, PLL could have first dibs to get 50% of all Sayona output: Authier + NAL + Tansim.\n\nThis is a great deal for PLL and they‚Äôre starting to lay the foundation to show how they could be a lot bigger, as [PLL‚Äôs CEO Keith Phillips said in a recent interview with S&P Global](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/020221-expect-lithium-supply-crunch-by-2025-as-ev-market-booms-piedmont-ceo).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\***\n\n**5. Upcoming Near Term Expected News That Can Drive PLL Stock Higher**\n\nLastly, I‚Äôll conclude with some near term (next 6 months) expected news that should drive the stock.\n\n* Lithium Hydroxide Offtake Deal with major battery/cathode company like LG Chem or Tesla. Recently, Yahua in China signed a 5 year hydroxide offtake deal with Tesla. Their stock rocketed 60% in 5 days (Shanghai exchange caps most companies at +10% per day).\n* Launch Chemical Plant Definitive Feasibility Study and announcing a change to the Outotec Process like Tesla.\n* Mine and Concentrate Plant DFS Complete. This is their Critical Design Review equivalent for other engineers out there. They can take this and use it to make a real business case to get funding (next bullet).\n* Clarity around funding $500M+ in total capex for the integrated project: the mine and concentrator (in 2022) and chemical plant (by 2023). Could be combination of low interest loan (Dept of Energy and Biden Administration may be in play) and a big company who would want to become a business partner and own the assets. Could also issue shares but doubt PLL management will issue $600M in shares since they have stressed their focus is shareholder value.\n* Converting/increasing resource base from indicated/estimated in North Carolina after new drilling started last August 2020. Could announce an increase in throughput of SC6 production underpinning the ‚Äúbuilding a bigger business‚Äù theme like the Sayona offtake deal.\n* Mine and Concentrate Plant Construction Start in North Carolina\n\nThat's it for this post.

By comparison, its closest rival Canopy Growth Corporation had a revenue increase of **%76**.\n\nWhile revenue growth this year will be slightly subdued this year due to COVID supply issues and temporary closure of retail shops, pent-up demand (fuelled not only by a desire to make up for lost time, but also as a way for people to cope with the built-up anxiety of lockdown) and further mainstreaming of recreational cannabis products will only support growth long-term.\n\nIn November, Aphria purchased Sweetwater Brewing, one of the largest independent craft brewers in the US. This, along with the fact that TLRY has a contract with InBev, one of the largest beverage producers in the world, and the growing demand for more flexible ways to consume cannabis, opens up a completely new revenue stream. It‚Äôs price since that merger is up **311%**.\n\n**Politics**\n\nIn the US, Democrats now control all of Congress, Senate and the White House. Their more progressive stance on recreational drugs compared to the previous administration means decriminalisation at a federal level is a lot more likely. This is highlighted by Chuck Schumer‚Äôs announcement that a draft of the bill be introduced at some point H1 2021.\n\nFull US decriminalisation not only unlocks a massive market, but also places focus on European countries to follow suit with full de-restriction and regulation (this is already happening in some countries, with France currently undergoing a public consultation).\n\nWhen this happens, Aphria‚Äôs European operations and scale means they can go to market at scale quicker than most rivals.\n\n**Possible downsides**\n\nCannabis stocks are volatile stocks at the best of times, given the hype that has emerged on WallStreetBets surrounding this sector in the last few days, expect price to be volatile, with some more potential downside as the hype cools down.\n\nFurthermore, some analysts are skeptical of the true size of the recreational cannabis market, suggesting growth has plateaued, pointing to sub-par market performance compared to projections historically. Personally, I believe this is all short term, as the market becomes more embedded and accepted, we will see more ‚Äòcasual‚Äô users entering the market.\n\n**Summary**\n\nUnderneath all the volatility, APHA has some solid fundamentals that stand out compared to peers in the sector, that‚Äôs without taking into account the TLRY merger, which personally I believe will be a game changer.\n\nIn terms of investment play, this is a long-term hold, so if you are interested prepare to purchase and hold for 2‚Äì3 years. There is lots of volatility surrounding the stock, especially currently, I would suggest a small portfolio allocation, entering either before the merger, or before US decriminalisation if you miss that boat.\n\n# What‚Äôs next?\n\nIf people find this content useful, I plan on sharing this on a regular cadence, along with providing some of my commentary and DD on these stocks, so you can garner a better idea of what the stocks are about.\n\nPlease share this with friends who may find this type of content useful.

{"title": "T+2, and why Citadel is winning tomorrow", "selftext": "Looking through the prepared testimonies for tomorrow, you will notice that (for good reason), there is a paucity of discussion regarding the mechanisms behind the price action of GME, and (from Vlad‚Äôs testimony), a great deal of discussion regarding the mechanism of factors that contributed to trade halting.\n\nOne factor that keeps being brought up, both by RH and Citadel, is the logistics and capital requirements of delayed settlement.\n\nhttps://docs.house.gov/meetings/BA/BA00/20210218/111207/HHRG-117-BA00-Wstate-GriffinK-20210218.pdf\n\nEnter T+2. \n\nAs an uncertified crayon-eating degenerate, the concept of delayed settlement is something that I was vaguely aware of, but didn‚Äôt really care about, because as long as the tendies are on my dashboard, who cares what the Wendy‚Äôs kitchen looks like. And for the majority of the lowlifes here, it likely has minimal impact in the way you trade (unless your margin YOLO goes horribly, horribly wrong). But for the big boys, it‚Äôs a bit different.\n\nFor the children who are hopping in for the first time, imagine a scenario where a bunch of apes are trained to gamble in a casino with chips. Each game is played, chips are moved around second by second, but the apes don‚Äôt materially walk out with changes in cash money until you trade the chips for money. The casino is taking care and tracking these things for you, and you don‚Äôt think about it too hard because you walk away with what you‚Äôre supposed to. But the pit boss is always watching what‚Äôs going on, and moving the cash in the back to make sure things run smoothly. Historically, this delay (measured in days) helped the boomers and ancient folk settle the paperwork involved in trades, and has continually gotten shorter over time.\n\nT+2 is actually an acceleration of the settlement process. In 2017, the SEC finalized their move from T+3 to T+2 as standard for most market transactions. Yes, there‚Äôs variability, and some are already on a T+1 schedule, but for the most part that‚Äôs where we stand.\n\nSo why does it matter? Why does Citadel, and their hand up Vlad‚Äôs puppet ass, focus in on that as the intervention that the likely paid off investigatory committee should focus on? While I don‚Äôt have the internal data to support it, in theory, and even as stated previously by the SEC‚Äôs own press release, having acceleration of the process to keep up with technological advances has a number of benefits.\n\n https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2017-68-0\n\nAgain, why does this matter? To you and me, I doubt you notice it much. To the big boys, it means a lot. At that macro level, liquidity gives you volume, and volume gives you profits. By reducing the barriers to settling trades, they can minimize risk to margin, improving liquidity, and thereby allowing them to perform more trades per unit time.\n\nIn the grand scheme, if this goes as planned, Citadel and other MM‚Äôs will likely come out ahead in this case. The few billion they had to pay is likely a reasonable price for having a push to T+1, where they can theoretically continue to accelerate their capital growth on the scale of tens of billions of dollars over the coming years. Melvin‚Äôs got their panties in knots, and rightfully so, for getting completely fucked, but Citadel may yet come out on top from all this.\n\nTl;dr I think Citadel will try to convince the panel to make moves towards a T+1 standard. It‚Äôll speed up their transaction process, and print them more and more money. It‚Äôll sidestep any actual regulation to help retail, but also avoids looking overtly like they‚Äôre bullying us\n\nPositions: I dunno, stonks only go up\n\nEDIT 1 (11:45 PST): And here it is from Loudermilk. It‚Äôs a clear set-up: blame the market freeze on the collateral/margin regulation, Vlad agrees, then Kenneth lines it up to say how T+1 helps ‚Äúeverybody‚Äù (but some everybodies more than others).\n\nEDIT 2 (13:20 PST): Pretty consistent trend amongst the Republican representatives to blame settlement regulations to cause the trading halt. I honestly wasn‚Äôt expecting this much ‚Äúspontaneous‚Äù grandstanding from the questioners, but I suppose they‚Äôve been preparing for this for some time now.", "id": "lmic3q", "created_utc": 1613638623.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Instant settlement like digital currency would be nice.", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "...nab?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "A good post.

Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Thursday, February 18, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-18-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Dow set to drop as Walmart declines on disappointing earnings\n\n> * U.S. stock futures fell Thursday, after Dow stock Walmart dropped 4.5% in the premarket on disappointing earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday erased a 180-point loss and ended 90 points higher for another record close. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed slightly lower for the second straight session. The S&P 500 pared losses after minutes from the Fed‚Äôs last meeting signaled easy monetary policy for longer with the economy nowhere close to pre-coronavirus levels.\n\n> * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly jobless claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell. Economists expect 773,000 new filings for unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 20,000 from 793,000 initial claims the prior week, which saw little relief from declining Covid cases.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. Walmart missed on earnings, beat on revenue; CEO to boost wages\n\n> * Trying to turn pandemic gains into sustained momentum and higher profitability, Walmart on Thursday before-the-bell reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.39 per share, which fell short of estimates. Revenue grew by 7.3% to a better-than-expected $152.1 billion. The big-box retailer‚Äôs e-commerce sales in the U.S. grew by 69% and its same-store sales in the U.S. grew by 8.6%. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company will boost the wage of U.S. workers, raising the average for hourly employees to above $15 per hour.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. What to expect from GameStop hearing with Robinhood, Citadel, Reddit CEOs\n\n> * The heads of Robinhood, Reddit, Citadel and Melvin Capital, will be in Washington for Thursday‚Äôs highly anticipated GameStop hearing, which is scheduled to begin at noon ET in the House Financial Services Committee. According to prepared remarks, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman will testify that no significant activity on WallStreetBets last month was driven by bots or foreign agents. Keith Gill, the Reddit and YouTube trading star known as ‚ÄúRoaring Kitty,‚Äù will defend his social media posts that helped spark a mania in GameStop shares.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. How Texas power grid failed and what could stop it from happening again\n\n> * More than 500,000 households in Texas are still without power Thursday morning, according to poweroutage.us, following Sunday night‚Äôs historic cold and snow that caused the state‚Äôs worst blackouts in decades. Millions of people were in the dark at the height of the crisis, which was caused by a confluence of factors. Officials are already calling for investigations. Experts said there are a number of steps that Texas can take to combat future problems, including weatherizing equipment and increasing the amount of excess supply needed to meet peak power demand.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. U.S. life expectancy drops a year in pandemic, most since WWII\n\n> * Life expectancy in the U.S. dropped a staggering one year during the first half of 2020 as the pandemic caused the first wave of coronavirus deaths. Minorities suffered the biggest impact, with Black Americans losing nearly three years and Hispanics, nearly two years, according to preliminary estimates Thursday from the CDC. ‚ÄúYou have to go back to World War II, the 1940s, to find a decline like this,‚Äù said Robert Anderson, who oversees the numbers for the CDC. It‚Äôs already known that 2020 was the deadliest year in U.S. history, with deaths topping 3 million for the first time.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/FrLUO2J.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8MNKhv6.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/T3cRcfQL/econcal1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/15wRfpqK/econcal2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wWv2RIG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/968QLzv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/TP8PttvF/eram0111.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eg2VEbG.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/DfgMUm2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/AlgBlru.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ozc7nge.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/sfSCc3gj/upgradesdowngrades1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/VvjyLWVr/upgradesdowngrades2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/FKuhY48.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/OLqGg4c.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sQzqUDu.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/sWm5TFN.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-walmart-hormel-foods-marriott-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Walmart (WMT)** ‚Äì Walmart reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.39 per share, which includes a 7-cent impact from UK tax repayment.
