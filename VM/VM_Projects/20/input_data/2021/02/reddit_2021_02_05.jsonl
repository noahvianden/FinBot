Thought I’d share here as I believe it shows a great buying opportunity for AMD especially in the next coming weeks. While I know small street bets follows more penny stocks, I just think this is too good of an opportunity.\n\n# Fundamentals:\n\nTheir latest ER:\n\n**Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%**\n\n**Full year sales of $9.76 billion**\n\nServer revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible because that means they are actually going toe to toe with the big boys like IBM.\n\nMassive increase in guidance. They’re **expecting 37% growth** this year.\n\nSo why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let’s be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.\n\nObviously, we’d prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you’re gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, “hey we have too many orders and we can’t keep up sorry, we’ll get it to you ASAP”\n\nImagine thinking this company isn’t going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.\n\nOur queen, Lisa Su, said “there will be added capacity” in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they’ll be good to go. I wouldn’t worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.\n\n**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**\n\nIntel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!\n\n**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.\n\n**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.\n\n# Technicals:\n\nFor those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.\n\nWe really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we’re basically there right now.\n\nIn addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49t9dzxqghf61.png?width=1988&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9a45e5768cdd5fad74cfa67b2544f46065135d47\n\nFor more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here.

May decrease orders to Intel and AMD. Makes AWS more attractive than other cloud providers as you can get more performance for less money. Some lock-in once you have committed until other providers come up with their ARM chips. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGraviton is an ARM-based processor designed by Amazon, that runs only on EC2. Even on EC2, they cannot just replace instances with Graviton, because they run x86 code. Unless they come up with something like Apple's Rosetta.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt work, we are transitioning some workloads to Graviton. But, at the bare minimum, they need new pipelines so we can deploy ARM-based containers. This is either trivial or very tough. For example, if it's C code (either the application itself, or a library used by it) that relies on some specific x86 behavior, specially if it is related to memory. This is unlikely for most people though – because of how widespread ARM hardware is due to mobile, an incredible amount of software has been ported to ARM already, which includes the vast majority of open-source libraries. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStill, all groups in the organization need to move, so that's non trivial even when the technical aspect is. And if you need to support both Graviton and non-Graviton, you need two pipelines. Trivial for a startup, hard on the enterprise sector. Adoption will be slow unless there's some catalyst.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMeanwhile, x86 servers are being shipped to anyone who's not on AWS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is, however, a threat to other cloud providers. Amazon has access to a highly performant and cheap processor that they control. It might not be as fast as top Intel or AMD offerings, but for anything that can horizontally scale, that is irrelevant. Just deploy more servers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot only it increases Amazon's margin, but customers also have monetary incentives to migrate. If your account is big enough for enterprise support, AWS will happily get engineers to work with you to help you migrate. It's a win-win.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAzure and GCP need to come up with their answer (Microsoft is reportedly working on theirs).

I copied and pasted the content below:\n\nThe company's name is NEXE Innovations (TSX-V: NEXE), and you may have never heard of it, just like most didn't hear about Starbucks' original branch in the city of Seattle, only learning about it after it spread and expanded across America and Europe. When Starbucks went public on June 26th, 1992, its shares were worth $0.34, split-adjusted. Today, the company's stock trades for over $103. I tell you this since what we're talking about is TAM, which stands for “Total Available Market.” Starbucks shares have appreciated by 30,000% in 30 years!\n\nThe reason we point this out is not that I'm comparing the two, but because we want to highlight that selling coffee, which is a globally-recognized product and part of the culture in every country that we've ever visited, can be lucrative.\n\nThere aren't many high-margin beverages that are consumed daily, or even a few times per day; coffee is a unique consumer product. Before Apple Inc. launched its disruptive iPod Nano, which allowed hundreds of millions of music listeners to hear their favorite artists through a state-of-the-art device, Sony's or Panasonic's portable Discman were these massive contraptions that would look and feel ridiculous today. Apple's innovation was a category killer, so to speak, which is a product that allows an established industry (music delivery) to leap to its next stage without taking away any of its benefits.\n\nNEXE Innovations (TSX-V: NEXE) has been developing its technology for five years as a private company. Through the use of patents, intellectual property around their technology, automation, and 3D printing capabilities, they've been able to scientifically tackle one of the most important challenges of the modern world.\n\nThe NEXE coffee pods are fully-compostable and plant-based with no adhesives and the process of producing them is fully automated.\n\nIf you truly understand the value behind being able to begin mass-selling what could be the only fully-compostable coffee pod on planet Earth, as far as management is aware, the scope of this becomes instantly apparent. Five years and $35M have been spent to this point!\n\nThe trend towards making sure plastic products don't make it into our oceans is not only one that is fought by environmental movements on the fringes of society, but it's big business and carries with it significant financial benefits.\n\nAmerica is targeting ways to reduce carbon footprint drastically and invest in green industries. The implications for food and beverage producers will likely be profound because a pledge has been made to ensure that the U.S. agricultural sector achieves net-zero emissions. That’s just the beginning. Legislation could be enacted requiring polluters to bear the full cost of their climate pollution. This is deadly serious and the EPA and Justice Department might be ordered to pursue these cases to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nWe'll cover several additional angles of this company's competitive advantages, including patented technologies, regulatory environment, first-mover lead, and the number of scientific studies behind their POD; right now, we want to go over the financials and valuation.\n\nThe company owns a fully customized 10,000-square-foot facility in Canada.\n\nWebsite: https://nexeinnovations.com/nexe-launches-xoma-feb-5th-using-its-proprietary-capsule/\n\n\nI have 100 shares currently and holding long term.

{"title": "Fundamental Analysis on Why GME is Still a Buy", "selftext": "Hi There!\n\nI posted this on another sub but folks told me to post on others so more people understand the fundamental case for GME.  Long time lurker, first time poster on a new account. Thanks to WSB and [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/), I was able to go from $25k in April to just passing the $1MM mark ousing leads I found reddit along with my own DD.  Big plays were PTON >> NIO >> NVAX >> now GME. Proof (Up $900k of gains since Jan 1 2021, no idea how to go further back on TastyWorks, mods lmk if you need more proof):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4kuqjqdjrnf61.png?width=1038&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f69616b38be75a647af85ba362ad4c8cbab7e12\n\nI haven’t been seeing a lot of DD on GME fundamentals, so I figure it was my time to give back with some research on why I still think GME is a still value play not just momentum. Here's why I believe GME's current valuation is no more out of whack than the rest of the market, and why it still has so much more room to run.\n\n# GME’s E-commerce\n\nWhat if we stripped out all of GME’s brick and mortar business and just looked at it as an e-commerce business? Here are the stats vs. some comps:\n\n**GME:** $1.35B, 300% growth Q4 YoY\n\n**Chewy:** $6.5B (12mo ending 10/20), 45% growth Q3 YoY, Enterprise Value: $41.83, Enterprise Value to Revenue: 6.48\n\n**StitchFix:** $1.8B (12mo ending 10/20), 10% growth Q3 YoY, Enterprise Value: $9.8, Enterprise Value to Revenue: 5.57\n\nCrazy when you look at it this way. How much would an e-commerce company with $1.35B in revenue growing at 300% a year be worth with today’s valuations? If you used Chewy’s EV to Revenue of 6.5 for GME, you get a valuation of \\~$9B or a stock price of about $125. But wait a second, GME’s e-commerce grew almost 10x faster than Chewy’s and 30x faster than StitchFix this last quarter.\n\nFor a high watermark of a EV/Rev in e-commerce, we can see Poshmark with an EV/Rev of 24. They have a secondhand social marketplace for apparel, which is not a leap from GameStop’s game trade in model. Using that, GME should have an EV of $33B or a share price of \\~$475. And that is using a pre-Ryan Cohen e-comm revenue. Imagine how much it’ll rocket now that he’s on the board. Hedge funds will probably argue that GME got a one time boost from the launch of new consoles, but you can say the same thing about folks avoiding dressing rooms in retailers across the country.\n\n**Tl;dr: GME is worth somewhere between $125-$475 per share with their e-commerce biz alone at today’s valuations, and that was pre-Ryan Cohen**\n\n# GME’s Brick and Mortar\n\nIn that first part, I highlighted why GME is worth it on e-commerce alone, brick and mortar is where I am really excited. Hedge funds will tell you it has been a drain on earnings, and that all transactions are becoming digital. To date that has been true, with GME reporting terrible numbers since the start of the pandemic. But what if GME took the consumer obsessed mindset that had in Chewy, applied it to a bigger Total Addressable Market (TAM) in gaming, and they had physical storefronts as assets? The possibilities are endless if GME pushes the limits of innovation.\n\nA couple of examples:\n\n1. Back when Best Buy began their turn around, they started monetizing their store footprint for their store-in-a-stores. Most of the electronics manufacturers like Samsung needed a showroom but didn’t want to build the infrastructure to compete with the Apple stores. They realized having a neutral showroom was critical to competing and were willing to pay rent. The revenue sharing agreement with Microsoft looks like a step in this direction, as Microsoft closed their storefronts earlier this year.\n\n[Best Buy bets big on store-within-store concepts - StarTribune.com](https://www.startribune.com/best-buy-bets-big-on-store-within-store-concepts/215301161/)\n\n[GameStop will reportedly get a cut of Xbox games, even if you’re not buying them from GameStop - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517970/gamestop-revenue-sharing-microsoft-xbox-digital-downloads-games#:~:text=The%20new%20revenue%20sharing%20deal,Gold%20and%20Xbox%20Game%20Pass).)\n\n2) Imagine if GME competed with the likes of Twitch, but their asset was physical locations. Think mini e-sports arenas. Where retail was a side benefit instead of the end-all-be all. Many tabletop gaming stores having this as a model. It could be a reimagination of 80s arcades\n\n[GameStop Stepping Up to the Plate in Esports | The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/04/14/gamestop-stepping-up-to-the-plate-in-esports.aspx)\n\n3) Build a PC Kiosks that are coming. I believe no matter how much things go digital, there is going to be a need for hardware and peripherals at least for the forseeable future.\n\n[$GME DD- Build-a-PC Kiosks Coming : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kypuyb/gme_dd_buildapc_kiosks_coming/)\n\nThis could be a situation where 1+1 = 3. Where a robust, growing e-commerce platform could complement an amazing in-person experience – and one that others can’t replicate. So while the current valuation is supported by the e-commerce business alone, the in-store opportunities could make this an amazing buy. Plus, they are closing unproductive stores, their debt levels aren’t crazy, and are close to being free cash flow positive despite the lock down. I'd argue the GameStop brand recognition alone is worth $1B of goodwill\n\n**Tl;dr GME B&M is a drag on the books, but there is huge opportunity.**\n\n# How did hedge funds miss this?\n\nIn order for hedge funds to get their massive returns, they gross up meaning they take an equal amount of long and short bets to stay neutral to the market while taking crazy amounts of leverage. Their macro bet was simple, long e-commerce short brick and mortar. And that was right to an extent. GME was a perfect target bc of software transactions going digital. But I think they missed one big thing: the risk is asymmetric now bc of the Fed’s printers going brrrrrrrrrrrrrr. They bet on a bunch of companies going bankrupt but many aren’t because of the easy access to cheap liquidity. So the short side can’t go down anymore, which means their risk is way out of whack and they overly suppressed valuations on the short side.\n\nI think also GME is also a special case, where Wall Street used traditional B&M retailer valuations when there is so much more opportunity here. $1B of e-commerce growing at 300% is **OUT OF THIS WORLD**. For the next 10 years, I don't see game hardware and peripherals going away which is still a huge TAM. I don't think any other meme stock has this story. Ryan Cohen saw it, we see, but the talking heads on CNBC don’t seem to as of yet. This valuation is still great, and no where near what we are seeing with all the IPOs out there. Like how does Palantir have a $60B valuation with $700M of revenue growing at 50%? GME's e-comm business beats in revenue and growth. It really just goes against the Hedge Fund/media narrative of value and their traditional DCFs. I could see this rubber banding back up on pure value once they are back to a positive EPS, and beyond once the e-commerce really takes off. I may need to hold for a year, but I see strong growth ahead regardless\n\n**Position:** 1000 shares of long stock, OTM naked short puts for premium and potential average down\n\n**Tl;dr: If Wallstreet is okay with Tech Valuations GME is still a buy not for the squeeze, but as a mid to long term growth play (as in may need to hold for a year).

{"title": "Let's talk about video games", "selftext": "Hi all, \n\nI'm new to investing and I've been trying to do my research. I am not very good at DD (a lot of the financial data goes over my head) but I'm trying to look at it from a logical point of view. A good tip for investing is to invest in an industry you know. I work in electric vehicles and plan to invest heavily there, but probably the next industry I am most knowledgeable about is video games.... Anyways, here's my opinion, any feedback would be much appreciated. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Prospect for Growth**\n\nFirst off I think that video games as an industry has a very bright future. Video games are the [most profitable form of entertainment](https://gamecrate.com/statistically-video-games-are-now-most-popular-and-profitable-form-entertainment/20087) right now and can only grow in the future. In the last two decades game studios managed to shift the target demographic from kids to adults, with males age [18-34 playing the most games.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/189582/age-of-us-video-game-players-since-2010/) Video games aren't for kids anymore and the target demographic is expected to age further meaning that gamers have good access to disposable income. \n\nVideo games are becoming more mainstream and also have technology on their side and become bigger and better year after year. It's impossible to say where the medium will be in 20 years, but considering the difference in the industry between now and the year 2000 then the sky is the limit. \n\nOverall if you want to diversify and invest in some form of entertainment then video games is the way to go. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Consoles**\n\nI believe that Sony will dominate the next generation of consoles simply because of their exclusive games on offer.  They have had good growth in the last 5 years and I believe this will continue in the next 10 years. They currently cannot keep up with demand for their latest console [but once production ramps up I think they will make significant gains.](https://www.techspot.com/news/88121-insiders-claim-sony-accelerate-ps5-production-2021-meet.html) \n\nI also see Nintendo doing well. They are carving a good niche in the handheld market and have no real competitors. They also tend to target a younger demographic so don't compete so much with Sony or Microsoft for the adult market. [They are planning to start selling a more powerful verison of their switch console soon.](https://www.tomsguide.com/round-up/nintendo-switch-pro-release-date-specs-leaks-and-more)\n\nI expect Microsoft to underperform in the next generation, though I would consider them to be a safe bet overall because of their other business. They may also do very well from their [acquisition of Zenimax (which owns Bethesda)](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/09/21/microsoft-to-acquire-zenimax-media-and-its-game-publisher-bethesda-softworks/) and may see significant gains once their plans to use that are revealed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Game Studios**\n\nThere are a number of game studios worth considering such as Activision, Ubiosoft, Electronic Arts, etc.\n\nHowever, I would be hesitant to invest in these as I consider game studios to be VERY high profile. I don't think any other industry has as much scrutiny from its customer base. No one knows when one will engulfed in a controversy and have it's stock price suffer. \n\nBut I think I will invest in Take Two interactive, which owns the huge developer Rockstar.  A Red Dead Redemption 3 or Grand Theft Auto 6 would likely be game of the generation and their [online business model make an obscene amount of money](https://www.tweaktown.com/news/69666/gta-made-half-billion-dollars-2019-3-best-earning-game/index.html#:~:text=GTA%20Online%20managed%20to%20make,Year%20in%20Review%20sales%20brief).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Hardware**\n\nOf course there is also PC gaming to consider. No console to invest in here but Nvidia and AMD are solid stocks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FINAL VERDICT:**\n\nOverall I think my investment in gaming will look like this, with the intention of holding for the next 10 years. \n\nSony +++\n\nNintendo ++\n\nTake Two ++\n\nMicrosoft + \n\nNvidia +\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, what does anyone think?

{"title": "Let's have rational approach on GME", "selftext": "First, i'm still in 455 shares. Sold some calls during pumps so I already locked in $25k in gains.\n\nSo, let's address this. The \"Squeeze\" we've been having IMO is not a short squeeze but a mix of a FOMO rally and *some* shorts covering and shorts opened at the top. We can't deny that. It's not comparable to the dot com bubble because many of those companies really didn't have any value and was purely on speculation. GME's point is to rally so hard to margin call the shorts but RH capped us and screwed us over. Is there still hope? Who knows.\n\nNext, GME has to be a profitable company or show good signs of a turnaround for shorts to realize they've had enough gains/losses and should start exiting in an attempt maybe to short at higher PT. Read the actual DD—it has always been a value play.\n\nFrom Chewy wiki:\n\n*Chewy was founded under the name \"Mr. Chewy\" in June 2011 by* [*Ryan Cohen*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Cohen) *and Michael Da.The company hired former employees and executives from* [*Amazon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com)*,* [*PetSmart*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PetSmart)*,* [*Whole Foods Market*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_Foods_Market)*, and* [*Wayfair*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayfair)*. In March 2012, the company estimated a total yearly revenue of $26 million, despite losing money in its first half year.From 2014 to 2015, sales grew from $205 million to $423 million.*\n\nIt's not exactly bananas to bananas but you see a pattern here? Ryan hiring people with experience then building with his team to make a company better? The reason GameStop has been on a decline has **always** been because of bad decisions at the executive levels. If you've ever had the pleasure of working under people with actually good management skills, you'd know they'd mostly succeed wherever they go. You can move, change your job, or enter a different circle of people but you'll **always** bring yourself. A person who can successfully turn around a company after getting rid of the old problems? Bullish.\n\nI'm not telling you to buy or sell, i'm not a financial adviser but jezuz, ya'll acting like everything about this company depends in 24 hours or a week. It will depend on **GameStop** to drive another rally whether with a squeeze or not. Give more attention to the earnings and GameStop's road map rather than SI %. If not a short squeeze play, consider it a boring long investment, your 401ks probably have gone up and down throughout the years but you didn't shit yourself each time right? Relax and let go of the price action.\n\nYou will be tempted to sell at lows, you will be tempted to sell highs just to \"break even\". It's your choice whether you can stomach loss, potential gains, or opportunity costs harder, but please, consider the actual company instead of just the price. I got in because I believed the price was just bad sentiment and artificially driven down by over shorting.\n\nLastly, unless you're not meeting bills, financial obligations, or paying your monthly dues for the backdoor brojob Wendy's, relax. Nothing has changed, the outside world hasn't changed, the ground that you're stepping on hasn't changed, only your perception has changed. Stop day dreaming about massive gains or dreading about massive losses. Have a more stoic approach and a plan.\n\nThat being said, I'm glad to have held and cried with you all. Even if it was for just a moment I actually saw a solidarity that didn't care about politics, race, or gender—only tendies and each other. You lose, you gain, that's life but life is not only about gains and losses.\n\nTL;DR: Look at other things aside from price action. It's been quite a ride, it's an honor to have been in it. Don't worry so much, your wife's BF will take care of her while you do other things.

{"title": "A Sobering Reflection On The GME Saga", "selftext": "A Sobering Reflection As The GME Saga Settles\n\nWith last week’s craze of GME is starting to settle, I wanted to write down some of my thoughts and learnings as someone relatively new to this. I initially intended for this to be a way for myself to reflect, but at the end of writing I thought why not share it if it means it could help someone in a similar situation. This post may be quite long so get comfortable, but first, a little background…\n\nI’d like to think of myself as your average newbie investor, a recent newcomer to the game with no previous experience of investing since it was never taught to us at school. Being 24 years old with a steady job I manage my day to day finances closely ensuring a good amount of disposable income that I can use as I see fit with a good chunk of it split to ensure a comfortable future. Over the past couple of years I’ve racked up a decent amount of savings and even had a savings pot for some “on the whim” purchases, but amongst lockdowns and towards the end of last year my need for spending was at it’s lowest, which is exactly the point where I was targeted with advertising for all sorts of investing apps that made it out how easy it is to make my money work for me.\n\nSo I thought, why don’t I make my money work for me?\n\nI was cautious setting off at first, only putting in a small chunk of my “on the whim” savings to buy some stocks in companies that I was familiar with; British Petroleum, Royal Dutch Shell, and a Vanguard S&P500 ETF. While they might not have been the most optimal picks, they were ones that I was at ease with knowing that my money would be relatively safe with potential to rebound from the lows of the pandemic. I committed to putting in a set amount each month into my investment account and slowly growing my portfolio.\n\nI did want to educate myself more though, was I doing the right thing? Were these stocks ones that were going to make my money work for me?\n\nOf course, I hit up Reddit and quickly found subs like r/Stocks, r/Investing and r/UKPersonalFinance. This is the point where I was truly overwhelmed with information and how to set up my investment portfolio to suit my goals. It was welcoming to see how many people there were willing to help, but it seemed like for every suggestion made there was a contradiction to it, after all I wanted to have the best portfolio that would guarantee me a millionaires retirement… A feat I quickly found out was not as easy as some made it out to be.\n\nFrom that point on I was glued to my trading app and Reddit, my screen on time during the day went from a couple of hours to a distressing 10 hours at its peaks. I was changing my portfolio every couple of days and I will admit that I was addicted to seeing green across all my stocks. The moment a stock started dipping into the red I would sell it and look for the next “Hot” opportunity, sometimes changing stocks multiple times in one day. I was day trading without knowing what that even was yet.\n\nThis is where r/WallStreetBets comes into play, a sub that I stumbled across when it spilled over into conversations on the other investing forums, it so happened that I joined just at the time when Palantir was getting all the hype and was still under $20. So many people liked this stock and after reading some of the posted DD I thought to myself, hey this seems like a good thing to put into my portfolio and balance it out with a high risk high reward investment. So I bought a few shares at around $18 and after only a couple of days I saw it grow rapidly like I haven’t seen from any of my stocks before, I was hooked! Before I knew it my “on the whim” savings pot read $0, and I tripped down on my stocks in Palantir. After all, the stock was going to $300 right?\n\nFor the next couple of days I felt like I was the next warren buffet, my first 50% gain in only a few days was an exhilarating feeling… Which was quickly followed by a week of the stock going downwards. This was the side of investing that I had not experienced yet, I saw my gains vanishing every day but was reassured by the fact most considered this a healthy pullback. I thought to myself, what if this is the start of the bursting bubble everyone is talking about? So I sold my positions right at the $22 dollar mark which was exactly the point it started to make a recovery. I can’t lie, I was pretty annoyed with myself but nonetheless I took my profits and promised myself to do better next time.\n\nThe next few weeks throughout December I took time to research companies, do my due diligence, and invest in businesses I would be comfortable holding when those red days come. So I assembled my first portfolio which I was genuinely proud of consisting of; Etsy, Pintrest, Curiosity Stream, Romeo Power, Arrival and Apple - collectively these stocks took a 75% share of my portfolio with none taking more than a 15% stake on their own - I split the remaining 25% into two ETF’s; ICLN, and VWRL. \n\nThis is the point where I left my portfolio as it was for the longest period without any day trading - I repurposed the time I used to use staring at my trading app into reading “The Intelligent Investor” which made apparent to me the mistakes that I made in the past with entering and exiting positions. I got about half way through the book when I started to notice the Gamestop trend coming along with people saying that this is the next hot thing…\n\nSure I believed that there was money to be made, but after getting burned with Palantir I was cautious of investing into a very high risk but high reward stock until I was much more knowledgeable. Besides, the money pot of expendable savings has run dry so I couldn’t fund my journey to the moon anyway. That was until I got tipsy one night and saw that the stock had gone up 200%, I thought to myself, why don’t I take a chunk of my house savings and put them into the stock? If it was to go up, say, another 200% we could be in such a better position to buy our first house soon and we would even have some money spare to treat ourselves to something nice! \n\nI woke up the next morning, realising how stupid that idea would have been and dismissed the thought as I watched the stock climb to almost $500 a share over the next couple of days - that could have been my house deposit I thought to myself again. Then came the first pitfall of a dip and I thought to myself that it was for the best that I gave it a miss, could I have trusted myself to get out anywhere near the top? Or would I have crashed out again right at the bottom. Similarly to Palantir, I did not see the hype dying down at all - is this a pullback just like what happened when I crashed out of my first risky investment? Surely the stock will go to $5000 next right?\n\nI drew up on my house savings and decided to put a chunk into Gamestop on the way up from the $190 dip, ultimately, I could put that money straight back after I make my gains so what’s the worst that could happen, I thought to myself. I got in at around $300 and felt amazingly confident at close with the stock rising to $330, onwards and upwards from here boys! \n\nI was again glued to my trading app, researching the short % and the pre/after market price fluctuations. Monday was where it started to go wrong but I was feeling confident that it was another dip and it was time to load up before take off. Fuck it, let's sell my ETF’s, who wants a “boomer” portfolio anyway, so off they went and straight into Gamestop. Tuesday took me by surprise but “look at the way the VW short squeeze happened” - god I wish I could have told myself to shut up here, but no, that was my mentality and I went ahead and sold some of my core positions to further average down into GME.\n\nWednesday was just a game of watching my investment tumble off of a cliff, and today came the sobering thoughts after realising what I gave into, which stood against everything that I built up since beginning my journey with investing. This has lead me to spill my words out here, with my Gamestop shares at $247 average. I take this as quite an expensive lesson, but I am very thankful that it is one that will only set me back some months on my savings, and not completely ruin me financially for the foreseeable future. \n\nMy plan? Well I either take my losses here which I really see no point in being -80% down on my investment. So I plan to go back to my original method; leave the shares as they are for now, do some due diligence of my own on Gamestop, see what the company has planned for in the future and if it is worth averaging down in for a very long term investment. Remind me in 5 years I guess?\n\nThe hardest part of coming to terms with what has happened was definitely the amount of people labelling others in a similar situation as being holders, and the constant mocking of GME shareholders from some people on this sub. I certainly don’t like to take things personally but it did get to that point, I wanted to prove everybody wrong and in believing that the stock would skyrocket I was only lying to myself. So the next time you see someone in a similar state to where I was blindly chasing a dream, offer them some words of advice, don’t shit on their dreams just because they can’t see a way out at the moment. Some people have gambled away much more than I have here but that is no reason for them or their intelligence to be made fun of, we’re all here for the same reason and we should all have each others backs both when it comes to gains or losses.\n\nHopefully I was able to put across how quickly things can fall apart just because of our desire to improve our current lifestyle as quickly as possible and I don’t think that any one can be blamed for wanting to do this when GME was so widely hyped.

Please poke holes in this and berate me so I can be reminded not to speak out of turn.\n\nTo keep a long story short, everyone's waiting on FINRA to update short interest data on Feb 9th. I don't know if that's the only source for that data, but someone noticed [here]( https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ShortPercentageOfFloat/gme/Short-Percentage-Of-Float) that it showed 292% short percentage of float. This is a higher percentage than FINRA's most recent update in January. That doesn't necessarily mean it's newer information, but it's likely, isn't it? There's also meta-data on the page suggesting it's up to date as of Feb 5th.\n\nWhat I THINK this means is they didn't cover their shorts--rather, they had to short again to drive the price down, increasing their short interest. They successfully drove it down and probably convinced lots of people to sell. That number could be a few days old too, so my best guess is that either they have already been slowly covering shorts but not to a degree that it would drive the price up, or they're still driving the price to rock bottom so that it will encourage even more selling and will allow them to recover their position more easily.

Some companies that have been rumored have been Stripe (plz god), ***Bloomberg***, Fidelity, Chick-fil-a, Subway (lmao), WeWork, SpaceX (no lol), WaWa, and many many more. Make no mistake, you are investing in Bill Ackman’s ability to find a mature unicorn and once the announcement is made, that is the company that you are invested in. Keep in my mind, when acquisition is announced that company will get a 5 billion injection of cash, so going forward it makes for a healthy company.\n\nSo who the fuck is Bill Ackman?\n\nYou may hate the guy or love him, but you can’t deny that this dude is sharp as a fucking tack and knows his shit. He also gets to fuck on **Neri Oxmen**, *so that’s tight*. I’d say his notoriety comes from a few different events so let’s do a quick recap.\n\n1. Calling the 2020 crash: You can say his doom and gloom prediction before the Covid crash was an orchestrated event, but either way he was fucking right and that matters. Obviously, I don’t need to tell you what has happened since then, I haven’t been to a bar in like a fucking year. ***But this was one if the biggest trades in history turning 27 million in 2.6 billion by using credit protection on investment grade and high yield bond indexes.***\n2. The Herbalife short: You can watch “Betting on Zero” if you don’t know about this, but he shorted Herbalife and exposed them for their ***predatory practices and MLM scheme***. Here he was “right” but still lost the trade (so wrong). Had he never announced his position in this, he may have **hit a lick here**, but you must foresee adaptation and adjustment, so he took an L. Did Icahn fuck him here? Yeah, but you have to admire the research and the balls he had for this call.\n3. Valeant airball: a huge shitshow in which Valeant was boosting drug prices and doing shady stuff. He lost 4 billion on this. Obviously not a great look and *he has to eat the full L here*.\n\nA mixed bag when it comes to his reputation, but I believe he does his research well and that combined with his business acumen is why I have a heavy (personally) position in PSTH.\n\nSo how will this play out?\n\nI’m not gunna go over every rumor in depth, but I’ll cover some that I like and some that I don’t.\n\nStripe: This is the one that every PSTH investor is up late *at night touching themselves to*. If it’s stripe this will explode and could easily hit **100** within the year (maybe even day). I personally don’t think it will be Stripe, in an interview about 6 months ago he said they weren’t ready to go public. Maybe by the time he announces they will be? Some people are saying that there is no chance of a Fintech merger, he hasn’t said anything that would make me believe that. Does he have experience in that industry? No, **but that doesn’t disqualify it.**\n\nBloomberg: **My personal prediction** and my 3rd choice if I had to pick one of the rumored companies. Ackman likes to dip his toes into political commentary and philanthropy, both of which Michael Bloomberg also does. I just think this is a good fit all around, he said he loves Bloomberg and has had an active subscription since the 90’s.\n\nSpaceX: This is pure speculation; this would go absolutely parabolic. I don’t even know the heights that this stock could reach if this was to happen.\n\nFidelity: I’m not sure where some of these rumors originate from, but I think it’s because they are eyeing an IPO soon. I personally use Fidelity so I like this, it’s app could use an injection of youth and 5 billion could *definitely do it.* Pair this with the recent influx of people who are going to be leaving platforms like RH and other apps using the APEX clearing house and you have yourself a ***possible homerun***.\n\nChik-fil-a: The lords chicken. Any food chain mentioned is a possibility due to Ackman’s background in food chains. CF is a good company, but there is a lot of hype surrounding this SPAC, I’m not sure this would be a catalyst for a big move.\n\nSubway: People laugh at this one, but it is the ***largest food chain in the U.S.*** That makes this play a little better but *still kind of disappointing* IMO.\n\nWaWa: I don’t know enough about this company, I know it has a near cult like following so that’s a positive, but again, the biggest SPAC ever ends up being a WaWa? wack.\n\nPornHub and Onlyfans: LMAAOO. No fucking way, but would it make money? **Instant meme stock makes for a massive pump.**\n\nWework: I don’t know enough about this company to have a strong opinion, but I’ve heard positive rumblings about it. This would be wildcard, I’m not sure how the market would react.\n\nSo how to play this? I don’t fucking know I’m not a financial advisor. I’m looking for Billy SPACman to take me to tendie town. Personally, I think he will make a great choice, so I’ve been building a LEAPs position for months now. I also own shares, for the warrants. It’s also crazy that we haven’t heard a **single reputable rumor and it has been MONTHS** now since the SPAC was announced.\n\nTLDR; Let Billy SPACman take you to the moon on his STRIPed Spacex rocket ship from your Fidelity app. Lots of rumors here, you’re investing in the individual.\n\nEdit for 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nAlso if it isn't SpaceX, Bloomberg, Fidelity, maybe Wework, i'm not sure I'd hold long term.", "id": "lde08y", "created_utc": 1612550540.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "Stripe or bust for psth \n\nBft however, straight to the moon,🚀", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Spackman I'm tired of eating theta on my calls.

{"title": "Containership Rate Boom Continues: ATCO & CMRE", "selftext": "**Atlas Corp (ATCO) & Costamare (CMRE) & Peers**\n\nI shared my views on containership stocks earlier this week with a [note on these stocks here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l9unrf/containership_boom_ongoing/), but news is quickly improving even further, so it merits yet another update. Since last Friday, the top 3 picks in the container sector have moved up by a range of 24% to 32% (Danaos Corp, Navios Maritime Partners, Navios Containers). I listed the three largest cap names in the title since those are all over $1B and apparently anything under $1B = pump and dump. But AMC apparently wasn't?! Okay guys...\n\nAs I noted last week, rates for containerships (the ships which carry thousands of the 20-40’ boxes you see on railroads and trucks) have been going ballistic the past 4-5 months, but some of the stocks have stalled out and still trade at remarkably cheap valuations. For instance Navios Containers trades in the neighborhood of 2x my expectations for their 2021 earnings.\n\nLink to the latest containership rates: [https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do](https://harpex.harperpetersen.com/harpexVP.do)\n\nThe latest Harpex rates are posted each Friday morning. The new update that came out about 2 hours ago has them up another 13.2% for the midsize Panamax segment. This is a daily rate of $30,000 for the ships that hold 4,250 TEU (i.e. the ship can carry 4,250 20-foot boxes or a little more than 2,000 40-foot boxes). Remember the trains? Those are usually 40' on top of another 40' per each car.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I'm currently long about every name possible in the sector. The names remain cheap. However, obviously if stocks keep surging, I will take profits in a responsible manner on the way up. \"Dia hands\" is a funny/cute meme, but it's really quite dumb for investors. Do your own due diligence, figure out what you believe something is worth, and don't get greedy!\n\nThe 13%+ increase in mid-sized container rates exemplifies the strength for a firm like Navios Containers (which owns 25 of these 'Panamax' ships!), but we should also look at Danaos Corp, which just announced a [comprehensive refinancing](https://www.danaos.com/news-and-media/press-release-details/2021/Danaos-Corporation-Announces-Pricing-of-Senior-Notes-Offering/default.aspx) for the whole company.\n\nThis is a massive turnaround from a company, which was on the verge of bankruptcy just a year ago. After the refinancing Danaos has a very streamlined balance sheet with no major maturities until 2028. Don't just take my view of it! Randy Giveans, analyst at Jefferies, and someone I can personally vouch for as a competent analyst with strong integrity, ***just upgraded them to $40.00/sh***. I think he might even be too conservative on them...\n\nI believe we're potentially just in the 4th or 5th inning of this run.\n\n**Bottom Line:** Bullish on containership names, really the entire sector. Sticking to names with market caps over $1B for the rules here- Atlas Corp (ATCO) and Costamare (CMRE).\n\n**Common Pushback:**\n\n1. Aren't these rates just in a massive bubble and will crash soon:\n\nThe rates appear to be quite strong compared to the past 10 years, but if you look at a 20-year average and the strength of the 2000s, you'll see they aren't that far out of line. The past decade, and 2013-2018 in particular, was a horrible time for container ships. These are cyclical stocks sort of like automakers or airlines or mining. Furthermore, the rates we quote and discuss are rates for 1-year and oftentimes 2-3 year deals are being signed at similar levels of strength. These aren't just 1-2 month type 'spot' rates.\n\n2) Is this like \"tankers\" I got burned there and I believe shipping sucks:\n\nTankers were earning literal all-time record highs last Spring, but these were just for 30-80 day voyages. Unlike containers, the rates were record highs, no prior precedent for long-term duration. Also, unlike containers, the duration was 30-80 days, not 1-3 years. Finally, unlike containers, the tanker rates were driven by a very short-term arbitrage due to collapsing oil prices. Containers were already strong in late-2019 on a major cyclical upswing before temporarily being interrupted by COVID.\n\n3) Isn't all this rate strength only due to COVID-19 and will go away soon:\n\nContainerships were already in a massive upturn during 2019 and into the very start of 2020. Then COVID interrupted all this and rates briefly collapsed. Yes, port delays and other issues from COVID are helping keep rates higher, but this isn't just a temporary dislocation like tankers, the rates were already strong without COVID.\n\n4) Shipping is a horrible sector and nobody can every make money in it!\n\nI hear this a lot. It's just not true if you have access to good research and are nimble with your positions. I've beaten the industry average for 6 of 6 years (2015-2021 YTD) and I've beaten the Russell 2000 for 5 of 6 years (all except for 2020 where underperformed). It is important to watch out for governance. DryShips was one example of a horribly managed firm.\n\n5) Won't liners just order more ships and destroy this amazing market:\n\nThe average delivery window for new ships ordered today is between mid-2023 and mid-2024. They can order them sure, and some have been, but this won't make much of any impact on current rates/balance. The shipping world erroneously believed that midsize tonnage was obsolete (i.e. either go huge for big scale or go really small for niche coastal trades), but that turned out to be completely wrong. Therefore there were almost zero midsized ships ordered between 2012-2020 and the fleet is fairly middleaged to older on average. Fleet growth might even be negative in some areas.\n\n***Disclosure:*** I’m long nearly every name in the space- Atlas Corp, Capital Partners, Danaos Corp, MPC Containers (on the Oslo exchange), Navios Containers, Navios Partners, and Zim Integrated. I have a medium-term to longer-term constructive view on this space, but I do take profits to rationalize my portfolio when things surge. \"Diamond hands\" is a dumb meme. If there's a lot of volatility, I might be a seller or switch positions (for example, I sold CMRE earlier this morning and rolled it into ZIM).\n\nI have about 10% of my wealth in the Navios names. Average basis in Navios Containers is in the lower-$1s after buying a lot this summer at 70-80c. I previously sold 20% on 4 January at $4.44 and I sold 20% on 14 January at $5.49. I will probably sell another 15-20% in the $7s. I disclose all of my positions and trades in real-time (or as real-time as possible) on my research platform.\n\n***Nothing in this post constitutes investment advice in ANY fashion.*** I'm just a guy sharing my positions and research and talking about what I like and what I own.

Thank old Joe!\n\nJust google “top solar companies” and tell me which have the best product and best customer ratings.\n\nSunpower is currently at a peak of a year long run up and now is nearly 60% available shares shorted. It also has had a good consolidation in the last week so no is a great time to buy.\n\nWhat most people don’t know, is, that Sunpower has started to roll out a new product that will consume market share from everyone’s favorite, Tesla. The product is called SunVault. SunVault is an energy storage battery that very well competes and rivals the Tesla power wall. I believe that SunVault will sell extremely well and could bring Sunpower up to Tesla levels in terms of solar and energy storage. The product is capable of powering your home for nearly 3 days. And when combined with the high efficiency panels that Sunpower offers, it’s game changing. \n\nSunVault only started rolling out last summer and Solar doesn’t really pick up till the summer. So getting in now before the busy season may be advantageous.\n\nIf you are looking for a company that is fundamentally strong and has a high upside in a huge market, SPWR really could be something to consider.\n\nthis is not investment advice.
