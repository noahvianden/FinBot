Earlier this month, it was reported that Jia said he had sold his stake in Lucid Motors for several hundred million dollars. Lucid would be delighted to see the back of Jia and any lingering association with the troubled Faraday Future. However, a source close to Lucid says that reports of Jia selling his shares are probably untrue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2019 --NO GRANT\n\nMeanwhile, development of the $60,000 Lucid Air has been proceeding well, and it was recently shown reaching 235 mph on a test track. However, Lucid has had its own setbacks, including abandoning attempts to design its own self-driving technology in favor of using a semi-autonomous system from Mobileye, now part of Intel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLucid plans to build an assembly plant in China, which would be financed entirely by local and regional government incentives. The site of its proposed U.S. factory, Casa Grande, Ariz., is being somewhat less generous. Lucid has a $1.5 million job-training grant from Arizona and is negotiating a further $5 million grant, according to a spokesperson for the state’s commerce authority. It could also apply for a tax credit program worth up to another $40 million.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, the make-or-break loan for the $700 million facility would be a U.S. Department of Energy program to help build advanced-technology car plants. Tesla benefited from a $465 million DOE loan in 2010, while Ford secured one for $5.9 billion. But because the loan reimburses expenses rather than paying them up front, Lucid cannot move forward until it has financing in place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLucid began its fourth round of institutional fundraising earlier this year, with the help of investment bank Morgan Stanley. Ford’s acquisition offer came as a surprise, said a source close to Lucid: “The bank approached Ford to see if they wanted to participate in the Series D. They came back and said they wanted to acquire.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-- possible relation?\n\n[https://whalewisdom.com/filer/hellman-friedman-capital-partners-viii-lp#tabform4\\_tab\\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/hellman-friedman-capital-partners-viii-lp#tabform4_tab_link)\n\n[https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ppd-2](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ppd-2)\n\n[https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ppd-2?selected\\_quarter=79](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ppd-2?selected_quarter=79)\n\n1291.59% change in CALLS\n\nCCX & MPLN --> Is relation to PPD in anyway? \\*just idea rabbit hole\n\n[https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/07/16598826/multiplan-to-go-public-in-a-merger-deal-with-spac-churchill-capital-at-11b-valuation](https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/07/16598826/multiplan-to-go-public-in-a-merger-deal-with-spac-churchill-capital-at-11b-valuation)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf relation between PPD and MPLN:\n\n[https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ppd-2](https://whalewisdom.com/stock/ppd-2)\n\nH&F CORPORATE INVESTORS VII, LTD. | Was largest investor, sold\n\nAssuming for Lucid/CCIV/CSS/MPLN 32% ownership.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nZip of PDFs cited [https://file.io/W0qyUHa9lLIw](https://file.io/W0qyUHa9lLIw)\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nDraw your own conclusions but this is a quick rundown of what I see. Lucid started out ok as Atieva USA. They tried to move into building EVs. Finance was always the problem, no one would back them, or at least for long. Pulling up the compnays webpage, goes back to 2017. Mostly unchanged over the years. Same vague statements, promises, etc. Lucid only stays afloat by, for lack of a better word, tricking someone into financing them, or, money is government. Looks like they they got AZ caught in the trap. The only play they have is to try and get grant money. \"Lucid has a $1.5 million job-training grant from Arizona and is negotiating a further $5 million grant, according to a spokesperson for the state’s commerce authority. It could also apply for a tax credit program worth up to another $40 million.\" This is after burning through BAIC and LeEco. Ford didn't bite. I cannot find the link for the life of me, but they do not qualify for the same type of grants Tesla got, they have already tried fed money. They ended up on Equityzen for bottom barrel, wile CCIV pushes them which brings us to today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2019, they just aren't around. Didn't file any paperwork that I can find. !flag\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis stinks of a rotten kickstarter, make claims, more claims, then excuses, and more excuses. The same lines have been said for years. They were going to have cars rolling in 2018, nope. Lies, to provide jobs and all these wonderful things. Solar. Freakin. Roadways. But this gets them the grants to stay around a bit more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you had a SPAC going, it would be super nice if you could get the stock to somehow ramp up to an absurd level, so you can cash out. I mean, that would just be total luck if you knew you were going bust.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think they have any vehicles other than their alpha prototypes that were made way back with BAIC. Every pic / story / article from the last 3 years are all identical. Most of the pics etc I can find are all renderings. I would wager that the \"alpha\" prototype, is from 2017, and it's the only damn thing they have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCall it good or bad, but they don't hold anything great for tech. They have failed at auto pilot pretty hard (if they are even bothering to try), and supposedly went with some MS product. I see they have some patents, but this is so.. so.. basic... There is literally nothing new about any of this one [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=10901019&OS=10901019&RS=10901019](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=10901019&OS=10901019&RS=10901019) it's just padded out with random crap just to secure a patent.

Lucid literally just used a run of the mill company whose sole purpose is to setup \"shell\" or paper companies in DE. Which is nothing new for anyone, at all, by any stretch of the imagination. There's a reason so many companies register in DE, it's a tax haven state. It's simply just more or less a way to remove yourself to an extent from a business, and \"operate\" elsewhere where things like taxes are better, hell even Trump is registered there. There's nothing illegal about it, in fact, if I were to start a company, I would literally do the exact same thing. I should have clarified I meant it more as a comment than anything negative. However, to play devils advocate, when you register like that, it does make doing things you shouldn't a little easier. Not implying they are, just stating that it does. \"CORPORATION SERVICE COMPANY\" Is THE agent, their only affiliation with Lucid is just to manage the paper. In short, they act at a trust on behalf of Lucid. \\*\\*\\* I just want to be clear, I'm not negatively saying anything about this, or implying anything, I am just trying to clarify.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm just going to go with what is on paper. Lucid has, lets face it, a pretty shitty history. Was started by (I forget their name, Ex-Tesla guy) as a battery company. I'm not sure what all happened, but between 2017-2019 (also let's not forget they don't exist as far as I can tell in 2019) ownership changed. I don't know who these new people are, and that's all I have to comment on that. But, it was decided they will build cars now. Ok cool. So they pair up with BAIC and LeEco. I would speculate, that one if not both of them, was probably majority responsible for the alpha car. At the time they were talking about building in China, Lucid is partnered up with Chinese companies after all, and expanding to the states. Not a horrible idea for the time, and I find that's actually pretty common, one foot in China, one in the US, eventually make the step over.\n\nFor whatever reason, that went to shit.\n\nHere's where I have to speculate again. Where does Lucid stand? Again, with the partnership, I think it's reasonable enough to assume that BAIC and LeEco did the heavy lifting of actually prototyping something. They are in the business, that's what they do, the owners of Lucid, literally zero experience, no manufacturing facilities, nothing. I would inherently call them worthless at this point. More or less, you have a crew of guys, with a prototype of a car they probably had little to do with as far as the actual build or manufacturing goes, now sitting with nothing. We are back in the worthless boat I feel. All I could see is a company with an idea, debt, a prototype, and zero means to pursuer actually doing anything to move forward. I'm GUESSING this is 2019, and where we first see Ford. It seems reasonable enough, why Ford would probably not be very interested in them. They really have nothing to bring to the table. Again, a crew of people, with an idea, with a prototype they probably didn't design/build, with no background in this area, and I wouldn't be shocked if they didn't even know how it all worked. Pretty much bringing zero to the table, actually all they are bringing is debt. There's nothing there, no value, anything.\n\nSo I'm going to pause here. And acknowledge yes, this is a LOT of speculation. We are in the \\~2018 area right now, so let's look at whats going on. I recall, a newly elected official, who really had a hard on for starting a trade war with China. That was painful stepping into personally, I was pretty China tech heavy in my portfolio, and it took a way bigger beat down than I had anticipated. So given everything I can google, everything I have laid out, seems like a logical series of events. Speculation yes, but personally I find very plausible.\n\nSide step #2, I look at their webhosting. From 2010 - 07/2016 it was a lot of nothing mostly, and not very relevant to anything anyways. Sometime after 07/2017 and 02/2019 there just isn't a webpage, rather, it's spotty. I can't help but think, if you're a serious company, how do you not have a hosted site? I dug through on the way back machine, I didn't look at every single snapshot ever, but enough to get the jist. It's... pretty pathetic, very vague, no real information ever, just lots of hype keywords and fancy packaging, fancy stock photos, fancy rendered images, but really zero content or information. Personally, I just can't take someone like that too seriously. I would put it on par when I get someones \"business email address\" and it's \"@gmail\" or yahoo.... just... screams \"I'm not professional\" to me. Domains and hosting cost like nothing, c'mon, present yourself in a serious manner.\n\nOk back on to it.\n\nSo we have established, Lucid is more than likely a worthless company carrying debt and that's about all they have going for them. I feel for them personally, that's gotta suck really hard, I'm sure that was not fun at all. And this is where they pivot.\n\nJust ask for money! I mean, that's about it, in reality. Beg. Beg for money from anyone. Can't really fault them, I mean what would you do? Probably have a mount of debt, mortgages to pay, mouths to feed, you WANT to make your company work. Somewhere in the pile of links and pages, they eventually get some investors. And this is the part where I just start to see... a lot of general stupidness going on.\n\nThey get some financing, great, and of all things Ford comes back. But they want to acquire now. Again, speculation, but lets assume that the financing they did get, just dug them out of the hole they had, let's even give them the benefit of the doubt and say they developed a \\*something\\* that had value to it. They are sitting there with an opportunity to hit a reset button. And they refuse. Ok....\n\nAnd now we get more weird, finally in comes PIF. On one hand, man, I can kinda empathize. 1 billion dollars. That's a lot. But they are going to take 67% of the company.\n\nThis makes no sense to me. Why? Besides money, what is PIF bringing to the table? Again, keep in mind, all they have again is probably some debt thats getting paid off, some prototypes, give them the benefit of the doubt of building a \\*something\\* that has value to the EV space, and that's it.\n\nWhat is the plan here? I can only assume they at best case scenario had 2 choices. 1 go with Ford, who is known, willing to buy, has manufacturing facilities, has all the logistics of taking sheet metal and making a car, all the missing pieces they need. 2 take the billion, and fucking hope I guess? I feel that given the position they were in, that's a pretty hard gamble to take, considering all the years of shit they went through. And again, they still, really, don't HAVE ANYTHING. Prototypes, hopes, dreams, that's about it.\n\nEdit: See my reply to my own post. I wrote too much.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Pt2\n\nThey take the billion.

I see owners who don't own anything anymore. With over 1 billion dollars, but, still missing things like logistics... 1 plant? If there was a company 5 year plan, I would LOVE to see what that looked like. This just doesn't make any sense to me. Now I'm not saying they CAN'T build their own plant. But think about it. Starting from 0. You have to 1 build the plant, buy the machinery, employees, all the paperwork overhead, source raw materials, deal with literally the base logistics of who to buy from, where to go, how are you going to market? how are you going to sell said car? I could go on for pages about all the things they would have to build ground up. Again, going back to Ford.... could have skipped all that messy work.\n\nAnd now, lets still keep in mind. Zero experience, they still really don't actually have a marketable and sell able vehicle, which again, they probably originally have very little to actually do with the first prototype. And yes, give them the benefit of the doubt they have a \\*something\\* of value.\n\nNow all I see, is a few people, a boatload of money, I'm just gonna say a full on loose plan on what to even do. I mean, they accomplished ALL of this in 1 year. 1 year they say. I just, really, do not see how you can go from nothing, to full production from ground up scratch, sheet metal to car on the lot for sale, in a year or even 2 year time span. I just do not see it. I mean, throw COVID in now too. Metal, it's damn expensive, semi conductors? VW, the 2nd largest manufacture in the world, has to shut down plant because they cannot get the electronics made. And you're launching a ground up 1 year rushed EV company with some very lofty promises, during COVID, and I'm just gonna guess a buttload more electronics than a normal car.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is something wrong with this picture. I don't know what it is, but I just have a real hard time believing it. Honestly, and I'm not implying they are doing / going to do this, it really, bottom line, just smells like a scam to me. Someone is making money and it's not through Lucid. I don't know if it's just siphoning off funds the traditional way, I could think of a hundred ways to rig the system in their position. I just really don't feel that this is going to happen.\n\nI am a gambling man. And if I had to bet between seeing a Lucid car on the street, or reading about a new Enron scam, I'm taking Enron on this one. $50/p no dice for me, I just don't see it happening.\n\nEdit: Also, forgot to re-mention, that CCIV isn't what PIF or Hellman & Friedman Capital Partners VIII, L.P. are in for. They are backed by CCXX now  MPLN. So no one, is really on the hook for CCIV. If the merger doesn't happen, the warrants are void, and the stock (CCIV) dumps. Of which, no, what I will say, reputable hedge funds are even touching. I just see a non-company with stocks they are not on the hook for, with zero interest from any major players, mostly just WSB style shenanigans.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: Bottom line. I only see a haphazard put together company, that's changed hands a few times, with what I believe, really nothing of value. Personally, I don't even understand Lucid. Why? I don't understand who the target demographic is, I don't understand who or why anyone would buy one. And it just looks, looks like a tesla clone. If I had to pick, why should I buy Lucid over Tesla? I just see nothing of incentive or value in that area, only risk. A few coke bags short of an EV Delorean. The timing seems rushed, the promises seem lofty (remember they were going to deliver in 2018 too), it all and all seems like one massive company gamble. And I'll harp on the 2019 filing as well. Unless I'm just not seeing it, having a gap in your corporations filing fees, is just a red flag. If you didn't have car insurance for a year, and you go to sign up, and they see a gap, you get a red flag. Because something, probably isn't right.

{"title": "YOLO on WPG - 300% upside by Feb End", "selftext": "Hello! I'd like to explain a brief analysis of a stock / REIT I'm all-in on. It's called Washington Prime Group. They operate a series of malls, and they're currently massively undervalued from a market cap perspective, as well as stock-value wise. I see them as a good long-term hold.\n\nNotes about the stock:\n\n1. They're a REIT\n2. They have a massive dividend\n3. They did a 1:9 reverse split because of NYSE listing compliance.\n\nWhy are they undervalued?  \n\n\nEveryone's been fleeing retail, and their ownership of malls in the pandemic has resulted in them suspending their normal dividend. They've needed to increase debt load somewhat to last the pandemic, but they're not in the situation people seem to think where this will apply problems to their business. Their suspension of the dividend has also resulted in a huge depression in value, and because most investors don't know REITs are different from typical businesses, their financial statements look terrible. See the \"what is a REIT\" section below explaining why even though their financials don't look great, it's not a big deal.\n\nRisk: There's a lot of risk in malls right now, and the pandemic isn't over.\n\nUpside:\n\nWPG has a huge upside, particularly if their dividend is re-instated during their next earnings release at the end of February. If they fully re-instate the dividend, it's likely they'll go up 400% based on previous prices. I think it's likely they'll at least 50% re-instate the dividend, and the stock will double in price. I'm holding for the long-term because I think their rental & ownership potential is great, and at a 50% price / dividend rate, any stock is a crazy good buy.\n\nWhat is a REIT?\n\nIt's a corporate structure of ownership for real estate. It means each share is backed by renters and property. Oftentimes, this property is secured via a loan. All profits are released at a 90% ratio to shareholders as a dividend. REITs focus on maintaining & releasing dividends rather than growth. It also means that basic GAP measures for accounting don't display the true value of the business, due to depreciation. In analysis of the 10-Q, they've got \\~$6B of property and \\~$1.5B of debt, with a large amount of depreciation remaining. Typically, a REIT's evaluated by their FFO or Funds From Operation, and in their 10-Q in September, they posted a $.07 vs. $.45 FFO per share. This indicates that their recovery started.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI'm betting that WPG restores at least 50% of their dividend for 2021 in their meeting at the end of February, and resumes normal operations with a $9/share equivalent dividend (after their reverse split). This means the stock is trading at (likely) 50-100% of dividend & will likely appreciate 2-3x current price as the dividend is restored.\n\nDisclosure: I'm long on WPG, and intend to hold.", "id": "lh07an", "created_utc": 1612981825.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "Anyone else thinking when the last time they went to a mall was?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I'm in a different REIT for this very reason, they own very little retail space.

{"title": "$RESN - Resonant Inc - 5G play. My first DD", "selftext": "I got involved with trading recently and have loved seeing all the amazing DD some of you put together. So I figured it's time I give back. I haven't seen $RESN talked about recently so I decided to do a bit of a dive on it. (I apologize beforehand for lack of meme-speak and rockets)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nResonant Inc, a late-stage development company, designs and develops filters for radio frequency (RF) and front-ends used in the mobile device, automotive, medical, Internet-of-things, and related industries in the United States and internationally. It uses Infinite Synthesized Networks technology, a software platform to configure and connect resonators that are building blocks of RF filters.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhy is this important? Resonant ($RESN) makes products for mobile and IoT devices that connect through 5G. Their technology allows to filter out lower frequencies that can overlap with 5G frequencies, critical as the RF spectrum becomes more and more congested. This technology has the potential to be in every 5G device.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the beginning of 2020, they signed a strategic investment and a licensing agreement to design 5G RF filters with their XBAR® technology, with Murata Manufacturing, THE biggest RF Filter and Duplexer manufacturer in the world. (Source: Navian, 2019)\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn late December 2020, the company released a letter to shareholders indicating that they surpassed a shipment milestone of 50Million RF Filters, among other encouraging news. [source link](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/28/2150894/0/en/Resonant-Issues-Shareholder-Letter-and-Provides-Corporate-Update.html)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYesterday, February 9th 2021, they provided prelim FY2020 results, showing revenues increased 330% YoY to a Record $3.2 Million. Also reported that as of December 31, 2020, Resonant had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $25.0 million, which included $11.0 million of net proceeds from sales of equity under the Company’s previously announced at-the-market (ATM) program. And as far as I can tell, no debt.

Resonant has reached a milestone with Murata Manufacturing allowing them to move to the next phase of building a commercial platform & high-volume manufacturing of XBAR-based RF filters for 5G.

The best part is, they have opted for an intellectual property licensing business model, in the manner of Qualcomm, ARM and others.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n$RESN seems to still fly under the radar but has a good runaway to go for 2021.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on this one!
