DUR-928, the company's lead drug candidate is in clinical development for the potential treatment of alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH), COVID-19 patients with acute liver or kidney injury, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). DURECT's proprietary drug delivery technologies are designed to enable new indications and enhanced attributes for small-molecule and biologic drugs. One late-stage product candidate in this category is POSIMIR® (bupivacaine sustained-release solution), an investigational locally-acting, non-opioid analgesic intended to provide up to three days of continuous pain relief after surgery\n\n-DURECT Corporation Announces First Patient Dosed in Phase 2b AHFIRM Study of DUR-928 in Severe Alcohol-Associated Hepatitis\n\nDURECT's lead drug candidate, DUR-928, is an endogenous sulfated oxysterol and an epigenetic regulator. It represents a new class of therapeutics with a unique mechanism of action. DUR-928 epigenetically modulates the expression of multiple clusters of master genes that are involved in many important cell signaling pathways, through which it stabilizes mitochondria, reduces lipotoxicity, regulates inflammatory or stress responses, and promotes cell survival.\n\nAHFIRM is a Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the potential life-saving capacity of DUR-928 in patients with severe AH. AHFIRM is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multi-center study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DUR-928 in approximately 300 patients with severe AH. The study will be comprised of three arms of approximately 100 patients each: (1) DUR-928 (30 mg); (2) DUR-928 (90 mg); and (3) Placebo plus standard of care (SOC). SOC may include the use of methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, at the discretion of the treating physician. Patients will receive an intravenous (IV) dose of DUR-928 or placebo (sterile water) on day 1 and a second IV dose on day 4 if they are still hospitalized. The primary outcome measure will be 90-day survival rate for patients treated with DUR-928 compared to those treated with placebo plus SOC.  Secondary endpoints include 28-day survival, the rate of adverse events, Lille and MELD (prognostic scores), and time in the intensive care unit. The Company is targeting 40-50 clinical trial sites in the US and Europe. For more information, refer to ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04563026\n\n\n\n\n\n-DURECT Corporation Announces U.S. FDA Approval of POSIMIR® For Post-Surgical Pain Reduction for up to 72 Hours Following Arthroscopic Subacromial Decompression\n\nDURECT Corporation (Nasdaq: DRRX) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved POSIMIR® (bupivacaine solution) for infiltration use in adults for administration into the subacromial space under direct arthroscopic visualization to produce post-surgical analgesia for up to 72 hours following arthroscopic subacromial decompression. The approval was based on positive data from a randomized, multicenter, assessor-blinded, placebo–controlled clinical trial in patients undergoing arthroscopic subacromial decompression surgery with an intact rotator cuff. The primary outcome measures were mean pain intensity and total opioid rescue analgesia administered, both evaluated over the first 72 hours after surgery versus placebo. POSIMIR demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in both primary outcome measures: a 1.3 point, or 20%, reduction in mean pain intensity on a 0-10 point pain scale (p=0.01), and a 67% reduction in I.V. morphine-equivalent rescue opioid use, from a median of 12 mg in the placebo group to 4 mg in the POSIMIR group (p=0.01). Please see important safety information including the Boxed Warning below and the POSIMIR full prescribing information.\n\n\"We are excited to announce the approval of POSIMIR, a novel, non-opioid, sustained-release local analgesic for the treatment of post-surgical pain following arthroscopic subacromial decompression surgery,\" said James E. Brown, President and CEO of DURECT. \"This FDA approval provides an important new option to help orthopedic surgeons in their efforts to minimize opioid use while managing acute pain for up to 72 hours after this painful surgery.\"\n\n\"In my experience, POSIMIR was easy to administer into the subacromial space under arthroscopic guidance, where it can directly address the source of postsurgical pain,\" said Sten Rasmussen, MD CBE PhD, Associate Professor, Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Aalborg University Hospital, and Professor and Head of the Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Denmark, a principal investigator in the POSIMIR registration trial. \"A non-opioid product providing up to three days of local analgesia would be a significant benefit to patients.\"\n\n\"The first 72 hours after surgery are typically when patients experience the most severe postsurgical pain,\" said T J Gan, MD MHS FRCA MBA, Professor and Distinguished Endowed Chair, Department of Anesthesiology at Stony Brook University Renaissance School of Medicine. \"So, a new sustained-release product providing continuous analgesia during this critical period is a welcome addition to the armamentarium for anesthesiologists and surgeons, especially as we aim to reduce the use of postsurgical opioids whenever possible.\"\n\nAbout POSIMIR\n\nPOSIMIR (bupivacaine solution) for infiltration use is a novel and proprietary product that combines the strength of 660 mg of bupivacaine base with the innovative SABER® platform technology, enabling continuous sustained delivery of a non-opioid local analgesic over 3 days in adults. POSIMIR contains more bupivacaine than any other approved single-dose sustained-release bupivacaine product. At the end of surgery, POSIMIR is administered into the subacromial space under direct arthroscopic visualization, where it continuously releases bupivacaine for 72 hours or more. DURECT is in discussions with potential partners regarding the licensing of commercialization rights to POSIMIR, for which DURECT holds worldwide rights.\n\nAbout Subacromial Decompression Shoulder Surgery\n\nSubacromial decompression is a type of shoulder surgery used to treat impingement syndrome, a common repetitive-use injury that causes pain when the arm is raised over the head. The procedure is typically performed arthroscopically, meaning that several small incisions are made in the skin and muscle of the shoulder through which a camera lens (arthroscope) and surgical instruments are inserted during surgery. Arthroscopic subacromial decompression is generally considered outpatient surgery, and most patients go home within a few hours of surgery. The recovery period may extend from weeks to months, but the most intense pain typically occurs during the first 3 days after surgery and is often managed with oral opioids. There are over 600,000 surgeries involving arthroscopic subacromial decompression performed each year in the U.S.\n\nPostmarketing Requirements\n\nIn connection with this approval, the Company or its licensee, will be required to conduct two postmarketing non-clinical studies.\n\nIndications and Usage\n\nPOSIMIR (bupivacaine solution) for infiltration use is indicated in adults for administration into the subacromial space under direct arthroscopic visualization to produce post-surgical analgesia for up to 72 hours following arthroscopic subacromial decompression.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-DURECT Corporation to Sell its LACTEL® Absorbable Polymer Product Line to Evonik for $15 Million\n\nDURECT Corporation (Nasdaq: DRRX) announced that it has signed an agreement to sell its LACTEL Absorbable Polymer (LACTEL) product line to Evonik, a global leader in specialty chemicals.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Evonik will pay DURECT $15 million in exchange for certain assets and liabilities associated with LACTEL product line based in Birmingham, Alabama, plus an additional potential payment based on full year EBITDAS results. The transaction is expected to close by Q1 2021 pending the satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions. An offer will be extended to each of the 15 employees of DURECT located in Birmingham, Alabama, which are associated with the LACTEL® business to transition to Evonik.\n\n\"It has been a pleasure working with the highly motivated and talented LACTEL team. We have confidence that Evonik will apply its resources and commitment to excellence to enable the LACTEL product line and supporting team members to thrive,\" said James E. Brown, President and CEO of DURECT. \"This deal makes strategic sense for DURECT as we continue to focus on epigenetic regulation and the development of DUR-928 for alcohol-associated hepatitis and other acute organ injury and chronic liver diseases. We wish all of our LACTEL colleagues the very best going forward.\"\n\n\"The acquisition of the LACTEL® business will strengthen both our innovation growth field Healthcare Solutions and Evonik's position as a globally leading CDMO for drug delivery solutions,\" says Johann-Caspar Gammelin, Head of the Nutrition & Care Division of Evonik. \"The acquisition of the LACTEL® business marks a consequential step in the growth agenda of the life-science division Nutrition & Care.

Nothing exact, but anything more specific than that feels like I'm trying to convince myself of something. Each band is a few percentage points wide for the stock to fluctuate around in, and I adjust the ranges as the situation changes or I do more research.\n\nI had done some initial research on CRSR and found it had an interesting financials and growth case, but I have a hard time buying in during a sustained run up of over 200%, especially for a new stock. So I threw it in a watchlist and focused on other stuff.  There was a second big drop of the stock in late Jan that I felt wasn't really justified. The financials were still looking good, insiders weren't doing anything unexpected, so I bought in @ $38 to start establishing a position as I this seemed to me like an over correction from the initial euphoria and started digging in on research. Sentiment was all good, reviews of customer services and product quality are historically pretty good, debt compared to their acquisitions and growth was fair and justifiable, earnings growth was hinted to be good, and then the earnings beat and everyone was complaining about an \"unfair\" drop,  just looked like normal profit taking to me. I Also initially started looking into LOGI at a high level around thus time as a comparison against the \"competition\" and saw this was at about 1/3 the share cost at about 1/3 the market cap. All this confirmed to me that in a normal year I'd consider CRSR at About Right, but given the overall positive market sentiment and clamoring for growth, I felt justified in re-considering a \"normal\" About Right as \"euphoria\" Kinda Undervalued instead and worth getting more while it was low yet again into so I bought more shares @$42 and was poised to buy more dips. So my original ranges for CRSR were:\n\n* Kinda Undervalued: $40-$45\n* About Right: $45-$49\n* Kinda Overvalued (exit range): $49-$52\n\nHowever, I kept digging on research and over the last three days started to unmake my case as I described in my initial post. Comparing it to LOGI just made me interested in LOGI. And while CRSR is at 1/4 market cap, they aren't fair to view as competitors, so CRSR should probably be at less market cap. Logitech reaches a much wider customer base, makes more on their own vs. mostly (admittedly high quality) rebranding, and all the other reasons I stated previously. This made me shift my consideration of CRSR to Kinda Overvalued and LOGI to Kinda Undervalued.  This was the exact opposite finding I was hoping to come to after researching, I ws hoping to build a bigger growth case. So my new ranges for CRSR are:\n\n* Kinda Undervalued: $35-$39\n* About Right: $39-$41\n* Kinda Overvalued: $41-$43\n* Run Away (patient exit range): $43+\n\nWhile I do believe CRSR will go back to the upper $40s eventually, I'm not buying anymore unless something happens that changes my estimate of its value. And I'm not advocating that others buy in just because I'm a little underwater and looking to exit. I'm sharing what I know and starting to build a LOGI position instead.\n\nThis is not financial advice and I can afford to do this because I'm finally at a place where I am maxing retirement, have an emergency savings established, and have money left over for a high risk account as a personal challenge to myself first and profit as a close second. Maybe CRSR will explode more and I am being to conservative. I don't see a case for it, but the market is irrational so IDK. At least I know enough to be confident in won't greatly implode. Since there isn't a case for me to exit at high speed, I can just sit on CRSR for a while and eventually get out at a small gain, or if I see a growth opportunity that would justify a small loss to exit and put this money to work elsewhere, or my view of CRSR changes.\n\nTL;DR - IDK if I have a good system, or one that makes sense to anyone else, but it is a system that works for me:\n\n1. Do your own research.\n2. Set a market cap-based entry and exit target range based on that research and get out when you are anywhere in your exit range if nothing changes.\n3.

{"title": "DD $PERI - Perion Network a growth company in digital ads with 200% upside", "selftext": "Perion Network Ltd.  - PERI\n\n**Company – What they do**\n\nPerion Network Ltd. $PERI is a global technology company based in Israel and listed on NASDAQ  that is in the business of digital advertising. Company's diversified  business model includes products and services that are used across the  three main pillars of digital advertising, which are:\n\n1. Search\n2. Social display ads\n3. Video (display advertising)\n\nThe  other important thing to remember is that Google , Facebook  tend to  through their weight around, as they control 85% of ad spend. This means  brands, advertisers, and publishers tend to look for friendlier and  flexible alternatives that respect their brands and need for  monetization.\n\nTheir main competitors/peers are The Trade Desk ($TTD) and Magnite (MGNI).\n\n**Market**\n\nDigital  advertising is a 20% yoy growing market which is estimated to value 542  billion dollars in 2024 divided in the 3 main segments:\n\n1. Search Ad: $211B\n2. Social display ads: $157B\n3. Video (display advertising): $173B\n\nPerion’s  main business until 3 years ago was the low margin and slow growth “ad  search channel” and this was the reason of the low multiples applied to  the stock price; in the last 2 years it is on a turnaround path and  through integration of their systems as well as acquisition of companies  such as ContentIQ and Pub Ocean it is starting now to deliver, just when the digital advertising  industry is showing signs of stability after suffering one of huge  downturns due to COVID-19.\n\n**Financials and Valuation**\n\n[https://www.perion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perion-IR-deck-11022021.pdf](https://www.perion.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/perion-IR-deck-11022021.pdf)\n\nPERI has a strong balance sheet with $113M in cash ($3.5/share in cash) and $8M debt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||EV/revenues|EV/EBITDA|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|PERI|2|18|\n|MGNI|23|114|\n|TTD|36|114|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPERI  had $328M revenue in 2020 and an EV of 643M. It is trading for an  EV/Revenue = 2. To give a comparison, The Trade Desk ($TTD) is valued 36  EV/Revenue, Magnite ($MGNI) 23 EV/Revenue. Even considering other  competitors, the average EV/Rev for the sector is 13 while PERI is  trading at 1/7 of peers.\n\nIf we  consider the EV/EBITDA, PERI is trading at 18 EV/EBITDA while the main  competitors (MGNI and TTD) are valued 114 EV/EBITDA and average for the  sector is 56 EV/EBITDA. (69$ per share following this metric)\n\nNow,  the reason for this big difference in multiples is the fact that the  market still sees PERI mainly as an ad search company with limited  growth: MGNI and TTD will have a growth of 30% next year. What about  PERI with their AD Search stagnant revenues ? the company moved on developing the video and social ad segments in last 2 years. Let’s have a look at 2020 revenues :\n\nRevenues from Search AD: $179.4 M +3% yoy (low growth as expected)\n\n`Revenues from Display and Social $AD: 148.7M, +69% yoy`(So Display and Social segment showed a +70% growth despite covid19.!)\n\nRecently  MGNI acquired SpotX (company specialized only in CTV and Video ads) for  $1.17 billion or 10x SpotX revenues ($ 116M). To give an idea, PERI  revenues in Display and Social are 148.7M as we will see below. So based  on this real “market benchmark”, PERI Video and Social segment (even  ignoring the AD Search) should be worth $ 1.5 billion (so $46/share). By  adding the Search AD we are still near north of $60/share valuation.\n\nIn  short, PERI stock price should be valued north of 60$ per share based  on the valuation of other companies in the market. Considering it is  trading at 2x revenues, it is cheap not only in comparison of other  companies but also on an stand alone valuation.\n\nCompany  provided a very conservative guidance (+10% for 2021) but as they did  in previous years, management prefers to set a low guidance and then  rise it during the year. Considering the growth of revenues in 2020  despite covid, it should be easy to meet at least a 15/20% growth in  2021 in a market that is foreseen for rising in the next years.\n\n**Risks**\n\nA  huge recession or a new wave of COVID19 by impacting the ads market as a  whole would probably impact 2021 guidance. In addition, the Search Ad  segment is much dependent from their 4 years deal with Microsoft.\n\nPerhaps  the biggest threat is competition. PERI operates in the highly  competitive ad tech industry which is constantly evolving. Failure to  consistently innovate could lead to market share losses.\n\n**Final Summary**\n\nPERI  is a severely undervalued company which has successfully turned around  focusing on Video and Social ads. It is still a “show me” story where  the company has to confirm the growth reached in 2020 despite covid19.\n\nConsidering  its peers as well as any metric, price target should be **$45 by year end  (+100% upside**) if they respect management guidance in a conservative  scenario and could be **>60$ if they beat guidance (as they did in last  years)**.\n\nFeel free to comment or ask more information if you like my DD.\n\n*The contents on this thread are for informational purposes only and does* ***not*** *constitute* ***financial***, *accounting, or legal advice.

However, H&amp;R Block is pivoting to a digital-age company (or at least trying to.) Last year, they added 3 VPs of information technology and acquired Wave Financial, a financial SaaS company funded by Social Capital. \n\n2) They have been buying back shares. Lots of shares. HRB's shares outstanding has fallen from 300m+ to under 200m since 2010, thanks to their share repurchase program. In 2015, HRB approved a $3.5b share repurchase program and they still have $600m of that which will fund their buy-backs into 2022. To put that into perspective: HRB's current market cap is $3.6b. They've been consistently buying back shares AND paying their dividends for over a decade. These repurchases also show up as losses in earnings report, thus giving the appearance of poor results to those who don't look carefully. When you compare its current price (\\~$19) to its price in, say, 2019 (\\~$26), don't forget that there are now \\~10% less outstanding shares compared to back then!\n\n3) Almost one year later, HRB still hasn't recovered to its pre-covid share price. In fact, even S&P has gained 75% from its March lows, while HRB only gained 59%. Looking at historical price data, HRB had its strongest run in '01 and '12: both about two years after the market recovers from a major downtown. Will 2022 be the year HRB reaches new ATH? I think so.\n\n4) Rise in retail investing. To keep this short: if your tax situation is simple (just wages and a couple of deductible items) you can probably figure out how to file your taxes on your own. If you've been investing, however, you are better off talking to a tax professional. (Did you know that you may be able to offset taxable income up to $3000 if you have capital losses that exceed capital gains in a year?)\n\n5) Something something death and taxes\n\nIV on leaps are not bad right now. I bought some 2023 $25C for $1.77 the other day, and it's one of the cheapest leaps in my portfolio. \n\nDisclaimer: HRB 2023 20c and 25c x 10. This is not investment or tax advice. I like the stock.\n\n[Bear case](https://supercoolofficestuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/236-ktvlvh.jpg)\n\nEdit: sorry forgot 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀", "id": "llok83", "created_utc": 1613545790.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "See I hear what you’re saying but man do I hate how tax companies lobby to make taxes more complicated than necessary.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Agreed.

Basically, there is absolutely *zero oversight* for non-Authorized Participant shareholders holding <50k blocks (or just regular participants holding >50k for that matter).

You mean that they can't possibly [spoof trades](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html) right? But if they can do that with a wrist-slap, what's stopping them from also spoofing paper, when they can just say the bullion they're keeping is on Mars and temporarily out of reach? You have no right to inspect anyway, unless you're the former-JP shill now at the SEC.\n\nSo how could they get caught short of a whistleblower? And if that happens, how would this work out in practice if SLV busts, leading to a SLV ETF run on the bank scenario or liquidation?\n\nWould this structure actually insulate the Custodian from a law suit / fiduciary duty to shareholders? Is Trustee the only party that can recover, and shareholders thereby recover from Trustee but they would have to prove another layer of negligence? Maybe an SEC lawyer or intern can answer this.
