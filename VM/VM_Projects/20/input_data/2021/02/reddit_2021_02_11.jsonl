{"title": "Replicating Tastywork's P50 calculations", "selftext": "I recently tried to replicate how Tastywork calculates their P50 (Probability of hitting 50% profit) and managed to successfully replicate it in R. Not sure if this is an appropriate forum but just thought I'd share it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g46v2za7zsg61.png?width=1624&format=png&auto=webp&s=997f2f9a19eaa56e4ae23113f8c36cb0a33cd238\n\nI looked at Tastywork's AAPL option chain and decided to replicate the P50 for the 122.5 Put, with 37 days to go.\n\nI first simulated the stock price of AAPL over the next 37 days, performing a 1000 simulations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eg7ax576zsg61.png?width=797&format=png&auto=webp&s=f17d10fedc9bb0d273eee5c9045e5912c29a281c\n\nI then used the Black-Scholes Model to calculate the price of the Put over the next 37 days, following the 1000 price paths (taking into account time decay etc.). This is a slice of 10 of those 1000 paths for the Put prices\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/23oqsmd7zsg61.png?width=797&format=png&auto=webp&s=b868703d1d61f0f17d12c93703cf766dfb70b9f8\n\n    query <- plottest %>% dplyr::filter(price<0.85) %>% group_by(sim) %>% slice_head()\n    cat(\"P50: \",(nrow(query)/1000))\n    \n    ## P50: 0.859\n\nFinally, I calculated the P50 and viola! it turns out to be 86% which is close to Tastywork's 89%!

{"title": "(2/11) Thursday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News", "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/smallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Thursday morning-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-11-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday‚Äôs record high close\n\n> * Dow futures rose Thursday, one day after the 30-stock average hit an intraday all-time high in a volatile session and closed at a record. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday were unable to hold on to their all-time intraday highs and closed slightly lower.\n\n> * The Labor Department is out at 8:30 a.m. ET with its weekly report on new jobless claims. Economists expect 760,000 filings for new unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 19,000 from the prior week, which at 779,000 was the lowest initial claims reading since late November.\n\n> * Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday monetary policy needs to stay ‚Äúpatiently accommodative‚Äù to support the economy that still faces challenges in the labor market. The employment picture is ‚Äúa long way‚Äù from where it needs to be, the central bank chief told the Economic Club of New York.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. PepsiCo beats expectations; Uber delivers mixed results\n\n> * Earnings were once again a focus for investors. Disney leads the list of major companies reporting quarterly results after Thursday‚Äôs closing bell. Before the market opening, PepsiCo reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.47 per share, a penny better than estimates. Revenue rose 8.8% to $22.46 billion, also exceeding expectations. PepsiCo shares fell slightly in the premarket.\n\n> * Uber shares dropped 4% in Thursday‚Äôs premarket, the morning after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss of 54 cents per share in the fourth quarter. However, revenue fell 16% to a lower-than-expected $3.17 billion. Uber‚Äôs ride-hailing business slowly recovered, while its delivery business boomed.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Cannabis stocks jump in a Reddit-fueled trade reminiscent of GameStop\n\n> * Cannabis stocks were soaring as the Reddit crowd that spiked GameStop jumped in. Tilray shares surged nearly 51% on Wednesday, pushing the stock to a year-to-date gain of more than 670%. Not nearly as bet-against as GameStop, Tilray‚Äôs short interest was still equal to 22.5% of the shares available for trading, according to FactSet as of the end of January. Tilary added another 10% in Thursday‚Äôs premarket. Tilray is no stranger to a short-squeeze rally. The stock spiked more than 1,400% between July and September 2018, but those gains did not last.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. Dating app firm Bumble set to begin trading after pricing IPO\n\n> * When 31-year-old Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd takes her dating app company public Thursday, she‚Äôll be noted not only for her youth but also as one of the few female founders to lead her firm to an IPO. Bumble, whose board comprises 73% women, priced its offering Wednesday evening at $43 per share, raising $2.2 billion and valuing Bumble at around $8 billion. The stock market response will act as a litmus test for companies founded by women, who account for just 7.4% of Fortune 500 CEOs. That‚Äôs an all-time high but still a staggeringly low.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. House impeachment managers to continue their case against Trump\n\n> * House managers on Thursday are set to continue to lay out their case against former President Donald Trump at his second impeachment trial. Trump‚Äôs lawyers are expected to launch their defense by the end of the week.

{"title": "DD: Missed TSMC? My bull case for Shin-Etsu.", "selftext": "Intro: Over the past few months, there have been an increasing number of posts discussing the semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry. The TLDR for these posts is that the big winner here is going to be TSMC. TSMC is the leading chip foundry in the world. It produces chips for Intel, AMD, Apple, and many others. \n\nMy thesis: The chip shortage is already priced into the current value of TSMC. I still have 9 shares of TSM, but I am going long on those. This is a shorter term play based off of the ongoing automotive semiconductor shortage. TSMC sources it's wafers from 5 suppliers, 4 of which are publicly traded. These companies are F.K.S., MEMC, S.E.H., Siltronic, SUMCO. These 5 companies produce 85% of the worlds raw wafers. Shin-Etsu produces 33% of the worlds wafers. Shin-Etsu is also positioning itself to be one of the primary producers of the chips that are invloved in the automotive industry shortage. In addition, Shin-Etsu is one of TSMC's primary suppliers of Photoresist. Finally, Shin-Etsu is based in Taiwan, TSMC is fully aware of this and is taking full advantage of the logistics advantages associated with Shin-Etsu's geographical position. \nTLDR: I think that SHECY is going to see a rapids spike in the next 6 months.\nPosition: 7 Shares SHECY @42.91 \nAdding more with my next paycheck, tax return, and stimulus.

They are first foundry that will manufacture 3nm chips starting from 2022 (entire 3nm production is already booked out by Apple btw), their new foundry in Arizona will go into production in 2024 (I‚Äôm speculating that this foundry will be serving mainly American based car companies, Tesla for instance is another important partner for TSMC. Currently they are supplying car companies with 7nm chips, the Arizona hub will be specialising in 5nm process ), and more importantly they just signed agreement to manufacture micro LED for Apple wearables (which means that their are diversifying their business model). As long as they can keep milking Moore‚Äôs Law and diversify their business they have a long bull run ahead of them.\n\nAlso, if you really want to play the semi shortage game, companies like AMAT will be more profitable bet.

In other words, their margins on semis are really solid. Given how closely intertwined their semiconductor segment is with TSMC, Shin-Etsu‚Äôs P/E should eventually creep up to match TSMC more closely. The industry shortage is pretty interesting because it‚Äôs less about the raw materials (silicon is abundant) and more about the demand for products from TSMC (since their processes are best in class by a mile). TSMC is selling product as fast as they can produce it, so their raw materials suppliers, like Shin-Etsu are also positioned to sell their wafers as fast as they can produce them. \n\nI‚Äôm moving on from some of my weaker positions at market open and definitely going in for some more shares.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
