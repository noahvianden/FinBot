I just spend it how I wanted. If I look at my friends they never really saved a lot of money either, I don't know if that's a generation thing but whenever I speak to older people (incl my parents). They can't stress enough how important setting money aside is and that they started doing so from a young age onwards. I'm well aware that setting money aside is always a good thing to do, I just could never really find the motivation to do so. Except for when I planned to buy something big in the near future, such as my car/vacations). Been working since 18 never had any money problems whatsoever I make a decent living as a long haul trucker, whilst I'm still young and can put these kind of hours in I really should start caring more about setting money aside for later. If anything ever breaks down like a washing machine I could buy a new one instantly at all times, so to a certain point I do ''save'' money. Just by far not enough I think.\n\nHowever, years ago I was already really interested in the market (Reading The big short in 2012 started it) but came to the conclusion that it was too hard to understand for me and I shouldn't step into it without knowing what I was doing.

And what is the best market for me to focus on, should I focus on big players like MSFT/AAPL/AMZN? I'm not asking for you to literally tell me where to put my money in. But perhaps you could guide me in the right way, I really don't mind taking long positions as in the end I'm only doing this to start myself off setting money aside and be more careful spending money in general (Read; don't spend it on a whole bunch of dumb/unnecessarily stuff). \n\nOr would I be better of putting my money in a mutual fund/my savings account?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI greatly appreciate any reactions and may you have any useful/interesting information for me then please do not hesitate to share it.

Munro's \"Kia\" critique came when Tesla was still struggling to meet early production targets for the Model 3.\nMusk's admission is quite a warning considering that the company is getting ready to start production of the Cybertruck pickup late this year, and is set to open new plants outside of Austin, Texas, and Berlin, Germany.\n\"Friends ask, 'When should I buy a Tesla?'\" Musk said. \"Well, either buy it right at the beginning or when production reaches steady state. During that production ramp, it's super hard to be in vertical climb mode and get everything right on the details.\"\nMunro also questioned Musk about quality control problems more recently. He bought a 2021 Model 3 late last year, and compared it to a Model 3 someone else purchased a month later -- and saw significant improvement.\n\"At the end of the day, this guy's car was fabulous ... as good as anybody could possibly do,\" Munro said. \"I just don't understand. Mine was built this month, his was built a month later. Mine had problems. His was perfect.\"\nMusk said Tesla continued to make progress even as recently as December of last year, noting that the company is finding issues more quickly as the pace of production continues to speed up.\n\"When you go faster, you just discover these things,\" he said. \"If we knew them in advance, we'd fix them in advance.\"\n>Musk also discussed some other challenges that the company has previously experienced. After Munro praised the seats in the Model 3 as the most comfortable he has ever experienced in a car, Musk volunteered that he used to refer to the seat in the early Model S, one of the company's first vehicles, as a \"stone toadstool.\"\n\"The early Model S's probably had the worst seat of any car I ever sat in,\" Musk said.\nMunro isn't the only one to highlight quality control problems at Tesla. Consumer Reports, which has praised the design of many Tesla models, said poor quality control -- including hair embedded in paint jobs -- meant it could not recommend its newest vehicle, the Model Y SUV. Of the four vehicles Tesla currently sells, only the Model 3 has the coveted \"recommended\" rating from Consumer Reports, although it briefly lost that designation in early 2019.", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}

The market appears to adjust to the earnings information only gradually, resulting in a sustained period of abnormal returns. ...

{"title": "Silver Shiny Me Likey (Read disclaimer b4 downvote GME gang)", "selftext": "**\\*This post is about physical silver, not the ETF's or futures contracts**\n\n**Hello SEC! Thank you for reading my due diligence on Silver. Please note I am not inciting a short squeeze I'm just telling people that I like SLV and why they should consider liking it too. I am not a financial advisor and we are all individuals acting of our own accord. If you want someone to investigate try investigating the hedge funds and corrupt brokers.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBefore GME gang downvotes:\n\nListen up this isn't r/GME this is r/wallstreetbets I know you have your battles to buy but we shouldn't miss out on SLV just because you guys like GME still. OF course dont sell GME to buy SLV just hold and wait for the squeeze but we must recognise that SLV is ACTUALLY a legit play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to check that i'm not a robot send me captchas and ill do them for you\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently there have been a few posts about SLV, but I tried to wait until the GME hypes has died down to post this. This DD will be split into two parts:\n\n1. Why SLV in on itself is a good and safe investment (Boomer DD)\n2. Why SLV has moon mission potential (WSB DD)\n\n**We should not miss the silver play just because we are currently in GME. You guys may not know this but its actually possible to hold more than one type of stock at the same time.**\n\n**The Boomer DD (Source: goldsilver.com)**\n\n*Why silver is a good investment*\n\nSilver cannot be created out of thin air. It cannot be printed.\n\nSilver has no counter-party risk. Physical silver does not rely on another party making good on their contract. Silver also outperforms Gold in bull markets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Gold vs Silver](https://preview.redd.it/bjnbtrtjpgf61.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&s=4536c7c77ab04631c9de08daf8caae9dc2c6ba11)\n\nGovernment inventories of silver are also falling. Since silver does have industrial uses, in the future these industrial demands will be difficult to meet. This is because governments no longer hold large stockpiles of silver due to the fact that they no longer need the silver to make coins.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8uf985knpgf61.png?width=1388&format=png&auto=webp&s=41c26d5a8d97396556e07a1c9b5d218660cac6da\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSilver use in industrial production is also increasing.\n\nThere is silver in cell phones, things like self heating windshields, as a catalyst for the production of plastics and chemicals etc.\n\nOne key use of silver is its use in photovoltaic cells, which is the main constituent of solar panels. So silver is also a solar energy play. With Biden taking office, we can expect more production of solar panels and thus an increase in demand for silver that governments cannot fulfil.\n\nPhotovoltaic cells are those little tiny cells that you see on solar panels.  Read more about it [here](https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/how-does-photovoltaic-cell-work)\n\nOn average, a solar panel uses about 20 grams of silver.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[China needs silver but can't get it](https://preview.redd.it/mx8ng1mppgf61.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=e28b940133f96c3c4934fbe3490cf557117ac5ec)\n\n*Silver supply is dropping*\n\nSilver prices crashed after it peaked in 2011. As silver dropped 72.1%, silver miners had to find ways to cut costs to keep turning profit. What they did was they dramatically decreased the amount of exploration and development for silver mines. As such, Silver production is in decline.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Chart for you](https://preview.redd.it/jd7j4f5tpgf61.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bf89b396074924c03685e65bcb4ae1556f7c90e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to conclude the boomer DD:\n\n\\- Inflation is on the rise\n\n\\- Too much money is being printed\n\n\\- Silver outperforms gold\n\n\\- Silver biggest use is industrial use\n\n\\- Silver demand is increasing\n\n\\- Silver supply is dropping\n\n**WSB DD 🚀🚀🚀🚀**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to [coingape.com](https://coingape.com) , in order to pull short squeeze of hedge funds (not necessarily JP Morgan), we would need silver to go to $500\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Some tweet they put on their site idk 🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/6dej6iowpgf61.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=e33a578db6f235c5e14b7d420637ce7936838b6d)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, I am in no way saying that we should short squeeze silver ( Hello SEC! )\n\nI'm just saying that I really like SLV stock, and you should consider it for the above boomer reasons. There is also an additional upside of the fact that IF for some reason many people bought the stock it would squeeze upwards infinitely. This is because unlike the GME short squeeze, where GME can issue new stock, a silver short squeeze could continue until they manage to mine more silver, because silver cannot be printed.\n\nAlso, we saw a lot of hedge funds trying to interfere with the GME short squeeze. Robinhood restricting bought GME shares, brokers being gay etc etc. The difference with silver is brokers do not control how much silver we can buy, and all the new people who just joined WSB in the daily discussion thread going \"Hey guys i'm a newbie can someone please tell me whether stocks are going up or down today and also how can I buy stock also which stock is going up the most today thank you\" can also join in. If a short squeeze were to happen, this is how it would happen.\n\n1. People buy SLV stock (not random ETF's because they don't buy physical silver)\n2. Silver price go up\n3. JP Morgan ANGRY\n4. Robinhood and other brokers experience \"temporary outages\", \"Buy button glitch where buy button disappears for some reason\" , \"Limiting SLV shares that can be bought\"\n5. WSB and noobs who don't know how to buy stock can just go outside and buy physical silver bars or coins. Or since we are in a pandemic order it off eBay or something\n\nBasically, the special thing about silver is that more cannot be printed and that buying it cant be restricted in any meaningful way.\n\nWhether or not large banks like JP Morgan are actually short silver is a different discussion that other people should write about because it's heavily debated and I don't know the answer, but what we can CONFIRM is that HEDGE FUNDS are short on silver.\n\nMaybe in the future first place will get a silver medal and second place will get gold\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Rebuttals against the bullish case on silver**\n\nI have been drafting this message for a while, and at the same time have skimmed a few anti-silver posts. The common points against this is\n\n\\- One contract is too expensive\n\n\\- People who don't know how to trade futures will get stuck with it\n\n\\- Its taking attention away from GME\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*One contract is too expensive*\n\nThe contracts you are referring to are the futures, aka paper silver. There are three ways to buy physical silver\n\n1. But silver futures and take delivery\n2. Buy SLV shares\n3. Buy Silver from jewellers or online sellers\n\nThere are currently around 5 times more contracts for silver in the COMEX markets than there is supply of it. This means that when you buy SLV futures and exercise it, the person who sold it to you would have to scramble to find someone who DOES have it. Once we do this, they will start to realise and register to complete lack of silver there is in the market. Companies like TSLA, Samsung and Canadian solar have been accumulating a silver stockpile, because they know that supply is dwindling. People have bought all the reasonably priced silver online too, if you don't believe me check for yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*People who don't know how to trade futures will get stuck with tonnes of silver and delivery fees*\n\nSee above\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Its taking attention away from GME*\n\nI am not being paid by anyone to write this, i just genuinely see the potential for it. While I do agree that GME is still relevant, it doesn't mean we cannot have other stocks in our portfolios. We shouldn't miss out on silver just because we are still in GME. Besides, a SLV squeeze would be much more beneficial than the GME squeeze because of my last point below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Last and most important point - the benefit of a silver price rise**\n\n**When GME prices go up, who benefits? Shareholders, hedge funds who are long GME, banks, etc**\n\n**When BITCOIN moons, who benefits? Banks, rich people, people who have the education and means to figure out how to buy it, people who have access to bitcoin wallets, brokers etc.**\n\n**When we blow up stocks like GME and BTC, even though we profit, and even if we bankrupt hedge funds, the money goes to other hedge funds or rich people who can afford the risk to own GME stock.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BUT WHO OWNS SILVER?**\n\nAlmost every household owns some silver. Whether its' bars, coins, or religious statues. Poorer countries and places, like Asia and Africa, most households have a small silver chain, a family heirloom, ornamental utensils or ornamental gourd bucket I don't know.\n\nIf silver prices moon, money goes to the people, even though yes some will go to rich people who are long on silver, silver is something that poor people are also shareholders of. If we can get silver back to its FAIR VALUE, through the reasons and HYPOTHETICAL methods I mentioned above, we can not only burn hedge funds, profit for ourselves, but also help poor families.\n\nPoor people don't how to set up a brokerage account and buy Gamestonk. Poor people don't know how to trade cryptocurrencies. Poor people don't have the capital to enter into the stock market. What they DO have is gold and silver (mainly silver).  When they don't have the knowledge or ability to buy shares (As proven with the recent influx of people with \"What is a broker\" kind of questions), they get left out of these massive wealth transfers. Its much easier to say \"Buy silver lol\" than \"Ok so open a brokerage account with a broker that does not block meme stocks and that suits your needs, verify all your information, deposit money and make sure the risk you take aligns with your risk tolerance and the amount you are willing to lose....\"\n\nIf you want to bankrupt hedge funds, don't transfer wealth from one hedge fund to other hedge funds who are long GME. Instead, transfer wealth from the hedge funds to the pockets of poor families.\n\nTLDR WSB DD: If silver goes back to its fair value then lots of poorer people will benefit from this along with you. Also silver buying cannot be restricted because you don't need a broker to buy silver. (IF YOU ARE READING THIS DITCH ROBINHOOD AND CHANGE BROKERS. IF YOU DON'T CHANGE BROKRS THEY WILL KEEP DOING THINGS LIKE THIS \\[When you don't pay for a product you ARE the product\\])\n\nRegardless or whether or not we take part, silver will get to its fair value. Although it would be faster if we joined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStocks I like: SLV\n\nStocks I DO NOT LIKE: silver ETF's that have paper silver positions\n\nIf you have questions, counterpoints, suggestions or edits message me u/Prestigious_West_524", "id": "lcfm96", "created_utc": 1612445277.0, "score": 59, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "SLV is a great play.

{"title": "Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW) - Stock poised for breakout, and is relatively unknown, but certainty worth your time looking into with multiple catalysts for earnings this month.", "selftext": "Hello Fellow Autists, I have an opportunity I wish to present to you that. \n\nThe company is Atlas Air (AAWW).  This article is an earnings play on a strong company that is not in mainstream media. If you wanna get straight to the point, just go to the end of this write up. \n\nAtlas Air Worldwide is a leader in global airfreight, that serves freight, commercial, charter, and military customers. If you ever had an iPhone or PlayStation 3-5, or watched a San Diego Chargers game you've probably been impacted by Atlas Air. They have a combination of an efficient fleet, cost-saving operations, and superior customer service. With nearly 3,600 employees working across 90 countries, Atlas Air generated 2019 net sales of $2.74 billion.\n\nThey provide ACMI (Aircraft, Crew, Maintenance, and Insurance), whereby they provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions, including the provision of an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance, while customers assume fuel, demand and price risk. In addition, customers are generally responsible for landing, navigation and most other operational fees and costs;.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Flying our tendies as you read this](https://preview.redd.it/2couglpv6hf61.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=cddd29a8ec3d6c527bbfc8ec8b32226525a58251)\n\nThe company recently strengthened and diversified its business and fleet with a focus on serving express and e-commerce, which has positioned it well to handle the increased demand in online orders and the future distribution of vaccines.  In the third quarter, management saw strong demand for their long-haul wide-body services. The company anticipates solid volumes in the fourth quarter, driven by continued e-commerce growth. They recently made a deal with Alibaba (BABA) to send their consumer's merchandise to South America and allowing them to grow operations there.\n\nThe stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 7.69. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 15.53. Their biggest competitor is Air Transport Services group (ATSG) who even though has a bigger market cap, higher P/E ratio of 15.97, also happens to have a smaller fleet then Atlas Air and does not have the 747-800 which is the newest model of the 747 and most fuel efficient while carrying more weight which in this industry is crucial and helps them stand out from their competitors.\n\nThey just bought 4 more 747s to add to their fleet. \n\nA resistance level has formed in the chart of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc.  If this level is crossed, a breakout could occur and has been at the same levels since November.\n\nAAWW saw strong earnings and revenue growth in the third quarter with earnings up 667.6% year over year and revenue up 24.9%. The stock is trading at a low valuation with a Price to Sales ratio of 0.5 and a Price to Book ratio of 0.7.\n\nThe company’s cash position for the third quarter was $718 million, up from $72 million in the same quarter last year. Though that is considerably lower than its long-term debt of $2.4 Billion. AAWW has shown strong long-term momentum, but is down over the short-term.\n\n**There are multiple catalysts that could cause this stock to break out.**\n\nThe first one is the fact that the company is being apart of the vaccine distribution and is expected for the next year to help distribute the vaccine because their aircraft can support and hold the refrigerators to carry the vaccines since they have to be kept cold.\n\nSecond catalyst. Atlas Air has a partnership with amazon where amazon leases their fleet to transport all their shit all over the world. With the epidemic and amazon growing like crazy this has only lead Atlas Air to grow. Amazon has warrants to buy up to 23% of the company by end of 2023. And its Christmas and I have a feeling Christmas records for Amazon are about to be shattered which means Atlas Air will be busy. Also typically around Christmas through February is the company's busiest time of the year even without\n\nThird catalyst. Growth. Atlas Air is adding to its fleet (Just bought 4 more 747s) and is hiring more pilots to tackle the tasks at hand. Also passenger airlines typically when doing international trips hold additional cargo in their hull to make more profits, but with less international flights due to Covid Atlas Air has had growth in customers asking them to hull freight. And assuming Atlas Air does good with these customers and makes them happy their clientele should expect to grow.\n\nForth catalyst. Gasoline is pretty cheap, even though it is rising in price with vaccine news, it is still much cheaper then previously before for aircraft.\n\nFifth Catalyst maybe? As the coronavirus chaos is beginning to come to an end and super sexy overvalued tech companies are no longer as attractive this can lead to an emphasis on value and funds will be longer for their next growth prospects and this provides opportunity for value and growth and a way to capitalize off the coronavirus vaccine, amazon holiday season, and a ever changing world.\n\nSixth catalyst if you go into long term calls....every time there is a war Atlas air booms because the military hires them to fly out to the middle east and shit is stirring up in the Middle East right now.\n\n**Passenger Airlines are responsible for 40% of air freight before covid...imagine what the earnings report will look like after this busy holiday season.** \n\nTo summarize, this is a well ran growing company and the stock price is poised for a breakout with a combination of these catalysts. The company is no where near its all time high yet it is the best it has ever been financially. The company is also owned over 90% by institutional investors so there is lots of smart money in the company who recognize value and the next earnings report is this month on the 18th and this company tends to have a run up towards earnings.\n\nLiterally Can't go tits up. 🚀🚀✈️✈️🌚🌚\n\nDon’t roast my shit for this not being a GME or AMC post\n\nPositions\n\n\\-55 3/15 Calls\n\n\\-57.50 5/21 Calls\n\nSources and more information about the company and industry:\n\n[https://www.aircargonews.net/business/airfreight-rates/airfreight-rates-remain-elevated-in-january-despite-seasonal-slowdown/](https://www.aircargonews.net/business/airfreight-rates/airfreight-rates-remain-elevated-in-january-despite-seasonal-slowdown/)\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-value-investors-buy-atlas-air-worldwide-aaww-stock-2020-12-14](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/should-value-investors-buy-atlas-air-worldwide-aaww-stock-2020-12-14)\n\n[https://seekingalpha.com/article/4399523-atlas-air-worldwide-is-compelling](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4399523-atlas-air-worldwide-is-compelling)", "id": "lchjnt", "created_utc": 1612451080.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Solid DD.

They're in phase 3 trials of their covid vaccine right now and have been signing deals left and right, such as:\n\n[https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/03/gsk-joins-forces-with-curevac-to-manufacture-its-covid-19-vaccine-and-to-develop-another/](https://www.statnews.com/2021/02/03/gsk-joins-forces-with-curevac-to-manufacture-its-covid-19-vaccine-and-to-develop-another/)\n\n[https://www.media.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/Bayer-to-manufacture-mRNA-vaccine-in-Germany](https://www.media.bayer.com/baynews/baynews.nsf/id/Bayer-to-manufacture-mRNA-vaccine-in-Germany)\n\n[https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-82224.html](https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/media-releases.msg-id-82224.html)\n\nI'm expecting phase 3 trial results from them early next month, mostly based on this, which has the trial set to conclude on March 4th or 5th:\n\n[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04652102](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04652102)\n\nThis is earlier than I expected, due to the trials being initiated on December 22nd to my knowledge, but maybe it's accurate?  Anyways, if any of you have followed Novavax ($NVAX), their stock price went to the moon a few days ago when they announced that their vaccine worked, and I'm anticipating a similar large move in $CVAC if their vaccine works.  From what I've read about their phase 1 and 2 results, and seeing large deals being signed each week now for distribution, I'm expecting phase 3 results to show that the vaccine works.\n\nNow there is a counterargument to this, mainly that they already have a higher market cap than $NVAX, will be able to produce less of their vaccine, and their vaccine will have most likely have lower efficacy than $NVAX: [https://twitter.com/MedResCol/status/1355489429150986240](https://twitter.com/MedResCol/status/1355489429150986240).  Also obviously their vaccine might not work, but I don't think this is likely.\n\nHowever, I am of the belief that they will exceed these delivery numbers and may engage in more partnerships to produce their vaccine candidate once it is proven to be effective.\n\nAdditionally, DADDY MUSK is in their corner, with Tesla having partnered with CureVac to develop mRNA printers capable of printing multiple different vaccines: [https://electrek.co/2020/07/03/tesla-joint-patent-curevac-revolutionary-bioreactor-for-rna/](https://electrek.co/2020/07/03/tesla-joint-patent-curevac-revolutionary-bioreactor-for-rna/)\n\nWhen their phase 3 trial results are published and they shoot up like $NVAX printing tendies for all you're gonna be salty you didn't get in on that sweet action.\n\nPositions: I hold calls for March 21 as well as shares, if you wanna be safer with guessing when their phase 3 results will be out maybe go for April 21 calls.  I'm poor so I don't have that many calls or shares, and I also lose money a lot so maybe this DD sucks.

Much of the EU is still signing deals for vaccine dosages, and I think they'll likely make more production partnerships in the next few months, especially after phase 3 trials conclude.  Some of these might be for 2022 dosages, but they seem to be finding new partners for producing their vaccine at a faster rate in the past few months.\n\nEdit: the RNA microfactories could significantly ramp up their production capacity if they can get them working as well, but from statements they've made, these aren't being used to produce their current vaccine, and I wouldn't expect them to be working until at least 2022.\n\nThis is more a momentum play based on what I think is the likelihood of their vaccine candidate succeeding in phase 3 and rocketing upwards similar to Novavax.  I don't really see them going downwards after a successful phase 3 vaccine trial anyways, and I expect the results to show that their vaccine candidate works.

HOWEVER, the rookie fighter learns the professional boxer just became blind on his right eye (OVERSHORTING SHARES). The rookie boxer uses that information to his advantage to attack the pro boxer from the right side, giving the rookie and advantage. THIS IS ALL LEGAL!

This will inevitably create a crash in price. The moment the price crashed they lifted the limitations. It was black and white what they were doing.\n\n**On top of this**, right as this event was in full swing a wide range of articles and new channels started promoting how social media has moved on from GME to focus on SLV (Really!??)... nobody was focusing on silver. The price of silver was driven up buy the hedge funds pre market and immediately started declining again while the news continued to emphasis the end of the GME squeeze (which wasnt over, it was blocked from happening) all the while dribbling on about the SLV craze (that didnt exist). Coincidentally the hedge funds involved in the GME situation also happen to profit highly from the SLV hype that was created.\n\n**And last but not least**, there was (and still is) clear evidence that hedge funds have been continuously trading GME back and forth all week at lower and lower prices to artificially drive down the price and cause retail investors to lose interest in GME (...or essentially give up).\n\nWhat’s happening now is theft in broad day light. The hedge funds are acting like the spoiled kid at a park who takes his ball and leaves because hes losing at the game. The moment it wasnt working for the hedge funds the illusion of free market was popped.\n\nReality is that we retail investors get screwed every day by front running, shorting and HFT. That is the bigger theft. This is just a more visible theft, because Wall St. nearly failed.\n\nAlso, they still might fail. I'm still buying GME with my money.\n\nIf I lose it, I lose it.

I want to just take a moment to talk about the negativity being thrown around and the potential mental health crisis that could unfold for many people here.\n\nI know the general sentiment is to shit on all the people with negativity about \"You're a fucking idiot, you should've sold when you had the chance\", etc but I understand why some of them feel that way, despite the fact that some may be shills / bots. But I want to remind the people (who are not bots / shills) that you could be exasperating some serious inner self-turmoil for many people based on these words causing their mental health to be in ruins.\n\nIn these times, we have to help these people up and give them good advice without sounding like jackasses. Have some damn humility and read the whole thread before downvoting.\n\n# My Perspective about Holding - Hindsight 20/20\n\nMaybe naive of me to say but I'd rather die knowing I follow through with what I say rather than folding to the guys laughing down at us. Go out with some damn dignity if you're going to go out at all. Whether the squeeze happens or not, I'd rather just hold and hope GME does better as a company in the future. If not, then it was money I was already prepared to lose. It's really that simple. **BUT ONLY... if you put in the money that you could afford.**\n\nThe point is, it wasn't completely stupid to get involved because truly, hindsight is 20/20 for situations like this. This was an unprecedented event in the likes the world has literally never seen. How could you possibly have predicted it to the tee? You can't pretend like you're a smartass that saw all this coming. You can only extrapolate the data as it comes and watch as the event unfolds.\n\nI'd say you can call it more of a gamble than an investment, but it doesn't take a genius to understand that when getting in. The fact is, expectations should have been set better for all the new people that joined.\n\nLike I said earlier, the only people to worry about are the ones who truly have lost a majority of their wealth from this. I'm all about diamond hands but realistically if I invested at the starting price before it spiked to $400, I probably would've sold enough to cover my initial investment and kept the rest to be a part of the movement.\n\n# Some Lives Have Been Destroyed... Let's not deny it\n\nI know there may still be potential, heck I'm still diamond hands - but there are some people here that really went all out. Like I don't know if you've been paying attention, but I've seen it on blogs, on this subreddit, on social media. Some people really have gone ALL OUT or have thrown a majority of their wealth on this.\n\nIf this is the case, I'd start talking to a financial advisor immediately about what your next steps are. My deepest sympathies go out to the guys and gals who are feeling breathless and suffocated in these times, that in it of itself has been giving me more anxiety than anything else. Just looking at all the people who put in way more than they could chew... it honestly destroys me. I have anxiety myself and I can't imagine what you people are going through right now.\n\nI can see people killing themselves over the decisions that have been made in the past 2 weeks. Especially with the pandemic at an all time high and already causing mental health ruin, this does not help.\n\nFor the people that feel destroyed - you are going to get through this. I know it fucking sucks but you will. Life can change at an instant at any second the same way it can go to shit. The same way you feel you're never going to find that person to fall in love with and the next second some gorgeous girl is going out with your ugly ass. In either case, little by little, you'll fix this and you'll have become stronger for it.\n\n**Upside and Lessons**\n\nOn the flip side, I and I'm sure many have had and are having a lot fun being a part of this movement and still holding til the end. It's not over til the damn thing hits 0. Apes together strong and all that shit - but I hope this was a valuable lesson to many who had thrown everything in to not let emotions get in the way of making smart investment decisions.\n\nThis was a volatile market, and should have come in understanding that this was basically gambling money as much as it was an attempt at a short-term investment. Going forward, if you decide to stick around and invest in the stock market in general, it really can be an enjoyable experience to play with the numbers in a way that doesn't get your heart dropping every 2 seconds.\n\nIf any of you need to talk or are feeling low, the PMs are open, and I'm sure there are many dumb apes (apes have hearts right?) that can and will help you get through this.\n\n**Closing thoughts... It's not over so don't just give up yet -  hold strong if you can afford to stay in the fight and put food on the table. We're in this together til the end!**\n\nEdit: For some reason, I see comments being deleted for no reason - not sure what that's about.", "id": "lcreds", "created_utc": 1612475973.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "Holding isn't a three day, one week deal, either. Stock marketing isn't often  a short term game, I think that's forgotten in the chaos both by the discouraged and the defeatists.\n\nIt's not even halfway through Feb, maybe a week, maybe two into this and we're already hand wringing? This isn't a roulette spinning, one armed bandit where you get one shot to win kind of casino. This is certainly a combination of knowledge, luck, and most importantly, patience. \n\nSome people have chosen to gamble with more than can afford, you live, you learn. Losing money isn't that big of a deal and it can be recovered from. You haven't fundamentally changed who you are. Even if you're rendered totally homeless it's something you can recover from. (I've been there, so I know you can get out of that hole) \n\nIf high risk behavior is something routine, if the low in this short term pushes you to drown in depression or self destructive behaviors, seek help. (If you need to emotionally beat up others online, you need help too, just sayin')There are a large number of mental health resources out there (Google is your friend!) and there is zero shame in getting that help. \n\nAt the end of the day, take care of yourself and your own. Talk to someone if you need to. Smoke up, have some tendies in front of a comedy movie or video game.
