{"title": "The BBBY Short Squeeze (Little Sister of All Short Squeezes)", "selftext": "**TLDR**: BBBY Rocket Ship Emoji, Calls (3/19 25-35cs) and Shares\n\nFirst, I like to reiterate my own retarded investing tenets to make sure any plays I make align with it: \n\nOverall:\n\n1. I'm a retard and don't know anything.\n\nBull Market specific tenets (if you're a gay bear move on):\n\n1. The market is undervalued, and \n\n2. Small businesses are getting crushed by governments to the benefit of big business, due to COVID.\n\nWhat's that mean? Sure, stocks may be overvalued, but the entire market is UNDERvalued, so your own internal stock valuations don't mean shit. Ask yourself, \"where the fuck else would I put my money?\" If you put it in a bank, printer goes BRRRR and you lose value. The only option is real assets: equities, real estate, and then to a lesser extent guns/ammo/food.\n\nSo this play, a boomer ass retail chain, sounds dumb as hell when I say it. That means it MUST be good. It's a big business, which our government is bending over backwards to give free money to. Big stores have cash on hand, which smaller businesses it competes with don't. It has an online presence. Online presence sounds useless, except COVID is forcing the move to online quicker than even the most skilled executive could pivot those old store-based retail ships. And COVID/WFH means they get to drop their unprofitable stores, employee benefits, and dead weight faster without any blow back from consumers.\n\nAll of this is even BEFORE I look at [BBBY specifically](https://bedbathandbeyond.gcs-web.com/financial-information/sec-filings). Let's get into it:\n\n* BBBY has cash on hand, $1.5B to be exact (+$0.5B since COVID began. See? What did I say?)\n\n* They grew online sales by 77%, with over a third of them through in store deliveries (aka, customers in stores. If you're tarded, that means good).\n\n* Margins are going up +3.1% (another side effect of COVID, less costs). They also STARTED to cut and streamline their inventory which hasn't even fully been taken into effect yet, since it takes months if not years to liquidate their old junk, but the costs are coming down there.\n\n* Most importantly, the people. They hired Target exec Mark Tritton as their CEO and he's been doing really well pivoting them online, just like he did with Target (What do you think of when you think of Amazon competitors? Wal Mart and Target). He also brought a ton of improved private brands to BBBY, and if you're a retard like me, private brands = margin (that means money).  Sure, he's not Ryan Cohen, but [he's no slouch](https://www.retaildive.com/news/one-year-in-mark-trittons-turnaround-at-bed-bath-beyond/587680/).\n\nFinally, this is one of the highest shortest stocks on the market, at [61.2%](https://www.highshortinterest.com/) and INCREASING.\n\nSo let's recap so far:\n\n* New Exec with a proven track record.\n\n* An actual profitable business and online presence.\n\n* Tailwinds (gov and economic) pushing them to profitability (not even including their smaller inventory + private brands growth).\n\n* Shorted out the ass.\n\nSound like GME? Nope, it's BBBY. It's not going to be like GME's almost infinity squeeze (praise be to DFV), but it could be the LITTLE SISTER OF ALL SHORT SQUEEZES.\n\n**BBBY 3/19 $25-35c rocket ship emoji etc. etc.**", "id": "kxn8it", "created_utc": 1610685873.0, "score": 109, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "I'm with ya, holding shares", "score": 20, "replies": []}, {"body": "I love this store and their 20% coupons that never expire.

{"title": "Market correction, dollar rising - episode 4.", "selftext": "Anyone who has been following these posts since last week can see that my correction thesis is starting to bear fruit today. Opex dates are notorious for starting more substantial (5-10%) correction periods in the market. It‚Äôs no surprise that today is opex and that the market is selling off. \n\nThose of us shorting this market now need to see follow through selling. Dip buyers are going to show up because they have been rewarded for doing so on every dip since last October. If the bearish crab pattern I‚Äôve previously posted is going to play out we need to see at least 2-3 more days in a row of selling to get some confirmation that a real 4-8 week correction in the markets are going to take place. \n\nAs I‚Äôve also previously stated, I don‚Äôt think this is the beginning of a new bear market. For that to happen I would need to see some very key technical levels broken. Until that happens, I view this as just a potential cool off period before the bull market continues. \n\nSo, moving forward there are two things I want to see to confirm this is more than just a little wimpy 1 day correction.\n\n1. - Today I want to see the SP500 close at the lows of the day with high volume selling into the close. \n\n2. When the markets come back next Tuesday after a long weekend I want to see another big red day. \n\nIf those two things happen then I will be adding to my short positions on any bounce that is likely to follow sometime next week. \n\nGood luck out there üåàüêª‚Äôs", "id": "ky024f", "created_utc": 1610733915.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.35, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "Nasdaq is going to rise 10-12% next week", "score": 22, "replies": []}, {"body": "Another post about the ‚Äúbearish crab pattern‚Äù.
