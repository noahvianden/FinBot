Biden said Friday the total will be in “the trillions of dollars.” The election Tuesday of two Georgia Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, shifted control of the Senate to Democrats.\n*****\n> While disturbing, the temporary assault on the Capitol Building did not ruffle markets, and the removal of Trump is not expected to receive enough Republican support to succeed with just days remaining in his term. Biden is scheduled to be sworn in on Jan. 20.\n*****\n> “The market is willing to look through that chaos, but not through this anticipation of faster and bigger stimulus,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.\n*****\n> # Earnings, data ahead\nIn the normal business of markets, fourth-quarter earnings season begins with the rollout of big banks’ reports Friday, when JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo on tap. There is also a long list of Fed speakers including Chairman Jerome Powell, who is scheduled for a webcast from Princeton University Thursday.\n*****\n> On the data front, CPI inflation data is released Wednesday and December’s retail sales are reported Friday.\n*****\n> The consumer price index will be important, and although it is expected to show muted inflation, markets have begun to price in rising expectations in the bond market. One bond market inflation measure, the 10-year breakeven, went as high as 2.1% Thursday, meaning investors expect that to be the average level of inflation over the next 10 years.\n*****\n> But strategists said little will matter but stimulus, which economists expect will ease the impact of the surging virus on the economy. The U.S. reported more than 4,000 deaths from Covid in one day for the first time Friday.\n*****\n> The stock market may also begin to pause as soon as the coming week, as the virus surge continues and investors worry vaccines are being too slowly deployed,\n*****\n> “You feel like this recovery rally is going to run out of legs,” Hogan said. He said that with the S&P 500 up about 16% since Nov. 4, investors may begin to think it is getting ahead of itself.\n*****\n> “That could be next week’s business to contemplate. You’re likely to take some sort of breather,” Hogan said.\n*****\n> Tom Lee, founder of Fundstrat, said there’s a level on the S&P 500 that could be a turning point for the market. The S&P 500 closed at 3,824 Friday, up 18% for the week.\n*****\n> “I think there’s a chance we could be hitting 3,900 and that’s a key level for markets,” said Lee. “That’s the level where people are looking for a local top. That’s a level where we could be repelled. It’s a number where if we blast through it, it would be good but if we don’t break through it, it could start the correction. It’s a binary risk.”\n*****\n> But even if there is a pullback, Lee expects the S&P 500 to reach 4,300 by year end. “I think what the stock market is saying is we’re going to get a really good economy this year,” he said.\n*****\n> Earnings season should be a positive for stocks.\n*****\n> “Uncertainty has plagued everyone, so the certainty that comes with earnings is good for stocks,” said Lee.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/C0LIthO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/naBACT7.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/3qF2U4y.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/mRvY2KC.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WfEELCq.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bUvCcqT.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/99vHejZ.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ABV4hoR.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/fuVlrhi.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OWCbndT.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/PrdtNkQ8/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/sfYjV27r/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/hv1cMCcj/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Cyclicals Climb, Defensives Decline\n\n> As we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot, cyclical sectors are leading the way higher in 2021 as Energy, Materials, and Financials are all up around 5% or more compared to the S&P 500's gain of a more modest 1.65% YTD. That outperformance has led to some sharp moves in the relative strength lines of several sectors. As shown below, the Materials sector and Financials have both seen sharp moves higher in their relative strength lines versus the S&P 500. For Materials, this has been part of a broader trend of outperformance (upward trending line) that has been in place over the past year. For Financials, prior to this most recent upswing, the line first began to trend higher in the late Fall but then took some pause in December. Meanwhile, Consumer Discretionary, Energy, Health Care, and Industrials have also made moves higher, albeit more modest than those of Materials and Financials.\n\n> As for the other sectors' relative strength lines, there have been some sharp moves in the opposite direction. Starting with what had been market leaders at various points of the past year, Communication Services and Technology are perhaps some of the most notable negative reversals. For the former, the relative strength line has generally moved sideways over the past year, but since mid-December, the line has been on the decline with one of the most dramatic legs lower taking place in the past week. Tech was a consistent outperformer in the first half of 2020, but since the summer that outperformance has faltered. The sector's relative strength line peaked and has been trending sideways since the start of September and the move so far in 2021 has brought the line down towards the low end of the past few months' range. As for other sectors, Real Estate, Utilities, and Consumer Staples have been trending lower for the better portion of the past year, but with cyclical sectors flying, the relative strength lines of these more defensive sectors have made new lows this week in dramatic fashion.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/010821-RS.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Sector Breadth Strong\n\n> Several measures of market breadth have been showing strength recently as we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot. Over 80% of S&P 500 stocks trade above their 50-DMAs, more than half are overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA), and over 20% of S&P 500 stocks reached new 52-week highs yesterday. Additionally, shorter-term breadth as measured by the 10-day advance-decline line has also been strong. Pretty much across the board, every sector's 10-day A/D line has tipped into overbought levels. That doesn't apply to only Consumer Staples and Real Estate which have more modest readings, though breadth for these sectors has still been positive recently. At the moment, Materials, Health Care, and Financials are the most overbought sectors by this measure. Overall, the sharp moves higher in the 10-day A/D lines does flash a warning sign for the very near term that things are running a bit hot.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/010821-10-day-AD.png))**\n\n> As previously mentioned, several sectors are reaching new 52-week highs, and given breadth has been strong to match, cumulative advance-decline lines are confirming the moves higher. As shown in the charts below, Consumer Discretionary, Health Care, Industrials, Materials, as well as the broader S&P 500 all closed at 52-week highs last week and so too did those sectors’ cumulative A/D lines. While price did not close at new highs, Tech, Financials, and Communication Services also all saw new highs in their cumulative AD lines.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/010821-cumulative-breadth.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Stocks Off to Strong Start to 2021\n\n> The average stock in the Russell 3,000 is already up 5.24% year-to-date after just four trading days. And to think, major indices were down ~1% on the first trading day of the year this past Monday. Below we highlight the average YTD performance of stocks by sector in the Russell 3,000. Remember, the Russell 3,000 contains large-caps, mid-caps, and small-caps, and it covers roughly 98.5% of all US-traded market cap. As shown, Energy stocks have jumped out to the strongest start to the year with an average gain of 13.26%. Materials rank second with a gain of 9.1%, and then Industrials, Financials, Health Care, and Consumer Discretionary are all bunched together with gains between 5% and 6%. Technology stocks -- last year's big leaders -- are 'only' up 4.34% on average so far in 2021, while the Real Estate sector is the only one that has averaged declines.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/sectorsavg.png))**\n\n> Looking at Industry Groups, while Technology as a whole is underperforming a bit, the Semiconductor group (which are part of the Tech sector) is up big with average YTD gains of 9.4%. Autos are also performing very well with a gain of 9.2%. Thank you Tesla (TSLA).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/r3kgroups.png))**\n\n> There are already more than 600 stocks in the Russell 3,000 that are up more than 10% year-to-date. That represents 20% of the index.\n\n> Below is a look at the top-performing stocks so far in 2021. Usually, it takes weeks or months to see YTD gains like these, but we've gotten here in just four trading days. 3D Systems (DDD) ranks first with a gain of 119%, followed by Atomera (ATOM) at 70%, ViewRay (VRAY) at 59.5%, Arcturus (ARCT) at 54%, and Akerna (KERN) at 52%. We don't fault you if you have never heard of these names!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/beststocksytd.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Equity Winners and Losers in 2020\n\n> 2020 was a good year for stock investors despite unprecedented challenges.\n\n> After being down more than 30% at the March 2020 lows, the S&P 500 Index ended the year with a solid 18.4% total return. Last year marked the first time the index ended a year positive after being down at least 30% during that year. Gains were driven primarily by the emerging economic recovery taking hold, bolstered by massive stimulus, and the remarkably fast COVID-19 vaccine development that encouraged market participants to begin to price in the end of the pandemic.\n\n> We take a look at some of the asset class and sector winners and losers in 2020.\n\n> Massive growth outperformance. The growth style of investing had one of its biggest runs ever relative to the value style in 2020, benefiting from better positioning for the pandemic, superior earnings growth, and balance sheet strength. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the major growth indexes returned over 30% while the value indexes produced mid-single-digit gains. The technology sector was the biggest driver of growth outperformance (about 60% of it), but the consumer discretionary sector—led by Amazon, one of the biggest stay-at-home stocks—also outperformed the broad markets and value indexes by a wide margin last year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.7.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Typical January Trading: Mixed Results since 2000\n\n> Today’s mixed market performance with mega-cap tech shares declining while other major indexes moving higher is not unusual behavior during January in recent years. The only difference is it has usually been tech moving higher while other areas of the market retreated. Since 2000, the S&P 500 has declined eleven times in twenty-one years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.\n\n> Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have all started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the end of the month. Weakness has historically accelerated just after mid-month, around the eleventh trading day.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a0a002cdd46e852712841fbd1688c132/24a9987a98ef15dd-ec/s500x750/ba4983415f1eddedf6687d8d793c86b9c732f497.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 8th, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6xqhdHaoXUw))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.10.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D38Z4N7eG1M))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$TSM** \n> * **$JPM** \n> * **$APHA** \n> * **$BLK** \n> * **$WFC** \n> * **$C** \n> * **$CMC** \n> * **$ACI** \n> * **$AZZ** \n> * **$DAL** \n> * **$INFY** \n> * **$KBH** \n> * **$SNX** \n> * **$PNC** \n> * **$SJR** \n> * **$OGI** \n> * **$SLP** \n> * **$LMNR** \n> * **$FRC** \n> * **$INFO** \n> * **$EXPO** \n> * **$BBCP** \n> * **$PRGS** \n> * **$KRUS** \n> * **$WAFD** \n> * **$WIT** \n> * **$VOLT**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/fuVlrhi.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/L8eQcWP.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 1.11.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WjsRkdd.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 1.11.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/qrT91FG.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  1.12.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/O2aSUyP.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 1.12.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mitgWeG.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 1.13.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xWZfXGx.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 1.13.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vplnuuc.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 1.14.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/oCqgrUS.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 1.14.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/qKlnVyr.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 1.15.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/mfw4byl.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 1.15.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited $118.69\n**Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (TSM)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 6:00 AM ET on Thursday, January 14, 2021.

{"title": "Buying safe dividend stocks on 1.59% margin - Free money? (long)", "selftext": "Trying to bounce some ideas/strategies around, especially for those that have tried them or see pros/cons with them.  \n\nOne of the ideas I've had is going with Interactive Brokers as they currently charge only 1.59% for margin loans.  With the government basically pledging to keep rates low for the upcoming years, how is it not a bad idea to buy 'safe' dividend paying stocks that pay 3-4% yield?  For example, Kellogg's or General Mills. They pay \\~ 3.7% each.  Lop 25% off for taxes, and you're left with a 2.75% gain.  Subtract out the 1.59% margin rate and you're looking at approximately a 1.15% profit.  Even Coke pays a 3.25% yield, and they've paid a dividend for over 120 years and have increased it every year for the past 55-60 years.  Had I known about IB and their insanely low margin rates during the pandemic, I probably would've loaded up on some high-quality stocks and gotten 5%+ yields AND made a boatload of money simply due to the share price going up.  So if I had decided to hold onto those gains for just 6 months, I would've only paid 0.8% for the loan.\n\nI understand 1.15% isn't much, as they could raise margin rates OR the share price could decrease by 1.15% or more (within minutes, technically)  However, these are stable stocks.  Both K/GIS are right at the midpoint of their 52-wk range.  If they went down, you could hold for a while and collect the dividend, waiting for the share price to increase.  If they end up going up, well, you can simply sell and book a profit -- especially if it's for a lot more than 1.15%.  Since I plan on holding for the longer term, I'm also interested in buying quality stocks right before they release their earnings.  If it's a good earning report, the stock will go up that day and I'll probably make a lot more than 1.15% profit in that day alone.  If the stock goes down, no biggie.  I'll hold it for the next 3, 6, 9 months -- whatever.  Maybe even a year or more.  Statistically, it'll go back up and I'll walk away with a gain.  \n\nSo that was the 'safe' stock angle.  I'm also interested in the angle of high-yield stocks, such as Horizon Technology Finance (HRZN), HTGC or TPVG.  HRNZ has typically paid \\~10% annual yields (paid monthly), and have done so for \\~ the past 10 years.  That's their business strategy; they a 'venture debt/business development company.'  They selectively provide loans to start-ups and have relatively stable income to support their payouts.  When you compare stocks that don't pay dividends to ones that pay high dividends, you see a stark contrast in their share prices over the years.  Typically companies that don't pay dividends see (hope) their share price goes up and up and up.  Think MSFT.   \n Companies that pay a lot in dividends see their share price go up very slowly over time (think: VZ & ATT)  And since these 'venture debt' companies pay out even higher dividends than higher-yield dividend stocks, their share price ends up staying relatively flat over the years as a higher level of cash is flowing out of the company on a regular basis.  If I started borrowing on margin, I'd only make these BDC companies a smaller part of my investment; less than 10%  \n\nNow another wrinkle to all this:  I currently have $110k in paper gains, and I've been selling as the stocks keep going up.  If things start going south, in the markets, I anticipate I'd book at least $75k gains (stop losses) So part of my investing angle is kinda to gamble; if I have a 50/50 of buying right before earnings, I may end up with a decrease in share price right off the bat.  I could sell my position at a loss OR I could ride it out.  Let's say I ride it out for 9 months and get show a $5k loss on 1 stock, but I've pulled in $2k in dividends.  The cookie jar is short by $3k, but I can sell that $5k loss and use it to off-set my big 2021 gains.  No, I'm not saying I'm trying to lose money, but if I have losses, then I can use them to off-set gains and pay lower taxes as a result.\n\nSo what is the real downside to this strategy?  Obviously a 'margin call' but I'm not talking about going all-in.  TIA for your ideas & input.  \n\nTLDR; talk me out of using super-cheap margin to buy stocks that pay good dividends.", "id": "ktki0h", "created_utc": 1610169001.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": ".. works while it works, what if they stop/cancel/reduce the dividend.

Overall IB is pretty small potatoes compared to Schwab or Fidelity, which is why they didn't really pop up on my radar until recently.  I always thought margin was 6-9% or so, and was where brokers made their money.  But according to my research, IB has historically catered to professionals/fund managers/day traders.  They have 2 types of accounts; Pro & Lite.  Lite caters to the Robinhood crowd and Pro caters to the pros.  Pro charges 1/2 cent per share, so pro traders are more likely to trade more expensive stocks like AMZN and not the cheap $5 stocks.  Lite doesn't charge fees per share.  So they make a ton of money on Pro accounts and other fees, which allows them to give out cheap margin.  Then when people are borrowing even more margin, IB makes more 1/2 cent commissions on each share.  Since they cater to professionals and traders, those types can even get a lot more leverage, which allows them to trade even more, which allows IB to make even more on commissions.  It's kinda like the reverse of a 'death spiral' for IB, ha.  I think the average margin account can leverage up to 4x and the pros can leverage 6-9x.  So tons of commissions to be made.
