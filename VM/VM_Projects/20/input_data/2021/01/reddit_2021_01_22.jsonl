{"title": "Journey to $1 Million - January 21, 2021", "selftext": " Today my portfolio is up 9%, or $58,000. Honestly, the markets, especially tech, have been pumping a lot for a while now. I'm expecting somewhat of a pull back tomorrow.\n\nThere have been two major cool offs from the post-covid19 run up, and there will be another. It seems like we are overdue. I am not saying everyone panic at once, but if you want to protect your portfolio from loss - and/or buy a future dip buy $UVXY (an inverse 1.5x of $SPY). This will hedge your portfolio until a dip occurs and you can then buy the dip. Doing this instead of selling your positions is more tax efficient because you aren't selling and won't pay income tax on your long term gains. It is something to consider if you are a long term HODLER of stocks and ETFs.\n\n**Adding to the Watchlist**\n\n**$CAT -** Caterpillar is a manufacturer of mining and construction vehicles you are probably familiar with. Now, you might be thinking why should I buy this stock? Simple. they have been developing autonomous vehicles and technology since before Tesla was. They started in 1985 and had two trucks by the early 1990s. CAT is the true \"OG\" of autonomy. Currently, they have many trucks and mining vehicles that are totally self driving and can easily navigate the terrain of a quarry or mine. For me this is an easy buy, that I can see myself holding mid term. CAT is a well established company that is a leader in their industry and has an autonomy technology that many people tend to look over during a period of boom in the EV and autonomous vehicle industry. CAT is up more than 100% since the Covid lows of March. Currently it is pulling back a little. I expect it to pull back a little more before continuing its upwards push towards $225. For $CAT I'm mostly interest in buying Calls.\n\n* Price Target - $225\n* Entry - Less than $187\n* Risk (1 out of 5) - 3\n* Timeframe - 2-4 months\n\n**$SBE** \\- Switchback energy is an interesting SPAC that is looking to merge with Chargepoint. They have already announced the merger, so besides an unforeseen circumstance, this should be an excellent play. Currently it is hitting resistance on a trendline.\n\n* Price Target - $50\n* Entry - $40 or less\n* Risk (1 out of 5) - 4\n* Timeframe - 2-4 weeks\n\n**$XPEV** \\- Xiao Peng is an EV manufacturer based in Southern China that is currently ahead of its domestic competition in autonomous driving. In Shenzhen, China, XPeng sedans are already on the street being tested and used for self driving. Unlike $NIO which in my opinion is over valued. I've seen Xpeng vehicles in person - they are nice. Also, in China they are marketing harder than NIO. For these reasons, and their autonomy tech, this is a no brainer for me. I'd recommend holding commons, or buying OTM long expiration calls. If you have can afford 100 shares, you can sell covered calls and collect nice premiums.\n\n* Price Target - $80\n* Entry - $49\n* Risk (1 out of 5) - 4\n* Timeframe - 3-5 months\n\n*Note: Risk (1 out of 5) is my opinion of how risky the stock and these plays are; 1 being the lowest and 5 is the highest.*", "id": "l2dy29", "created_utc": 1611282483.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "People like op never post real broker statements to back up their claims", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I suppose I could do that if you want, or how about I just live stream my webull balance.

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning January 25th, 2021", "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 25th, 2021.\n\n# **Apple and Tesla earnings, along with the Fed and GDP will drive markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/apple-and-tesla-earnings-vaccine-news-and-the-fed-will-be-focus-of-markets-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Stimulus euphoria may be waning, but investors will have plenty to focus on in the week ahead, as a blast of earnings news hits, the Federal Reserve meets and new data will show the state of the economy at the end of the year.\n*****\n> Stocks gained in the past week on optimism for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, proposed by President Joe Biden. But by Friday, the market lost steam amid increased concerns about the pandemic’s economic impact, and as it seemed Biden would not have an easy time getting the stimulus plan approved.\n*****\n> Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Tesla and more than 100 other S&P 500 companies report earnings in the biggest rush of earnings reports this quarter.\n*****\n> The pandemic will also be a factor as travel restrictions and lockdowns threaten the global economy, and worries remain over the speed of vaccine distributions.\n*****\n> But there is hope that Johnson and Johnson will release positive news on its vaccine results soon, and if that’s the case it could signal another source of vaccines will be available. The J&J vaccine would be a single shot, as opposed to the currently available double-shot vaccines.\n*****\n> “We expect to see their results,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “That could be super bullish.” The company reports earnings on Tuesday.\n*****\n> Hogan said the market may also respond to Covid news. He said the seven-day average in new Covid cases fell below the 14-day average this past week for the first time since Thanksgiving, and if that continues, it could indicate a peak.\n*****\n> If the virus news improves, the market could resume its grind higher in the coming week, said Hogan.\n*****\n> # Economy\n> As for the economy, the first look at fourth quarter real gross domestic product comes Thursday, and it is expected to show growth of 4.7%, according to the CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update survey. For the year, the economists surveyed expect GDP contracted by 3.5%. The economists forecast 5% growth for 2021.\n*****\n> Consumers pulled back at the end of the fourth quarter, evidenced by a surprise 0.7% decline in December retail sales reported this past week, after a negative November.\n*****\n> “You’re really going to see a loss of momentum throughout the quarter,” said Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. “It’s a set up for a really weak Q1.” PMI data shows manufacturing activity has been strong, but labor market data is weak and consumer spending is disappointing.\n*****\n> “You’ve got to juxtapose what’s happening with the vaccine and the virus with what’s happening with underlying data. We’ve definitely seen a lot of the things that could spark a pullback,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equity strategist at RBC.\n*****\n> Calvasina and other strategists expect a sell-off early in the year.\n*****\n> Stocks hit new highs across the major indices Wednesday, as Biden was inaugurated, and many technicians see the market as overbought. The catalyst for a pullback is not clear, but strategists expect the market to gain this year and say a buying opportunity would open up with any decline.\n*****\n> “Do we start to see stuff showing up in that data that makes us question that recovery?” said Calvasina. “My assumption is we’re going to get a lot of volatility in that data, and we’re going to get some downdrafts but it’s not going to be bad enough to erase this upward trajectory we’ve seen in the economy since the second quarter.”\n*****\n> # Fed ahead\nThe Fed is also a powerful backstop for the market, and economists don’t expect the Fed to take any action or change in its dovish tone when it releases its statement Wednesday afternoon, following its two-day meeting.\n*****\n> “I don’t see them making many changes,” said Cummins of NatWest. “They’ll probably acknowledge just the fact that employment was weak.\n*****\n> “It’s going to be pretty clear cut,” he added. “I think Powell will sound similar to what he sounded like in September.” Cummins said the Fed chairman is likely to say the economic outlook depends on the course of the virus and vaccine.\n*****\n> There is also durable goods data Wednesday and personal income and spending data on Friday. The Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, the PCE deflator is also released Friday, and Powell will surely be asked Wednesday afternoon about inflation, which is increasingly being priced into market expectations.\n*****\n> Powell is also likely to be asked his views on fiscal stimulus, which could end up being smaller than some expect.\n*****\n> Hogan of National Securities said the market traded lower on Friday on expectations the package could be smaller and take longer than expected to gain approval.\n*****\n> “I think the realism of saying $1.9 trillion and doing $1.9 trillion are two different things,” he said. “We fall into that trap all the time.”\n*****\n> “What’s happening now is there is no magic wand here,” Hogan added. “It’s not to say there’s no stimulus. It’s just a matter of how long it will take and how much there will be. There’s a little bit of realism.”\n*****\n> Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, said a pullback could be sparked if bitcoin starts to fall more sharply, since some investors would sell stock in response. “When there’s no bid in bitcoin they have to sell something, and they sell stock,” said Maley.\n*****\n> Bitcoin has had a wild early ride in 2021. The cryptocurrency hit a record high of $41,973 on Jan. 12, according to data from Coin Metrics. Days later, it fell about 15%, wiping out as much as $200 billion in just 24 hours.\n*****\n> Bitcoin then regained some of its losses, surging to near $40,000 before another reversal. On Friday, it was trading at $33,200 after dipping below $30,000.\n*****\n> “If this thing starts tanking again, it’s going to cause some forced selling and it’s going to cause some selling in the stock market,” said Maley, adding it will be important to hold the low from Thursday night.\n*****\n> He said the short position in the dollar is also an overcrowded trade that could turn quickly. A resulting short squeeze could cause a dollar rally that would be negative for the stock market. He also is watching Tesla, which reports earnings on Wednesday.\n*****\n> “I think whether it be bitcoin, the dollar, Tesla, one of these crowded trades...it’s going to turn the narrative that’s permeating right now, and if we don’t get a surprise the market will continue to push higher,” he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/eO7d7Zq.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/1GWbub4.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tyhAE90.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/vbOa37l.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8HqdRsR.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NZeUiVr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6E5RdpT.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3Igc9Mf.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hBm7jZ6.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6jxbrCb.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5SrZWIY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/PwdsNDj.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/nseHMnr.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # February Almanac: Worst S&P 500 Month of Post-Election Years\n\n> Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.0% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n> February’s post-election year performance since 1950 is miserable, ranking dead last for S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000. Average losses have been sizable: -1.5%, -3.3% and -1.6% respectively. February ranks tenth for DJIA in post-election years with an average loss of 1.1%. February 2001 and 2009 were exceptionally brutal. NASDAQ dropped 22.4% in February 2001, its third worst monthly loss ever.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d4b3e8cda0a49d76ee55a9768e6c579a/153e22faa5d70761-e1/s400x600/32c0464083a6087a711ac381b9350a1420626ac6.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Housing Closes Out 2020 on a Positive Note\n\n> Housing closed out 2020 on an extremely positive note as both Housing Starts and Building Permits topped forecasts by more than 100K. Since 2002, there have only been ten other months where both reports topped forecasts by more than 100K, and today's report was the third time it happened in the last 12 months!\n\n> The table below breaks down the details of the December report in terms of both single and multi-family units and regions. One of the clear areas of strength was in single-family starts and permits. On a y/y basis, both were up over 25%, and relative to November, starts were up 12% while permits rose 7.8%. Multi-family units, meanwhile, both saw declines with notable weakness in multi-family starts. On a regional basis, most areas of the country saw strength although starts and permits were down m/m and y/y in the Northeast.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Details.png))**\n\n> Given its overall size, you can easily make the case that as goes the housing market, so goes the economy, and history tends to bear this out. The top chart shows the 12-month average of Housing Starts going back to 1967 with recessions overlaid in gray. With the exception of the latest downturn, every prior recession was preceded by a rollover in Housing Starts. Given the sudden onset of the pandemic, housing played no role in the current recession, but once the lockdowns started, the residential housing market wasn't immune to the weakness. Whatever weakness there was didn't last long. As shown in the second chart below, less than a year after the recession started, both the 12-month average of Housing Starts and Building Permits have now moved back above their pre-pandemic highs.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-and-Business-Cycle.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-and-Business-Cycle-Last-10-Years.png))**\n\n> While Housing Starts and Building Permits are both at new multi-year highs, on a population-adjusted basis, they're still closer to levels typically associated with recessions than expansions. After adjusting for population growth, Housing Starts would need to come in above 1.9 million just to keep up with population growth.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Population-Adjusted.png))**\n\n> As for the stocks of homebuilders, the performance of the iShares Home Construction ETF (ITB) tends to track trends in Housing Starts and Building Permits pretty closely, so it's no surprise that it also traded to a new all-time high on Thursday for the first time in three months. As long as interest rates don't see a sudden spike higher, trends in place for the residential housing market remain positive.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-vs-ITV.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Building-Permits-vs-ITV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Impressive Reading From The Philly Fed\n\n> Of the several strong economic data points to have been released today, perhaps the strongest relative to expectations was the Philadelphia Fed's monthly survey on the region's manufacturing sector. The headline index was expected to rise from 11.1 to 11.8. Instead, it more than doubled expectations rising to 26.5. That is the highest reading since last February just before the pandemic's full impact was felt. Overall, the report showed the region's manufacturing sector experienced strong growth in January with accelerating growth in demand, prices, and employment.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-HL.png))**\n\n> In the table below, we break down the various sub-indices of the report. Nearly every component experienced a month over month increase that ranks in the top few percentiles of their respective histories. That also left most indices in the top decile of their historic ranges. That compares to last month in which most readings were far more moderate. Although most indices for current conditions saw impressive readings, the indices for expectations were much more mixed with a larger number falling than rising MoM. Given every one of these indices remains positive, though, the region's manufacturers still have an overall optimistic outlook.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Table1.png))**\n\n> Of all the sub-indices, the New Orders index saw one of the most significant increases in January rising 28.1 percentage points from a barely expansionary reading of 1.9 to a much stronger reading of 30. Going back over the past couple of years, the only times this index was higher was in October (32.9) and February (30.7) of last year. That indicates very strong new order growth after a slowdown in December.\n\n> Similarly, the index for unfilled orders was the only index in contractionary territory (those below zero) last month, but there was a massive improvement this month as the index surged to a reading of 25.6. Both the level of the index and the monthly change stand in the top 1% of all readings going back through the history of the survey which began in 1968. The only times the index has been higher was in August of 1972 (26) and January (29.6) and March (45.1) of 1973. In other words, New Orders remain strong while Unfilled Orders are bouncing back at a historic rate.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Orders.png))**\n\n> While the unfilled orders index reached one of the highest readings on record, the index for Delivery Times actually hit a new record. The index rose 12.7 points to a record high of 30; surpassing the previous record of 21.3 from October of 2017. Higher readings in this index indicate that supplier lead times are longer and vice versa for lower readings. That means a historic number of respondents are seeing delays in their supply chains.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Deliveries.png)**\n\n> Perhaps to get ahead of the growing demand and longer lead times, businesses are also reporting higher inventories. That index rose to the highest level since September of 2019 which also stands in the top 5% of all readings in the history of the data.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Inv.png)**\n\n> Given the stronger demand and tighter supply lines, prices have also been accelerating. Both Prices Paid and Prices Received experienced some of their largest monthly increases on record after rising 20.5 points in January. At 45.4, the index for Prices Paid is at its highest level since August of 2018. Those price increases are also getting passed along to customers as the index for Prices Received is at the highest level since February of 1989. These results echo some other hints of more inflationary conditions like the New York Fed's readings last week and the ISM services and manufacturing report earlier this month.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Prices.png)**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real-time COVID-19 Data Suggests Final Peak May Be Here\n\n> It has been exactly one year since the first COVID-19 case in the United States was reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and to say the world as we know it has been completely changed would be an understatement. Thankfully, we may finally be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n> With the rollout of multiple approved vaccines underway, some real-time COVID-19 indicators and mobility-related data points have put in their final highs (or lows). As shown in the LPL chart of the day, restrictions implemented at the end of 2020 appear to be helping to curb the spread of the virus, as new COVID-19 cases and those currently hospitalized have been on the decline.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Meanwhile, the positive rate has also declined despite daily tests near all-time highs.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> However, while COVID-19 data has been improving, real-time economic indicators like OpenTable reservations show businesses continue to struggle as restrictions on activities to curb the late-2020 surge remain in place.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Similarly, the number of people getting on airlines has fallen back to mid-October levels after the holiday bump. Domestic air travel activity remains 64% below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> “The good news is that cases are declining and vaccine distribution is increasing, but service industries and air travel are clearly still under a lot of pressure,” said LPL Research Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While manufacturing and housing data remain firm, recent data on the job market and consumer spending have been choppy.”\n\n> It’s very encouraging to see COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations improving, a trend we hope will continue until this pandemic ends for good. In the meantime, we will continue to follow high-frequency data to gauge the recovery’s progress. The next report card comes next week with the release of fourth quarter 2020 gross domestic product (GDP).\n\n> We’ll also be closely watching developments in Washington, DC. The economy’s bridge to the other side will likely get stronger in the coming weeks with more stimulus—potentially to the tune of another $700 billion to $1 trillion.\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending January 22nd, 2021** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!]())**\n(VIDEO NOT YET POSTED.)\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 1.24.21**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1l9e_S7KRc))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$AAPL** \n> * **$TSLA** \n> * **$AMD** \n> * **$FB** \n> * **$MSFT** \n> * **$JNJ** \n> * **$GE** \n> * **$BA** \n> * **$MMM** \n> * **$T** \n> * **$LMT** \n> * **$VZ** \n> * **$DHI** \n> * **$AAL** \n> * **$MCD** \n> * **$ABT** \n> * **$FCX** \n> * **$KMB** \n> * **$AXP** \n> * **$RTX** \n> * **$NEE** \n> * **$XLNX** \n> * **$V** \n> * **$SBUX** \n> * **$CAT** \n> * **$LRCX** \n> * **$MA** \n> * **$OFG** \n> * **$NOW** \n> * **$NDAQ** \n> * **$NVS** \n> * **$PLD** \n> * **$PII** \n> * **$MKC** \n> * **$BMRC** \n> * **$ALK** \n> * **$SHW** \n> * **$TXN** \n> * **$NEP** \n> * **$LUV**\n> * **$BOH** \n> * **$LLY** \n> * **$SWKS** \n> * **$PGR** \n> * **$PHG**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hBm7jZ6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/X2a6Awd.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/eACodIM.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR FINANCIAL COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/aC5hzkZ.jpg))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR NASDAQ 100 COMPANIES ONLY FOR THE NEXT 4 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/zIQniHK.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 1.25.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/8R46aDj.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 1.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/f3YFp1i.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  1.26.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/dU2uEBa.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 1.26.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NnafTFh.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 1.27.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/5cGqHaC.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 1.27.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/83z1Sc4.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 1.28.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/awFue6C.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 1.28.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/INHVHTh.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 1.29.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/j11gRzS.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 1.29.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # Apple, Inc. $139.07\n**Apple, Inc.

They had to face the reality, they got relegated so bad  into lower leagues.. for years now they have been playing the most boring football with 6-3-1 Diego Simeone park the bus formation. \n\nRecently the owner and the manager have been following the news and seeing all their old mates killing it and breaking records here and there.. They decided its now the time to wake up from the Alberta hibernation they have been in and play beautiful football again. \n \nFirst Step: They got rid of all the has-beens and the deadwood in the team.. shipped them all on a permanent deal to Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao F.C.\n \n \nNow who is going to be the scorer? Who is going to be MVP? \n \nSo this sad miserable team for years have always had this wonder kid.. A Neymar, Who they played as Center Back in their park the bus ultra conservative game plan.\n \nHere is how it happened. \n \nMost car electronics like AC control or Engine oil sensors notifications are done through a software.. this software processes the inputs through an ECU. Most cars have a single function ECU. It’s 8 Bit or 16 Bit ECU that can’t process much.  \n \nQNX is way more advanced. They have domain ECU, it can process several functions at the same time. It’s a processor and a computer that is capable of a lot of stuff but It’s just sitting there inside your car showing you your tire alignment.\nThis is exactly like having an iphone 12 pro and using it as a calculator. Or having Neymar in your team as a Center Back. \n\nWhy didn’t Blackberry develop it to be do more stuff all these years?\n\nBecause they wanted it to be safe. Blackberry wanted QNX to be known as the safe reliable solution. It’s that safe system that wont distract the driver, or lock him inside by mistake, or get hacked. It’s a boomer strategy. They never had issues or malfunctions and they always deliver on time. Clients didn’t ask for a better solution, so Blackberry never revolutionized it.\n \nThey now see Tesla dashboard capable of doing all these fun and profitable stuff.. They decided to join the party. They are going to use the full capacity of QNX. \n\nNeymar is going to play upfront. Will get all the support and all the freedom to perform in a big league with the big boys. \n\nEven when Jeff Bizos heard that they are finally going to play that wonder kid upfront and he came to pose and take a picture with him and invited him to play a charity game at Amazon. \n \nAmazon deal with Blackberry is just Amazon trying to be in the picture. They want to associated with Blackberry in any capacity. They are the cloud host of the data that Blackberry is going gather from the vehicles with the new QNX and make it available online for whoever is going to need it. Its nothing and probably wont be profitable. It’s publicity.. A charity game. \n\n\n\n1. First car that will have the new QNX will launch in 2023. (Fact)\n\n2. I think car makers expect Tesla are going to have QNX. QNX has always delivered on time and its safe and cant be hacked.\n\n3. 19 car makers have had a joint venture today. The big names of the joint venture like Jeep already using QNX. I expect the rest are going to follow.\n\n4. The fees car makers pay are going to doubled. (Fact)\n\n5. The new system will allow to host third party apps with subscriptions.. like app store and android.

QNX is a very good RTOS, stable and reliable. However the biggest problem for BB to turn QNX into revenue is that the QNX is really at the very bottom of the systems, there is no way that they could charge it like SaaS. Can you imagine you have a car, if you don’t renew the system, you won’t be able to drive it? That’s a joke right? The only way BB can charge the car manufacturers is one time royalty per car, however it’s very hard for BB to increase the price, because there is another option that car manufacturers could use, the Automotive Grade Linux. Tesla and Li Auto’s systems are based on AGL, although some people argue that AGL is not as safe as QNX, Tesla is really a good showcase that QNX is definitely not the only option. Toyota is also moving away from QNX for some of their models starting from 2017. The management of BB realized this problem, they are really concerned and proposed the concept of IVY, but really it’s just a concept, Amazon wants to use it to expand their AWS business, but there is definitely big uncertainty here, as there are a lot of ways to store the driving data, it would be interesting to see the product of IVY on real car.", "id": "l2mxh3", "created_utc": 1611319257.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.52, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "You sir, will be left behind.

So I think they're quite an obvious choice (as can be deduced from the 175mil cars driving around using it as well). \n\nIn terms of royalties, they get a royalty for every car (some cars have multiple QNX systems, which probably results in bigger royalties). A lot of cars are sold every year, so in a sense this is a recurring revenue (even more when they succeed in becoming the standard and are included in new cars too, altough as you say they are being challenged on that).\n\nIVY is a yes or no story.

The PC had an AMD FX 8350 in it. I spent around $1k on the PC upgrading everything. To this day, the PC still has that same AMD FX processor. Before everyone jumped on the Ryzen hype, I was there, believing. When I got the PC I told my dad to buy $100 worth of AMD stock for me. They were worth a dollar something at the time. They are now worth around $100 a share. Sadly, I didn’t make the Tendies from then investment when I was a kid who saw potential in AMD. \n\nOn July 6th of this 2020, I bought in myself because i knew how great the company was from year of experience.

Friends of mine who bought and built PC’s back when I did, had Intel CPU’s in their PC’s. Some of them have never even heard of AMD processors. Between then and now. All of my friends who have upgraded their PC’s have switched to AMD. Everyone who knows a thing or two about PC’s at least considers going AMD instead of Intel. \n\nYou might be thinking it’s too late to buy now, too late to invest in AMD. Your loss. AMD is starting to do the same thing with Graphics Cards, laptops and Server parts that they did with gaming CPU’s. I foresee them having the same takeover they had with gaming CPU’s in the laptop, GPU, and server chip space. The potential is huge. Big cloud  companies like Amazon, Google etc. are starting to switch their servers from Intel Xeon to AMD Epyc. This can make AMD much more money than gaming processors. I don’t know much about Xilinx but i believe if AMD follows the same philosophy they do with their other chips, they can bring Xilinx to the top. AMD had a lot further to go. 🚀🚀\n\nAMD Gang 2013- forever", "id": "l2pqrf", "created_utc": 1611328616.0, "score": 47, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "I’m in", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "AMD have come so far and really turned things around.

GME, AMD, PLTR, AAPL, TSLA, NVIDIA, CRSR, etc. \n\nThere is a stock that almost all the big tech companies, EV companies, and meme stocks had in common. TSM\n\nIf you don’t know what TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) makes computer chips. You definitely own at least one TSM chip, whether you know it or not. \n\nHere is a list of a few of the companies that manufacture their chips with TSMC: (from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20leading%20fabless%20semiconductor%20companies%20such,such%20as%20Allwinner%20Technology%2C%20HiSilicon%2C%20Spectra7%2C%20and%20Spreadtrum.))\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple Inc., Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx,  Altera,Texas Instruments. \n\nIt would take me years to research every single product that TSMC manufactures, but here are a few of the most significant ones that I found:\n\n\nAMD:All AMD chips are manufactured by TSM any reason to buy AMD is also a reason to buyTSM \n   AMD CPU’s: This also includes AMD Ryzen Processors which are the most bought CPUS on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189) As well as the processors that go into many laptops. \n   AMD Graphics Cards: Apple uses AMD Graphics card in their Mac products. They are also in many windows PC’s and laptops, and they are used by miners. \n   Xbox/PlayStation Internals: The PS5 and Xbox Series both use AMD CPU’s and Graphics, which are manufactured by TSM. \n\nApple: Apple manufactures All of its processors at TSM. TSM made chips are in every iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Air Pod, etc. the new M1 Apple in house silicon Macs are also made by TSM. \n\nNvidia: Nvidia is the world largest GPU company. They also make self driving processors for Tesla, Nio and other companies. \n\nQualcomm: Qualcomm makes Arm processors. Qualcomm processors power everything from Samsung phones to smart TV’s to Amazon Alexa. \n\nXilinx: they make most of the 5G processors that go in towers and phones. Samsung Phones use Xilix cellular chips. \n\nTexas Instruments: they make your fucking calculator. \n\nThere are many many more companies that TSM manufactures chips for. They are also on a more advanced process mode than any other company in the world. Do some of your own research and find out what other products TSM makes. \n\nSee how many products in your life are powered by TSM. \n\nChances are, A TSM manufactured chip could be inside your phone, your computer, your TV, your smart speaker and other smart home devices, your wifi router, your cars radio/gps, your cars self driving system (if your car has it). Your wireless headphones, the cell tower in your neighborhood. Even your calculator.\n\nThe “cloud” is also powered by TSM. The servers that google, Amazon, one drive, Spotify, Palantir, etc. \n\nIf you can find just one area of technology that does not, at some point, use TSM manufacturing, comment it below. \n\nIf you can’t then buy some fucking shares. 🚀🚀🚀", "id": "l2s1px", "created_utc": 1611335309.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "I think I love this.
