{"title": "DD - Digital Marketing", "selftext": "Ladies, Gentleman, 🌈🐻's, and random OnlyFans hoes I see on here always begging for money, here is my first attempt at DD in this god forsaken sub. Unfortunately, I left my TA crayons at home, so I'll try to indent and tab over my walls of text as much as possible so that you Zoomers can pay attention to at least 1/4 of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*I do want to clarify that some of the timing of iOS 14 changes could get changed and Facebook could push back against certain parts of the change. I did my best to explain the basics of what I think is going on, but it is possible that I miscommunicated or misunderstood some parts of the iOS 14 update, so digital marketers, feel free to let me know in the comments and I'll edit accordingly\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\n# TL;DR - Apple's iOS 14 - \"Get Zucked, Zuckerberg,\" Said Tim Cook\n\nFor reasons that will be explained below, it is possible that Google and Facebook will begin seeing their duopoly slowly diminish over the next several years (probably >7 years, based on how \"fast\" Turtle Mitch is able to get anything done). I do believe that Google and Facebook will continue to be the top two players in the game for the foreseeable future **(SO I AM NOT RECOMMENDING SHORTING THESE AT ALL YOU 🌈 NOOBS).**\n\nThe core problems that these companies will soon face, especially Facebook, is [anti-trust law suits from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization), more distrust of their platform due to the most recent election, censorship across both platforms, a complete failure of Facebook to properly address the negative side effects of social media on the youth and actually do something about it, and, most importantly, **Apple upgrading to iOS 14 (explained more later).**\n\n* [The Anti-Trust Law Suit from the FTC](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization) talks about Facebook becoming a monopoly and buying all the competition such as Instagram and WhatsApp, instead of competing against them.\n* [iOS 14](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2020/08/30/ios-14-facebooks-apple-nightmare-keeps-getting-worse/?sh=3029be574cfe) update will roll out early 2021. This will hinder the collection of iPhone identifiers for advertisers ([IDFA](https://www.appsflyer.com/mobile-attribution-glossary/idfa/)), one of the primary things used to track users online.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nPrimary Issues For Facebook From The iOS 14 Update\n\n1. **Bidding Issues:** As I stated above, Facebook is going to lose more and more data points as  time goes on, making it so that they aren't able to bid appropriately on someone like Johnny Bravo when he is scrolling through his insta feed. What does this mean? Insta may look at Johnny Bravo as a Joe Schmo and decide that he's not worth bidding up on, so Johnny Bravo will never see those ads of Playboy and Whey Protein that he would have bought if he got an ad for it. (Example for this: with the iOS14 update, Facebook loses its data points to Johnny Bravo's workout apps, so they had no way of knowing he would have been more likely to convert.\n2. **Creating Audiences:** Facebook is going to lose thousands of data points on its users, effectively making it harder to match these audiences into their appropriate buckets. Before, if someone had several golf apps on their phone, you could assume they were a golf lover more easily. Without being able to use that app data sharing, it will be much harder to know they like golf unless they follow several golfing pros / shows in Facebook.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nWith the expectation that Facebook will become less efficient as time goes on and that certain lawsuits could negatively affect the company, many advertisers are looking for other viable options to put their ad dollars. There have been several social media competitors working to monetize their app and become the third wheel of digital marketing. Some of these companies include:\n\n* PINS - Pinterest 🚀🚀🚀\n* SNAP - Snapchat 🚀\n* TWTR - Twitter 🚀\n* Twitch - (Owned by Amazon aka AMZN) 🚀🚀\n* LNKD - LinkedIn (Owned by Microsoft aka MSFT) 🚀\n* Hulu Ads - (Owned by Disney aka DIS) 🚀🚀\n* TikTok - Not sure if correct, but you may be able to get shares [here](https://www.ig.com/en/shares/ipos/bytedance-tiktok-ipo) (ticker tbd, but pretty sure it will be ZOOMR 🚀\n\nThe name of the game is trying figuring out which of these new channels will be the next to gain 5-10% more market share of ad spend from clients and which will be nothing more than moneyless pits since they do a terrible job at monetizing their app and creating engaging ads that lead to conversions for clients (looking at you SNAP and TikTok).\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\nMY RECENT BACKGROUND (aka why should you even bother listening to this autist):\n\n* **Worked in digital marketing and finance for the last 5 years**, also took on several side jobs doing digital marketing for companies\n   * **I managed >$10 million in ad spend across various digital marketing channels (Google/Bing/Facebook/Shopping) over the last 30 days** and over >$40 million in ad spend over the last year\n   * I work with a team of Managers and Directors at my agency to help talk about new opportunities and keep up with digital marketing trends across all channels\n   * Using our >300 clients data, our company is able to look at macro trends at a faster rate, so we can quickly identify which new channels to focus our efforts in (Pinterest/TikTok/Snap/Twitch/etc.)\n      * This was highlighted over the last year or year and a half when we noticed a huge spike in companies using Pinterest as a primary channel for digital marketing. Only more and more companies are going to join into the race, this is just the beginning.\n\n\\-------------------------------\n\n# Any of these stocks or multiple could improve throughout the following years, but my money is on PINS 🚀🚀🚀\n\n* Even with PINS recent run up in stock price, I think there is still plenty of time to buy this stock now.\n   * Our clients are continuing to spend more and more on the Pinterest ad platform and it is returning better performance metrics (ROAS/ROI) than most of the other mentioned channels.\n* Pinterest also relies on on targeting people based on boards they visit/follow/create, combined with using a search query method for ads, somewhat similar to Google's. **This means they don't have to rely as much on pixel data, like Facebook does, to create their audience targeting.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# I think the safest way to make money on PINS is to buy stocks for the long term, but I know that doesn't get some of your little schlongs hard enough.\n\n* Their next earnings are on 2/4/21(after hours) and ***I fully expect them to smash expectations just like McConnell's dad smashed that turtle to give birth to Mitch.***\n   * Look at PINS options that make sense to you for a little after earnings, preferably not 2/5, literally the day after earnings.

{"title": "Is Moderna currently undervalued?", "selftext": "Let me start out by saying that whenever someone like the Motley Fool puts out an article about why this stock or that stock is a sure thing / is not recommended / is a dumpster fire, I have the urge to do the opposite of their recommendations out of sheer spite. And, indeed, those guys put out an [article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/22/why-moderna-stock-plunged-today/) wondering why MRNA took a dive about a week ago. No firm conclusions from them, other than the fact that Moderna isn't on their list of the top ten best stocks which might have been drawn up by a haruspex for all I know.\n\nAnyways.\n\nI'm serious when I say that I think Moderna is undervalued. And I don't have any financial interests in this post, either. Mostly I'm trying to psych myself up because, hey, maybe I'm not talking nonsense. Their stock price just looks absolutely bonkers.\n\nEveryone who bought Moderna at its peak a month ago has been keeping up with the news. No doubt most of you have been watching red numbers in horror. (I'm sure there's at least one bear who's sitting nicely on some puts, but I don't know how many people put their money down on what would've been a very risky wager. It can't be zero.) Moderna got its emergency use authorization from the FDA awhile back; they're not the only company with a COVID vaccine, though, and the headlines for Moderna since then have been pretty bad (in comparison with, say, Pfizer). Many vaccines have side effects, but then you hear about the fact that [side effects with the Moderna vaccine are super common for people with dermal implants](https://www.health.com/condition/infectious-diseases/coronavirus/moderna-vaccine-facial-filler), and every now and then you'll see an article about [some frontline worker getting hospitalized after their Moderna-powered vaccination](https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2020/12/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-triggers-severe-allergic-reaction-in-wallowa-county-health-care-worker-officials-say.html) (there's more than one example, that's just the most recent). And the investors are panicking.\n\nInvestors, of course, are stupid sheep, because this stuff is nothing new. Remember back in 1976 when [an outbreak of the swine flu caused the Ford administration to push through a vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1976_swine_flu_outbreak), then some people who got the vaccine ended up with Guillain-Barré syndrome, ironically causing people to freak out even more? You know how many people actually suffered serious side effects? A few hundred. Out of literally millions -- about 25% of the US population, including President Ford himself, received the vaccine. What happened was basically the worst-case scenario and the chances of any single person getting their nervous system mangled was still infinitesimal. You'd literally have a better chance of being struck by lightning. (Lightning, for what it's worth, doesn't usually kill, either.)\n\nYeah, maybe people who have had cosmetic surgery recently should be careful with the Moderna vaccine. That's nothing. Most people will need to wait their turn anyways, as healthcare workers will largely continue to get the first doses. I don't know if the majority of Americans will have a chance at vaccination before the end of the coming year. For every scaremongering news article reporting on (relatively uncommon) side effects, you get a bunch of other articles about how, say, [Moderna's vaccine was just used to vaccinate a senior living facility](https://katv.com/news/local/moderna-vaccine-administered-at-little-rock-senior-living-facility). (I have no idea about the ratio -- can't be bothered to do the math -- but you should also keep in the mind the old adage of \"if it bleeds, it leads.\") Hell, the biggest risk associated with Moderna's vaccine is probably wastage from negligence or malice, [like what happened with that pharmacist in Wisconsin](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/31/952536531/pharmacist-arrested-accused-of-destroying-more-than-500-moderna-vaccine-doses). Dude straight-up destroyed 550 doses. Big yikes, as the kids say.\n\nI feel like if I don't watch myself I'll veer off into a tangent about vaccine safety in general and other fun topics that're suited for a good ramble. The main point is this: Moderna's still putting out vaccines. They finished Phase 3 trials very, very recently. The verdict? [It works](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/moderna-announces-publication-results-pivotal-142200437.html). If you get COVID you could get seriously fucked up, as the poor souls in the placebo group cofirmed, and the people in the vaccine group all lived. Oh, yeah, and the Department of Defense is buying up doses under some cushy government contract. That probably means something.\n\nMaybe it's just my gut that says a company which has put out a viable COVID vaccine shouldn't have its stock continue to tank indefinitely. The trend line of MRNA prices has been steadily [down since early December](https://i.imgur.com/xSLwIJM.png). In the last few days, though, I think I see the barest [hint of an inflection point](https://i.imgur.com/8tb2XQp.png). In the [past day, even](https://i.imgur.com/z2fIQT1.png).\n\nOr maybe I'm seeing things and it'll continue to slide. If you think that I'm wrong, go ahead and take out a whole bunch of puts, see if you're not too late to pull in a profit. I don't care. I just hope fewer people will be dying from COVID from now on.\n\nThis post is flaired Discussion and not DD because nothing that comes out of my mouth is intelligent enough to be considered Due Diligence.", "id": "kot6ww", "created_utc": 1609572119.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "MRNA is over-hyped and over-valued!

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021 (Happy New Year r/wallstreetbets!)", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. Happy New Year! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week, month and year ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 4th, 2021.\n\n# **Politics will be front and center as a catalyst in the first week of the new year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/politics-will-be-front-and-center-as-a-catalyst-in-the-first-week-of-the-new-year-.html)**\n*****\n> Stocks exit 2020 with strong gains and are riding a tailwind, but already in the dawn of the new year, the market could face its first big challenge.\n*****\n> The final outcome of the 2020 election plays out Tuesday, when voters in Georgia will pick their senators and decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\n*****\n> With President-elect Joe Biden heading to the White House and a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, Wall Street has been comfortable with the view that Biden and the Democrats could not succeed with tax hikes and more progressive policy changes while Republicans hold the Senate.\n*****\n> The runoff election for the two Senate seats Tuesday is widely expected to result in one or both of the incumbent Republican senators retaining their seats. But Democrats are close in the polls and should they win, each party would have 50 seats with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris the tie breaker.\n*****\n> “Georgia is the most important thing to the Biden presidency for the next two years,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. “It’s going to determine what is the legislative agenda and who can get confirmed by the United States Senate.”\n*****\n> Sen. David Perdue is being challenged by Democrat Jon Ossoff, while GOP Sen. Kelly Loeffler is running against Democrat Raphael Warnock. None of the candidates had more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election, so Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two leading candidates for each seat.\n*****\n> “It’s a binary event,” said Mills, adding it’s of growing interest to markets. “The general sense for the market is that Republicans are well positioned to maintain their majority in the Senate. But I think the 2020 election as well as the 2016 election and to some extent, the 2018 election has humbled us … The Senate outcomes, in particular, seem to be less predictable than almost any other elections.”\n*****\n> Mills said the results may take several days to determine, adding to the uncertainty the event could hold for markets. According to an RBC investor survey, 88% expect Republicans to maintain control, and most say that is a positive for the stock market.\n*****\n> “The market tends to shoot first and ask questions later. There will certainly be a reaction if Democrats win both those seats,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. Strategists say there could be a relief rally if Republican incumbents see a clear victory.\n*****\n> “That totally dominates [trading] because it’s about do we have status quo or do we have Democrats controlling all parts of Washington and what that means for spending and taxes,” Boockvar said. “I think you could see the worries about taxes overwhelming any thoughts on the benefits of more spending” by Democrats.\n*****\n> # By the numbers\n> A year of extreme volatility ended with a big win for stocks, as the pandemic steered the course for markets. The S&P 500 was up 16.3% for the year, ending at 3,756. That gain comes after a 34% decline early in the year, followed by a powerful more-than 65% rebound. Technology was the big winner for the year, and the Nasdaq was up 43.6% at 12,888.\n*****\n> Besides the runoff vote, the market will be watching a stream of data in the coming week, including the important December jobs report Friday. That could show fewer than 100,000 jobs were added as the spreading virus impacted hiring and layoffs. There were 245,000 jobs created in November.\n*****\n> There is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday, and a number of Fed speakers, including Vice Chairman Richard Clarida on Friday.\n*****\n> The virus itself could also be a factor for stocks.\n*****\n> Conventional wisdom for the coming year has been that vaccines will be widely distributed, and by the second half things will start to get back to normal and the economy will pick up. But the initial distribution has been slow, and far short of the 20 million targeted for December by President Donald Trump’s task force.\n*****\n> In that recent RBC survey, three quarters of investors were optimistic about vaccine distribution with 80% expecting a majority to be vaccinated by the end of 2021. “We suspect that the positive outlook for the stock market and the economy would deteriorate if expectations for a smooth vaccine rollout are not met,” RBC strategists wrote.\n*****\n> They also noted that nearly 60% of the investors surveyed believe high stock market valuations are problematic.\n*****\n> “This suggests to us that any threat to the economic and earnings recovery story could spark profit-taking. On this point, it is worth noting that the vaccine was the No. 1 issue keeping investors up at night, closely followed by monetary policy and excessive optimism on the recovery,” the strategists noted.\n*****\n> Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, said investors will also be watching the formal acceptance of the Electoral College vote Wednesday. Strategists expect the vote count to confirm Biden’s presidency.\n*****\n> However, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley says he will challenge the certification, and several House Republicans have already vowed to contest the election at that time. If one House member and a senator jointly object to a state’s slate of electors, the two houses of Congress must separately debate and vote on the objection.\n*****\n> Strategists see little chance of any impact on the election outcome, but there could be fireworks. Trump has been claiming since the election that there was fraud but multiple courts failed to find any truth to the claims.\n*****\n> Rupkey said investors are not taking into account enough potential for political risk from the deep animosity between the two political parties.\n*****\n> “I think the additional stimulus and hopes for additional stimulus, and infrastructure spending in 2021, I don’t know that that is such a slam dunk, because of the issue of political instability,” he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/cAXzkxf.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/HnhSggu.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF THURSDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/5egoYkS.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/UlNY0Um.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/z4wSKuc.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/32Ma7rG.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mRJqU8A.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Thursday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/J7B4Njx.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/JJmAiwp.png))**\n\n# **Thursday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1ARzFfu.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Why A Year-End Rally Bodes Well For 2021\n\n> Welcome to the last day of 2020! It has been a devastating year in so many ways, yet for investors it has been quite rewarding. Much of the gains in 2020 have taken place the final two months, with the S&P 500 Index up more than 14% in November and December so far, the best end to a year since WWII.\n\n> A big end of year rally could have bulls smiling in 2021. “Turns out a 10% or more gain the final two months of the year has equaled a higher S&P 500 the following year every single time since World War II,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, January was also higher every single time as well, so maybe this strong rally to end the year is a clue for higher prices into next year.”\n\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 gained an average of more than 18% the year following a 10% or more surge during the final two months of the year. Meanwhile, January was up 5 for 5 as well, rising an impressive 3% on average.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/12.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Here’s what the average year looks like after the prior year gains 10% or more the final two months compared to a typical year. Once again, strong returns are the playbook historically.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/blog-12.31.20-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We wish everyone a happy and safe New Years Eve and we’ll see you in 2021!\n\n*****\n\n> # Fifty to Zero in 283 Days\n\n> In a year with some pretty crazy charts, the one below is right up there with some of the best. After all the markets have been through this year, bot the S&P 500 and Long-Term Treasuries have seen nearly identical returns on a total return basis. That's right, with just a few hours left in the trading year, the S&P 500's total return in 2020 has been a gain of 17.6%, while Long Term US Treasuries, as measured by the B of A Merrill Lynch Long-Term Treasury Index has rallied 17.3%. What makes this nearly identical performance all the more incredible is that on March 23rd, the performance gap between the two was more than 50 percentage points.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds.png))**\n\n> The fact that stocks and bonds have essentially seen identical returns this year isn't typical. The chart below shows the annual performance spread between the S&P 500 and long-term US Treasuries going back to 1978. During that time, the S&P 500 has historically outperformed long-term US Treasuries by an average of 3.9 percentage points per year, but the average gap in performance between the two has been over 15 percentage points. In the 43 years since 1978, there have only been seven other years where the performance spread between the two asset classes was less than five percentage points and just two years (1985 and 1992) where the performance spread was less than a percentage point.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123120-Stocks-Bonds-Annual-Spreads.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Back-to-Back Big Years for Technology\n\n> With just two trading days (including today) left in 2020, the S&P 500 Technology sector is on pace for its second year in a row of rallying more than 40%. Going back to 1990, the only time the Technology sector experienced back-to-back returns of more than 40% was in 1998 and 1999. Back then, not only was the Technology sector up 40%+ in back-to-back years, but it was also up over 75% in both of those years. If you think markets are pretty crazy these days, they still have nothing on the last two years of the 1990s!\n\n> In terms of cumulative returns, the Technology sector is up 210% since the last trading day of 2018, whereas in 1999 it was up 317% in a two-year span. What's also interesting to note about the last 31 years of returns for the Technology sector is how it has only experienced five down years, while the S&P 500 has been down in ten different years during that span. Furthermore, since 2009 there has only been one down year and the decline was a paltry 1.6%. Not a bad 12-year run!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Performance.png))**\n\n> Given that the sector has more than doubled in the last two years, there have been some big individual winners. Topping the list with a gain of just under 400% is Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). On the last day of 2018, AMD traded hands for under $20 per share. Today's it's over $90. AMD has a lead of more than 100 percentage points over the next closest stock - NVIDIA (NVDA) - which is up 288%. Interestingly, there aren't a lot of major outliers to the upside compared to the sector's 210% gain, but that's because Apple (AAPL), the sector's largest stock, has paced the sector's gains by rallying more than 240%.\n\n> On the downside, just four stocks in the Technology sector have declined in the last two years. The worst of these has been DXC Technology (DXC) which has lost more than half of its value, while Juniper (JNPR) and HP Enterprise (HPE) are down between 10% and 20%. Lastly, FLIR Systems (FLIR) has declined less than 2%, so depending on how it acts in the next two days, it could move into positive territory just as Intel (INTC) did yesterday after Third Point bailed it out and moved the stock barely into positive territory for the last two years.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Technology-Sector-Stocks.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Growth Dragging on Small Caps\n\n> In the past couple of weeks, we have frequently been keeping tabs on small-cap equities which have been particularly strong performers of late resulting in very overbought readings as well as extended valuations. More specifically, taking a look at growth-oriented small-caps, with only a couple days left in the year small-cap growth stocks—proxied by the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO)—are on pace to have outperformed large-cap equivalents in 2020. On December 10th, IWO surpassed the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW) in terms of YTD performance, and even after pulling back in the past week, IWO is still in the lead.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large1.png))**\n\n> As a result of recent moves, there has been a sharp reversal on a relative basis between the two ETFs in the past week. In the chart below, we show the ratio of the Russell 2000 Growth ETF (IWO) versus the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW). This ratio took off beginning in the early fall meaning small-cap growth drastically outperformed large-cap growth. But the former's weakness in the past several days has put a halt to that move.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large2.png))**\n\n> As to just how sharp of a reversal this was, in the five days through yesterday's close, the decline in the ratio of IWO to IVW was the largest since June. Before that, April and March saw declines that were even larger. Not only was this one of the biggest drops in the relative performance of small-cap growth to large-cap growth in the past few months, but that also stands in the bottom 0.5% of all readings going back to 2000 when the ETF first began trading. Outside of this past spring, the only other periods that have also experienced this type of underperformance of small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth was at various points in 2011, 2008, and a handful of times in the early 2000s.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large3.png))**\n\n> Small-cap underperformance has not necessarily been broad though. For value stocks, small caps (IWN) have generally outperformed large caps (IVE) for the entirety of the new bull market. While there was a bit of a turn lower in recent days, it has been nowhere close to as dramatic of a move as growth stocks.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-Small-Large4.png))**\n\n> In the charts below, we show average performance over the past week of Russell 2000 stocks broken into deciles based on their price to sales and price to book ratios. As shown, the most aggressively valued deciles have averaged the worst performance in the past week. Stocks with low P/S and P/B ratios have not been immune from the weakness, but they have held up significantly better.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/123020-RTY-Decile.png))**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/5udYrpD.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/hQIRBYI.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 1.4.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Monday 1.4.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  1.5.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ZAbC0jw.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 1.5.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/wKzyMxp.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BUFtffd.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 1.6.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/cDQHHqx.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 1.7.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/NhUT413.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 1.7.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/7p03h4M.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 1.8.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 1.8.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # Micron Technology, Inc. $75.18\n**Micron Technology, Inc.
