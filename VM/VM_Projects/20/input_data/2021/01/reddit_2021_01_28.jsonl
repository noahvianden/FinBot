{"title": "GME / Short Squeeze - Worth a read. Written and posted by u/dwarfboy1717", "selftext": "  \nPosted by u/dwarfboy1717 [1 day ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ws97/friday_12921_gme_expiry_date_means_nothing_dont/) **Friday 1/29/21 GME Expiry Date Means Nothing. Don't buy into the hype - shorts aren't just afraid of this Friday. Come down the rabbit hole with me.Discussion**üì∑\n\n*Note: I am mostly summarizing the aggregate of explanations currently floating around about the 1/29/21 option expiry date. I don't claim any knowledge. This is not investment advice. Do your own research, don't invest what you can't afford to lose, and if something feels wrong it probably is.*\n\n**TL;DR: This isn't about options (yet), it's about shares, and Institutional Investors are playing a dangerous game by convincing us (some of y'all have bought in without realizing it) that a magical short squeeze has some 3-day time limit, that Friday is somehow the end game, and are hoping that when investors don't see a $5,000 short squeeze by next week they will fold and take their gains at a \"reasonable\" double-digit stock price. Don't believe them. They can survive through mid-late February before the true short squeeze smashes upward. And I'll be ready. I like this stock and believe in it's long term potential, and I think it's undervalued.**\n\n**THESIS:** If institutional investors can (1) convince retail investors to sell stock at low prices and (2) convince their lenders to wait, then the 0.01% get richer.\n\n**JUSTIFICATION:** There is so much public sentiment (passion, enthusiasm, excitement, anger, whatever) surrounding short (\\~1 day) price movements\\*, and Friday's expiring options (these are also end of month contracts), that it seems like big clever money may be trying to artificially create a sort of bear trap for shareholders.\n\nWhatever happens in the next week or so (crest to $700? crash to $60?) almost means nothing in the long term, but could fool investors into giving these guys CHEAP ways out of their 140% float short interest positions. Remember, these are people who have been dumping tons of money for a long time, shorting the stock when it was *in the single digits*. They've been hoping for a GameStop bankruptcy, and manufacturing one as best they can.\n\n**IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME:** Remember the VW infinite squeeze, where we saw **weeks** of crazy price movement before the actual peak. And that is a mild case, as most of the shares were held by an entity with legal, competitive, and strategic reasons and obligations forcing them to hold shares and **artificially reducing the float, or available shares for trading**. This reduced supply caused the short squeeze.\n\nHowever, this time around we've got a huge short interest, much much larger by comparison than that from VW's 2008 peak, to the tune of **140% of shares available for trading (float)**. They've massively overreached, and are going to pay the price for that. **But they haven't yet.**\n\n**SO YOU'RE SAYING THERE'S A CHANCE:** This time, however, if the big dogs can shake shareholders hard enough, weak links break and paper hands fold and a fantastic long term play starts to seem out of reach. The market manipulation wins.\n\n**DARE TO BELIEVE:** Unfortunately for the shorts, GME has [real long term prospects](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2zk5e/a_hedge_fund_managers_perspective_on_gme/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) to revolutionize the gaming industry for consumers, and now has the attention and potential equity momentum (if they play it smart, which I think the new leadership will) to make this a reality.\n\nFrom that link above:\n\n>In GME's case the rise in the stock price itself will likely result in fundamental improvements to the underlying economic metrics of the company.\n\nI believe.\n\nHowever, if the shorts can fight, sneak, manipulate, and otherwise adjust the share price down this week then they start to see light at the end of the tunnel. They make 2-3 week plans for doing the same thing. For them, prices don't have to bottom back out, they just have to convince enough people to sell that they buy thrmselves a few weeks before a short squeeze really takes them all under.\n\n\\*Some of this price movement is shorts covering, but much is actual legitimate investment between retail investors and other institutional investors who have seen the light. Remember, TSLA didn't get to where it is because one company made some bad short positions. But if GME shorts can convince everyone that a 3-day squeeze is all they get until GME crashes to some \"normal\" level, then they win.\n\nEveryone getting hyped about Friday is playing into their hands. Yeah maybe some will need to take gains after a Friday pop, but a smart long-term hold position on GME is what they're really afraid of. And I want to be a shareholder in GME's future, as many wanted to be with TSLA. And sure, maybe if everyone else thinks that way too, there may be an incidental short squeeze that wrecks the uber wealthy in mid-late February along the way.\n\n**Again, I am not claiming to be knowledgeable or insightful, just commenting my best guesses. Nobody knows the future. This is not investing advice.**\n\nEdit: we are seeing this dangerous bias even in such reputable characters as /u/thicc_dads_club with his [recent speculation - GME Endgame](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5x0fc/gme_endgame/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).\n\nüöÄ", "id": "l6wow6", "created_utc": 1611840858.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "They‚Äôve already started their divide and conquer strategy. \n\nPreventing people on RH and other brokerages from buying.

{"title": "Fuck you media - Why GME is more than a trade (from german wsb)", "selftext": "// I posted this on the German Wallstreetbets subreddit earlier today and got a hint that a translated version would be relevant for you guys as well. The good [https://www.reddit.com/user/atticus\\_marmorkuchen](https://www.reddit.com/user/atticus_marmorkuchen) has thankfully translated the text and replaced a few German terms with the American terms. You can find the original thread here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/mauerstrassenwetten/comments/l6s69h/fickt\\_euch\\_medien/](https://www.reddit.com/r/mauerstrassenwetten/comments/l6s69h/fickt_euch_medien/) \\- Stay strong my retards!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHello everyone,\n\nas we all know, the majority of mainstream media is now aware of our situation and they are calling us gamblers and ‚Äûinternet kids‚Äú who don‚Äôt understand the market. Perhaps this is due to billionaire market manipulation, perhaps it is what they really think about us. Either way, it makes me fucking mad.\n\nI‚Äôm well in my 30s now, worked for over 10 years and did everything they expected of me: A bachelor and master in engineering, then even an MBA after that. I started work-live at 22 and did my two masters degrees simultaneously, just so I can start growing my 401k as early as possible.\n\nBy now I make 140 000 $ a year. During all this time I industriously invested in ETFs and the like. I even bought a few cryptos here and the odd share there. Every two years I get a letter telling me that I just earned another 2 points for my pension fund and that in the future I will be eligible to receive my long awaited retirement money. Roughly 3 000 $ per month (before tax).\n\n3 000 $? This is about 26% of my current monthly income. This is a fucking joke. And you know what drives me mad? I will have to tax it 100%. I don‚Äôt profit from all the tax cuts boomers got in the 90s and early 00s.\n\nDo you understand what I want to tell you? Do you get it now? We can already see, that all future generations are fucked. And meanwhile we are bailing out boomers who back in the days could afford to buy a house with a stupid 9to5 where all you had to do was clock in. With a safe job that didn‚Äôt require you to be flexible and work after hours. And these people now are telling us we are gamblers and we ‚Äûshould just work hard‚Äú so we can earn our property.\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about GME. The internet kids that are fucking over the hedge-funds and wall-street. The inexperienced, stupid traders that violate the rules of the market.\n\nRules? It was you! You made these rules. You told us what we are allowed to do. And now we have found a stock, that we maybe even have a little nostalgia attached to (despite their terrible trade-in offers, it was always a place where you could hang out with friends to browse and it was a cool hotspot for gamers). And then we see the numbers, see the percentage of shorts, the incredible amount and wonder: is that justified? A company, that tries to reinvent itself and payed off their debt. And we realize, that the stock was perhaps a bit underrated.\n\nSo the internet starts to discuss. Numbers are collected, DDs are produced, analysis published. And we don‚Äôt need you for that. We don‚Äôt need CNBC, WSJ or The Post. All the information is on the internet, free for everybody to find. And finally even the last retard sees and understands: Your greedy hedgefunds fucked up. Big time. You fucked up and now we can profit. \n\nAnd it makes me mad how we are getting blasted from all angles now, how they even consider halting the trade for 30 days. Where were you, when Lehman fucked us over? Where were you when the dotcom bubble burst? Where were you, when millions lost their homes over some bust in the casino full of fancy dressed suits that we call the wallstreet? Right‚Ä¶, I forgot. It only affected the guy from the street and not the real big players. Because them you bailed out.\n\nAnd where are you now, when Corona (not only) financially fucked a majority of our generation and probably the generations to come? Where are the bailouts for students? Where is our rent bailout? 600 $? Is this a joke? Many people are lucky when they can even survive 1 month longer with that.\n\nFuck yourself. You don‚Äôt give us the chance for a secure retirement, you don‚Äôt give the young generations stability during the crisis. We are starting our working life with the perspective, that in the end we could very well end up in poverty and at the same time encourage normal people to make debt that they perhaps never will be able to repay.\n\nAnd then you disgusting animals are mad when we buy GME after your old friends have become too greedy and we see our potential for good a good return.\n\nBut I will HOLD. I will never stop holding. And I will refuel the rocket. Because I can. And because with every single penny that I put into GME, some jerk on Wallstreet will choke and the suits start gasping.", "id": "l6yltb", "created_utc": 1611845525.0, "score": 1048, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": " This is not only for 2008 üíéüôåüèΩ", "score": 77, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lets spread the message!

We know it‚Äôs led to frustration and confusion, and wanted to provide some clarity.\n\nAs a brokerage firm, we have many financial requirements, including SEC net capital obligations and clearinghouse deposits. Some of these requirements fluctuate based on volatility in the markets and can be substantial in the current environment. These requirements exist to protect investors and the markets and we take our responsibilities to comply with them seriously, including through the measures we have taken today.\n\nTo be clear, this decision was not made on the direction of any market maker we route to or other market participants.\n\nThe past year in particular has shown us that the financial markets are for everyone‚Äînot just institutional investors and hedge funds.

{"title": "Template to send your Congress Person", "selftext": "Hello Congress<MAN/WOMAN> <NAME>, I am a resident of <CITY/DISTRICT> and I need you as my representative to call for an investigation into securities market manipulation by large hedge funds colluding with affiliated brokerage houses to cover the losses of their reckless short selling.\n\nAs you have likely seen in the news, retail investors have found a number of companies that they believe in and who have been the targets of relentless short selling by large hedge funds. These include GameStop, Blackberry, and Bed, Bath and Beyond, among others. A number of large hedge funds took notoriously risky short positions on these companies, in GameStop‚Äôs case short selling more stock than had been issued on the market, effectively forcing these companies towards bankruptcy for their own profit.\n\nBut when a number of individual retail investors decided to take the other side of their trade and bet on these companies' recovery, the hedge funds decided they could not handle the risk they had signed up for. A number of brokerages affiliated with Citadel, who purchased a stake in Melvin Capital, one of the short sellers who took on the largest and riskiest positions, have ceased allowing their customers to buy shares in these companies in the name of controlling \"volatility.\" It is an utterly transparent move to help the hedge funds cover their positions at the expense of retail investors, yet another version of the inexhaustible Wall Street bailouts.\n\nThis is blatant collusion and market manipulation by large Wall Street firms happening right now and it cannot stand. I demand an investigation into these unfair practices. Congresswoman Tlaib of Michigan has publicly called for such an investigation and I am asking you to give her your full support in the endeavor to protect our markets and individual investors.\n\nThank you,<NAME>  \n\n\nCredit: /u/Slipperyjimminy (It was removed by mods when he originally posted it)", "id": "l7c09m", "created_utc": 1611875468.0, "score": 187, "upvote_ratio": 0.99, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "My Congress person is a piece of shit.
