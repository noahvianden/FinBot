Although the stock has dropped slightly since then and have mostly been trading sideways, I thought I would share my thoughts about this company before they report earnings on May 12.\n\n \n\n\\- **Coupang** ([Korean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_language): Ïø†Ìå°) is a South Korean e-commerce company founded in 2010. It is incorporated in [Delaware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaware), [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States).[\\[2\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupang#cite_note-2)\n\n\\- Coupang is founded by South Korean businessman Bom Kim who dropped out of Harvard Business School after 6 months.\n\n\\- Currently Coupang is the largest e-commerce company in South Korea\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Business Model** \n\n \\- ‚ÄúWe are building the future of commerce‚Äù -- Coupang S-1\n\n\\- A key competitive advantage of Coupang is what they call their ‚ÄùRocket Delivery Service‚Äù\n\n\\- This includes their Dawn and Same-Day Delivery. Arriving before 7am if ordered before midnight or later in the day if ordered in the morning (this makes purchasing perishable items such as produce convenient).\n\n\\- They promise next-day or faster delivery on nearly 100 percent of orders.\n\n\\- Coupang claims that 70 percent of the South Korean population lives within 7 miles of a Coupon Logistics Center\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Opportunity** \n\n \n\n**- Korean Attractive Commerce Market**\n\nKorea is the fourth largest economy in Asia. In addition, South Korea has the following key traits:\n\n* High Mobile Penetration\n* Retail Competitive Landscape\n* Lifestyle\n\n**- Coupang has an extremely integrated model. From the technology to the distribution**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Risk** \n\n \n\n* Operation results might fluctuate significantly\n* Future growth rate is hard to predict as the company aims to forgo short-term profitability for long-term growth\n* If the company loses its senior executive members, it might not be able to fulfill its current vision.\n* The company has had multiple years of large losses.\n\n \n\n**Financials** \n\n \n\n* Total Net Revenue: 11.967 billion dollars (2020)\n* Cost of sales: 9.98 billion dollars (2020)\n* Operating, general, and administrative expenses: 2.51 billion dollars (2020)\n* Operating loss: 527 million dollars (2020)\n* Cash and Cash equivalents: 1.25 billion dollars (2020)\n* Long-Term Debt: 353 million dollars (2020)\n* Total Liabilities: 5.67 billion dollars (2020)\n\n **IPO** \n\n \n\n* Coupang went public earlier this month offering 130 million shares at $35 each, giving the company $4.55 billion \n* The stock closed at $49.25 on its first day.\n* Coupang closed at $48.75 today (March 30, 2021). \\*41.90 at end of April 30th\n\n **Valuation** \n\n \n\n\\- 2020 total net revenue was 12 billion, assuming growth of 100 percent, the 2021 total net revenue would be 24 billion.\n\n\\- Using a forward P/S ratio of 5, we get the valuation of 120  billion dollars. Divided by 1.54 billion outstanding shares I get a 12-month price target of **77.922  dollars.**\n\n**- This represents a 60 percent increase from the closing share price today.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **Why We Should Invest in Coupang** \n\n \n\n* Household name: There are almost nobody in South Korea now who has not heard of Coupang before. Their status in South Korea is similar to that of Amazon in the US.\n* Overseas Expansion: Coupang can achieve such a high-level of revenue and revenue growth without even entering foreign markets. Entering other Asian markets could potentially increase revenue by an even larger percentage\n* Rapidly decreasing operating losses. While still not profitable, profitability is definitely achievable within a few years.\n* Less political uncertainty: With US-China tensions rising, Coupang is a safe alternative for those who want to invest in Asia.\n\nSource:  \n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1834584/000162828021001984/coupang-sx1.htm#i4773fe05195046f8b8cb330d78922a20\\_261](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1834584/000162828021001984/coupang-sx1.htm#i4773fe05195046f8b8cb330d78922a20_261)\n\n*Coupang S-1 (2021)*", "id": "n42k48", "created_utc": 1620064339.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "The model works well in a place like Korea where the 2 largest cities are on opposite sides of the country (helping with distribution).

That is particularly relevant for e-commerce when you have to compete with the likes of SEA (which already managed to beat giants like Alibaba there, despite the presence of a large population of overseas Chinese).\n\nIn general SK companies tend to have difficulty abroad for that reason (with notable exceptions such as Samsung). SE Asia has a very different culture from SK, so it requires the sort of flexibility that's rare in SK companies. Asia is full of cultural and perception traps due to complex ethnic, religious and historical factors and due to economic nationalism and SK often fares badly in that kind of perception game, for example in Indonesia and Indo-China (part of it is due to mutual prejudice and another is due the attitude of the SK government for example toward places such as Thailand and Vietnam). They have a better perception in Central Asia and in the West (and a pretty bad perception in the ME, Africa and Central/South America). They also have a pretty bad perception in China (which of course is mutual).\n\nThat doesn't mean that Coupang couldn't overcome all this.

The SPY rose 5% in April, for the best performance since November of last year. Following a rotation into cyclical and reopening stocks at the beginning of the year, April saw the communication services and consumer discretionary sectors lead gains in the SPY, returning to the leadership position. Growth stocks continued underperforming, paring recent gains after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said some sectors of the market appeared ‚Äúfrothy‚Äù. Looking ahead, market participants continue to monitor corporate earnings and wait for more economic data, particularly the April jobs report that will be released May 7th. \n\nA wave of stronger-than-expected earnings, especially in banks and mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), have fueled the latest rally in the market. In the US, effective distribution of the vaccine and the gradual reopening of the economy have led to a surge in consumer spending, driving corporate profits way past analyst estimates. As of Friday, 86% of S&P 500 companies had beaten first-quarter earnings expectations, according to FactSet data. This would mark the highest proportion since at least 2008, if the current rate holds through the end of first-quarter earnings season.\n\nThe Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March‚Äôs gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.\n\nLast week, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said ‚ÄúAmerica was back on the move again‚Äù following the coronavirus pandemic..
