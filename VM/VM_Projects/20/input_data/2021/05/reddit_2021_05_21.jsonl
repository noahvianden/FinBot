So it is ideal for a PMCC position. You can buy several in the money long calls and then sell the monthly short calls to pocket some premium. I'm already on my third monthly call. I've done about 20% on the appreciation of the long call and another 20% on the income from the short calls. If we continue with this slow appreciation on TBT and finish the year around $24 or so, it will end up being a two-bagger between the call appreciation and the PMCC income.\n\nSo if your thesis is the same as Burry's and you believe rates/inflation are heading up, then I would take a hard look at this trade.

Only problem is if the FED goes complete apeshit and let's inflation go to record levels, while still holding interest rate at rock bottom. \n\n\nRead some articles recently where Jpow isn't looking to raise rates until late 2022 or maybe 2023, but seeing it almost double last month to 4.2 has got me worried about the trend.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "No, if you look at the 10-year reference treasury rate, it hit rock bottom around August 2020 and has been climbing steadily since. If you have TradingView, look up a chart on TNX. We're now at 1.64% from a low of 0.50%.\n\nIf you understand how the macroeconomic variables interact with one another (I live in a country that has experienced inflation, so I have lived through all of this first hand), you'll know that no central bank is all powerful. They have a number of tools at their disposal, but they are not omnipotent. The scenario you are describing -- high inflation with low interest rates, it is very unlikely and would be counterproductive. I'll explain why:\n\nOnce inflation starts heating up, the market will naturally demand a higher return on bonds, pushing their price down and thus the rate up. If the Fed were to intervene by buying up those bonds it would require even more emission (more future inflation) to stop rates from rising. The market is not stupid and won't just take this lying down. You'd see an immediate weakening of the dollar against all the major currencies along with a rise in commodities. The carry trade (borrowing money in dollars, paying a low interest rate, to convert to a stronger currency and get paid a higher interest rate) would exacerbate the dollar weakness.\n\nThe inflationary pressure has to be released somewhere in the economy. Its best to allow a small increase in the interest rate instead of causing a huge devaluation of the dollar and spike in commodities. We've already seen this recently with the rise in gold, soybeans, copper, and other commodities. If interest rates get held down artificially, this process would accelerate much quicker.\n\nDr. Burry knows all of this as well, and he's decided to take a position in TBT, so you know where he stands on the issue.

The dollar is the worlds currency, and the feds knows this too well.
