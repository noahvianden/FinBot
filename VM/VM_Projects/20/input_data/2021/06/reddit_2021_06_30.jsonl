{"title": "Long term company research & analysis on SoFi (filter through the noise)", "selftext": "I‚Äôve seen a ton of posts about trading SOFI and short squeezes etc. but I‚Äôm investing in SoFi for the LONG TERM and here‚Äôs why:\n\n1. SoFi actually had positive EBITDA in Q1 and is forecasting $27M in EBITDA for 2021! How many high growth, recent IPO‚Äôs can say that!  SoFi is forecasting $254M EBITDA in ‚Äô22, $484M ‚Äô23 ($1.17B in ‚Äô25 but that‚Äôs a bit of a wild card since it‚Äôs so far in the future‚Ä¶).  That‚Äôs a 162% CAGR over 3 years and 113% CAGR over 5.  They exceeded guidance in Q4‚Äô20 and in Q1‚Äô21 !!!  Their forecast is also somewhat conservative since it excludes the impact of the pending bank charter acquisition which could increase these #‚Äôs.  It also excludes some of the new offerings that were just announced like Auto Loans and IPO investing (underwriting).\n2. Rapid revenue and customer growth! Forecast of $980M in 2021 to $2.1B in 2023 is a 29% CAGR over 3 years (28% CAGR over 5 years).  2.28M unique customers in Q1 and targeting 3M customers by the end of 2021.  They have a great track record of upselling existing customers (very low cost to upsell vs. acquire) with about 1/4 of their customers using multiple products, this should only improve as they add more product lines (like auto loans‚Ä¶and hopefully options soon!)\n3. Galileo technology platform actually turns a major cost center into a profit center and makes them a true Fintech vs. just an online bank like Ally etc.  Galileo is expected to grow 55% CAGR from 2020-2025 with an estimated 62% margin.  This gives them a great B2B model and de-risks a 100% banking model.  Galileo is the Fintech engine behind 70M accounts (Q1 #‚Äôs) and customers include Robinhood, Chime, Monzo, Revolt etc. Galileo‚Äôs APIs power functionalities including account set-up, funding, direct deposit, ACH transfer, IVR, early paycheck direct deposit, bill pay, transaction notifications, check balance, and point of sale authorization as well as dozens of other capabilities.\n4. Future bank charter with the pending acquisition of Golden Pacific Bancorp will help juice profitability and revenue growth and lowers their cost of capital.  This is expected to grow profits from $484M in 2023 to $718M in 2023.  If their estimates are correct AND the acquisition goes through that would increase the 3-year earnings CAGR from 162% up to 198%!  This deal should close by the end of 2021\n5. Solid leadership:  Anthony Noto, CEO has a strong background in Finance with Goldman Sachs and the NFL (CFO) AND Technology from Twitter (COO).  Chris Lapointe, CFO also has a great mix of Tech (Uber) and finance from Goldman Sachs.  Similar story with the rest of the executive team.  Strong marketing with SoFi stadium in LA (Superbowl venue) and SoFi‚Äôs investment team is frequently on CNBC (Liz Young etc.)\n6. Rising interest rates is actually POSITIVE for SoFi!  Banks pay customers a relatively low interest rate on short term deposits and charge customers a higher interest rate on longer term loans.  As rates rise their margins increase.  With rates at record lows, a rapidly recovering economy and inflation on the horizon rates should only go higher (maybe substantially and much faster than normal).  The bank charter only enhances this‚Ä¶.\n7. I invested a little in SoFi (via IPOE) originally after it pulled back and wanted to invest more BUT before I did, I opened accounts at SoFi to verify that it‚Äôs all that they say it is.  So I opened a checking account, 2% cash back credit card, active investing account, automated investing account.  This is the real deal:  Products are SUPER competitive (2% cash back on a CC with NO annual fee!), Checking account pays 0.25% with no fees, $0 stock trades for active investing and direct access to IPOs (I participated in their 1st 4 IPOs today - 6/29) and no cost automated advisor investing.  They really treat you like a ‚Äúmember‚Äù and customer service has been great so far.  The mobile App is very user friendly with a ton of added features (credit score, education etc.).\n   1. If you own SoFi stock for the long term and you‚Äôre not a customer yet ‚Äì you‚Äôre doing yourself a disservice.  You are an owner in the company and you should be profiting from your own banking!  Try them ‚Äì you‚Äôll love them and start consolidating all your accounts to them like I am.\n8. Post lockup period (ended Monday 6/28) we should see a lot more interest from  ETFs, Mutual Funds, Institutional investors and analysts.   Volume should dissipate and the stock held its ground even with 50M shares trading a day (10X normal volume). There is a ton of demand for not only high growth but also PROFITABLE companies and FinTech specifically.   Based on their market cap and projections for profitability they should be added to the Russell indexes next year and possibly the S&P Indexes if they can meet the profitability criteria etc.\n\nAnalyst Price Targets:\n\nOppenheimer:  Overweight $30 Price Target\n\nRosenblatt = BUY $25 Price Target\n\nI personally don‚Äôt follow Analysts too closely but it does drive institutional investor buying and helps give you a sanity check.\n\nMy 2024 Price Target is $42-$50 based on their 2024 projected revenue (with current product offerings, this should increase as they offer new products and finalize the bank acquisition).  This is based on a pretty simple comparison to other FinTech's (Square and Paypal) P/S multiples.  Pretty rudimentary so I'd welcome other input.  \n\nThere are obvious risks if multiples come down or if they miss their targets and there is a very high short interest right now but so far they have delivered on all their guidance and growth.\n\nI‚Äôve seen a ton of posts on SoFi trading with a lot of hopes and dreams of a quick hit or WSB pushing it higher and that‚Äôs not why I put my money into SoFi over the past few months.  I‚Äôm an investor not a gambler...but I have been buying some of the dips when it does on sale.\n\nDisclosure:  I‚Äôm long SoFI and it‚Äôs my largest holding.  I continue to buy more on dips and plan to add more in general as they meet their targets and goals, release new products.  I clearly have a vested interest in SoFi going higher but I wanted to share some of the research on the company vs. all the hype that's flying out there right now.", "id": "oal276", "created_utc": 1625011850.0, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Yeah I threw a significant portion of my IRA into it last week for many of the same reasons because under 20 it seems like a complete no-brainer. \n\nPeople also forget that many of us millennials are all saddled with indentured servitude‚Äîoops, I mean student debt‚Äîand have refinanced with SoFi.

They use a threatgraph of all their clients endpoints meta data, storing only meta data (like, this person opened a word document), and have the second largest data footprint on AWS (Netflix is #1...with movies...and insanely huge ops).\n\nSentinelOne has a similar approach.  The platform is slick, has a nice Ui, and is created by israeli cybersecurity experts.  It has less data to work with to correlate attacks (which will change as they add customers and time), but still has amazing potential as they have huge clients (think, one used to be the biggest company in the world...).

I know there is no right answer here but just trying to get a feel from the community. And if I sell I could get into VTO/ VOO or add to my dividend portfolio. Only thing is dividend stocks (as well as everything else) also took a massive hit last drop.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, June 30, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 30, 2021**\n\n*Please Note: Apologies for not sending the Daily Recap out yesterday, I was having technical issues on my end. Thankfully, all the issues were resolved, it's full steam ahead.*\n\nStocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after hitting record highs for many consecutives days. In short, stocks continue to hover near record highs. Market participants are encouraged a stronger-than-expected gain on private payrolls and tempered inflationary fears. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Q2 earnings season and incoming economic data. \n\nToday, ADP‚Äôs June private payroll report showed private payrolls increased faster than expected[.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adp-june-private-payrolls-jobs-market-pandemic-economy-recovery-121542029.html) This underscores the ongoing economic recovery with the US economy reporting its sixth straight monthly increase in employment. Job openings rose by 692,000 versus the 600,000 expected. Consumer confidence has also risen and pointed to Americans' increased propensity to spend, with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index racing to its highest level since February 2020. \n\nDavid Lefkowitz, UBS Global Wealth Management Head of Equities, said ‚ÄúIf you look at what's really been powering the economy and powering the stock market, it's been the fact that there's been so much fiscal stimulus poured into the economy. What's really crucial though is that a lot of that fiscal stimulus has actually not been spent this year. It's sitting on the balance sheets of consumers.\" I totally agree. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. Now that the economy is reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, I expect saving-laden consumers to step out and spend big this summer after enduring social distancing guidelines for more than a year. \n\nToday marks the last trading session of the second quarter of the year, so I thought it would be useful to take a look back at the performance of different assets since March. Year-to-date through Tuesday's close, the S&P 500 has increased 14.3%, the Nasdaq by 12.7% and the Dow by 12%. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a year-to-date peak of 1.77% in March but is on track to end the quarter yielding just under 1.5%. The West Texas intermediate crude oil rebounded by 23% as demand for energy picks up. Digital currencies, on the other hand, had a very difficult quarter, with prices sharply down across the board compared to the beginning of the quarter. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Pending home sales were up 8% in May month-on-month, helping reverse April's 4.4% drop, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. This brought the pending home sales index to 114.7, or the highest reading for the month of May since 2005. \n* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi (DIDI) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company sold 316.8 million shares to raise $4.4 billion, making it one of the largest initial public offerings of a Chinese company in the U.S. since Alibaba's (BABA) $25 billion listing in 2014. Trading began trading at $18, roughly 29% higher than its $14 IPO price, though throughout the session the stock lost most of its IPO gains. \n* General Mills (GIS) said it is raising prices across nearly all its grocery categories by around 7% due to higher costs for ingredients and labor. \n* Ford Motor (F) said it will be forced to cut output across more than a half-dozen U.S. factories in July due to continued pressure from the global shortage in semiconductors.\n* PayPal (PYPL) is intensifying competition with Square (SQ) by launching its own physical card reader to put in stores. While both are undisputed leaders in fin-tech, PYPL has always focused more intensely on peer-to-peer transactions while SQ put more of an emphasis on consumer-to-business transactions.\n* Twitter Inc on Tuesday named Sarah Personette as chief customer officer to oversee the social media platform's global ad sales, global content partnerships and revenue operations. The company has been making a big push to increase revenue lately. \n* **\\*\\*Current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Salesforce (CRM) target raised by Evercore from $290 to $300 at Outperform.
