I don't know what they think that they're doing with all of the conflicting information that some of the Federal Reserve Bank Presidents are putting out there every single chance they get in order to detract from the official statement regarding the direction of short term interest rates.

This should be self evident to everyone who is in that meeting since the Feds dual mandate is low inflation and full employment. Instead what we are hearing is that there could be the need to start raising rates by the end of this year which directly conflicts with chairman Powells belief that interest rates will not likely have to be raised until the back half of 2023.

{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, June 24, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 24, 2021**\n\nThe market edged higher once again, with both the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) driven higher by an incredible rally in technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA), which suffered its worst performance since October 2020 last week continued to recover, pushed higher by a rally in bank and industrial stocks. ‚ÄúReopening stocks‚Äù like cruise lines, hotels, and airlines continue to underperform the market, pressured by the rotation back to growth and concerns that inflation will drive prices in this sector higher. \n\nAfter driving the market higher in the beginning of the year, the last two or so months have seen the market firmly rotate from value and cyclical stocks back to growth and technology stocks due to recent inflationary numbers and labor market disruption that threaten to drive prices for services in this sector higher. However, as I have said previously, while I acknowledge the risk, I am not yet concerned that current inflation will become a persistent threat, at least in the near-term. While that may change and I advise people to be ready in case the Fed is forced to tighten rates sooner-than-expected, I expect value and cyclicals to continue recovering as the US economy continues to reopen. With the stock market‚Äôs great performance in the last 12-14 months and government coronavirus stimulus, I expect savings-laden consumers to spend big this summer after being cooped up indoors for so long. \n\nKeith Lerner, Portfolio and Market Strategist at Truist Securities said, ‚ÄúThe value trade is still intact. It got overcrowded, it got over-loved ... but when we look at the fundamental drivers behind that trade, they're still intact. So the first thing is, context. Yes, they had a big run this year, but they've trailed for about 14 years, so we've had a long underperformance cycle,\" he added. \"And the second part is, why did they underperform for so long is because we had really slow economic growth. And this year and next we expect above-trend economic growth. And the earnings momentum and the earnings leverage for these areas is still positive.\" \n\nLater today, the Fed is set to release the results of its ‚Äústress test‚Äù on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. **If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge if it happens.** \n\nOn Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting \"base effects\" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* **As I was finishing the recap the news is out, the Fed is ending pandemic-era restriction on banks in stock buybacks and dividend increases. This is great news for banks.** More information here [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html)\n* After being under pressure in recent months, shares of Tesla (TSLA) have begun rallying again, with the stock up more than 10% this week alone. \n* Today, Microsoft will unveil the long-awaited sequel to Windows 10.

The vote on the bill was 21-20. The bill will now move on to the House floor and, if passed there, the Senate. The bill is newsworthy but pretty much doomed to fail.\n* Snapchat (SNAP) users globally will get access to Universal Music Group's library of recorded music and content for their own content-making on the social media platform, the companies said Thursday. This move comes as US social media companies across the board continue to implement more ‚ÄúTikTok-like‚Äù features.

In 2019, Fannie and Freddie were finally allowed to retain their capital to the tune of billions.

{"title": "A lot of our retail investors base is in stocks reporting a lot of dark pool activity lately", "selftext": "The SEC is supposed to be \"looking into\" Dark Pools but I had never heard this allegation that \"Hedge funs can short stocks through dark pools without reporting it\" outright. What do you guys think?\n\nThe clip is from \"Making Money with Charles Payne\"\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/o6q1aq/video/cbgg6w6324771/player\n\nIf you haven't heard of dark pool stocks, there‚Äôs a good reason for that. A ‚Äúdark pool‚Äù is a [**private exchange**](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/dark-pool/) used for trading securities in a non-public manner. The dark pools usually aren't available to the general public. They are more frequently used by large investors like hedge funds. \n\n Public stock exchanges like the [**New York Stock Exchange**](https://marketrealist.com/p/nyse-short-restriction-list/) and the [**Nasdaq**](https://marketrealist.com/p/what-is-nasdaq/) are heavily regulated and monitored by the [**SEC**](https://marketrealist.com/p/sec-to-allow-tokenization-of-stocks/). In contrast, dark pools are subject to very little regulation and oversight by any governing organizations. This is why they are also called [**‚Äúdark pools of liquidity.‚Äù**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/060915/pros-and-cons-dark-pools-liquidity.asp) \n\nDark pool investing can save institutional investors money since they aren‚Äôt managed by a large public exchange and therefore avoid exchange fees. Also, the intentions of their trades aren't public until after the trades are executed, which can also offer a price benefit for an institutional investor.\n\nAn institutional investor has a greater chance of selling a large block of a security within a dark pool since it‚Äôs already restricted to large investors.\n\n## Three types of dark pools\n\nDark pools are legal trading exchanges that are kept private. They might also be called [**alternative trading systems (ATS**](https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-a-dark-pool-5188584)) or private trading networks. *Investopedia* reported that as of February 2020, over [**50 dark pools**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp) were registered with the SEC, falling into three different categories.\n\nThe three categories include:\n\n1. **Broker-Dealer-Owned Dark Pool**‚Äîexamples include [**Credit Suisse's**](https://marketrealist.com/2020/07/hanesbrands-gets-boost-credit-suisse-wells-fargo-upgrade/) *CrossFinder*, [**Goldman Sachs's**](https://marketrealist.com/p/goldman-sachs-cheap-global-stocks/) *Sigma X*, and [**Morgan Stanley's**](https://marketrealist.com/p/morgan-stanley-high-conviction-global-stocks/) *MS Pool.*\n2. **Agency Broker or Exchange-Owned Dark Pool**‚Äîexamples include agency broker dark pools *Instinet*, *Liquidnet,* and *ITG Posit.* Some exchange-owned dark pools are those offered by BATS Trading and NYSE Euronext.\n3. **Electronic Market Makers Dark Pools**‚Äîthese dark pools are managed by independent operators.\n\n The privacy of dark pool stock trading can be helpful in keeping details of large trades away from news media coverage. On the public market, these types of trades would likely ‚Äútrigger price overreaction or underreaction,‚Äù according to Corporate Finance Institute.\n\nDark pools enable large trades to be broken into smaller pieces and executed before the price drops. These trades are also called ‚Äúblock trades,‚Äù and they are so large that they have the potential to impact a security‚Äôs price, which is minimized by using the dark pool. This is the main reason dark pools were created.\n\n## Cons of dark pools\n\nCertainly, a major negative aspect of dark pools is their lack of transparency. This leaves the dark pools ‚Äúsusceptible to conflicts of interest by their owners and predatory trading practices by HFT firms,‚Äù according to *Investopedia*.\n\nAnother con of dark pool stocks is that their trades disproportionately benefit institutional investors over small-time retail investors. The off-market prices can be very different from public exchange prices. Institutional investors might be able to sell large holdings of a security on a dark pool before retail investors are aware of this activity.", "id": "o6q1aq", "created_utc": 1624495797.0, "score": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|29|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|27|**Previous DD**|[x](https://v.redd.it/jsgnwzg78b571) [x](https://i.redd.it/6x6jwon2qei61.jpg) [x](https://twitter.com/iqstockalerts1/status/1355114409526398979?s=21) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxrsl5/did_marketbeat_try_to_hurt_the_wish_shortsqueeze/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I couldn‚Äôt think of a reason to dark-pool short a year ago... \n\n\nBut now maybe you don‚Äôt want the apes to smell a short squeeze? üòÇ\n\n\nYes I know squeezes have been around, but I think they have become more concerning in recent times.

The thing to keep in mind with coal though is that they don‚Äôt come online or offline quickly.  So when natural gas became cheap and coal combustion residual regulations became more stringent; all of the coal plants that ran intermittently closed down pertinently.  The coal plants that remain are massive plants that cover base load.  They run damn near 24x7x365.  Plants like TVA Cumberland , Southern Company Plant Bowen, or Duke Energy Gibson - some of the largest coal plants in the country.  The fuel supply for these should be locked in well in advance because these plants invested a lot of money in ash handling and are designed to stay running.\n\nAnyhow, I‚Äôve been been in the environmental field for about 12 years - both designing systems to clean up the waste at closed sites and working on R&D to help the big coal plants like the ones listed above meet more stringent limits on things like mercury and selenium.  All the way down to the selenium treatment in the WW plants; it‚Äôs really though to start and stop a coal unit.  As such, I don‚Äôt expect coal to correlate well with natural gas the way it did when there were hundreds more coal units.\n\nAs a fun side-note, I also don‚Äôt see these plants shutting down until they are replaced with nukes.
