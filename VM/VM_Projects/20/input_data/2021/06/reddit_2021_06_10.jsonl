{"title": "CMPS - The Shroom Boom", "selftext": "Yes, you heard me, shroom boom is back baby. And it will take you to the moon. Obligatory, I’m not a financial advisor and this is not an advice. In fact, I know very little about shrooms and I can’t do day trading as I’m tied up with work usually.\n\nNow, this might be a long game. I’m in it at least for another several months with 100 stock positions. Options are not for the faint of heart as this may go back down before it hits ATH later in the year.\n\nLet’s talk about the company. From the interwebs: “COMPASS Pathways operates as a mental health care company in the United Kingdom and the United States. It develops COMP360, a psilocybin formulation that is in **Phase IIb clinical trial** to treat patients with treatment-resistant depression.” COMP360 received the highly-valuable **FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation.** It has extensive clinical trial pipeline with 21 sites in 10 countries and partners, including King's College London, Stanford University, and more.\n\nThis is so exciting, innit? But wait for the management and partnerships. You’ll lick your chops. Make no mistake, this is not some back-alley, medicating-mind company where founders are using it as a front to get high. CMPS is backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, and arguably the top biotech investor, Joseph Edelman at Perceptive Advisors. They absolutely have some of the most extensive collection of the giants in the pharmaceutical development and regulation domains. And on top of these, it has Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary as a spokesman. Mr. Wonderful has been drumming it up for the last couple of months and if you don’t trust him, then you’re dead to me.\n\nThey're making it known that they're not just a company riding on the hype, but that they are a collection of passionate and world-renowned experts that will drive innovation and advances in the realm of mental healthcare.  They have a solid patent implementation strategy. Just the patents worth billions if it all plays out well.\n\nWhat about the financials, you say. There you go: In September 2020, during Compass's IPO, the offering's total gross proceeds were **$146.6 million**. They have a very health cash at hand, and they expect this to continue to fund all operations into 2023. It's interesting to note that Compass has more cash on hand than all other psychedelic companies combined.  Like many other biotech clinical-stage companies, they are generating $0 in revenue.\n\nCurrently, Compass has a market cap of **$1.5B**. Their main market is depression and a side track of ADD. The bulk of depressive episodes (either major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar) are considered MDD, which are experienced by more than 13 million people in the US annually. TRD is broadly represented by patients who have MDD but don't respond satisfactorily to adequate treatment, but there is no exact definition. It is estimated to make up around 70% of the 13 million people suffering from MDD. That’s a huge market. Based on the growth estimates, I saw someone made a valuation aver **$700B**, which sounds like absolute cockamamy. But who knows, maybe that’s the way. I’m bullish but not that much. It’ll probably be gobbled up by a big pharma well before it reaches there.\n\n***What do I expect from the stock: It established a baseline around $34 with a resistance around $40. Parabolic rise is definitely a possibility, if it breaks, but more likely will take time to reach it’s ATH of $60.***\n\nIt closed over it’s 200 day MA, so the trend is upwards and it’s likely to continue till a new ATH.

Currently Chinese companies are declining new orders due to raw material costs being too high. China also wants to cut production due to environmental/pollution concerns. In order to not bottle growth the Chinese gov needs to keep domestic steel prices low WITHOUT increasing production. Not if but when they slap additional export duties on steel products it will disincentive steel producers from exporting, and this will keep steel in China, increasing domestic supply and pushing domestic steel prices lower. Since the worlds largest steel exporter is no longer exporting, the rest of the world gets fucked when supply gets cut even more, which will cause prices to rise around the globe. Anticipation of this has caused steel futures to become less and less backwardated (when futures prices are lower than spot). Supply is already short and it’s about to get cut even more. \n\nIn order for prices to be sustained there needs to be demand. And steel demand is already back to pre pandemic levels. Cost of capital is low, people need jobs coming out of COVID, the time is now to start projects. Not to mention the massive infrastructure spending across Europe and the trillion dollar minimum bill that will come out of the USA. \n\nAt the end of the day, steel companies are pumping out cash.
