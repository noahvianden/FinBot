The question is, how do we benefit if we didn‚Äôt buy stocks in JNJ, MRNA, NVAX, PFE. Many of these went up 50-500%! In comes Sharps Compliance Corp. SMED. The stock had been up almost as high as 19. At that point, I understand the stock is up over 100% off the lows‚Ä¶.however in the past 2-3 weeks it has fallen all the way down to 12.12!!! Now so people may say, wait the CEO is selling. The CEO owns close to 8% of the company and has been there since 2010. Naturally, if the stock has gone from 8 to 16, I would expect him and some others to sell some. Also, his sales total under 3 million of late, it isn‚Äôt alarming. Of course, we aren‚Äôt thrilled to see it, but at the same time with the way the stock finally been rewarded naturally they should take profits.\n\nSharps Compliance Corp. provides medical, pharmaceutical, and hazardous waste management services in the United States.

At least‚Ä¶. If you want to say that this growth wont be sustainable beyond that, I could agree with you. At the ame time at the moment the market cap is 200 million. They are starting to make serious cash, even if the same growth isn‚Äôt expected it is safe to say the current contracts with facilities should remain in tact for at least a year till renewal? So even if they do not grow at all and make 50 cents or more per share, isn‚Äôt this a great stop?

But i have tried to understand some things from my mistakes and apply them in the future. I will write them out. If you have better advice I will be very grateful to learn.\n\n1. I understood I do not have the appetite to put 20k dollars in one or two large companies and just ride the downs and ups out. No matter how good the companies are.. Yes I completely misunderstood myself honestly.\nI thought Apple Amazon are large companies. Even if they go down. I will hold. I won't sell. I believe in them. Many other things. But when you invest 20k into two companies and see red, as a new investor i freaked out. One moment, i was saying to myself hold. The other moment I am reading reddit posts... Someone saying they are down 5k dollar in apple. Then r/wallstreetbets saying when citadel falls, they will take down apple with them... Reading and hearing all this I just.... Became extremely nervous...\n\n2. I have decided to invest only in etfs for now. I will equally divide my money between VOO, VOOB, VOOG VO VOT VOR... I am not comfortable with the small caps so I will stay away from them..\n\n3. I believed it was possible to earn on the stock market everyday. I did not know anything about the market. I started 2 weeks back and in 2 weeks I made 300 dollars.. I was overjoyed. I became confident and overconfident and finally made this mistake. I know it was lucky streak.\n\n4.i have observed that day trading is extremely difficult to do. That is what I tried with Apple and Amazon. On the day I bought these stocks, for one hour after buying, i was 20 dollars up.. I decided to hold and then...... I will not day trade any more.\n\n5. I learnt that currently there has been a lot of push towards financial institutions rather than tech. That is why I have decided to hedge my bets equally on the etfs i mentioned.\n\n6. I have decided to never yolo everything into company again. Maybe 4 or 5..but never one and keep a balance. For example if a market is down one day and I decided to put 5k in some companies, i will distribute my shares between tech, financial and retail.\n\n7. (This may be wrong) i have seen many days its best not to buy when the market is open. There is a lot of volatility and price may go down. Rapidly.. I have seen many times at close markets fall rapidly. I have tried after hours and pre market trading. I think buying after hours is good. But it always leaves the risk of another crash as market opens. So it may be better to look at pre market sentiments and then buy. But again this is for short term. And i don't want to do it any more.\n\n8. I saw that Apple and Amazon had a kind of flat year. I saw so many news saying Apple and Amazon has same price as aug 2020. However when i look at voo, voob and mid cap etfs.i see they have a slope.it may be small but they still have. I would rather be in a etf like that than wait for apple to make me rich.\n\n9. OH HERE is a the funniest one. I did not know that after selling a stock, you have to wait for 2 days before you can buy again. Due to repeatedly buying and selling, i had good Faith violations. This resulted in me unable to recover my losses on of the days. (i forget what i planned to do).\n\n10. I know you cannot earn money everyday in the market. I became greedy. My initial goal was to earn 50 dollars a month. I became so greedy even after earning 300 dollars.i kept on doing stupid things. Anyway i learnt my lesson. Unfortunately i still have 10k dollars stuck with Amazon. I am just hoping prime day gives me the break i need.\nI just want to get out of this mess.

It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.  \n\n\n  \nMy strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.  \n\n\n  \nHow to use it?  \n\n\n  \n1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.  \n2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).  \n3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line  \n4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line  \n5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line  \n6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).  \n\n\n  \nYou can see example entries here: \\[https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/\\]([https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/))  \n\n\n  \nThis strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years.

{"title": "Velodyne Lidar - looking out the window and finding new ways in addition to short squeezing meme stocks to make WSB greater!", "selftext": "I have been thinking \"what if we start blowing up companies that have very good chances of being incredible investments on their own. PPL would stop paperhanding cause they would know they are doing a good long term investment.\"\nWe can do something good for this world by investing into companies with innovative technology. We can fuel the coming of future tech!\n\nInterested? Hear me out:\n\nHere's an innovative technology company that the stock market analysts consider a good investment for at least the next 12 months. Velodyne Lidar, with a ticker symbol VLDR, which is listed on NASDAQ.\n\nVelodyne Lidar Inc provides smart, powerful lidar solutions for autonomous vehicles, driver assistance, delivery solutions, robotics, navigation, mapping, and more. Lidar, which stands for ‚Äúlight detection and ranging‚Äù, is a technological method used to measure the distance of an object on the earth's surface. This technology is being used in the development of autonomous vehicles (AV). Velodyne is a leader in intellectual property for lidar technologies, with a vast portfolio of patents and more being added all the time. Velodyne's current market cap is $1.92 billion. Velodyne stock has declined more than 40% year-to-date, due to the general market movement since late February and also due to some corporate governance-related issues. However, there have been some positive developments in the company in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Velodyne signed a multi-year agreement with a Russian company *** (i can only post with this censored idk) Systems, which integrates laser equipment for mobile and air applications. \n\nVelodyne also appears to be aiming for the mass market with new sensors that are cheap enough. The company recently unveiled a new sensor called H800, which can see up to 200 meters and can apparently be mass-produced for as little as $500. \n\nAnalysts at Bank of America think that Velodyne is lagging behind their competitor in lidar space, Luminar, in multi-year contracts for automotive/ADAS/AV series production. Velodyne's growing contracts are in areas outside of the auto space, which concerns the firm. In their Q1 2021 earnings report, Velodyne managed to beat revenue estimates but fell short on reported earnings per share. They reported adjusted earnings per share of -$0.14, which is less than the analysts' consensus estimate of -$0.12. They reported revenue of $17.7 million beating the analysts' expectations of $14.9 million. Velodyne had $350.3 million in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet at the end of 2020, during this quarter they have increased the said amount to $383.6 million. \n\nVelodyne had 29 total active multi-year agreements as of May 1 and expects the number will reach 34 by the end of 2021. Analysts from Goldman Sachs target a price of $13.00 per share in the next 12 months with a BUY position. Moreover, analysts at Citigroup also have a BUY position for VLDR with a price target as high as $31.00 per share. Out of 8 analysts, 4 have given it a BUY rating, 3 a HOLD rating, and 1 a SELL rating. The stock sits at $10.12 per share at the moment, which is below the IPO price. Based on analysts' ratings, the forecasted average price of Velodyne's stock in the next 12 months is $20.33, meaning the analysts expect this stock to double in this period of time. The lowest expected price for the stock is $13 while the highest predicted price is $32. \n\nIn short VLDR has been blowing up the past few days and it has a similar chart to meme stocks without even getting meme attention. It's also a really good investment according to experts. What's holding us back? We're not buying options, we simply buy the stock itself!

{"title": "ARRY: Super undervalued solar play with low IV, low premium options!", "selftext": "COMPANY INTRO:\n\nArray, $ARRY is a solar systems company that was founded in 1989 and IPO‚Äôd on October 15, 2020 and currently has a market cap of 2B. Array makes money by selling mounting/tracking systems for big solar production plants that increase efficiency by tracking the sun allowing the panels to absorb more energy. This video from Array shows their systems well:\n\n[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nhDWaT5MjVA](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nhDWaT5MjVA)\n\nGROWTH:\n\nYearly:\n\nRevenue: 2018: $290M 2019: $648M (+123% YoY) 2020: $873M (+35% YoY)\n\nNet income: 2018: -$61M 2019: $40M 2020: $59M (+48% YoY)\n\nQuarterly:\n\nRevenue: Q3 2020: $139M Q4 2020: $180M (+29% QoQ) Q1 2021: $245M (+36% QoQ)\n\nNet Income: Q3 2020: -$7M Q4 2020: -$2M Q1 2021: 3M\n\nGood growth numbers on everything except the latest QoQ net income (will get to later).\n\nNow on to the growth of solar as a sector, specifically on utility production (not residential/personal) because Array‚Äôs consumers are only in the utility sector. Array has 12% market share of the solar tracking systems. The growth of the solar utility sector directly influences the growth of Array. Solar been quickly rising over the last decade as cost of solar technology decreased significantly over that time period. Solar energy is now cheaper to produce than coal, natural gas and nuclear as of 2020. Energy production and utility companies will follow the money and continue to build solar plants to capitalize on this opportunity.\n\nUS Solar Production from Utility (GWh) 2011: 1,800 2012: 4,300 (+138%) 2013: 9,200 (+114%) 2014: 18,300 (+99%) 2015: 26,500 (+45%) 2016: 36,700 (+38%) 2017: 53,000 (+44%) 2018: 66,600 (+26%) 2019: 72,200 (+9%) 2020: 90,900 (+26%) Source: United States Department of Energy\n\nSolar accounted for 2.3% of total energy production in 2020. Obviously plenty of room to grow. Coal, Natural gas and Nuclear combined for 80% of total US electricity production in 2020. Now that solar is the cheapest energy source I expect it to take a large portion of that pie, maybe 25% or more in the next 10-15 years would be my guess. The only thing holding solar back is that the power grids in the US are build only to directly transport electricity from the source to its destination. So there is no element of the grid designed to store electricity. This has not been an issue in the past bc coal, nuclear, natural gas and even hydro produce energy 24/7. Obviously Solar can only produce in the day. The solution to this issue is large, utility scale electric storage. The exact kind provided by Tesla. These storage systems will provide necessary liquidity and versatility to the grid with solar production. The Lithium Ion batteries in these storage systems are rapidly decreasing in price. Prices of Li-Ion batteries have dropped 90% in the last decade. As it becomes more appealing for Tesla and other companies to construct these storage systems and start providing more utility scale electricity storage, more utility companies will invest in solar rigs. It will be more profitable to produce and won‚Äôt be held back by the limitations of old grid infrastructure.\n\nGood video by CNBC on the Grid, Storage systems, and the growth of solar utility production:\n\n[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x3aqWJO4Rso](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=x3aqWJO4Rso)\n\nUNDERVALUED:\n\nIn the first few months after IPO Array‚Äôs price held around the low $40‚Äôs, hitting a high of $53.99. In late January until now the stock has sold off significantly. There are 3 main reasons for this and why the concerns are irrelevant in the long term.\n\n1. Broader market tech/growth sell off due to inflation FUD. I‚Äôm not going to try to predict if inflation will stay, shoot up, or go back down to relatively normal levels but there is one think I know for sure. Tech/growth is cheaper now. Barring hyperinflation and or a depression, this dip gives long term investors a good buying opportunity.\n2. Tax credit changes hurt YoY revenue. ITC is a federal tax credit that allows people or businesses to right off x% of the cost they spent on solar (and directly related related systems/expenses) on their income tax. This % was 30% up to the end of 2019. Then it is lowered to 26% from 2020-2022, then to 22% in 2023, then 2024+ to 0% for residential and 10% for commercial utility and scale. The fact that there is still a 10% tax creditor the foreseeable future is great. And it doesn‚Äôt matter that residential dropped to 0% because Array doesn‚Äôt operate in that market. So why would this Tax Credit be bad? Well going back to the top of the post under Quarterly net income I said I would get to later. Q1 2020 was a great Q for array and their revenue. Revenue or that quarter was $438M, compared to the total yearly revenue in 2019 of $650M. Sense that great quarter. Revenue has dropped significantly. And now because YoY of the last Q report is compared to that breakout Q, it makes this Q and YoY growth look really bad. I believe that Q1 2020 revenue was drastically and temporary inflated because of an element of the ITC tax credit. There is a way that constructing solar systems can grab on and hold on to the higher 30% credit from 2019 even if they don‚Äôt finish construction before 2020. It is called safe haven. Basically if construction is started and there is a continuous effort made to complete construction and as long as that construction is finished within 4 years, the business will receive the 30% tax credit. In this quarters earnings report, when referring to the 44% decrease in YoY revenue, Array‚Äôs CEO said ‚ÄúResults were lower to last year because of the unseasonably high high volume of shipments we had in the first Q 2020 to consumers that were safe harboring tracker systems in connection with the ITC step down‚Äù So it seems clear that Array was flooded with orders late 2019 to take advantage of the safe harbor and those revenues showed up on Q1 2020 financials. So even though the YoY revenue from last earnings was bad I believe that the order flow Array is getting was inflated in Q1 2020 and is now deflated because of all the businesses that would be buying trackers now, but bought them earlier because they wanted the better tax credits. I can see this cycle of inflated and deflated order flow/revenue relative to the decreases in ITC tax credits continue until 2024 when the credit stabilizes at 10%. I believe bad YoY data is just a distraction from great long term growth and creates a great buying opportunity.\n3. Supply chain FUD and one time stock based compensation hurt profits. Rapid increase in the price of raw materials, goods and even cost of transporting those goods going up. Supply chain FUD has stacked on top of inflation FUD sense late February until last earnings and has caused a substantial sell off in Array stock. This Supply chain FUD was realized in last quarters earnings (Q1 2021) when profitably/margins sank because cost of goods shot through the roof. ‚ÄúThis industry (solar tracking) is contending with increase in steel and shipping costs that are unprecedented in both magnitude and the rate of change.‚Äù - Jim Fusaro, Array CEO in Q1 2021 report. YoY the cost of steel has more than doubled Steel represents the almost half of Array‚Äôs cost of goods sold so it‚Äôs extreme increase in price has an large impact on the bottom line. Shipping costs have also shot up significantly and have the same effect on the bottom line. Even though revenue in Q1 2020 was $438M and revenue Q1 2021 was $246M, operating costs were higher in this Q large due to one time expense that come with becoming a public company. This includes increase in equity based compensation and costs related to common stock. This is simply a short term expense that negatively impacted this Q earnings and will have no further impact on profits/margins. Array is taking action to secure long term contracts with freight providers and fixing commodity prices with suppliers. This action from array combined with the fact that ridiculous prices of shipping and materials will drop in the next year or two as supply meets demand thanks to capitalism.
