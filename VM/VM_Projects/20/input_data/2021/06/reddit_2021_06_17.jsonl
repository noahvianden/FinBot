Prior to that, she was chief customer officer at Corelle Brands.\n\nPrior to Corelle, Ms. Varni was chief customer officer at Arhaus Furniture. Previously at Tempur Sealy International, she was senior vice president of marketing for Tempur Sealy Brands.\"\n\n- Bearish:\n- \"Pano Anthos, Director, reported a sale of 17,241 shares in Purple Innovation (PRPL) on Jun 07, 2021, for $500,927. Following the Form 4 filing with the SEC, Anthos owns 9,033 shares of the company, which have a market value of $252,292 as of the prior-day closing price.\n\nIn the 90 days prior to the date of this filing, there have been 12 insider transactions reported to the SEC for Purple Innovation.\"\n\nPersonally I buy a lot of pillows, although I invested on this on a whim I quite like the lineup of products they offer. If they ship to the UK I would consider ordering some myself. Pillows are something I buy quite frequently either for myself or my girlfriend.

By comparison, the current RSI reading of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) is 56.0. A bullish investor could look at PRPL's 28.7 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side.\"\n\nWe have previously seen a bounce at these levels after March. I'm hoping to see this bounce happen again. \n\nOngoing market volatility may be an opportunity to buy PRPL at a good price. Make sure you clearly understand any positions you are entering. \n \nPRPL could soar high as many institutional investors are aggressively trading PRPL backwards and forwards amongst themselves. Be careful to set your exit target, and stop losses if it soars - in order to not get caught out on a crash.\n \n- Institutional investors shares/value:\nColiseum Capital Management Llc\t15.5 M\t492 M\nFmr Llc\t8.2 M\t260 M\nWasatch Advisors Inc\t5.6 M\t178.4 M\nCapital Research Global Investors\t2.8 M\t88.4 M\nBlackrock Inc\t2.7 M\t85.4 M\nVanguard Group Inc\t2.4 M\t75.1 M\nHawk Ridge Capital Management Lp\t1.7 M\t55.2 M\n\nPurple is a mid-cap company with a current market cap of 1.93B. \nThe company has Profit Margin (PM) of 0.58 %, meaning that even a very small decline in it's revenue will erase profits resulting in a net loss. This is way below average. Similarly, it shows Operating Margin (OM) of 10.98 %, which suggests for every 100 dollars of sales, it generated a net operating income of 0.11.\n\nThe entity has return on total asset (ROA) of 12.67 % which means that it generated profit of $12.67 on every $100 spent on assets. This is normal in comparison to the sector average. Similarly, it shows return on stockholders equity (ROE) of 13.99 %, it created $13.99 for $100 dollars invested by stockholders. \n\n- Recent insider trading activity:\n\nPano Anthos 2 days ago \n- Sale by Pano Anthos of 799 shares of Purple Innovation\t\nVarni Patrice Ann over two weeks ago \n- Acquisition by Varni Patrice Ann of 12856 shares of Purple Innovation subject to Rule 16b-3\t\nGary DiCamillo over two weeks ago \n- Acquisition by Gary DiCamillo of 3308 shares of Purple Innovation subject to Rule 16b-3\t\nGary Kiedaisch over three weeks ago \n- Acquisition by Gary Kiedaisch of 2969 shares of Purple Innovation subject to Rule 16b-3\t\nGary Kiedaisch over two months ago \n- Purchase by Gary Kiedaisch of 5000 shares of Purple Innovation\t\nColiseum Capital Management Llc over three months ago \n- Exercise or conversion by Coliseum Capital Management Llc of 5782500 shares of Purple Innovation subject to Rule 16b-3\t\nCasey McGarvey over three months ago \n- Conversion by Casey McGarvey of 55000 shares of Purple Innovation\t\nCasey McGarvey over three months ago \n- Conversion by Casey McGarvey of 55000 shares of Purple Innovation\t\nPano Anthos over three months ago  \n- Bona fide gift to Pano Anthos of 2000 shares of Purple Innovation subject to Section 16\t\nCasey McGarvey over three months ago  \n- Bona fide gift to Casey McGarvey of 22258 shares of Purple Innovation subject to Section 16\t\nZepf Paul J over six months ago \n- Acquisition by Zepf Paul J of 141 shares of Purple Innovation subject to Rule 16b-3\t\nPano Anthos over six months ago \n- Sale by Pano Anthos of 8752 shares of Purple Innovation\n\nGeneral research:\n- PRPL closed strong in 2020, showing top and bottom line growth\n\n- However the market reacted negatively, despite predicted double digit revenue growth in the first quarter. \n\n- PRPL has grown both its revenue and operating margin since its IPO in 2018. From $200M to $648M in 2020. Operating margin has improved from negative to positive territory, to 5.7% at present.\n\n- During 2020 people upgraded their living conditions at home, this resulted in a 2020 net revenue increasing 51% YoY to $649M. Gross margin also improved from 44.1% in 2019 to 47% in 2020 due to lower input costs.\n\n- 2020 operating expense dropped to 36.1%, this caused a 339% YoY increase in operating income, to $71.2 million. This is stellar performance.\n\n- Management pivoted the company well during the pandemic, as last year direct-to-consumer revenue increased by 83%, and wholesale revenue still increased slightly.\n\n- The pandemic broadened it's consumer base. Management plans to increase this momentum by expanding its retail and online presence:\n\"With our additional manufacturing capacity coming online, we intend to lean into accelerated wholesale door growth. Our current plan is to add approximately 1,500 new doors in 2021, with a focus on both expanding our footprint with existing partners as well as launching with additional leading regional furniture players.\n\nNow to launching a new e-commerce platform. We have been developing the new design and platform for much of 2020. In order to capitalize on immediate opportunities during the stay-at-home fuel demand, we deferred some of the work into this quarter.\"\n\n- Analysts are projecting strong earnings growth for the next two years, with 14% and 28% EPS growth estimates for 2021 and 2022.\n\nSummary:\nPurple has been a good investment over the past year, due to rapid consumer adoption of its products. Management continues to invest in growth and expand their consumer reach. This is supported by growth seen before the Pandemic. The recent dip is a good buying oppurtunity. As always, do your own DD. I'm just an autistic woman who writes DD's when I take extra adderall. \n\nI will expand and edit this DD as I do more research, but I decided to post it in it's current state as there has been a good dip just now following upwards movement. It's near the price I entered at (but above), but seems to be rebounding just now.", "id": "o264zb", "created_utc": 1623959620.0, "score": 51, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|14|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|409|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ll2fol/im_going_to_place_puts_on_robinhoods_ipo/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n40avv/hig_quick_adderall_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ntqwp7/wdc_western_digital_is_being_driven_up_by_chia/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o262gx/prpl_a_dd_i_wrote_on_adderall/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o264zb/prpl_a_dd_i_wrote_on_adderall/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nnonny/kopn_dd_i_wrote_on_adderall/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nnoylc/ever_had_koss_portapros_koss_dd/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsyqj1/mega_dd_wdc_western_digital_is_being_driven_up_by/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nu8axj/wdc_western_digital_dd_part_2/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwnysp/amat_dd_and_why_semiconductor_stocks_are_a_great/) \n**Account Age**|5 years ago|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I wrote a DD today and mods took it down aftwr 10 mins cuz some people complained about me pumping and dumping.
