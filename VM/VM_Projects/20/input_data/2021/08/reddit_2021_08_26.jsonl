The final day for the bill to pass is set on September 27th so expect it to pass officially and written into law from now until then. The thing is that big gas and oil isn't getting into the RNG business. They don't want to just yet. They need RNG in order to meet the EPA regulations of bio-fuels mixtures, but realize that environmental regulations are only going to tighten. While the EPA is recommending to lower the mandated amount of bio-fuel mixed for the near future, because of a production slump due to COVID, it will rise again. What a better time to invest in RNG? It is a emerging market, but demand for most fuel is stagnant because of COVID's effect on travel.\n\nThe market is obviously growing, but why $CLNE?

Avepoint (AVPT) from 16.5 to below 9.66 as of writing.\n\nAvepoint has been in business for 20 years and is the largest independent software vendor of SaaS solutions to migrate, manage and protect data in Microsoft 365. It has offices in the US, Canada, Australia, South Africa, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland, Japan, Singapore, and China.\n\n2 weeks ago Avepoint reported their Q2 earnings. They managed to beat the estimates once again:\n\n· Total Revenue of $45.3 million, up 38% year-over-year\n\n· SaaS Revenue of $20.6 million, up 76% year-over-year\n\n· Non-GAAP Operating Income of $3.3 million;\n\nYou would expect a stock price to go up when it beats earnings, especially, if it trades below its former net asset value (NAV). Well unfortunately (or fortunately, if you are trying to accumulate) the stock went South together with all the other de-spac companies after their mergers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[I was told crayons are important](https://preview.redd.it/js27eld66rj71.png?width=987&format=png&auto=webp&s=231fdef646a3f60234b76de64ce126a635b095d4)\n\nThey expect further growth for the Q3: total revenues between $51.5 and $53.5 million and annual 2021 revenues of about $200 million. That means they are trading at just 8.8 P/S of 2021 with an annual growth of 38%. And if we project at least a 30% until 2025, that would mean their revenues would reach $571 million. Given that they are a SAAS company, that sounds excellent and way better than industry average.\n\nGiven that their business is based on a long term relationship with Microsoft, as Azure is growing, AvePoint will continue to grow as well. Therefore, Avepoint should be considered a long term investment. It’s market capitalization of less than 2 billion does bring volatility, however, the future outlook is green.\n\nThere are 5 analyst [ratings](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=AVPT) and all of them are a \"BUY\". They have an average price target of $15 per share and the highest price target was given by Goldman Sachs ($17).\n\nUnlike PLTR, where insiders have been selling heavily, AVPT CEO just last week purchased additionally $936k worth of shares himself. That shows strong conviction in the company and that he believes the shares are undervalued.\n\n[https://sec.report/Document/0001437749-21-020544/](https://sec.report/Document/0001437749-21-020544/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I am long AVPT and I have 360 shares having added most over the past month.", "id": "pc6l93", "created_utc": 1630006005.0, "score": 77, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|19|**First Seen In WSB**|8 months ago\n**Total Comments**|1070|**Previous DD**|[x](https://v.redd.it/y5oe3q0as0971) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pc4chk/avpt_will_fly_again/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pc4jfl/avpt_will_fly_again/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pc4li3/avepoint_avpt_will_fly_once_again/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pc6l93/avpt_will_fly_again/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/clint1reid, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You merely adopted the SPAC.
