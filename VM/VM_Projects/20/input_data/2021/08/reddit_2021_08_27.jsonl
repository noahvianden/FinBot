{"title": "AUPH: Best treatment against Lupus nephritis, undervalued, buyout candidate and high level of short interest", "selftext": "As I am long (and kinda YOLO) on this stock, I think it deserves a small DD, first one for me, hope you will like it!\n\nAurinia Pharmaceuticals is a biotech company which has a drug against Lupus Nephritis\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The** **basics** \n\n- First FDA-approved oral therapy for lupus nephritis. Only competitor is Benlysta from GSK, less efficient, injection only (more painful for the patient)\n\n- The Lupus Foundation of America estimates 1.5 million Americans have lupus, Studies have shown that over time up to 60% of lupus patients will develop lupus nephritis, including over half of children with lupus.\n\n- 65k annual revenue is expected per lupus nephritis patient.\n\n- AUPH has no debt and, even better, 400 millions in cash.\n\n- [Good market penetration so far](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aurinia-reports-second-quarter-six-200500062.html) (100 patients Q1, 400 Q2) and guidance provided for the end of the year (40-50 millions) with great expectations for the next years (200 in 2022, 400 in 2023, sales peak at 1.5 billions) \n\n- Partnership with Otsuka for the Europe / Japan markets ( [up to 20% of the sales + 100 millions cash](https://biopharmajournal.com/2021/02/05/aurinia-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaqauph-enters-commercialization-agreement-with-otsuka-pharmaceuticals-for-voclosporin/) )\n\n- Analysts consensus is at 28+, buyout above 45.\n\nPre Q2, the question was to know if they would be able to sell it and the stock was really pressured because of that (low after Q1 at 10, then 3 top at 14), now we know it is most likely the case and that's why the SP is getting higher (+50% in the past month), institutions are buying ([Morgan Stanley went from 300k to 3 millions shares for example](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-auph-insider-buying-and-selling-2021-08-2-3/)) and it seems unlikely it will ever go back below 14. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/KeZeibw.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/nGyc3pm.png\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The** **catalysts**\n\n- Aurinia 2 (3 years / 36 months studies) will be released by end of the year, knowing nothing bad was detected at 33 months, that should validate it as SOC (Standard of Care).\n\n- Europe approval process has been started in June, with an expected approval next year.\n\n- They just bought [2 new drugs for their pipeline which could synergize well with Lupkynis](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aurinia-acquires-novel-pipeline-assets-100500497.html).\n\n- Q3 results early November should validate the trend of sales. \n\n- Aurinia sued Sun Pharmaceuticals over pattern infringement in December 2020, this should be resolved in a near future and bring more liquidity to the company. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The** **buyout**\n\nAll of that just if the company goes by itself. But the cherry on top would be to get bought out by one of the Big Pharm and it seems likely to happen in the next months. In this case, we should expect at least a 150/200% premium.\n\n- AUPH delisted itself from the Toronto exchange, officially because only 6% of the shares traded were traded there. But it also simplifies the process of being bought out. \n\n-  First rumors back in May / June (Pfizer, GSK, AstraZeneca...) \n\n- M&A season started earlier this week with [TRIL / Pfizer](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210823005192/en/Pfizer-to-Acquire-Trillium-Therapeutics-Inc.), AUPH is one of the best candidate for the big pharmas. \n\n- A weird Press Release appeared yesterday morning on [different websites](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/aurinia-pharmaceuticals-finalizes-acquisition-agreement-with-leading-pharma-giant-2021-08-26), likely fake or at least released to early, about a 35+ acquisition by a big pharma, it was later asked to be removed from Benzinga (but not denied) \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The** **short** **interest**\n\nSince the FDA Approval in Jan 2021, the stock has been pressured by the shorts. Honestly, it was not dumb from them because even with an approved drug, there are LOT of reason a biotech can fail. \n\nFrom 5 millions post approval, they went up to 16 millions pre Q2 results, and had to add another million post Q2 to keep the SP low. We talk about 17.6 millions shares, about 12% of the float!! With the current run (30% in one week), 99% of the shorts are already in the red. \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ZXcuYZC.png\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPositions (60% of my portfolio, about 18k total): \n\n- 325 shares (+220 on my 401k)\n\n- 14 calls (mostly 15/17C Jan 22) \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/2c3Do1B.png\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/YLZ3DN7.png", "id": "pcmw3k", "created_utc": 1630069312.0, "score": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "It's never lupus.\n\nBut really, sounds promising!", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is looking really, really good\n\nAn oral therapy that works better than its existing counterpart and only other competition?
