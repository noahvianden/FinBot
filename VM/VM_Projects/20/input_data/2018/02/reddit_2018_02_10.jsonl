AMD has never been competitive with either NVDA or INTC on the consumer facing product lines for almost a decade. Value? Maybe. But that's by choice. INTC could care less about posting 20-30% margins on their low end products. HOWEVER, AMD's latest servers prove to be very promising. The caveat, of course, is INTC's insane margins.

Alpha Go beat the top Go player in a game that was thought to be impossible for a computer to beat due to the number of possibilities.  Alpha Zero took it another step further, they built something that self taught itself to be the top Go player in 72 hours.  Let that sink in.  Or let's discuss video games.  I forgot who maybe it was DeepMind but they created an AI player for Dota 2 and beat one of the professional players at the game.  Facebook has been working on an OpenAI platform for games, they were looking into Starcraft if I remember correctly.  What do games like Starcraft and Dota 2 have in common?  An even greater set of strategic possibilities, not just putting a black and white stone on a game board.\n\nThe modern day gold rush is AI/machine learning and it is applicable to ANYTHING.  Imagine building a Alpha Zero for trading, autonomous cars.  Alexa has been a massive success for Amazon.  Imagine taking alexa to the next level?  How about personalized bots like the one in the movie Her?  Now how about we pair that with virtual reality or augmented reality and create something like Joi in Blade Runner?
