That's not a terrible thing given most other stores are declining (due mostly to Amazon), but this is something the market values extremely highly. Revenue stagnation isn't death, but it's also not a great sign. This is something markets like to see increase by double digits year over year. \n\nCurrent PE ratio: WMT is at the top of the industry average for this valuation currently sitting at 29. Costco is just below 30, Target is at 16. To see WMT take off from here and explode past 30 would signal that the industry sees potential in WMT beyond what other similar stores offer (which is possible given their push for online sales). \n\nAll that being said, I don't expect this to go up another 30-40% this year, but I do see this easily rising back to prior highs given that nothing has drastically changed and they're still a healthy company. \n\nConclusion: I'm a buy but with optimistic price target of $100 in the next 2 or 3 months to reach near former highs.

{"title": "Let's talk food delivery", "selftext": "Here at WSB, we're always chasing that next hit secular growth story. Well, the answer to the question you didn't ask is **food delivery.** In 2017, it grew 50% with no signs of slowing down. The more food is delivered, the cheaper delivery becomes, the more people use it, etc. It's the Amazon flywheel all over again. \n\nThe question becomes: How to benefit from this trend? I think this is fantastic for the fast food giants that didn't have delivery before. MCD, YUM, QSR, all of which are primed to pump food out at volume and trade at very reasonable valuations. Delivery was a huge boon to the pizza industry, and it will be an even bigger boon to fast food companies that can grow without doing an ounce of CapEx to build out a delivery network. I think going long these companies is the best play in this space, since there is almost no downside at these valuations, and vast upside. I'm especially bullish on MCD since they have been killing it by every single metric.\n\nThe other compelling play is to long GRUB. These guys have been growing at 30%, just posted monstrously good user growth numbers(77% increase!!), and also signed a deal with YUM, which is obviously a huge deal. I think GRUB is fantastic and going to grow. According to McKinsey, 80% of users who sign up with a delivery app stick with it, and this creates very important winner-take-all effects.
