I understand there's is a fair amount of hype surrounding it, I've even heard their enthusiasts referred to as a cult on this forum.  I for one discovered MU through a screener. I saw that they had a forward PE of 6, analysts continually raising expectations, a huge demand and growing potential for their products in everything from AI to automotive, tons of cash, very little debt, and profit margins of 25%.  Since I bought that stock, it's gone up about 15% and it's still soooo undervalued. I mean Amazon has a p/e of like 1400... the best investment banks in the world average with p/e's of around 20. So where does all of the criticism come from? Is it lodged in something real that I'm just not seeing ? Or are people just bitter that they didn't buy the dip or get in a month ago?  How can you be upset at a company for having amazing fundamentals with huge growth that has made a ton of people some really easy money? \nAnyways, I really would love to hear some actual criticisms in regards to why it might be overvalued or unattractive to some. I have yet to hear any actual points. Just stupid comments about the people who own it.

Energy companies don't trade at nearly as high a multiple as, say, a decent software company. This is because different industries have different potential for earnings growth. An oil company will be heavily followed by analysts, its revenue is predictable and closely linked to readily available information like crude oil prices, therefore there are fewer surprises and fewer reasons to pay a premium for such a company. Amazon trades at such a high multiple because of its unique position as the leader in e- commerce. Also because of the numerous ventures the company is exploring that investors believe have potential for revenue and earnings growth. \n\nPE ratio can be used to get an idea for investor sentiment; bullish or optimistic for high PE ratio, bearish or doubtful for low PE. \n\nSometimes a company will have a PE ratio that simply seems too high and this can be attributed to the fact that the market decides what it should be. Increased demand results in increased prices and this is true for stocks as well. Netflix has a PE ratio of 266. It's uncertain at this time how the company will live up to such a high premium especially since they are spending increasing amounts on creating original content. However, the fact that this stock just keeps going up  increases the demand for it which sends the share price up which increases demands, so on until something gives. \n\nOf course, sometimes, a low PE is just that; an indication that the company is undervalued. \n\nIn short, a PE ratio is a nuanced thing. It is an important piece of the puzzle for understanding an investment but alone it is not enough. Look at the company's other numbers and business prospects to determine if a PE is too high or low.
