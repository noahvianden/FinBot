My friend and I created a system that, with your permission, can measure your portfolio and meta analytics on Tiingo then use that to find candidates to place at funds. I've done this before in the past successfully, and my friend specializes in this. This is optional.\n4. Join game!

I gave him the standard response that it contained a link to his personal site, and while looking over his site while I was responding to him, I started digging through the navigation, running some scans on some stocks and was pleasantly surprised with the product he made.\n\nMore impressive was that he made it all from scratch. Having previously worked at a hedge fund himself, Wittilyfun had a lot of quant knowledge to share, and he did it through tiingo.\n\nHis site is free to use, there are some minor limitations on the free side such as you can only have five custom screens saved.\n\nNaturally everything provided here to us is free with no obligations to pay anything.\n\nHe will not blow his own horn, so I will do it for him:\n\nModern Trader magazine awarded tiingo most disruptive fintech company in 2015!\n\nAlso, the following educational institutions use [tiingo.com](https://tiingo.com) for their portfolio challenges:\n\n\\- Tennessee Tech\n\n\\- University of Wisconsin\n\n\\- University of Texas\n\n\\- McGill University\n\n\\- Purdue University\n\nMy coffee is getting cold so I am not going to type out this whole list, if you are interested, here it is: [https://i.imgur.com/JUnQ0BR.png](https://i.imgur.com/JUnQ0BR.png)\n\nIf you like podcasts on itunes, this overachieving ass also has the top podcast there:\n\n[https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tiingo\\-investing\\-how\\-to\\-create\\-better\\-investment\\-retirement/id972388816?mt=2](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tiingo-investing-how-to-create-better-investment-retirement/id972388816?mt=2)\n\nIf anybody has questions, feel free to ask!", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the really kind words /u/StockJock-e .
