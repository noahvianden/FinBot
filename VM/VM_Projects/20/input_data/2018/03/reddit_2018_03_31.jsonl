The US wants to see Qualcomm remain an independent US firm -- it has no ability to ensure that Qualcomm remains a -competitive- global firm. Qualcomm does indeed have a number of 5g patents, but I refer you to examples like Tivo -- when you are making your money from royalty streams vs. actual product innovation, your growth is linked to the growth of other corporations. note I'm not saying QCOM is going bankrupt..just that they are playing in a space which is going to be a brutal knife fight over the next few years. \n\nAs for why Micron is a better play on IOT/cloud -- every computing device has a couple key elements for it to work using current compute models: a processor(s), memory and some variable amount of storage. Every single computing thing from a solar powered calculator to an automated self driving vehicle has these components. So any IOT type device will be sourcing from/giving money to to manufacturers of these 3 components.\n\nThe processor market (see intel) has fractured with specialty chips (ARM/NVDA) creating customized processors specific to the task vs. buying intel/AMD classic 8086 architecture. Its not clear at all that Intel can win/dominate this space (see bad decisions re: ARM). \n\nThe storage market is undergoing a phase shift from classic hard drives (spinning discs) to SSDs/flash. Due to SSD/flash relative insensitivity to vibration, and their smaller form factor their deployment can go forward in places where the market simply didn't exist before (cars). Demand here is huge but there are still a number of players in this space (Samsung dominates) - making SSD although a huge market opportunity, highly likely to be subject to the cyclicality of past semi conductor boom/busts.\n\nFinally there is memory, and memory is where things are different -- historically there were dozens of memory manufacturers in the market place propped up by various governments (Japan/Korea/Taiwan), over time however the majority of these have gone bankrupt/been bought out to the point where memory now exists as an oligopoly -- Samsung, Hynix and Micron. Further -- memory is memory, while it comes in different form factors and speeds, random access memory is a compute standard.  Fab plants to produce dram are hugely expensive to build (billions) and China is the last government trying to create its own semiconductor industry since most of the IP in this space is tightly locked down. \n\nThis means that we are in a \"special\" situation where just as the market for computing device is about to go parabolic (IOT), the supply for additional memory is relatively constrained. [supply growth is around 20%/year where arguably demand growth due to IOT is well in excess of that]\n\nFor micron (2/3 of revenue == memory) this means huge cash flow until the oligopoly breaks down. The problem/opportunity with Micron is that there is a 30 year+ history of semiconductor cycles which has most/many people believing that additional supply (whether its from Samsung/Hynix or China) will exceed market demand creating a collapse in prices and thereby margins. \n\nIf you buy the IOT story, this collapse is not highly probable since market demand is so high -- as prices fall, new applications/use cases will be developed to absorb supply.
