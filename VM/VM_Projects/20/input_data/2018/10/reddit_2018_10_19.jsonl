Since most of this sub seems to be poor assholes getting more poor by the day, you might think amazon earnings are outside your price range.  That’s where you are wrong.  Put that IV to work for you.\n\nRight now you can put on a butterfly call spread like this for ~$900 cost (your max loss will be your cost).  $1780c x1, $1840c x-2, $1900c x1.  Buy the wings, sell the middle. \n\nThe price might vary slightly depending on where you want to center the trade, I also won’t be putting a play like this on until next Wednesday so I can get a better idea of where the price might be after er (going to price in a 3-4% move up).  Cost might go up by then but it should be negligibly.\n\nPoint is with a spread of +\\- $60 off the center, and a cost of under a grand, you are profitable up to a share price $50 or so off your center strike. \n\nAt expiration for the example: under $1780, you lose it all.  Over $1900 you lose it all. $1840 is max profit although you will never get the max (closing out for $6k) but 5k is a real possibility if the price is $1840 like an hour before market close.  The further from $1840 or the center strike, the less you make until you hit the outside wings and it’s all gone.\n\nPretty easy stuff. Now $30 butterfly spreads are going for like 200-250. You can put on 4 and spread those mother fuckers out of you don’t know where the price is going. Getting something back is more likely but your max profit is way lower.
