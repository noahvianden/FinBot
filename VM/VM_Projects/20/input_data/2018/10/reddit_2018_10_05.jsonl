They're absolutely are people making 20-50k a month day trading, and it is possible to make a living doing it.    \n\nTo answer why are they peddling stock advice?  Well the easy answer is its substantial income and its reliable and consistent.    Tim Sykes is a pretty good example.   While he does give out a ton of free information, a vast majority of his videos are just a sales pitch for his courses, books, seminars, webinars etc.   Hes definitely pitching what sounds like a get rich quick scheme.   I follow him on twitter, so I do know there really are students posting gains and that at least seems real. \n\nI very much like [Zozo's stock watch](https://www.youtube.com/user/Landm19).  He gives a really good breakdown of the market,  the indices, stocks to watch, day trades, swing trades etc.   He does have a trading program and he does talk about it, but the point of his videos  is to provide info and build a following.    I'm sure hed be making that video for his regular chat group members anyway, it's just another way to make money off of something hes already doing for free. I'm up really early and he posts his next day stocks to watch video at night, so it's the only one that's always up before I wake up.  \n\nBoiler room trading is pretty good too.  Conor is a good dude  and gives out a ton of info.  He has a paid and free trade chat.  Im in his free chat everyday.  I still haven't joined the paid version, but I will soon.   \n\n\nAs for why isnt there a day trader as big as Warren buffet, its scalability.    Its WAY easier to day trade on smaller volume.   Youd never be able to scale it up to the size of the big wall street money managers managing Billions.    For example,  if you see a stock breaking, you can jump on and get a few hundred or a few thousand shares, ride the wave and get out.  If you were trying to buy and/or sell tens or hundreds of thousands or even millions of shares, youd have a VERY hard time getting filled.

This accounts for a large amount of buying pressure in some big name stocks and may allow selling pressure to drive prices down and could potentially cascade downwards (margin call dominoes). It was one of the main factors in the crash that caused the great depression. Buybacks were outlawed after the depression but since then the regulations have been softened, and here we are with the longest lasting bull market in US history with bloated SPs that could potentially deflate up to 90% like that great crash in 29'.\n\nBut that's just a worse case scenario and probably won't happen until next year so get it while the getting is good, but keep an eye out.

There doesn't seems to be the irrational exuberance of the early 2000s. But we also have stagnated wage growth with nearly full employment, quantitative tightening, and protectionist trade policies.
