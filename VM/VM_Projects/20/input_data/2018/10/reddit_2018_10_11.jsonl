The VIX is now at 23. A very big jump +40% yesterday. The VIX is literally based on the prices of options. \n\n**So what this higher VIX number really means is that option prices are now much more expensive than they were before.**\n\nWhether you think the market will recover back up, or you think it will keep falling, and you have some creative plan to trade options to take advantage of that move, note how expensive options are now. **You could guess the direction of the market right the rest of the week but the now higher option prices can be *too high* to cover the amount the market will move before the expiration = leaving little or no room to profit. Hard to get to breakeven with these prices, even when you get the direction right.**\n\nIf you're going to try options this week, now more than ever is the time to finally learn about how implied volatility pricing works.\n\nPersonally:\n1) I am going to watch the market a bit before making any moves. Seen too many dumb plays trying to buy a dip on something that looks cheap then it keeps falling. Or other traders assuming this the big crash they always say needs to be coming that's been building for a while, buying puts on everything, only to see the market stop falling and recover in a matter of days or weeks. No ones knows how this week will end. I don't need to catch the exact bottom. I'm ok waiting to see a turn in direction and the speed of recovery before buying again. \n\n2) I am also going to spend some time today and rest of the week hunting for deals in less popular names. Everyone knows about UVXY, SPY, MSFT and MU etc. These are the types of securities with the worst highest option prices now. And they are the least volatile. You can still make money on them, but it's harder than other places in the market right now. I will be looking further into the future and lower in the money than I usually do. I will also be looking at different dates and calendar spreads. \n\n3) I don't usually trade credit spreads or ratio spreads. But at these prices I might be. Especially in shit stocks with crazy high option pries.\n\nTo those bros down big, we feel your pain. Be careful about doubling down. Actually be careful about making any big rushed moves after hard losses trying to recover back up without thinking twice and doing your due diligence. Shit be expensive and desperation is not a good head space to rush things in. If you suffered from a big move against you or missed out big gains this week you almost bought beforehand, we know what that's like. You can recover from losses but be open and honest about timeframes, things fall fast and it might take longer for the gains to build back up. Great time to learn about different trading strategies under different market conditions. \n\nFor other guys thinking to take what's left in the account take a break from this stuff for a while or leave this game entirely, that's cool too, active trading for FDs is mostly luck and not a long term game, no judging, enjoy your peace of mind, you will be missed, F for respect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "That's actually a post that makes sense.
