If short term losses in TSLA would affect your standard of living or ability to pay bills, or put your retirement plans in jeopardy, that's probably a sign that one's exposure to the stock is too high.  **(2)** Options are gambling and likely stupid, given the randomness of TSLA and the unpredictability of events like Elon tweets.  **(3)** Margin is dangerous, for similar reasons as (2).", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "Here are my thoughts for what their worth:  There is a theory that Elon’s recent tweets were not completely erratic and were out of frustration for the SEC pursuing the model 3 production goals case.
