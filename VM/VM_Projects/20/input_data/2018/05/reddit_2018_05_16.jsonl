You'll still be up 25%. Even if it goes up only 75% and drops to half, you'll be down 12.5% temporarily but the market will recover again soon and you'd be back up. Diversifying and rebalancing regularly can also take a lot of the pain out of the collapse, as rebalancing locks in some of your stock gains into bonds during the rise, and then makes you increase your stock allocation during the collapse in advance of the recovery.

{"title": "I've been searching for an answer from the internet but can't quite figure out why Tesla has such a high inventory rate", "selftext": "First thing first, I am not an analyst or an expert in doing DD. Investing is my hobby and loosing money is my addiction so be easy on me (which I don't expect to be the case in this sub). Anyway, here goes.\n\nTesla has been claiming that they have a hard time keeping up with productions and meeting demand. However, its balance sheet doesn't speak the same thing to me. Compared to F and GM, Tesla has extremely high inventory/sale ratio in Q1 2018:\n\nTSLA: 0.70 = $2.57B/$3.41B \n\nGM: 0.32 = $11.46B/$36.1B\n\nF: 0.07 = $10.28B/$156.78B\n\nAt first, I thought since Tesla includes SolarCity in the equation, a chunk of it could come from SolarCity. Since merging, they don’t breakout the detail anymore so it is hard to find the true inventory of just cars. But on the last available 10-K of Solar City which was December 31 2016, there was detail of SolarCity’s inventory, and it was minimal - $172M. Meanwhile, Tesla’s inventory at the end of 2016 was already 2.07B. So, it is safe to say the majority of inventory at the end of Q1 2018 was from Tesla’s cars. I’ll be generous and let just say SolarCity’s inventory doubled since 2016, it still only stands at $340M which leaves $2.23B of inventory to Tesla.\n\nWhy is it significant? Well, one thing I didn’t tell you was that out of $3.41B sales in Q1 2018, automotive revenue was only $2.7B. The rest was energy sale. So the true inventory/sale ratio for Tesla is $2.23B/$2.7B = 0.82! And why is it significant? Any sane person will know that much of inventory is just dead weight. You have to pay for storages, maintenance, etc. So unless you have a terrible production line (which might be true to Tesla) that you can’t scale fast enough or you can’t get rid of your inventory fast enough, you are an idiot to keep that many inventory just to be safe. It is like they are keeping almost a quarter worth of sale in their inventory.\n\nIn the grant scheme of things and everything else is going on at Tesla, inventory might be the last thing that investors pay attention to, but in my opinion, something is not right. Are they doing this on purpose to keep their assets inflated for financing purposes? Or are they just straight out lying about the attractiveness of their car to lure more customers? Or am I missing something? Help me out here guys.\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/financials/balance-sheet\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/gm/financials \n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/f/financials\n\n**Edit**: Aha, upon reading up the 10-Q, I found this clause:\n\nCredit Agreement\n\nIn June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks.
