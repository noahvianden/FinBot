To help us help you, it is always best to post when you bought and for how much.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n- As another post says, AAPL is an expensive stock and so 10 shares, even if they go up $20 a share will only net you a $200 profit.  Think about selling the 10 shares for a little profit and buying more shares (100?) in a lower priced stock that has some room to run.\n\n- Fundamental Analysis should be reviewed for AAPL.  Look up how to do this if you are new, but you might find through this analysis that AAPL has some concerns about products and their future.  Still an awesome company, however they may have some headwinds that might mean your 10 shares could languish.\n\n- Regardless of if you decide to keep AAPL or buy stock in another lower priced company, look at selling Covered Calls against the stock with the strike price above what you paid for the shares.  This can be a win-win with you collecting money on the option to help super charge your returns on the stock.  If the stock runs up and is called from you, it will make money from both the option and the increased stock price.  The biggest downside risk is the stock price dropping, however you have that now just holding it without getting this extra return.\n\nBest of luck!
