Any thoughts?", "id": "8jm0d3", "created_utc": 1526394645.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "Well look at the board of directors, and the CEO older men who are paid crazy sums of money, but realistically have very little to do with the company itself, meaning they don’t put in work like let’s say someone like Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates puts in to see their company continue growing and expanding in to the future. \n\nDifferent industries I know, but a product is a product no matter what it is, PM is a Tobacco company and for a CEO of a Tobacco company to come out and say “a future without smoking can be a reality” is so beyond counterproductive to what the company actually is blows my mind, it really does, yes it’s a noble idea, but sir if you want a noble profession being the CEO of one of America’s number one killers is probably not the job for you nor is it very beneficial to investors who see cigarettes and smoking products for what they really are, a leisure product, like that of alcohol, which surprise everyone, it’s really just as bad for you if not worse. You don’t see the CEO of Anheuser-Busch saying “oh hey world a future without alcohol can be a reality” because number one we’ve been there tried that and it didn’t work, and number two it’s just not realistic, a person can be alcohol free, but trying to impose that on billions of people at once isn’t realistic, and the same goes for cigarettes. \n\nComing out with the IQOS as a smokeless tobacco product is a nice thought, but if someone who has been smoking cigarettes for 10 years and has no interest in quitting do you really think they’re going to be going out and buying an IQOS? Probably not because despite the reality of how bad smoking is for people, some don’t care and are content with their leisure activity, which they have the right to do, and PM should be seeking ways to keep that in place for their loyal customers and find ways to work with the FDA to make that happen in the most ethical way possible. PM needs to embrace itself for what it really is, and not the exact opposite, having the IQOS as another product is smart, but to come out and say it’s the future altogether is just dumb. The saying “don’t be something you’re not” very much applies to PM right now. \n\n The IQOS looks just like the vape pens I used to buy in DC when I used to smoke pot, smokeless marijuana. And that’s where I’ll get to my final reason, marijuana. Why in the world  has PM not been pleading with the government to legalize marijuana? Personally I think it’s just as unhealthy for people as cigarettes and alcohol, and is a literal cash cow like the other two, so why aren’t we seeing any momentum with this here? \n\nYou would think that by 2018 where casually smoking a preroll or pot vaping in downtown DC is as common as it was back in the 40’s where people were casually smoking cigarettes over a cup of coffee in their offices chatting away. You’d think one of the worlds largest Tobacco companies that has had a consistent 5 year low would be banging on the governments door doing whatever they could to move the process along so they could start mass producing a product that consumers really want, marijuana and the smokeless marijuana alternatives vape pens sold as singles in tubes, idk realistically all that IQOS and the vape pens and all that stuff is pretty bad for the environment, so that would probably be the next battle/lawsuit, but regardless of that, where is the innovation PM? Ambition is not the same as innovation and I think that’s what it really comes down to, as ambitious as PM makes itself out to be the company takes little to no steps towards the right kind of innovation it needs to keep itself going, it needs a mix of younger people to help the board to see what the right kind of innovation is before it’s already happened, it needs to quit suing countries over regulation laws and discontinue selling their products in those countries and put those resources used for legal fees and the job cuts that would come with the discontinuation of those products sold in those countries and put that money toward 1. Merging back with Altria 2. Fighting for the legalization of marijuana, the right to produce it and the right to acquire pot businesses already established within the US. \n\nPeople aren’t buying PM because it has not been showing itself to be innovative company and that’s what younger investors want. They want innovation and they want to see change, and until PM puts its big boy pants on and gets to work, it’s going to keep getting worse.
