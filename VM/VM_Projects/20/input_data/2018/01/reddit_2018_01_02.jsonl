You have a stock at $172 and you want to enter a trade with a breakeven of $182 and target is for the stock to go to $182-$183. Basically that means you need the stock to move $10-$11 in the right direction to target a 0%-50% gain?  It's not difficult to see why that would be a bad bad way to bet. Don't do that.\n\nAlways consider your target price and then compare the reward against the breakeven and how far OTM it is.\n\nFor example, you can buy the $175 call for 3.75. Your breakeven would be $178.75 (much lower) and if your target of $182 is hit, you have a ~100% gain.  Same stock, same price targets, but much lower breakeven and still targeting the same rewards (actually better).\n\nThis is only one small piece of how to look at it though. Doesn't fully consider POP, and also you do not want to enter a high IV trade like an ER trade without making it spread to further lower the breakeven cost.\n\nIf you did a spread, buy the $175 for $3.75 and sell the $180 for $2.
