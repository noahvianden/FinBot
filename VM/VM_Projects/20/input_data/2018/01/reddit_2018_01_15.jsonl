{"title": "Portfolio Insurance and Speculation on a Crash", "selftext": "For insuring my portfolio against a black swan event, I've heard a good rule is to put 2% of your at-risk capital toward buying unit puts on SPY or SPX.

At a 15% drop, then my insurance should be actually making me money.\n\n(PS I'm getting this all from the book *The Option Trader's Hedge Fund*)\n\nIf that's true (let me know if I'm off base here), what is a good expiration length for the insurance?

This means it is highly likely that all these plays will be losers for the next several years, unless a person lucks into loading puts right before a steep decline.
