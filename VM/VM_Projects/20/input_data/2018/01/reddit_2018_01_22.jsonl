{"title": "$AMD - Still Not A Long Term Hold...Yet", "selftext": "I know AMD is a meme favorite and I am fully prepared for the incoming downvotes. AMD is benefitting from INTC mishaps and is carrying a lot of momentum heading into earnings. Buyer beware though, after the huge run up in 2016, AMD has been trading sideways between $9.50 and $15.50. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\nI see it falling back below $11.78 after earnings which would produce another lower swing high and test back to the bottom of the trending channel in the $9.50 area. Until this breaks above $16 or below $9.50, play the trading range. \n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe good news for AMD holders is while the price isn't breaking out, volume, which often precedes price, is breaking out. Could be a bullish sign and a triple bottom formation could be in play, but again, I think this has more to do with the INTC news and speculation that AMD will capitalize on it by gaining marketshare. I just don't see that happening but I'm more than happy to be wrong about that.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n[AMD Weekly Chart](https://i.imgur.com/7gCVoQY.png)\n\n", "id": "7s5qzw", "created_utc": 1516627865.0, "score": 65, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "Downvotes don’t affect financials, right?\nThanks for your contribution ", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "AMD has been consistently predictable, a run-up to earnings and then an immediate fall after.

Gamers are very unhappy because they can't even buy GPUs because the mining community are buying them in bulk. It got so bad that Nvidia are asking companies to not sell in bulk in order to not alienate their core customers for that they had for decades. I have seen sites being posted here that showcase all of the latest and greatest GPUs being out of stock. Hence why there is such a powerful rally around Nvidia stock. This also means people who can't buy Nvidia cards are resorting to buying AMD cards instead. \n\nThen AMD's EYPC server chips are already great and reportedly doing well. And all of this contravesy around chips being a security breaches are... believe it or not a good thing in terms of sales. Consumers don't really have options other than Intel and AMD. Paranoid and dissatisfied customers will either buy a new computer with these chips or upgrade their chips to newer Intel/AMD chips.\n\nAnd the run up won't be huge since investors don't enjoy the false promises AMD analysts led them to believe (price was stagnant all year long, moving up only to fall back down) so the expectations coming in won't be high either.\n\nThat being said, I won't be jumping in until we get to see how true everything I'm thinking about AMD is going to be.

They stated that they wouldn't see much revenue for Epyc until 2018.  No one is going to deploy and build a giant system on a brand new untested architecture right after release.

It's a spinoff consumer credit arm from GE. Their business is really quite simple - they offer white label credit cards (store brandable cards) to big retailers like Walmart, amazon, etc. They also offer other financial services but credit is the bread and butter. It pays a nice and growing dividend, has an almost monopoly in big US retail stores. They also just reached a big deal with $PYPL to acquire  $6.8 billion in receivables, including PayPal’s U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio, which totaled approximately $5.8 billion in receivables. In short, they are expanding very rapidly and getting in on new technologies to further compound growth. The new tax cuts are going to be a big deal for people who use Synchrony's services, as well as piggybacking retailers they partner with doing better because of a lower corp tax rate.
