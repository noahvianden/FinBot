{"title": "The importance of the Wayfair Supreme Court decision.", "selftext": "For those of you who are not familiar with the case, this is one of the biggest developments in the Sales/Use tax world in a long time. The Supreme Court's decision will have a huge impact on any company that sells products online. The largest impact will be to smaller online retailers. So forget amazon and eBay as they will still be impacted but are large enough to be able to adapt and handle the change. \n\nThe Wayfair case overturns the longstanding precedent of Quill. In Quill it was found that states could not impose tax on retailers unless they had a physical presence in the state. This allowed for online sellers to not have to pay tax if they where shipping to a state where they had no employees or buildings. \n\nNow with the recent Wayfair ruling, states have the ability to tax retailers even if there is no physical presence. If online retailers sell enough goods into a state they will be forced into paying sales tax. \n\nOne of the biggest challenges these online retailers face now is not paying the tax but managing the compliance burden. Companies will need to determine not only which states they have to collect and remit tax in but also local jurisdictions. This compliance burden will be huge and could negatively impact a companies bottom line. \n\nThe Wayfair decision now shifts the competitive advantage online retailers once had back to brick and mortar stores. While I still believe online retail will continue to outgrow brick and mortar the playing field has become a little bit more leveled. \n\nMy play\n\nI am looking to smaller companies who do most of their business online, these could be good potential short plays. I have yet to come up with a strategy to play this case, because it is hard to predict what the actual finical impacts of it will be.", "id": "8v3p9s", "created_utc": 1530381942.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Yep, they did.
