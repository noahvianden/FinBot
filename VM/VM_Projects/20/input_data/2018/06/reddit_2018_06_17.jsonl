Eventually the stupidity has caused enough bad investments that the good times are no longer good.\n\n**2.** In basically the whole world, most money is created by creating an equal amount of debt, plus interest.  This means at any given time there is more debt then money in existence, and so it guarentees no mater how smart, heard, etc... people and institutions work, someone or something is going to have more debt then they can repay, and the only way to clear it out is bankruptcy.  So from time to time there literally must be some bankruptcies to clear out the debt that is always greater then the money available to conceivably pay it.  Often zombie companies build up and bankruptcies start happening as a chain reaction leading to bad times.\n\n**3.** long term: economic gains are by % on previous: GDP, earnings, etc...  so this is exponential.  For no down-times ever, you are thus hoping for exponential growth going off to infinity on a finite planet with finite resources (at least until we start building space colonies).  If you do the math on that, then having nothing but economic good times for something like 200 years would mean that the surface of the earth would have to be hotter then the surface of the sun from all the industrial activity taking place on it – not talking about global warming, I mean literally there would need to be that much heat-producing activity baking the surface of the planet away 24/7.
