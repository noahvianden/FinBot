{"title": "My play on TGT", "selftext": "Just wanted to share a play I made with my rationale for entering it.\n\nI was following TGT during their earnings.  Right before the earnings, it was approaching an area of resistance - with the RSI reaching the top, with no real signs of prior weakness.  It gapped down about $4 dollars after their earnings report, missing by $0.07 - but they still posted strong numbers.  \n\nI waited until 5/25 (3rd day post-earnings) to enter a long position with the assumption that TGT was going back up.  The technical indicators were pretty good, and the IV was low - so I felt it was an appropriate time to go long.\n\nMy position was a synthetic long static delta backspread:\n\n- TGT was trading around $71.\n\n- Bought 2 JUL 18 65 Calls ($7.17 x 2 - roughly $1.17 of extrinsic)\n\n- Sold 1 JUL 18 70 Call ($3.35; $2.35 of extrinsic)\n\nThe premium collected from the short call paid for all of the premium of the long call (+$2.35 for the short and -$1.17 x 2 for the longs).  Long with a neutral theta - the only way I like it!\n\nToday, TGT is up $5 from when I entered the position - so I closed it for a $500 win.  My target profit was around $1k ($81), but I was happy enough with today's $3 move.  Had TGT moved lower after the 4th-5th day (after earnings), I would have got out immediately - as this would have been an indicator that my initial assumption was wrong.\n\nThis trade tied up $1100 in capital, vs. the $7100 of capital it would have used to long 100 shares @$71.  \n\nThis is an example of how to use options as an alternative method for holding stock - and a much cheaper (less capital) way of doing it.\n\nThe most I could have lost was $1100, and that would have only been the case if TGT fell under $60 while I was holding.  There would have been the same amount of loss had I bought 100 shares at $71, with a drop to $60.  \n\nHere's a [chart] (https://imgur.com/a/7pjODlx).", "id": "8ojfj4", "created_utc": 1528135481.0, "score": 100, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 23, "comments": [{"body": "Excellent trade, thanks for sharing the details and rationale so clearly!\n\nNicely done!", "score": 19, "replies": []}, {"body": "Well done! I did a whole bunch of research into TGT myself but wasn’t sure what to do, then my algo I’m testing indicated a buy so I went for it.  You made a more reasoned move with the right timing, I think TGT is still good for a LEAP if someone wanted to just trade that way.  \n\nThe weekend pop gave me a quick 150% on my $500 investment, good start to the algo, its one fault is it can be too slow and miss the pop, otherwise it’s currently got me at +48% on some KO calls, +80% on MRK (Those two should be closed soon, I had 50% set on KO and marked MRK for 150% but it’s a 6/29 expiration so I’m not letting it run beyond the week), then +15% on an HPQ play and -15% on an OXY, but I think that means it’s just a better buy if it doesn’t pop tomorrow the way this has been performing.. It’s indicating a pretty definitive short on LMT but its’ options market has poor liquidity so I held off.\n\nOf course now I wish I put more confidence in my algo but at most I’ll give it 1-2% per play and try to make them all less than a week, take the money and run..\n\nI’m blabbering just because you said TGT and it was my % winner of the day.

I've never considered a backspread, but I like the neutral theta component. Does it often work out to be theta neutral like that?\n\nI also learned that backspreads are when you have more long calls and ratio spreads are when you have more short calls - I had just thought ratio spreads described uneven spreads in either direction.\n\nAnother way I realized to envision this trade is just a vertical spread with a naked call. The naked call is what provides the infinite gain potential and the vertical spread provides the theta balancing. \n\nYou could also have theoretically just closed the call for the gain and kept the vertical speed on to see if you would capture the entire gain, cutting your remaining at risk capital to 3.82, though at 2:1 risk reward, probably not worth it, esp after the run up.

From my own limited testing, it generally depends on IV and how deep you want your long calls to be ITM to see if you can go theta neutral / cancel out extrinsic values.

With this backspread, the extra call layered on top should give me that edge even on plays where I'm half right.\n\nNow the only thing to think about is size positioning.  Some of the plays I'm in are just on the border of my size position with just a call debit spread.  Putting on a backspread will bump me way over with that extra call unfortunately... guess I'll have to stick with call debit spreads for those.  \n\nAlthough another slightly riskier option I came across today - a ratio spread.  But I think that's only viable really for really long expirations, like LEAPs.  The premium from the short way OTM options would be so negligible with short dated options, the risk would hardly be worth it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, this can still be capital intensive from what I've seen with other underlyings -- especially the more you aim for minimizing theta.  \n\nThinking I might do some of these to keep things simple and simulate stock plays to gain exposure to companies I'm interested in without using too much capital or letting theta eat away at me to do so.
