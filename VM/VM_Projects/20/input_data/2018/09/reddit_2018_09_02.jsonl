{"title": "AMZN $2050 iron butterfly - bad idea?", "selftext": "Someone please explain to my why this is a bad idea, it seems too good to be true. I want to sell a 9/21 or 9/28 iron butterfly for AMZN consisting of a 2040 long put, 2050 short put and short call, and 2060 long call. My plan is to close it early if/when it reaches 2050, which if I'm not mistaken is the price at which Amazon will reach 1 trillion market cap. As per Robinhood I can sell this iron butterfly for more than $900 credit, which means the max I can lose is less than $100. I know I won't get to keep the full $900+ if I close early, and I'm ok to lose $100 or so if the price doesn't go to 2050 before expiration. What's the catch here? Is there a high chance I'll get assigned on the short put early, since it's in the money, and most likely I'll just lose the $100? Would I not get filled if I try to close when it's around 2050, due to volatility or something else? Would I have to place a limit order ahead of time so I can \"catch\" it when I'm profitable, in case it decides to shoot up past my range before I can close? Would the amount I'd make if I close early too small for it to be worth it? The other thing I was considering was a 2040-2050 put credit spread, or even a put credit spread that's below the current price, but if the stock happens to go down I'd lose a lot more than with the iron butterfly. If I go the iron butterfly route, should I widen it so there's a wider range where I'm profitable?
