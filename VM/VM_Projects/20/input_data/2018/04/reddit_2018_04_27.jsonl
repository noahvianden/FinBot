{"title": "Covered call questions", "selftext": "I’ve been considering a basic covered call strategy but want to see if I’m misunderstanding something.\n\nMy goal would be to choose stocks I am bullish or at least neutral on. Say Ford for example. Currently priced around 11.5 and I would sell slightly OTM calls that leave less than 5% upside and yield roughly .5% on a weekly basis assuming the underlying doesn’t move. I miss out on the upside but .5% a week can yield 20% a year, rounding down for commission. I know I’m exposed to all the downside, but wouldn’t the underlying need to drop more than 20% for me to lose in a given year. Or the other way, as long as the underlying doesn’t fall more than 20%, I will be profitable? It also pays over a 5% dividend yield so as long as it doesn’t fall more than 25%? I know these are approximations but is the general idea correct?\n\nConsider a more volatile underlying like AMD, calls can yield 1% or more on a weekly basis. Does this mean as long as AMD doesn’t fall more than 50% in a given year I will be profitable? \n\nI’d rather consider this with SPDR ETFs but my account size is too small for that at the moment.\n\nDoes it sound like a high probability chance of securing 10-20% a year? It does to me but I know nothing is that easy. I know it’s not as exciting as some of the other stuff posted here but sounds like it decent strategy if it is sustainable long term. Please attack and critique the strategy as hard as you wish. Are there ways hedge this, possible turn it into a collar, that would still let you keep majority of the premium and reduce a lot of the downside?\n\nThank you!\n\nEdit: Added to post.\n\n", "id": "8f7xcx", "created_utc": 1524792442.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "You could lose a lot more if the stock is volatile.\n\nExample:\nYou buy a stock at 100 and sell a ATM call for 1.\nPrice drops 25% to 75, leaving you down 24%.\n\nYou again sell a ATM call for 1.\nPrice bounces back to 100, but you're left with only 77.\n\nNow you could avoid this if you sell the second call at a strike of 100, but then you might not get very much premium for it.
