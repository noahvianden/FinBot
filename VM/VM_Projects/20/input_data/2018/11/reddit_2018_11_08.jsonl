If you look at the link posted, it will show the yield curve. The curve is the shape of the rates from short to long. When it is relatively steep, then the difference between short treasuries and long bonds is relatively large. When it is relatively flat, then the difference is relatively low. When it is inverted this means that short rates are higher than long rates. This happens when the government is pushing up short term rates, and the long rates are not rising along with it. This can happen when suppliers of capital are starved for yield so they are willing to invest heavily in the long term, or there is not enough demand to borrow in the long.  Well it can be for many reasons. The point is, when the curve inverts, then the short rates are higher than long rates. That is when the chart falls below the red line. If you can see, it is right around where the recessions are, those the vertical grey lines. When the curve inverts, then lending tends to dry up, liquidity freezes and some kind of catalyst will spark a recession. Things run in debt cycles. Once things have become terrible in the markets, the government drops short term rates, the curve will steepen, and then growth will continue. To relate to the OP, we are in a very long bull run because the government printed records amount of capital, and they also took a very long time to start raising rates. The delay in the raising of rates is fuel for this fire. Other factors were at play as well, of course as various people have mentioned.
