SHOP will be the leader of the commerce area when this takes affect. Avg 140, long SHOP.\n\n3. PAVM – playing FDA catalyst, avg 1.27, only playing catalysts end of year, and this fall. More risky, but if you do the DD, you will see what I see. \n\n4. MSFT – What more is there to say? Avg 109, looking for next leg up.\n\n5. MU – Looking for reclamation of that 50SMA, in small, 52 avg.\n\n6. GTT – Off of insider purchase, in SUPER small (2 shares), will add later, just need more DD here. I like to add a good ticker for 1 or 2 shares so I know to research it more. Avg is 42\n\n7. TLRY – banking on the weed boom, avg 50\n\n8. CRON – same as above, in at 11. \n\n**Disclaimer= Everything I write on here is my personal opinion, and shouldn’t be taken as 100% true. Make sure to do your own DD and not to blindly follow others, no matter how “good” of traders they are. All traders are wrong, so don’t be surprised if something on my watch list doesn’t happen exactly how I wrote it down. The important thing is to make a plan, stick to it, and if something changes, adjust it accordingly. Making a plan helps curb your emotions when investing, and keeps you objective.
