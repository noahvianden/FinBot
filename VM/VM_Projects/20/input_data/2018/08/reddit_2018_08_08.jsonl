{"title": "Knowledge Share", "selftext": "Hey all,\n\nI'm creating this thread for tips / learning methods that you have personally used to gain a better understanding of the market. Anyway, to start the goodwill I will share how I've gained my knowledge to date.\n\nFirstly, I cannot recommend more the book \"Principles\" by Ray Dalio. The first 200 pages or so are very insightful on what it takes to be successful in the market, and just how much you must take into account. If you don't wish to read the book you will not benefit to the extent I have, but here are some of my key takeaways: \n\n**Principles**\n\n1. Always consider cause and effect relationships. The relationship of history, politics, and economics are very tightly related. \n2. History repeats itself. Dalio amassed his 160Bil management fund (Known as Bridgewater) through 30 years of trial and error. He developed a system to judge the risk factor of the market given previous exposures of the stock exchange. A proper understanding requires the analysis of all previous crashes, what/why/who/how it happened. \n3. Know the difference between Speculating and Investing. Most people are speculators and that is BAD. Don't throw money at something because you think its price will rise (Buffet also shares this thinking). Investing is throwing money at something because of its intrinsic value, its benefit to society, and its moat. \n4. Here's a fun example of the detail (although I'm just summarizing) that Dalio went through to understand the Soybean market. He began by studying average crop yields, yearly rainfall, average acreage of a farm, and identifying all the major states that farms are in. He then read about the usage of soybeans and their importance in the animal feed industry. So thus, the population of the cows and pigs (some main animals) are highly indicative of the demand for soybeans. He further read into birthing periods of these animals, mortality rates, and what years were most fertile. He also considered corn yields and how much they were farmed because they are often a substitute depending on price of soybeans. Dalio then analyzed these cause and effect relationships for select periods of time throughout US history. By the time he reached his conclusion on the movement of soybeans in the foreseeable future, he was wrong. Everything pointed to yes, and as a young investor he was arrogant and believed he couldn't be wrong. This just goes to show, never assume you're correct. Let logic and history guide you towards solutions. What can be taken away is that, if you DO speculate, you better damn well do some research. Research is not a quick google search, it's not listening to other Redditors (although I have anyway), but grinding a few hours or so to consider as many cause effect relationships, and then logically come to a conclusion. \n5. Don't give up. Dalio bankrupted hundreds of millions in his beginning, today Bridgewater (he retired last year) 160 Billion + dollars. \n6. Converse with other intelligent people, respectfully disagree with them and work logically and calmly to come to a more inclusive conclusion. You can't both be right, don't let ego get in the way. \n\n7. Act like an average investor, receive average results. Don't be a trend follower, don't invest because others do. \n\n8. Cash rules. \n\n\\- If a company doesn't generate cash it won't stay alive (notice Tesla's Elon Musk is a genius of boosting his stock without actually profiting through his brash and bold statements, he has kept this up for a year now since he missed his production numbers by 200,000. He's been manipulating his stock trying to squeeze shorters for almost a full year. If you check the rolling averages you will see the year average is flat, kept afloat by his statements.) \n\n9. Invest in things you understand. If you don't understand biomedical or biotech, you probably shouldn't invest in it. You won't know what is truly beneficial or what its specialty is. You can only rely on interpretations of others (who probably tell you things so that you act how they want you to)\n\n**Thing's I've noticed (and probably many others) about the market currently.** \n\n1. Anyone worth anything knows about the PE Ratio and how it relates the stock price to the intrinsic value of a company. Please visit: [http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/](http://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe/) for the history of market PE ratio since its inception. You will see the INSANE bubble the market is currently in. \n2. The Fed has not raised interest rates even though we are experiencing major inflation. This has been going on since 2009, and now the problem is most likely unfix-able (once again, you are never sure). If fed raises the interest rates in the near future to combat inflation, expect a negative reaction from the market, as this often shrinks the economy (which is a good thing, but bad for stock prices and public opinion). \n3. Warren Buffet currently has $110,000,000,000 sitting around in cash. I.E. he is not investing it because he knows the current state of the market is entirely overpriced. Don't pick up pennies in front of a steamroller. \n4. This China vs USA trade war is over-hyped for now. 32 billion in tariffs is really nothing in comparison to multi trillion dollar nations. It's media hype which is negatively affecting many of the stock sectors. However, thats not to say the farmers haven't been effected, as we are releasing care packages (giving them money) to sustain higher pricing. It is worth considering that China also has been in economic turmoil, and can't afford to push out any other business. They also don't import enough from the USA in order to match our tariffs to 300 billion. (feel free to argue which side you believe is in a better position. back it up with facts, quite frankly I think the discussion would require another thread)\n5. Don't get your news from major media sites. If you rely on Fox, Cnn, MSNBC, or any other of those brainwashing channels, you must be naive to trust their market analysis when the other 23 hours of the day they are showing Kardashians or complaining about Trump. Some sites I use: \n   1. Zero Hedge\n   2. Daily Observer (Bridgewater monthly economic condition report) If you read these articles you will understand just how deeply the big firms analyse market conditions.\n   3. Seeking Alpha\n   4. Bloomburg\n   5. Kunstler\n   6. Mishtalk\n   7. (I will happily accept recommendations from y'all)\n\n6. Learn how to properly read and analyse 10K filings and 10Q filings. This is a field I'm working on, I use [last10k.com](https://last10k.com) its pretty laggy, but its what I started with and I like it. I focus heavily on Consolidated Cash Flow Statements, and properly compare different quarters and years. I'm working (trying to find help) with creating a program which just grabs the info from companies of interest and throws it into an excel sheet so I can manipulate data and follow trends easier. \n\n7. Get comfortable with all the functions of your online brokerage (Charles Schwab, Etrade, Ameritrade, etc). Understand the fees involved with transactions and the risks you take on. \n\n8. Invest what you are willing to lose. \n\n9. Read. Read. Read. Read. Read. There is so much information out there, so many people have already made mistakes, you don't need to make the same ones. Learn from others, and better yourself. \n\nThat's all that comes to mind for now. I'm happy to hear anything y'all have to offer and happy to listen to any refutes you have. At the end of the day, it's all about the money baby.

However, it does have correlation to the amount of money you should be paying for a stock based on its intrinsic value. There is no reason to be purchasing a stock with PE of 32 (the current market average), as it clearly reflects the overpriced nature of the market (or individual stock).\n\n2. On what grounds would you say we're not in a bubble? We are dealing with a large inflation rate (3% per year) while the fed is only raising interest rate by .25 points in september? This overflow of cash, which is being dumped heavily into the stock market, and the average person is buying more and more of the same overpriced stock, creating a bubble. If you visit the link I shared of Shiller's PE, you will see that we have surpassed all previous market averages except for the dotcom bubble in 2001. I think that is enough to support the theory that we are in fact in a bubble. Am open to your response.\n\n3. I disagree with your statement that the fed has been raising interest rates since 09. Please see this link: [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/interest-rate](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/interest-rate) in which the fed has not raised rates until 2 years ago. The pace they are increasing the rate is not surpassing inflation. If we are annually at 3% inflation, and our rates has not surpassed 2%, I think this is cause for concern. This is also a sign of the aforementioned bubble. If you visit: [https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/](https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/) you will see that our inflation has grown 19% since 2009. We haven't been checking the inflation rate by means of interest rate hikes. Thus our outstanding inflation is roughly 15% since 2009 right now. That's pretty substantial\n\n4. I don't pay for any of those sites :) but I agree WSJ is great, and I will check out Barron's and Value line. I haven't heard of those.\n\n5. Glad we could agree about the media haha.

I will agree that is not the case for most stocks however I find it limiting to not buy one just because of one metric. Some of my best performers had high PE but when I did multiple Dcf with different assumptions they where very undervalued.\n\nI phrased the fed raising interest rates since 09 wrong so my apologies for that. What I meant was that they are starting to raise them. It is extremely detrimental for the economy if they don‚Äôt raise them very slowly. So higher inflation is a much better outcome for all than doing 1% hikes a year since that would tumble the markets down. It is a trade off we must make for now, and as the health of the economy recovers inflation will become the number one priority again.\n\nRegarding the Shiller PE, it doesn‚Äôt take into enough consideration of two things, Abnormal Market Cycle stages and relative interest rates. It looks to compare normal stages of market cycle to each, not the end recovery stages we are in. If you look at the relationship between PE,ERP, and Risk free rate those have been a more accurate indicator of ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù or over valued markets. In 2001 interest rates were high(over 5 percent) and PE was high. The internet companies had no earnings and were worth billions. So it was clearly a bubble to some point. Now PE is high because of interest rates being low, since everything in valuation builds off the risk free rate. And all the tech companies have very profitable business models.So are we over valued? Possibly but I believe we are fairly valued. However it is definitely not an insane bubble.

However, DCF eludes my comprehension a little more, as I read the equation on investopedia, it seems to be calculated by a calculated future cash flow (use Gordon Growth Model to help calculate it) divided by compounding interest rates... is this correct? \n\nInvestopedia:\n\n\"If the value arrived at through DCF analysis is higher than the *current cost* of the investment, the opportunity may be a good one.\" \n\nThe wording 'cost' is a bit vague for my comprehension. Do you calculate the DCF value over a period of years  and the end result should be higher than the present stock value? What I'm asking is, what exactly is this \"current cost\" mentioned.

It‚Äôs not included in the 10k and works best on mature companies that have had recent one time events that caused short term earnings to fall.\n\nDcf sounds way more complicated in writing than just looking at an example. Basically you discount free cash flows in the future at the weighted average cost of capital(compounding interest rate as referred to by investopedia). With cash flows in the future being more heavily discounted to reflect the increase risk. The standard is five years of cash flows and then a terminal growth rate.\n\nInvestopedia is referring to the current market price of a share when they talk about the cost. So for example if I do a dcf and find that ABC company is worth $10 but the current cost(market price) is $5 then it is likely a good investment. In general dcf is the most accurate way to value a stock. However different assumptions translate into different growth rates. Wrong growth rates will mess up your whole valuation. Wrong cost of capital will also mess up your whole valuation. That‚Äôs why having deep knowledge of the industry and business model and really knowing the ins and outs is vital. Because without it you won‚Äôt be able to forecast an accurate growth rate and cost of capital. It‚Äôs never 100% but there really isn‚Äôt a close second. All professional investors use this method to value stocks.\n\nI agree with the article in some points, I think we may almost be on the same page. It‚Äôs just I think that over valued and bubble are two different things. A bubble implies an extreme level of over value and I just don‚Äôt see that. Maybe not yet. I guess the only well find out is waiting a few years. I agree that things are at there highest levels but I can argue interest rates are the culprit.

I see dividend investing in the same light as a hard worker who doesn't expect immediate benefits, but over time with enough work, reaps large benefits. \n\nA question this raises is: how do companies determine the dividends that they pay out? As I've read, it is up to the discretion of the company board to determine the total amount. Is this something that wavers as their stock price wavers? Or is it more true towards the earnings, independent of stock pricing? My follow up question would be, how have dividends reacted over time in response to bullish or bearish NYSE? On more expensive stocks, I cannot afford to own enough shares to where dividends would be beneficial. Is it wiser to approach smaller companies and purchase high shares to access more dividend benefit, or approach larger firms purchasing fewer stock and thus not benefiting much from dividends? \n\nAlso, if you have any knowledge about best place to research historical dividend yield rates / returns, I would be happy to take a look. \n\nAlso, I figured OP was quite broad, I just wanted to get some main topics out there to spur discussion, so thanks for that. My investment approach currently is not that diversified since I'm not dealing with that much money ($10k), and figured in order to truly gain anything, diversification is not the correct route. To me, diversifying in this current market (at least in terms of diversifying stock choices by sector, which hardly is diversifying) is not worth it, as diversification works on a longer scale. It's also worth noting that the big name investors have only ever outperformed the S&P indices in the 5 or so years proceeding large economic crashes.

Mostly, earnings per share drives both stock price and dividend raises (in the long run). Some companies, e.g. $RGR, pay a fixed percentage of 'normalized' earnings (40% in this example). Others try to give out a raise every year, even if it means a slight balance sheet impairment ($T). Still others juice their earnings and play accounting games with their balance sheet to maintain/increase dividends but then have to cut it when things get bad ($GE). Dividends are nice because you \"Can't fake cash\" - the company must send out checks and ACH deposits from a pool of real money. For dividends, you need to pay attention to earnings quality and payout ratio. Mostly, follow earnings, earnings, earnings.\n\nDon't worry so much about stock PRICE as much as you do what each share REPRESENTS in terms of earnings power (income statement) and equity/debt (balance sheet). $GOOG is insanely expensive on a per-share basis, but on an EPS basis it's only $33ish per dollar of earnings. That's a little expensive, but not too bad. If you can only afford ONE share of $GOOG, that's fine. It represents a shit-ton of earnings.\n\nGo directly to the company's Investor Relations page and download SEC reports. 10-K's for annual, 10-Q's for quarterly. Pay attention to the number of outstanding shares, looking for dilution (more shares, less money available per share) or effective buybacks (less shares, more money available per share).\n\nIf you do approach investing from a dividend focus, which may or may not be optimal, you can set your early smaller purchases to DRIP (auto-reinvest dividends). Then when you have enough investments, you can unset that DRIP and let dividends pool so that you can make another purchase - let's say when you get to the point of $1000 in dividends per year, this makes more sense.\n\nDefinitely check out Joshua Kennon on About.com / The Balance. It's a veritable goldmine. https://www.thebalance.com/joshua-kennon-356025\n\nJust to note, we have no association with Mr. Kennon or Dividend Diplomats, just really like the information they're putting out for folks like ourselves.\n\nHope this helps :).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Fricking awesome reply!

Starbucks is going to go through a very uncomfortable year or two. Eventually, the Chinese market will take off, and they'll find some more growth.
