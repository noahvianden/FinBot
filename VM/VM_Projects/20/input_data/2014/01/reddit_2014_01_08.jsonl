But upon [further investigation](http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/plpe), I'm wondering what all the fuss is about. These guys are making revenues of $26,752 per employee, and now have a market cap of $20 million.\n\nProps to people who made out like bandits on stocks like this. But with so many players, there's bound to be some shaking out. You can either do tons of studying up on all of them to figure out who's going to survive, or you can just roll the dice and hope you get a 5 to 1 payout.\n\nAnd PLPE had a low of .34 and a high of .50 just today! I don't know, I might just break down and roll the dice.\n\nedit: [Here's a website with links to many companies in the sector](http://marijuanastocks.com/content/list-marijuana-stocks). I might go ahead and get some [MJNA](http://www.medicalmarijuanainc.com/), since they have several companies under their wings, good diversity in the field.\n\n[CBIS](http://cannabisscience.com/) looks like a strong cannabis science company. Legal marijuana won't necessarily be a great help to them per se, but the easing of restrictions and the increasing acceptance of cannabinoids for treatment will be.\n\n[PHOT](http://growlifeinc.com/) supplies growers, so they're poised to profit coming and going, with no risk to their assets from whatever Federal shenanigans might come. But they've already hit the target price of 0.22 they set back in June, when they were more like 0.05. I think I would wait before buying their stock.\n\nReally, all these stocks have a history of fast run ups followed by slow declines.

I'm honestly going to invest in it as fast as possible. There is such a boom in the marijuana industry right now in Colorado and Washington State that other states won't be able to ignore the amount of profit these states are making off the tax of marijuana. (Which I believe is higher then other items, correct me if I'm wrong though.) Soon, these other states will see the profits and make a very strong effort to legalize it in their state as well. It seems like everyday I open up Reddit recently, there's a new state either wanting marijuana or in the process of making medical marijuana available in their state. So, I think, it's the best investment you can do right now. Because, think about it, this branch of business has been in diapers for so long, and their finally growing up.
