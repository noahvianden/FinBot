{"title": "Stocks I'm watching tomorrow, 4/7/14!", "selftext": "Whatup y'all! \n\nNice week in the markets, though it was a bit choppy there were still runners every day. I had a pretty decent week but nothing special really. I am hoping that we pick up after this last pullback and push back through highs with a little force this time, instead of what happened this last time (nancy through then PLOP, lol). I think once we get above $190 on SPY we'll see a big run but until then it will remain choppy and not really suitable for swing trading or anything exciting. Most of the plays will be in super-momo stocks and stuff being driven by news so I have compiled a list of stuff to watch for the whole week, though I probably won't play any of them immediately. I just think these are worth watching as they look like they're setting up! So here we go:\n\n* ISR, BIOF, MNGA, UQM, VIMC all on watch for longs and shorts intraday. These are the \"super momo\" plays I was talking about. BIOF has a decent flag but needs a couple more days I thinkg. MNGA and ISR are also very volatile intraday so almost every day I've seen plays in them. VIMC looks sick for a bounce, and UQM over $3.05 could get moving. Again none of these are ready immediately, but all look interesting and are worth stalking. \n\n* DRNA long for a bounce...this thing has been down like 10-12 days in a row so it should be bouncing soon.\n\n* FRAN ECYT and DGI look good for dead cat bounce shorts. Both should be easy to borrow on most brokers. \n\n* PIR, DDD, GMCR SNTA and BCOV are all testing recent support levels and look ggreat for shorts this week if the market continues rolling over. They all have a similar look. Of the five I like DDD the best and believe that one might be ready tomorrow. \n\nHope this helps give ya some ideas guys and girls. Don't forget if you're curious about my newest course **[Psychological Warfare - Emotional Control in the Market](https://www.greenbartrading.com/education/courses/psychological-warfare-emotional-control-in-the-market)** shoot me a PM or let me know here and I'll hook ya up with a discount. It's gonna be a pretty awesome class and should help traders of all skill levels. Bunch of stuff I have learned over the course of many years of doing this that makes trading a lot more fun and less stressful! \n\nHope everyone has a great week! \n\nChris\n\n---\n\n**DISCLAIMER:** *I am a day/swing trader. LONG means I'm expecting price to go up, not that it's a long term trade. SHORT means I'm expecting price to go down, not that it's a short term trade. Just because I post these here does not necessarily mean I'm buying/shorting them. They are ONLY ideas, may not be traded at all, and if I do take them, 99% of the positions will be closed by the end of the day. One other thing...any swing recommendations should be taken w/ extreme caution - lock in some profits as I am not checking these to see if they have earnings or anything before posting, so if they do they could make crazy moves.
