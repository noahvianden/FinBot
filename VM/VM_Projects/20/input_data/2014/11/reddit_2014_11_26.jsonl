{"title": "TRADE IDEA: Doesn't get easier then this!", "selftext": "Before I start this post, I want to thank everyone for their input on the last one. Whether you agreed with my trades or not you still took the time to be apart of this sub reddit, and that's what it's all about, sharing ideas! Really tired of people who either blindly down vote or people who get into an argument and start to down vote. It's childish. I would like to think that since we are a community of traders handling large sums of personal equity we could at least have the audacity to stay civil and polite. I really want this community to grow, and I hope you do to.\n\n________________________________________________\n\nNow a recap of a couple of trades that I've shared with you guys ($= the amount of return made)\n\n* ZSL/DUST OTM Short Calls  = $$$\n* GME Short Calls on ER= $$$\n* AAPL OTM Short Calls(Theta Decay Play) = $$\n* YHOO Call Credit Verticals = $\n* IBM Put Debit Verticals=TBD\n\nI understand not all of us have the same risk tolerance. So I have decided to share a trade set up I've done all year with out fail. Three of my favorite stocks TSLA, GOOG, AMZN.\n\nThese three stocks are notorious for touching and sometimes closing outside of their 1SD moves. This is a great thing for us option traders because IV/RANK has been pretty cheap this year. \n\nIf you check out the charts I've linked you can see entry points for buying 1SD OTM Iron Condors. (vertical debit put/call spread). [ http://imgur.com/a/4b9It] The Study attached to the chart is just normal Standard Deviation with a 14 day period. Entries are any dip from an extreme deviation. \n\nI generally start at a 1SD move OTM and move up till I find a vertical that I like on both sides. So anywhere from 16%-25% Prob of being ITM. I Try not to use Weeklys but I don't mind. I want around 29-35 days on the spreads. I try to spend no more then $2.00 on the total IC, most times I can get each wing for .60-1.30.  Each spread must be 5 dollars wide. \n\nOnce my order is accepted I set limit orders in for both spreads **separately** . I do this because I only need to profit on one side to make a gain and don't want to waist commission closing out a worthless spread(plus it might come back and you might be able to gain something on it) \n\nFor profit you can generally sell your spread for around $2.00-$3.00 of profit. Since you should only be spending a total debit of $2.00 you have an extra $1 of profit!\n\nProbability of profit on this strategy will always be 30-50% depending on the strikes you use between 16%-25% Prob ITM. Those statistics go for any underlying. \n\nOne more picture of the strikes you should be looking at\n\nhttp://imgur.com/U13mLSw\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nI hope this post is clear and understandable. I've don't this all year on TSLA with great gains. Any questions please ask. It's late and I didn't proof read this sorry for grammar errors.  Happy Trading! \n__________________________________________________________\n\nEDIT 1:\n\nIn no way shape or form am I trying to brag about gains, I only put that up there for the people who were arbitrarily down voting me . I am not just posting trades to post for the hell of it. I've had plenty of loosing trades, but I don't make posts before I place them because they are less \"sound\" then my other trades.\n\nAlso, anyone that would like to read more about Standard Deviation I would definitely suggest to look into something called a \"Z-Score\". Really helpful indicator when looking for entry points for short/long/volatility bias revolving around standard deviation and mean reversion. What I posted above is just a a brief view on how you can profit without having directional bias. Entry is still important in the case you enter right before a dip then run up or during consolidation. \n\nAs MyFleetingDream has pointed out, there are never any silver bullet strategies. So personally I will bleed this strategy dry till it ceases to work. I do not use any other instruments in my trading other then Volume patterns and standard deviation. I just want to point that out before anyone else might think this is a post prompting up TA. I am not for or against other forms of TA, thought I'd make that clear.", "id": "2nfpy7", "created_utc": 1416967608.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 18, "comments": [{"body": "Can you ELI5 how you do this with the circled areas on the chart?
