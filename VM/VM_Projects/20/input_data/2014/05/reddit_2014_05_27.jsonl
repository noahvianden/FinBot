There's no hard and fast rule - but the biggest questions are 1) what are your monthly income needs? 2) how stable is your income? 3) Do you have any other liquidity needs within the next 5 years?\n\nTake your answer to number 2 - if it's \"really stable\", multiply number 1 by 3.  If it's \"average\", multiply by 6.  If it's \"not very stable\", multiply by 9.  That needs to be your emergency fund.  Invest it in cash, money market, and short term bonds, so that when you need it, it is absolutely there.\n\nIf there are any other liquidity needs within the next 5 years, I'd recommend zero-coupon bonds or something along those lines.  The goal is that only your long-term money should be invested in stocks.  Unless of course you're willing to delay your plans for 1-3 years while you wait for the market to come back.\n\nThe number one problem that you have in relation to the stock market is that you (perhaps as a professional hazard) regard it as a gamble.  Historically, the stock market has returned 6.8%.  That means that you should, on average, expect the return of your principal and 6.8% compounded yearly.  If you stay invested, historically, this has always been the case - the longer the holding period, the closer to 'the average' the results trend.\n\nYour stock picks are, in my professional opinion, atrocious.  Tesla is a wonderful company and a lousy stock - at some point people are going to realize that if Tesla was valued as a normal car company, to justify it's current share price, it would have to have about $14.5 billion in sales, which is only $13.9 billion more than it earned last year.  Also it has yet to earn a profit.  Invensense at least shows increasing revenue and profits, although a 69 P/E ratio means that, again, it would have to continue to grow profits at the same percentage it did in its best year ever, for the next five years, in order to justify its current share price.  Its balance sheet is relatively strong, but I did see some debt creep on there in Q4, and their Q4 numbers were VERY week.\n\nDIS is a stock that I own - I love the business, love the valuation, and plan on passing it to my children.  If you'd bought Disney in 1979, it would now be paying you a 100% yield - you'd get more in a dividend than you paid in 1979.  That's the kind of company I'm looking for - who cares about the 80x return over the past 30 years - management has consistently grown value and the business has grown fantastically.  Moreover, it's the kind of business that will still be doing what it does (in new mediums, and with IP that we can't even imagine now), in 100 years, much less in 20.  That's what I'm looking for in a company.\n\nThat's what you should be looking for - less gambling, more investing.  Plan on a holding period of forever, not 'the next six months' or 'the next major product rollout.'  Gamble with part of your money if you want...but focus on the fundamentals and the numbers will work with you.  My $.02.\n\nEdit: Q4 Quarter, apparently", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I'm a new trader as well.. I wouldn't go for Tesla for the charts.
