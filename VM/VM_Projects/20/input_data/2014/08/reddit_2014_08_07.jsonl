{"title": "Looking for some input on a externally managed portfolio", "selftext": "Hello everyone, early in july my father lost his battle with cancer. As you grieve, you realize you need to make plans for your future. He was a big shot banker but my parents were divorced, we were never close, and in the end i never learned much from him. Me and my mom don't/never had much money....and after his passing he left me quite a sum. I've been reading as much as i can, but as an evolutionary biology major i'm quite inexperienced in the field of finance/investments/economics, and all the questions i would have asked him i cannot have answered. Now for my question, i have been thinking quite hard about investing about 75-80% of the money with Wind Haven. They would invest and manage a diversified portfolio for me, i was wondering what everyone's thoughts were on that. I also plan on keeping a bit to invest personally in stocks, learn. I've been looking at Amazon, Disney, Facebook, and some small marijuana start ups....Just looking for input, criticisms, any help at all! Thanks so much for taking the time to read this.", "id": "2cws9f", "created_utc": 1407439042.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "Let me share an experience with a \"money manager\", my last one.  I have been investing for 30 years but every few years I reply to one of the many solicitations I get for a free management review.  This time it was with JP Morgan/Chase offered by my employer.\n\nAt our very first meeting I said to the guy, \"if you are just going to recommend I sell everything and buy your mutual funds, let's not waste each other's time.  We discussed my financial goals, he found out what other assets I had and at the time I had about $360k in an IRA, ROTH and a taxable account.\n\n3 meetings later he gave me a 60+ page report.  The first 3 pages was the disclaimer.  I will translate what it took JP Morgan 3 pages to say.  \"We don't have a clue what the market is going to do and this is just our best guess.\"  The report of course recommended I sell all my stocks and buy 5 mutual funds, \"for diversification\".  BTW they never even broached the capital gains taxes I would have had to pay had I liquidated my taxable account.  \n\nThe most interesting page in the whole report was buried back in pages 50 something.  It was a little, itty, bitty, tiny box.  It showed their \"guess\" as to what their mutual funds would gain over the next 2, 5, 10 years.  It averaged out to 5.2% with a BIG asterisk that said basically said we didn't deduct our fees in this calculation.  But what was WAY more interesting to me was that they included their \"guess\" what my current portfolio would appreciate in the same time periods.  Guess what?  Their own report showed that my current holding, they guessed would have beat them in the 2, 5 and the 10 year time periods.  On the 10 year time period I was beating them by 2 1/2%.\n\nSo of course I said, \"sign me up let me pay you a fee to make less money than I can if I do nothing\".  No I didn't.  But I liked the guy and we had what I would consider some frank conversation.  He told me honestly that because I had less than 1/2 million all I was going to get from them is boiler plate suggestions.  I give him kuddos for being honest.  Today am happy to say my portfolio is north of $600k and I would actually qualify for real recommendations from JP Morgan is I was willing to pay for them.  \n\nI do recommend you meet with these guys and anyone else because you learn things you didn't know before.  Just don't sign anything.  ", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I can 100% back you on not signing anything. And i appreciate the advice. I guess the problem lies within my lack of knowledge of funds vs stocks vs options vs IPOs vs etc......As i go into my senior year, it scares me to think i have 400k to invest, and maintain. I don't want to blow it, as it is about all i was left. I would like to purchase a car and invest the rest. So most likely about 350k. The thought of managing and maintaining a hopefully profitable portfolio while going into my hardest year makes me very anxious, which is why Windhaven seemed like a good start. I suppose you are right, and i may want to sit down and speak with one of these people in person. I was given a few brochures last i was there, 2 about basics in ETFs and Mutual funds which was miles above my head and one about Windhaven.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What is the $$ in now?

Probably better than some other places. There is no need to rush into anything. If a person wants to do their own simple portfolio do some searches on these terms:\n\nThree fund portfolio\n\nLazy Portfolio\n\nCoffee House investing\n\nThese are all variations of a simple, yet diversified portfolio. Windhaven will add a lot more complexity, like ten to twenty funds, and may also try to time the market for corrections and bear markets. However, the long term results won't be that different, however, the fees will add up over time. A person can do their own with just a little bit of research and reading. Again, there is no need to rush into anything. Even though cash or money markets pay nothing, better to let it sit for a little while, while educating yourself than to sign onto something that may not be that easy to get out of.\n\n/edit to add: think of it this way. If the portfolio is $500k, 0.8% in fees is about $4k per year, after tax money. How hard and long does your mom have to work to earn $4,000 in after tax money? Is it worth spending 40 hours, 80 hours or perhaps even 200 hours (if a person is a slower learner) reading and learning over the course of several weeks or months, to avoid that kind of annual fee? Each person can make an informed choice. \n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "First off, thank you so much for all of your help.
