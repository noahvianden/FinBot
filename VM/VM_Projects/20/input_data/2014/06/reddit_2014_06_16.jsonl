{"title": "Long term bets", "selftext": "Hey fellow gamblers, \n\nI see a lot of the 1wk-3 month plays, but does anyone partake in any long term gambles? Something where you plan to hold for 2+ years? \n\n I can think of FNMA and JCP, but what others are out there? At this point, NQ has become a long term gamble (though with the volatility, turning it over often seems to be the norm).  IBM might be a longer put (they keep claiming to hit $20 EPS by end of next year. If/When they don't share price should drop significantly). \n\nSo, is anyone parking their money in a company for a few years?", "id": "28a9t5", "created_utc": 1402931938.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 19, "comments": [{"body": "$SPY", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Zgnx", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "FNMA/FMCC - good buying opportunity.

Will be more excited if it goes back to $70 a share.  Hindsight is 20/20 but that one just felt like it shouldn't have been worth pennies.
