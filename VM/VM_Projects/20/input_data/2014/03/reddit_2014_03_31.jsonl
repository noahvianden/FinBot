The battery weighs over a thousand pounds and to compensate for all of the weight, the car has to be made of aluminum instead of steel.  So not only is the cost pressure coming from the battery, but the entire body as well.  Essentially, the model e has to sell in the 200k units/year range to be profitable.  They do not have the margins to fail to reach those volumes like other semi-luxury brands.\n\nBy the time the model e reaches market, ,Tesla would have also probably reached the 200k sales point where the federal rebate gets phased out or be very close to it.
