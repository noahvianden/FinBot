I I know the basics of how calls and puts work but I'm positive there's much, much more to learn.  Basically, I want to be able to take some risk based on things like (just as examples): if I think Facebook will drop 5% after earnings call, or Apple will drop 10% by Christmas, or Google won't move in the next 2 months.  How would I go about maximizing options potentials based on things like this?  Thanks in advance for any advice.
