{"title": "Will AMD make a comeback?", "selftext": "AMD is down another 10% today and is at 2.95 a share. The company has a trend of getting killed during earnings, but always seems to bounce back to $4+ a share at some point during the quarter. I'm betting against them for next week's earnings report, and I expect the company to fall to around $2.70 then. \nWould it be a bad idea to buy into the company? Looking at the one year graph of the company, it's very clear that AMD always comes back after earnings. What do others think?

The market's interpretation of this event is that the upcoming earnings are likely to be a surprise, and the obvious conclusion to be made is that it's not likely to be a good surprise.  My interpretation is that AMD should have probably warned about earnings some time ago, and Rory Read didn't *do* that, and hence, when that information made it to the board, they saw that as a serious lack of oversight.
