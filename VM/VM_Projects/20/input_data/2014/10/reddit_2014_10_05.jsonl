However, to use dividend as a sole method to search for potential buys is illogical at best.\n\nDividends are simply cash that they company produced. They have a few options. They can disperse the cash as dividend, OR they could do what many companies do and reinvest the cash into future projects, further boosting the stock price. If management wanted, they could just keep the cash on hand  and not pay it to shareholders. The shareholders would not receive dividend but the value of the company would rise approximately the same amount to make up for the newfound cash.\n\nMy point is that: companies distribute their money in many different ways (dividends, reinvestment, paying off debt, cash holdings, ect.). They are supposed to do this based on what is best for the company and shareholders at the time. \n\nSo in my opinion, it is just as ridiculous to seek out solely dividend paying investments, as it is to, say, seek out companies based on any other single given variable. [You're not about to go short facebook because the P/E is high]\n\nLook at the company all together, don't only buy for dividends, or you are believing the fallacy in grampa's investment advice.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "When you own a stock, you literally OWN a piece of a company. 1% of shares = 1% of the company, so on. A publicly traded stock has a balance sheet value and a market cap. Both of these are independent \"valuations\" of the company. One is done by accountants and the other by investors buying and selling the shares.\n\nSo if the company has 100M worth of equipment and you own 10% of the shares, you literally own 10M worth on equipment in a way.\n\nYou would also be entitled to 10% of the companies profits. Except instead of receiving them as a dividend, you would literally have it as equity in the company. \n\nSo instead of the money going right to you, it's as if it is reinvested back into the company. So if you got 10% of, say, 50M total profits, and the company spent it all on machines, you would now own 15M worth of equipment in a way, as apposed to 10M before. This is because the company bought 5M worth of machines for you instead of paying you a dividend. This grows the company and can increase profit margins. Think about how compounding interest works. When a company reinvests it can grow significantly faster than if it is paying out dividends, leading to a (hopefully) even greater profit in the future.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, you would have to sell to see a gain.\n\nThe only point I am making is that non-dividend investments CAN be more profitable than dividend ones.\n\nJust like a gold bar does not pay you money quarterly. However if the price of 1 oz of gold rose from ~$500 to $1000 in one years time. That is a 100% gain. In the meantime, if you were holding XOM, you received a ~3% dividend.  [This is just an example, I am not advocating the purchase or neglect of either of these assets]\n\nThe point: It doesn't have to make a dividend gain for you to make money. Commodities have value.
