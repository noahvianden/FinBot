{"title": "Is TLT Hitting its Bottom? My Play for the Upcoming Rebound.", "selftext": "Throughout 2023, TLT has been on everyone's radar, with hopes of a resurgence. The fund has consistently drawn interest, attracting a whopping $16.68 billion since the year's start, nearly doubling its assets. Yet, it's mostly been a downhill journey.\n\nWhile it's a stretch to claim today as the definitive low, it feels like we're in the ballpark. For those willing to take a bold stance, consider a weighted ratio put bet:\n\n* Purchase 10 Nov17 puts at $85 for $1.26 each.\n* Sell 40 Nov17 puts at $80 for $0.39 each.\n\nTo capitalize on a potential bounce back, integrate a modest ratio call:\n\n* Buy 5 Nov17 calls at $92 for $0.96 each.\n* Sell 15 Nov17 calls at $98 for $0.18 each.\n\nThis strategy results in a neat credit of $90, against the standard collateral of $30,000.\n\nIn essence, I'm sensing a short-term trough. While a recovery might be followed by another dip in TLT, I'd welcome a drop below $85 in November. But should this rebound evolve into a rally, I'll be all smiles.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/corxd3evsurb1.jpg?width=1152&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0e35336d1f58325b42d6d96022d741977b7789e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r6ya18s5turb1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=206b831b9c4675c1f231ce983d8cc8312c9dc026", "id": "16y8d1m", "created_utc": 1696280648.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 49, "comments": [{"body": "What we think and what we feel doesn't matter, this thing can rip higher or shat lower and seems to do so defying what everyone thinks and feels.

The price of the bond and rates are inversely related; that means when interest rates go down, the price of the bond goes up, and vise versa. Longer term bonds are more prices sensitive to interest rate movements. \n\nThe fed effective rate right now is 5.33%. For illustrative purposes, if you held a bond that paid 5.33%, and next month the fed announced rates are going down, the price of this bond would increase, given the inverse relationship. \n\nKeeping the inverse relationship in mind, if you look at all the bonds TLT owns (which I have), the coupon rates on each bond are between 1.25% and 5.34%. When you look at the weight of each bond in relation to the overall ETF, 7.38% of the ETF has bonds with coupons between 4%-5.34%. \n\n92.62% of the ETF has bonds under 4% coupon rate. \n\nFor example, bond CUSIP 912810SU3, this is the largest weighted bond in the TLT ETF at 9.2%. It was bought Feb 2021 and matures (\"expires\") Feb 2051. It's coupon rate is 1.88%. Right now it's worth $53.04, assuming the par value was $100. For this bond to get anywhere near it's par value, the fed interest rate has to drop significantly, whole percentage points to have impact. \n\nOne question I  ask myself is, longer term bond are more price sensitive to interest rate movement; when just over 92% of the TLT ETF has bonds that have coupon rates below 4%, how much does the fed rate have to drop to cause meaningful (however you want to define what that means) positive price increase?\n\nAnother question is, at what point in time is the fed going to start dropping rates, and how fast? No one knows, but it's probably safe to say certainly not within the next year. 2+ years from now they *may* start to drop, but again, for how long and how fast?\n\nSo 2+ years we can speculate the ETF will probably not significantly increase in price based off: \n\n1. of how bonds work;\n2. the specific bonds that TLT holds;\n3. the inflationary environment;\n4. and how adamant the fed has been about fighting inflation by increasing rates and holding them where they are. \n\nOn the flip side, how much more can it be anticipated to drop? Right now it appears the market is pricing in further increases, and I say this based off when TLT first started falling off a cliff in December 2021, comparing that date to when rates first increase in March 2022. \n\nMarch 2022 was the first rate increase. TLT closed at 148.19 in December 2021 and has been dropping ever since, with the first largest drop in March 2022. The last four months have shown increasingly large drops again, starting in July. The market is supposedly forward looking, so what is the market pricing in (assuming the market is efficient)?\n\nI welcome any critiques and pointing out of flaws in my analysis.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for your analysis. I read it with interest and have a few comments.\n\n**1. Long-Term Bond Price Sensitivity to Interest Rate Movement.**\n\nIf short-term rate hikes led to equivalent yields in long-term bonds, their prices would decline significantly. And so would TLT, for the reason you mentioned - a majority of the bonds in TLT's portfolio were issued at low rates with smaller coupons.\n\nHowever, long-term yields don't necessarily move in sync or even in the same direction as the Fed's rate. If the rate hike cycle ends in a year and they go back to zero in 2 years for another 3-4 years or longer, why should the yield on 20-year bonds rise to 6% and pressure bond prices?\n\n**2. The Opposite is Also True.**\n\nA decrease in the Fed rate doesn't necessarily translate to a mega-rally in long-term bonds. Though they will surely appreciate.So, in response to your question, \"how much does the fed rate have to drop to cause a meaningful positive price increase?\" - I don't know. I can only reasonably assume that there will be some positive price increase.\n\nThat's enough for me. Because I'm not betting on a sharp rise in TLT. Rather, I believe its decline should slow a bit. And that's what we're seeing.\n\n**3. About Timing.**\n\nYou rightly pointed out that TLT began its decline in December 2021, three months before the first rate hike. The reverse will likely be the same. A year ago, we already saw a rally in TLT from 93.21 (October 21st) to 109.47 (December 7th) based solely on rate hike termination expectations. These expectations were unmet, but the movement was telling.\n\nSimilarly, with actual rate cuts, TLT's rise will start 2-3 months in advance.As for when this will happen - next year or later - I can't say. But I sense it might be sooner than many anticipate, perhaps by spring 2024.\n\nThe trigger won't be inflation reduction, but a potential stock market crash. Maybe even a bond market crash. Markets will need salvaging, and inflation concerns will be set aside.\n\nOf course, this poses significant risks for long bonds and TLT. When shorting TLT through put options, one must be prepared for this scenario.
