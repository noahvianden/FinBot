{"title": "Apple earnings", "selftext": "Hey folks, just out of curiosity, as a keen learner I have a question for the group. Since apple is going to post its earnings and it’s very likely going to boost its price, as options traders would you buy a straddle rather than just a call at a strike of 165? This way worst case scenario is that you are covered by the straddle if the price goes the other way. What do you reckon?\nIt’s just a discussion, I am not trading on big stocks yet!", "id": "133mbxk", "created_utc": 1682852755.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "> and it’s very likely going to boost its price\n\nUnless you have insider info, binary events are always a 50/50 shot.\n\n>as options traders would you buy a straddle rather than just a call at a strike of 165?\n\nAs an options trader I wouldn't buy a straddle or a call.

It's nice when you win, but they're a great opportunity to sell into elevated volatility. Strangles are a good way to capitalize on the elevated premium prices.
