Assuming you hold a 60:40 stocks:bonds portfolio (or 75:25 or something), it should be possible to withdraw 4% (of the starting value, adjusting only for inflation) per year for 30 years with little risk of running out of funds. That's the common-wisdom self-financing retirement plan that I'm aware of. There's still a lot of details left out, like exactly when and how to sell/rebalance. Some withdrawal strategies alter the allocation with time or in response to the market.\n\nI was wondering about using options to boost such a strategy. In Prime Harvesting withdrawal strategy, for example, you automatically sell a portion of your equities if they hit a price target. You could, then, sell that option until that happens. Similarly, if you know you'll sell bonds to rebalance if equities drop, you could sell put options backed by a portion of your bonds.\n\nYou might be able to get your 4% with theta strategies alone, until a downturn occurs (then the withdrawal is much more than 4%). I wouldn't expect theta alone to safely withdraw at any circumstance. But if boosting the returns with such strategies increases the minimum safe withdrawal rate, it allows one to finance retirement earlier.\n\nThoughts?", "id": "12pn77z", "created_utc": 1681747715.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "I'm absolutely going to finance my retirement with covered calls.\n\nPart of that is plowing any excess from the CCs back into account value.\n\nIs that better than the \"typical\" retirement strategy of slowly selling off your holdings for cash until you run out of such holdings?

If you want more retirement income, then wheel your way into a higher asset base and keep your \"SWR\" the same.
