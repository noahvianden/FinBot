{"title": "Trade Microsoft (MSFT) Earnings with Calendar Spread", "selftext": "Microsoft Corporation reported earnings for the Q2/FY2023 on Jan. 24th after market close.  Despite the overall under-expected EPS and Revenue, its strong cloud computing business and partnership with ChatGPT set an upbeat tone for investors to have confidence with its long-term growth.\n\n[Earning Outcome](https://preview.redd.it/xre31n595aea1.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=330652cef57eaf628461fc218ac144147f0f2119)\n\nGoing into the earnings, the price of MSFT has recovered from bleeding since Mid-Dec, and the IV has been expanding from 20 to 40. The IV percentile before earnings was in mid-30%.  This is not a terribly high IV environment compared to Oct. 2022. Given the IV expansion in recent weeks, I planned for an IV crush play.  \n\n[Price Actions](https://preview.redd.it/7lpu9ea58aea1.png?width=865&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=9c327809c748a4c65999b475e8a0ec9e1de80624)\n\n[IV Moves \\(blue\\)](https://preview.redd.it/l7ynf4698aea1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=505e4689a9988fb2e97ff79b527b25e7077d3e77)\n\nMicrosoft stock price as of 3:55pm on 01/24 is $242. The at-the-money straddle expired on Jan. 27 is priced at $12. This means that the market expectation of the post-earning price move is between $242 ± $12. This is known as the implied move. During the last 9 earnings, the actual moves by-and-large closed within the market expectations except for the one in October. The market environment however has been dramatically changed since then.\n\n[Post Earning Day Moves](https://preview.redd.it/fqdligvk9aea1.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0a5783929b4db318e53b0ee1042789494b927a3b)\n\n IV of the 01/27 expiration was 60%+ vs 30% of the 02/17 expiration.

This morning (Jan. 25), I set a limit sell order at $3.75 which was executed around 1pm when MSFT price recovered from the earlier loss.\n\n[Exit](https://preview.redd.it/1xdwbd79caea1.png?width=351&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3cc7ee2ed55b21ac778887f4e3c74a155a8e2c51)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy: [www.odds.trade](https://www.odds.trade)\n\nP.S.

{"title": "tastytrade capital allocation guidelines", "selftext": "# tastytrade book\n\ntastytrade recommends the book *The Unlucky Investor's Guide to Options Trading*.\n\nIt's written by two members of their research team.\n\n# Portfolio allocation\n\nChapter 10 contains a list of their key takeaways. Point 9 is on portfolio allocation.\n\nIt mentions the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Maintaining the capital allocation guidelines is crucial for limiting tail exposure and achieving a reasonable amount of long‐term growth:  \n>  \n>\\* The amount of portfolio buying power allotted to short premium positions, such as short strangles and short iron condors, should range from 25% to 50% depending on the current market volatility, with the remaining capital either kept in cash or a low‐risk passive investment. \\[refer to Takeaway 5\\].  \n>  \n>\\* Of the amount allocated to short premium, at least 75% should be reserved for undefined risk trades (with less than 7% of portfolio buying power allocated to a single position) and at most 25% reserved for defined risk strategies (with less than 5% of portfolio buying power allocated to a single position) \\[refer to Takeaway 6\\].  \n>  \n>\\* Generally speaking, at most 25% of the capital allocated to short premium should go toward supplemental positions, or higher-risk, higher-reward trades that are tools for market engagement. The remainder should go toward core positions or trades with high POPs and moderate P/L variation that offer consistent profits and reasonable outlier exposure.\n\n# Example for $100,000 portfolio\n\nIf we translate these rules to a $100,000 portfolio with a VIX at 19.25 (where VIX is at today), we get the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x6nrobg94fea1.png?width=1696&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcc4084e1049fa53c6bda0906e860390d63ff9ec\n\nHere's a link to that spreadsheet in case you'd like to try different values for portfolio size and VIX:\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IllDSrbAayflGFbU6LiQ7tTkZ4QB8UcgbCunCyU2OPo/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IllDSrbAayflGFbU6LiQ7tTkZ4QB8UcgbCunCyU2OPo/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n30% of the portfolio was allocated to short premium in the above example.

I.e. undefined risk strategies (what tasty recommends you allocate at least 25% of your portfolio to).\n* If you do not understand the math in the book, do not allocate according to the above.\n* If you're starting out, use defined risk.\n* If your portfolio is small use defined risk.\n* All of the research in the book is based on SPX strangles. Their conclusions do not necessarily apply to other underlyings (especially meme stocks).\n* When can you safely use short puts? When you absolutely do not mind owning the stock at the strike price you selected. Any other time? You had better know what you're doing.\n* I never saw a strong theoretical justification in the book for the above allocation.
