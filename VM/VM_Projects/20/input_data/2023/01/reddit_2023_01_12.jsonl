It is the company I've written about most extensively on this website. I'm amazed at what Warren and Charlie have built, and feel personally indebted to them for sharing so much knowledge through their writing.\n\nBerkshire warned investors long ago that forward returns would not be as impressive as in the past, since the company had grown so large. In recent years, I considered Berkshire the \"bond\" portion of my portfolio because I felt fixed income offered little return for substantial risk.\n\nThis has changed, as fixed income now offers a higher return than it did a few years ago. Coupled with a recent surge in Berkshire's share price and a decline in its largest holding, Apple (AAPL), I feel Berkshire is now fully valued, or perhaps overvalued, for the first time in years.\n\nCurrent Valuation - Book Value\n\nGiven the opportunity, would you have sold Berkshire at $360 last March before it crashed down to $260? I would have.\n\nWhat if I told you that Berkshire is just as expensive now near $320 as it was last year at $360?\n\nBerkshire's market cap on March 31, 2022 was $780 billion. Shareholder's equity was $508 billion, for a Price/Book Value of 1.54x.\n\nBerkshire's current market cap is $702 billion. Shareholder's equity as of Q3 was $455 million. The equity book since then is roughly flat, with weakness from Apple and Bank of America (BAC) offsetting strength from Chevron (CVX), Coca-Cola (KO) and American Express (AXP). Adding $5 billion in Q4-22 operating earnings (my estimate) leaves a Price/Book Value of 1.53x.\n\nThis is the top of the range shares have traded over the past 5 years. Nearly every time it has reached this level, it has reverted back to the ~1.3x level in short order.\n\nCurrent Valuation - Earnings Per Share\n\nBerkshire's operating businesses are having a good year as the economy further normalizes. Berkshire owns businesses with pricing power that are inflation resistant, so it is not a surprise that they have done well this year.\n\nBerkshire has had a record year and I believe we'll see another $5 billion in earnings in Q4, down from Q3 due to seasonality in their energy business currency gains in \"Other\" reverse due to the weaker dollar. BNSF rail traffic has also weakened in Q4, with total Intermodal & Carloads off 8.5%.\n\nAt the current $702 billion market cap, $29 billion in net earnings implies a 24x P/E before any consideration of \"look through\" earnings from the equity book.\n\nThe $325 billion in equities, at a P/E of ~16, adds another $20 billion in \"look through\" gross earnings. We need to subtract the $5 billion in dividends received (Q3-22 dividend income was $1.28 billion) from this, leaving $15 billion net.\n\nAdding $29 billion in Operating Income to $15 billion in \"net\" look through earnings, assuming we do not apply any discount to it (and I'd argue that we should) implies at 16x P/E.\n\nMore reasonable, for sure. But hardly cheap.\n\nOptionality of Cash and Share Repurchases\n\nDespite Berkshire's share price being under $280 for much of Q3, Berkshire only repurchased $1.05 billion worth of shares in the quarter, a huge drop off from last year.\n\nBerkshire had $109 billion in cash as of September 30th. The $11.6 billion Alleghany acquisition closed a few weeks later, likely leaving the cash balance today around $100 billion.\n\nThis is low relative to recent history and the size of Berkshire's float. I do not think Berkshire will go much lower than this level. Coupled with the higher share price, I think share repurchases and opportunistic acquisitions are off the table for the near future.\n\nShould we value Berkshire's holdings and associated look through earnings at 100%?\n\nWhen considering equity valuations and associated earnings, I believe it's appropriate to apply a moderate discount, perhaps in the 10-15% range, since Berkshire cannot sell most of its holdings without significantly impairing their price. Even with Apple, its largest and most liquid holding, what would happen if Berkshire announced it was selling? I believe Apple could drop 15% on the news.\n\nBuffett has often talked about \"Mr. Market\" swinging from overly optimistic to overly pessimistic. But Berkshire largely loses out on the ability to capitalize on Mr. Market's jubilant moods.\n\nWould Berkshire sell Coca-Cola, a company that's had flat operating income for a decade yet still trades at 25 times earnings, if they could exchange all 400 million shares for the current market price? I suspect they might.\n\nThere's no absolute \"correct\" answer here, and each investor will have different feelings about it based on their goals, timeframes, and feelings about Berkshire's specific holdings. But it reminds me of an old lesson from my father when I was bragging about the \"value\" of the individual cards in my baseball card collection. He asked \"which one of your friends would buy them\" at the prices I was quoting. I didn't have an answer.\n\nBerkshire largely can't sell its holdings at the prices they're quoted at, and I believe that merits a small discount when thinking about Berkshire's valuation.\n\nConclusion - what should investors do?\n\nWhile I believe Berkshire has gotten ahead of itself, it's far from a crazy valuation. For many investors, the best course of action may simply be to do nothing, especially if Berkshire is held in a taxable account with a low cost basis.\n\nIf I had offsetting tax losses, I may have sold Berkshire here, hoping to buy it back lower in the future. The way I look at it, even with some optimistic assumptions, Berkshire is trading at an earnings yield of ~6.5%, and I see many other opportunities to earn more than that safely.\n\nInstead, I chose to buy a January 2024 $310 protective put for $17, to add some general downside protection as part of an overall portfolio strategy, as I'm more heavily invested now than much of the last 18 months. If Berkshire continues higher from here, it likely means I'm having a very good year! If Berkshire drops back as part of a broader market sell off, having this hedge will allow me to be more aggressive in using my remaining cash.\n\nBest of luck to all Berkshire investors and thank you for reading!", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I can't believe the shortsightedness of the article.

My point is that they change how I *interpret* price/book value. They make it a worse proxy for price/intrinsic value.\n\nMaybe this way of thinking about it is helpful: when repurchases are made at prices below intrinsic value, some shareholders - the ones who sold their shares back to Berkshire - got a bad deal.  Other shareholders - the ones who held - got a good deal.  That is a transfer of value that is not taken into account when you just compare P/B at different times.\n\nIf you don't believe me, here is a quote from p.2 of the 2018 letter to shareholders:\n\n> it is likely that - over time - Berkshire will be a significant repurchaser of its shares, transactions that will take place at\nprices above book value but below our estimate of intrinsic value.

That's reasonable: **I don't think anyone believes the relationship between book value and intrinsic value is a constant (e.g., 1.3), for many reasons, not just buybacks**\n\nMeanwhile, the author is using book value as kind of a market price predictor, similar to the way I and others use book+float to estimate what the market will pay. He's saying: \"the market seems to use simple models to estimate what Berkshire's price should be, and it tends to converge on much lower values of this estimate than we're seeing today\"\n\n>This is the top of the range shares have traded over the past 5 years.

As a practical matter, if you care about real-world prices, you ignore Bloomstran's number\n\nBottom line, as a practical matter, if the market tends to sell Berkshire at 1.3x book (or similarly, tends to trade it at 1.0x book+float) you should be very careful buying it at, say, 1.5x book (or similarly, 1.2x book+float)\n\nAnd that's what the author is saying", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Ok, I see now what you're saying\n\n> The (intrinsic value per share)/(book value per share) is changed by (intrinsic value)/(price paid during buyback)*(size of buyback)/(size of Berkshire)\n\n> So your claim is that there's a very gradual drift in the connection between book value and intrinsic value. \n\nYeah, exactly.  The point is that we care about book value (or your book+float) only inasmuch as it correctly tracks intrinsic value.\n\nSo far the effect is pretty small.  For example, I just looked up that BRK has repurchased about 12% of its shares since start of 2019.  I think they would only do buybacks at a comfortable discount to their estimate of intrinsic value.  So let's be generous and say that they buy shares at a 1/3 discount to intrinsic value.  That means that book value as an estimator of intrinsic value has drifted by about 4%.\n\nThat means that if you see a P/B of 1.5 today, that would really be equivalent to a P/B of about 1.44 in 2019.\n\nI would probably argue the same about your book+float estimator.  I think if you were happy to buy at book+float in 2019, you should probably be happy to buy at 1.04*(book+float) today, or something close to it.  \n\nIt's not a huge effect, and you can argue that maybe my estimate of the discount is too generous.

Let me know the outcome...\n\nA short story from the past... In the pre-computer trading time, once I gave a phone order to my bank to sell my shares at 100, while the highest price on that day was 98 or so. The next day, the opening price was 105 and no trades were done below of that. Thereafter, the bank sent me the  confirmation that they sold my shares on that day for 100 bugs. Armed with the trading prices of that day (from the newspaper at that time), I insisted and got a correction of the first confirmation that my shares were sold for 105. Since than I lost my faith in the banks in general...\n\nLater, there was a time, when one could make big money with high-tech IPO-s (ie buy it for the IPO-price and sell it the next day with 20 to 50% profit). I tried to sign such IPO shares. After the first time being unsuccessful, I asked the consultant of the  bank, why I did not get any, although I signed for it, and although it was oversubscribed, I should have gotten at least a few.- I was told that the IPO shares were assigned to by drawing. Thus thereafter, on several occasions I tried to sign such IPO shares with increasing amounts of money, still with zero success. Than i asked again the consultant of the bank, why I never got any IPO shares assigned, and I was told that the reason was that these are assigned to higher volume orders. So on the next occasion, I signed with a ridiculously high volume and still got none. At this time, I gave up.\n\nLater I heard the story about a friend of my friend, who's mother was the owner of a very large and well known company. The mother told his son (who was a student at that time), that based on the recommendation of her bank, he should sign for the shares of an upcoming IPO. Both of them were at the same bank, both of them signed for the same amount of IPO shares: the mother got all shares she signed for, the son got none (the bank did not know who he was). Conclusion: upon an IPO, the consortia banks get a certain volume of shares to sell, which they shove on to their best customers as goodies, into their asset managements to improve their performance, and possibly also into their own pockets. I don't know if this is still like that, but this was the second time I lost my faith in the banks.\n\nThe third time I lost my faith was, when they placed a significant volume of their own real estate bonds into my wealth management portfolio, a few weeks before the US real estate crash.\n\nTake home message: DO NEVER EVER TRUST A BANK (or a trader)", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "$1M with market order is risky", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Would you mind explaining the risk?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You go to your brokerage app and enter an order to buy $1M worth of ticker symbol $XXX at market price.  \n\nYour broker sends that to an exchange.
