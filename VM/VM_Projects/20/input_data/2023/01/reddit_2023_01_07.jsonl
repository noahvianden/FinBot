Genuinely wondering.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[Market share](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketshare.asp) basically represents the percentage of total sales of a given product your company is receiving. If you sell microwaves and have 20% market share, it means 1/5 people are buying their microwave from you.\n\nIt shows how dominant you are relative to your competitors.\n\nHowever, what can be more meaningful is the *change* in market share. If you are losing market share, it may mean customers are choosing other products over yours. If you're gaining, it shows that you are growing by becoming more popular.\n\nHowever there is an important caveat here - the EV market is growing very rapidly. Tesla, as basically second mover in the EV market (after Nissan Leaf) and first dominant company in EVs, *will* lose market share, simply because the market is growing *faster* then Tesla can grow (even though [Tesla is growing extremely quickly each year](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tesla_Charts/comments/101ipz7/tesla_growth_since_model_s_launch_2022_edition/)).\n\nIf 10,000 microwaves are sold to early adopters five years after microwaves are invented, your company may sell 75% of them, or 7,500. The next year, microwave sales take off like crazy as people learn about them. Numerous other companies enter the market, selling their own microwaves.\n\nIf you 5x your sales the next year to 37,500, but the total number of microwaves sold 10x's to 100,000, you now only have 37.5% market share, a *decline* in market share, even though your company is growing rapidly, and expects to sell 80,000 microwaves next year and make tons more money.\n\nThis is similar to what's happening with Tesla. They are growing very rapidly, but the market is growing more quickly, meaning they are losing market share despite their growth.\n\nThis is different from a scenario where your microwaves don't have advanced features offered by competitors, or are more expensive, and customers stop buying your microwaves. That would be an instance where losing market share would be an indicator that your company's value is declining.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the comprehensive reply!\n\nIt seems complicated to get any meaningful value from data about market share if the market is changing rapidly.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, it's not very indicative of anything at this point. Also note there is ambiguity around the term \"EV\" which can mean:\n\n* HEV - hybrid electric vehicle. This has a gasoline engine and small (\\~7-9kWh) battery.\n* PHEV - plugin hybrid electric vehicle. This has a slightly larger battery and can be plugged in to charge the battery. Trips of approximately 20 miles can be made on battery alone. This also has a gasoline engine.\n* FCEV - Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle. This uses a hydrogen fuel cell and does not have a gasoline engine. These are not common nor a large factor in the EV market.\n* BEV - What everyone means when they say electric car. Tesla, Nissan Leaf, Chevy Bolt, etc. This runs off batteries and electric motors alone and does not have a gasoline engine.\n\nWhen they say \"BYD passed Tesla as largest EV manufacturer\" they are counting a lot of PHEV hybrids which have gasoline engines. BYD makes both PHEV and BEV.\n\nTesla makes BEV *only* and is still the global leader in BEV sales. BYD *could* pass Tesla perhaps in early 2024 for BEV production, depending on how things go, but Tesla could also hold them off.\n\nBYD (essentially China only right now) and Tesla appear to be the two global leaders in BEVs with Volkswagen a distant third and perhaps Stellantis (owners of Chrysler, Fiat, Pugeot, etc) third because of strong sales in Europe.\n\nToyota is a laggard and Hyundai/Kia are ramping up now.
