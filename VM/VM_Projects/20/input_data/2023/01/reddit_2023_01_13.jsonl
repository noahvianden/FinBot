Alot of those commodities i mention peaked between Mar and May, bottomed in November, and have recovered a little since. And Teslas COGS haven't gone down at all that whole time.\n\nSo, there's clearly some lag time between commodities prices and Tesla's COGS and it makes you wonder why? Maybe their price agreements only adjust once a year, or every 6 months. Or maybe they buy enough of everything they need for 2 quarters once every 6 months?\n\nIt is kind of curious though, why we haven't seen COGS drop yet.\n\nEdit: Actually average COGS did drop in Q3 by about 2k or 5% QoQ. But what's even stranger is how average COGS were nearly flat for 9months from Q3 2021-Q1 2022 at around 36-36.5K despite the rapid rise in commodities prices during that time. Then a sudden jump to 41.5K all at once in Q2 2022, and back down to 39.3k in Q3 2022. So, seems like it wouldn't be unprecedented to see at least a 5K COGS reduction over one quarter (and probably due to commodities alone). So, add improved margins from Austin+Berlin, economies of scale, and 100% revenue recognition from FSD... maybe they can actually get +$10K in margins back from all of that.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "The revenue hit is straight forward\n\nPrice cuts * volume \n\nWithout any real data, I’d just assume 1/2 of the cut gets offset.

That’s a very heavy lift, I don’t think it is conservative at all\n\nI think $5K is likely. Keep in mind i'm talking about over 2 quarters here - Q4 and Q1.\n\nSo let's see, assuming in Q1 Austin and Berlin are sufficiently ramped and no longer weighing onmargins that would contribute +3.3% margins of Q3 ASPs of $53.5k.\n\nSo that's +$1766.\n\nThen we have FSD, another big assumption. If, however, they can now recognize 100% of revenue, and if they were only recognizing 60% previously, that's $15,000x0.4x0.14x0.9 = $756.\n\nSo, we're at +$2522 before any COGS reduction from commodities deflation/supply chains/economies of scale.\n\nHard to estimate what commodities deflation will contribute because we don't know how much each one adds to the total cost. However, we can probably safely use 14% as a floor because that is the minimum decline of all of them. 14% of $39.3K is $5.5k.\n\nSo that's already $8k, but maybe i'm too optimistic on commodities.\n\nThen there's economies of scale which is hard to estimate but i think there's a clue between Q2 and Q3 2022 COGS. Q2 COGS were \\~$41.5K then in Q3 they fell to $39.3k. The weird thing however is how quickly those COGS fell when they took so long to rise. Which leads me to believe the COGS drop in Q3 actually was not due to commodities deflation but economies of scale. Further supporting this idea is the production/delivery numbers in both quarters. In Q2 deliveries werejust 254,695 because of covid shutodwns. Then in Q3 deliveries increased by 89,135 to 343,830. Assuming i'm right about this, that suggests Tesla's COGS could drop by another \\~$2k as production ramps from 343,830 to \\~430,000+ in Q1 2023.\n\nSo now we're at $10k. Which almost completely offsets the majority of price cuts for the Model Y, and more than offsets double the price cut for the Model 3 RWD.\n\nImportant to keep in mind if Tesla COGS fall by even $5k, or half my estimate, and Tesla cut prices on the M3 RWD by just $3k - margins will actually increase! And the M3 RWD trim is the most popular of the the M3s. On the other hand, at +$5k, you're only making up half the loss on the Model Y LR and other trims which saw -$13k price cuts or more - but you're making up for some of that with gains from the M3 RWD.\n\nAnd none of this considers margin improvement from the eventual use of 4680 structural pack and front+rear gigacast. Meaning as Tesla ramps production of those cars throughout 2023, margins will further improve. Assuming they ramp Austin and Berlin Model Y production to 500k each by 2024, and assuming just 250k cars from each factory have 4680 structural packs in 2024, if the new design improves margins by 5%, then those 500k cars might contribute 1% margin in 2024 depending on how many cars they deliver total that year. And this will increase over time as more of the production lines are switched over to the new production design.\n\nAnyway thanks for pushing back against my ideas.

{"title": "TSLA Tesla Evaluation - Fundamental Analysis", "selftext": "Hello Investors and Gamblers! We all know what Tesla is, but do we really know what it is worth? Are you bagholding and want to know if you shall cut losses or hold it to the core of the Earth? Or are you looking for a good entry price for a heavy Call or Put slapping?\n\nWell you came to the righ post! Here i am evaluating TSLA Fair Value for you! Hope you enjoy the reading! And don't forget to share with the community your thought and prayers! Cheers!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Purpose**\n\nThe purpose of this thesis is to analyse the development of Tesla during the past three years, from 2019 to 2022. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration. In addition, a comparison to its main competitors and the market situation is also made. All is made to determine the fair value of the stock price and determine the investment strategy. All is made to answer the following questions:\n\n* What is its position compared to competitors?\n* Is the company fairly valued by the market by its fundamentals?\n* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?\n\n**Delimitations and Assumptions**\n\nThis thesis is delimited to an analysis of TSLA between the years 2019 and 2022. The thesis is based on the assumption that TSLA is the one of the most trending automotive company in the world, and that the prestige it has will support its price action in the next months.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nIn this thesis, data from its financial statements are taken from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance and other publicly available information on the company on-line. The Company valuation is made based on:\n\n* Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula\n* Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model\n* Discounted Cash Flow Model\n\n**Hypothesis**\n\n* US next interest rates hike of 25-50bps\n* Inflation of 6.5% and cooling down to 6% for January 2023\n* TSLA is high volume stock\n* TSLA is overvalued\n* There are many TSLA bagholders\n* TSLA can’t outproduce its competitors in the near nor mid term\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Methodology\n\nThe thesis used macroeconomics data from the 13th of January 2023 for its valuations, Income Statements, Balance Sheets and Cash Flow are considered and projected to the next three years. The final price tag is obtained by the average of three valuation methodology: Graham Formula, Discounted Cash Flow and Cash Flow Evaluation. It is then given a 20% margin of error in both direction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Data|Value|Source|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Levered Beta**|2.03|[Yahoo Finance, 5y monthly](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA?p=TSLA&.tsrc=fin-srch)|\n|**Unlevered Beta**|**1.99**|Calculation|\n|**CAPM**|**15.25%**|Calculation|\n|**WACC**|**12.84%**|Calculation|\n|**ROE**|**24.40%**|[Next Year’s Analyst Growth Estimate](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/analysis?p=TSLA)|\n|**EPS**|**3.24**|[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA?p=TSLA)|\n|**P/E**|**37.18**|[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA?p=TSLA)|\n|**PEG ratio**|**2,13**|Calculation|\n|**Growth Rate Estimate**|**24.40%**|[Analysts](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/analysis?p=TSLA)|\n|Intel’s Corporate Bonds|4.77%|[Business Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/bonds/intel_corpdl-notes_201212-42-bond-2042-us458140ap51?miRedirects=1)|\n|Outstanding Shares|3,157,752,000|Excel Data Type|\n\n# Macro Economic Data\n\n|Data|Value|Source|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Market Expected Return|9.40%|[Motley Fools, 50y average market return (1972-2021)](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/average-stock-market-return/)|\n|Risk Free Rate|3.48%|[Yahoo Finance, 10y US Treasury Bonds](https://finance.yahoo.com/bonds)|\n|Risk Premium|5.29%|calculation|\n|AAA Bond Yield|4.40%|[Moody's Seasoned AAA Corporate Bond Yield](https://ycharts.com/indicators/moodys_seasoned_aaa_corporate_bond_yield)|\n|Average US GDP Growth|3.18%|[Tradingeconomics - Average US GDP growth rate (1947-2022)](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/gdp-growth)|\n|Current Market P/E|20.72|[Multpl.com ](https://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-pe-ratio)|\n|US interest Rate|4.40%|[Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/interest-rate)|\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Evaluation Methods\n\nIn this paper, three methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Growth Rate\n\n**The Growth Rate of 24.40%** is determined by the average analysts consensus for the company’s next year growth rate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model\n\nThis simple model takes in mind the company last year’s available cash flow data, its WACC based discount rate of 12,84% and its Growth Rate of 24,40% to determine a fair value of **$78.88** per share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula\n\nThis model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing. This thesis uses the adjusted formula to better adjust it to the current market environment.\n\nData used for the calculation:\n\n|Data|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|EPS|3.24|\n|Growth Rate|24.40|\n|AAA Bond Yield|4.40|\n\nThe Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$101.74**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Discounted Cash Flow Model\n\nThis thesis uses Free Cash Flow, gained by subtraction Capex from Cash floe From Operations. Free cash flow (FCF) is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable\n\nIn simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.\n\nIn this model, it is taken in mind the following data:\n\n|Data|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|WACC based discount rate|12.84%|\n|Growth rate|24.40%|\n|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|\n|Average Shares outstanding|3,157,752,000|\n\nWhich projected a FCF for the next five years as per follow:\n\nNote: the projection is based on the assumption the company will keep growing by a perpetual rate of 24.40%, which is highly improbable due to unknown future events and variations in the market. This shall be taken only as an indicative forecast.\n\nThe calculation gives us a Fair Value of **$70.99** per share\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Final Fair Value\n\nThe Final price tag is determined as per following:\n\n|Data|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|$78,88|\n|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|$101.74|\n|Discounted Free Cash Flow Model|$70.99|\n|**Final Price + 20% error margin**|**$104.83**|\n|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$83.87**|\n|**Final Price - 20% error margin**|**$62.90**|\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Products\n\nTesla recently lowered their products price tag amid demand fall. Here are listed the current price tag as of 13th January 2023:\n\n* **Tesla Model X** $109,990\n* **Tesla Model 3** $43,990\n* **Tesla Model Y** $52,990\n* **Tesla Model S** $94,990\n\nTotal worldwide unit sold in thousands:\n\n* 2022: 1,313\n* 2021: 935\n* 2020: 367\n* 2018: 244\n\nWe can observe a 40% increase of Unit sold in 2022.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Insider Transactions\n\nThere are heavy and frequent sell activity from insiders of the company from all departments, biggest drop of shares come from the CEO itself.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kbzsu9skovba1.png?width=1486&format=png&auto=webp&s=187f76372cbaa2b741dbddb492d35a6bcedd8ced\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# SWOT ANALYSIS\n\nStrengths\n\n* **Most Valuable Automotive Company**: It is currently the the automotive company with the highest market capitalisation.\n* **Tesla Increased its Electric Vehicle Delivery**: In 2022 it increased its deliveries of 40% from 935 thousands  to 1.3 million units.\n* **Cross-sell and Diversification**: Tesla has comprehensive insurance program for its vehicles in association with Liberty Mutual insurance company.\n* **Innovative Company**: Tesla has a very high rate of innovation, the market expects the company to develop competitive and profitable products.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n* **Manufacturing Complications**: Tesla faces continuous launch, manufacturing and production ramp delays while launching their new vehicles and other products. For example, Tesla faced endless manufacturing challenges when they were about to launch Model X, which lead to constant delays for distribution. Similarly, the company went through extreme troubles while manufacturing Model X’s battery module assembly line at Gigafactory 1.\n* **Unable to meet demand might affect brand value**: Due to highly experimenting and complicated procedures, Tesla’ might face an unbalanced supply and demand, unable to meet the production ramp.\n* **Lack of High Volume Productio**n: It has failed to produce high volumes of automobiles for any of its models. Even now, as the company plans to manufacture Model 3 vehicles at high volume, it faces issues in terms of production cost and management resources.\n* **Shortage of Batterie**s: The shortage directly affectes the sales of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.\n* **Elon Musk as Tesla’s Sole Representative**: Musk is deeply involved in other projects and side quests.\n* **Financial Uncertainty**: Tesla has outstanding debt of $5.38 Billion. If the company is unable to generate enough cash flow to repay its debt, then there is a risk of delaying expansion, reducing investments, selling assets, etc.\n* **Employee Safety Concerns**: Tesla was recently fined in 2019 for creating a tent production line without a permit or safety inspection. Also, the company did not train workers about the risks of working in the tent for long periods under the scorching California’s heat.\n* **Leadership Wrangles**: Friction and conflict between management and the board of directors can undermine productivity and long-term success. Tesla’s management and board have been engaged in several power struggles.\n* **Tesla Faces Lawsuit over Sexual Misconduct**: Many Tesla workers filed a lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct and harassment at the workplace. The women have complained that the company fosters a dark culture of sexual misconduct. They also alleged that they were cat-called and were frequently subjected to shameful remarks, groping, and misogynistic behaviour.\n\n## Opportunities\n\n* **Sales expansion in untapped Market**: The most significant opportunity for the company right now is the Asian market, even tho there are increased risks.\n* **Less Expensive Car**: Tesla’s Model 3 is a more affordable version of Model S with less range, power, and fewer features.\n* **Bringing battery production technology in-house**: Tesla intends to make its own battery cells.\n* **Market Confidence in Tesla**: The stock market has shown confidence in Tesla after beating the projected car deliveries.\n\n## Threats\n\n* **Product Liability Claims**: The company has faced lawsuits and claims related to the failure of technology in their products. If these liability claims continued, then Tesla may be subjected to greater financial setbacks.\n* **Extensive Competition**: Tesla, Inc. faces aggressive competition from both alternative fuel vehicles (Hybrid, Plug-in hybrid, fully electric car) and self-driving technology. Many automotive brands in the luxury segment like Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lexus and in the economy segment like Toyota, Ford, General Motors , Volvo are getting ready for a fierce competition. Many brands are not only launching or planning to launch their environment-friendly-Self-driving technology but also, they are offering them at a comparably lower price.\n* **Product Defects**: Tesla’s cars and other energy products have exhibited major flaws in many cases. The defective products often have weaknesses in design, manufacturing, and other features which harm the company’s image permanently.\n* **Long term confidence**: Tesla, due to its unstable manufacturing conditions, suffers from disbelief among the public about its long-term existence, which can result in a deficiency in further business development.\n* **Customer Adaptation**: The company highly depends upon customers willingness to adopt electric vehicles.\n* **Disruption of Supply Due to Shortage of Materials**: Tesla can face major suspensions in the supply of manufacturing materials due to the increased prices. The company uses aluminum, steel, lithium, nickel, copper, and cobalt, as well as lithium-ion cells from suppliers. All these materials have volatile prices, which can affect the company’s production line severely in the future.\n* **High-Risk Factor Due to Usage of Lithium-ion**: Tesla uses lithium-ion cells in their battery packs. Lithium is a highly reactive and explosive element, which increases the risk factor of our products. Tesla has faced a a few cases where their cars have caught fire and vented smoke, which has defamed the company on a major level.\n* **Elon Musk’s Behavior Affecting Tesla’s Reputation**: Tesla’s entire reputation is built upon the cult of Elon Musk. But recently, his waky behavior and impulsive reactions are affecting Tesla.\n* **Competitors increasing productions of EV Vehicles**: Competitors are jumping in the EV segment eating huge portions of the market share.\n\n# Analysts Price Target\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4wn0aagnvba1.png?width=931&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa3454ea3abf822fb499df3e464796fb3e2494ba", "id": "10b638t", "created_utc": 1673645273.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "It's been a long ass time since we've had actual attempts at DD in the investment subs.

I think with the recent price drops, we should expect this growth to go down more, but no one knows by how much.\n\nI believe 24.4% is too high but if they execute perfectly, they can achieve it. But it's really difficult and few companies are capable of pulling it off.\n\n> Tesla has a very high rate of innovation, the market expects the company to develop competitive and profitable products.\n\nI think this strength is mostly gone. Their product roadmap includes the Model 2, Cybertruck, Semi, and full FSD. These have been on the radar for awhile and there are other companies beating them to the punch in each of these markets. BYD is beating them in battery tech as well. Looking at their R&D spend compared to other companies, this isn't a surprise.\n\n> Manufacturing Complications\n\nI actually think manufacturing is a strength. They've shown to be incredibly nimble during the chip shortage. They also managed to keep costs under control. Compared to other companies who historically ramp up to 1M units, they did well. The QA is questionable but I don't know how bad it is. They're definitely not Toyota, but maybe still better than say VW.\n\n> Product Liability Claims\n\nThis is the greatest present threat to Tesla. It's why Musk started censoring the guy that put the 8 car crash video online. There's a lot more complaints and evidence collected by national agencies. NHTSA is going after their FSD Beta for public endangerment and it's going to get heated.\n\n> Market Confidence in Tesla\n\nParticularly, among retail investors, this stock is so strong, even with Musk proving to be a tool.

Not sure what most of it is.\n\nMy price target was under 100 by next Fall. I made it a bit over a month ago before Tesla dropped 50%.\n\nNow my price target is less than 50$.\n\nWhy? Let me count the ways.\n\n1. Russo-Ukraine War. Two thirds of worlds pig iron produced in Ukraine and Russia. Ukraine production is in ruins or without power (Zaporozhye Nuclear Plant ring a bell?)\n\n2. The full Tesla thesis will require a 10x increase in Lithium production in 10 years and a doubling or more of nickel, chromium, molybdemun, and other minerals as well. Throughought human history no nation or society has been able to double production of a mainline commodity in 10 years. Now that Russia is out there is no way future production goals can be met. Add in inflation and high interest rates and it complicates this further.\n\n3. China is a wreck. Millions of new Covid cases a day. People refusing to pay mortgages because real estate developers stole their money. Riots. And Xi sitting on top of it all without any competent lieutenants because he purged everyone that might challenge him. China will be lucky to be a single country by the end of the decade. GigaChina is probably going to be a total write off. Oh, did I mention that China's population actually peaked a decade ago and there are about 100 million more males than females. Population bust means that China won't even have high consumption. Both Apple and Tesla should have left two years ago.\n\n4. GigaBerlin has some of the most expensive energy in the Western Hemisphere. It's going to cut into Tesla's margins and maybe make then unprofitable. Europe IS in recession (China too) and that means lower consumption. BASF moved its entire operations to Louisiana because without natural gas they cannot compete.\n\n5. Musk bought Twitter and pissed off all the Libs who are Tesla's best customers. They'll be more receptive to the truth. Tesla's cars are not green. They require a lot of expensive materials that are all produced in high polluting and carbon intensive industries. It takes a decade or more to break even on the carbon debt of producing a Tesla. Plus, Tesla's are a luxury car. They are usually people's third vehicle. In the coming recession luxury purchases always fall.\n\nFor these reasons and the shitty economic outlook it think 50$ is generous. I think its ACTUAL value is probably less than Ford. But people bought a dream that would save the climate. They won't believe it's not true for a long time.

Astronauts on the space station have severe health issues just from a few months in space, let alone all the tons of tons of equipment they would have to ship there.  \n\n\nMany of these plans are just presented as mind-blowing and really great stories that are unfortunately not founded in reality... just to seem so visionary and get rich off.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "https://youtu.be/ZbTFrZYfP3Y check out the YouTube account FSD working.
