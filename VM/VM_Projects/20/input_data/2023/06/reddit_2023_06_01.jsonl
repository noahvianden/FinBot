I mean, yea, it's cool, but what can it really do that's of value to businesses?\"\n\nThese people are completely ignoring the actual motivator of the increase in demand for GPUs: locally-hosted open-source AIs. Google's leaked memo states that they expect to be outpaced by open-source models (which is currently happening). By the end of the year, the best LLMs on the market will be open source and capable of being run on in-house machines without using the internet. This enables companies to use them without worrying about confidentiality. These models are not simply turn key solutions but rather the starting point that you can customize via \"fine-tuning\" (amongst other things) on whatever dataset you have without sacrificing confidentiality.\n\nAnd that's just addressing the \"ChatGPT-like LLMs\". There is a vast variety of other models that are specialized to perform various tasks. They require fewer resources to run but are only good at doing a certain thing (e.g. classification, sentiment analysis, keyword generation, embeddings, etc). However, if you're running specialized models, you're probably running several of them and piping them together in order to accomplish a larger overall task. There's thousands of such models and it seems I don't go a week without hearing about yet another record-breaking model being released. *That* is what's driving this. ChatGPT and MidJourney and all of that are the tip of a very large iceberg. Most of the rest of it is [in here](https://huggingface.co/models).\n\nThe catch to all of this, though, is that in order to run these, you need a very large GPU (far beyond what a gamer would be expected to buy).\n\nAnd yet, I see basically zero users in this subreddit ever making even a reference to any of this.

If by expiration ATVI is $95 the position will net around $15 profit, similar to just holding stock (assuming you bought at $80) because they have the same/similar positive delta.\n\nA ZEBRA is defined risk so if ATVI craters you could lose the $12.80 by expiration if the long calls are out of the money, but no more.  If by expiration ATVI is $60 you lose $12.80 vs $20.00 with stock... \n\nHowever the options *will* expire so this is where stock can be superior, because you can just hold on and hope.
