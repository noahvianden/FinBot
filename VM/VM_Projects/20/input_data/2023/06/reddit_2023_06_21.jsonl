{"title": "Capital One Financial Corp (COF): A Deep Dive into Potential Bearish Indicators", "selftext": "Hello fellow traders,\n\nI've been conducting an in-depth analysis on Capital One Financial Corporation (COF), and have stumbled upon several intriguing data points that seem to imply a potentially bearish trend. Here is what I‚Äôve pieced together:\n\n1.\t**Credit Card Debt Exposure**: Capital One‚Äôs exposure to credit card debt is quite significant. As of the end of 2022, they held $138 billion in credit card loans, which accounted for around 44% of their total loan portfolio. Given this heavy exposure, any uptick in defaults or borrowing costs could severely impact the company‚Äôs stability. In a hypothetical moderate recession, there is a possibility that Capital One's CET1 ratio may plummet and the company's balance sheet equity value could see a reduction by half or even more.\n\n2.\t**U.S. Credit Card Debt Trends**: Credit card debt in the United States skyrocketed to an unprecedented $930.6 billion in Q4 of 2022. Additionally, there has been an increase in delinquencies. With credit card annual percentage rates averaging near 20% and potentially rising further, this development is worrisome. Particularly as consumers are increasingly reliant on credit to manage the soaring costs of basic necessities such as groceries and rent.\n\n3.\t**Congressional Stock Trading**: Noteworthy trades involving COF by members of Congress have been reported. Specifically, Representative French Hill offloaded COF shares multiple times in May 2023.\n\n4.\t**Lobbying Expenditure**: In the first quarter of 2023, Capital One expended $630,000 on lobbying efforts, chiefly on banking, finance, and tax matters. This raises the question if they are seeking to sway legislation in an attempt to cushion potential risks.\n\n5.\t**Insider Trading**: A trend has emerged of more COF shares being sold than purchased by insiders. For instance, on June 2, 2023, Mouadeb Mark Daniel sold 469 shares, and on February 14, 2023, Blinde Neal unloaded 8000 shares.\n\n6.\t**Legislative Developments**: Legislation such as the ‚ÄúCredit Card Competition Act of 2022‚Äù have been introduced, which could carry ramifications for the credit card industry and specifically for COF.\n\nWhile these data points are far from conclusive, they certainly raise some red flags. I would love to hear your insights on this matter. How do you interpret these data points? Do you believe that these factors could precipitate a bearish trajectory for COF? And most importantly :why isn't it bearish yet?", "id": "14fd5gz", "created_utc": 1687366765.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|6|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: There are several potential warning signs for Capital One Financial Corporation, including heavy credit card debt exposure, increasing delinquencies, stock selling by members of Congress, and insider selling.

COF's exposure to credit card debt could make it vulnerable to economic downturns or interest rate increases.\n\nLong-Term Outlook: Monitoring P/E ratios, funding costs, and interest rate dynamics is essential.
