And everything in between from the supply chain to the refineries. \n\nIf people who had called $100+ had looked at those, they would have instead had more expectations below $90. \n\n# But let's look at the present situation.\n\nThere's a ton of factors, and I recommend doing your own research and looking at each one yourself. It's a complex picture, with many moving parts. \n\nBut one of the factors worth mentioning is Russia having to desperately unload its oil for cheap and flooding the market. On top of the gap between output and target cuts, this has also negated any of the few OPEC countries that had any real changes in output.\n\nHowever, after a year of being bearish on oil prices, I'm no longer as bearish as I once was.\n\nBut I'm not bullish yet, just a little less bearish. I just think the downtrend will slow and stabilize. \n\n...barring any recession, housing market crash, wild OPEC shift, that could re-accelerate the downtrend. \n\nAnd that's a big if. Since I'm not feeling positive about the housing market right now, and can really see a correction. That could potentially affect the market demand. \n\nPlus we are currently in the prime season for oil demand. We'll be heading into the weaker months at the end of the year. \n\nI can see the downtrend slowing and stabilizing at best. But I'm still not seeing a big come back, or oil prices back above $100 this year.\n\nMaybe next year oil bulls. \n\n# The stock side\n\nWe could however see more positives for the stock side in the energy industry.\n\nThis is where I might be even less bearish, and slightly becoming bullish. \n\nLooking beyond just the commodity side itself, the industry related stocks have actually not been doing that bad, all things considered. XOM, CVX, and Shell, have had somewhat of a stable trend to a mild downward trend for the past year. Smaller stock in things like oil exploration, shale industry, etc... have been a little more volatile. \n\nIf you believe the current stock market rally is part of a long term trend for a next bull cycle, and not a bull trap, then the oil industry related stocks might be worth looking into. There is a potential for a much more positive oil market next year, and maybe more stability as early as this year. \n\nYou also have to believe that there is no further threat of recession or some housing market crash.\n\nAnd you have to believe that we're not quiet there yet with renewable energy, with electric cars, and that China, India, and Brazil will outpace that with high demand for a lot of fossil fuel vehicles. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "14kihdk", "created_utc": 1687883708.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "I'm honestly surprised that there hasn't been an issue at a refinery in the us this summer.
