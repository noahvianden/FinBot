SIVB like black swan situations can happen to any company.  I am currently in AAP bag holding after a 40% drop, and it’s fine when it is just one contract.  I will slowly lower the cost and exit in about two years hopefully.  Also, I am debating in my own head that it appears selling atm puts 180dte may be not too bad considering 50% trades will at sometime benefit from Vega.  And some hedging can be done using short term put buying.

Lost income due to a rapid price rise will never offset the smaller income from selling CCs. If you are in a sideways or downward market them selling CCs generates extra money safely. The  problem is determing which type of market you are in.\n\nIf you buy lower tier or riskier beaten down tech stocks, then you are tying up your money waiting for them to recover. These have a bit less volatility or chance of a 30-45 DTE hitting your strike (if selected properly). That said the amount of money earned on these isn't great compared to either the risk/reward of holding them (stock dropping further) vs earning premiums on CCs.\n\nAlso, for me the amount of money generated with the Wheel hasn't been that exciting/enticing.\n\nI focus on opportunities where either I'm very happy with the premium or I want out or in a stock.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Agree on the picking the correct sector.

I've done really well with  CSP/CC on OXY/MRO.\n\nBanks - high IV and it has tanked this year so your underlying would have lost money.  JPM,C, WFC has been good for selling options\n\nUtilities - low IV\n\nREITS- don't bother, low IV and they are slowly tanking\n\nConsumer staples- not too bad, some have higher IV and they don't move as fast.  KHC, K, PG are decent not great for sellers.\n\nRetail - high IV but moves fast.
