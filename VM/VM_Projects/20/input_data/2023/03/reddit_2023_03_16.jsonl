{"title": "Us stocks rise ahead of Fed meeting, Wall Street is happy.", "selftext": "All three indexes surged, led by the Nasdaq, which rose 2.6%. The market has been pretty extreme. Nasdaq was back in my short range after a day's rally. I made a smart move to take advantage of the Credit Suisse storm yesterday.\n\nToday I open short positions, yesterday still think should choose the opportunity to buy bottom, today's action is in the opposite direction. First of all, the financial environment in the United States is not good. Last Thursday, there was a sudden explosion of SVB, and a Credit Suisse was also exploded in the middle. Now the price of QQQ is 3% higher than last week. 2, today, the European Central Bank as scheduled to raise interest rates by 50 basis points, after Europe's planned action is actually to give the Federal Reserve a lot of pressure, if the United States does not continue to raise interest rates, the credit of the Federal Reserve is damaged, but if the interest rate increase I think may become the last straw that breaks the camel's back, the previous interest rate increase has let a number of small banks can only survive; 3. Short selling near 307 has a good risk-return ratio. Near 310 is a very important resistance level in the early stage, while strong support is near 294. 4. According to my previous calculations, we are on the eve of this bear market's usual gradual weakening three trading days before the Fed meeting.\n\nThere are some optimistic signs in the market, such as the rescue of Credit Suisse and the possible liquidity injection from big banks. However, the root cause of the problem is the tightening policy of the Federal Reserve, and such rescue cannot solve the problem at the root. I thought yesterday that the probability of the Federal Reserve not raising interest rates is higher, which is based on the panic of the financial market and the crisis of the banking system, but if the QQQ is about to hit a new high this year, These banks have also received short-term assistance, plus the European interest rate hike as scheduled, so what obstacles POWELL has to raise interest rates, but once the Fed insists on raising interest rates by 25 basis points, I don't know what camels will be crushed to death. QQQ broke through the technical resistance near 298 today and rose to 306 at one point. The next strong technical resistance is near 310. If QQQ can effectively break through, it is likely that there is some new news on monetary policy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m6dudxf7s6oa1.jpg?width=716&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bdf2b7771a2358dc213fe4fa3bd3062c6ce160cd\n\nUs dollar:\n\nIt was really a one-day move. Yesterday we saw safe-haven flows because of Credit Suisse's concerns, but today the ECB duly raised rates and the euro rallied quite a bit. The technical chart of the dollar index looks to be walking in a small box, the current direction is still not clear, the final direction is still to see the Fed meeting policy guidance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4inuvze8s6oa1.png?width=879&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f3395543f98353ab9aec4403493a6c6a55f85f6\n\nGold:\n\nContinued the previous high volatility, although the close today is a small cross star, slightly up, but the lines are very long, gold investors are very divided, the risk seems to be fading in the financial market, the enthusiasm for gold is dissipating, and the Federal Reserve policy is also very uncertain, so the withdrawal of funds is completely understandable, from the trading level, Gold's $120 rally in just one week is a bit excessive in the short term and needs a correction. The previous good performance of the company today is +2% down, gold shares are usually the leading indicator of gold, their weakness also makes me think that the probability of short-term adjustment of gold is greater.\n\n[ That's all for today.

Congress has to fix those, but they need to work in tandem with the Fed.

This happens when usually inflation is high according to public or market perception. Generally, the equation is if x > 3.8%-4% where x is current CPI number.\n\n\\- Negative Correlation: When equities move down and bond price move up ( yield down ) or the opposite when equities move up and bond price move down ( yields up ) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent situation : Bond price up , Equities down \n\nNow, this is happening either due to the flight to safety trade coz the recession is about to begin anytime soon or has started. Or the reason is inflation is about to fall off the cliff soon and hence equation is about to be x < 4%. Sometimes it also could be a financial disaster coming which will cause a deflationary death spiral and a shock to the system. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nQE vs Not QE\n\nPermanent market operations are called QE where Fed buys MBS & TBS and take duration away from the markets. This causes bond yields to go down and hence drive interest rates low. Current operations are called temporary market operations where Fed loans money and banks post collateral like TBS and MBS or agency bonds. This is called \"Not QE\" imo or transitory QE whatever you wanna call it. This will cause no changes to the money supply and hence not inflationary. It also happened in 2008 when Fed lent the money to banks and banks then redeposited at Fed.\n\nSo basically in finance, there is this thing called \"Communication smthing\" where you have to reassure the public they are doing something coz the whole system is dependent on trust. It's like what Greenspan said that monetary policy is 97% talk. So if the trust in the system is broken ofc the whole system will collapse and it doesn't matter what you do other than changing the whole system ( could be CBDCs coming ) These pt of changes could potentially be where the concept of Fourth turing starts.

Now this is where trust needs to be developed which tbh takes a lot of time and just cannot be mended in few days.\n\n\nWhen i said yields go down i meant both front and back end.
