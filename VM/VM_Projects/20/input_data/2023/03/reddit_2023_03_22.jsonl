{"title": "Think I nailed the Q1/Q2 market maker swings", "selftext": "Macro events aside , think I just nailed my Q1 /Q2 thesis on the market maker swings\n\nBeen sizing this up since Jan 1 (drops ) and then the Quad Witch of Jan 21 (1st fake rally) . It helped me develop a theory that allowed me to nail the swings today .\n\nTheory : \n- Triple and Quad witch index  call options that opened middle of last year were bought en masse by the banks . Those dates are key, because the banks will win on those bets .  That’s March 17, June 16, and Sept 15 . \n\n- The near and mid term options that opened shortly after the Quad Witch Day , that are in between that day and the next Quad Witch are a bank hedge, and a retail trap. Between SPY and QQQ…the bigs are typically the wealthy ones with enough shares in holdings to sell fresh call options . They are the seller of these fresh, near term options . \n\n- CPI and PPI and fed rate dates happen in between . General market consensus Forrest-through-trees is 2024 is latest for market to recover (Those are the nearest term calls available after September btw ). \n\n- If the market trades sideways first half of the year , max pain for retail is down/flat during the in- between weeks of quad witch . That means retail loses on those fresh, less expensive calls that suddenly open during a rally . Bigs collect time premium . They sell old shares to aid the process . \n\n- Retail either sells at a partial or total loss, or jumps to next week waiting on the recovery . \n\n- Bigs then use fresh profits from collecting time premium (selling all of us stupid retailers the near term calls ), and average back into their holdings for a quad witch rally . That was this las few trading days . \n\n\nWhat I did :\n\n- I’m not into charts but Nasdaq clearly has its resistance points at the major spots (e.g. 11k,11.5k,12k, etc ) \n\n- I bought calls on the last false rally for March 21. I closed some green (SPY and DAPP),  exercised a few, left a couple open (AAPL and Etsy) , and I sold out slowly of the cash call. I had a couple days to watch for the fresh calls to open for the weeks before the next big month available (April 21 has been open for a bit ). \n\n- That day was Friday and Today …..fresh calls available for cheap during a big spike . I sold AAPL and ETSY cheap and trimmed into mutuals . \n\n- When Nasdaq crossed 12k I reversed and bought calls near term calls for the inverse ETFs on all broad indexes (FAZ, SQQQ, SARK, SRS)\n\n\nI effectively made money on both sides testing this theory …..although my technicals are certainly imperfect . I plan on rinse and repeating until June . \n\nThoughts ?", "id": "11ywqvs", "created_utc": 1679519330.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "Idk if you’re right, but this is certainly one of the best things I’ve read today.", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "My technical analysis tells me that nobody knows a damn thing about the market.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "That’s because technical analysis is astrology for finance bros", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Remember past performance isn't guarantee of future returns so let me draw some lines on past performance curves for 100% amazing returns.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Doubt anybody is still paying attention to this , +\\- a day or two this prediction is playing out pretty well", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "likewise", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Just came back to tell you to SMD have a great week", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "So what do you have right now?
