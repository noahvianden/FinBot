JPM actually made $$ today (Friday) & BRK/B lost .39%.  \n\nYour strikes are about 8, 8, & 13 OTM respectively after 2 incredibly bad Market days.  Your question is not whether you will be early assigned, it’s if you still wish to be in these contracts.  You’d love to be early assigned on all of these.  If it could happen this instant, you’d flip the stocks for a $2900 total profit.  It’s not happening.  That’s why.\n\nRolling is premature.  There’s more wiggle room than that.  Rolling to a safer position will not cancel the losses, they become realized losses.  If you’ve done anything right in this, it was not being greedy and picking strikes that survived the last few days of crap.  For that, congratulations.\n\nBest guess is we’ve bottomed or close to it, time decay will start working in your favor, and you’ll start seeing a profit around 25-30dte.  Although yesterday and today were shocking, your contracts are about your perception of the financial condition of the stock on April 21 when opened.  Stay the course.  \n\nMargin is real money.
