{"title": "Janet Yellen's Complete Testimony to the Senate on Joe Biden's Game-Changing Budget Proposal", "selftext": "**Main Point**: The FED can only raise rates and urged congress to do something, Janet Yellen agrees they need to slow down the economy. Their is no bull market, they are going to force a recession.\n\n[this is how I did my DD, it's not my opinion, this is all factual summary of the testimony](https://reddit.com/link/11o2v86/video/ixrcp7s4kzma1/player)\n\n**TL; DR:**\n\nThe article covers various economic topics including Medicare solvency, taxes, IRS data transparency, debt, labor market, and inflation. Treasury Secretary Yellen emphasizes the importance of addressing the tax gap, promoting clean energy, and improving infrastructure. The Inflation Reduction Act and increased funding for the IRS aim to support American businesses and ensure fair taxation. While concerns about government spending and inflation persist, there is a need to invest in infrastructure and support households during difficult economic times. **The chairman suggests slowing down the economy to bring down inflation and questions whether to continue raising interest rates for a second year**. (the dollar will get hit hard over this, buy commodities)\n\n**PROOF OF $26,500 POSITION**: Selling USO cash covered puts, position, I scalp these. #thetagang\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zoc3s306lzma1.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e541b3c5f42b83e001459461868009dca4d95150\n\n**The Entire Summary of What Actually Happened & What Was Said (*****it was a 3 hour testimony*****)**\n\nYellen corrected a mistake about the net investment income and stated that extending Medicare solvency is a priority. The budget proposal calls for $4.7 trillion in new taxes, including a small business surtax and an increase in the death tax.\n\nThe Ways and Means Committee is looking for signs of a strong labor market and putting Americans back to work. The child tax credit was expanded in the American Rescue Plan to help low-income families hit hard by the pandemic.\n\nProPublica obtained a trove of IRS data, raising concerns about tax compliance and transparency. The overall debt is $31 trillion, with small businesses being hit hard, especially those with 50 employees or less.\n\nThe article covers various topics such as Medicare, audit rates on high-income partnerships, clean and renewable energy, disaster relief, mental health, inflation, Social Security, taxes, bank losses, and the IRS. Secretary of State John Kerry expresses concern about the suffering of the American people, particularly those who depend on Social Security as their major source of income in retirement.\n\nTreasury Secretary Yellen monitors recent developments that concern a few banks and expresses disappointment in the administration's budget proposal, which fails to address the real challenges faced by Americans. The article also mentions a Stanford University report that found black taxpayers are disproportionately audited by the IRS, and the new IRS commissioner promises to report on this issue.\n\nThe discussion revolves around various economic policies and proposals presented by different individuals, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, raising corporate tax rates, supply chain problems, the President's budget proposal, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Semiconductor in Chips Act, and the Infrastructure Act.\n\nSome individuals express concerns about deficits, borrowing, inflation, and dependence on other countries, while others emphasize the need to invest in America, create jobs, address issues, and strengthen supply chains. Secretary Yellen also refutes some points made by her colleagues and highlights the importance of closing the tax gap, promoting electric vehicles, and improving infrastructure and digital access.\n\nThe witness claimed that inflation would be temporary and brief, but a year later in June 2022, inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.1. Dealing with inflation is the number one hardship for many Americans. The committee discussed ways to strengthen economic relations with Taiwan, including negotiating an income tax agreement to reduce double taxation on US and Taiwanese businesses.\n\nThe American people need to know that China may not play by the rules, and if necessary, we will tax the income of Chinese companies operating in the United States. The Inflation Reduction Act passed without a single Republican vote and put $80 billion into the IRS to improve its functions. The IRS has answered 90% of its phone calls, squashed its backlog of overdue returns, and introduced new online taxpayer tools.\n\nThe number of audits for taxpayers making less than $400,000 may rise if the size of that population goes up. Screening and document matching for those taxpayers will be increased. The administration is seeking to redefine free trade agreements and include tax parity for Indian Health Services scholarships. The budget does not raise taxes on households or small businesses earning less than $400,000 and pays for initiatives by remedying unfairness.\n\nThe adoption tax credit faced such a high audit rate and what steps have been taken to address this issue. Additionally, it is important to clarify that the taxes proposed in the president's budget are targeted towards high-income individuals and corporations, not small businesses or individuals earning less than $400,000.\n\nThe increase in IRS funding is aimed at improving their ability to serve Americans and ensure that everyone pays their fair share of taxes. The Inflation Reduction Act and Treasury's plan to incentivize domestic manufacturing of solar panels are efforts to support American businesses and reduce reliance on foreign imports. While there may be concerns about the impact of government spending on inflation, it is important to consider the benefits of investing in infrastructure and supporting American households during difficult economic times.\n\nThe article discusses the US government's debt limit and the recent inflation rates. The Treasury Secretary delayed announcing the debt limit until January 13th due to massive spending packages.\n\nPresident Biden was not informed by the White House during negotiations. In May 2021, the chairman believed the inflation was temporary and interest rates would remain low. However, in October 2021, he stated that monthly inflation rates would return to levels close to 2. By June 2022, he admitted that he was wrong about the path inflation would take. The US government has always paid its bills, and US treasuries are considered the safest asset in the financial system. The chairman suggests slowing down the economy to bring down inflation and questions whether to continue raising interest rates for a second year.\n\n**Most Bearish Reason They Have for Why This Is Going to Happen by the FED & US Government**\n\n1.
