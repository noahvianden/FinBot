No comments constitute financial or investment advice. 🌮", "id": "16ggh1x", "created_utc": 1694489410.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 534, "comments": [{"body": "I've read Isaacson's biography of Musk up until the latter chapters about Twitter, but I am going to stop for today because reading non-stop for 8-9 hours is tiring.\n\nMy immediate takeaways:\n\n* Elon's personality is heavily influenced by his father Errol.  The lack of empathy for others, sociopathic behavior, denigrating subordinates and partners as \"stupid\" or worse, sometimes delusional beliefs (examples are FSD claims and \"funding secured\" for taking Tesla private in 2018), are all traits that appear to be either inherited or taught from Errol.\n* **Kimbal Musk probably deserves more credit than he's gotten from the TSLA shareholder community.**   A lot of folks, including me, have criticized Kimbal for giving Elon a free pass, but if Isaacson's reporting is accurate, Kimbal has consistently tried to pull Elon back from the brink of bad decisions.\n* Big TSLA investors have objected to Elon's behavior.  We know that Ron Baron advised Elon to stay off Twitter in 2018.  Isaacson reports that a representative from T. Rowe Price also confronted Elon about his Tweets and stated that T. Rowe Price found Elon's behavior unacceptable.  So it's not just a handful of retail investors who got pissed off about potential brand damage.\n* Elon deserves a lot of credit for his efforts in making Tesla a successful mass manufacturer.     His **willingness to get in the trenches of the assembly lines, and insistence that designers and engineers work in close proximity to assembly workers, are what allowed Tesla to solve its production issues**\n* There's been enormous personal cost many people who worked at Tesla under Elon.  Burnout has been a common experience\n* Compared to Elon Musk, the late Steve Jobs seems like a pretty chill, personable guy who takes his time.  Elon's sense of urgency, and the scope of civilizational transformation he wants to bring, is much more vast than anything Jobs imagined.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn revealed personal dramas:\n\n* Amber Heard is portrayed as a liar and her relationship with Elon described as toxic.  I wrote in an earlier comment that Elon's family was not a fan of his first wife Justine.  They disapproved of Amber *even more*.  She and Elon yelled at each other often during their short time together, and Amber allegedly claimed that Elon had stolen her passport during a vacation (untrue according to Kimbal).  **Kimbal described Amber Heard's toxicity and propensity to lie, as being as bad as that of Errol Musk.**  She's also described as having a personality similar to \"The Joker\", an agent of chaos who sows discord just for the hell of it.  **Edit:** See here for book passages about Amber Heard: [https://www.reddit.com/r/grimezs/comments/16gzkzh/i\\_found\\_it\\_on\\_reddit\\_its\\_the\\_part\\_dedicated\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/grimezs/comments/16gzkzh/i_found_it_on_reddit_its_the_part_dedicated_to/) \n* Claire Boucher (Grimes) has had a similar tumultuous relationship with Elon, though Isaacson observes that she has a gentler personality and seems to unintentionally attract drama rather than deliberately instigate it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite so much of the personal awfulness of Elon Musk that Isaacson documents, I do find it sad that Elon's family, friends, and colleagues, as well as Elon himself, observe that he is an extremely lonely person.  Despite the fact that he is constantly surrounded by people and has many longstanding relationships, he generally feels very apart from others.\n\n* Even as he claims to be very lonely, Elon has an intellectual and spiritual companion in Shivon Zilis, who is running Neuralink.  Shivon says that she has never had an argument with Elon.  She also enjoys playing video games with him.  They don't have a romantic relationship even though they have twin children together, and Zilis seems to have consciously decided against marriage to anyone.  I believe that she'll probably be Elon's best companion and source of stability in the long run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most tragic figure in Isaacson's story is IMO surprisingly not Elon or Claire Boucher (Grimes), but Talulah Riley, Elon's 2nd wife.  It is obvious from Isaacson's writings that Talulah still loves Elon, even though Elon can never reciprocate in the same way or provide the emotional support she needs.  She spent 8 years with Elon and grew very close to his eldest 5 children.  Isaacson describes Talulah's reunion with them around 2021, and states that Talulah broke down in tears when she returned to her boyfriend afterwards.\n\nMost haunting is the promise Talulah made to Elon in 2015 when she decided to divorce him and return to England upon completion of filming for Westworld:\n\n>\"You're my Mr. Rochester\", she said, referring to the brooding husband in Charlotte Bronte's novel *Jane Eyre*.  \"And if Thornfield Hall burns down and you are blind, I'll come to you and take care of you.\"", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for taking the time to write this up.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Sure, anytime!", "score": 5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Elon has that chaotic charisma, all these women got their hearts broken and still love him afterwards.
