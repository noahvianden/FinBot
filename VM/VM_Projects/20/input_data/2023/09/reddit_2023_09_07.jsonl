{"title": "Can Apple Be the Next Big AI Stock?", "selftext": "[https://tokenist.com/can-apple-be-the-next-big-ai-stock/](https://tokenist.com/can-apple-be-the-next-big-ai-stock/)\n\nApple is doubling down on its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities with significant investments in multiple specialized AI teams. Led by John Giannandrea, the company's Head of AI, these units aim to develop advanced models to compete with leading AI technologies by OpenAI and Google. The \"Foundational Models\" team, with about 16 members, is working to enhance Siri and explore AI language models. Other teams focus on visual intelligence and multimodal AI, covering image, video, and text generation. One application under development is an AppleCare chatbot. Apple's internal language model, known as Ajax GPT, is touted to surpass OpenAI's GPT-3.5, having been trained on over 200 billion parameters. CEO Tim Cook emphasizes that Apple's primary aim is not to be first, but to be the best, aligning with his business philosophy.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, Apple faces challenges as rumors circulate that China has banned government officials from using iPhones, affecting the company’s stock prices. China is a critical market and manufacturing hub for Apple, contributing nearly one-fifth of its revenue. This move could have lasting implications for Apple's growth and global market share.", "id": "16ce2eq", "created_utc": 1694088195.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "Apple has leveraged AI in its products for years to [enhance core functionality](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/09/02/how-apple-is-already-using-machine-learning-and-ai-in-ios).

I think someone at Hilton took note that this is an already underserved market demographic that will only become bigger...and what better name in EVs to hitch your name to (especially for charging infrastructure) than Tesla?\n\nYou pose a curious question. In terms of charging infrastructure, I think Tesla is lightyears ahead of most any other company...but all it takes is some money flooded into any current player and that can change. I think it's very similar to how way back in the day when AT&T had exclusive rights to sell the iPhone. AT&T was THE carrier to be at because of that...but Verizon pumped all their money into their infrastructure and built out a solid network. That benefited them a great deal in the long run.\n\nI may be digressing...but there are other major players in the game at the moment, but they have major reliability issues (whether that's factual or more anecdotal). If they were to have a large influx of cash, or a partnership with Marriott and/or another major hotel brand, they could easily fix the reliability issue.\n\nI currently own an EV. I've skipped out on 2 road trips using it because I was nervous about the lack of chargers at my destination...not along the way, but at my destination. I stayed at a Hilton hotel....so if Hilton hotels at destinations have chargers...that makes it MUCH easier to take my EV. That information will get passed on to family and friends and will help EV use grow...and thus begins the cycle.\n\nI've been having some other discussions on this, and the next question to pose is how many chargers should a hotel have? And how fast should they charge? I think quantity is most important right now, but I think one should be able to plug in their car when they roll in at midnight, and leave at 8am with a full charge...so that's important too. Eventually I can see how fast it charges becoming an issue as battery capacity gets bigger...but if charging technology catches up and can charge even faster, then who knows.
