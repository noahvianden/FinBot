Three weeks ago the lower BollingerBand on QQQ was around 360 and rising steadily.

I exited the trade on Aug 16th with 84% profit.  MSFT closed at $316 today, but a few days ago the risk reward was not worth holding out for the extra 16% of premium that was left.\n\nI have another IC on SPY with a 435 short put. When SPY was at 433 this morning, I did not give it a second thought as SPY was well outside the bollingerband and outside 2.5 standard deviations! This is not a common occurrence and the bounce was what I would have expected (I bought 0DTE calls but will save that for WSB). I'll look to see how it reacts on Monday and decide if I roll down, or close the puts and let the call premium run out.\n\nHope this helps.

Just pick a different stock?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This is certainly not financial advice, and you should do what you think is best.\n\nBut with QQQ at the bottom of the band I would consider just writing a put spread. One can write an aggressive (move down in strikes to be conservative) August 25 356 long put / 357 short put, one strike wide, and collect $37 for $100 of margin use. That is a good ROI IMO, but only if one thinks QQQ has a reasonable chance of bouncing back this coming week. And of course that is using quotes on a Saturday morning and we have no idea where QQQ will open on Monday. Max loss is $63 per spread. But be aware, stocks can ride the bottom of the band lower for quite some time, so it can certainly drop lower this week.\n\nI use this example as IC are not one size fits all.  Sometimes I write just one side, you can manage risk by using a small wing spread. If I used a wing spread of 10, the credit on the 8/25 QQQ spread mentioned above would be $257, but the max loss grows to $742. The ROI potential on a 10 wide spread is about 25% ($257 premium / $1000 margin to open). vs. what I view as a less risky trade at 1 wide spread that can earn 37% ROI ($37 premium / $100 margin to open).\n\nThe reason I like shorter dated DTE (right now) is there are options at every strike. When I look at 45 DTE on SPY and QQQ, sometimes you only have 5 wide to chose from. The one wide strikes let me write more contracts and sell portions as profit targets are hit. For example, sell 40% of contracts at 25% profit, 40% more at 50% profit and let the last 20% ride risk free. Others dislike this approach because of the number of contracts and trading costs. \n\nAfter a strong move like this week, I write shorter dated DTE and when the market is stable (in my opinion), I'll go to longer dated DTE. I don't follow, or even pay attention, to the 21 day rule that many talk about. That most likely works for them as they have developed a strategy that profits at 21DTE. But my strategy does not, so if I followed the 21DTE rule, I would lose. Not saying my method is better, it just works for me and what I do.\n\nLots to consider.
