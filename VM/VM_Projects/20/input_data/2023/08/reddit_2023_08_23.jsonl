{"title": "S&P 500 Aug - Oct Historical performances", "selftext": "I was curious about the historic performance of the S&P 500 during these months and found numerous articles written about this occurrence, so I figured I would try to analyze the data.\n\nI made a spreadsheet and calculated the average and a weighted average to account for recency. I plan to create a chart to show this at some point in the near future. \n\nI looked at Daily Chart for $SPY, between 1 Aug and 31 Oct, for the years 2016-2022. I found the biggest price drop in these time periods because of the historic \"trend\" of Aug-Sep having poor market performance; I included Oct just for fun, maybe the pullback was late due to other factors?\n\nOf all of the data, the earliest start of the pullback was 1 Aug (2019) and latest was 31 Oct (2016). The length of time of the pullback was anywhere from 4 days to 69 days (Nice 😎), with an average of 32 days. The % pullback was, from 2016-2022 respectively: -3.30%, -2.84%, -11.38%, -6.36%, -10.86%, -6.10%, and -19.37%.\n\nThe average loss of the trend & timeframe, per year, is -8.60% and calculated, in the style of a WMA, was -10.54%.\n\nI also found a table of CPI (CPI-U) that ranged from 1913-2023, which was based upon 1982, used as a base of 100. The change from July - Oct, of 2016-2022 is as follows (2016 to 2022, respectively): +1.08%, +1.88%, +0.88%, +0.77%, +1.29%, +3.59%, and +1.74%.\n\nI am sure I made some mistakes, but overall, I am confident on my analysis.\n\nOf course, the market doesn't always behave like you would expect it to. We shall see what happens! I'm interested to see if my forecast comes to fruition.\n\nI'm interested to hear any counter-arguments or criticisms, so feel free to poke holes in my work.\n\nLet 'er rip!", "id": "15z219r", "created_utc": 1692792553.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "This is difficult to pull meaning out of because you’re moving the goal posts.

In 1973 we changed the order from Gold to Oil, floated the dollar. People woke up the next day fearing a market collapse, but instead the \"printer went brrrr\", to quote the kids. The market went up a shit ton but a lot of middle and lower class people eventually lost their businesses because they didn't understand inflation at the time. They just didn't raise the prices at their bakery or diner and eventually got sucked under. Which is why the 1980s sucked. Interest rates were at like 20% going into the 80s.\n\nIn 2000, tons of people lost their jobs and communities were going bankrupt and then 9/11 happened. But around like 2001-02 the Fed also started to figure out that if you could print money all the time and everyone just paid off old debt with new debt AND everyone is in on it and doesn't do anything dumb we can achieve infinite market growth and innovation. That was new.  \n\n\nIn 2008, we did something dumb and committed a ton of fraud and also allowed uneducated people to make terrible choices as an official policy of the financial system. And in response to that the order of things changed again. The Fed and other central banks doubled down on the idea that you never really have to pay back your loans...ever. (that works when you're loaning yourself money and you also print money though - apparently) And they figured out that if you just keep lenders liquid, there will never be a real problem. They started to believe that liquidity was the problem... Not their business practices.  \n\n\nNow we are here.

And you sold a very short dated call, which is going to really be impacted by Vega? So you're blaming your broker because they are trying to make money on commission?   \n\n\nIs it possible that the problem is that you made a bad trade, and then compounded it by selling the other side \\*WAY\\* too late, and in the hole?  \n\n\nAlso -- I don't understand the animosity towards brokers -- especially one like Tastytrade.  First with Thinkorswim, and now with Tasty -- Sosnoff and his buddies have dramatically changed retail options trading for the better.  The costs have come WAY down.  The trading platforms have gotten a ton better.  Should the trading be free? it's almost free now.  I used to pay $10.95 per leg per side, on a crappy web based platform and had to pay for data.  Pay a ton per month for 'screeners.' And pay extra to get Futures quotes.  And, And, And.  Now i pay $1 per contract, capped at $10 per leg, and don't pay anything to close? On a platform that has whatever I need.  What more do you want? I don't pay anything for stock trades. Awful.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
