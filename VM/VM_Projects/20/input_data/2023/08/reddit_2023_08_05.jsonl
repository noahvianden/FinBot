{"title": "Warren Buffett Investments", "selftext": "Am I mistaken in stating that when Warren Buffett makes an investment in a company, the subsequent increase in its value may not solely be a result of any specific actions taken by the company itself? Instead, the surge in stock price might primarily stem from the influence of other investors who follow Warren Buffett's lead. His reputation as a successful and esteemed investor often prompts others to emulate his choices, leading to increased demand for the stock, which, in turn, drives its price higher. In this scenario, the company's fundamental performance might not be the primary driving factor behind the stock's rise, but rather the confidence and trust other investors place in Warren Buffett's investment decisions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nas an example COF and of course Apple.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThoughts?", "id": "15j745i", "created_utc": 1691270502.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "buffet trades can give a bump to the stock price, whether the stock can maintain the price is another story. usually the price corrects itself after a while. \n\na buffet investment isnt necessarily a sign that the stock will surge. \n\ni saw this happen when he invested in $TSM in november 2022, then i think he reduced his position after a few months. but $TSM was a great trade regardless of buffet, and its still climbing\n\nbuffet choices just kind of confirms if a company has good fundamentals since hes a much better trader than the average retail investor", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "I also use buffets interest to at least know a company has good financials.
