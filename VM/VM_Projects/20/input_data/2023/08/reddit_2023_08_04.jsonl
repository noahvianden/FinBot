It looks dismal now because AMZN is at $140 today, your AMZN shares are capped at only $130 because of the covered call, & it doesn’t expire until about 2 years.  But don’t allow anyone to tell you it was a bad trade.  If your covered call is assigned, you’ll make $13 in appreciation, & I estimate that you sold the covered call for a $25 premium.  That’s a $38 gain above $117, or 32% over 2 years.  I suggest doing nothing.  If it climbs to $150, $160 or more & then you’re assigned to sell at $130, you’ll still have a 32% return.  If it drops to $129, your return will be just under 32%.  If it drops to $100, you’ll still have the $25 premium in your back pocket, & still have an $8 return.  If you buy the covered call back today (close it out to cancel your $130 obligation), you’ll pay $37.  Of that $37, $10 is intrinsic value, but $27 is time value.
