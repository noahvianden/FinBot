{"title": "Insider Trading Weekly Update #025: $NOW, $CFLT Executives Bail, Largest Trades Overall + By Market Sector From The Past Week", "selftext": "GM,\n\nApologies for the afternoon post (traveling this week). The plan is to continue with the usual 9:15am EST release and eventually transition to a newsletter when Form Fore is officially live.\n\n**TL;DR** \\- Transactions more than doubled, the majority of which were sales. Purchases did rise slightly from last week ($78.4M / +36%), though sales increased 83% to north of $2B with 722 total insiders selling shares, up 135% from the prior week.\n\nBelow are some notable sales from insiders:\n\n* Ernest Santi, the Chairman & CEO at Illinois Tool Works ($ITW / Machinery) decreased his position by 52.46% with a $58M sale on Feb 3rd\n* Richard Norwitt, the President & CEO of Amphenol Corp ($APH / Electronic Equipment), sold 40.19% of his position in a $53M sale on Feb 3rd\n* William Mcdermott, the Chairman & CEO of Servicenow ($NOW / Software), **sold 97% of his position** with a $24.7M sale on Feb 1st\n* Michelangelo Volpi, a Director at Confluent, Inc ($CFLT / Software) **sold his entire position** with a $17.3M sale on Feb 2nd\n\nAnd some notable buys from insiders:\n\n* Gregory Hayes, a Director at Phillips 66 ($PSX / Oil, Gas & Consumable fuels) increased his stake by 253% with a $1M purchase on Feb 2nd\n* Steven Miron, a Director at Charter Communications ($CHTR / Media), increased his stake by 37.46% with a $960K purchase on Jan 31st\n* John Sanfilippo, a 10% Owner of Sanfilippo John B & Son Inc ($JBSS / Food Products), increased his position by 10.58% with a $349K purchase on Feb 2nd\n\n# High-Level Stats:\n\n* Purchases increased from $57.7M to $78.4M (+36%)\n* Sales increased from -$1.14B to -$2.08B (+83%)\n* Transactions increased from 437 to 930 (+113%)\n* Companies represented in Form 4s increased from 236 to 451 (+91%)\n   * Net buyers decreased from 34 to 29 (-15%)\n   * Net sellers increased from 202 to 422 (+109%)\n* Insiders filing Form 4s increased from 355 to 782 (+120%)\n   * Net buyers increased from 48 to 60 (+25%)\n   * Net sellers increased from 307 to 722 (+135%)\n\n# Transaction Selection\n\n1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **January 30th - February 3rd.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of ‚ÄúP‚Äù or ‚ÄúS‚Äù. This narrows the scope to trades where insiders are putting their money on the line.\n2. **Both indirect and direct** transactions are included in the reports.\n3. Weekly comparisons are to transactions from **January 23rd - January 27th.**\n4. **No companies without a ticker** (e.g. opportunity/income/mutual funds).\n5. No penny stocks or banned tickers.\n\n# Further Context\n\n1. Form 4 data is impacted by a concept known as **backfill** which is par for the course with transactional data. The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\\*roughly\\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.\n2. To combat backfill, filings through this Tuesday are included **\\*if\\*** the transaction date is from the prior week. Otherwise, transactions from this week are excluded.\n3.
