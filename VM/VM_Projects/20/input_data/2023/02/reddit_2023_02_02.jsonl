Tesla ended up slightly underperforming my bear cases, although a caveat here is that Tesla had 60K cars in transit at the end of 2022 and missed out on ~75K units due to COVID shutdowns in China. Without these one-time occurrences, they would've ended the year on ~1,450,000 units.\n\nThat said, accounting for force majeure is supposed to be part of the bear case, so I need to be more conservative here in the future.\n\n**ASP**\n\nFor ASPs, I projected $50,000, $55,000 and $54,000 respectively. Actuals came in at **$54,385**, so I was pretty much spot-on.\n\n**Revenue**\n\n||Part 1|Part 2|Part 3|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**Bear**|$70B|$77B|$73|\n|**Bull**|$85B|$105B|$81B|\n\nActuals: **$71B**\n\nBecause unit sales fell short, but ASPs were correct, revenue also fell slightly short. That said, it wasn't off by a lot.\n\n**Operating Margin**\n\n||Part 1|Part 2|Part 3|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**Bear**|14%|19%|17%|\n|**Bull**|14%|22%|19%|\n\nActuals: **17%**\n\nHere I underestimated Tesla's margins a bit in Part 1, but overestimated it after the huge beat in Q1 2022. Ultimately it was pretty close to the averages over time.\n\n**Net Income**\n\n||Part 1|Part 2|Part 3|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**Bear**|$9.8B|$14.6B|$12.4B|\n|**Bull**|$11.9B|$22.1B|$15.4B|\n\nActuals: **$12.6B**\n\nFinally the Net Income. Here I made a bit of a mistake. Because I did not expect Tesla to make (much) profits from their non-automotive businesses, I only looked at automotive revenues and applied the Operating Margin to that number; however, throughout 2022 both Tesla's Energy and Services divisions became profitable, so the actual numbers from automotive would be slightly lower. Either way, I believe the difference is small enough that we can ignore it for now.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTesla had a very difficult year in 2022 with factory shutdowns in China, high commodity prices and a looming recession. As such, I would've expected them to be close to my bear case, which is exactly what happened. Although I overestimated unit sales and became a bit too optimistic after the massive Q1 beat, all the other numbers were fairly accurate.\n\nRegardless, I will try to be slightly more conservative with my bear case numbers in the future to leave a larger margin for error, as you could argue that 2022 could've been even worse for Tesla under certain circumstances.\n\n------------\n\n**The Future**\n\nLooking at the future, although it is still difficult to predict without knowing the plans that Tesla is expected to reveal at the investor day in March, I will include 2025 in my projections.\n\n**Sales**\n\n||Bear Case|Bull Case|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|**2023**|1,800,000|2,400,000|\n|**2024**|2,400,000|3,400,000|\n|**2025**|3,000,000|4,800,000|\n\n**ASP**\n\nTesla dropped prices significantly in Q1. As such, I expect them to decrease ASPs from $54,385 to ~$51K in 2023. After 2023 I find them difficult to predict, so I will stick with $51K (essentially offsetting inflation).\n\n**Revenue**\n\nBased on the ASPs and delivery numbers, the revenues would be:\n\n||Bear Case|Bull Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2023**|$92B|$122B|\n|**2024**|$122B|$173B|\n|**2025**|$153B|$245B|\n\nAdditionally, I expect the following revenue from non-automotive divisions:\n\n||Bear Case|Bull Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2023**|$16B|$24B|\n|**2024**|$22B|$40B|\n|**2025**|$30B|$60B|\n\n**Operating Margin**\n\nDespite the price cuts, I expect IRA battery credits (starting in March), cheaper commodity prices, continuing manufacturing innovations, increasing economies of scale (especially in Berlin and Texas) and higher margins from Semis, Cybertrucks and Energy to largely offset the hit on margins.\n\n||Bear Case|Bull Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2023**|14%|19%|\n|**2024**|15%|22%|\n|**2025**|16%|25%|\n\n**Net Income**\n\nMultiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:\n\n||Bear Case|Bull Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2023**|$15.1B|$28.8B|\n|**2024**|$21.6B|$47.9B|\n|**2025**|$29.3B|$76.3B|\n\n**P/E**\n\nDividing the current $600B market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:\n\n||Bear Case|Bull Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2023**|40|21|\n|**2024**|28|13|\n|**2025**|20|8|\n\n**PEG**\n\nThis would translate into the following PEG ratings:\n\n||Bear Case|Bull Case|\n:--|:--|:--|\n|**2023**|1.90|0.16|\n|**2024**|0.65|0.20|\n|**2025**|0.56|0.14|\n\n------------------------------\n\n**The conclusion**\n\nNo matter which metric you look at, it's clear that at $108 Tesla was heavily oversold. At its current price, there is an argument to be made that Tesla is fairly valued or even slightly overvalued if you look max 1 year out, in the bear case scenario. This would require Tesla to miss their self-proclaimed sandbagged guidance and for margins to come down for the full year.\n\nIf you're willing to look out more than 1 year, or you believe the bull case (or somewhere in between my bear and bull case, which is my expectation) to be right, Tesla is still clearly undervalued. It would need to grow between 79% and 1,300% through Q1 2026 to revert to the average PEG rating for high growth large caps.", "id": "10s118r", "created_utc": 1675372340.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 24, "comments": [{"body": "I'd say to make your bear case slightly lower.

To me bull case is too high at 2.4M/$29B net income but your bull case can be whatever you want it to be.\n\nThen bear case bad recession margins can potentially go down even more if Elon really means selling cars at such a low price/margin to continue volume growth.\n\nI do think the price cuts and margin scares are overdone since IRA credits should even out a good portion of it.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, that's a good point.\n\nPersonally I do think 1.8M is already heavily sandbagged.

So that would be 1.6M.\n\nBut that would mean that all of that would have to happen this year, which I think is extremely unlikely. So I think I will change it to 1.7M as the bear case.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Great job. \nAs you know, don’t calmly post facts and numbers on r/stocks and expect a rational discussion.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Haha nah, I mainly write these for myself, and if 1 or 2 people over there are actually rational enough to see this and go \"wait, Tesla's numbers are that good?\" or I get any reasonable critique, that's just a bonus. :P", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I often see you talking facts and people just downvote you or get very emotional. \nThere are a lot of smart people and not sub.

{"title": "Why I'm short Netflix", "selftext": "After the last Netflix earnings and the resulting spike in share price, I bought a LEAP put at a strike price of $300. There are several reasons I think Netflix will have a very rough year, and I will include some of the main reasons below.\n\n•I am a firm believer that the key to success is to focus on quality first and profit second. With Netflix's actions they will take against password sharing in March, I think that Netflix will become wildly unpopular. Their method of preventing password sharing will also likely lead to many frustrating situations that will leave customers feeling it's not worth the struggle.\n\n•I think many families or friends will use alternative streaming services that allow password sharing even if they find Netflix superior, as it can be convenient to spread the cost of watch the same selection of shows and movies and discuss them.\n\n•I think that the streaming services market is becoming oversaturated, and that Netflix will loose it's edge as people become more willing to try out many similar services.\n\n•I think Apple will find ways to promote their streaming service on their devices and make it harder for Netflix to reach it's audience.\n\n•I think the recession will be worse than many expect and that Netflix will be cut out of the budget of many consumers.\n\n•I don't think the federal funds rate is properly factored into many tech stocks that have relied on nearly free borrowing such as Netflix.\n\n•Growth companies rely on infinite growth, and if that growth is over the company already has a foot in the grave. Netflix is clearly reaching it's limit so all they have left to do is try to milk more out of their current subscribers which as I said earlier will cause discontent and a lower quality product.", "id": "10rj55a", "created_utc": 1675319941.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 22, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n\nHey /u/Centistry, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: I think Netflix is going to have a really tough year and their stock price will drop significantly.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "https://preview.redd.it/5d32v5ctirfa1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a3a88720ac54f5e5d80e1a9b7ddb7ad0edd59366", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Im short on Netflix too, it is pumping out content for middle-class millennial white girls when they are taking a break from murder podcasts; while also wanting to crack down on them using their parents account.\n\nTheir whining is going to be the final straw and push daddy to cancel the account he hasn’t actually used in years.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Netflix better hope that daddy doesn't use it, because with their method being based off of a singular wifi, it'll cause families with kids off at college to either pay more, or cut off their college age kid from the account.

Where I see that being problematic in the ad supported teir is that a great show is like a rollercoaster for the emotions. It captivates you and before you know it you're up all night watching a show and excited to see what happens next. I feel that ads are like pausing a rollercoaster. It stops the momentum, it gives time for the viewer to remember that maybe they should get some sleep, finish their schoolwork, or go and do something productive. Netflix in many ways is designed to be this great roller coaster: they play into it by making sure the next episode will play automatically, and their originals are often designed to make sure that you always think to yourself \"just one more episode\".", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> I feel that ads are like pausing a rollercoas\n\nMan, am I really that old that there's a whole generation of people who don't remember this is exactly how TV was! (even movies!)\n\nThat's why we have those, \"3-part acts\" formula for all sitcoms/TV shows, even sometimes in the post-ad, online streaming era.\n\nThe thing is, you can still do the binge watch, but within an episode, there could be 3 acts, and 2 advertisement slots between any two acts. Writers are trained for decades to fit each act and start the other in just the right way to allow the viewer to take a break, while also be hooked to come back for more.\n\nSo it's not one unbreakable, intense engagement, but a gradual build up and maybe even a small cliffhanger between two acts. If the concern is that the advertisement model will break that engagement, then I would say this 3-part act approach actually makes engagement *better* - the human brain gets exhausted if it is kept in one state for way too long. Hell, your brain would not read this whole comment, if I had made it into a giant wall of text - paragraphs are *literally* the literal equivalent of your mind taking a small break.\n\nEven 90 minutes movies can be too much for people, and sometimes theatres have a break at 40-45 minute mark. I remember when movies used to be 2-3 hours long and theatres offered 2 breaks in between. Perhaps that is what made TikTok/Youtube shorts so addictive, it is the *other* extreme of engaging the human brain, to the point of exacerbating ADHD/ADD issues.\n\nWith that rollercoaster analogy, imagine being on a rollercoaster for *hours*, or hell, even 30-40 minutes.

My rollercoaster analogy is certainly flawed, because like you said there is nothing pleasant about being on a rollercoaster for more than a half an hour or so. \n\nDespite the valid points about shrinking attention span, the existence and popularity of binge-watching is undeniable, and I would be lying if I said I've never stayed up all night watching Netflix.\nI find the design of Netflix and how it appeals to binge watching to be what makes it stand out, and what made it great. You bring up a lot of good points about how it certainly has an opportunity to pivot, but oftentimes pivoting is a very turbulent process and few make it out of the other side. Furthermore, I find it hard to see a great vision about a new niche that Netflix will be able to dominate, and the end of many great companies comes when they decide to play it safe and make themselves like their competition instead of focusing on what made them emerge as a leader in market share.\n\nI am excited to see what the next year brings, and even if my philosophy on what makes tech companies successful ends up proving to be flawed, my put will be the price of my education.

{"title": "Option Buyers in AMZN - This is for you (some of it)", "selftext": "Hello All,\n\nI have coded a tool in Pine Script (the coding language of Trading View) which gives the probability of a move in % for any asset.\n\n**Why is knowing the probability important?**  \nBecause trading options becomes a process driven exercise and not an exercise based on gut feeling alone. However, knowing the probability doesn't mean it will guarantee the outcome (a Win or Loss). It does guarantee that over time, your wins and losses will be closer to the probabilities that you trade. For example, if a move has a probability of 95%, it doesn't guarantee that it will happen, because there's still a 5% chance that it won't. But, if over time you trade **ONLY** 95% probability events, your wins will be closer to 95%!\n\n**How does knowing the probability help with trading options?**  \nSo the options market prices the options based on probabilities. There's a theory that the sum of the premiums of the call and put options for the **AT THE MONEY (ATM) strike**, divided by the strike price, gives a fairly decent estimate of the expected move in the underlying. **For example, the strike price of an asset is 500, and the 500 call option has a premium of 10 and the 500 put option has a premium of 10, the total premium is 20. This total premium is then divided by the strike price of 500 to give a percentage of 4%. That is the move the options market expects in the asset on either side**. Note, there are multiple sources which say that the total premium to be used ranges from 75 - 95% to estimate the expected percentage move in the asset. I prefer to use 100% of the total premium, as it gives some cushioning. So once we figure out the expected move by the options market, we can use that to figure out the probability of the move happening based on my tool.\n\n# For the Option Buyers in AMZN\n\nAs AMZN results are expected post market hours today, the options market expects a move of about 7.6% for the options expiring on the 3rd of Feb. And as per my tool on Trading View, **the probability of AMZN moving more than 7.5% by the 3rd of Feb. is only 18% (See Image Below).** That means, there's high probability (82%) that you will lose money if the market does not move by at least 7.5% by the 3rd of Feb.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4sgxxnj36sfa1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=02bd3d5f50ea8ec28a9008ca815bef8cddac604a\n\n**However, as I said earlier, this only gives the probability of the move happening, it does not guarantee that a move will happen or not. A very good example - META! The options market were expecting a 9.15% move for the options expiring on the 3rd of Feb. The probability of META moving that much was ONLY 4%! But, it still did move waaaaay beyond 9.15%! (See Image Below).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b76clwr46sfa1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=29119dd3f22d42a7d8392f19ac87641da3f69ea1\n\n**So then how does knowing the probability actually help? What gives?**  \nWell, like I said earlier, knowing the probabilities will help over time and bring your wins and losses closer to the probabilities you trade. **For example, when probabilities of events happening are low, the options for those assets can be written using credit spreads or naked (depending on one's risk appetite). The premium from these credit trades can be used to to buy options or debit spreads (depending on one's preference) in assets whose probabilities are much higher.**\n\n**Note - the trades here will always be short straddles (sell the CE and PE at ATM strike, in equal quantities), when selling, and long strangles (buy the CE and PE at strikes that are 1 - 2 strikes away from ATM, in equal quantities), when buying.**\n\n**The options market priced NFLX to move about 1.55% for the options expiring on the 3rd of Feb. That is a 95% probability event! (See Image Below).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/11erxb366sfa1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=1efe191854c00a9dfe1729efe14478b144cbfe4f\n\nSo a prudent trade would have been to short META ATM CE and PE options and long NFLX CE and PE options 1 - 2 strikes away from the ATM. (A short straddle on META ATM Strike and a Long Strangle on NFLX, 1 - 2 strikes away from ATM). And yes, the META trade would/will give a massive loss, but it would be a 3X or 4X of the premiums credited. However, if NFLX does move over 1.6% (either side) before the expiry on the 3rd of Feb., the NFLX debit trade could yield a 2X or 3X.\n\nThe above was an example of how this tool can effectively be used to trade both the sides. But if someone just wants to buy options, then it makes sense to just trade the high probability trades.\n\n**ENDING NOTE**\n\nThe tool that I have coded is still being tested and hence I have not published it on Trading View as yet. It is a private script. However, Redditors can ask me to look up **ANY assets along with the expiry date of the options** and I can give them the probability and will also keep a track of how does it play out. It will help in actually testing out the tool in live markets.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!\n\nThanks :D", "id": "10rqcin", "created_utc": 1675346026.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "I’m confused.
