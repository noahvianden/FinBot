Dumped Zoom and Twitter. -- Barrons.com\nMentioned:\tCVNA GM LYFT MARA MSTR PTON SI TSLA ZM\nBy Adam Clark Tesla and Peloton were on George Soros's shopping list in the fourth quarter of last year, as he also took new positions in Carvana, General Motors, and crypto names, while dumping Zoom and Twitter Soros Fund Management, the family office of billionaire George Soros, bought 242,399 shares of Tesla (ticker: TSLA), according to a filing on Monday, bringing the fund's holdings to 332,046 Tesla shares. The fund acquired more than 83 million shares in Peloton Interactive (PTON), bringing its holdings in the fitness-bike maker to more than 105 million shares. The quarterly investment filings of large investors such as Soros are often watched for investment trends, although the data are released with a delay and might not show the current positions of the fund. The Tesla and Peloton moves were joined by further purchases of beaten-down technology companies, with the Soros fund taking new stakes in used-car seller Carvana (CVNA) and ride-hailing company Lyft (LYFT). Elsewhere in the automotive market, the Soros fund acquired 500,000 shares of General Motors (GM). Soros Fund Management owns put options on Silvergate, call and put options on MicroStrategy, and a Marathon Digital note. Soros Fund sold its position in Twitter as Elon Musk prepared to take over the social-media platform late last year, while also dumping its stake in video-calling company Zoom Video Communications (ZM) during the quarter. Write to Adam Clark at adam.clark@barrons.com Corrections & Amplifications This article was corrected at 5:00 p.m. ET to show that Soros Fund Management owns put options on Silvergate, call and put options on MicroStrategy, and a Marathon Digital note.
