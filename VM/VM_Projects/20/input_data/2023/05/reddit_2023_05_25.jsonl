{"title": "IBM: Not Your Grandma's Boyfriend’s Favorite Tech Giant Anymore, Pioneering the AI Revolution Like a Boss", "selftext": "**Picture  IBM. Yeah, I'm talking about that old-as-dirt tech behemoth your  grandma's boyfriend probably worships. The same one that brought us  colossal mainframe computers in the 60s, somehow didn't see the PC  revolution coming in the 80s, and took a while to hop onto the cloud in  the 2000s. Yep, that IBM. Well, buckle up, because the dinosaur's got a  new trick, and it's called AI & no-one is paying attention.**\n\n**If  you haven’t been paying attention, IBM’s been making changes over the  past few years.  Its fairly new CEO (Arvin something) has jettisoned the  shitty parts of IBM and was integral to bringing RED HAT into the fold.   In addition to that, IBM has partnered with “disrupters” like  Palantir, uIpath and more to offer those disruptive technologies in its  products through the army of consultants on the dole.  Our Boy Arvin was  preaching real AI (not the old Watson BS) before it was cool.  He  stated on his day 1, it would be IBM’s MAIN FOCUS!**\n\n**So,  AI is about to make IBM's product suite hotter than the action at  Wendy’s on a Friday night. We're talking automatic deployment and  configuration, making the very popular, but currently too damn difficult  to implement Red Hat OpenShift as accessible and easy to deploy as your  boyfriend’s weiner into your wife. Lowering the barrier for AI  adoption? Check. Simplifying complex processes? Double check. Boosting  customer loyalty and demand like a young version of the great Tina  Turner (RIP)? You bet.**\n\n**And  it's not just the products. IBM's about to make it rain with consulting  services too. Imagine a world where AI is integrated everywhere. Sounds  cool, right? But also, like, really freaking complicated. That's where  IBM swaggers in, flexing its consulting muscle, ready to save the day.  While your cousin’s boyfriend (you) might consider IBM a tech dinosaur,  big enterprises see it differently. To them, IBM is the reliable  old-timer that knows a thing or two about pioneering in AI.**\n\n**In  the wild world of AI, where enterprises are about to outspend consumers  like a WSB member after a big 0 DTE play, IBM is positioned  to rake in some serious tendies. IBM versus Accenture in AI consulting?  It's like choosing between a moon landing and a backyard rocket  experiment.**\n\n**But  it doesn't stop there. IBM is also on the cusp of injecting AI steroids  into its operational processes. Think AI-driven automation, predictive  insights, and enhanced security protocols. Basically, it's like IBM is  about to put its operations on an Elon hyperloop towards  efficiency and cost savings.**\n\n**So,  the next time you're thinking about IBM, remember this: It's not just  your grandma's boyfriend’s tech company anymore. This sleeping giant is  waking up to the sound of AI's alarm clock, and it's ready to seize the  day. As the AI revolution rolls on, IBM is sitting pretty, ready to  become the biggest beneficiary in the enterprise space, while  simultaneously shaping our digital future. So, keep an eye on this  old-timer, because IBM is poised to do what it does best: surprise us  all.**", "id": "13rkmfv", "created_utc": 1685028179.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|187|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: IBM is about to take over the AI space with its new products and services.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "You said AI less than 20 times in your DD.

Then, came the artificial  intelligence frenzy that sent the stock and its big tech peers on a  tear.\n\nThe chipmaker has added around $560 billion in market  capitalization since Wood dumped her shares — with the last $200 billion  of that surge coming overnight after the company handily beat earnings.\n\nAlthough  Wood holds Nvidia across several of her smaller funds, investors in the  flagship ARK Innovation ETF (ticker ARKK) have mostly been left out of  this year’s blistering 161.58% rally.\n\n**In February, when Nvidia traded for $234 a share, roughly 50 times forward earnings, Wood said the valuation was “very high.”**\n\n“We  like Nvidia, we think it’s going to be a good stock. It’s priced —it’s  the ‘check-the-box’ AI company,” Wood told CNBC on Feb 27. “For a  flagship fund, where we’ve consolidated towards our highest conviction  names, part of that has to do with valuation.”\n\nA spokesperson for ARK Investment Management said the company doesn’t comment on trading activity. \n\nWood has been a long-time fan of Nvidia, but her conviction on the stock has wavered at times.\n\n[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cathie-wood-s-arkk-dumped-nvidia-stock-before-560-billion-surge-1.1925004](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/cathie-wood-s-arkk-dumped-nvidia-stock-before-560-billion-surge-1.1925004)", "id": "13rv7ov", "created_utc": 1685053089.0, "score": 169, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 25, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|1863|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Cathie Wood sold ARKK's stake in Nvidia at the top of the run in early January, before it surged another ~$200B.
