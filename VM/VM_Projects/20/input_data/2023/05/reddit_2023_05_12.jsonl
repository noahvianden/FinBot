Starting from May 29, 2023, they will recall some imported Model S, Model X, Model 3, and domestically produced Model 3 and Model Y cars manufactured between January 12, 2019, and April 24, 2023, totaling 1,104,622 units.\n\nThe vehicles covered by this recall do not allow drivers to choose energy recovery braking strategies. At the same time, they may not provide sufficient warnings for situations where drivers have been deeply stepping on the accelerator for a long time. These factors combined may increase the probability of long-term misoperation of the accelerator pedal, potentially increasing the risk of collision and posing safety hazards.\n\nThis recall is conducted under the initiation of a defect investigation by the State Administration for Market Regulation. Affected by the investigation, Tesla (Beijing) Co., Ltd., and Tesla (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. plan to use over-the-air (OTA) technology to push newly developed functions to vehicles within the recall range to reduce the risk of collision caused by excessive speed due to long-term deep stepping on the accelerator pedal. The functions include: (1) Providing an option on vehicles without the ability to select the intensity of energy recovery braking, allowing drivers to choose the intensity of energy recovery braking; (2) Adjusting the default state of the vehicle's energy recovery braking strategy at the factory; (3) Issuing a warning when the driver deeply steps on the accelerator pedal for a long time.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
