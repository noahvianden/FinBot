There's all these ways of measuring performance that accurately tracks the ROI in the digital marketing world. Where I used to work at, we had very sophisticated models that calcs LTV/CAC = ROI. We project the LTV of a customer acquisition out 5 years to reflect whether the $ spent acquiring said customer is worth it.\n\nThere's also the concept of marginal returns on spend in paid ads. This means, the first few million spent will net you amazing returns, but after spending $100 mil, you will face diminishing returns on additional ad spend.\n\nI spent a number of years running FB ads, Google adword campaigns, and various publishers around the world. The company I worked at is one of the largest ad buyers in the fortune 500. I've spent millions in ads in a single week, so I know a bit about this industry.

Why? Well this was fueled by a fed speaker…\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vrmnb871q93b1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=00ae62df0f9b811a46c55530dc61a322facc2599\n\nAs you can see no surprising here a fed speaker says one just remotely bullish thing and the markets of course run like crazy with it… So the interesting thing is that over the last 2 weeks markets quietly while rallying have been supporting the odds of a 25bps hike in June and no rate cuts by end of year… \n\nAs of this morning we had a 71% chance of a rate hike in June… now its down to 29.8% chance…\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/te4icmm1q93b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b8e581a66c6601cb8fab6f7db0bc0ee60865faa\n\n**DEBT CEILING VOTE**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ev9kjn42q93b1.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc0d2e71248f6b98c21062021688e43987e52c4f\n\nTonight at 830pm is supposedly the vote for the debt ceiling… Now my understanding is that only a simple majority is needed… and as of right now only 30 people say they will vote against it… so my maths says it will pass… we finally get to see if this is a buy the rumor sell the news event or not…\n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o4uqkoj2q93b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=53e23cb54a4ef1e8152e047011041d013506ec51\n\nOfficially we have established 422.04 as a new supply… in doing so we have taken our 419.5 and 418.78 supplies… \n\nNow if this plays out much like the last few retraces we should expect one more day of selling to form a bullish reversal candle. If that plays out then 414.55 is our target and where we would likely bounce. If we loss 414.55 then our next support is 410.2. \n\nHowever, if we rally off this debt news tonight 417.28 could be the new demand and then we would start to target a move back to 422.04. \n\nAs of right now the daily DMI and other indicators I follow support a move lower tomorrow and that this sell off has at least one more day to go. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9pbqg463q93b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dcb6c1408654e9bc074396892ec195639c5dff7\n\nThe daily has a classic textbook carrot top here… we are in a pretty impressive blue bear channel that once that resistance breaks which sits at 416.2 for tomorrow I would expect the upside recovery… We also bounced off and held the daily 8ema at 416.84 today. IF we can close under the daily 8ema then I would start to target the daily 20ema which is going to be sitting right near 414.73.\n\nWith the black 4 day long bull channel officially losing support it is time to expect a pullback much like we saw from May 19th to 24th and May 1st to 4th. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 422.04 -> 429.68  \n Demand- 414.55 -> 41.2  \n Support- 417.3 -> 415.3 -> 414 -> 412.5  \n Resistance- 418.4 -> 420.2\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/59o4i624q93b1.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=34dd6a91ba9788483b5bc3447812a0f53cf61ba9\n\nIdentical setup here on futures daily with a new supply being put in at 4240 taking out previous supplies at 4208 and 4216. With a daily DMI wave down supporting further downside along with a few other technicals our target here should be 4156 demand and 4127 on a bigger sell off. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqfspsr4q93b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=11e2466714443f2c3f7237717fdd87a161f6a8cf\n\nAs I was suspecting we did repeat the topping pattern that we have seen on SPY/ ES at least 4 times now… we came down today and broke support of the black bull channel and now have established a new blue bear channel. That resistance sits at 4195 for overnight tonight and support is all the way down at 4150.\n\nThe biggest thing to note here is that we still held the daily 8ema support at 4185. If we lose and most importantly close under that 8ema our next major target is the daily 20ema at 4167 area. We have interestingly also bounced off the daily 50ema quite a few times on sell offs (3 times of the last drops to be specific) which means we actually have downside as low as 4135-4140.\n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4240  \n Demand- 4157 -> 4127  \n Support- 4188 -> 4157 -> 4127  \n Resistance- 4213 -> 4240\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\nVery similar movement on QQQ here and actually played out nearly perfectly to the 347.11 level I was looking for after rejecting yesterday. With that rejection yesterday we formed a new supply at 352.8. In doing that we have now taken out 347.11 supply… there is a lower supply at 337.6 with a demand right below it at 336.37 that I am targeting actually. \n\nIf we do see a continuation to the downside which the daily DMI also supports then as long as that DMI is waving down and QQQ is dropping fully will be looking for this 336-337 area which likely will be extreme support and cause a massive bounce. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zrc6nnm5q93b1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=272b807a013c4b594b49ed85ccb55164c08b0ada\n\nQQQ Daily Levels  \n Supply- 337.6 -> 352.8 -> 357.09  \n Demand- 336.37 -> 331.35\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lalgnec6q93b1.png?width=737&format=png&auto=webp&s=98addc526bb7a7128c33c9c1f614abd5532ce3a5\n\nTons of movement today on the VIX… so initially it looked like the doji reversal bounce off 16.92 was going to play out perfectly and leave us with a bloody SPY day and big green VIX day… however, with that intraday recovery the VIX actually took a really large sell off before finally bouncing once again EOD.\n\nThe VIX officially broke through that white bear channel (this would be similar to the bull channels SPY/QQQ/ ES have been in)… in doing this with the breaking of bulls on spy/qqq/es then I do forsee further downside on the markets… I would look for with a this candle body breaking over 17.97 and a closure back over the 8/20ema I would be looking for a breakout tomorrow to the 18.86 area on the VIX. \n\nHowever, if the markets receive the debt ceiling vote well… then if 17.97 continues as resistance our next support and target is 16.92… \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kne8xpu6q93b1.png?width=475&format=png&auto=webp&s=96b7b27b183c9365c1c08c06d7b48e90be95bfde\n\nHonestly todays another one of those days where I actually finished pretty solid green but honestly with those losses midday during the v bottom recovery it just didn’t feel like a win mentally…\n\nThat v bottom recovery (Really it was a massive cup and handle) was incredibly frustrating as I would say 75-85% of the way up it was overbought and actually a majority of the way down it showed perfect put entries on a 1min and 5min timeframe… as you can see I bit the bullet numerous times on that. What was really odd is that unlike usual (At least for me) the call entries actually presented themselves as fake breakdowns and bear traps…\n\nWhat I mean by this is that generally I wait for confirmation before I enter on both 1/ 5min price action but also on indicators… I would see all the confirmation to take a put (nearly perfect) and it would then start to sell off like it was the correct play however, it would almost immediately bounce to stop you out. The other hard part was almost every single new 15min candle would get rejected so aggressively and hard that you would expect markets finally found a top… however, that was the dip buying opportunity in disguise. \n\nOverall been a great week so far but today was definitely frustrating.", "id": "13wx40t", "created_utc": 1685565018.0, "score": 52, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 21, "comments": [{"body": "It really does feel like this market will never make a significant down move again.
