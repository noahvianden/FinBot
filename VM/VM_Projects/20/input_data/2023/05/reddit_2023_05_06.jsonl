{"title": "The Basics of Options: Part One of However Many of These I Decide to Make", "selftext": "Okay. There are no emojis in this post. Leave now if you want emojis. There will, however, be useful market ideas, which are the emojis of intelligence. \n\n.\n\nI used to frequent this place a few years ago, and it appears some of the basics have been lost. And though I am not currently drunk enough to handle the questions this post will generate, I plan to rectify that before I take any questions. So buckle in, and here is an explanation of what options are, how they work, and some very, very basic information about \"the greeks\" that govern them.\n\n.\n\nOkay, so you're young, dumb, and full of Wendy's at the employee discount, and you want 100 shares of Google. Well, you can't have 100 shares of Google, because those are for customers of Wendy's that can afford the Dave's triple. But you can pretend you own 100 shares of Google, for a little while. You can basically rent them.\n\n.\n\nAn Option is an agreement that by a certain time (the option expiry date), you will either sell them 100 shares at a given price (this is called a put), or buy 100 shares at a given price (this is called a call). You don't have to fulfill the agreement, but they have to honor it if you exercise the option, then, or at any time before then. You paid for the option, so it's yours to exercise, sell, or let expire.\n\n.\n\nOptions have value if you are certain the price will go up or down, because you are extremely savvy at market dynamics, or more realistically because your dog shit in the back corner of your yard and you believe that makes the market go up, you can have much larger leverage to profit from the price change. If the price of a stock goes up $1, you gain $1. But if you have an option on that stock, the gain is $100 ($1 each on the 100 in the option). If you buy an option one dollar \"out of the money\" (above the current price), the price will have to go up $2 for you to gain that $1, but the option will be cheaper, because the price will have to go up a dollar before your options is even \"in the money\" (the price of the stock is above your purchase strike price). People sell it to you cheaper, because they are less at risk of you exercising the option.\n\n.\n\nSo it's Monday, and your dog shit in the corner, and you think Google will go up. You buy a call option expiring Friday a dollar out of the money. The prices goes up $3 by Friday. The raw value of the option is $2 over your strike price, so $200 in your pocket, if options were just based on the strike. Naturally, there's more to it than that.\n\n.\n\nUnfortunately, people know you are going to watch your dog's rectal prognostication, so they don't just charge you a flat fee for these options.\n\n.\n\nOptions are prices on a number of factors. Those are called the Greeks, not only because they are represented by Greek letters, but also because they will probably lead to austerity measures in your lifestyle after you spend all your money on options. The first big greek you will learn to hate is Theta. You get charged for the **time** you have for the price to go up. \n\n.\n\nTheta is costly further out, but people want to be paid for having their 100 shares tied up while you feed your dog Alpo. Theta decays over time, slowly at first and then quickly on the last day (the \"zero day's to expiry\" day... 0dte). On the last day, you burn about half a dollar of theta from open till noon on a strike close to the price. So fifty dollars gone while you wait for the price to move. You get used to it, but it sucks.\n\n.\n\nThere is one more greek I want to talk about right now, because it will become more important later: Delta. Delta can be thought of as the percent of the 100 shares that can be thought of as in the money. If your Delta is .45, it's like 45 of your 100 shares are in profit. at 4 pm on Friday, that's what your value is if it's a fraction, because that's the value of your option over the strike. If your option is under the strike at close of business, the delta is **Zero**. And you have nothing, but the dog shit in your yard to clean up.\n\n.\n\nOkay, that's Part One.", "id": "13a0kz5", "created_utc": 1683403598.0, "score": 62, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 20, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|242|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Options are agreements to buy or sell shares at a certain price by a certain time.
