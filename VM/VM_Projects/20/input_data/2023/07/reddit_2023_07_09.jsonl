The reason being is that the only money to be made here is from your short put's greater extrinsic value, so your profit is capped just like a debit spread, you are also suffering from theta(because you are long a shorter dated put), just like a debit spread... and must have the underlying stock move by a sufficient amount just like a debit spread.\n\n>received a credit of $680\n\nYou only get that if your greater dated, short put, decrees in value in some way before your long, lesser dated, put expires. Either by moving up by a significant amount so that your cheaper long put's loss, is less than your more expressive, short put's loss of value. Or move by moving down so that both puts have a large intrinsic value and roughly the same low extrinsic value that you were short on.\n\nToo be fair you do have the advantage of having profit potential from both a move up or down unlike a regular two leg put debit, but so does a long condor or long strangle so meh.\n\nBut there are some disadvantages. One is liquidity risk, if you do a reverse calendar spread on say Tesla you'll probably be fine, but if the underlying is illiquid you might be forced to buy your short put back at a greater price than what you sold it for. Yes this is unlikely but it could happen like if you were short a LEAPS with a large bid/ask or a put of some obscure stock. In this case your loss can be greater than your long premium minus short premium theta decay, regular horizontal or diagonal spreads don't have this problem.\n\nAlso with a diagonal debit spread you can make intrinsic profit between the two strikes but you can't here.

Google is commissioning new state-of-the-art optical ASICs from Samsung and they will continue TPU ASIC development. In principle, I think that researchers will find a way to first execute and then train large language models with ASICs using a lot less energy, now that we know the components of the right LLM mousetrap. I'm not an expert as to why ASICs currently excel for some neural networks, but not others. If any expert can weigh in, feel free. As far as I can tell, existing ASICs excel in neural network applications when lots of nodes are directly connected to many adjacent nodes, like in a CNN, and perform more poorly when many more longer-distance quasi-global connections are involved. But, one solution to this problem is to make larger and larger ASICs/TPUs with more and more complex 3D-layered connections. Typically, the costs of ASICs are related to enormous up-front development and printing costs. But, Wall Street has tipped its hand, and is currently willing to pour huge sums of money into the picks and shovel producers in the AI field. Wall Street is also plunging money into into PLTR and AI, which are digging massive earnings holes. But, with a 10-year horizon, you aren't guaranteed to profit from money-losing AI companies, so it is very speculative to invest in these companies. \n\nIn a market with a temporarily ravenous investment appetite, revenue growth is a better fundamental metric than earnings growth, so long as limited earnings growth is a result of investment in new technologies in a manner that doesn't incur high-interest debt. If you have a very long-term horizon, recessions are a time not to look at your portfolio and hold companies that still have earnings and a moat. \n\nAs far as my understanding goes, once you have an LLM that can speak a language, you can unleash it in parallel to read every article, block of code, and research paper in a specific sub-field, and you can do that with a better ASIC/TPU. I think these are reasons why TPUs and ASICs will continue to find new GPU-crushing applications, as they did with bitcoin mining, when that was a thing that shouldn't have been a thing as it needlessly contributed to climate change.\n\nAs a disclaimer, I am a long-term buy-and-hold investor in NVDA. I have ridden it through earlier peaks and valleys and will continue to do so, but won't add right now. Entry points for formerly high-flying stocks like NVDA and AMD are served by actual recessions. I think that both MSFT and GOOGL can be good simultaneous hedged investments, where MSFT's gain does not always mean GOOGL's loss. Right now, MSFT is making ASIC-related investments in AMD, which is too rich for my blood, while GOOGL's recent moves seem to be oriented towards Samsung optical ASICs, when Samsung only convenient to own through a 20-25% max weighting through an index fund, like EWY.\n\nFinally, both MSFT and GOOGL have reasonable PE ratios considering their enormous forward-looking investments that aren't reflected in earnings metrics. Most importantly, the search engines own the data that is needed to train AI, so GOOGL, MSFT, and BIDU (if you are willing to give the CCP money under the table) will find new life beyond search because people gave them decades of data for free only for exposure and ranking.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "What you need to consider is that a company that was a startup has a great position to dethrone google search.
