I know we have all heard this repeatedly again and again for the past few days, but the evidence is beginning to compound and it is beginning harder and harder for bulls to deny the fact that we have a long bear market ahead of us.\n\nThe first of the indicators is the following: The yield curve has inverted. I'm not going to go into an in-depth explanation on what the yield curve is, but you just need to know it has predicted every single recession in human history except there was a time in 2021 when it inverted but did not cause a recession.\n\nThe second indicator is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is on a huge bull run and is becoming a very attractive place for average retail investors to put their money for 10x or higher gains during turbulent times.
