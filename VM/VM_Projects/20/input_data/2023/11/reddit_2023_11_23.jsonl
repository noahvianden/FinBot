{"title": "Intel my fav lil bich", "selftext": "Good morning its Doobie Times my regards, be soft on me its my first DD here.\n\n I have been watching Intel stock since 2021 and am actively following any news I find for it. Some reasons why I think it is quite possible for Intel to reach the $50 price target are the following:\n\nFirstly, and let me be clear here, Intel has not yet unlocked the potential to go on a rally (even though they have rallied over 20% in the past month). They currently have 13 active fab locations and are planning to add 8 in the coming 2 years. Combine this with their intention to get into the foundries business, and you can understand what the potential for Intel is.\n\nCurrent fabs:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bee9zgpho22c1.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=36fb64c671a7988237f06fa805bf38d07b1e2fba\n\n When looking at Intel's financials, they are down $2.4 billion or 15% from Q2 2022 due to lower demand. In my opinion, the balance sheet provided doesn't really boost investors' confidence. I think most investors are seeing Intel as a long-term play, 1-4 years, in which, when their cash flow becomes positive and their future investments (factory sites, deals for their foundry business) materialize, they would definitely become a player in the AI game. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/veg8r3gbp22c1.png?width=1332&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b57551e53653a063a88db4900450dc863e9b216\n\n Now, when the future promised looks so good, why is Intel not going further up? Reasons for this are two possibilities. Firstly, the German government has a €60 billion problem with their household, and included in the €60 billion, which they now don't have, was the promised €10 billion subsidy to Intel. Currently, the government in Germany is not keen on keeping the subsidy, so this is something to closely watch. Furthermore, with two planned production sites in Israel, the conflict there, if it were to spread out, could also threaten Intel's plans. My opinion is that we currently may be at the top until we get more positive news, but we won't see $50 until earnings if they are good. The price target right now is between $44.50 and $40.93, so I think we will just theta there a while. \n\n \n\nI will be looking for opportunities to buy more leaps in case we drop below $40, as in my personal opinion, Intel can become an easy 10x bagger play if Germany and Israel play out fine, and they continue their positive outlook.\n\n[ps: where the arrow is drawn marks the day where intel got an analyst upgrade to 50$.

If they dont deliver high manufactoring volumes in time, they are screwed.   \nThe roadmaps look like they are on schedule for now, but Intel doesnt have the best track record of delivering in time in the recent past.  \n\n\nAnd they actively tried to cover up their mistakes by \"paper-launching\" products so that they can technically claim success even though high volume mass manufactoring was still years away.

Another reason is that they already did +63% YTD so for me it's a signal that I missed the proper timing to get in. Yes mid to long term it can reach 50+ I do believe that , but it needs to drop below 40 to make me consider buying. Another reason is that I already have some stocks from this sector and I dont want to end up overinvested in one single sector in my portfolio.\n\nHowever there is another scenario that's in my mind lately. If they want to get into foundries,  could it be that they buy a smaller company to get their way in (e.g. us-based skywater? they do 200mm/90nm or someone else? or a bigger like GFS?)
