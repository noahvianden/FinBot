No one enters a trade to hope losing money after all :)\n\nAssuming a probability of x above, the trader will realize a number of trades hoping the majority will result in a PROFIT.\n\nBUT whether we have a single trade or many, all of them can be quantified by a single meta-trade consolidating an entry price, a duration and an exit price.\n\nBasically if we call t1... tn a series of trades... then all of them can be summarized by a single triple of (entry price, exit price) which averages all of them.(t1,...,tn) = (entry, duration, exit)\n\nGet it? Regardless of anything everything a trader or algo trader does can ultimately be summarized by the entry price, a duration and exit price.\n\nIn fact all of Warren Buffets' career can be summarized by those 3 variable. Of course the average of the entry price is consolidated over decades as is duration and exit price and the capital involved massive.\n\nBut per the reduction above, and mathematically, the critical value becomes exit price which is after a duration in the future. Hence predicting it accurately is the only way to ever trade successfully.\n\nAny trading system will need to predict that future value.

Their goal is to maximize returns captured from company profits directly and so, there's no need to exit because exiting ends participation in portfolio company profits. \n\n- Prediction is necessarily an uncertain business and if we allow our total return to be controlled by our predictions, we are taking on the risk of this uncertainty fully. However, the entry price is certain at the time of investment. So the best way to to manage the risks inherent to our predictions is to pay the smallest price at entry, which increases our maximum profit estimate and the expected value of the trade.
