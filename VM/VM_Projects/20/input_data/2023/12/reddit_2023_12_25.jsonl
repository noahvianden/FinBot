{"title": "AMD June 2025 call or Intel January 2026 call?", "selftext": "Obviously no one knows, but what would you guys bet your money on if you had to choose one of these two bets, and why? Just looking for opinions\n\nAmd: Strike Around 240, expiring June 2025\nIntel: Strike Around 55, expiring January 2026\n\nI feel with Intel they have a lot of potential because they are starting to compete a little bit better with their new meteorlake chips, and by getting into the AI space. Intel is also a lot more cheaper and I can get a decent price for a further contract. This would give me some more time to hope for them to come up with something good. AMD is a lot more expensive for a contract expiring sooner. This doesn't give me much time and I don't know if they really are cooking up anything different from what they're already doing. AMD is a lot more reliable though.", "id": "18qtwqm", "created_utc": 1703546877.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "So you're comparing a bet where you're hoping AMD doubles in 18 months vs INTC increasing by 15% in 24 months?

The only thing is, intel in the money doesn't really make that much vs amd in the money would make a ton. I guess hoping for it to double is a bit much though.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "A lot of this is based on the assumption that what happened last year will continue as the stock prices gets more and more overextended.\n\nAMD and Intel skyrocketed in 2023, but you also have to consider that they dumped more than 50% in 2022. Expecting to the 2 companies to continue going up at this rate and double again for 2024 is pure greed and hopium. At this rate, they are priced beyond perfection.\n\nThere are better valued plays for AI and tech going forward, itâ€™s probably better to short AMD and Intel (especially AMD) as hedge for other tech calls.", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Hahah man, you sound like a total options nooob. \n\nWho the fuck buys such out of money options? Itâ€™s no better than burning your money. Hilariously bad trade; AMD especially.\n\nIf you want to a reasonable trade : buy something in the money or at the money.. never out of the money.

I am very bullish on both and feel that AMD could outperform INTC in 2024, but also think we may get a 5-10% tech correction in January.  That being said, time is a critical component when it comes to a bullish call option position, so I personally may look to buy more Jan 2026 Intel calls over June 2025 AMD calls, especially given the high extrinsic (time) portion of the option premium on AMD calls compared to Intel", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I might lean towards intel more. I'm waiting for intel to pull back to atleast 40-45 first though. AMD is great but I feel like the chances of them going a lot higher is slimmer now cause they have been on a decent bulk run for a while now. I guess the same can be said about intel but intel seems to have a couple more interesting changes coming up in the near future.

AMD kinda overtook intel years ago and intel doesn't seem to show any real effort on trying to perform against them. Maybe it's management issues but intel has kinda disappointed people the past couple years. I haven't heard much about this TSMC thing before this.
