{"title": "FOMO index meltup into January 2024 with parallels to 2017/2018.", "selftext": "2024 is approaching and we're kicking things off with a bang! SPY and QQQ on fire, QQQ 420 not a meme anymore, maybe even your favorite shit stock meme's showing you some green. \n\nVIX (the fear index, for all you newbies) is currently plummeting to historic lows. January 2024 is setting up to be like a never-ending party, complete with confetti, champagne, and of course some lucky WSB winners with a suspicious amount of gain porn lately. \n\nSo, a rally kicking off in the last quarter, ATHs, low VIX, green every day and WSB trying to short a steam roller - when did I see that before? Yeah, that sounds exactly like in 2017/2018. It went like this: Oct17: market up. Nov17: market up. Dec17: market up. Jan18 market only vertical up. Feb18: everything blew up:\n\n[January 2018 meltup](https://preview.redd.it/plc3sjxm547c1.png?width=471&format=png&auto=webp&s=17fb9cfc43f0e394d0c514be2df7667a691e328e)\n\n2018 also gave us the volacalypse, with several short VIX funds being collateral damage (they went puff in one day, see r/tradeXIV). Something to watch out for if you go allin long with leverage, after all you don't want to be that idiot being up 10000% on your calls only for the market to do another one of these volacalypses and take it away in one day:\n\n[VIX 2017 \\/ 2018](https://preview.redd.it/3d2iun52647c1.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=06f059e98818f8e5f3658e4079213b604b444a71)\n\nMaybe this might repeat, maybe it might not. But with non stop green and VIX this low, its like a double whammy for index calls. They are cheap because there is no volatility and markets just melt up in one direction, because again there's no volatility! Contrary to popular believe on WSB, calm waters are the best times to go long. Managing calls in calm waters is also just so much easier than trying to time crashes with puts. January 2024 could be that magic money printing machine. If you play you cards right you don't need to trade the rest of year and you'd just sail into the sunset with your new found wealth.\n\nBut you do you, WSB. Time to make some insane gains and lose them shortly after instead!", "id": "18ljhxh", "created_utc": 1702933400.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|7651|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: - SPY and QQQ on fire, QQQ 420 not a meme anymore, maybe even your favorite shit stock meme's showing you some green.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Um… I feel like VIX has been bottoming out lately and is showing some upswing.
