So it's no surprise that many made good return this year.\n\nIn the past month or so I've seen many posting awesome returns utilizing the wheel strategy. This got me a little concerned. I'm happy that our r/thetagang fellows made money, but worry that this year might set an over-optimistic expectations. Simply put, in a bearish year, we will not see such good returns using the wheel strategy. If executed poorly, many will lose money.\n\nTrading is a lot more than just using some strategies then you'll succeed. Risk management, sizing, and also one's ability to function under pressure all play important roles here. Especially with the psychological side of things, many people say that they sell put on stocks they don't mind owning. This is technically correct but may be difficult to execute when your account bleeds badly. \n\nRegardless of the market conditions and whatever your strategies might be, I hope you stay mentally clear & strong, know the reasons that you make certain trades, and stick to your plans. \n\nHappy New Year and hope you have a prosperous 2024!", "id": "18uxjzj", "created_utc": 1703991452.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "Tides rise, fish feast\n\nTides fall, fish get caught in the rocks \n\nTale as old as time", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Well said.
