Your not buying the LEAP to profit off of. Your buying it to cover to allow you to sell more calls. Storm was not fully bearish, if he was he would have bought puts or opened call spreads. I feel that people who arent option writers really shouldn't comment, you have no idea what your talking about. The theta on the short call exceeds that of the long call (ITM calls), thus he is taking a SHORT position in the short term, and worst case sideways in the long term. If he had done this, he could sell enough calls to pay for the LEAP halfway through the year and then be be free to sell calls to his hearts content.\n\nI have been writing options for the last 2 years now and i have experienced some options hitting 300%+ against me, yet I am always covered so i didnt give a shit. \n\nIn fact this mistake is only 1 of several when writing options. How many here actually know about pin risk? I bet your probably not thinking about that either.\n\n The mistake was he choose not to cover himself in the most economically efficent way : ie LEAPS. Nobody here would suggest covering via stock since it requires so much upfront capital.\n\nIf you need help understanding the strategy im suggesting your free to look it up here:\n\n [https://www.wyattresearch.com/article/poor-mans-covered-call-create-income/](https://www.wyattresearch.com/article/poor-mans-covered-call-create-income/) \n\nThis was what storm was attempting to do.

(e.g. buy 6/20 400c, sell 2/21 500c, etc) then ill understand what you're trying to say.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "Sure, there are special nuances when entering into a Leap.\n\nFirst you do a deep ITM leap. This keeps your \"covered\" side mostly protected. Even if the stock tanks 10%\n\nSecond, you need to time an entry on the Leap. Different people use different TA/FA indicators to decide it. I personally use the Spy indicator. If spy drops but say TSLA is fine, but the macro event drags it down with it, this is a good way to enter.\n\nIf you look at the 510 strike jan 2021 Leap. The premium is about 134. This means if you want to write short calls 10 contracts at a time, you'll need to buy 10 leap contracts for about 134000. This sounds like alot, however storm himself does have this capital.\n\nNext if you look at the strikes for 570 for jan 31, 2020 you get about 33 per contract. What does this mean? It means that if you write this contract, you've already gotten yourself 24% of the capital back in 1 month. Your ROI is looking around 4-5 months.\n\nNow it should be pretty fucking obvious why you will recover your initial cost. Now you can ask, what if the stock tanks? My question to you is, pull up any stock over the course of 1 year and tell me what the odds of 20% drop are. That is your break even point because you were selling calls for that whole year.\n\nI'm not saying its free money, but god damn the EV is pretty fucking positive if the following is true for TSLA.\n\n1. TSLA continues to work its way towards the 1 mil / year cars\n2. People keep buying these cars\n3. TSLA infrastructure play starts working\n\nIn addition, since your covered, you can be increasingly ballsy on the strike prices for big premiums because you don't care. Not caring gives you high grade autism diamond hands because if storm had executed this strategy starting last year, he would be a fucking rich man right now. Anytime your short call gets tested, just roll it up and out. No thinking, no sweating, no margin call no fucking nothing.\n\nHopes this helps my fellow autists out.
