The company is worth a lot more if you can comprehend what they talked about on battery day, but most people are simply in denial. GM announced they are in partnership with LG Chem to build a factory to produce pouch cells with 30 gWh capacity by 2023. Tesla has offered a pretty clear roadmap that should have them to 100 gWh by that time. GM's cells made with LG Chem will maybe cost under $100 per kWh, yet the 4680 cells, will cost Tesla $50-$75 (eventually will go down closer to $50) per kWh. The 4680 cells can also be scaled up to mass production easier and cheaper. The 4680 cells will run cooler than pouch cells. The 4680 cells will form the mid structure of the car, whereas the pouch cells GM will be using will not. The weight savings, the performance benefits, the cost savings, and the manufacturing efficiencies Tesla will benefit from as compared to GM are huge. Also, that Tesla will be casting the front and back as single pieces puts them way ahead of anyone else (you need to design the part, you need the casting machines, and you need an aluminum alloy that Tesla invented to be able to do this... unless you have been working on this in secret, there is no way you start now and have this ready for mass production in a year or two).\n\nIf people have not figured it out already that Tesla is way ahead (without discussing FSD or their grid/home energy storage projects), they will not figure it out until at least a year from now (maybe even 2 or 3) when the benefits of what Tesla is doing start becoming apparent in actual production and profits.\n\nSo rather then seeing the price shoot up to $800-$1,000 a share now and then doubling over the next 3-5 years, I would not be surprised to see the stock stay flat ($300 - $600 range) for 2 years and then suddenly shoot up to $2,000.

This compares to a 31% gap in the most recent June quarter.\n\nWe expect that large gap to continue for the foreseeable future.  Traditional auto is largely lacking a compelling, price effective EV offering.\n\nThe traditional auto dilemma. Option 1; release a car with features and range at parity with Tesla and sell the car at cost. This car will be priced 10-25% higher than a comparable Tesla, thereby softening demand and leading to further market share loss.\n\nOption 2; subsidizes vehicles to gain market share from Tesla. This will increase losses with limited margin cushion. The more they sell, the more money they lose.\n\nTaking it to the logical end, we believe car companies that have been around for 50+ years will eventually (10 years from now) be forced to restructure or go out of business.\n\nTesla's growth is coming from lower priced Model 3&Y with deliveries up 56%, compared to S&X down 13%.

The market valuation is based on future cash flows, discounted for current value (or it should be). To achieve 5T in 2030 that would mean the future cash flows should equal about 5T in current value, averaged out let's say that means 10T in bottom line numbers in 2040. \n\nI'm sure we can justify 10T 20 years from now accounting for inflation, an energy market share boom, car revenue, robotaxis, etc, etc. But what we're not adding on here is that since we are looking so far out you need to add significant risk just extrinsic, not even including intrinsic risk of capabilities. \n\nRealistically taking risk into consideration the 2030 profit would have to be closer to 20-30T. \n\nNo one is saying it's not possible but this is an investors forum.

Intel processors have a design goal of a FIT under 200 at 55¬∞C. So that would be 570 years of running at 55¬∞C before a processor fails. \n\nComparing that FIT rates of fatalities by [type of transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aviation_safety#Transport_comparisons), \n\nBus, 11.1 FIT\n\nRail, 30 FIT\n\nCar, 130 FIT\n\nFoot, 220 FIT\n\nAir 30.8 FIT\n\nCycling, 550 FIT\n\nParagliding, 8850 FIT\n\nSpace Shuttle, 70000 FIT\n\nOk, so what does this mean for actual number of deaths from FSD? There's around 700,000 Tesla vehicles with HW2/3 that should be capable of autonomy.

I don't think Tesla was found at flaw in any of these because the driver could be blamed for not paying attention. \n\nSince the car isn't autonomous yet if you bring it down to like 2 hours of daily use on average, and estimate a FIT rate then you get like 2 FIT to match 1 fatality per year today. Even if you stick with that rate and extrapolate it up to full +60 million cars on the road driving 8 hours per day autonomously it ends up being 350 deaths per year from FSD. \n\nReally if deaths happen every day that would probably be easier to just normalize than a random news article popping up every month about how a autonomous Tesla ran over some child crossing the street. It's probably going to be a nightmare to navigate the PR, that's why Tesla is doing it carefully. \n\nBeing 3x safer than air travel, 13x safer than cars is also a ridiculously high bar to meet.

This would show all at once on the books in the form of a 1-2 billion in net income addition based on the following: \"The general principle in IAS 12 is that a deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be utilised.\"\n\nIts also interesting that they earned the deferred tax asset when the tax rate was higher (30%?) Before the Trump tax cuts.  If those tax cuts stay, it would mean an even longer period before they need to pay income tax.\n\nSo let's break it down into an easy example:\n\nCompany A started business in 2017, and, focusing on growth, showed losses totaling $1,000 from 2017-2019. If the tax rate during those years was 30%, they would have a deferred tax asset of $300. In 2020 the tax rate was lowered to 24%, and Company A started to turn a profit and showed $1,250 in net income. They would pay 0 income tax and use all of the deferred tax asset (1250x.24=300).\n\nThis would result in a ridiculously high net income, but wouldn't really mean much.

(Maybe sooner.) This triggers around $80b of forced buy & holding of TSLA.\n- The 2021 March convertible notes will further improve Tesla's debt position and deleverage Tesla's balance sheet. Tesla will probably communicate their preferred method of conversion sometime in November/December. These will also generate quite a bit of additional cash flow in Q1.

As I said, robotaxis seem to be far away at the moment even Tesla expect them to be around right now in a high amount. \n\nLevel 2 means, the driver has to be aware all the time and has to check what the car is doing. In the end, it is worth nearly nothing. \n\nThe real shit is level 3. Level 3 allows the driver to watch videos, movies, write E-Mails, surf in the net etc.) while driving because the driver has 10 seconds to take control over the car when the car is getting in trouble. As I said, it seems level 3 is way harder to reach as everyone expected. So there will be some time until we see the first level 3 car. \n\nAnd that gives the competition time to catch up. I posted it in another thread - Mercedes announced level 3 for the second half of 2021. And Mercedes is not the only big player, there are companies with big IT and AI knowledge like google and apple, companies who know how to build cars since decades like BMW and Mercedes or long etablished car companies with a lot of ressouces like GM or VW. All of these companies research and develop FSD cars.\n\nJust imagine if Tesla is not the first who releases a real full level 3 car. The stocks will take a huge hit.\nTesla is not the hunter anymore. Tesla has become the hunted! And as the hunted, you have to deliver. And Tesla failed to deliver right know (but it is not end of the year right now, there still is some time). That's why I said, they need to get their shit together and either stop announcing things like robotaxis, or deliver it in time. With each announcement the stocks will raise. With each time missing a milestone, the trust of the shareholders will decrease and the market follows. Thats just a normal process. Teslas market value is so high because a lot of people belive Tesla has something that will make their cars sell way better than any other brand. If Tesla can't deliver these things way before the competition (and that should not only be a few months), there is nothing what justfies the current market value.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Sure, but Mercedes announcing Level 3 means fuckall.
