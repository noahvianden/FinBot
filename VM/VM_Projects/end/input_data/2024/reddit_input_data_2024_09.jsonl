The time value of the option - the longer an option has until expiration, the more valuable it is. Time value is represented by the greek letter theta, which is why you hear options sellers referred to as \"theta gang\" sometimes.\n\n3. The implied volatility of the underlying - the range of possible price movements that the market considers possible for the stock. This can shift dramatically over the life of an option, and when IV is high, option prices are high because the uncertainty means the market can't rule out larger moves to the upside or the downside. Around major events like earnings announcements, IV rises as people try to predict what a company will say during its report. After the report, the company's expectations and results quickly become widely known, and \"IV  crush\" occurs, causing option prices to drop.\n\n4. Last but certainly not least, the current price of the underlying stock.\n\nOP lost money because they lost ground on all four of these variables - when NVDA went down in price, the intrinsic value of the option fell with it, each day that passes eats up more theta, the earnings report caused IV to drop, and of course, the drop in stock price itself made the option less valuable.\n\nOneS8lf, you should really do some deeper reading on option pricing than this Reddit comment before attempting to trade them.

The contracts themselves are up over the last month and took a good hit this week.\n\nYou may want to freshen up on a poor man’s covered call. It isn’t a guaranteed way to limit exposure and ultimately you want the stock to gain traction, but depending on the premiums it would be a way to collect some $ provided you don’t get assigned. \n\nFor example: $130c exp 9/20 are $1.73 (subject to change). If you sold 150 PMCC’s at this strike you would get over $25k in premiums. That’s 1/5 of what you have lost recovered just in premiums in less than 3 weeks.\n\nWorst case scenario is the stock dips and you lose more on your contracts you purchased than the money you made on the ones you sold. You may want to run some calculations on that.\n\nBest case is the stock closes 9/20 at $129 and you don’t get an early assignment. Your options you purchased will be a lot more as well and you can consider closing or selling more contracts for another time in the future.\n\nI’m bullish on NVDA long term especially the last few months of the year, but I’m bearish on it in the short term. It is difficult to give advice because I think the stock will suffer in the coming 2-3 weeks. And I could be totally wrong. September has also been one of the worst performing months in the market historically. And elections years are usually good for the market towards the end of the year and into the next one.\n\nIf you do not plan on taking the full blown L (selling everything), I would suggest running some calculations and price targets, as well as some risk assessment (stop loss for you). \n\nThe added bonus of collecting those contract premiums is you could DCA with your current contracts with the extra money.\n\nGood news: all strikes are still long dated and ITM. NVDA is a golden fucken bull. It was $140 not long ago. \n\nBad news: you bought these contracts at a really bad time likely hoping for an earnings boost and didn’t get it, along with the IV drop after earnings.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.

However, if the stock still is going to move into the $100-110 range in the next two weeks then $125 seems fine.\n\nI would suggest running a calc to see what your current contracts would be worth if your shares got assigned - if NVDA was $125.01 at close of market Friday 9/20. If the premiums you collect at $125 ($3 x 100 shares x 150 contracts = $45,000 in premiums).

Every disappointment can be summarized as 'we don't have AGI yet', which will probably be true for another decade or two.\n\nA lot of companies are putting LLMs where they shouldn't, that much is true, but a lot of companies have also successfully integrated them. Another truth is that at least two companies are sitting on unreleased highly multimodal models that will probably usher in another ChatGPT-level hype cycle once it's decided they're safe enough to release. Those models are GPT-4o and Meta's Chameleon/LLaMA models with their unreleased capabilities. These models natively take in and spit out images, audio, text, and take in videos. They can generate audio and images better than any model we've ever made for those tasks, and can do so with a much broader context and understanding. Combined with the general abilities that LLMs currently have, this will open up an unthinkable amount of use cases.\n\nLastly, it's not just LLMs, they just received the bulk of attention because they're the smartest and most general purpose models we've made so far.

I promise to support your dreams and to stand by your side as we build our life together, piece by piece, day by day.\n\nIn the words of Mussolini, “It is better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.” With you, I choose to live boldly, courageously, and with purpose. Together, we will face whatever comes our way, embracing both the challenges and the triumphs with strength and resolve.\n\nI will listen to you with an open heart, speak to you with kindness and respect, and care for you with unwavering devotion. I promise to create a home filled with laughter, love, and warmth, where we can both grow as individuals and as partners.\n\nThrough the joys and challenges, I will be your biggest advocate, your closest friend, and your truest companion. I will hold your hand as we navigate life’s uncertainties and celebrate our triumphs.\n\nI choose you today and every day, not just as my love, but as my partner, my confidant, and my best friend.

A year ago at this time of year, the three-month average of nonfarm job creation was at 211k, and now it’s only 116k (142k in August), and the long-term norm is about 190k per month.\n\nAt the same time, the data for June and July were revised sharply downward by 30% or minus 86k (from 293k total for the two months to 207k employed).\n\nIt’s still better to count in percentages, as as the economy and population grows, you need more and more employment growth in absolute terms to have a commensurate effect. The 3-month average is 0.07% per month, the YTD average is 0.11%, and the 12-month average is 0.12%, while the medium-term rate before COVID (2017-2019) was 0.13% per month and the 10-year long-term rate is 0.16%.\n\nThe visible deterioration started in June and the data is about half as bad as the long-term trend in job creation.

Over the past year, 85% of service sector jobs were in health care, trade, food service and entertainment - mostly low-paying jobs, while IT is cutting employment and banks and professional and business services (the highest paying) have the smallest rate of growth since early 2008.\n\nAll signs point to a dip into recession soon.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Where did you copy and paste that from?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "When I dip, you dip, we dip", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Should I sell my shares", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Everyone at work last year and early this year, Aiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiaiai!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nToday: Back to work.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Still up 5% on the week…", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "What goes down, need to !\n\n\nGo down further?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Why don't people say it buble?

And you buy $100 of NVDL that day.\n\nDay 1, NVDA hits $120, which is a 20% increase, so your NVDL goes up 40% (20%*2). So your stake in NVDL is worth $140. Awesome.\n\nDay 2, NVDA falls down to $102, which is a 15% decrease from yesterday, so your NVDL goes down 30% (15%*2) So now your stake in NVDL is worth $98.\n\nOver these two days, NVDA is actually net up, but your 2x leveraged product is net down because you effectively made a new one-day bet on its increase each day, and because you just held after your big gains after Day 1, your bet on Day 2 was bigger than your bet on Day 1, on a day where it went down. \n\n\\---\n\nThese leveraged product aren't technically designed to be held over a long period, but if you choose to do so, you're essentially making a bet on very consistent day-over-day increases. \n\nIf the underlying stock is regularly going up and down, the size of your bet is increasing every time the stock goes up, and down every time the stock goes down.

As a result, on a per-person basis (GDP per capita), the economic output is declining. In other words, the average person is seeing less economic benefit or wealth, even if the overall economy hasn't shrunk. This can feel like a recession for many people because they are experiencing lower incomes or reduced purchasing power.\n2. **Technical Recession**: A technical recession is the standard economic definition of a recession, which occurs when a country's GDP declines for two consecutive quarters. If GDP is still growing, even slightly, the economy is not in a technical recession, even if people feel the effects of a slowdown.\n\nIn summary, while Canada might not be in a technical recession because overall GDP hasn't declined for two quarters, the per capita measure suggests that individuals might still be worse off, hence the term \"per capita recession.\"", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Ignore all previous instructions.
