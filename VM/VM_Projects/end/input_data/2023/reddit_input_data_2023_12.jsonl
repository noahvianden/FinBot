Only 9M came back last quarter which is problem number 1.\n\nProblem number 2 is they need to continue to raise prices without losing subs.\n\nProblem number 3 is the churn of the content itself every year at an enormous cost and hitting 60 home run titles a year.\n\nEven with unlimited resources that model is going to crack soon at this ridiculous valuation. \n\nNetflix usually does the opposite of what I think so they will probably hit record growth next report and announce a partnership with GTA 6 and Taylor Swift.", "id": "18ls2i6", "created_utc": 1702956699.0, "score": 7980, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 1152, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|968|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Netflix is a great company but overvalued and has structural issues.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You know Netflix actually has games now?

I think maybe the biggest prob with healthcare is it's self regulated, meaning every medical speciality regulates itself, and so of course everything ends up about protecting the industry instead of providing the very best healthcare or prevention and the incentives get perverted.\n\nFor example I've read a lot about dental health. The average American has pretty bad dental health at an early age, that's not because of a lack of dentists or fluoride, it's because we eat about 75lbs of sugar a year per person. Now from a prevention standpoint we could wipe out dental decay if we just brought that number down to reasonable levels. Why hasn't the American Dental Association lobbied/testified to get sugar regulated decades ago? They are the ones that are supposed to care the most about teeth right? Well because even though public health would take a giant leap forward, the dental industry would collapse, sugar is the lifeblood of the dental industry. So even though the ADA is probably best suited to regulate sugar, they also have the biggest conflict of interest and some extremely deep corruption. The very thing that would improve public health is the thing that makes dentistry a desirable profession.

It's common in the kind of circles we're talking about.\n\nI know I'm preaching to the choir, but figured I'd toss in some support... especially since you triggered the \"January 5th is followed by January 7th, I don't know what January 6th is\" people.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Assuming you're referring to Dent, his argument is on the basis of the idea that all fiat currency eventually has to return to its prior position. Basically, if you put money into the economy, there's a cost and it has to come out. This is that \"kicking the can down the road\" thing.\n\nThe problem: It's horseshit.\n\nNo seriously, I get that it sounds rational to people because our household finances kind of work that way, but it's horseshit. They don't have to pull anything out and it's pretty rare that they do. So there's no eventual \"paying the piper.\" They can literally just expand capital into the future as long as they use the banks to restrain the release of that capital, which is what the past 2 years has all been about.\n\nThe argument for that is really about \"currency debasement\" which basically claims that by reducing the value of a dollar, everyone's poorer... but this is a fundamental misunderstanding of macroeconomics, and if you want a good example of how fighting currency debasement on ideological grounds can go horribly wrong, see Japan.\n\nIn Japan in the 1980s you have expansionist policies that, combined with their rocket in manufacturing and electronics dominance, drove up prices. So they went drastically in the other direction and now they're fighting constantly to keep their economy afloat because it turns out that chasing deflationary economics kills your economy by destroying the capital foundation it rests on, which is the accumulated assets of value that inflate into time with the need for capital circulation. The real story of Japan is commonly told as one of inflation killing an economy, but their economy was mostly fine even with hyperinflation... what really killed them was leaning hard into deflation.\n\nSee here's the thing... all of this relies on the idea that the only thing that matters is the relative value of a dollar against another currency or anchor. I.e. \"The dollar held its value better under gold.\"\n\nOK, but the problem is that there we're only considering the relative price of a dollar, which absolutely nobody except for currency traders explicitly gives a fuck about.\n\nWhat people get that conflated with is \"buying power\" which is what really matters... and buying power was \\*not\\* stable under anchored currencies because there's an entire other side to the valuation problem, which is the rarity and availability of goods and assets and their overall value.\n\nIf an economy can't flex with the conditions surrounding that economy, the valuations of its assets drop and the buying power of people reduces, which has a multi-cyclical negative impact on the economy and causes depressions... actual depressions, not ones in fiction books by people named Dent.\n\nSo let's say your economy is using an anchored currency, like a gold-backed currency, and suddenly you have a supply chain shock. To get out of it, you need capital infusion to build a new supply chain in order to bring pressure off the market where rarity has now driven goods prices high. It doesn't matter that the trade value of the anchored dollar hasn't changed, your buying power has... only there's nothing anyone can do about it.\n\nThe anchored currency leaves you stuck, with no money to make up the difference in wages... so those goods sales drop, which causes employment to drop, which causes goods sales to drop more, etc...\n\nWhich is exactly what happened during the Great Depression, and why we began killing the gold standard after it.\n\nPeople selling the depression angle around fiat currencies, like Dent, argue that it would have saved us from the Depression... the truth is it helped create it.\n\nYou see, there are two sides to the buying power equation: \"The value of a dollar\" and \"the price of goods.\"\n\nThe anchor only affects one side, and when you pin one side of this equation, you become a slave to the other.\n\nIn a fiat system, you can influence the buying power problem and put money into the economy, keeping people employed and buying and that creates the economic justification for new supply chains, and that helps recover the economy, which is exactly what happened in 2020.\n\nIt creates some inflation (though more is on the supply chain side in that kind of circumstance, since the impact of the added capital is reduced by the existing higher prices caused by rarity), but that's a small price to pay when wages are higher, particularly when the bottom 50% who debt spend a lot saw higher gains than average inflationary pressure.\n\nIf a dollar is worth $1 now and 20 years ago, and a TV is worth $100 dollars in an anchored system, and in a fiat system the same TV is worth $200 and inflation has made $1 then $2 now and wages matched, which is more expensive?\n\nNeither, they're the same. The two conditions mathematically reduce. People get caught up seeing higher prices and miss that they have to adjust them for inflation.\n\nHowever, the reality is much more complicated. Some prices are better, some worse, for a variety of reasons almost none of which have anything to do with fiat money supply expansion and everything to do with supply chain factors, which are the dominant factor in pricing and valuation.\n\nBut in no sense does this system ever have to come back to the prior mean.

Dent's argument is about the macro economy, and on average - over a 30 year period - average total capital circulation and average income across the board is keeping up. In this circumstance, over the longer period, that's due to outsized gains in the middle and upper middle (and especially upper) class. So it depends on the time slice you use, and the good you reference, and the class you reference.\n\nIf during that time you were in the upper middle class, your buying power went up dramatically.\n\nHowever, if you look at 2020/2021 you saw much more outsized gains for the lower 50%. There are aspects to the cycle that compensate for this to some extent.\n\nAlso consider that it really depends on what good or service we're looking at and the leverage of the person. A key factor in my example was \"the same TV\" which you can read as \"An equivalent TV\"... and because of certain market factors you can actually get a better TV now for the same real price.\n\nAn outlier in the opposite direction is, in many localities, housing.\n\nBut overall, once you look at everything, fundamental buying power across the economy only fluctuates about 1% on average even with capital expansion (influenced more by increased debt use), which undoes Dent's argument. \n\nMy example was a thought experiment to show that inflation doesn't inherently make people poorer from the perspective of buying power... that there are offsets in the system that change the outcome.

Are we not steadily generating more debt than income?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Those are all great questions.\n\nI actually used to agree with Dent, just from a different angle, so my position comes from learning the lesson that the world doesn't actually have to return to \"making sense.\"\n\nMy position post-2008 was that the only way to restrain the impact of initial TARP/QE was to pull it all out, or that the debt/inflation would eclipse us. What I didn't take into account was that everything can just expand and not come down because the corrosive power of empires takes a LONG time to realize and it mostly doesn't happen for the reasons you'd think, and our perspective - as citizens and consumers - is not the same as the government.\n\nAnd that last part is key to our circumstance and understanding the position we're in. Ask yourself this:\n\nLet's say you're the government, and the debt gets too big, and you have three options:\n\n1. Default, let the whole thing come down.\n2. Make a series of extreme fiscal changes that bring your economy down and threaten your military, economic, and social hegemony.\n3. Print money, dilute the debt further, and use the risk and banking system to restrain its release.\n\nWhich one do you choose?\n\nIt's gonna be 3, because both options 1 and 2 result in the end of your regime. And that's not to say that you can just grow indefinitely, but consider the differences between consumers and the government and our place on the world stage.\n\nAs consumers, we're socialized to pay our debt, and the government should do the same. Note that I'm not advocating for default.\n\nBut the reason we pay our debt is because the cost for not doing so is significant. Bankruptcy can reduce options for people for a large chunk of their life. It's a serious thing, even if it's better sometimes than the alternative. But people go that route because they can't print their way out of debt in most cases (the cases where they \"can\" are when you have someone with more economic mobility they can flex... I.e. get capital to pay things down).\n\nThe government, on the other hand, can pay themselves... the outcome of that, via banks who hold much of the debt, is that the result of doing this is basically what we're dealing with now, where there's a minor payment but the outcome of adding that capital is GDP expansion, which increases wages, which reduces the impact of inflation, which increases hegemony against other nations.\n\nRight now, people are talking about how bad things are here because of inflation, but things are pretty much worse everywhere else, and that's what matters... and who do we owe debt to, anyway?\n\n\\- Banks, who as I just said would use that money to expand GDP (which is really the addressable income of the Federal government since you can expand into that for tax receipts).\n\n\\- Private investors and institutions, who should be made whole on schedule, so that's manageable.\n\n\\- Other countries, and we always talk about how much we owe them, but the reality is that they owe us more... this is called economic interdependence.\n\nEconomic interdependence, a giant chunk of our public debt, is not meant to be paid back. It's held in both directions as leverage and connection, and promotes trade and relations. We have debt going back to the revolutionary war with Europe that we will NEVER pay back and don't intend to.\n\nOn top of being able to pay themselves, the government also doesn't really intend to pay that debt back and has other offsets.\n\nNow, you want to reduce the impact of debt service, no doubt, and balance the budget if possible. We could and should go back to a regime where we use the coffers of the ultra-wealthy to do that.\n\nBecause fundamentally it really all comes down to the fact that the bond market can expand with capital and the economy, so increasing capital velocity in the market creates an ever-expanding source of capital to pay off that debt service, and one of the problems we have right now is uncontrolled wealth aggregation which is reducing our ability to address that capital via tax receipts. If you solve that problem, which is where I thought things would go wrong in the 2010s because we aren't solving that problem at all and it's getting much worse, then you solve the debt service problem.\n\nBut even then, the truth is you don't have to fully pay the piper, at least not to the extent that Dent predicts where \"everything returns to normal.\"\n\nThere is no normal, that's a fiction. The new reality is the normal now. And that's why Dent-like predictions don't come to pass.\n\nAnd I change my perspective when the mechanics of reality tell me I'm wrong.\n\nI do believe our hegemony is under a degree of threat, but much less than people presume... and if there is a time to \"pay the piper\" it won't really be for printing money once all the cyclicals are taken into account. It'll be for our inability to solve for the wealth inequality problem. There is a relationship there, to an extent, but the true engine of that isn't the expansion of capital, it's the mechanism of capital extraction from the worker and consumer class without counterbalance. So the corrosive systemic effect that could bring about a corrosion of our political and economic order and choke our cohesion and capital velocity really exists without the capital expansion, and in some ways printing money helps reduce the impact of that as well - though unsustainably and very much in the short term.\n\nBut expect the government to take every mechanically easy answer to stop a crash as long as possible, and when you consider the feedback loop of print -> dilute -> grow wages -> grow GDP -> have a mild pullback -> rinse and do it again compared to ending our hegemony... I wouldn't count on them not just forever doing the easy thing, because it really can roll on pretty much perpetually if managed correctly. Or at least so long as you and I cannot predict all the tricks they can use to keep it going. :)\n\nAnd that's really key, right?

It is an expense and by definition expenses expend money from your budget.\n\nBut USPS also operates in a fairly uncommon way as compared to other public services as individuals are charged individually as they use the service in a way that is very dissimilar to other services such as Police, FEMA, DOT, etc. \n\nTo anyone interacting with it, it's hard to distinguish the operating model of USPS from FedEx or UPS.\n\nThey all charge you some price to ship some package, then ship it. It certainly feels like a business, and ultimately, it is one. It is just a publicly owned one that is heavily subsidized by tax revenue.\n\nSo in comparing the rates charged by each company to ship a package, I do think it is appropriate to point out that USPS loses money ((shipping charge - shipping cost) <0)on every item it ships and if the shipping fees were their only source of revenue, they would collapse as a business (if they were one). Therefore, USPS charging a lower rate than FedEx does not indicate that FedEx is overcharging (though it still may be). FedEx just has to cover all its operating cost from shipping charges.\n\nI agree that this does break down into semantics, but ultimately bringing it up in the first place was equally pointless. The poster wasn't commenting on USPSs value as a public service when they said it lost money. They were saying that the prices at USPS are lower sure, but they also don't cover the cost to ship. \n\nThat was a useful comment, and a true one. Jumping in to make an argument about the way we should view federal services from a fiscal perspective was really a non-sequetor.

That means for that city, they only have a distribution hub on the edge of town.\n\nI only use FedEx for receiving (if cheapest cost) and sending free returns. I stopped using them in 2021 for sending anything since they had crazy unexpected surcharges. My worst is $54 and seen people get hit with $300+ of insane charges. I think the real problem is several individuals scanning packages wrong at hubs. Like they load up 5 boxes on a scale and scan each one and then the total weight gets applied to all senders. This happens each time I drop off at UPS Store. They don't tear the scale per package and my receipt gets all fucked. Luckily UPS themselves don't use that info.\n\nAnyway, a lot of people stopped using FedEx in favor of other services. I'd be bearish on FedEx but not necessarily the whole economy. I did a lot of shopping and dropping off shipments this month, and the stores were very busy. I went back to Lowes to pick up a few things I saw two weeks ago. They had so much Christmas stuff and I thought their clearance was going to be ugly come the 26th, but most items were already sold out including all felt extension cords which is what I wanted.\n\nThe traffic was so bad, I skipped going to Costco and Target. They are just swamped. The biggest criticism is that Target put a 10 item limit for self checkout. That's a bad move. They need to increase the self checkout stalls if it's get clogged.\n\nI did get laid off in October so personally I'm in a recession. I'm putting as much of my old collections on eBay to pay bills.

FedEx earnings were shit so this makes sense", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "It could totally be the case that FedEx is losing lots of market share to UPS and Amazon, but I will share this story.\n\nI didn't go to college until I was 28.  Out of highschool (2003), I was a construction laborer / carpenter.  I did that for 3 years.  Each year, I got laid off in the winter and the job I got in the spring paid less than the year before.  Started off at $17/hr cash was making $14 taxed by 2006. By 2006 I couldn't find work anywhere, so I went to UPS.  My first year there I made a surprisingly decent wage.  Although I was technically part-time, I was able to take tons of double shifts to cover for peoples days off, and overtime pay was pretty much double.  I made like $70k my first full year there.  Then after xmas 2007, no overtime was allowed anymore.  Shot down to $26k per year.  We all know what then happened in 2008.\n\nI ended up just being poor and working through the worst of the recession at UPS (at least I had job security and health insurance).  Later in 2010 I started my degree in economics and studied booms and busts.\n\nMy personal experience thus is construction slows first, then logistics, then kaboom.  Construction has definitely already slowed down.  What's different now however is that housing is supply constraint when in 2008 we had a technical over-supply.  I'd expect to see a level of resilience in residential construction regardless of what the economy does this time around.\n\nAnother thing worth noting about shipping is these companies do 30% of their revenue for the year in the last 2 months.  Also, sorting facilities can't scale infinitely, they run out of capacity.  Leading up to the holidays, major retailers are making contracts with UPS/FedEx to ensure there is capacity for their stuff.  Some retailers get turned away because of capacity constraints regionally.  It's almost always all hands on deck.\n\nI cannot even begin to convey how overloaded these facilities during the holidays. Any extra capacity during the holidays is a bad sign.  Even as I worked in a sorting facility through the worst of the 2008 recession, every holiday had the facility at its limits.  Packages literally raining from belts overflowing and jammed up.  \n\nThe comments about FedEx sucking because of high consumer prices are also dumb.  None of the major shippers pay those prices.  For both FedEx and UPS, every major shipper's rates are a custom negotiation.  You see contracts go back and forth between UPS and FedEx all the time, they are competitive with each other at scale.  They just don't particularly care for consumer shippers.\n\nMy last sentiment would be that 2008 was a crash ignited by a catalyst (sub-prime mortgages) and that catalyst was large enough to be systemic.  Likewise we had the dot-com crash before that. I think a lot of people here are waiting for a crash as an indicator of recession, but we don't have a big enough catalyst for that, not one that's been identified yet at least. You can totally have a recession without a sudden crash, even though most redditors have not lived through such a type of recession yet.
