Most people think they can beat the market, but research has shown time and time again that even professional fund managers don't manage to do better than a coin flip most of the time over the long term.\n\nYes you see success stories. You see people posting about how much money they made, and how rich they've gotten. What you don't see is the many more people who don't post because they're actually worse off. \n\nMost people are best served by **investing in an index tracker**.\n\n**Warning over, now to the image**:\n\nThis is an app called Robinhood, which is largely concerned with options trading. I won't be defining everything, if you don't know what a term is you can find definitions on Investopedia.\n\nThe chart shows two main things changing over time, price and volume. The upper set of green and red bears denote price changes. Green bars mean the price rose in that period, red means it fell, with the size of the bar denoting the magnitude. Basically, price is on the Y axis and time on the Z.\n\nThe second set of green and red bars, below the first set, denote volume. That is, how much trading activity there is. Again, green means price rises, red means falls. The higher the bar, the higher the volume.\n\nThe number at the top is the current price, and the 4 letters below are the stock ticker, basically a shorthand way of referring to a given stock.\n\nThe number called \"Equity\" is simply the number of shares owned by this person multiplied by their current price.\n\nThe \"AVG cost\" is the average price paid for each share owned in this position E.G he may have bough some shares at 234, some at 228, or any combination of prices. This number helps evaluation of the position, as it gives an indicator of when the position has gains or losses.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions and I'll do my best to answer them.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "quick question for you, I'm a college student with not much to my name. my earning potential immediately after college is \\~30-40k, but about 10 years later should jump to around 300k+ if everything works out.
