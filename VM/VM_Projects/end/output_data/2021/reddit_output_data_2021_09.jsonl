He thinks the FSD solutions of the other manufacturers are actually viable options and have a potential to solve the problem. He thinks the disagreement should be held on the economics of implementing the different soiutions.\n\nHe doesnt understand that the solutions of the other manufacturers are stuck in a local optimum. Sure, they can manage to move a car, without hitting anyone. But lidar specifically cannot work well outside cities for instance. Where cars are fast and far away, rapidly approaching. Or where building and maintaining a high definition map of the enviornment is prohibitively expensive. Waymo will forever be limited to high density areas where there are enough customers to make it worth maintaining the maps.\n\nTesla on the other hand is building a system that solves the problem anywhere. Hardware is faaaar cheaper than lidar. Even if lidar costs drop. Also, they have to be fused with vision, so there is no way around having cameras and image processing. So its an added cost. It doesnt scale well. Neither in unit cost nor in fleet maintenance.\n\nOther manufacturers are faster, because they solve an easier problem. But they have no hope to solve the entirety of the problem. They will be forever limited.\n\nBut he DOES have a point if it comes in capturing part of the TAM. There will be customers moved by LIDAR systems in dense areas. So some companies might actually capture part of the demand without solving the problem in its entirety.

Because Palantir sells software and doesn't have to deal with large physical infrastructure and complex supply chains, I believe their business will go exponential faster than Tesla's has.  \n\nPLTR's market cap is currently in the 50B range.

I've just read the comments and someone says it may be fake:\n\n\nSteve Baker\n12 minutes ago (edited)\nI call *FAKE* - and I think I can explain how it was done.\n\nSo there are some things that are definitely real.  The building that's lit up with red lights that they start out next to is the Kiev university building - and if you look at the map display in the car and compare it to Google maps for that area, it's a good match...so this isn't something that was filmed at night in the USA and made to look like it was done in Kiev...that much is real.\n\n_HOWEVER_:\n\nThere are some fairly well-known hacks to put the Model 3 into various \"special\" modes - such as \"DEVELOPER MODE\" and \"FACTORY MODE\" - and at 4:07 in the video, you can see it says \"Factory Gateway\" in big red letters across the screen - in the same font, size and color as the display that warns you when the car is in various special testing or development modes.\n\nThis mode is, for 100% sure not available on any un-hacked Tesla - even if it has the FSD Beta installed.   So right here, we know that something fishy is going on.  This car has for sure been hacked...no doubt...no question whatever.\n\nThe hack is very well known - just google for it and you'll find easy instructions to turn it on.  https://fn.lc/post/tesla-model-3/ is a good starting point.  You need some fairly common hardware like a CAN-Bus interface - things which a car dealership or a University department might plausibly own.\n\nSo does a hacked non-FSD-beta car look like this one?\n\nElon Musk has said that he drives his car with developer mode on all the time - and that it displays a bunch of things you can't normally see.  This could plausibly explain why the graphics look like FSD's graphics...so this I believe could easily have been faked.\n\nThe car's display from 4:26 - which shows the forward camera with a bunch of annotations looks exactly like the developer mode display shown at the \"Autonomy Day\" demo a year or so ago...this, again, does NOT look like FSD...it's looks like Developer Mode.\n\nIn the daylight portions of the video - the car is driving extremely erratically - and this is NOT how the beta FSD drives...so this isn't what it claims to be.\n\nAnd if this car is a Ukrainian model - (which I think is likely when we see the street names written in cyrillic letters on the map display) - then why is all of the FSD stuff in English?   I very much doubt that developer mode has ever been translated into Ukrainian...or Russian for that matter.  The developers are all English speakers...so, again, this is a car that's been hacked to run in developer mode.\n\nAs I watch this, the camera is usually positioned so you can't see the guy's left hand...it's plausible that he's either steering with that hand or possibly with his knees or something...so I'm not even convinced that the car is driving itself anyway.   Changing the steering wheel icon to blue is an easy video hack.\n\nSo this video is VERY suspicious.\n\nIf I were a betting man - I'd say that somebody with a \"CAN-bus\" interface for a laptop has followed the instructions from (for example) here: https://fn.lc/post/tesla-model-3-modes/ - and used them to get into Developer and/or Factory modes - and used that to make a fairly convincing fake FSD video.\n\nIt's really REALLY unlikely that FSD is being beta tested in the Ukraine...just no.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Is this version 8 or something?!

Pushing past Amazon’s efforts at distraction and delay, only \none simple question is currently before the Commission in this proceeding: whether SpaceX \nprovided sufficient information on a proposed minor amendment to the application for its next-\ngeneration system for the Commission to seek public comment on that application.

That is because SpaceX has provided all information required under Commission \nrules and more information than necessary for the public and the Commission to evaluate all \naspects of its application. Nonetheless, Amazon is attempting to use a procedural gambit to\nprevent the public from even having the opportunity to provide feedback on the merits of SpaceX’s \napplication.\nSpaceX’s request at this point remains straightforward and simple. SpaceX asks only that \nthe Commission make its application available for comment from all members of the public—\nincluding Amazon’s legion of lobbyists and lawyers. Undoubtedly, Amazon will find a litany of \nother issues with the application to complain about. Nonetheless, that is what the comment cycle \nis for—to give the public the opportunity to build a complete record to assist the Commission in \nevaluating SpaceX’s application for its next-generation system.

Risk averse indeed. (Facepalm)\n\n\n\nTake a calculus class.  DCA only works in one specific curve, a curve in which some security (you've decided is the best of all possible choices) somehow takes a precipitous decline right after you buy it, and that decline becomes steep and prolonged long enough for you to accumulate in multiple tiny purchases.  Never mind that the security you decided was the best in breeds suddenly shit the bed, and didn't recover quickly.  Make sure you don't take off the blindfold to examine what conditions might have caused that, what might have led you to make such an objectively terrible call.  You just plow on.  \n\nNow, that same unpredictable security, the one that went from best to worst, and stayed worst, for a long time, now, that security has to have an epic comeback.  It has to deliver percentage performance gains exceeding the percentage losses it already delivered.  Only after that improbable and sustained long term sequence of events did DCA \"work\". \n\nHow I, and the successful part of the industry work is we watch that security.  If it is indeed quality, and we see it shit the bed with people like you riding its back, we watch and wait and assess why that happened.  We look at the events that caused it, the competition, the valuation, the upcoming catalysts, the landscape of the sector.  We see what the sum of parts are, and what cash per share exist as the now lower level.

I strictly buy just perishables at the supermarket and never have I ever felt any kind of pinch in that regard. \n\nI dont know what my exact point is but things like greens, broccoli, chickpeas, nuts, lentils, coffee, radishes, bananas, red onions, onions, carrots, spices, canned goods, rice, tomatoes, avocado, blueberries, bok choy, salmon, eggs, and so on have remained pretty steady in my eyes for many many years. \n\nI spend roughly 300-400 a month on groceries for myself and have been for quite awhile. I usually shop in chunks, about twice a week.  I dont feel it is unreasonable to spend that amount and am super comfortable with it as I cook and theyre mainly just ingredients. I spend my  own time making things out of it that you usually see bundled up in something you’d buy at a restaurant for like an exponentially insane price based on if you were to separate out the ingredients. \n\nFor example I see things like half a pre made sandwich for 2.78 If you were to make the bread yourself, buy the lunchmeat and cheese yourself, condiments as well you could make quite a few sandwiches on your own, like probable half a dozen or more I’m not sure Id have to break down the numbers. Those are made in house too at my grocery store so a lot goes into the price per for them to be profitable I suppose. \n\nAnyway, I guess if you dont mind putting in your own labor to produce your own meals, buying the ingredients, in my opinion is way worth it and thats what I do. $400 worth of groceries and In terms of volume of food, its usually way more than I need and it doesnt feel like Im rationing at all. \n\nFood prices if you eat out are going up and that is true, but I just never really see it in the grocery store with my shopping habits.

Where at safeway its 3.99 a pound. \n\nI understand i am shopping cheap and avoiding pricey retailers and im buying something most people wont but i just have to defend the idea that food prices are going up.

Sure, eventually.  A rate increase (which honestly I don’t even know will ever actually happen) could do it.\n\nOne issue is if inflation were to exceed even the pumped stock market returns (or perceived expected returns), then there would be a sell-off and reallocation to either just spending of the money and/or other assets (ie metals, commodities, real estate, etc).\n\nIf and when interest rates rise, it will be more expensive for debt-ridden businesses to take out loans to pay off loans, causing the amassing of even more debt.\n\nIt is somewhat disturbing the amount of debt that fortune 50 businesses have.\n\nIt’s nothing new, but total private and commercial debt is worth 1.5 to 2 times the worth of our whole economy.  Now, think about that…\n\nThe most expensive home in America’s development just recently went insolvent.  That can’t be a good sign…\n\n\nIf syndicated private business loans begin to default, it could start a cascade of sell-offs, last/resort leveraging of debt, forced liquidations, layoffs, etc.\n\nIf aggregate revolving credit utilization exceeds average collateral or liquidative value, then a total default is catastrophic and basically erases the economy.\n\nThere are downside backstops (at least in some areas of the economy), such as FDIC deposit account insurance (usually 250k), etc.\n\nExponential (steady %) continuous increase of the market is unsustainable, however logarithmic growth is sustainable.  If you look at the S&P (and many tickers, for that matter), you will see exponential growth curves (at times, the whole thing since April 2020, or exponential runs mixed in which failed).\n\n\nLet’s also consider the mechanics of price action in the market.  In order to go up (in theory, and ignoring volume issues) there must be more buyers than sellers at any point in time to increase the trading price.  For certain market participants the buying ability (aside from willingness) will become progressively smaller as the market rises exponentially and at a greater rate than income growth (which fit some parties it does, as no workers see their paycheck go up 20% if the S&P goes up 20% in some time period).\n\nAnd as the buying become progressively smaller, it increases the chances that there will be more sellers than buyers at any time, which starts downward price action.\n\nA lot in the market is about momentum and comparing metrics year over year or month to month or whatever.  So, consumer spending skyrocketed due in part to stimulus checks, and unemployment.  That caused amazing revenue reports that causes YoY beats, etc.  the spending surge cannot keep increasing.  What will happen?  Earnings reports going forward can’t continue to be positive YoY unless spending increases, which it cannot unless gross domestic wages keeps going up, which it is but not at a sufficient rate.\n\nThis is why “buy now pay later” things are the new hot fuss, because people have run out of money to spend to keep increasing aggregate spending.\n\nThere are other issues going on if the stock market were to continue to rise more than gross domestic wages, none of which are particularly peachy.\n\nHaving said all that, many components of the stock market are reasonably valued, but many are not.  With many, the dream of an idyllic future is driving up the valuations of businesses which do not have a net profit.\n\nHaving said all that, most parties within the categories of individuals, businesses, and the government do not want to see a market crash.

Using money velocity theory (money velocity is basically a metric for how much people spend). Let me first state some source and then explain the formula I'm using. I'll be doing calculations on rough estimates bcuz it's like 3 over here and I wanna head to bed:\n\n**M2 Money supply (M)**  \nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL the m2 money supply has grown about 5,000 billion since the beginning of corona, or has grown \\~33%. A good part of that growth can be attributed to the (digital) printing of extra money by the federal reserve.\n\n**GDP**  \nand here is the GDP: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP went up by about 4% since the start of corona.\n\n**M2 Money velocity (V)**  \nhere is the velocity of money for that money: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V\\~-20% since corona. people spend less.\n\n**Consumer price index (CPI)**  \nand finally the last one in america: https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/current-inflation-rates/ The last time it was this high was 2008. 5.4% up at the moment. (the fed says this is temporary but suppose it wasn't, they couldn't just announce this). But hey the new inflation numbers drop next tuesday so we'll be able to see if powel is bs-ing everyone.\n\n**Money velocity formula**  \nV = (CPI\\*GDP)/M  \nFinal thing before we can fill this bitch in is an understanding of index numbers, some quick examples before I fill this in: that 30% would be denoted as 1.3A -20% would be denoted as 0.8 etc. with that out of the way lets fill this bitch in.\n\n(1.05 \\* 1.04)/1.33 = 0.82\n\nthat's an 18% drop of money velocity roughly the 20 I eyeballed (if anyone want to do detailed calculations feel free to do so this is moreso to give you a general idea)\n\n**Ok so what then?**  \nThere are basically three scenario's here:\n\n1. people start spending more again (more likely) -> money velocity goes up -> (CPI\\*GDP)/M goes up -> unless the money supply goes down (spoiler it wont) the CPI\\*GDP part will have to go up. want back to pre corona levels of spending? (which were already declining for years on end) then CPI\\*GDP would need to be 1.25 (under the assumption they don't print even more money). Figure out for yourself which part of that 1.25 comes from CPI and which from GDP, either way it's going to be difficult to go back to pre covid spending levels without huge amounts of inflation.\n\n2. people will start spending less -> money velocity decreases -> (CPI\\*GDP)/M decreases -> either more money is printed once again (adding to the 28.5T gov debt (GDP is about 22T btw)) or CPI\\*GDP decreases. GDP would take a hit mostly and you might see deflation depending on how much less\n\n3. cba I've been writing for a while now and wanna head to bed, in this scenario people will keep spending about the same. I leave this as an excerise to the reader.\n\nFinal note to end this comment: Fed members have also been selling their personal stocks (or will at the latest by 30 sept) because of \"ethics concerns\", when the fed announces they will taper earlier than expected the market will shit itself. Historically most crashes have been in september so I guess there's that.\n\nSo I reckon the crash will hit within 3 months, probably within a month even.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["crash", "gdp", "deflation", "inflation", "cpi"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Because people spend all their time worrying about the left tail and never even consider the right tail", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15318289399147034}, {"body": "I'm still buying stocks, just what I can afford to lose of course.

So yeah not much changes. \n\nLet's get one thing out of the way. There are gradations of rich. I see four major breaking points:\n\nWorth $10mm-$30mm liquid (exclusive of value of primary residence).\n\nAt this level, your needs are met. You can live very comfortably at a 4-star/5-star level. You can book a $2000 suite for a special occasion. You can fly first class internationally (sometimes). You have a very nice house, you can afford any healthcare you need, no emergency financial situation can destroy your life. But you are not \"rich\" in the way that money doesn't matter. You still have to be prudent and careful with most decisions unless you are on the upper end of this scale, where you truly are becoming insulated from personal financial stress. (Business stress exists at all levels). The banking world still doesn't classify you as 'ultra-high net worth'\n\nNet worth of $30mm-$100mm\n\nAt this point, you start playing with the big boys. You can fly private (though you normally charter a flight or own a jet fractionally through Net Jets or the like), You stay at 5 star hotels, you have multiple residences, you vacation in prime time (you rent a ski-in, ski-out villa in Aspen for Christmas week or go to Monaco for the grand Prix, or Canne for the Film Festival--for what its worth, rent on these places can run $5k-20k+ per NIGHT.), you run or have a controlling interest in a big company, you socialize with Congressmen, Senators and community leaders, and you are an extremely well respected member in any community outside the world's great cities. (In Beverly Hills, you are a minor player at $80 million. Unless you really throw your weight around and pay out the nose, you might not get a table at the city's hottest restaurant). You can buy any car you want. You have personal assistants and are starting to have 'people' that others have to talk to to get to you. You can travel ANYWHERE in any style. You can buy pretty much anything that normal people think of as 'rich people stuff'\n\n$100mm-$1billion\n\nI know its a wide range, but life doesn't change much when you go from being worth $200mm-$900mm. At this point, you have a private jet, multiple residences with staff, elite cars at each residence, ownership or significant control over a business/entity that most of the public has heard of, if its your thing, you can socialize with movie stars/politicians/rock stars/corporate elite/aristocracy. You might not get invite to every party, but you can go pretty much everywhere you want. You definitely have 'people' and staff. The world is full of 'yes men'. Your ability to buy things becomes an art. One of your vacation home may be a 5 bedroom villa on acreage in Cabo, but that's not impressive. You own a private island? Starting to be cool, but it depends on the island. You just had dinner with Senator X and Governor Y at your home? Cool. But your billionaire friend just had dinner with the President. You have a new Ferrari? Your friend thinks their handling sucks and has a classic, only-five-exist-in-the-world-type of car. Did I mention women? Because at this level, they are all over the place. Every event, most parties. The polo club. Ultra-hot, world class, smart women. Power and money are an aphrodisiac and you have it in spades. Anything thing you want from women at this point you will find a willing and beautiful partner. You might not emotionally connect, but damn, she's hot. One thing that gets rare at this level? friends and family that love you for who you are. They exist, but it is pretty damn hard to know which ones they are.\n\n$1billion\n\nI am going to exclude the $10b+ crowd, because they live a head-of-state life. But at $1b, life changes. You can buy anything. ANYTHING. In broad terms, this is what you can buy:\nAccess. You now can just ask your staff to contact anyone and you will get a call back. I have seen this first hand and it is mind-blowing the level of access and respect $1 billion+ gets you. In this case, I wanted to speak with a very well-known billionaire businessman (call him billionaire #1 for a project that interested billionaire #2. I mentioned that it would be good to talk to billionaire #1 and B2 told me that he didn't know him. But he called his assistant in. \"Get me the xxxgolf club directory. Call B1 at home and tell him I want to talk to him.\" Within 60 minutes, we had a call back. I was in B1's home talking to him the next day. B2's opinion commanded that kind of respect from a peer. Mind blowing. The same is true with access to almost any Senator/Governor of a billionaires party (because in most cases, he is a significant donor). You meet on an occasional basis with heads-of-state and have real conversations with them. Which leads to\n\nInfluence. Yes, you can buy influence. As a billionaire, you have many ways to shape public policy and the public debate, and you use them. This is not in any evil way. the ones I know are passionate about ideas and are trying to do what they feel is best (just like you would). But they just had an hour with the Governor privately, or with the Secretary of Health, or the buy ads or lobbyists. The amount of influence you have can be heady.\n\nTime. Yes, you can buy time. You literally never wait for anything. Travel? you fly private. Show up at the airport, sit down in the plane and the door closes and you take off in 2 minutes, and fly directly to where you are going. The plane waits for you. If you decide you want to leave at anytime, you drive (or take a helicopter to the airport and you leave. The pilots and stewardess are your employees. They do what you tell them to do. Dinner? Your driver drops you off at the front door and waits a few blocks away for however long you need. The best table is waiting for you. The celebrity chef has prepared a meal for you (because you give him so much catering business he wants you VERY happy) and he ensures service is impeccable. Golf? Your club is so exclusive there is always a tee time and no wait. Going to the Super bowl or Grammy's? You are whisked behind velvet ropes and escorted past any/all lines to the best seats in the house.\n\nExperiences. Dream of it and you can have it. Want to play tennis with Pete Sampras (not him in particular, but that type of star)? Call his people. For a donation of $100k+ to his charity, you could probably play a match with him. Like Blink182? There is a price where they would simply come play at your private party. Love art? Your people could arrange for the curator of the Louvre to show you around and even show you masterpieces that have not been exhibited in years. Love Nascar? How about racing the top driver on a closed track? Love science? Have a dinner with Bill Nye and Neil dGT. Love politics? have Hillary Clinton come speak at a dinner for you and your friends, just pay her speaking fee. Your mind is the only limit to what is available. Because donations/fees get you anyone.\nThe same is true with stuff. You like pianos? How about owning one Mozart used to compose music on? This is the type of stuff you can do.\n\nIMPACT. Your money can literally change the world and change lives. It is almost too much of a burden to think about. Clean water for a whole village forever? chump change. A dying child need a transplant? Hell...you could just build and fund a hospital and do it for a region.\n\nRESPECT. The respect you get at this level is just over-the-top. You are THE MAN in almost every circle. Governors look up to you. Fortune 500 CEOs look up to you. Presidents and Kings look at you as a peer.\n\nPERSPECTIVE. The wealthiest person I have spent time with makes about $400mm/year. i couldn't get my mind around that until I did this: OK--let's compare it with someone who makes $40,000/year. It is 10,000x more. Now let's look at prices the way he might. A new Lambo--$235,000 became $23.50. First class ticket internationally? $10,000 becomes $1. A full time executive level helper? $8,000/month becomes $0.80/month. A $10mm piece of art you love? $1000. Expensive, so you have to plan a bit. A suite at the best hotel in NYC $10,000/night is $1/night. A $50million home in the Hamptons? $5,000. There is literally nothing you can't buy except.\n\nLove. Sorry to sound so trite, but it is nearly impossible to have a normal emotional relationship at this level. It is hard to sacrifice for another person when you are never asked to sacrifice ANYTHING. Money can solve all problems for someone, so you offer it, because there is so much else to do. Your time is SOOOO valuable that you ration it.

ADRs. There is nothing special here another than that ADRs are an instrument that allow foreign equities to be traded on US exchanges by having a issuer hold the actual shares in question. There are many ADRs and most of them aren't even Chinese. If you buy BP or RCEHY, etc which are UK listed companies on NYSE you are buying an ADR.\n\nADRs have issuers, these are large financial entities that hold the shares on behalf of the ADR owners. In BABA case this is Citibank.\n\nOk, so ADRs aren't scary at all. The thing you are really worried about but don't know the name of is VIE, or Variable Interest Entity.\n\nVIEs look scary and in the classical sense do carry some risk because they were developed explicitly to enable investment in areas the Chinese government has yet to approve (or has explicitly disallowed) foreign investment. They were first used by the Chinese telecom companies, namely China Telecom to expand their network and grow rapidly despite China banning direct foreign investment in telecommunications infrastructure. \n\nSo VIEs are definitely a gray area but there are some very important factors to take into consideration when looking at BABA in particular.\n\nFirstly the Caymans holding company isn't just some empty shell company as FUDsters would have you believe. It actually wholy owns the vast majority of the ~600+ entities that make up Alibaba, including all of it's non-China assets (Lazada, etc) and the vast majority of it's on-shore assets (Taobao, TMall, etc).\n\nHowever some parts of Alibaba's business are under investment restrictions, either due to holding sensitive licenses or IP. These portions of the business have VIE contracts with the Caymans holding company and sub-license the IP and licenses etc to the actual profit generating entities.\n\nSo in effect buy buying HK listed shares OR the NYSE ADR you have direct equity ownership in about 80% of the Alibaba entities (which account for about 99.99% of the profit) with the remaining 20% being controlled via VIE.\n\nAs for VIE legality itself there has been a lot of indications recently that VIE will either be moved out of the gray and regulated directly by Chinese authorities (see the new data security review mandate for foriegn listings) and the recent Shanghai IPO of Megvii which uses a VIE structure.\n\nSo yeah, VIE FUD is a complete nothing-burger at this point unless soemthing -very- drastically changes.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Whoa.

Tesla feels cheap. A lot of the plastic in them feels about like my parents Honda. Except the fit and finish isn't even as good as their Honda. Apple never would have got to the point they're at if their quality control was as bad as Teslas.\n\n>Porsche or Lexus is where with developing full self driving?😂 How much data ? 😂 bruh.\n\nToyota has L2 out in Japan, the same level that Tesla is at. If Tesla was at L3/L4/L5 while everyone else was at L2, that would be a huge advantage. Toyota and VW also have 100x the vehicles on the road as Tesla.

That would be like saying \"why the hell would anyone pay five times as much for a Porsche Sedan when you can just buy a Honda Civic?\". \n\nYou may not be aware of this, but the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y are considered luxury vehicles, so even though the Model 3 is more expensive then a Civic or a Prius it's not in the same class.\n\nSecond, have you looked at the prices Tesla, VW, Toyota, Honda, BMW, etc. charge for BEV's and compared them? For cars in the same class Tesla is most certainly **not** double the price of their competition.\n\nThird, the price of BEV's is going to continue to go down overtime as the technology behind batteries and their manufacturing process continues to improve. The most batteries that are produced the farther the costs are likely to go down as the manufacturers gain more experience and learn how to better improve their products. \n\n> Also, I think the stock is really high due to Elon Musk and young adults worshipping him like he’s some sort of prophet. That whole visiting space etc is so far away, Tesla is a $200 stock, way overvalued.\n\nThe cool factor of Musk, and his proven record at his companies definitely helps increase their stock price. But despite it's very high valuation today that doesn't mean that the company is going to fail and get beaten out by the competition. \n\nYou're clearly familiar with a lot of the Tesla bear case talking points. However I'd suggest looking into some of the long term Tesla growth projections if you want to understand the stock.

It got beat out by Ferrari, which makes maybe 10k cars a year. One of the biggest manufacturers in the US, and one of the only US car companies to never go bankrupt isn't even valued as highly as racing team that also happens to make a few sportscars for rich assholes. \n\nOnly one of the legacy automakers even cracks a $100 billion valuation. For comparison, Apple has a market cap that's *10 times larger* than Toyota, and over *25 times the size* of most of the companies on this list. You could add them all together and it wouldn't add up to one Apple, or Google or Microsoft. Hell, this entire list isn't even worth, in investor's eyes, as much as a single Facebook, and that hellhole is barely worth a trillion dollars.\n\nTesla isn't overvalued compared to the rest of the industry. It's the only auto company that's valued as if it might continue to grow and be profitable for the next decade or two. The rest of these companies are valued like investors hope to get a few years of dividends out of them and then dump them before they go bankrupt. And it kind of makes sense, countries and states around the world are talking about making their only profitable products illegal to sell within in the next 10-15 years. \n\nLegacy automakers have had 20-30 years to figure out how to make EVs, the only product they could conceivably make that will be profitable long term, and they've mostly sat on their thumbs and pretended global warming wasn't happening for most of that time. It took a tech startup out of California to show the *entire industry* that it was possible to make good EVs, profitably, and the rest of the industry is still trying to copy them. Hell, Toyota, the largest automaker in the world, isn't even sure yet that EVs are worth investing in in any significant way.

He also says, he expects a 2-3x from here which can be almost bearish on this sub (I personally believe it will be much higher). However, he has proven he has the ability as active investor to potentially outperform TSLA stock performance, even if higher than 2-3x.\n\nHe did say his thesis changed by underestimating how big the EV market is.
