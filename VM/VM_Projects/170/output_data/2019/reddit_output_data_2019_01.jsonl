{"title": "Let’s discuss the elephant in the room - 5G", "selftext": "After painstaking research tonight I’ve come to the conclusion that 5G will be the next millionaire maker among us. And that the entire US-China trade war is all about which country gets to dominate the 5G space in the next few years. The arrest, the IP theft, entire dispute is all about who will dominate 5G. And rightly so, as it will be a game changer. \n\nMy approach to playing 5G is this... \n\nRight now buy AMERICAN cell tower companies. AMT, CCI, SBAC. These companies are holding gold in the form of cell towers. They’ve barely flinched in the December massacre. Some at all time highs already, and looking like a new uptrend is starting. \n\nStay away from telecom service providers like Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T etc because they will be the ones paying cell tower companies up their ass to use the towers. They are already investing heavily and will drain their pockets initially. They’re profits will gain years down the line as every noob wants the new “5G” phone and the system becomes main stream. \n\nStay the absolute fuck away from cable companies like CMCSA. 5G will enable faster wireless internet into your home without the use of cables. \n\nPossibly go long on 5G gadget suppliers and fiber companies. NOK, ERIC, GLW, ZAYO. They will be relied on heavily to get the infrastructure up. \n\nI will not be investing in Apple, Intel, AMD, QCOM etc YET. These companies are still a year or maybe more from seeing profits from 5G.\n\nAlso, YOLO everything on Apple when they do release their 5G Iphone. Not many people will pay for $1000+ Iphone because it doesn’t have a home screen button, but huge amounts of their loyal customers will pay even more to switch to the new 5G Iphone. \n\nI’m betting my nut sack the US will not concede 5G to China, and they’ll put tremendous pressure on their allies AKA client states to tow the line and not proceed with allowing China to develop their nations telecommunications networks. \n\nIn the event of a down turn in the US markets for 2018, I will continue to buy the cell tower companies and accumulate their shares. Although tech will get raped as we have seen in a down turn, these companies will remain relatively strong and give me more of a chance to accumulate. Plus they pay good dividends. \n\ntldr: Buy American cell tower companies for 5G rollout. Consider 5G equipment suppliers as well. Stay away from normie tech stocks in case of headwinds in US market. Short cable companies to the earths core.\n\nEDIT: upon more reading, I am leaning towards NOK for hardware, GLW and ZAYO for fiber, CCI for small antennae, fiber, and already existing 4G infrastructure which will be used in some way to incorporate 5G (Idgaf what you retards say the cell towers will 100% be incorporated into 5G rollout). Cell tower co’s know this and are giving great forward guidance because of this. Also possibly DY for construction and engineering of the infrastructure. And maybe SWKS and QCOM for parents. \n\nAlso the cable companies might consolidate, and they own a shit load of fiber networks which will be valuable for service providers. They are good targets for mergers and acquisitions HOWEVER if they decide they want to use 5G for their services it will cost them immensely to change their systems to stay relevant. So risky plays there. \n\nAlso hoping this weeks earnings show some weakness in the market and we get a bit of bear action going. \n\nI want to invest in this 5G portfolio early to mid 2019 hopefully after a strong pullback in the market. \n\nIf no strong pullback I will jump in and hedge with SPY puts 20% OTM with 0.5% of my portfolio as insurance recurring every month, buying puts 2 months till expiration. Need insurance in case we dive this year and I end up investing near the upper range of my 5G portfolio. \n\nIf market tanks I sincerely think the 5G infrastructure roll out will be the next catalyst for the next bull market. I will go balls deep on 5G stocks if market tanks. \n\nThx ", "id": "akj164", "created_utc": 1548643828.0, "score": 259, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 161, "comments": [{"body": "I work in the space, your thoughts about tower companies is wrong. 5G antennas are mounted on buildings.
