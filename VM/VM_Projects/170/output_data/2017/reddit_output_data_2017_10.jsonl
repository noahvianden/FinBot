Because Alexa’s brain is in the AWS cloud, her new abilities are available to all Echo customers, not just those who buy a new device,” said Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO. “And it’s working — customers have purchased tens of millions of Alexa-enabled devices, given Echo devices over 100,000 5-star reviews, and active customers are up more than 5x since the same time last year. With thousands of developers and hardware makers building new Alexa skills and devices, the Alexa experience will continue to get even better.”", "id": "78y6p6", "created_utc": 1509048317.0, "score": 171, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 161, "comments": [{"body": "I bought over $1,000 worth of furniture and fixtures and household items for my new apartment from Amazon this past quarter, all you guys can thank me before you thank Jeff.
