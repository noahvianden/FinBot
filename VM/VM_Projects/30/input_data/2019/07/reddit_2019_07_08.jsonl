You'd need a massive amount of upfront capital, and you'd lose money until you could acquire those same subsides. Even after that, the margins are thin, risk is high, and the industry operates on boom-bust cycles, making your investment volatile. \n\nBombardier was already an existing aircraft manufacture in the business/private jet  space, and tried to encroach on Boeing's and Airbus's commercial jet market with the C-Series aircraft. They failed horribly. They had big supply chain problems, had a few high profile engineering issues, and Boeing leveraged their influence over the US Government to slap tariffs on the plane with questionable accusations of price-dumping as justification. Even after being bailed out by the Quebec government, they were forced to sell of the C-Series to Airbus. Bombardier has since sold off their remaining commercial aircraft programs (Q400 and CRJ) to focus on exclusively on business/private jets.\n\nAlso, Embraer, the only other commercial aircraft competitor, has been acquired by Boeing in a deal expected to close by the end of 2019. \n\nSo yeah, good fucking luck with your commercial jet manufacturing business. The only two aircraft manufacturers that got close have since had their assets or entire company bought out by the duopoly.
