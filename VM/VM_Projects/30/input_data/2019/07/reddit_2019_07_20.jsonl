{"title": "Here’s Why Netflix’s Problems Have Only Just Begun", "selftext": "Netflix ￼ has a problem. The company’s strengths—including scale, value, and a vast library—may not be enough to make up for shortfalls in show quality. And no one, not even Netflix, can make a hit every time.\n\nBefore Netflix’s earnings report this past Wednesday, the bull case for the stock was that the streaming giant’s world-wide subscriber base of 150 million was still a starting point. Plus, there were millions of existing subscribers who wouldn’t balk at higher prices. \n\nBut Netflix’s aura of invincibility is under question after the company stunned Wall Street with subscriber growth that came in nearly 45% lower than Netflix’s own projections.\n\nFor its second quarter, Netflix added 2.8 million net new international subscribers and lost 126,000 U.S. users, versus Wall Street expectations for 352,000 domestic additions and 4.8 million international adds. Netflix had forecast a total of five million new subscribers. The company’s shares fell 10% on Thursday, a day after the results. They fell another 3% on Friday. \n\nRosenblatt Securities analyst Mark Zgutowicz noted that prior selloffs have proven to be buying opportunities for Netflix’s stock, but this time could be different. \n\n“Our two concerns that this dip may not be like the old times are: this is an unprecedented miss and competition is on the horizon,” Zgutowicz wrote in a report. “Netflix has never missed an international subscriber guide by this much.”\n\nPricing and content are the two critical issues in the disappointment. In its second-quarter letter to shareholders, the company said, “Our missed forecast was across all regions, but slightly more so in regions with price increases.”\n\nNetflix unveiled price increases in January. Its standard high definition streaming plan in the U.S. rose by 18% to $13 a month, but new pricing was rolled out gradually, perhaps giving a false impression of pricing power in the first quarter of the year. Given the June-quarter results, Netflix subscribers may still be rational consumers sensitive to higher costs. \n\n“The drop in U.S. subscribers suggests that viewers on lower pricing tiers dropped Netflix as a result of the price increase,” eMarketer analyst Eric Haggstrom wrote in an emailed statement.\n\nThe more worrisome issue may be content. Netflix admitted the weakness of its second-quarter releases were also a factor in its subscriber miss. \n\n“We don’t believe competition was a factor since there wasn’t a material change in the competitive landscape,” the company said in its letter. “Rather, we think Q2 content slate drove less growth in paid net adds than we anticipated.”\n\nNetflix said its current quarter has started off strong thanks to the third season of Stranger Things, which was released earlier this month. That’s good news now, but it just confirms subscribers’ insatiable desire for engaging new content. Netflix is on the hook for a Stranger Things-like hit every quarter if it wants to hit its growth target. \n\nRival content makers are no longer helping. In its latest investor letter, Netflix reminded shareholders that most of its Disney ￼ content, along with Friends and The Office, will leave the service in the coming years. According to third-party measurement services, Friends and The Office are two of the most-watched shows on Netflix. \n\nIn June, NBCUniversal announced its new streaming service would have exclusive domestic streaming rights for The Office starting in 2021. Earlier this month, WarnerMedia said Friends would be exclusive its HBO Max service when it launches next spring. \n\nThe company tried to minimize the departures by saying its most popular current titles are only a “low single digit percentage” of the streaming hours viewed and any content lost will free up money for other offerings. It will have to find those offerings in an increasingly competitive environment.\n\nDisney is set to launch its new Disney+ streaming service on Nov. 12 at a price of $7 a month, about 45% lower than Netflix’s standard plan. In its first year, Disney plans to have a library of 7,500 TV episodes and 500 movies—including the company’s Pixar, Star Wars, and Marvel films.\n\nEven Netflix bulls admit that investors will be hyper-focused on further subscriber growth hiccups in the coming quarters.\n\n“If Netflix misses subs in the quarters after Disney+ launches, the market will make the correlation anyway, and we expect the downside effect on Netflix stock will be several times more than usual,” Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger, who has an Outperform rating on Netflix shares, wrote last week.\n\nSo what is the setup for Netflix stock here? Last month, Barron’s said Netflix was priced for perfection and facing risk from increasing streaming competition. To be sure, we’ve been wrong on Netflix stock in the past, including in an August 2017 cover story. But the bearish argument may finally be playing out. \n\nRising government scrutiny over the power of big technology companies also makes it unlikely there will be any near-term acquisition bid for Netflix, a longtime source of support for the stock. \n\nEven with the shares down 13% since early June, Netflix stock trades at 65 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months. The elevated multiple doesn’t seem to factor in the current risks.\n\nNetflix ended its earnings call for investors this past week by congratulating competitor HBO for its record-breaking 137 Emmy nominations this year. \n\n“They continue to be the gold standard that we chase, and we’re really thrilled for them,” Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos said.\n\nThat was a gracious gesture, but it’s also one more important reminder: Content always wins. \n\nSource: Barron's", "id": "cflkwb", "created_utc": 1563627829.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "Coupled with all of this their platform has never been easy to use.

It's how the legacy cable companies think, exclusivity is what they see as the best way to make money off of their shows, rather then putting it on as many networks/streaming services as possible. Netflix knew if they didn't start making their own stuff they'd be screwed long term from lack of good content in their libraries.\n\nBut now so many streaming services have just 1 or 2 shows worth watching, which is causing a lot of people to subscribe for just a month or two and then cancel their subscription.

Management knows this and has therefore raised subscription prices to fuel the bottom line growth, but instead, people have decided to cut their accounts.\n* Netflix's most popular programs are owned by other networks/production companies that could pull the program off of the platform at anytime they wish, i.e. CBS & Disney, and set up direct competition nearly overnight with their own programs (it's already started with Disney+). Netflix has tried to counter this with varying success by creating original content, but creating a viral new show every year has a relatively small success rate, and it's very capital intensive.\n* Even if Netflix's original content is a massive success, it doesn't directly translate to cash; in order to make more money from their series/movie, they need new users to subscribe just for that series/movie, including revenues from licensing deals. They don't make any more money from users who already pay the subscription fees (great for us, not so great for them).\n* It's valuation is considerably expensive for what is essentially a growth story that's now nearly fully grown and looking for a way to fuel future earnings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm confident in Reed Hastings & co. given their track record, but Netflix is clearly entering a pivotal moment for the company in which they will be forced to innovate or die. Perhaps they could branch into gaming and stream popular titles using cloud networks and offering an enhanced subscription that allows users to do so on various devices. Or, they could offer interactive films that allow the viewers to engage and manipulate the storylines, creating repeat views of similar titles. Netflix could possibly look into creating small satellite boutique movie theaters in popular areas and offer a luxurious go-to-the-movies experience to anybody with a certain level of subscription.
