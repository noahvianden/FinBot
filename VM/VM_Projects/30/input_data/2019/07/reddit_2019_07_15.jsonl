General thoughts on equities are that they are overbought with lots of potential downside. See MS’s “downgrading global equities,” JPM’s “earnings season going to be brutal,” etc. \n\n2. Volume has been super low recently. Big money can’t exit positions without tanking the market. It’s hands are tied because it needs a healthy market. \n\n3. Earning reports boost liquidity, especially to the upside on good reports. \n\n4. Therefore, big money will use this “last round of good earnings” before things really get ugly as a means to exit positions.  \n\n5. The result: good ERs will lead to no jump in stock price or even a dip. \n\nSo far this has held up with PEP, DAL, and now C.
