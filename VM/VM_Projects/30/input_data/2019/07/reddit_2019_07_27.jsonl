That said, there are some crucial mental lapses being demonstrated here--the most glaring of which is the fact that one stock represents 46% of your portfolio. Now, I'm all for simplicity and focus, but this is also unnecessarily risky. It sounds like this is more of a result of you throwing money at a falling stock so you can hope to recover some of your losses, rather than just shifting your focus to an asset/holding that generates returns. Here's the thing with long term shareholding though--if you're going to do it right; you've got to be okay with seeing large drops in share value sometimes. By large I mean 40, 50, 60%+ drops in share value. It happens. But, if you are cut out for the game of investing, this shouldn't scare you. It's something you have to be willing to ride out. In general, it is imperative to hold companies that have a durable competitive advantage at a price which ensures a reasonable margin of safety. That way, when these drops happen, you won't be worried. For Boeing specifically, they'll get back on track at some point, but this 737 MAX repair is taking much longer than expected, and the company's sales are certainly being impacted, especially because their main (and only) competitor, Airbus SE, manufactures worthy competing aircraft. Personally, before I'd start buying Boing again, I'd want this 737 MAX problem to be solved first, with a clear indicator that sales are back on the rise and customer confidence is restored.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the long , thoughtful response!

Since I know absolutely nothing about what is happening at Boeing right now, I would like to know exactly how they plan & execute themselves out of this 737 MAX mess before I put money into it. It's not like I have to buy Boeing anyways. I want to know what I'm buying into. If the price ends up being expensive, then I obviously won't buy it. I'm totally comfortable not buying Boeing, and I'm in no rush. In short, I'm not going to literally invest myself into a problem without a clear solution *and* proof that the solution is working.\n\nAnd here's other concerns I have about this 737 MAX issue before I mindlessly buy the stock because it's gone down: 1) The creation of the 737 MAX was a rushed **response** to Airbus' A320 Neo, which indicates that Airbus not only caught up with the world's most bought aircraft, but beat it technologically right under management's nose. You have to remember that the whole reason MCAS was implemented was to fix the aerodynamics issue caused by moving the new jet engines further forward on the wing, which can pitch the nose of the aircraft unnecessarily higher. 2) What if this isn't purely a software issue for the 737 MAX? Particularly, if any hardware needs to be amended, it's going to be an incredibly expensive fix to change the way all the 737 MAX aircraft are constructed. There have already been murmurings from FAA test pilots that MCAS wouldn't be the only required fix in order to gain re-approval. 3) And when the 737 MAX issue is resolved, then what? What's the incentive for airlines to buy a 737 MAX over a problem free Airbus Neo? How would customers react to knowing they're seated on an infamous aircraft? Would airlines just be smart and avoid that issue entirely by buying non-MAX planes? That's certainly something I would consider. All of these MAX problems can absolutely be--and likely will be--resolved by Boeing, but they've lost their customers' trust with this particular aircraft; it may never sell at the same rate again. It's probably better for Boeing to fix it, and focus on a new aircraft to replace the MAX that just isn't called MAX in all honesty.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I just wanted to say thank you for this comment.
