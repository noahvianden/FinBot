You could debate whether those things actually constitute less risk of default on loans, but then you would have already admitted that people think about more than just credit ratings.\n\nThis is not to say the banks won’t try to use the credit rating to their advantage in securing the highest rate.

Tilray's press release is  misleading, ***based on my understanding*** (happy to be corrected, if wrong). Here's why. Privateer itself might not sell...fine. But Tilray also did a venture round in early 2018, and I believe those shares are part of this lockup expiration as well. Per their most recent 10-Q:\n\n>In February and March 2018, the Company issued an aggregate of 7,794,042 shares of Series A preferred stock at an issue price of $7.10 ($8.90 CAD) per share. In July 2018, the Company completed its IPO, whereby 10,350,000 shares of our Class 2 common stock were sold at a price of $17.00 ($22.45 CAD) per share, which included 1,350,000 shares pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. Upon the closing of the IPO, all shares of the outstanding Series A preferred stock automatically converted into 7,794,042 shares of Class 2 common stock on a one-for-one basis.\n\nSo I'm fairly sure that 7.79M shares will get registered and become tradable in the next few days, and I've yet to see a press release saying that VC firm doesn't intend to sell. So what does this mean? Well--again, based on my understanding--Tilray's current market cap right now is an insane $9.22B. The total shares, based on the filings seem to be:\n\n* 75,000,000 shares owned by Privateer, which they say they do not \"intend\" to sell.\n* The 7.79M shares sold in a venture round in February of last year. Those guys bought at $7.10, and are on a 13.9x return based on the current stock price\n* The 10.35M shares issued in the IPO.\n\nThose shares x the share price does get really close to the listed market cap, so I'm fairly sure that math is correct.\n\nThis seems to imply that the relevant number of shares actually being traded will go from 10.35M to an amount close to 18.1M. And those guys are sitting on huge profits. So I think we're looking at a mere 75% increase in shares being traded...\n\nIf this is wrong, please let me know.\n\nAnyway, this has been a painful day, but not nearly as painful as I thought.
