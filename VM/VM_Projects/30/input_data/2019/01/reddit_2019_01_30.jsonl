You’re correct when it comes to issuing shares, I never disagreed with you there. I was referring to outstanding shares. Through share buybacks and other means, the number of outstanding shares varies depending on the company size, their profitability, etc. For example, Apple is very profitable and they are repatriating like $200B back to the US from overseas which can/will go back towards shareholders in the form of share buybacks sending the stock higher. Supply and Demand. \n\nFrom Investopedia: “A company’s outstanding shares can fluctuate for a number of reasons. The number will increase if the company issues additional shares. Companies typically issue shares when they raise capital through an equity financing, or upon exercising employee stock options (ESO) or other financial instruments. **Outstanding shares will decrease if the company buys back its shares under a share repurchase program.”** \n\nTherefore, smaller, less profitable companies don’t have the equity or capital readily available to repurchase shares.

I literally posted a link to a source that proves my argument.\n\nIf you issued 500m shares and only 400m shares are outstanding because you, as the major shareholder and founder own 20% of the company, then investors can purchase any of the 400m shares on the open market. However, if the company would like to reward shareholders in the form of share buybacks rather than in the form of dividends, you will use your free cash or capital to purchase some of the 400m outstanding shares..... with less shares outstanding, there will be less supply but the same demand for the stock so the stock price will rise.... you can google Share Buybacks anytime, you're more than welcome to. \n\nThe \"size\" of the company in this case means the capitalization of the company in the open market. And the \"profitability\" matters because an unprofitable company can't afford to buy shares back. Look at Tesla, they don't buy shares back because they don't have the capital to do so. Apple (a profitable company) on the other hand has $400B+ of capital to deploy in share buybacks. \n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042015/why-would-company-buyback-its-own-shares.asp \n\nI can post more links for you and continue getting downvoted but no one else commenting on this post has even come close to a factual answer like the one that I posted.

OP was asking why there are some companies with only a few million shares outstanding yet worth so much (Berkshire) compared to companies with hundreds of millions yet not expensive (Apple). The capitalization size of the company matters because smaller capitalized companies buying back $10M back in stocks will affect their stock a lot more than a larger capitalized company buying back $10M in stock. \n\nThe same thing can be said for profitability. The more profitable a company is = more capital = more dividends OR more buybacks = less outstanding shares. e.g. Berkshire, Apple. \n\nThe size and profitability has nothing to do with the number of shares that they **issue** but it does have a lot to do with the number of shares that are **outstanding**. \n\nI'm done responding to you, you're literally trolling me at this point.
