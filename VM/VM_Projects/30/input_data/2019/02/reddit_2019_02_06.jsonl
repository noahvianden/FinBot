Unlike Netflix, it has a diverse revenue stream where resorts make up nearly one third and are very profitable. Disney World is 60 square miles, which is the same size as San Francisco and it has parks all around the world. The parks in America are so full that Disney is forced to raise prices and is getting attacked for pricing out the middle class. \n\nAs for streaming, this whole comparison with Netflix is so bloated and destined to die down as more options become available including streaming Live TV. It’s not Netflix versus Disney, because Netflix is losing 20 percent of its content this year and has literally been forced to create its own content because everyone wants to do it on their own. In the end, Netflix will be nothing more than a studio like Universal, Disney, Warner or whatever else... it may be successful but I don’t know how they can sustainable be profitable. At least in a way to justify its extreme valuation. \n\nNetflix may have subscribers but there is nothing other than Netflix Original Content from preventing its customers from hitting the cancel button. Yes, the content can be decent but what happens when customers must choose between providers because everything is direct to consumer? Netflix HD costs $14, HBO costs $15, Amazon is $13, CBS is $10, YouTube Is free, and now there is YouTube TV for $40 and Hulu TV for $40 among a dozen other streaming platforms. Who knows, someone like Apple or Google may develop a platform that allows it all to be bundled and organized into one place, as if it were a modern version of smart TV channels that use the Internet instead of cable. \n\nNo matter what, Disney is going to get a piece of the pie and probably one of the biggest. With its huge library of movies and TV shows it has produced over the past several decades, plus all of the other content it has acquired such as Netflix, ABC, etc. there is no way Disney won’t get customers. Can you imagine being able to watch any Disney movie, such as Pirates, Marvel, Star Wars, Toy Story, Lion King, Mary Poppins, or even ABC content such as the Bachelor, Dancing with the Stars, Once Upon a time, or perhaps National Geographic, or whatever Fox content there is out there? It’s going to be an insane success as long as it can present it in a quality streaming platform. Disney even has the news... \n\nPeople can argue all they want about Netflix Original content but it is spending somewhere around $10B on content each year, which only makes up 10 percent of what’s available. People talk about Disney being late to the party...  it’s Netflix whose late. Netflix is losing billions to increase its content by 10 percent while Disney is adding to its its immense content while being profitable.\n\nIn the end, Disney has incredible talent and a huge, high quality catalog of great content. It also has the power and brand to acquire or license more as fit, such as it has with Indiana Jones or Avatar. I don’t know how long it’ll take for Disney to present it with a great platform but I hope it’s 60 percent ownership in Hulu will help it develop a great program with a quality user interface. \n\nAs for your $40k - how you want to spend it is up to you and how much time you want to invest it for. If you’re thinking 10 plus years and think Disney can grow and dominate go for it. The best time to buy is all the time If you’re going for the long run. Keep buying and you’ll buy at the best times and the worst... but as long as it goes up you’ll do just fine. \n\n\n", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Nobody wants to get nickeled and dimed for all those channels.

I would like your post a lot more if you weren't completely biased against netflix vs disney, both can be great maybe both subscriptions are warranted to have.  Disney is caught in a pickle....how much of a monthly subscription does it need to be when you will lose money on the otherside with all your dvd/blue ray sales and merchandise.    People aren't going to buy a dvd if they can stream, if they are streaming they aren't at the store, which being at the store buying a movie helps aid the toys and book sales.  I see customers being initially pissed because lets face it people want disneys price to be comparable to netflix and I dont see that happening....so do they take the hit for a higher price or do they not allow streaming for new movies to get the dvd/blue ray says.\n\nHulu was a large loss...you are so focused on netflixs spending on original content and the cost....acquiring the 60% of hulu basically gave disney a 960 million dollar loss which was roughly 20% of netflixs spending in 2018.  Hulus platform is garbage and so is amazons, but even hulu still forces you to watch adds.   Imagine what Netflix could gain if they had us also watching ads mid episode.

From a market cap basis it is valued almost the same as Disney, but doesn’t even have one third the revenue. That means Netflix would need to triple its 120+ million subscriber base just to match Disney in revenue. I’m sure by then it would be pretty damn profitable but getting there is going to be one heck of a challenge. \n\nNetflix is burning over a billion in cash per quarter while Disney is making 2-3B.

Your point is moot.\n\n2) African reception to Chinese economic adventures, as seen during its spending spree inAfrica, isn’t without consequence. Africans aren’t modeling their countries’ to the Chinese model. Sure some crackpot dictator might be, but the people and in some cases the militaries tend to gravitate north and west, not east. And as seen, dictators can be overthrown. Unless the Chinese build massive amounts of bases in Africa and buoy the dictators’ military, they will only trade, not control Africa. According to your logic, if China is looking to model Africa in its own image vis a vis US did to China, then its highly unlikely China will succeed unless their footprint in Africa is larger. \n\n3) China is an inefficient economy. Although it will focus on shifting to consumer economy, there’s wide areas of China that won’t shift to consumer because of its inefficiencies. The lag of shifting is tremendous without growth and with wealth destruction, as seen in the west; China will eventually have to deal with during a slowing global economy. \n\n4) no, I don’t see monetizing data collection will be used to its full potential because the Chinese system itself isn’t founded on monetization. The Chinese foundation is control. \n\nDon’t forget what Karl Marx said (not verbatim and just using him because China is still officially a communist state), “you can’t have communism without first undergoing capitalism.” Clearly, China’s growth is under communist rule. A lot of Chinese will be left behind if not already. Very similar to the Soviet Union. And we know how that story played out. Hence, data collection in China is about control.
