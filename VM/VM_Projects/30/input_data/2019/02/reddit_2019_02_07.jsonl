Analysts generally earn in the six figures a year, but pay ranges widely by experience and securities firm.\n\n> Current and former analysts say those forces can cause them to err on the side of producing rosy research reports rather than jeopardize lucrative relationships with investor clients.\n\n> “It’s a decision I have to make on my sell-rated stocks: whether I will forgo the opportunity for corporate access, which clients will explicitly pay for,” says Laura Champine, a retail analyst at Roe Equity Research. Some previous bosses at other firms told her to “just drop coverage” instead of putting out sell ratings, she says, while declining to comment on where that happened.\n\n>”When your compensation is in part based on how many meetings you set up in a given year, it’s really tough to stick to your guns,” says Eric Hollowaty, a former analyst at Stephens Inc. who covered consumer companies.\n\n>Warren Stephens, the securities firm’s chairman, president and chief executive, says in a statement that analysts at Stephens “are encouraged to stay true to their convictions…even if it means less access for us.”\n\n>Analysts’ ability to arrange private events with management for clients is just a “minor aspect of compensation,” he says, adding that “turnover is very low among our analysts.”\n\n>A federal rule bars companies from selectively disclosing material nonpublic information but doesn’t prohibit private conversations with investors. Companies also are allowed to control how analysts and investors get access to corporate executives. Mutual funds and hedge funds, meanwhile, are happy to pay for the opportunity to pepper top executives with questions out of earshot of rival investors, possibly gleaning information to inform trading decisions.\n\n> The SEC said Deutsche Bank’s performance-evaluation system for analysts “assigned significant weight to analysts’ access to and relationships with the senior management of the companies they covered and the feedback that the firm received from its clients.”\n\n> Analysts received additional credit for securing meetings with chief executive officers and chief financial officers, the SEC said. The enforcement action didn’t conclude that the practice of investors paying analysts for corporate access creates a potential for conflicts of interest or other problems.\n\n> Many of them have a goal of increasing the number of “non-deal roadshows,” or marketing trips that aren’t tied to specific corporate transactions or stock sales but feature analysts taking executives to the offices of current and potential investors. The meetings allow executives to pitch an analyst’s clients on the company’s strategy and investment value.\n\n> More than 90% of companies go on such roadshows, according to a 2014 survey conducted by the National Investor Relations Institute trade group.\n\n> Banks and brokerages often poll large investors on the services they value most highly. Private meetings arranged by analysts are cited among the top reasons why investors steered trades through the banks and brokerages.\n\n> That decision is important because commissions from such trades are part of the lifeblood at many financial firms. Competition has intensified since the financial crisis because the pool of available commissions is shrinking from price cuts and the rise of automated trading.\n\n> David Strasser, a former retail analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, says some investors told him they had little interest in his research and were only paying for meetings he could set up with companies.\n\n>”I wanted to be valued for my analytical abilities, but arranging meetings became such a critical part of the job,” says Mr. Strasser, adding that he was sometimes asked to sit outside the room so investors could ask questions without him. In 2015, he left the research industry to join a venture-capital firm.\n\n> When Steve West was an analyst covering restaurants and grocery chains, many companies did roadshows only with analysts who had buy ratings, he says. Corporate access “became part of the overall calculus,” he adds.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "No, you are wrong on both fronts. \n\nBank research desks are not rewarded based on making correct calls. They are there to maintain access to the company for their clients and the investment bank. They get commission if a meeting they set up leads to a transaction.
