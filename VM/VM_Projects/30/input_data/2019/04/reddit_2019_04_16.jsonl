Last Q was the first time we really showed strong China growth, and if that is shown to continue and guide well then forget it, your puts are toast. Also, we literally just as of today implemented a new rewards program.\n\nKeep in mind 1 dollar=2 stars. So, our old program was just every 125 stars, or roughly 63 dollars spent, you get a free drink. The new system fucks you much better than the old one, though. Now, you have different levels. 25 stars gets you an extra shot of espresso or extra pump of syrup, 50 stars gets you a free coffee, and you don't unlock that same level of free food/drink until 200 stars, or roughly 100 dollars spent. At 400 stars you get a free pound of coffee or a mug. So basically, people are gonna be paying more to get less, and using their rewards more often on shit thats practically free for us anyway. So we are giving away free drinks less often AND customers are spending more to get those free drinks.\n\nI've been with the company four years and when I started, a small coffee was 2.00. It's now 2.33, and there's more traffic in my store now than when I started.

Basically, it only makes drinks for delivery people, no customer interaction. So this place just turns out bevs and then an alibaba courier will come pick it up and deliver it. Pretty insane.

It dropped from 85 to 68 in 2-3 days time\n2. MACD line is about to cross the signal line on the daily and go below. I believe I would wait until that confirmation.\n3. Histogram on the MACD shows signs of exhaustion meaning the green histogram seems to be in its ending phase.\n\nThe only non-technical factor against my DD above is that the market can remain irrational longer than we can stay solvent. But this 5/3 $74P play looks very interesting and I'll tag along with you on this.\n\nEDIT: Overall completely bullish on SBUX, but seems like a good time short.
