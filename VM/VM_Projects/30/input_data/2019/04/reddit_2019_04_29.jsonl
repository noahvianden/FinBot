In short, **some vertical spreads have a much higher chance of being profitable than others due to the market mispricing tail end risk around earnings - this screener attempts to identify them using historical data combined with live option data**. \n\nThe full web application can be [found here](http://earningsviz.com). A getting started page is [here](http://earningsviz.com/help). **I have included data on many of the companies reporting next week with weekly options available!**\n\nThe web application is very simple - there's a filter that you can use to look for tickers you're interested in, or you can sort by reporting date with the top buttons.\n\nPlease forgive me for the Spartan look of the website - I haven't had the time to make it look pretty; that being said, all the data you need is there and it should load pretty fast. That being said, let me know if you find any issues with the site or data being presented. \n\nI included a new page, \"Earnings\", that shows all the earnings events that I got data from, including the specific drops for each earning as well as a Google search button so you can do more research into why a stock rose/dropped from that earnings report.\n\n**Please let me know what you think, and I hope it helps for this coming earnings week!**\n\nSmall side note: I pulled the dataset today, meaning the data is from market close on Friday. As many of you probably know, option pricing data becomes inaccurate near 3:55pm with exaggerated bid/ask spreads; I'll pull a fresh set of data tomorrow when the market is open around 10:00 AM EST and it should have more accurate option prices.\n\n**UPDATE: 4/29/19 12:00 PM EST** - I have updated the data set! Everything should be much more accurate now. Sorry for the delay, I was caught up in a call.\n\n**UPDATE: 4/30/19 12:00 PM EST** - Added a toggle to switch between buying vs selling the vertical spreads; also updated all the data again.", "id": "bihylw", "created_utc": 1556496935.0, "score": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 27, "comments": [{"body": "Very interesting stuff.

{"title": "Thesis for Disney Long", "selftext": "I posted my thesis for buying Facebook a few months ago and as the price steadily approaches $200 a share, I find myself looking for new value stocks and keep coming back to the same conclusion.  Disney, though currently on a hot streak, is still severely undervalued and there is plenty of runway for them to grow.  With a market cap that is sitting at $250B, I have no question that this stock is going to break out in the short-term with many of the recent, but not new, revelations about this beloved company.  My investment thesis for this stock can be broken down into the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Core competency and extendable core:  Disney's core competency is its marketing ability.  Everything they touch becomes more valuable because they are able to create a complex network of their properties.  Let's take their fairly recent Marvel aquisition (this is an easy one to analyze).  You start off with a series of individual solid movies, all tied together and packaged neatly in a box titled Avengers.  The movies are all hits, bringing in revenues that are small fries compared to the merchandise that are sold such as clothing, toys, movies.  Their marketing has done so well that anything that bears the Disney or Marvel logo is synonymous with quality.  This combined with their economies of scale allows them to produce top notch content at a steep discount.  They were able to film both Avengers Infinity War and Avengers Endgame with a liberal estimate of <800 million dollars.  Just ticket sales alone for Endgame generated over 1.2B in revenue in just one weekend.  Not only that, but their abilities to create complex and high return webs is highly extendable.  I mean they own Star Wars.  I think they butchered the new movies, but that franchise is a cash cow.  It is almost criminally obvious that Disney is currently priced based on fundamental analysis instead of technical analysis.  That being said, a market cap of $250B is ridiculous which brings me to my next point.\n2. Comparables: Now before I begin on this point, Disney does not have any close comparables.  However, for arguments sake, let's take their biggest competitor, Netflix.  NFLX is sitting on a market cap of about $160B (on the conservative side).  That means that Disney, with all of its intellectual property, an upcoming competitive streaming service, high marketing potential, and positive cash flow is only worth \\~50% more than Netflix, a company dishing out money to maintain their streaming service and generate new content.  This means one of two things.  Either Netflix is overvalued or Disney is undervalued.  The likelihood is a combination of both.  It is already public information that Disney will be pulling all of its content from Netflix and releasing it on the highly anticipated Disney+.  I have yet to find the statistic on it, but I am confident that at least 20% of Netflix streaming hours are on Disney content.  You can bet that at a price point of $6.99 a month, Disney will be making money hand over fist with their new subscription service.  This brings us to number 3.\n3. Streaming:  To those who believe that Disney is late to the shootout, I do not mean to come off as rude, but that most likely means you do not understand the tides of the digital revolution.  Streaming is still in its infancy.  That would be like saying Facebook was late to social media because Myspace occupied the space.  God bless Netflix for paving the road, but now Disney is laying out the tracks.  This is the central point of my thesis:  Disney has not only found a way to create a subscription service for their wealth of content, they have done something much more important.  They have found a way to cripple their greatest competition while helping them build the framework.  Disney has been planning a streaming service for YEARS.  Why would they keep feeding Netflix their content if they were afraid of Netflix's user base?  It's because Disney was using Netflix as a testing ground.  Along with the dues Netflix pays to Disney, Disney also gets big data.  How many people are watching their shows/movies?  How many hours do people spend on their content?  They finally found the levels high enough to justify their own service.  They let Netflix do the legwork and Disney got paid for it.  Netflix NEEDS (needed) Disney.  Disney never needed Netflix.  In short, Netflix was a vessel to offset cost and test the streaming waters before Disney jumps in.\n4. Intangibles:  Disney is not a company you buy off its current financials.  Of course they're going to have high capital expenditures.  It is part of the network they are building that I mentioned in point 1.  When you see Mickey Mouse, when you see any Avenger, when you see any Star Wars character, you are seeing intangible assets that can not be priced on a financial statement.  I would argue that Marvel, Lucas Films, and Disney are worth more than a measly $250B.\n\nI have more that I can discuss, but these four points are the reason I placed an order today for 300 more shares of Disney at an average cost of $140.  Disney is at an all time high, but an investment at any level now will see returns in the double digits within the next year.  I am giving Disney a conservative market cap of $300B to at least put them near twice the worth of Netflix.  This would bring their stock to roughly $168 for a modest 20% gain.

The narrow moat that Netflix has is certainly there and I don't mean to discredit it.  I am simply qualifying my assumption that users will flock to Disney or add Disney+ to their streaming service portfolio at the low cost that is being offered.

Netflix doesn't really disclose a lot of info on movies, however of the most watched shows are the office, parks and rec, and friends. So it is not as if they are yanking the most watched shows (granted they might lose some of these shows in the upcoming years as NBC and other channels create their own services). \n\nMy best guess is in 5 years there will not be enough on content on D+ to keep it as a service without bundling it with espn+ and Hulu.  \n\nDisney needed them to handle the infrastructure which costs a lot.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "NBC is pulling out in 2021 IIRC", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Last I had heard they were just discussing pulling the office and parks when the contract expires, not that they had made a choice yet.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I have held Disney for the past few years and I am happy to see it getting positive attention lately.

If they try to hold back new content from the service they won't get the subscription numbers that they/we want to see and if they include the new content they will lose all those subscribers from pay per play services. Don't get me wrong I think it is the right move but it is not a obvious win win on all fronts.

Streaming is still in  its infancy.  That would be like saying Facebook was late to social  media because Myspace occupied the space.  God bless Netflix for paving  the road, but now Disney is laying out the tracks\n\nI have one disagreement here: people are getting frustrated already with having to subscribe to multiple services because of exclusives.  Before Disney, this wasn't keyed to a specific studios, it was a collection of different studios.   Right now, with multiple studios per service,  you still have to subscribe to a minimum of two to three services to get a reasonable coverage, the big ones being Prime, Netflix, and Hulu, all of which cost an extra $10-$13 depending on service selection.\n\nThe key to being successful at the streaming platform is that it's cheaper and more accessible than cable.  Now add a new streaming service for every studio, presume each will charge roughly $8 down the line, and you're paying at least $48 a month, that's in the hopes that the sub-studios don't jump on the bandwagon.  Then you have 6 TV studios in the US (god forbid you want UK programs); lets say they're less ambitious and go for $5 a month, so pump that up by another $30 to get them all.\n\nI just see this as a trend that will kill streaming as a feature; to be successful it really needs a middle person like a studio-collaborative version of Netflix, perhaps pay $10 a month for old movies and add a dollar for each studio for current releases.

With a digital return to the past, I'm expecting torrenting to increase again.
