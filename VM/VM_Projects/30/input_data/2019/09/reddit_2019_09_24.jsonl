I'll likely re-initiate a NFLX position this week, especially on any bounce.\n\nIWM: The rolling I did here was more short term. I'll play index products by buying a longer-dated option and then selling shorter-dated calls against it. In this case, I have JAN IWM 156 puts, and had sold some SEP 27 154 puts. I rolled those out to next week and down to the 153 strike, collecting more premium and giving me more room to profit to the downside.\n\nThe AMZN spread was a delta adjustment. At the beginning of the day I was leaning shorter than my beta-weighted portfolio delta told me I should. That trade was my biggest loser, but a mix of wins and losses is to be expected with a diversified portfolio. Overall I was up over 3 percent on the day.\n\nKMX was an earnings trade.
