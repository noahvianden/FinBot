{"title": "Bullish on Restaurant Brands International (QSR)", "selftext": "Thought I’d post some Saturday DD for all you autists to lead into next trading week.\n\nRestaurant Brands International is the parent holding company of Tim Hortons, Burger King, and Popeyes Chicken. I’m extremely bullish on this company as they’ve made some huge moves lately that I don’t think people realize how massive these moves are. The company slightly missed earnings on its Tim Hortons brand last quarter due to bad weather in Canada, but that doesn’t worry me at all because Tim Hortons is a symbol up here for people and is always innovating new menu trends and items. Here’s some of the reasons I believe the company will take off in the next 10 years:\n\n1. Expansion: RBI is expanding into China with 1,500 Tim Hortons stores in the next decade and if they can tap into that market and take some market share from Starbucks it’ll be huge. Also just announced this week is that they’re expanding from 26,000 total stores of the 3 brands to 40,000 in the next decade as well. They’re planning to expand to emerging markets such as Brazil and there’s a 5-6% projected growth rate for the burger and chicken markets in the next 5 years. Since 2010, RBI has gone from 10,000 franchises to 26,000 today and overall sales have gone from 15B to 32B in those 9 years. Jose Cil, the CEO, is a former President of Burger King and has lots of experience in the the fast food industry.\n\n2. Innovation: This is the one I’m most excited about. Burger King will be offering Impossible Burgers in every location in the US by the end of 2019, made by Impossible Meats, a direct competitor to Beyond Meat which IPO’d a few weeks ago. Tim Hortons just started offering Beyond Meat sausage products in select stores last week as a product test to see how they will do and I’m very confident these products will make it into every Tim Hortons store moving forward and open up a whole new revenue line for their business. Burger King also just recently started doing a coffee subscription business to take away from McDonald’s share of the breakfast segment, offering a $5/month subscription service for a small coffee every morning (30 coffees for $5). Burger King is also doing renovations to their existing facilities to bring them up to speed beside McDonald’s with self-serve kiosks, more modern looks, etc.\n\n3. Non-Cyclical Business Segment: We all know the market is very volatile right now with the tariff war and a trade deal uncertain. These restaurants operate in a non-cyclical matter and still perform well under economic recessions and thriving markets alike. Consumer discretionary spending goes down obviously during a recession but other than that there isn’t any other super big risks associated with these companies that would hurt them long-term besides something such as not keeping up with trends (healthier trends, alternative meat, etc.) but they are already ahead of the curve and bringing these innovations to market. Another thing that could potentially affect the company is if minimum wage increases in the US, as the company employs mostly minimum wage workers in its franchises. As far as the next 10 years goes I believe they’ll continue to adapt to consumer demands and be  innovating their brands to stay competitive both domestically and internationally. They’re poised for extensive growth and I think they have a strong CEO who has a clear path for success with the company and the experience to make them into one of the largest restaurant brands in the world.", "id": "bq7dbb", "created_utc": 1558205371.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "I would not touch this stock it's near all time highs due to bynd meats ipo traffic \n\n\nBynd meats will fall hard after earnings \n\n5.2 billion market cap\n\nGet the fuck out my face", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "It's hard to trust your analysis when you don't even know the name of the company you're knocking.\n\nCare to share your thoughts on Amazons or Apples?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Kid I have a 6 figure portflio and been trading for 10 years.\nHave made profit all of them.\n\nU know how u get real gains \n\nFeeling the emotions of the market.\n\nNot being good at math or have a masters in finance or engineering.\n\n\nWhy?\nCause the market has no logic hahah", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Cool story man, I was criticizing you because the company is called Beyond Meat, not Beyond Meats.
