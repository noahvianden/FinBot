{"title": "Let's discuss Telaria", "selftext": "Hey gang, some hopefully helpful DD here on what I believe it a 3-4 bagger down the road.\n\nThe company is Telaria, a \"sell side\" digital advertising company that can produce, in-house, digital video content for multitudes of platforms. One of their largest contract is with Hulu, and they also have contracts with 5 out of the 7 largest digital advertising firms, or firms on the \"buy side\" of advertising.\n\n**BACKGROUND**\n\nIn 2017, then-Tremor Video (now Telaria) was both in the buy and sell side of the business, but didn't really do both of them well. In late 2017, they decided to abandon the buy side, and focus solely on content generation for the sell side, and re-branded as Telaria. They do this through technoogy and service partners searching out premium video content.The name for their company, according to their website, is **\"a derivation of the Greek word Talaria, which is the name of the winged sandals worn by Hermes, the messenger of the gods. We use this spelling because our core focus has always been video ‚Äì from the smallest mobile screens to the largest televisions.\"**\n\n**FUNDAMENTALS**\n\nTicker Symbol: $TLRA  \nCurrent Stock Price: $8.32  \nMarket Cap: $365 million  \n52 week MA: 102.43%  \nGlassdoor Review: 4.5/5 stars (100% approval of CEO)\n\n**IN THE WEEDS**\n\nPiecing some of this together from their recent quarterly report news coverage, but from 18Q1 to 19Q1, revenue increased 42% to 13.6 million. This is also an increase in 31% from Q4. Analysts were only expecting a 23% rise from Q4.\n\nWhat's driving the huge increases? Connected TV (or CTV). Year over year, Telaria saw a whopping 169% increase in revenue from connected TV advertising. At the beginning of 2019, Telaria locked in a contract with Hulu. CTV now accounts for 38% of the company's total revenue.\n\nJust as important is guidance. Management raised its guidance for the full year, guiding for revenue between $66 million and $70 million and adjusted EBITDA between $2 million and $5 million. Prior to raised guidance, management expected 2019 revenue between $63 million and $67 million and adjusted EBITDA between $1 million and $4 million.\n\n**BEHIND THE SCENES**\n\nNow, why is it important to differentiate between buy and sell side. The buy side of advertising is already riddled with many competitiors, and some are larger than others. However, the \"harder\" part (my emphasis) is on the sell side. The sell side is charged with putting together the content that not only does what the advertiser/client wants, but that is also acceptable to the platform (see: Hulu/Roku) in what they would  WANT its content consumers to take in. Furthermore, the sell side is less dominated by larger players in the digital video advertising space, so this gives Telaria a moat for the future.\n\n**THE FUTURE**\n\nUmmm, are any of us expecting a return to the ABC/NBC/CBS dominated world? Even 24-cable news is losing its luster for streaming \"connected\" TV. So, you want players who can do this job well and can have a notable ROI for advertisers. And with more and more streaming platforms either established or coming on line (Hulu, Disney+, Fire TV, Netflix, Tubi TV, etc...) the need for experts and winners in this field will grow. Telaria seems to be setting itself up for future success.\n\nAdditionally, for a company like this to abandon its previous business model, turn around, and accelerate like this in less than 24 months -- damn impressive.\n\nIn my opinion, easily a future $1 billion company.", "id": "bnfd9i", "created_utc": 1557599767.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "Good read thank you", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "NP Fam", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I might grab a few OCT Calls on Monday", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Might recommend waiting until we get through May ...
