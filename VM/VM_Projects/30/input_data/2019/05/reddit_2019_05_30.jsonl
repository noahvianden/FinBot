{"title": "Tesla And Real World Reinforcement Learning At Scale", "selftext": "", "id": "bupg9b", "created_utc": 1559194765.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "Main points:\n\n* If Tesla can develop full autonomy and launch autonomous taxis at large scale within the next few years, almost all existing valuation models will be out the window. It's worth paying attention to. ARK Invest's autonomous taxi valuation model puts a $6,000 price target on Tesla based on 5 million autonomous taxis. That price target seems reasonable _if_ Tesla can deploy 5 million autonomous taxis. Even if ARK's financial modelling for this scenario is 50% off, $3,000 is still huge and vastly more than anyone (including ARK) is modelling for Tesla based on auto sales. Most analyst firms seem to be in agreement that autonomous taxis will be a big market if they can actually launch at scale. \n\n* To understand why this is worth paying attention to, we need to understand why Tesla is unique among companies working on autonomy. Waymo's fleet has experienced less than 500 years of collective driving. OpenAI Five trained on 45,000 years of Dota, and I believe DeepMind trained AlphaStar on 60,000 years of StarCraft. To get to 10,000 years of experience, Waymo would need to drive a fleet of 1,000 vehicles 12 hours a day for 20 years. By contrast, Tesla's HW2/HW3 fleet is currently driving at an annualized rate of 18,000 years per year. Tesla has a unique opportunity here to try reinforcement learning at the sort of scale we know works in some domains. \n\n* Shadow mode is a potential way to train and test an imitation learning agent and/or a reinforcement learning agent. Run the IL/RL agent passively on the fleet, and then upload a replay log anytime there is a disagreement between the IL/RL agent and the human driver. When disagreements are very low, that suggests the IL/RL agent has learned to drive like a human. Once deployed, disengagements and possibly other sources of reward signal can train the RL agent to drive better. \n\n* Neural networks are brittle, so novelty is a problem for them. The rate of novel situations over thousands and millions of miles of driving is an open, empirical question that will — in part — determine the fate of autonomous cars. Too high a rate, and neural networks will not know what to do too often for autonomous cars to be safe, convenient, and practical. But if the rate is low enough, then imitation learning and reinforcement learning may be able to master the long tail of rare situations.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "NN's are brittle?

I like the comparison to DOTA and Starcraft AIs.   Driving is a strategy game in a lot of ways.  With minor adjustments made along the way as human behavior changes the environment.  It seems highly applicable to compare the learning environments.  \n\nTesla's enormous data advantage should be a bigger talking point than it is.  Is it just because it is over most people's heads?  Do they have some legitimate reason for doubting the data's effectiveness?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> Tesla's enormous data advantage should be a bigger talking point than it is. Is it just because it is over most people's heads? Do they have some legitimate reason for doubting the data's effectiveness?\n\nThe biggest issue is most of the data isn't that useful.  Most of it is people driving on highways in California.  A lot of the real \"learning\" for the computer is done by taking edge cases, plugging them into a simulation, and running thousands of variations of that simulation.  Actual edge cases don't happen enough in the real world.  \n\nJust out of curiosity, why do you feel confident to judge Tesla's approach to being superior and assuming other people just don't understand it?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe only ~0.01% of the seconds spent driving actually contain useful information.

The computer in a vehicle doesn't \"know\" it is in the real world or a simulation - it just responds to the information provided to it via its sensors (or via another computer program, though the data looks exactly the same).  The simulations being run are designed to be difficult scenarios for the computer to deal with, that is the whole point.  Waymo isn't making it easy, they are putting their computer through the worst possible scenarios (which you can't run in the real world for safety reasons), and the computer is reacting exactly the same as if it was happening for real, since from its \"perspective\" there is no difference.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Sure, I'm not saying that the computer will react differently for simulation vs real life. I'm sure they can spoof the inputs so that it reacts the same. There is value to doing this for unsafe conditions as you said.

Like, if one is bad isn't the other doubly or even triply bad?  I drive a Model 3 in a neighborhood with at least 3 others, and we are all in the city limits of a different state every day of the week.  When I drive out of my neighborhood I see dozens of Teslas on the road.  I can tell you for sure that I see far more HW2 Teslas on the road than Waymos. So, while the \"mostly\" statement may be true, its obvious they have plenty of data to pull from other sources than California highways.  At the very least they have far more than Waymo.\n\nAlso, what is the source for \"most of the data is useless\"?  If you have it, what % I'm curious?  I'm not challenging the statement, but I hear that parroted a lot and it doesn't necessarily stand to reason.  Maybe there is something I'm missing but it seems you're far more likely to run into edge cases when you have expanded driving areas and conditions of all sorts compared to geofenced miles.  Is there some factor from LIDAR technology or those specific areas that I'm not accounting for?  \n\nAs an illustration let's think of it this way- if Tesla has 100,000 miles of data, but only 20% of it is useful, that's still double the next closest competitor at 10,000 miles.  \n\nInterested to hear your thoughts as I'm open to being wrong.\n\nEdit: BTW I did not downvote you.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not saying having more data isn't better, my point is there are diminishing returns to how many real world miles of data you have.  A computer doesn't need real world data to learn behavior.  \n\nTo use your example, lets say Tesla has 100k miles of data, but only 20% is useful, while Waymo has only 10k miles of data, of which only 2k is useful.  Waymo is then taking that 2k of useful miles, changing variables, and running 10 million miles of driving in simulations every day of those edge cases to train its computers.  The amount of real world data you have becomes almost trivial assuming you wind up simulating a sufficient universe of edge cases.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "But.... that's ... exactly what Tesla is doing, too.

Real world data is important, but there just isn't enough of it to train a computer.  How often does a train de-rail in a town?

And much faster. However, the validity of training in simulation is directly related to the similarity of that simulation with what happens in the real world.\n\nBut in order to make a 'messy' simulation, you need to anticipate the messiness that happens in the real world. You have to know that a train de-railing is a thing that could happen in front of a car. What about a moose moving traffic cones in a construction zone? Would you have anticipated and programmed in that obstacle? A simulation is bounded by what you can anticipate and program, and you can't anticipate everything that could happen.\n\nI guarantee that as Telsa reviews their edge cases they come across many weird messy cases that they never could have anticipated. I'm not saying Google isn't doing the same thing, but that Tesla can encounter weird situations more often that google can dream them up.\n\nAdditionally, with any given 'weird' case, it is much easier to change the model to react to the weird environment, than to anticipate the weird environment, generate the weird environment, generate 1000 slightly different variations as you said, and change the model to react to the new environment.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I don't think we are really disagreeing much to be honest.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "At first I was skeptical about what you were implying but I see your argument.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for posting and sharing.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The question is really whether Waymo's simulated world is really sufficiently detailed and covers a broad enough range of actual edge cases.
