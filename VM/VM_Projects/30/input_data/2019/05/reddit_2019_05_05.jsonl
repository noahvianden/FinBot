I expect some big decreases in positions within FXI, BABA, NVDA etc. but curious as to how this type of news will affect volatility. Thank you!\n\nEdit: Iâ€™m looking at a 5-10% increase tomorrow, but also wondering how the increase will play out over the week and if it will consolidate back to normal levels.

Leads to me thinking that volatility spike to be most pronounced early tomorrow and then again (either upwards or downwards depending on the solutions) on Wednesday / later in the week when the meetings information is released. This is just another catalyst knocking China stocks down a bit more. Might look into some underpriced companies / ETFâ€™s to go long on with longer-term positions Tuesday before the meeting Wednesday. I assume Trump wonâ€™t want to cause issues long-term with China and as you said, get some leverage at the talks. Without the Fed taking action for a bit we are entering a relatively stable growth period until a major catalyst skews things.
