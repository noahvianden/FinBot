{"title": "up and out on covered calls", "selftext": " \n\nHello, I have been writing covered calls for a few months now against a stock portfolio I already own and like. I was speaking with a financial planner guy who said that the strategy is fine, but the potential the strategy has to have you 'sit out' big market runs doesn't pay off in the long time.\n\nUsing an example, I guess his idea is this. If I want to own AMZN for a long time but like writing options about it, he seems to be suggesting that if I write an option at 1800 when we are at 1700 -- and then stock goes to 1900 .. I missed the stretch from 1800 to 1900.\n\nBut it seems to me if you utilize the strategy to go \"up and out\" you can avoid this every time. So, if on the day of expiration (or day before) and it looks like my option will get assigned (which i want to avoid), I just roll the option out a few weeks and take the strike up .. most likely generating another good premium in the process.\n\nSo, I think avoiding assignments is not only possible, but often translates to a new premium-making opportunity anyway.\n\nIs this right?", "id": "bxfipj", "created_utc": 1559819748.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "> So, if on the day of expiration (or day before) and it looks like my option will get assigned\n\nWhat happens if you get assigned before expiration?

{"title": "BYND Earnings AMC and Borrow Rate", "selftext": "**Edit:  I changed my mind. They should crush revenue estimates. Here is why-** In their S1, they guide to $38-40m for their 1Q19 sales and a gross margin of 25-26.3%. Analyst estimates are for the same $38-40m. Unless they are the fucking stupidest management team in the history of fake-meat, they should **crush** estimates. The key to a successful IPO is to have your company guide low for the first quarter out of the gate, so that your company can beat expectations and stay in the spotlight for longer. And considering they had GS as their lead left book runner on the IPO, I'm guessing they were advised how important it is to crush your first earnings report out of the gate... let's see if I'm right. I own August calls in case I am wrong and need the time value to sell. Another thing to consider are the whisper #'s- which I have no insight into. Hopefully they are also low. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOriginal Post: I have zero clue how they'll do. I hope well, but I have no insight. Some things which may positively impact earnings: Impossible Burger (their main competitor) had a product recall according to Pat LaFrieda, so that might help. Some people reported seeing vendors sell out of Beyond Meat, but none of the ones near me were sold out... Some things which may impact negatively: Some people reported that BYND had trouble meeting demand as their supplies were low. Again: I have NO CLUE if that is true, but it those are some of the factors that may impact the results. If supplies truly ran out, it may cause expenses to shoot up as they have to pay rush delivery to meet demand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Estimates**\n\nRevenue: Avg estimate is $39m with a range of $38-40m based on 8 analysts (seeking alpha is my source). Does anyone have a better source? I'd love to see it, if they do!\n\nEPS: $(0.15) with a spread of ($0.18)-($0.12)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot sure if they'll provide revenue guidance but avg of 2Q19 estimates is $48.3m and avg of FY2019 estimates is $204.9m, up 133% y/y.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Updated Borrow Rate from Today:** I have seen borrow rates of 111%, but new borrow rates that S3 is quoting is 97% on existing shorts and 130-160% for new shorts. 51% of the float is short. According to S3: \"There is virtually no lendable stock left to borrow, any downward price moves in the future will be due to long selling.\"\n\nSo arguably this quarter's earnings and guidance (if they provide guidance) are going to be more important than normal as this will likely be the only negative catalyst, if they miss, for the next 3 months.
