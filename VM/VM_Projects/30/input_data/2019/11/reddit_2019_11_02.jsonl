{"title": "Some interesting news in the stock market this week", "selftext": "Lots of news this week with earnings season in full swing as well as a few other controversial developments. I am going to start with the large caps before moving on to smaller companies and have tried to categorize them as much as possible for those who prefer to dip in and out. \n\nStarting with the big caps, **Alphabet** reported strong Q3 earnings on Tuesday before proceeding to buy Fitbit on Friday for $2.1 billion (70% above the pre-rumour price). The earnings report however got a more negative reception due to losses on equity holdings (probably Uber) impacting Alphabet’s net profitability by almost $3 billion. Excluding these items revenues were up 20% and core earnings up 17% resulting in an encouraging continuation of the strong growth reported in Q2. The stock closed on Friday with an attractive trailing PE of 27.33 (or 23.9 when adjusted for net cash of $144 million).\n\nThere was some good news for **Johnson & Johnson** on Tuesday as they reported that independent testing had confirmed that there was no asbestos in the Baby Powder that had been recalled after the FDA reported that trace amounts had been found. It was good news for J&J but the FDA was unconvinced and stood by its findings. \n\n**Beyond Meat** reported strong results after the bell on Monday with sales up 250%. However the stock price dropped sharply on Tuesday (20%) after a wave of selling followed the end of the lockup period as shareholders holding 80% of outstanding shares were allowed, for the first time, to sell and lock in some profits.\n\nOn Wednesday **Twitter** announced it would ban all political advertising in a move that will probably heap pressure on **Facebook** to do the same. Whilst a newsworthy story it is unlikely to have a big impact on either company with Facebook potentially losing out on 0.5% of revenues next year and Twitter even less. However it should have a more positive impact for local television and radio stations who will benefit as political advertisements switch to traditional media (if anyone knows a good local media stock please let me know).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Growth stocks (Purple Innovation, Universal Display and Teladoc)** \n\nOn Thursday the mattress manufacturer Tempur Sealy jumped 11% after revenues increase 3% and earnings 15% but in my opinion it is Tempurs rival and mattress industry disruptor **Purple Innovation** that would make a much better investment.\n\nTempur's stock price has doubled this year and is valued at almost 2x revenues and 30x earnings which seems generous for a stock operating in a slow growing and cyclical industry.  However industry disrupter Purple Innovation is growing rapidly through direct online mattress sales and is priced on just 1x sales and 25x current year estimates (15x next years).\n\nPurple is the second biggest “bed in a box” company, after Casper, and was founded by Utah based scientist entrepreneurs Tony and Terry Pearse after they developed and patented Hypo Elastic Polymer (HEP).  HEP is reportedly \"bouncy, responsive, and soft\" and more like a gel than foam (for those that need more explanation see link at bottom “myslumberyard”).\n\nThis benefit has not been missed by customers and Q2 revenues reported in August were up 36%, margins were up and guidance was raised significantly with revenue of $400 million to $425 million (from $350 million to $375 million) and EBITDA of $24 million to $27 million (from $3 million to $8 million) .\n\nCEO Joe Megibow said \"I am confident that we are well positioned to profitably capitalize on the numerous growth opportunities we believe exist for the Company in the near and long-term.\"\n\nThe internet combined with the ability to ship a quality mattress anywhere in the country inexpensively has disrupted the whole mattress industry. Purple Innovation has grown quickly and executed well since it was listed in February 2018 but this has not been reflected in the stock price.\n\nThe company is expected to report profitability for the first time this year. This should be a good catalyst to drive the stock to a higher multiple. Economies of scale and the opportunity to win share in a huge market offer great potential.\n\n**Universal Display**’s stock price jumped 15% after strong results on Wednesday. The stock already had an eye wateringly high valuation but the opportunity for growth from OLED televisions is truly remarkable and, in my opinion, the optimism is justified.\n\nUniversal Display owns more than 5,000 organic light emitting diode (OLED) patents that generate royalties from OLED manufacturers based on smart phone screen area manufactured. That screen area is increasing rapidly. The smart phone sector still has some growth left in it but the real opportunity is OLED televisions (with each 60 inch tv equating to almost 100 smart phones) which are expected to drive 150% growth over the next four years.\n\nNow assuming Universal Display's revenues increase by 150% and its net margin increases from 33% (yes 33% is correct) to 40%, then earnings of $400 million on a PE of 24 would just about pretty much justify the current valuation. That doesn’t offer much of a cushion for investors wanting to buy in unless there are significant opportunities for growth beyond five years.\n\nWell there are significant opportunities.  OLEDs are the most efficient way to turn electricity into light. They are flexible and can be produced in any shape and are capable of producing a softer more pleasant ambient lighting. Televisions have a long run way of growth ahead of them but lighting has not even gotten started. According to a report last year from ResearchAndMarkets, sales of OLED lighting products are set to grow at 50% p.a. to $1.4 billion by 2022. And even that's only scratching the surface. Sales are expected to increase a further fourfold by 2027.\n\nFor me Universal Display's valuation is eye watering. It is a growth stock priced for perfection and will fall sharply with any set back. However the opportunity is huge and, with Universal Display owning the intellectual property, so is the potential upside.\n\n**Teladoc’s** stock increased 14% after reporting 24% revenue growth on Wednesday but the company faces many competitors and Amazon has already dipped its toe into remote medical services.\n\nTeledoc uses telephone and videoconferencing technology to provide on-demand remote medical services. This is a large industry (estimated at $20bn) and growing quickly (estimated at 17% p.a.). Teladoc, with a market cap $5.5bn, is currently the best known and largest player in the sector. \n\nHowever, in my opinion, growth of 24% is not sufficient to support a valuation of 10x revenues unless the company has a significant competitive moat and clear runway to market dominance. Teladoc does not have that. There are plenty of competitors (even if none of them are listed) who are willing to offer cheaper pricing in order to chip away at Teladoc’s market share.  More worrying is that Teladoc’s 70% gross profit margins have caught the eye of Amazon who announced the launch of Amazon Care in September. That scheme is initially being tested on a small number of Amazon employees but it is almost certain to grow and become a competitor for Teladoc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Value stocks (Royal Carribean and Hanesbrands)**\n\n**Royal Caribbean** dropped on Wednesday after reporting its best Q3 ever. The company missed expectations by a few cents but still managed to increase earnings by 9% compared to last year. A remarkable achievement given Hurricane Dorian “the most disruptive storm in the company’s history” knocked 13 cents off the total.  The company issued 2019 guidance with EPS of $9.50-9.55 meaning the stock ($111.15 at Friday’s close) is only trading on 11.7x current year guidance. Additionally, in an encouraging article reported by Barron’s, Royal Caribbean’s CEO said that he expects a \"very robust 2020\"\n\n**Hanesbrands** also dropped after reporting good results but managed to recover most of those losses by Friday. Constant currency sales were up 2%, earnings increased 4% and full year guidance for sales and earnings were increased to show similar growth.  Sales at Hanesbrands’ increasingly popular retro brand Champion increased by 25% which was less than 50% last quarter but still very encouraging. \n\nHowever, even after the stocks recovery, the trailing PE for Hanesbrands was just 9.68 at Fridays close. In my opinion the market is missing the bigger picture. Hanesbrands is a stable company with its Champion brand enjoying a retro revival. According to a Bloomberg report in April, teenage boys rank Champion among their 15 favorite brands alongside designers Gucci and Tommy Hilfiger. Such a brand surely is worthy of a much better multiple -- perhaps even 15x.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Great company but too pricey (Moody’s)**\n\n**Moody’s Corporation** reported a beat and raise on Wednesday with revenues up 15%, earnings up 27% and FY 2019 guidance increased from adjusted EPS $8.05 to $8.125 at the midpoint ($7.39 last year).\n\nMoody's is an attractive business. The largest player by a margin in the duopoly/oligopoly that is the credit rating business. Regulatory requirements are increasing, long term bond issuance is increasing (even if short term down turns continue) and investors demand either a Moody's or S&P rating (preferably Moody's).  That makes it nearly impossible for new entrants.\n\nDuring the Great Recession (which caused no shortage of criticism of the rating agencies) revenues only fell briefly in 2007 before beginning their relentless march upwards again.\n\nHowever, a lot of this good news is now priced in. The stock is up 70% from year lows and, valued at 27.1x current year estimates, it is no longer the bargain it was.\n\nIn short I think Moody’s is a great company and a long term hold. But I'm going to wait for the next market wobble. I don't think that wobble will be anything as bad as 2007 but, nevertheless, I think I'll be able to pick up Moody’s stock a lot cheaper.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Speculative and high risk (Sprint and Tupperware Brands)**\n\n**Sprint Corporation,** the communications company, announced last week that it will report earnings on November 4th. However for most investors the results are irrelevant and it is the prospect of a merger with T-Mobile that will ultimately decide the value of Sprint’s stock. \n\nThere are a number of commentators (such as Boost Mobile founder Peter Adderton) saying that Sprint Corporation is going to zero if the planned merger with T-Mobile doesn’t get approved.  On the other hand, with Justice Department approval now in place, significant progress has been made and the primary issue remaining is the multi-state anti-trust lawsuit planned to start on December 9th.  Furthermore, former FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell seems to believe strongly that this attempt to block the deal will fail (see Bloomberg link at bottom of post).\n\nSo what are the potential payoffs?  Under the current offer you need 9.75 Sprint stocks to get 1 T-Mobile stock if the merger is approved.  At yesterday’s close you would need $61.43 worth of Sprint stock to swap for $82.47 of T-Mobile stock. That represents a potential upside of 34.3%. However, if the deal fails we are assuming, like Mr Adderton, that you get zero.  On that basis, the implied probability of success of the merger is 43%.\n\nThose who believe that the odds of success are higher, like Mr McDowell seems to, may wish to buy in. But they should understand that they could lose the entire stake if the deal falls through.\n\n**Tupperware Brands** fell sharply on Wednesday after reporting a bad miss. Revenues fell 14% and EPS of $0.43 missed expectations by a whopping 19 cents. But with the stock down 40% this week to $9.71 (and down 85% from 2017 highs) it looks like it may now offer a (risky) opportunity.\n\nTupperware’s balance sheet looks okay and the lowered guidance of $1.95 (adjusted $2.80) would still be a good result for the company if it manages to deliver.  Even if we assume a worse deterioration with earnings halved to $1.60 the stock still looks reasonably priced.\n\nThe problem is challenging headwinds from economic and political concerns to declining relevance. The steps that management have taken to turn the company around don't seem to have worked. Worryingly there has been almost no indication of improvement.\n\nHowever that is usually the best time to get in to a speculative opportunity.  The potential upside here is that a positive quarter or two could see the stock rise 200% approaching $30 if not higher. The downside is the stock could fall to zero. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Disaster of the week (Grubhub)**\n\n**Grubhub** dropped 43% on Tuesday after guidance for flat revenues proved that any idea that the company possessed powerful double-sided network effects with restaurants and diners was incorrect.  It is a bleak assessment for the industry as a whole but hit Grubhub particularly hard given its high expectations.  In short, network effects appear to be only local and that’s why competitors like DoorDash, Uber Eats, Caviar, and Postmates have been able to carve out market share. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease feel free to “FOLLOW” me if you would like to see my regular updates during the week.\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy or sell. Stocks are risky and not suitable for everybody.
