I don’t think lowering interest rates is going to help all that much because investment isn’t that sensitive at these low interest rates.”**\n>\nThe only thing that might help, Graham said, is resolving the questions surrounding tariffs. But that will probably be countered by the coming uncertainty of the 2020 presidential election...............", "id": "eegz6i", "created_utc": 1577083664.0, "score": 119, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "“oh yeah CFO’s are such good predictors of recession. they saw 08 coming and every single recession before that” said no one ever!", "score": 119, "replies": [{"body": "Well if you keep saying it'll happen soon eventually you'll be right..", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "In other words, even a broken clock is right twice a day.", "score": 19, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "What an idiot.

Your mother’s egg must have been fertilized with piss instead of semen, so let me help you out:\nAfter the tech bubble of the early 2000’s, the central bank lowered rates and created a housing bubble. That in itself can deflate without creating a systemic crisis but because of lax lending guidelines from mortgage companies and securitisation by banks we created a monster that could only sink the whole system when housing prices came down. \nYou think Lehman’s CFO saw it coming, their CEO maybe? maybe in your alternate reality but not in this one Dumdum.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Aw this is great! I've been waiting all day for an idiotic response like this, absolving the government of any blame for the housing crisis. Sit down kiddo lemme tell you some facts!\n\nFirst of all, let me recommend the Big Short. It's a great way to learn more about the Housing Crisis, and you don't even have to do any reading! So that should be perfect for you. TLDR the big finding at the end is that the government was at fault because they knew about it and did nothing!\n\nMore importantly, you should know that the government wasn't doing shit when it came to overseeing risk. No one verified income levels, job descriptions, equity/asset levels, nothing. No oversight on bond ratings either. Moody's, S&P and the rest gave bull shit ratings and the government knew but didn't do shit. So what happens when people overleverage their mortgages? What happens when people buy bullshit bonds? The economy goes under. End of story. Don't give me that tech bubble nonsense because you and I both know that wasn't the main cause of what happened in 2008. \n\nAnd lastly. Don't shit on CFOs. They do so much more than you think. These guys are smarter than the CEOs in most cases, which is why many of them go on to become CEOs. They have tons of feelers out in the economy to get a sense of trends and they implement them quick. You think companies are made overnight? You think companies beat quarter after quarter on luck? You think companies can predict annual EPS and be accurate down to the penny based on sheer guess??? Wake up kid. There's someone behind the scenes making sure all of that happens.
