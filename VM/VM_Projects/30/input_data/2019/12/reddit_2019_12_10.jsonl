{"title": "$ROAD Construction Partners, another monster rally in the making", "selftext": "***$ROAD: Construction Partners***\n\n***Price: $16.02***   \n***Number of shares float: 18,480,000!!!***   \n***Number of shares short: 600 000***   \n***% of shares short: 3%***   \n***Days to cover: 2.2***   \n***Latest earnings (EPS and REV miss): EPS of 0.32 misses by 0.02.  Rev of 237.32M misses by 13.15M.***   \n***Guidance (RAISE): FY2020 Rev 830-870M vs consensus 795.62M.***    \n***Latest upgrade: Baird PT raise from $16 to $20***   \n***Market cap: $514M***   \n***PE: 19.58***   \n***Price range (52W): $7.70 - $20.79***   \n   \nToday, trading down 22% at $16.02 as of this posting.  I'm personally in 3000 shares at 15.72 on the crazy dip.  I have firepower capital to purchase another 5000 shares on dips.\n\nLets face it, road construction isn't going under anytime soon.  As the economy develops, so will infrastructure.  $ROAD is pretty much a monopoly in the states it operates it.  It has significant deferred revenue (since government contracts take a shit long time to pay out) which means future capital will come in fast and huge.  It sits on a potential goldmine of landmark revenue due to continued investments into the domestic economy by Trump.  It has nearly 0 debt, cash on hand, and actually turns a profit.  It is quickly expanding in the USA with recent acquisitions of \nasphault firms further cementing (that's a PUN) its foothold into the road construction monopoly in the states.\n\nToday's trading range was from 15.53 to 18.74 which is a HUGE range.  I got in on the lower end of the range (and it still looks to be on the lower end of the range).  I see this trading back to around its upper range 18.74 in 1-2 weeks easily.  It's currently trading hugely down today due to overreaction (and profit taking) from its missed earnings (which wasn't as bad as it looks if you read into the financials).\n\nIf you followed my previous DD suggestion on $SCVL, you'd have made over 10% and banked huge gains on that (I'm still holding that FYI).  So listen to me again you autists, stop playing with turd shit like $PTON, $ROKU, $TSLA.\n\n***UPDATE 1 (12/10):*** The bounce from its lows of 15.53 to its current price of 16.43 (as of this update) is a testament.  BELIEVE.\n\n***UPDATE 2 (12/10):*** Caught another dip of 1000 shares at 16.38 just now.  New average is 4000 shares @ 15.88.\n\n***UPDATE 3 (12/10):*** Another dip buy here of 1000 shares at 16.25.  New average is 5000 shares @ 15.97.\n\n***UPDATE 4 (12/10):*** Looks like some noobs are buying at the ask which is driving it up a bit here.  I expect a pullback because of these noobs buying at the ask.  A close above 17 would be mighty bullish for tomorrow.\n\n\n***UPDATE 5 (12/11):*** Price target raised to 18.50 by Imperial Capital.  Possible gap up.\n\n***UPDATE 6 (12/11):*** It gapped up here.  I personally would not re-enter here as I'm expecting a pullback to high 16's.  If it doesn't pullback, don't FOMO, there's always other tickers.\n\n***UPDATE 7 (12/12):*** That pullback to high 16's happened.  Yep.  Hope you autists listened to me.  Or are you still losing money on crap like $CRWD, $PTON, $ROKU, $BYND?\n\n***UPDATE 8 (12/16):*** The pullback to high 16's on (12/12) was the entry to get in.  Now it's breakaway to 18's but will consolidate (range bound) this week a bit.\n\n***UPDATE 9 (12/17):*** Nice little bump today.  Though still in consolidation phase so will be range bound from low 17's to high 17's for a few days until breakaway to 18.50ish.\n\n***UPDATE 10 (12/18):*** Still rangebound, tiny bump up today.\n\n***UPDATE 11 (12/19):*** As expected, still rangebound.", "id": "e8uv8x", "created_utc": 1576004069.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "I’m in for 3 shares", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "this could be big", "score": 13, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Arent their past contracts already priced in for a future increase in capital?\n\nDo you think there will be further growth internationally?\n\nIm sitting on this one for now.
