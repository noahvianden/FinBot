{"title": "To anyone with advanced pro forma modeling skills, please help a level 99 retard out with TSLA valuation.", "selftext": "TLDR: \n\nFinancial Modeling valuation project on Tesla; I'm retarded; Dean of Business School watching presentations.  This is not a meme\n\nQuick backstory. For my financial modeling class, my retarded ass decided to do my final valuation project on Tesla.  My  professor ACTUALLY LET ME DO IT either out of equal retardation or a desire to see the suffering she knew I'd go through.  If you're not sure why this is a problem, Tesla has high historical growth rates across the board and a lot of negative numbers being that it's still so young.\n\nUpon going to another professor, that I see as a mentor, for consultation and telling him my situation he said :\n\n\"Oh, man.  When I teach that class next semester, that's one of the companies that people aren't allowed to pick.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy big dilemma is that I'm using a 5 year annual growth rate of 20% with a wacc of 9%.  My free cash flows are negative given Tesla's financials but with a growth rate>wacc, I'm getting a per share value of \\~$1,000.  I know long term growth rate is supposed to be 2-3% or at least below WACC, but that's only realistic for Tesla like 15 years down the line.  If I push the projection to 10 - 15 years, I gotta adjust the ratios for everything else for it to be realistic.  I've learned more in the past 6 hours than I have all semester and I'm convinced there's no way out of this hole.\n\nI've already made all my justifications for the stock price valuation with future production, plans, new gigafactories etc. but I NEED A FUCKING PRICE THAT MAKES A MODICUM OF SENSE.  To add to this issue, my professor is on medical leave and the dean of our school of business is sitting in for her.  In another class, he called someone out on their numbers being wrong in the middle of their presentation.
