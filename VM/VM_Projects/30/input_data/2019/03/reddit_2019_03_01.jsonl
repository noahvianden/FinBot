I'm talking specifically about bubbles that characterize market cycles and cause the end of the market cycle though, not smaller intra-cycle bubbles.\n\nBut the reason the last 3 cycles ended in severe crashes is directly because of the monetary policy that incentivized malinvestment over safer assets.\n\nYes, for every single year since Bernanke followed his dumbass predecessor's religion, the Fed has caused malinvestment through its short-sighted politically-motivated policies. So far, market sentiment and the slowdowns around the world have kept money in US equities. But when the shoe finally drops, the end of this cycle will be far more severe than it would have been without monetary fuckery.\n\n> But it doesn'tfollow that specific fed actions lead to specific, identifiable bursts of malinvestment. \n\nI disagree with this 100%, because each and every cycle that the Fed has performed this insane rates experiment has ended in a historically severe crash based in a huge sector being built up on malinvestment. Monetary manipulation prevents true price discovery, so when the monetary policy has gone on for several years and inevitably runs out, valuations inevitably crash. And people DO discuss these bubbles while they're happening! The Eurozone sovereign debt bubble, the corporate debt bubble, the pension funds bubble, generally crazy valuations for equities across the board... All these things have been hot topics for years! But simply having valuations high isn't the sole criteria for a crash to actually occur, market sentiment needs to turn and nowadays the market controls the Fed so as long as the Fed is capitulating to small flash-crashes the march will continue upwards. But as soon as the Fed runs out of ammo, the crash will happen and it will dive from a much higher height and hurt more than it would've if we stopped the crazy policies years ago. That's why this is just kicking the can, the crash to end this cycle was baked in as soon as we kept the ZIRP going for more than a couple years, and most of the gains since then have been predicated on having no true price discovery.\n\nAgain, these are simple accounting identities. The whole justification for low rates and easing is to force investors into equities! But the assumption that an artificial shove into equities will result in durable real growth is laughable, the investment options available don't suddenly get less risky just because the Fed is forcing you away from fixed-income.
