Business world as per usual, you snooze you lose.\n\nSince about five years ago, a time when blackberry has cut its phone production from multi billions to zero it has transformed itself into a software IOT company.\n\nNow the numbers:\n\nsoftware grew from 100m/year several years ago to 1000m/year today as it's phone hardware business has gone to 0 from the billions number. That is impressive growth, for it's diversified software business.\n\nBlackberry is a cashflow positive company and has been for many years, so much that it has acquired recently Cylance for \\~1.5 billion dollars in cold hard cash, while still has hundreds of millions of cash left to spend. The company only has a 5 billion market cap valuation.\n\nThe turnaround has completed and growth has began.\n\nBefore the cylance transaction, for a company that has grown from 100m software to 1000m software it was trading at approximately 2-3x rev excluding cash position. Post Cylance it has increased its rate of software growth but now trading at a higher revenue multiple.\n\nRemember, compared to its peers in the software startup industry, not only is blackberry growing at similar rates with cheaper valuation, it is also printing money instead of burning it.\n\nwith the traction in several areas of its business, now seems like a perfect company to park some cash in the security leader.\n\nDavid Tepper would be proud, Blackberry, the Appaloosa of 2019.", "id": "ayrakc", "created_utc": 1552057759.0, "score": 68, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "So all but blackberry calls is what I’m hearing", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Judging by the linked photo, looks like major downsizing in the future.
