{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Wed, Nov 11, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, November 11, 2020**\n\nStocks rose today as tech shares recovered some of their recent declines. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments around a coronavirus vaccine and other treatments. The Nasdaq (QQQ outperformed the market, finishing 2.24% up. The S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.76% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed, finishing 0.1% down.\n\nThis week, so-called reopening stocks, like cruise-lines, airlines, hotels, and brick-and-mortar stores rallied on the backs of Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine announcement. Hopes that drug-makers are closing in on developing and getting approval for a coronavirus vaccine stoked consumer confidence in getting out and traveling. \n\nThe jump in reopening stocks came at the expense of tech stocks that have so far greatly outperformed the broader market throughout the pandemic. This week, the Nasdaq posted back-to-back declines of more than 1% before today while the Dow Jones gained around 4%. Same story in the S&P 500, where financials, industrial, and energy sectors have outperformed tech this week, after greatly lagging year-to-date. Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors said, ‚ÄúInvestors have gotten a lot more comfortable with the election outcome, with progress on COVID-19 solutions, and what again was a very solid earnings season. So I think they‚Äôre looking ahead to 2021 and anticipating, perhaps, much better-than-expected economic growth and earnings growth. And so they‚Äôre pivoting towards more cyclical, value companies and a bit away from the technology.‚Äù\n\nThis week, a number of notable analysts upgraded their near-term expectations for the market. Goldman Sachs (GS) raised their year-end price target for the S&P 500 from 3600 to 3700 and to climb to 4300 by the end of 2021. JP Morgan (JPM) also raised their estimates, placing a price target of 3600 by year-end and 4,000 by early next year, with the potential to then rise further to 4,500 by the end of 2021. JP Morgan analysts said, ‚ÄúAfter a prolonged period of elevated risks (global trade war, COVID-19 pandemic, US election uncertainty, etc.), the outlook is significantly clearing up.‚Äù\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* TikTok's Chinese parent company ByteDance has asked a U.S. appeals court for additional time to work out a potential divestiture of the popular video-sharing app, citing a lack of communication from the Trump administration with a Thursday deadline looming.\n* Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) plan to continue banning political ads on their platforms for the next several weeks to prevent confusion about election results, according to people familiar with the matter and an email reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n* U.S.-listed Chinese electric-vehicle producers -- NIO and Xpeng (XPEV) as well as Li Auto (LI) -- are all about to report third-quarter numbers.

As you get older you will gain much more knowledge of the market and of what makes companies move. For example, you are falsely under the assumption that Microsoft and Sony will have any positive stock movement due to their new consoles. This is a common mistake of new investors who want to think a hot product will drive business. \n\nFirst off, these new consoles and their expected revenue are ‚Äúbaked in‚Äù to the existing stock prices. Secondly, they represent a very small portion of the respective companies revenue stream.  Apple, on the other hand, lives and dies by the iPhone. Yes other parts of their business model generate massive amounts of income but the standard for gauging apple is iPhone success. \n\nFor Microsoft for example, read up on their cloud computing / storage to get a better idea of what is behind their company value and future. \n\nThe same goes for Walmart and Black Friday. Everyone knows Black Friday will be ‚Äúgood‚Äù for Walmart. But it‚Äôs not going to make the company move in any significant way. Rather the stock has benefited from greater online sales due to the pandemic, as has Target. \n\nWhen choosing companies to invest in, try and understand the whole company and where revenue comes from. \n\nLastly, there are going to be red days. And red weeks. And red months. But you have to understand the big picture to see WHY this is happening. Did a stock run up 100% in the last 6 months?
