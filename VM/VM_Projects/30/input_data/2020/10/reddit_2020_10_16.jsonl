{"title": "Buy Nio Stock, Analysts Keep Saying. Why One Calls It 'a Long Term Winner.'", "selftext": "Stock in Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO continued its epic run on Thursday, after another analyst recommended buying the shares.\n\nNIO shares (ticker: NIO) were up 5.9% in afternoon trading. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, for comparison, were near the break-even line.\n\nHong Kong based Citigroup analyst Jeff Chung upgraded shares to the equivalent of Buy from Hold. His price target went to $33.20 from $18.10. Chung upgraded shares after his work suggested NIO sales had picked up in recent weeks.\n\nThe stock rose almost 23% on Wednesday following an upgrade from J.P. Morgan analyst Nick Lai, who wrote that he thinks EV penetration in China is set to quadruple between 2020 and 2025. He called NIO \"a long term winner in the premium space.\" His price target is $40 a share.\n\nLai and Fang aren't alone in their increasing bullishness. NIO stock has been upgraded to Buy four times since June.\n\nHowever, shortly after issuing a Buy recommendation, analyst Fei Fang at Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to Hold and then to Sell. The reason he turned bearish was stock-price appreciation. Shares rose almost 90% while he rated them Buy.\n\nFang was being disciplined about price targets and valuation. Still, NIO stock kept rising after the downgrade to Sell. Shares are up 150% since then and hit a 52-week intraday high on Thursday, trading at $29.30 before settling back down to around $28.\n\nThe stock run has been something to behold. Shares are up almost 600% year to date. But the gains are attracting more Buy recommendations. Roughly 65% of analysts covering the stock rate shares Buy. At the start of the year that number was closer to 15% -- when the stock traded for $4.02.\n\nAll EV stocks have done well in 2020. Stock in Tesla (TSLA), the EV behemoth, for instance, is up 435% year to date, making Elon Musk's company the most valuable auto maker in the world.\n\nAnalysts are having a hard time keeping up with EV stocks such as NIO. Even though a majority recommend the stock, only a couple of price targets are still above where the stock trades now.\n\n**Source: Barron's Article**", "id": "jceq7f", "created_utc": 1602871058.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "“Why One Calls it ‘a Long Term Winner’” \n\nBecause he owns the stock and wants to pump it, I’m guessing.", "score": 45, "replies": [{"body": "This is why I literally never read analysis.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "It's fine to read as long as you know what you're dealing with.

{"title": "What is the truth behind the statement that very few people are able to beat the market?", "selftext": " Because Reddit seems to be good at picking out winners not only in the short term, but in 4-5 year time spans as well… I’ve seen a lot of topics from 2016-2017 where people were bullish on companies like AMD (40x), MSFT (4x), NVDA (20x), TSLA (9x). Some were bullish on failures like GE, and Intel but even if you picked those as well, you still would’ve been up tremendously over the market.\n\nThe stocks that Reddit were hyping 4-5 months ago and are still hyping up today, NET (1.8x), DKNG (2.5x), SQ (3x), ARKK (2x) have also done very well… And it’s not like these are short term stocks either. They all have huge growth opportunities 5-10 years down the line. \n\nIn contrast on average it takes 7 years for an S&P 500 ETF to 2x. Statistically, it would take 7+ years for my investment in VTI to reach the same % gains as the investment I made in DKNG 5 months ago. Furthermore you’d have to wait 20+ years just for VOO and VTI to reach 8x valuations. Most of us would be in our late 40s, or early 50s by then.\n\nAs a young person I’d rather take a medium risk, high reward opportunity, than a very-low risk low-reward opportunity.\n\nAnd yet over and over again, we’re told that very few people are able to beat the market, and you’re better off just dumping everything into an S&P 500 index fund and holding. But the more I lurk on this subreddit and various other investing communities, the more I question that statement.\n\nI’m thinking many people underperform the market because they make emotional decisions. They try to time the market, sell innovative companies for a measly 1.5x gain only to buy back again at a higher price due to fomo, liquidate everything on the slightest hint of bad news and so forth. Just like the statistic that got posted, where the Magellan Fund averaged 20% / year over 10 years, but the people who bought into the fund actually had a net negative.

It doesn't . The S&P 500 index and the DJI are indexes of stocks that are chosen to represent a broad cross-section of the economy to give economists and others an idea of how the economy is doing.

It's true that most funds do not outperform the S&P 500, but they aren't intended to.  People who invest in managed funds are people putting money into retirement accounts and very wealthy people. Fund managers are more concerned about protecting these funds than they are about maximizing growth. The funds that don't beat the S&P 500 are generally not designed to do so. They are designed to be less volatile when the market goes up and down while still outperforming inflation and providing a decent return.\n\nGenerally speaking, you could probably outperform the market, simply by investing in the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 index rather than the whole index or by investing in VOOG or QQQ.  Of course, with a bit of research, you should be able to do even better than that, many years, assuming you are willing to take some risk.\n\nAll that said, many people do not outperform the market, either because they aren't willing to do research and monitor their portfolio, or they simply put their money into managed funds, like targeted date funds (which tend to underperform), and call that good.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "[Morningstar found](https://www.morningstar.com/insights/2019/09/20/active-vs-passive) that only 23% of active funds beat their respective index (not just S&P) over longer periods of time.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The point of a large cap growth portfolio is capital preservation?

Like I said above “the market” isn’t some all powerful, all knowing entity that can’t be defeated, it’s just a broad index. Even in less volatile, more normal markets, you can outperform. You have to display certain characteristics though. You need to do you proper DD and only buy companies with strong balance sheets, wide moats, a product that actually has a use, strong future outlook (as displayed by the company leadership, not reddit hype), either have a history of dividend increase or EPS growth or both, and you’re confident in.

He flips it at the start of each year and if it's heads, a stock return 25% more than it did last year. If it's tails it loses 20%.  After one year, you make $1.25 for every dollar invested or $0.8 depending on the coin flip. That's straightforward enough.\n\nWhat about after two years? You hold the same stock. There are now four ways this could play out:\n\n* Heads / Heads : 1.25 x 1.25 = 1.56. i.e. $1 becomes $1.56 over two years.\n* Heads / Tails: 1.25 \\* 0.8 = 1. i.e. $1 becomes $1 over two years.\n* Tails / Heads: 0.8 \\* 1.25 = 1. i.e $1 becomes $1 over two years\n* Tails / Tails: 0.8 x 0.8 = 0.64. i.e. $1 becomes $0.6 over two years.\n\nNotice here that 3/4 of the outcomes are that you lose money or fail to make any money. Even though on average it's a winning bet to buy this stock. It turns out that picking stocks is analogous to this simplified example. Most stocks return about the same as [government treasury notes](https://www.universal-investment.com/media/document/Do%20Stocks%20outperform%20Treasury%20Bills) over their lifetime.\n\nThe reason beating the market is so hard is when you buy the market, you make the mean return. But as we've seen here the mean return is often way higher than the median!\n\nThere are a few stocks where all the wealth piles in to them and if you don't have those, your portfolio will suck. A wide index is guaranteed to have them. By definition an active strategy must be selective and that selectivity makes the game much harder.\n\nNow you get people saying look at tech over the last 20 years. But notice that the stocks to pick are always obvious in hindsight.\n\nIf people really knew Apple was going to be a trillion dollar company 20 years ago, why didn't it have a valuation like Tesla does today?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "That statement typically refers to ‘consistently’ beating the market each year. \nI.e few if any professional money managers have consistently beaten the market each year over long durations (remember W.
