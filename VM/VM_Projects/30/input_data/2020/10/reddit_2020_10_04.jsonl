{"title": "SPY Credit Spread Strategy", "selftext": "I am thinking about trading SPY short dated, tight put credit spreads, and would love to get some feedback on the following simple strategy, which at first thought sounds amazing.\n\n**The strategy**: On Monday, sell the Wednesday weekly expiration, 15 delta area $1 width SPY put spread (specifically the spread that has about $10 in premium). Buy back the put spread on day of expiration (i.e. Wednesday). Repeat for every weekly expiration date (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) of every week.\n\nThe 15 delta area put should have a strike at least 2.5 - 3% below the ATM strike.  If the market works against us and starts to tank, we will buy back our put spread at a loss as soon as the market is within 1% of our strike.\n\n**Example:** On Oct 4th, SPY is currently at 332.5. Selling the Wednesday Oct 9th expiration, 319 - 320 put credit spread gives us $10 in premium. We buy back on Wednesday near close for hopefully no more than $2. We net $8 on this trade, against a $100 of max loss potential. 8% growth. Rinse and repeat.\n\nNote that if the market tanked and at some point was 1% from our strike (i.e. at 323 area), we immediately buy back our put spread to close our position. The $10 premium we collected to sell our put credit spread will now cost about $30 to buy back (I arrived at this value by looking at what the 329-330 put credit spread, which is 1% below spot of 332.5, costs to buy). This represents a 10% - 30% = 20% loss (we collected 10, then lost 30, on a $100 collateral trade).\n\n**The Performance:** Now I know I'm making generalizations here, but hear me out.\n\n* There are about 50 \\* 3 = 150 weekly expirations in SPY. So we perform this strategy 150 times (we can of course do it even more frequently, but by selling to open on the weekly prior to the following weekly expiration, we collect the full 2 days of theta).\n* On trades where we win, we have 8% growth as seen in the example above. On losers, we have 20% loss. We only encounter a loser when we buy back our spread because SPY has dropped about 2-3% since we opened our spread (which would have been at most 2 days ago, because only 2 days between weekly exps). Let's say out of every 7 trades, 1 is a loser. I think it's probably much lower than 1/7, but I want to plan for the worst case. I haven't looked at historical data to determine what this precise ratio is (i.e. how frequent are bad trades).\n* From the bullet above, there are 150/7 = 22 losers, and  128 winners. Our returns over the year are thus 1.08\\^128 \\* (.8)\\^22 = 140. **Our returns are 140x.**\n\n**Caveats / Risks**\n\n* I get that the market can completely tank, but this is precisely why I say you buy back your spread AT ALL COSTS when the market is within 1% from your put spread legs. This way you limit your losses to about 20%.\n* the 8% growth, 20% loss calculation is based on today's SPY data. I know these numbers will change depending on what implied volatility SPY is priced on. Perhaps at the worst end growth may be only 5%, and loss might be 30%\n* It's completely unwise to dump all your money back into the next trade. If you are not careful with setting alerts/buying back when market is 1% away, then you could simply lose everything.\n\nThis sound quite amazing, and I want to understand what others think / show me why I'm wrong. It sounds like a very simple, well performing strategy. Obviously there's some execution nuances / risk as bulleted above, but if you're methodical and buy back, I don't see the problem here. We don't even care whether we're in a bull or bear market, because that's not very relevant on the tight, 2 day timeframe we're looking at.", "id": "j4v1pc", "created_utc": 1601796759.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "I have been doing this exact strategy for the past six or seven weeks. I've been selling 3-5 DTE credit spreads on SPY/QQQ/DIA and having a great win rate for a modest but not insignificant gain. It's an awesome, consistent, super profitable strategy... right up until it isn't\n\nA few things I have encountered that are really important to think about:\n\n* People are right about increasing IV--when the market starts to tank, you're getting screwed doubly from it going against you AND options prices getting inflated. People are also right about these being so close to expiration that you're not giving yourself enough time to be right. It requires you to monitor your trades really closely which can be extremely stressful and time consuming.\n* Also I'm not sure how you manage day trades, but to consistently follow this strategy, you're probably going to have to use them. I noticed this a week or so into doing the strategy, so I started to alternate between SPY, QQQ and DIA. They are fairly well correlated, so you can vary between them without too much trouble. However...\n* The biggest risk: ***gap-downs***. You can be as disciplined as you want about exiting if it goes against you until you wake up and see that the market is down big and your options expire tomorrow. As I mentioned above, I was alternating between SPY, DIA and QQQ to avoid incurring day trades and just so happened to be holding 5 QQQ credit spreads on September 3rd and got *CRUSHED* when the market gapped down like 3% overnight and kept falling on open. I have a relatively small account so I started freaking out. My spreads went from being worth about $3-$4 each to being worth $35 or $40. I closed 3 as soon as I could for about a $100 loss and let the other 2 go (I had about 5 DTE if I'm remembering correctly). I was hoping things would bounce back and I'd recover some of those losses. I didn't. I ended up losing about $300 of my $500.\n\nI still believed in the strategy long term, but people commenting here are right: you're risking $100 for a \\~$10 gain. So I made some changes:\n\n1. Don't trade with QQQ anymore. It's too freaking volatile.\n2. Don't trade bull put spreads. This makes sense if you think about it: the volatility skew is not in your favor (puts tend to be a little more expensive than calls), not to mention ITM options usually have larger spreads than OTM options (0.02-0.04 vs 0.05+). This magnified my losses because when I went to get out once the market tanked, the spread was like 0.15 wide.\n3. Also, upon reflection, I realized that the chances of a 3-5% gap ***down*** were much higher than the chances of a 3-5% gap ***up***. Instead I started using bear call spreads. The odds are tilted a little more in my favor because of that, not to mention the spreads are tighter on OTM calls than they are on ITM puts, which also works for me rather than against me.\n4. Don't pick strikes purely based on delta. For such short term plays, points of resistance are way more important. Go back through the last couple of weeks of the chart and look at where the market bounced off a resistance point. The more recent bounces you see the better.\n\nI re-implemented the strategy with these new insights and have been successful so far (knock on wood), though it took me about 3 weeks to gain back what I lost in literally one day.\n\nSorry for the novel, it's just the first time I have really verbalized my experience and what I learned so it was kind of instructive for me to write it all out. I hope it was helpful.\n\nEdit: spelling & grammar", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "This is super helpful, thanks a lot! It's great to hear from someone that's actually spent some time testing it out. I'm going to read your comment a couple more times, but few questions\n\n1. I understand your argument for why not to use bull put spreads. Because of the vol skew, puts are more expensive than calls (for equities). However doesn't that also imply that the premiums you'll collect from an x delta put spread are greater than that of the x delta call spread?\n2. So do you instead recommend trading call credit spreads if I'm trying to collect premium (i.e. I'm not looking for debit spread trades here). And if not, what spreads are you mainly trading?\n3. About day trades, given that we get exactly 3 within 5 days, I thought this would work well even in the worst case scenario that for all 3 trades of the week (Monday, Wed, Fri) I have to buy back my spread on that day. How often would you say you had to use up a day trade? For now, I don't see myself placing too many trades simply because I want to get the hang of it and I don't have a 25k+ account yet.\n4. I've also heard about playing spreads on inverse ETFs like SQQQ . In the case of SQQQ, I'd actually buy put spreads (contrary to selling like I said in bullet 2) because I'm betting SQQQ continues to go down. Have you ever tried this out on a leveraged ETF and/or an inverse ETF?\n5. What risk/reward ratio do you think is good? I.e. for $100 collateral, how much premium should do you aim to collect in what time frame?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks a ton", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "No problem--happy to help. With regard to your questions:\n\n1. The vol skew isn't that big of a deal compared to the price spread in my opinion, but just the fact that puts tend to be a little more sensitive to IV than calls makes me shy away from them. IV usually increases when prices are going down, not up. So with call credit spreads even if IV does increase (bad for me) delta is decreasing (good for me). Don't forget: it's not even about the option prices themselves, it's about the difference in premium between them. The closer they get to ATM, the bigger difference in premium between the strikes because the chance that it could go either way increases. So, the fact that they're puts isn't terribly important, it's just one little thing among many that makes me lean toward call spreads.\n2. Yes, I prefer to trade call credit spreads with this strategy. Getting burned so hard with QQQ just soured me on doing this with bull put spreads. The probability of profit is similar, but just seeing QQQ blow through my strikes was demoralizing. With index funds like these, you're just more likely to see a large gap down than a large gap up, and even when there is a gap up overnight there's usually a pullback mid-morning where I can get out before it surges higher. *I can bank on mean reversion much more readily than I can bank on there NOT being a correction.*\n3. I don't tend to alternate indexes too much lately because after reading into it, day trades only count for \"*open-close*\" trades \"of the same or a substantially similar security\" in the same day. Until I dug into it, I wasn't sure if \"*close-open*\" trades counted as day trades. They don't, so that allows me to roll more easily. I don't use more than 2 or 3 day trades in a week, but it just makes me a little nervous to potentially be trapped in a strategy because I don't want to get flagged. I only tend to use them when scaling in/out of a position. For example, when the trade I have on reaches \\~50% profit, I'll usually buy back 2 or 3 spreads and roll them out to the next expiration. I've done that in the morning a couple of times and then there happens to be a big price decline later in the day and I've already gotten to my 50% target. If I want to manage my risk and really follow the strategy, I should close my positions, so I do it and take the day trade. I'd do the same thing if it went against me. It's more about having the option (pun intended) to use them if I need them.\n4. I haven't tried it on anything leveraged or inverse and probably won't--at least right now. The volatility scares me too much because when it goes against you, it goes *HARD* (e.g. SQQQ increased almost 10% on Friday if you include after hours). QQQ burned me too bad. If I were going to do it on with a leveraged underlying I'd probably do it on a leveraged DJIA product since the Dow tends to be the least volatile of the major indexes. Just be cognizant of the fact that options are leverage, so you're using leverage on a leveraged underlying during one of the most volatile times in recent market history.\n5. As far as risk/reward goes, just do what you're comfortable with while also remembering that--for the most part, the lower your max profit the higher probability that you're going to realize said profit. I usually shoot for \\~$15 max profit with 3-5 DTE and close them between $5 and $10 which allows me to roll them every day or two. But like I said I focus on resistance points so if the next area of significant resistance puts my max profit at $10, I'd rather be a little conservative and take that higher probability than be on the wrong side of a breakout. I'll probably be willing to risk more once I have a larger account, but right now a $500 loss would be a decent sized hit.\n6. You didn't ask about this, but from my experience it's also good try to use predictable-ish intraday price movements and mean reversion to your advantage. That usually means opening/closing positions in the morning or the afternoon when volatility is the highest. So again, if SPY gaps up overnight and opens like 2% higher, the tendency is that it will fall and \"fill in\" most of those skipped prices in the next couple of hours, even if it keeps going higher for the rest of the day. This also tends to happen when it gaps down, but is more predictable for a gap up. Those movements are your chances scale in/out to increase your max profit.\n\nSorry again for the novel, but I hope I answered your questions.", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I have also adopted a similar strategy and have been refining it for the past three months.    I would allocate 50% in longer-dated spreads (\\~30DTE @ 0.35-0.45 credit) on airlines and bank stocks, or any of those low-volatility stocks. \n\n30% would be dedicated to these spy spread strategies, which is what I am diving deeper into. I'd prefer to open 1-3DTE with a credit of 0.1 to as high as 0.25 depending on the market. Throughout the months, I've honed in on a couple of strategies to help optimize your P/L.\n\nDuring low volatility environments, before September, I started out opening spread positions further OTM, around 0.10 to 0.15 credit with 1 to 3 DTE, which proves mostly successful because of the massive uptrend in August in.\n\nI've noticed how price action usually bounces off areas of support and resistance, which proves to optimize the credit to risk ratio with the probabilities of success. \n\nDeveloping patience is key because I've noticed how whenever you open a position, there is going to be some point in time where the spread would increase in value, especially during higher volatility. so my strategy is to find opportunities to add more positions over time, don't just open 20 right at once, instead break it up into multiple batches of 4 spreads throughout the day. \n\nMix it up with puts or calls credit spreads depending on the market direction, it boils down to waiting for an optimal price, where you see a bounce or consolidation near areas of support/resistance (refrain from catching a falling knife). Also, take into account if there is a bullish/bearish bias respective to the trend of the hourly/2hr chart. With this strategy, you have to have massive amounts of patience and discipline.\n\nExit strategies: what you've mentioned was great for a lower premium to risk ratio, but you have other options for cutting loss. Rolling to a later date and/or lower strike is advised only if you have more than 3 days left to expiration. Regarding closer expirations, there is a hard stop if the prices reach your short strike (\\~0.5 loss to close).\n\nBut if the market suddenly turns against you, sometimes closing only the short strike would be a viable way to turntables. IT is CRUCIAL to open your spread is around the area of support (preferably have a one-point buffer to reduce stress), you should wait to see if the support holds or breaks. If the price dips below your area of support and fails to regain the key level, I'd recommend having spare cash on the side to close the short strike and ride the sell-off. It proved fruitful for my spreads in early September, where I realized the sheer downward momentum and cut my short strike after the support failed to hold, turning my 30% loss into a 40% gain. Please note that you're taking on significant risk and it will be devastating if the price reverses after you close your short strike, so don't act in advance, wait for price rejection confirmation before taking action. Take investor psychology into account, when prices tend to make lower lows (or higher highs against your spread), you might have to close your spread earlier so that you can live to trade another day. Especially in September, the strategy of closing out the short strike during a sell-off has saved my losses (just don't be too greedy and prepare to take profits when momentum slows and your long strike reaches close to the closing price of the short strike). Right now, especially before elections, I am more conservative with my spreads because of the sheer uncertainty in the markets.\n\nFinally, for high volatility environments, it's usually more favorable to open a 0.15-0.3 spread after waiting for the price to bounce from support or resistance so that your risk and reward ratio would be more favorable. Most of the time I'm waiting for a significant drop or climb, and then a small reversal to confirm the direction. I'd like to get my daily S&P numbers from the Kendall Report, someone who has mastered his craft of technical analysis for over 40 years, though he provides interesting insight of key pivot point numbers, no one is 100% correct in their analysis, so trade accordingly to how the market reacts. Key takeaways for October, look for areas of support at 330 if that breaks then 323. 342 is a strong resistance level.\n\nFor the risk/reward ratio, for <1 week, 0.15-0.25 (15-25% of collateral) is more favorable, from one week to one month, open 0.25-0.35 credit, and for greater than one month, 0.35-0.45 credit is optimal.

{"title": "Why AMD Is Going To Moon In October", "selftext": "Welcome to the Theta Gang!\n\nThe next gen consoles are all going to use AMD chips. And the holidays are coming up in Q4. You know what every kid and millennial wants this year? You guessed it, the XBOX Series X and the Playstation 5.\n\nDon’t believe me, here you go you nerds:\n\n“This is due in large part to the raw power of the custom designed processor, powered by an 8 core AMD [Zen 2 CPU](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/03/16/xbox-series-x-glossary/) and an [RDNA 2-class GPU](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/03/16/xbox-series-x-glossary/).”\n\n[https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/03/16/xbox-series-x-tech/](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/03/16/xbox-series-x-tech/)\n\nThe PS5 will feature a custom eight-core AMD Zen 2 CPU clocked at 3.5GHz (variable frequency) and a custom GPU based on AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture hardware that promises 10.28 teraflops and 36 compute units clocked at 2.23GHz (also variable frequency).\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21183181/sony-ps5-playstation-5-specs-details-hardware-processor-8k-ray-tracing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21183181/sony-ps5-playstation-5-specs-details-hardware-processor-8k-ray-tracing)\n\nAnd AMD doesn’t just peak here. Su bae is going to unveil their new Zen 3 CPU’s this Thursday on October 8th and it is going to send Intel back to the stone age. AMD is gaining more and more market share from Intel. Early Zen 3 leaks and benchmarks are showing big improvements over the previous gen Zen 2 chips which already crushed Intel. We are talking 15% faster in multi-threaded apps and 25% faster in single-threaded apps. \n\n[https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-9-5900x-12-core-24-thread-zen-3-cpu-benchmark-leak-out/](https://wccftech.com/amd-ryzen-9-5900x-12-core-24-thread-zen-3-cpu-benchmark-leak-out/)\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, AMD and is also going after NVDA at the end of the month with their RDNA graphics card release on October 28th. Want more data? Benchmarks online show their new RX 6000 series to be as fast as Nvidia’s previous flagship RTX 2080Ti and it’s gonna be much cheaper!\n\n[https://wccftech.com/amd-next-gen-radeon-rx-6000-series-rdna-2-graphics-cards-benchmarks-leak/](https://wccftech.com/amd-next-gen-radeon-rx-6000-series-rdna-2-graphics-cards-benchmarks-leak/)\n\nSteam’s latest hardware survey also showed that AMD is increasing their PC gaming market share as well. My dude /u/BoardButcherer posted this DD showing AMD has a 25% market share for the PC Master Race, growing at a rate of 1% a month.\n\n[https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-rises-to-25-market-share-on-steam-survey](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/amd-rises-to-25-market-share-on-steam-survey)\n\nSome of you right now are saying so what? I only care about technical analysis. Well I’ve got that for you as well. Here’s my crayon drawing of the AMD stock chart.\n\n[DM me if you have questions](https://preview.redd.it/w4pwb86gt4r51.jpg?width=2067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4c032bf16b1c6ce1cca375682a45eb2b90885a4)\n\nSee those big, green candles? Yeah, expect to see more of them this month. We just had 6 straight green days in a row before the Mango Man became overripe. Last week we broke above the 50 and 21 day moving averages, broke above 3 of my resistance levels and we are not even overbought yet on the RSI. We had a small pullback with the rest of the tech market on Friday due to Donnie Dump but that’s a buy the dip opportunity. Based on my technical analysis we have support at about $81 right now.\n\nSo when moon? Who knows? These are all-time highs for AMD so there is no historical price data. I think we can get to at least $85 by the end of next week, at least $90 by the end of the month, probably close to $100 a share. This is all assuming Trumperino doesn’t Crumperino. \n\nOh and what about the stimmy? Stevey Munchkin and Nancy P have been going on more hot dates than usual lately.
