Here's my watch list for today.\n\nGap Ups: APRN, BNTX, CODX, NTGN, PTON, REGN,\n\nGap Downs: NONE\n\nPossible day 2 movers: AAL, GSX, HUYA, UBER, JNUG, RAD, SFM\n\nCoronavirus related stocks that could move: APT, MRNA, VIR, LAKE, CODX, INO\n\nLooks like these virus stocks might try to make another move today. I will want to see some sort of strength and hold before I go long, the gaps may fade off at first as strength has been faded at immediate open for weeks now. Not much interests me today so my main focus will be on the market itself (TQQQ). It would be nice to see the market base for a bit. Support on SPY around the 234/235 area, well have to see if if holds. In markets like this support tends to be broken fairly easy as we have seen on the way down so far. Not ideal market for new traders, my suggestion if you are new is to sit back and watch, trade paper, or trade small. Patience is your friend and cash is a position to.
