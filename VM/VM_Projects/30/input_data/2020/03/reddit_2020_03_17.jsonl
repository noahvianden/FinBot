I will want to see some sort of strength and hold before I go long, the gaps may fade off at first as strength has been faded at immediate open for weeks now.

Support on SPY around the 234/235 area, well have to see if if holds. In markets like this support tends to be broken fairly easy as we have seen on the way down so far.
