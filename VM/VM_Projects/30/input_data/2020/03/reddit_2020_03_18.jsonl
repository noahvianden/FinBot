Here's my watch list \n\nGap Ups: APRN, BMRA, BNTX, DWT, IMV, NTGN, TVIX/UVXY, VXRT\n\nGap Downs: ALC (under lows), CUK (could be exhaustion gap), TSM, UAL (could be exhaustion gap)\n\nPossible Coronavirus related plays: AHPI, NVAX, VIR\n\nWe talked about SPY and the 234/235 area support level days ago. This morning SPY hit 235 pre market and made a small bounce which showed us there is some interest in that area, not sure how much interest and support levels don't matter as much in bear markets. Most stocks extremely oversold so we will have to see if the market can hold that level before entering any longs. I will be focusing on TQQQ/TVIX/UVXY, this is because there are not many good gaps with catalyst and most everything is gapping down with the market and still oversold. If the market holds the 234/235 level we could see a bounce. If not maybe we see more selling or choppiness.  This has been a difficult market even for the best, anyone that tells you different is most likely lying and wants your money. Not ideal market for new traders.

{"title": "EWP DD", "selftext": "\n\n \n\nSPAIN (EWP) ( Not as detailed in the macroeconomics because you cant get options for further out than 7 months so make do )\n\nSpain is a country in the EU. Proper shit, you know. But we aren’t here to talk about Spain and how the EU is shit. We are just hear to talk about Spain and form an opinion at the end – I don’t have one yet so hopefully this DD let’s me form an opinion on Spain. So let’s begin:\n\nSpain has a GDP of 1.4 trillion dollars. It’s GDP per capita is around 30k. The ETF relevant for Spain is EWP. Currently trading at 19.xx, I have no clue on its outlook yet. The economy of Spain is varied and ‘capitalist’. Spain is currently under a lockdown and has a bleak outlook. This will be referenced later.\n\nLet’s continue with the economy: Spain’s economy is built on tourism, energy, automotive manufacturing and agribusiness. Well, the Chinese Virus fucked up tourism both domestic and foreign. Tourism makes up around 5% of the economy but tourism makes up less than 5% of the ETF. The company is called Amadeus IT.\n\nETF Holdings: (in order of weighting)\n\n1. Iberdrola is a Spanish multinational electric utility company\n2. Banco Santander, S.A., doing business as Santander Group, is a Spanish multinational commercial bank and financial services company\n3. Industria de Diseño Textil, S.A. is a Spanish multinational clothing company\n4. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A., better known by its initialism BBVA, is a Spanish multinational financial services company\n5. Cellnex Telecom is a Spanish wireless telecommunications infrastructure and services company with a projected portfolio of up to 53,000 locations across Europe .\n6. Ferrovial, S.A., previously Grupo Ferrovial, is a Spanish multinational company involved in the design, construction, financing, operation and maintenance of transport infrastructure and urban services.\n7. Amadeus IT Group, S.A. is a major Spanish IT provider for the global travel and tourism business.\n8. Telefónica, S.A. is a Spanish multinational telecommunications company. It is one of the largest telecommunication companies in the world.\n9. Grifols, S.A. is a Spanish multinational pharmaceutical and chemical manufacturer.\n10. Repsol S.A. is a fossil fuel company and it is vertically integrated and operates in all areas of the oil and gas industry, including exploration and production, refining, distribution and marketing, petrochemicals, power generation and trading.\n\nNow since YTD, EWP has been down 33.2% while SPY has been down 22.18%.\n\nThis is how much each company in the ETF has also lost since YTD.\n\n1. IBE – down 1.17% but 18% since ATH in Feb before the crash\n2. SAN – down 43% YTD\n3. ITX – down 33%\n4. BVA – down 44%\n5. CLNX – up 1.19% and down 19% since ATH in Feb before the crash\n6. FER – down 27.89%\n7. AMS down 35.52%\n8. TEf down 31.31%\n9. GRF down 14.38% YTD and down 20.59% from ATH in Feb\n10. REP down 51.898%\n\nSITREP:\n\nSpain is currently under lockdown, they have locked down the entire nation. It was a rapid and sudden response meaning many people in their houses don’t have essentials so the government has seized the means of production to ‘ensure’ food gets to the people. Private hospitals were seized for their beds and other facilities.\n\nAccording to John McAfee, the country is under total lockdown and people are being fined for ignoring the measures. The transport minister has said that the lockdown will be longer than 15 days,( [https://euobserver.com/coronavirus/147763](https://euobserver.com/coronavirus/147763))\n\nI assume they will go into April’s 2nd week as the country is still not at a peak. Here’s a graph on the cases and deaths:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/nFYODZ8](https://imgur.com/a/nFYODZ8)\n\nSpain’s cases are still rapidly increasing and with this rate of growth – there should be 18000 cases by the end of the week and about 700 deaths. The lockdown will damage the Spanish economy in the long term and of course short term.\n\nNow for the strikes and dates,\n\nThe ETF is currently trading at 19.55. There are 3 realistic exp dates: 4/17, 7/17 and 10/17. Clearly the volume is low asf.\n\nI believe spain like the rest of the world is heading for a recession so puts for either 7/17 or 10/17 is the way to go. Strike for 17/18.\n\nDisclaimer: I don’t own any and don’t plan on.

I dont think I even know where to start.\n\nThe company has been posting terrible results in the last quarters. Showing 8% decline in Net sales consecutively. Which is crazy.\n\n[Latest 10-Q Form](https://preview.redd.it/0spash9t8hn41.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=941a7e42b4bb3a8e7937dee5ccb81feee7526917)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Previous 10-Q Form](https://preview.redd.it/cbgvlbpe9hn41.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=2af88047f0506d629065278f2aec3d5ee0075203)\n\nThis is specially bad considering they were already in a steep decline\n\nAs of 2019 third quarter, the company has posted losses for about $38M (bout 30 cents a share) Which is also pretty bad for a $1.7B company\n\nAlso, for the past year they started doing deep share buybacks. So cash situation is also bad.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tqfkq325ahn41.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=40f1cf4452cbd4dcd15c898dfe8bd71b1d30bd04\n\nThe company decided to remove the 2019 Financial guidelines (which is basically saying they're not going to meet them), and deployed a \"new strategy\" for 2020. They did this in early January before they could possible be aware of the beervirus so I'm assuming here that the plan is about to change.\n\nFinally, debt. Oh yes. There is debt. At the end of 2019, the company announced lay-offs and some store/sections closings. As for November 2019, the D/E ratio was 2. Yes, TWO. Meaning 2 thirds of the company is due as obligation in the next 6 years (moreso in 2020/2021 with leasing and shit)\n\nWhen it comes down to it, do you see them evolving in the next two quarters into profitability? If they don't do it by then, they'll need to merge.\n\nPuts are quite cheap still, so don't go too OTM because not sure how much room left this company has to fall. Could they go to 0? Maybe I'm crazy but I don't see people changing house appliances (at least the ones that do are not doing it in BBBY)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: $BBBY Puts $4.50 4/9-4/17.", "id": "fkvdd4", "created_utc": 1584559302.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "Low volume and high volatility", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "This", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I´ll exercise if needed I don't care", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "same boat!

{"title": "[DD] All Lakers and Nets tested for the virus. Recovery begins 3/31.", "selftext": "We have quite a dangerous situation on our hands, right?  This is no joke.  \n\nAccordingly, we are taking this matter very seriously.  It's like super serious!   Like people will die and society will unravel.  Years from now you will tell future generations about the _disgusting_ things you had to do to get your 300th extra roll of toilet paper. \n\n So what are we doing:\n\n- Closing schools (remember how many times they didn't close your school when you were a kid and now they close it for at least a month!  Kids these days have it so easy!).  Yep.\n\n- Restricting travel to other countries.  Yep.\n\n- Closing restaurants and bars (drinking away the pain at home just doesn't express my misery enough, I need to be in some piece of shit bar drinking grain alcohol).  Yep.\n\n- America alone spending at least a trillion to address it.  Yeppers.\n\n- Giving everyone equal access to test since it's a \"humanitarian crisis\".  Wait... \n\nThe testing facility won't even test me unless I see a doctor and prove that I don't have the flu or strep throat first.  That means I have to go to see a doctor before I can go to the testing facility you're asking me to go to during work hours since I can't go to work because the virus is so serious, I can't even work).  And yet ALL of the Lakers and Nets have been tested and they didn't even have to get out of their car once to do it.\n\nIt's almost as if, [cash rules everything around me.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBwAxmrE194). \n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBecause it does.  And there's a lot less money being spent in a world where I sit on the my couch holding onto my cash to make sure I make my mortgage payment.  They'd much rather I give some money to my weed guy, spend a ton more money buying snacks and then my weed guy buys Jordan's with the money I paid him.  Win-Win-Win.\n\nGiving the Lakers and Nets special access to testing shows the common denominator in life is STILL money.    Come the end of the month people will prioritize money again, everyone will go back to work, and the economy will make money again.  \n\nWhy 3/31?  Because changing the calendar changes your mentality when it comes to big events.  You'll suddenly feel different in April.  The virus will be so-February by then.  Plus, April means Spring in people's minds.  And like the old saying goes \"Hope Springs Eternal Hope in the Spring\"\n\nPosition:  **CALLS MUTHFUCKA!** 6/19 The strike is SPY's opening amount on 3/31+25%.
