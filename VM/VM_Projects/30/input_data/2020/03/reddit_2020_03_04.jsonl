{"title": "Splunk (SPLK) 3/4/2020 AMC - Splunk for everyone", "selftext": "Stock: [Splunk](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fmarketplace%2Fseller-profile%3Fid%3D6a766d61-5a6a-4c97-83f4-8bfe02b74914&psig=AOvVaw1-7xk35I1P7BNaNAo8EGdB&ust=1583436087951000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCLjmnKDFgegCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAD)**(SPLK) - 152.18$**\n\nDirection: **Mildly Bullish**\n\n**Price Target:** **160$**\n\n**Type: Put Credit Spread**\n\n**Fundamental:** Splunk is a growth company simply for its 16 quarters of consecutive double digit growth. Splunk sports a very high, but not astronomical PE, with decent profitability and a consistent record of beating earnings guidance. The recent acquisition (6 month) of SignalFx gives them further footprint in the booming cloud computing sector. An additional note is an announcement of a DoD contract with some huge numbers on it. While I cannot explain its actual effects, I do believe this is a positive for Splunk. \n\n**Technical**: Priced below 20, 50 day averages and below 200 day moving average. MACD shows bullish convergence. RSI shows around 48, coming up from oversold. Options sentiments are very bullish in volume and bullish open interest. Implied movement is 9.1% or about 13.85$ Short interest is at 4.6%, with 5.6 days to cover. One thing to note, the ATM straddle is actually getting cheaper, with a tiny IV contraction. While not a strong signal, I believe this is bullish for Splunk, as contracting IV is not a normality in current macro environments. The skew to call side reinforces this idea. \n\n**Sentimental**: Splunk has been beating and raising for more than 4 years. This track record of growth and performance weights positively. Analyst sentiments are bullish with a higher price target than SPLK’s current price. Numerous partnerships with kings like AWS, CISCO, Accenture give Splunk a competitive moat. While not directly affected by the coronavirus, Splunk will need a massive win to command a big upward move. The main wildcard is the DoD deal updates, which can be a massive boost. Primary bear case is missing estimates and guiding lower. \n\n**Robinhood (3/4/2020) Less Fucky. Not using. Moving to Schwab this weekend.** \n\n**Put Credit Spread 3/13**\n\n**Buy 135 Put**\n\n**Sell 140 Put**\n\n**Everyone is into big data, cloud and becoming big brother without looking like big brother. Splunk is currently the leader in this sector and has minimal effects from current market fears.**", "id": "fdi5ow", "created_utc": 1583349716.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "This guys bolds his words\n\nHe might be on to something", "score": 28, "replies": []}, {"body": "use splunk at my work. very useful tool.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "I’m confused, this user seems like he knows his shit but he never posts gain porn, what the fuck?", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "You crazy fuck.

{"title": "Unusual Options - SBUX/FEYE/NFLX", "selftext": "Today I included the aggressive orders, SBUX seems really unusual.\n\nThese options orders  are on or above the ask. Many have the same expiry and strike. Also lots  of the orders were sweeps so these ppl were  breaking down their order to get filled faster.\n\nAlso all  these orders volume of the contracts exceeded the open  interest    in   multiple trades so it's most likely not closing  positions.  Either    buy     to  open orders or sell to open orders and  based on  the    aggressiveness  of the orders one can infer its buy to  open. Some  of     these may be    hedges  and some most likely not.\n\nData is here - [https://ibb.co/z8VP2VJ](https://ibb.co/z8VP2VJ)\n\nThis is just some of today's orders, i know it is late in the day but I am doing the best I can do right now to post these.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe SBUX orders are very aggressive, normally sbux does not have so many sweeping orders especially all puts going way OTM (60 put). Unsure if their is a dividend date or any news pending but that should be watched. Part of the FEYE call move is already over so unsure if that is worth chasing. NFLX calls are expecting a breakout above resistance but they have gotten the timing wrong before so I don't think anyone should chase those, if you do go out further and look into spreads.\n\nThe safest put seems SBUX since its many months away. If anyone has any idea why so many puts in sweeps happened today let me know\n\nDon't just enter YOLO's in positions based on this data alone in most cases. Use  technicals/fundamentals/options data/market feelings all combined  instead of just 1 of these.   Use protection like  spreads if you worry  about losing what u   put in     and    be  smart,  understand the risks of putting $ into weekly  expiry's, consider a longer expiry.\n\nAlso with the market going lower use technicals/fundamentals/options data-flow/market  sediment all combined.\n\nI wanted to add, 50 Cent VIX trader ruffer llp (or whatever) is still holding their vix calls as of 3-4-20.\n\nAlso, someone said ibb has ads so use an adblocker we are in 2020", "id": "fdjwgq", "created_utc": 1583356532.0, "score": 26, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "\"The safest put seems SBUX\"\n\nAll in SBUX Puts", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "It doubled in price  (100+%) from when I saw it a few days ago, hope u made tendies.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "So all in SBUX $60p 3/20", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Yup.
