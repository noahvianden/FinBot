It wasn’t great but I needed some insurance Incase we went sideways and my puts start feeling the burn. Same reason I ghetto spread my 3/20 puts to buy back when we pop tomorrow before the big drop. Just trying to rake small amount of free money where I can. Theta gang is the ultimate get out of jail free card. Sure you don’t make retard level autistic gains from capping them.

In my experience further OTM doesn’t work as well as it seems which is why i go closer to the money now. Better risk/reward. \n\nIt might seem like your odds are a lot worse but it ends up no worse than buying options without worrying about IV crush.
