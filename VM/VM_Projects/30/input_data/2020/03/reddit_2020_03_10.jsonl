I cbf explaining definitions.\n\nAnyways, assuming you've read above and now know what it is, you can pretty much refer to the big short for in depth detail of what's going to happen, but this shit is massive. And for some fucking reason, no one is talking about it. I mean it's twice the size of CDOs back in 2008 (CDOs were about $1tn in size, CLOs are like [$2tn](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/bank-overground/2019/how-large-is-the-leveraged-loan-market), we haven't even talked about what numbers shadow banking is hiding). \n\nSo essentially what the banks have been doing for the past decade, is bundling up shit junk tier and BBB corporate bond with the AAA rated corporate bonds, since no one wanted to lend out money to shit companies with no cash flows (also it would incur heaps high interest rates), so that debt investors could buy into the CLOs providing financing to all the companies that are meshed together within the CLO (most of em are [shit](https://www.blackrock.com/institutions/en-us/insights/investment-actions/assessing-risks-in-bbb-corporate-bonds)).\n\nNow cue coronavirus, these BBB are going to get exposed for what they really are -- junk tier, interest rates are going to go up (as credit rating has fallen), the firms ain't gonna have the cash flow to cough up shit and we have armageddon all over again. Here's a quote from Blackrock in Oct 2019 last year:\n\n>   We believe the sharp increase in the proportion of BBB-rated constituents has made the investment-grade bond sector riskier than in recent years. BBB-rated bonds are typically the most vulnerable of all investment-grade debt in a recession. Any downgrade of such bonds would relegate them from the investment-grade universe to the high yield universe (making them “fallen angels”), which would negatively re-rate their value.\n\n> Analysis by Morgan Stanley has found that significant volumes of BBB-rated bonds were downgraded in previous credit downturns. In the 2007-09, 2000-03 and 1989-91 downturns, between 23% and 45% of investment-grade bonds were downgraded to junk. If downgrade rates were to remain at such levels, **the next downturn could see approximately $600 billion of BBB bonds consigned to junk status.**\n\nToo long to read? yeah i didn't read all of that shit either, just read the bolded tho and also keep in mind that this was all said before the coronavirus even happened, in other words, when everything was roses and daisies. \n\nAlright enough with the research (we haven't even talked about synthetic collateralized loan obligations), let's talk about tendies. \n\nSome of these [CLOs are already blowing up](https://www.reuters.com/article/clo-rescuefinancing/clos-seek-flexibility-for-distressed-assets-amid-lender-competition-idUSL1N2AJ1NB) so opportunity for tendies are still here.
