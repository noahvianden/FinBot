I am going to answer your nine questions below, but please read, read, and read again everything you can about the basics before diving in because based on this it seems as if you still are a ways away from having an understanding on options strong enough to trade them.\n\n1. Sell the contract whenever you would like.  You can realize large gains on the contract well before it hits the strike price.  Look into IV. You will make the most money if it gets in the money, but sometimes waiting for that will burn you because every day closer to expiration the option becomes just a little more worthless (theta decay).  Time is valuable on options, and the more time you have on the contract, the more valuable it will likely be.  I frequently sell my contracts before they hit the strike price because there is no guarantee that it will get there.  All about your conviction on the trade.\n\n2. See above, if the share price hits the strike price, the contract is not yet in the money, because you have to pay to acquire the contract.  The cost of the contract / 100 + share price is the true break even for someone if they were to exercise it.\n\n3. No..I am unsure what this question is asking.  But if you BOUGHT a contract (\"Buy to Open\") you bought a contract that previously existed on the options market.  You can choose to sell that contract to someone else, or exercise it, which means you need the cash to buy 100 shares at the strike you chose.\n\n4. Yes, contract prices can change extremely quickly as they are very volatile assets.  Look into Volume and Open Interest.  A contract with low volume will be hard to sell, because no ones buying, and if you can sell it, you may not get what you want for it if just using a market order instead of a stop or limit.\n\n5. Yes - see 4.\n\n6. No, if you sold the contract, you're no longer part of the chain.  The contract is always attributable to the original person who wrote it and whoever the current owner is.  Once you sell it to someone else, its their's.  But remember, you may have a misunderstanding here.  If you BOUGHT the contract you have the RIGHT but not the OBLIGATION to exercise it.  You have defined risk (the price of the contract).  The person who WROTE the contract has much greater risk and has the obligation to perform whatever the contract says by expiration, if the person who holds it chooses to exercise it.\n\n7. Correct, you have bought the RIGHT to buy 100 shares at the strike price by the expiration date.  You do not have to exercise it, ever, if you do not want to.\n\n8. No. Because the cost of an already in the money contract is an additional cost.  If I buy a call contract that is in the money already (say its at strike $50) and the contract cost me $500 and the stock is trading at $51 when I bought the contract, I will go buy the shares at $50 x 100 which equals $5,000. $5,000 + $500 = $5,500 to acquire 100 shares where if I went out on the market to buy them directly it would cost me $5,100.\n\n9.

I've read some, and also watched some vid, and I might have to watch 10 more vid to understand fully, because there was some math involved, but I kinda get the concept.... I think. lol\n\nOh and for the 3rd question- sorry If my question wasn't clear. English is my second language. I was asking about the sell price. You know when you try to buy call option, and prices vary, some are 2.00 and some are 0.02. I watched this one guy try to sell call option, and he was setting the price?- not sure if that's what he was doing, but it looked like that's what he was doing. so I thought, If he had to set the price,\n\nHow do I know the right price to set it when the time comes to sell the contract I bought?\n\nI thought all thoses call and sell prices were set by robinhood! actually I didn't even know they were contracts made by other users.\n\nStonks are crazzy! so incredible.\n\nI can't believe I'm only just finding out about this world!!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": ">1. Do you sell the contract as soon as it goes above my strike price? (ex current price of $76 and above)\n\nAn option is officially ITM when the price of the underlying is above the strike price + the premium for one share you paid to enter the trade.\n\n So let's say it cost you $3 total to enter a SBUX call. ($0.03x100). That $0.03 premium would be added onto the strike price. So SBUX would need to sit above $76.03 before expiration for your option to be ITM. \n\nAt that point, you can either sell it and harvest profits, or you can hold it in the hopes that SBUX will continue to climb and make you more money. \n\n>2. What happens if share price only hit your exact strike price? Is that same thing as nothing?\n\nYes. Your option would then expire ATM (at-the-money), and you lose what you put up to enter the trade. \n\n>3. Am I responsible for selling back the contract at the price I set?\n\nNo. You can sell the option at any price with a market order, or at a specific price with a limit order.\n\n>4. Is speed everything? can share price fall while I try to sell my contract?\n\nOf course it can.\n\n>5. Is it possible I won't be able to sell my contract? or do they sell real quick?\n\nAs long as the bid/ask is moving, your option will eventually get bought. \n\n>6. Once you sell back a contract that you brought (whether a call or a put) on the open market after making a profit off of it, is it close or can you still end up losing or making money even though you sold it?\n\nYou have exited the position once your option that you sold has been bought. No more risk beyond that point.\n\n>7. Is buying call option is not buying the stock, so you don't need the actual amount of money to buy the contract worth stock. (ex. I don't need $7357 to buy 1contract. all I need is $150)\n\nYou're buying the right, but not the obligation to buy the stock. If you have an interest in actually owning 100 shares of the underlying, then you will need the strike price x 100 in cash in your account to cover the cost of your broker buying 100 shares. \n\nIf the trader who sold you the option does not own 100 shares of the underlying, they have to fetch 100 shares at market. If they do own 100 shares, Trader A incurs no monetary loss.\n\n Then, the cash amount needed to buy 100 shares will be debited from your account, and you should have the shares by end of day. \n\n>8. Doesn't this mean whenever I want to buy stock, can't I buy at lower price? just buy the contract and exercise the call? why do ppl buy them in MP then?\n\nThe option gives you the right to buy stock at the strike price, regardless of current market price of the same stock. \n\n>9. how many of these contracts can I buy?
