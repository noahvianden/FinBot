A lot of these companies are bringing on a lot of debt in order to keep afloat with no revenue - how bad is this debt? What sort of interest rates are they paying? How long until they can use cash on hand to reward shareholders instead of paying off debt? On top of debt issued through credit lines (cruise lines), what sort of cash is raised through new stock issuance (hertz)? New stock issuances create a higher supply of shares and in turn, pushes the price down as new shares hit the market. Then you have bankruptcy, which effectively wipes out the lower portion of the totem pole (shareholders). In summary, just because they get back to “normal” long term, there are issues they can pick up on the way back to “normal” that can affect the balance sheets of these companies far past the timeline of recovery. The risk is uncertainty. I think anybody who decided to buy these distressed companies at the March lows would have done a lot better in investing into reputable companies that took a beating.

{"title": "What every WSB Autist should know about DGLY and AAXN before morning trading opens", "selftext": "Ok Chickenfuckers, listen up.  I like chx tendies just like the rest of you and volatility in an artificially propped up market has been great for me just like it’s been great for some of you.  The hot topic this week appears to be Police bodycams!  Who are they?  When will they?  And when will we turn our FO into not MO?  Well, let’s dig a little deeper and go on a Magic School Bus (the short kind) style educational adventure to learn all about our current situation.  Like they say in Mexico:\n\n“Oyo anque se pollo!”\n\nNow, in the past 24 hours there has been a lot of fuss about a potential Executive Order to be signed on Tuesday, June 16th of this week.  Trump and the Whitehouse refuse to comment on the possibility of a future Executive Order on police reform; However, we have some partially substantiated rumors none the less.  Let’s take a look at what those rumors are.\n\nThe best source I can find on what Trump’s Tuesday do brings us is S. Lee Merritt.  Merritt is an attorney representing a number of families whose loved ones have been killed by police officers.  Merritt is expected to star alongside Trump and Attorney General William Barr for Tuesday’s possible Executive Order signing.\n\nSo what does Merritt think is going to be in this Executive Order, faggot?!  Good question, let’s take a look-see:\n\n1. Statement acknowledging a minority of officers misusing their authority, causing mistrust in different communities especially the Black community.  (This is fluff but obviously necessary for him to say out loud.)\n\n2. An order to establish a national certification and credentialing system for law enforcement agencies.  (Kind of surprised this isn’t already a thing, but ok.)\n\n3. An order to create a federal database to track Officers accused of wrong-doing or excessive use of force.  (Again, this isn’t a thing already?  Wow!)\n\n4. A directive to the secretary of Health and Human Services to work on encouraging police departments to involve mental health officials when dealing with issues of mental health, homelessness, and addiction.  (This is a fluff but sounds nice!)\n\n5. A directive to encourage Congress to pass legislation related to policing.  (This, again, carries no legal weight and although it sounds nice, is just fluff.)\n\nWow, 5 things is a big list!  Most of you blanket sucking pillow biters have probably already drifted off, dreaming of the tender kisses of your Wife’s BF, or at the very least are wondering why I am telling you this.  The important thing is #5, because just last week the Democrats and the Congressional Black Caucus introduced the Justice in Policing Act. This bill, (not a FUCKING LAW YET RETARD,) would: ban police departments from using chokeholds, develop a national standard for use of force, limit the transfer of military weapons to police departments, define lynching as a federal hate crime, establish a national police misconduct registry, and limit qualified immunity, which protects officers from lawsuits over alleged misconduct.  There are some other topics in the bill having to do with uniform standards, accountability, traffic and pedestrian stops, detention, racial distribution of drug charges, use of deadly force, data collection, transparency, police training, and the transfer of military grade equipment to State and Local Law Enforcement.\n\nOh, and the Bill includes one other thing.  This is what has all of your misinformed dicks real fucking hard:  The bill would also require **federal uniformed Police Officers** to wear body cameras, and mandate all marked federal Police vehicles have dashboard cameras.\n\nDid you catch that?  This Bill that has not yet been voted on would make requirements for Federal Police Officers to have body cams and dashboard cams.  Trump’s announcement tomorrow is rumored to be an Executive Order that has a directive to: “encourage Congress to pass legislation related to policing.\n\nOk, now let’s get to the fun bit.  You fucking cucks have been blowin’ your load in the first 8 seconds of Belladona’s infamous baseball bat in the ass scene before it even got to the good stuff.  Well give your balls a tug, because we’re about to dive a little deeper and enter into the alternate universe where tomorrow’s announcement and possible EO signing was something more than a PR stunt and somehow managed to demand body cams for every living thing in the USA by next week.  Here we go:\n\nOk WSB, DGLY duckling and AAXN (no longer the ticker symbol for Anthrax Attacks) have spiked immensely in popularity here over the past 24 hours.  Let’s investigate why.  Both of these companies are publicly traded!  Wow, that was fast.  That is all the research necessary for finding out why these two tickers are popular in this sub.  There is literally nothing else.  When the search for things to invest in becomes a mad scramble to find anything available, you end up tonsils deep on your Wife’s BF’s cock trying to decide whether you like deep throating dick-veins or are just gay-for-the-stay.  Let’s now move on to the next subject which happens to be the question of what might happen to these 2 stocks if tomorrow actually meant every croc and gator in the FL panhandle was legally obligated to wear a bodycam.\n\nWe’ve already covered why body cams will not become a Nationally mandated accessory for all Police forces in the USA at 10am EST this morning, but let’s have a bit of fun with a thought experiment…\n\nSo, bodycams and dashboard cams are a market with a lot of potential but also a lot of competition and currently, not as much interest as is necessary to float the supply.  Please search top bodycams of 2020, search for the past few years and you will see, publicly traded companies are not making the best body cams.  Well, why does that matter?  In public Police departments (I am talking all police departments now, not just the federal officers that if Trump says a certain thing tomorrow would be unaffected by it but if then the House and Senate passed a certain Bill into law would at some pint in the next decade finally end up with bodycams from the lowest bidder) there is not a widespread use of cameras.  In fact, only one quarter of State/Local departments use bodycams.  To make matters worse, the way that departments decide to pick bodycams in not logical, backed up by actually data, or based upon whether a particular camera functions well in the field.  Well, why does this matter?  When departments do limited orders on something and equip their officers with it, the officers have to crash test the efficacy of the equipment.  Feel free to trawl through the massive amounts of data on the internet where officers hash out the details on different pieces of tactical gear.  What you may quickly notice is that all the bulletproof vests and handguns and magazines and belt loop attachment whatever-the-fucks have a lot of coverage on forums and the like, yet bodycams do not.  Would you like to know why?  Well, only 25% of departments have bodycams, the vast majority suffer from both physical and technical issues, they are too clunky or too light or have a clip that doesn’t hold them on well or the BIGGEST PROBLEM:  firmware and software issues, companies refusing to warranty clearly defecting bodycams (this problem is rampant with DGLY!)\n\nOk, so I’ve told you that this mornig AT BEST pokes legislators with a stick to make something happen in Congress where only FEDERAL OFFICERS are required to wear bodycams, and I’ve told you that bodycams are unknown territory and often shit, but let’s talk about DGLY and AAXN specifically.  I have provided a couple of links and some graphics in this post to make things easy for you, but for telling you how shit DGLY is I won’t bother, you can find it on the first page of Google results.  Officers HATE their bodycam.   It’s straight up garbage.  AAXN does not get as much hate, but still suffers from the issue of not honouring warranties and being bulky.  Listen, Police Departments nationwide are still in the early days of navigating the bodycam universe.   Bodycams are still in early days.  This shit ain’t even been around a decade.\n\nWhy so many words to read?  Ok, Faggot, I make this simple for your wittle simpy brain: Go look up top bodycams of a recent year.  Here is a website doing top bodycams of 2020: [https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-body-camera](https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/buying-guides/best-body-camera)  Did you notice anything strange?  Well, if you can believe it, neither DGLY nor AAXN have bodycams on the list.  The list has a lot of cams from Boblov (Shenzhen Lvyouyou Technology Co. Ltd.)  A chinese company?!  must be garbage!!  Not so, they have a lot of highly lauded cameras and optics in production and a proven track record.  Ok, so why haven’t I heard of them?!  Well retard, they are not traded on a US stock exchange.  You are currently looking at a successful privately owned company, which is essentially the origin story for every highly rated bodycam on the market.  To use Boblov as an example, this brand has been making hunting optics and golf range finders for ages.  They have an endless supply of quality (cheap for them) camera and recording components, and they have the highest rated bodycams on the market!\n\nWell okay, this sounds like the lead-in to a big gay orgy where we all drink the blood of some obscure animal we’ve never heard of, what’s the point?!  Good question!!  Obviously at this point I can’t save anyone who has read this far and said FUCK THIS SHIT I’LL BUY.  But, I can still save the forever ‘tards that buy on impulse.  I know you idiots are real excited by the concept of tomorrow being a big pump for DGLY….  Let’s explore the possibilities.\n\nThis stock is an absolute trainwreck and I honestly don’t know why it’s publicly traded, it must just be to make money for anyone that gets nepotized into the board of directors.  Would you like to know what insider trading has happened recently?  Well, on June 9th of this year, their CEO Stanton E Ross and their CFO Thomas J Heckman sold their insider stock:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x2pj2gl2y9551.png?width=1304&format=png&auto=webp&s=825438890797f78f2c138537382dfd28075156b5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you not convinced?  Don’t worry, because I know you’re wondering what happened to this company’s stock back when the Ferguson Riots happened in 2014.  Basically, there was a lot of rioting in 2014, the stonk price went up, Obama said something should happen, and on Sept. 21st, 2015, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the department of justice had disbursed more than $23million in bodycam grants.  In the year 2015 Donald Trump was calling for federal subsidies of bodycams, however he has more recently gone the other way on that particular topic.  Interesting to note:  the stock price of DGLY spiked when the rioting started in 2014…   But look where it was when the bodycam subsidies were announced:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o7l12o85y9551.png?width=1138&format=png&auto=webp&s=f753f73641c76b721e6fa08a2f1c1a4fb19d6f0f\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAre you perhaps beginning to see the correlation between investor opportunity and overvaluation?  Why not look at the whole of the company’s performance?  Can you see anything worth investing in?\n\nOk, now let’s talk about AAXN.  Unlike DGLY, this company is not a one trick pony with shitty bodycams.  In fact, this is the company that has the Taser on lock down!  This company fucks and they have been doing quite well.  Their bodycam is not well respected, but they crush on the Taser game no doubt.  This is a major disparity between AAXN and DGLY, DGLY is just a shite company trying to make bodycams, AAXN is a proven company that turned the so-called “non-lethal” police game on its head.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/izvvsy6dy9551.png?width=1306&format=png&auto=webp&s=9febd1eb06004abb9aad28a850cb34322a01e6d2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is the play here?  Well, if I have somehow managed to talk the retard that don’t do any research out of YOLOing calls on these two companies that’s great!  You have 2 plays here.  Option 1:  sit on your cash.  Option 2:  Buy stock in AAXN even though you clearly missed this pump:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8xpbfg5gy9551.png?width=1294&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f70cd93c322262bb93274e816ca41022811c346\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut wait, I don’t understand option 2, aren’t AAXN at all time highs and the majority of their muh-muh-money comes from Tasers not body cams?!  That’s right!  You should buy their stock IN A FEW MONTHS WHEN IT’S NOT AT ATH YOU FUCKING MORON.  Then, sit on it for a few years and see where you’re at.\n\nI will personally not be bothering with either of these pieces of shit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPosition:  Holding Cash\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: DGLY and AAXN are already pumped, you missed the pump, this morning’s announcement is not going to make them moon fuckface.", "id": "ha42kq", "created_utc": 1592314362.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "> know before morning trading opens\n\n> waits to post until after trading opens", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "XD GUILTY!

{"title": "How to make money in Kangaroo Town", "selftext": "**Warning: This is not financial advice, I'm retarded.**\n\nAll right retards listen up, I'm frankly disgusted by the bitching and moaning I've seen on here the last week. You fomo'd into puts at the bottom, and then into calls at the top. Every step you make is the wrong one, and there's a secret back door in your computer that tells the fed which direction to make the stonks go just so that they can personally fuck YOU of all people, the guy with $300 left from the $20k you had back in January.\n\n\nWell you're in luck! The King of Kangaroos is here to teach you to recover successfully from a rug pull, and how to negotiate that loss into some tendie sauce.\n\n\n\n**Market Background Information**\n\nLook around you. This market is easily the most fucked pile of steaming garbage the world has ever seen. Zoom, a video conferencing app, has almost the same valuation as Goldman Sachs, a hedge fund; a company that has not built a single product skyrocketed to 23B market cap (lookin' at you NKLA); and Boeing has both made and broken countless autists in the last month. \n\n\nQuit trying to out think the market, its more retarded than you are. You will lose. \"The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent\".\n\nInstead set your self up for success by profiting off of the fact that no one knows what anything is worth, which will be reflected in the prices every day. \n\nHere's a quick little taste of what I mean. Yesterday (Monday) I noticed that SPY had a gap down to the lows of last week, followed by full day chugging upwards back to $307. \n\n\nClearly people could only tell its price to +-$5, and thats going to be reflected at open, so I open the following positions yesterday right before market close when SPY is sitting at $307:\n\n2x BTO SPY 315C @1.12 per contract\n\n2x BTO SPY 300P @2.81 per contract\n\n1x BTO VIX 35P @2.50 per contract\n\nTotal cost of position (without trading fees) is $1036, however you could half this by buying only 1 call and 1 put.\n\nWhy did I do this? Im clearly bearish (we saw a 5% dip last week, why not this week?) so half of my position is supporting my bear thesis, but I build myself a hedge on both a gap up as well as volatility falling through the floor rendering both sides of my strangle worthless. My hedge is roughly the same price as my thesis, so I should be ok no matter what happens at open.\n\n\nFast forward to this morning at 9:30. Market gaps up to $315 for some ungodly reason, who tf knows, but clearly my bear thesis was absolutely wrong for today! Am I fucked? No! I exit my hedge immediately as follows:\n\n2x STC SPY 315C @ 4.00 per contract\n\n1x STC VIX 35P @ 3.60 per contract\n\nTotal is $1160, so I've already made $100 dollars on the confusion of others, I've covered my whole position so the only thing left on the table is play money, and I still have the rest of the week to look for an exit. Even if I exit the Puts for $1.00 each that's still another $200 profit AND ALL I DID WAS RIDE THE DELTA, but instead I will likely look for an opportunity to average down the cost of my puts, and try to exit the other side for a profit or break even.\n\nLook, this type of strategy will only be viable for another week or so, in reality as long as volatility remains high (which is anyone's guess really), so be careful trying to recreate this trade. \n\nBut keep it in the back pocket for the next time a rug pull happens. Don't hold onto those losing positions, but don't panic sell either. Kangaroo town will provide a few opportunities for you to minimize loses on your positions, and once you exit, grab yourself a straddle/strangle position, and ride that delta wave until a new trend emerges.\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/E1pCttb", "id": "ha6us7", "created_utc": 1592323512.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "I tried to read all of this but, my wife's boyfriend is playing call of duty with the volume on max.
