{"title": "August 5th Alerts from My AI Options Tool | MELI, MSFT, TDOC, SRNE, TWTR", "selftext": "So we've done pretty good in the last week and in yesterday's alerts with multiple alerts panning out really well e.g **$NVAX (yesterday), $SQ (yesterday), $NKLA (yesterday), $KNDI, $NFLX. $PDD** etc. I also posted a [detailed spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fT2P9JKxmnyZFFXEOl9QWBsqAqzTwYi-UXSPJ2InECw/edit?usp=sharing) with results from the last week. We had an accuracy of **75%** last week. **6 out 8 alerts panned out yesterday as well giving us the same 75% accuracy.**\n\nThe tool is still very new so please be careful with all the alerts. **I would recommend paper trading these for a few days and doing your own DD as well**.  The overall accuracy is around 60-70% which means it can make mistakes.\n\nBullish  means the stock is expected to move up more than 1% from the current   close at least 1 day in the next 1-5 days. Bearish means the stock is    expected to stay the same or go low in the next few days.\n\n# Bullish Alerts\n\n**$MELI** \\- Bullish probability of 86.19%. Really like the setup here but maybe wait for another dip before getting in. 1 hour chart has been respecting the 20 MA ([https://i.imgur.com/hbmZCom.png](https://i.imgur.com/hbmZCom.png)).\n\n**$MSFT** \\- Bullish probability of 83.44%. As long as it can stay above the $212 level, seems like a decent setup but please be careful. There is a gap down that needs to be filled.\n\n**$FMCI** \\- Bullish probability of 78.97%. Bearish pressure has kind of cooled down now. The tool expects this to go up now.\n\n**$TDOC** \\- Bullish probability of 74.74%. Excellent stock. I would however wait for a dip before entering.\n\n# Bearish Alerts\n\n**$GME** \\- Bearish probability of 89.50%. Went up today but did not close well. Let us see how it does. It broke the moving averages so I will be a bit careful.\n\n**$DAL** \\- Bearish probability of 89.09%. Don't see airlines getting a ton of momentum until there is a vaccine.\n\n**$TWTR**\\- Bearish probability of 85.09%. ***Only*** get in if this breaks the 50 MA because this stock usually respects the patterns it has been following ([https://i.imgur.com/8pTUgXk.png](https://i.imgur.com/8pTUgXk.png)).\n\n**$SRNE**\\- Bearish probability of 81.94%. **Very risky play**. The tool got it wrong last time but it keeps assigning bearish direction to it. Let us see how it goes.\n\n**Note:**   A lot of time has gone into these tools and it takes time to write   these alerts, look at    charts, and post them here. Would love for you   guys to **try out our** [https://discord.gg/HAabKT](https://discord.gg/HAabKT) **channel** where I post alerts from various tools, not just the  options one.

However, I recall reading an explanation of the wiring of the pedals in a Tesla, that each pedal uses multiple sensors, that encode information in the signal they send to the processor so there's no possibility of confusing which signal the pedal came from, with multiple sensors for each pedal that send signals so the sequence of pressing can be confirmed, and that the signals from the pedals are recorded in the black box, so they could not be spoofed by a software problem.\n\nTesla posted a comment on this topic on their blog at [https://www.tesla.com/blog/no-unintended-acceleration-tesla-vehicles](https://www.tesla.com/blog/no-unintended-acceleration-tesla-vehicles)  on January 2, 2020:\n\n*\"...We investigate every single incident where the driver alleges to us that their vehicle accelerated contrary to their input, and in every case where we had the vehicle's data, we confirmed that the car operated as designed. In other words, the car accelerates if, and only if, the driver told it to do so, and it slows or stops when the driver applies the brake.*\n\n*\"While accidents caused by a mistaken press of the accelerator pedal have been alleged for nearly every make/model of vehicle on the road, the accelerator pedals in Model S, X and 3 vehicles have two independent position sensors, and if there is any error, the system defaults to cut off motor torque. Likewise, applying the brake pedal simultaneously with the accelerator pedal will override the accelerator pedal input and cut off motor torque, and regardless of the torque, sustained braking will stop the car. Unique to Tesla, we also use the Autopilot sensor suite to help distinguish potential pedal misapplications and cut torque to mitigate or prevent accidents when we’re confident the driver’s input was unintentional. Each system is independent and records data, so we can examine exactly what happened.*\n\n*\"We are transparent with NHTSA, and routinely review customer complaints of unintended acceleration with them.

If you don't agree, that's fine - these are my observations and of course, I might be incorrect.\n\nDon't take a random degenerate's word for it. Do your own DD.\n\n**Financials**\n\n* ADBE reported an EPS of $2.45 last fiscal quarter\n* Their outlook is an EPS of $2.40 next fiscal quarter\n* Next earnings are scheduled for September 15th, 2020\n* PE ratio = 48\n* Short float is 1.01% and short ratio is 1.08, so pretty low. Not expecting a big short squeeze here\n\n**Chart Pattern**\n\nADBE's chart pattern (daily) looks like a symmetrical triangle, volume is decreasing since the start of that triangle. A symmetrical triangle is a consilidation pattern after an uptend. Decreasing volume is a good indicator of consilidation towards the end of that triangle. There's a high probability of breaking out of that pattern on the upside and continuing that uptrend.\n\nMoreover, $ADBE touched, but stayed above the 20 EMA the past days, which is a good sign. The MACD looks like it's about to reverse as well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wnm1hx4jg5f51.png?width=2113&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f4494051f444c4f8387f685bc6cdee4a6c8424b\n\n**Positions and Target**\n\n**$ADBE 9/18 450C**\n\nI opened this position since I don't open positions more than 1 strike OTM to reduce risk.

{"title": "DIS: the Moon Mission", "selftext": "First, this is a mid to long term play, so if you are looking for overnight money, go somewhere else to lose it.\n\n**Conclusion: ATH (>150) this year. Likely to start trade at 200 by year end. 420 possible within 3 years.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDetails:\n\nWhy DIS is the best pick now:\n\n1. If virus continues, Disney + subscription and revenue (and other streaming like Hulu and ESPN) will keep on increasing --- DIS will be viewed as a growth / tech stock.\n2. If virus has a vaccine / treament, park / movie revenue will be back.\n\nSo essentially DIS is the safest play now no matter the virus outcome.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpcoming catalysts (from this ER call):\n\n1. Disney parks are net positive even at 50% capacity.\n2. Disney has hoarded 23B cash on hands!\n3. DIS is spending 1B to restart its movie production, and will add more contents to Disney +.\n4. Mulan will appear on Disney + as premium access for 30 dollar.\n5. Disney will keep expanding its streaming to more countries, and hold an investor day in next few months to update its Disney + target. (The original target is 60-80M by 2024, and they already achieved 60M now!)\n\nSo company is very healthy, way healthier than many expected. Bottom is bounded, while Mulan on Disney + will increase its subscription and Q3 earning significantly. We could be looking at 80M subscription, and 1-2B additional revenue / earning just from Mulan by Q3 end. More contents throughout Q3 / Q4 for DIS +, and investor day in Q4 could finally wake investors up about DIS potential.\n\n**If all these catalyst works, DIS price will easily recover to 150 by September, and may start to trade above 200 or so by year end.**\n\nWildcards:\n\n1. More movies (like Tenet) and future Disney movies to also appear on Disney + as premium access: CEO said Mulan on Dis + is planned as a one-time thing. But if virus continues, or Mulan doubles their earning than a traditional movie release, I am sure they will consider debut all future blockbusters on Disney +. And if Disney can convince more blockbusters to join Disney + with some revenue share? DIS to the moon.\n2. China market. Disney is the most recognized media company in China. Despite China being strict about foreign movies, if there is one streaming company that may come to China, it will be Disney +: most of its movies were in China theaters, and Disney Shanghai is a success so far. So Disney has a perfect platform for streaming service there. Whereas Netflix may never be allowed in China market. If Disney + ever enters China, it may add 100-200M subscribers!\n\n**If both pan out in 1-2 years, stock has a chance for 420 by 2022-2023.** DIS tripled from 2011-2014, and basically flat since then. The next 2-3 years could be the time it triple again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, I know many may say it does not make sense for stock to ATH while its revenue / earning is below the previous levels --- but look at NVDA, APPL, TSLA. They all ATH, doubled, tripled. But their revenue is flat or do not increase much, and earnings is just a few cents (Yes TSLA!). Future growth is all that matters. **A company with strong moat, solid fundamental, and big growth potential, and it is at multi-year low?! Buy the dip. DIS right now is just like NVDA below 160, APPL below 200, and TSLA below 300.** All bad news are priced in. And DIS only has good news and strong catalyst going forward --- maybe a fast rise is coming, or a slow and steady rise thoughout this quarter, or stagnant for a while then rise before Mulan debuts, who knows.\n\n**My buying strategy: stock is a great deal now (yes even after a 10% rally the past hour). Buy and hold so long Disney + growth story is intact.** Ignore any small up and down volatility. If you must, buy leap call with affordable premium. Don't buy weekly call because MM can always rape weekly holders. If you would like to try your luck on monthly calls, try September - December ones.\n\nPotential short-term issues: If Mulan is a flop (unlikely), or Macro somehow sucks again from now to year-end (also unlikely but possible with election coming up). Stock will be ok but option holders be aware of these situations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy track record: I only post when I am 90% confident of my predictions. One only needs 1-2 good play a year.\n\n1.
