Panasonic will add another line, increasing capacity by 10% to 39 gigawatts-hours per year.\nThis is the first capacity expansion at Gigafactory since it opened in 2017. Panasonic is also upgrading the batteries being produced at Gigafactory, raising each battery's storage capacity by 5%, starting in September.\nThe investment marks an easing of tensions between the two partners, whose relations have been rocky since spring 2019.

The California company, co-founded by billionaire Elon Musk, is about to start mass production of its Model Y sport utility vehicle. Tesla is also fielding many orders for its new Cybertruck pickup, which was unveiled in November last year.\nMusk cited limited battery production as a challenge to growth in a news conference on July 22.\nThere were earlier plans to boost output at Gigafactory, with the two companies in 2018 hoping to eventually boost capacity by 50%. The plan never came off, as Model 3 production hit a snag.\nThe spat between the two companies went public after Musk tweeted that battery supply had become a constraint on Model 3 production.\nToday, Tesla enjoys strong growth in sales and earnings, and both sides seem content. \"This is not the time to worry about making major investments,\" a Panasonic official said.

{"title": "[$NVDA] Trying to make an educated guess on NVIDIA's earnings after close", "selftext": "I wrote this shit up to rake in some €uropoors so I could feed my cat just to realize you can't instantly publish random shit on Seeking Alpha (the site did it's best to cause that impression) so here we go:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nFollowing a series of either positive (Ampere) or at least interesting (ARM) news, NVIDIA's stock has run as hot as it can possibly get over the past few weeks, almost climbing as high as $500 a share.  NVIDIA will report their earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 today after the bell. This report will define whether or not the very ambitious valuation of NVIDIA is - for now - justified or not. Let's attempt an educated guess at the numbers they're going to report tonight.\n\n**Data Center - $1900M**\n\nThe data center segment has been the major growth driver for NVIDIA since late 2016. Back then, they reported $240M revenue for Q3 of fiscal 2017. This boosted the stock by 50% in a matter of weeks. Since then this segment has been under close observation by analysts and NVIDIA has been aggressively growing it as much as they can. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang is saying that data center is now a $100B market and expects it to grow to $1T in the coming years. Last quarter NVIDIA reported a record $1,141M data center revenue. Their new superstar AI-accelaretor, the A100, already contributed to that quarter, yet it was still very new to the market. According to their last report the A100 will have solid visibility in Q2. Almost more importantly, starting with Q2, data center will incorporate Mellanox revenue, which was $429M last quarter. This means that had Mellanox revenue already been included last quarter, NVIDIA's data center revenue would already have surpassed their revenue from gaming. [In a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY61ExKhnfA) NVIDIA demonstrated the construction of Selene, the world's 7th fastest supercomputer. [Their A100 dominated AI benchmarking against competitors.](https://siliconangle.com/2020/07/29/nvidia-sets-16-new-performance-records-latest-mlperf-ai-benchmarks/) The strength of the A100 combined with the inclusion of Mellanox' revenue should skyrocket their revenue from data center up to almost $2B.\n\n**Gaming - $1600M**\n\nThis quarter will be the last one of the Turing generation. You'd think that consumers would be aware of that fact and that they'd be reluctant to buy any hardware that will be obsolete within weeks. Yet demand for Turing cards, fueled by covid, has been very strong. Despite the release of NVIDIA's next high end card being a matter of weeks if not days, people are still buying used (!) 2080 tis for $1000 and above. The 2070 super ($500-600) has seen high demand and competitor AMD has not managed to make much of a dent in NVIDIA's revenue. Buyers of the RX 5700 XT reported serious driver problems, further confirming NVIDIA as the brand you go for if you want things to \"just work\". Moreover, NVIDIA has built 2 more USPs in DLSS 2.0 (AI upscaling) and RTX Voice (AI noise cancelling) in this quarter to which competition has no answer yet. Consumers describe these features as \"black magic\" and the premium for RTX cards is finally being accepted. Big graphic intense game releases such as Microsoft's Flight Simulator and Cyberpunk 2077 (delayed but upcoming) further helped demand for gaming GPUs. In Q2 of FY 2020 NVIDIA reported $1,313M revenue from gaming, a number they should handily beat this quarter.\n\n**Automotive - $120M**\n\nLast quarter, revenue from automotive came it at $155 million which was the lowest number since quite a few quarters. NVIDIA is by no means giving up this segment, they are determined to becoming a major player in the self driving car revolution. In June, they announced a close partnership with Daimler. Starting 2024 [every single next-gen Mercedes-Benz](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/06/23/mercedes-benz-nvidia-software-defined-vehicles/) vehicle will include hardware and software from NVIDIA. While this is a great outlook, it does not help the upcoming earnings release a lot. Due to covid, NVIDIA expects revenue from the automotive segment to decline by 50%. The recent success of Tesla is helping NVIDIA in this sector, as Tesla has successfully been applying pressure on the \"dinosaurs\" of the car industry. As Tesla is building their own hardware and software for their autopilot, traditional car makers have fallen too far behind to catch up in time and have to rely on partners like NVIDIA to survive.\n\n**Professional Visualization - $340M**\n\nRelative to the rest of NVIDIA's business, ProViz has been growing very slowly, but yet steadily. What speaks against strong numbers from their ProViz business is that Turing is on it's way out. The same was the case 2 years ago with Pascal and yet NVIDIA reported a solid $281M revenue in this segment. Combine this with the fact that covid has been boosting demand due to heavily increased home office working, a solid increase in revenue can be expected.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThese guesses add up to a revenue of close to $4B. NVIDIA's guidance for this quarter was $3.65B. If this attempt at a guess of NVIDIA's revenue ends up being correct, the stock's current valuation would gain strong support. There are more factors that could come into play tonight. Play close attention to any of the following:\n\n* Any information regarding a potential purchase of ARM from SoftBank\n* Guidance for H2 data center revenue\n* A potential announcement of a stock split\n\n**Tl;dr**\n\n*  NVIDIA's business has been thriving under covid. \n*  The A100 is a masterpiece. \n*  The Mellanox acquisition is materializing. \n*  Demand for Turing cards for gaming is stronger than you'd expect. \n*  Therefore I'm expecting total revenue of around $4B.
