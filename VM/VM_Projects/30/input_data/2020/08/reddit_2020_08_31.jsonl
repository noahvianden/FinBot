VGT’s huge allocation to these two increases its Beta, meaning steeper gains and losses. \n\nThanks for bringing up VGT to my attention. I frankly overlooked it.

Actually it went up about 12% today because people like you buy tesla now because it SEEMS more affordable now. Tesla is at an all time high and it could go 2 ways: shareholders like me are waiting for tesla to rise due to the split and then sell which means tesla will fall OR it will continue to rise because tesla is an unpredictable bitch right now. Tesla itself (its factories and assets) are nor worth what their shares make it seem. So you can invest and hope for it to continue rising or you can wait and hope shareholders sell their shares, the prices fall and THEN you buy it lower.
