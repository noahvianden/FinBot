{"title": "Somebody explain how the stock split works with shorts, and the last week of August", "selftext": "**EDIT:** (as with most things, my understanding of this process was completely wrong, please refer to top responses below rather than taking my bad explanation as truth)\n\n**Original Post:**\nSo this is not an actual stock split, but rather a dividend to be paid to the \"stockholder of record\" on 8/21. The dividend will be distributed after close on 8/28, and trading on the split-adjust basis begins on 8/31. \n\nWill the value of TSLA not plunge during the last week of August? If you hold a share on 8/21 and sell on 8/24, you will still get your four dividend shares at the end of the week. Conversely, if you buy a share on 8/24, it better be super cheap, because it's the only share you're getting--you don't get the dividend. Right? So, knowing that, it seems like the share price (and market cap) should drop by 80% starting on 8/24, and the market cap will rebound to previous levels on 8/31 with the appearance of the new shares.\n\nNow how does this work with shorting? Doesn't a short sale create a situation where there are essentially two owners for one share? There is the original owner (who I believe is the owner of record, he'll be expecting his 4 share dividend to show up on 8/28); the person who is borrowing that share and sold it short; and the owner who bought the short--who will ALSO be expecting a 4 share dividend, right? When you buy a share on a trading platform, there's no indication of if it's a \"real\" share or a \"short\" share, right? So won't there be two people expecting the dividend off of a single share?\n\nMeanwhile, what is stopping the short-seller from closing out his position on 8/24, after the value drops, but while the stock is still officially trading with the current pre-split number of shares? He just has to cover his one short share and get out before close of trading on 8/28, right? \n\nI clearly don't understand this strategy and impacts of having a full trading week between the benchmark for the dividend, and the distribution of it. Someone enlighten me!\n\n**Edit:** u/PM_ME_UR_Definitions has generally cleared up my misunderstanding with his explanation of \"Due Bills\" and how any trades made in the last week of August come with the understanding that they include a due bill for the four dividend shares once they are distributed. This was not explicitly called out in Tesla's press release, which lead to my confusion. So the 21AUG date is essentially transparent to everyone, the only thing that matters is that trading resumes after the split on 8/31.

Of course I didn't do a quick Google search to verify.. cause earnings are actually 8/19.
