(AAPL) recently announced a 4-for-1 stock split. The split takes effect on August 31 for shareholders of record on Aug. 24. The stock split happens automatically in your account and you are not required to do anything. TD Ameritrade does not charge a fee for this type of a stock split.\n\n\nIf you own shares of AAPL before market open on Aug. 31 you will own four shares for every one you hold, and the stock price will be reduced to one-fourth of its value at the start of trading on Aug. 31. For example, if you hold 100 shares of AAPL trading at $400 per share, after the split you will own 400 shares valued at $100 per share. Likewise, if you own one options call with a strike price of $400, after the split you would own four contracts controlling 100 shares each, at a $100 strike price.\n\n\nIf you sell AAPL shares after Aug. 24 but before Aug. 31, you will sell them at the pre-split price. You will not be entitled to the split shares. For example: If on the last business day of trading AAPL, Aug. 28, you sell 300 shares for a pre-split market price of $400 per share, you will receive $120,000. You will not receive any split shares.\n\nIf you buy shares after Aug. 24 but before Aug. 31, you will purchase shares at the pre-split price. Following the split, you will receive the additional shares resulting from the stock split. For example: If on Aug. 26 you buy 100 shares (and hold them through the open on Aug. 31) at $400 per share, you will pay $40,000. You will receive 300 additional shares after the stock split, and the price will be reduced to the post-split price...”", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I read this three times and I'm still missing what changes on August 24th.

This gives them an offline presence. Also, you can print the QR code for free and then display it wherever. You don't need electricity to power the it. It also cost the merchant less in fee's for each payment compared to a regular POS terminal. \n\nMerchants all across the world, from garage sales, to small kiosks in 3rd world countries, all the way to stores like CVS across the US will be able to take payments using a QR code and your phone.\n\n**2)** Venmo monetization. Whenever people talk about Square they're quick to mention the Cash App. It's great, I'll be the first to admit that. But I personally believe that all of the features they have that Venmo doesn't are catalysts for Paypal moving forward.\n \nVenmo and Paypal are already planning to add the ability to buy and sell bitcoin soon. Keep in mind that Paypals userbase (325 M as of last Q) is significantly higher than Cashapp or Robinhood. If they can provide bitcoin transactions and the additional services of those apps, they would truly be a juggernaut in the fintech space. \n\n**3)** Consumer Rewards - There's talks about some sort of Paypal key that would allow users to get additional cash back or rewards (on top of your credit card ones) when you purchase using Venmo or Paypal. I haven't looked too much into it, but there are some good articles to read if you search for Paypal key. They also bought Honey last year and the CEO talked about plans to use it on the last quarterly call.\n\n**4)** Moat (of sorts) - I agree that paypal doesn't have some amazing  contract or something that purely seperates their business apart. But what they do have is an incredible brand recognition.

Because no one wants to enter their credit card information into a site that they don't know. But they do trust Paypal, and Paypal can act like the middle man in thousands of these transactions every minute.\n\nLast but not least, they just had their best quarter ever.

Last year they acquired Ethoca (managing e-commerce fraud) and Vyze (platform to connect merchants with multiple renders, giving them the opportunity to get those financial needs for start-ups).

They are already working on ways to implement cryptocurrency and Mastercard tend to have more growth potential vs stability from market leader Visa.

{"title": "Be careful selling puts, something fishy is lurking ...", "selftext": "Theta gang works until it doesn't. I've been doing a ton of reading/webinars, what not and came up with the following info:\n\nThe SPX is valued like any stock, with a PE ratio. The PE ratio gives you a 12 month trailing growth rate. \n\nSo a PE of 20 on Apple means you expect Apple to grow 20% in the next year. In order for a stock to rise you need to have growth in earnings. \n\nThe historic PE ratio over the last 100 years is 15. This means that, on average, you can expect a 15% growth YOY in SPX. \n\nHere are historic PE ratios of SPX:\n\n1980: 12 multiple\n\n1990: 18 multiple\n\n2000: 25 multiple\n\nAs you can see, the SPX PE ratio has been expanding but when you look at earnings, they haven't expanded that much. So how does the ratio expand?\n\n1) Stock buy backs creating a fake increase in the multiple\n\n2) low interest rates\n\nWhen you factor in inflation, the average PE for SPX 1950-1980 is 18. At some point the multiple gets out of control and you correct down\n\n\nWhen the market crashes, the multiple contracts and usually goes to the average, somewhere around 15. A 'ridiculous' multiple is not sustainable when you can't have growth, thus, you are overpaying. Earnings matter and valuation matter, but they don't matter on the way up because JPOW is manipulating interest rates and liquidity (duh, we all know this). However, in the long run, they always matter but only on the way down.\n\nJPOW killed the bond market, which is less risky and equities. Since the yield is higher in SPX, money is flowing in like crazy. However, should the bond market recover, money will flow out of the equities and back to the safer product. \n\n**Aug 2020 PE ratios**\n\nNasdaq: 37\n\nSPX: 35\n\nDOW: 28\n\n**Aug 2019 PE ratios**\n\nNASDAQ: 24\n\nSPX: 22\n\nDOW: 18\n\nA year ago the economy was fantastic and these multiples were considered expensive.

The market as a whole seems to be viewing this as a temporary setback, that business will return to normal sooner rather than later (not saying I totally agree, just saying).  \n\nIf the market is right, and things will return to normal, then it is perfectly reasonable that pe ratios should be high accross the board.  Earnings are low, but the market is forward looking to when earnings will be high again, which is assumed, and the current price of stocks reflect that eventual return to form.  \n\nThe tricky sector is tech.  Tech has done well during the pandemic, so the earnings have not been as downtrodden as other sectors.  This creates a different situation, though.  You have a sector that is outperforming the market in general, and when that happens one should expect a higher pe ratio.  Tech is the obvious choice and so it should command a premium over sectors that trail it.\n\nYour assessment of what pe ratio is in the beginning of your post is a faulty premise in general, by the way.
