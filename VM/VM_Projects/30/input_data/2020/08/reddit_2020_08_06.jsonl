And who manufactures all of these CPU's and GPU's?\n\nTSMC.\n\nThese products are so hyped everyone's gonna buy one or the other from the items above. You'll be asking why these products weren't released when lockdowns were first issued. Lockdown will be voluntary after these products are released.\n\nFace value TSMC's market price (NYSE: TSM) may seem priced in, overvalued, or whatever the fuck you gay bears come up with but I'm telling you this shit is gonna skyrocket by the end of 2020. And I don't give a fuck if Huawei is out of the question.  Any idiot knows that TSMC  has a fucking monopoly on the rest of the CPU/GPU manufacturing market. TSMC spoon feeds NVIDIA, Apple, AMD, and etc all their CPU/GPU demands. They're literally pushing Samsung out of certain deals.\n\nOh right I forgot about the autists. Let me explain.\n\nTaking an example outta the CPU side of things,\n\nX86 is the type of chips that AMD and (the late) intel produce. X86 is the current most dominant and powerful type of  computing chip widely accessible to consumers. You've all heard of Nvidia buying ARM or some shit. ARM is a \"prospective\" type of chip good for low-power consumption. It hasn't been developed enough to produce the same computing power as X86 yet, but in the future it will. In summary, ARM is good because ARM is good for saving power consumption and battery life.\n\nApple uses ARM patents in their Iphones and shit, and ARM basically has/will dominate the mobile devices market. Ipads, Iphones, Ipenis, you name it.\n\nSome people say ARM will replace X86 someday. Who fucking knows.\n\nBut on the manufacturing side of things, ARM, just like X86, is just a manufacturing LICENSE in its essence. It's just a bunch of design drawings. ***Actually*** MANUFACTURING these CPUs and GPUs is so expensive and so complex that practically only two companies can supply and meet the material demand **licensing** companies such as AMD, Apple, and Nvidia ask for. That's TSMC and samsung. And samsung is too gay to trade on NYSE/Nasdaq.\n\nPoint is, all of the incredibly hyped CPU and GPUs of 2020 and in recent years which everyone will buy will be coming out of TSMC in 2020. Oh, and TSMC is also future proof so just  go ahead and buy 10,000 shares and 400 calls.\n\nThank me later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: Go all in on TSMC short and long term.", "id": "i4xq9o", "created_utc": 1596740033.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "I only know TSM not TSMC", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "Literally googled dafaq is tsmc", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Morningstar (total bear on this) calls it that", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Buying the wrong stock is a winning strategy", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is one of 5-7 stocks that I've been holding for the last few months and plan on holding long term.
