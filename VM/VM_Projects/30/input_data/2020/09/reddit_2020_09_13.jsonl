We already know there is a risk ARM will be successful in the high performance space. That has nothing to do with this deal.

They would want to be able to pick the best product in the moment rather than lock themselves in and just switch from $1000 Xeon to $1000 ARM.\n\nThis has long been priced in (at least on Intel's end) since Intel trades at a P/E of 9 or something.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "*\"ARM's \\[...\\] co-founder says it’s ‘a disaster’.\"*\n\n*\"Hermann Hauser, has warned that the deal is not in public interest, warning it will result in U.K. job losses and a lack of competition.\"*\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/arm-co-founder-nvidia-deal-is-disaster-for-cambridge-uk-europe.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/arm-co-founder-nvidia-deal-is-disaster-for-cambridge-uk-europe.html)", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Well that's incredibly misleading, Herman Hauser is Arm's co-founder, not Nvidia's.
