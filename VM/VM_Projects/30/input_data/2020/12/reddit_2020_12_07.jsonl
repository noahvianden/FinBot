{"title": "Boomer Stock Recovery Play: Coca-Cola", "selftext": "**TLDR; Coca Cola is still 10% below its pre-covid high.  It should go even higher.**\n\nFor the 8 of you still reading, I present to you a somewhat neglected stock hurt by Covid that hasn't fully recovered, but also one whose February high of $60 is not a ceiling.\n\nYes, Coca Cola has had a decent run from it's $36 March lows and is even up 12% since October, trading about $54/share as of Friday before pulling back a bit this morning.  It's not done yet.  Let me provide a few reasons why.\n\nTo understand where we're going, let's look at where we've been. Here's a 5 year chart.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[5 year performance of KO: courtesy of CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/4lmb773xnl361.png?width=1538&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e426700a92d40cd64e6d58994cb5f330a9b8658)\n\nThe stock has been of a bit of a snoozer until it began to awake from its slumber about 2018, which accelerated through 2019 and then Wall Street really started to like it in 2020.  It had upward momentum, upset by Covid.  This momentum will return, very soon.\n\n**Catalyst:  In Person Dining**\n\nWhy will momentum return?  Most importantly, vaccines will return restaurants back to normal operations by summer 2021. The restaurant industry has been in total carnage.  Independent restaurants are closing permanently every day, with large chains taking market share.  BUT - those that are still operating are living off of Off-Premise consumption.  IF people get drinks to go, they get one.  No refills.  This has depressed an entire major sector of Coke's sales.  As restaurants return to normal, they'll have more customers, and existing customers will be consuming more cokes per sale than they are now.  That's a double re-open win.\n\n**Catalyst: Cutting overhead like a mo-fo**\n\nThere's more to this story.  Coke has used Covid as an opportunity to cut costs and streamline operations.  They've cut employees and overhead expense - [more than 1/3 of their North American employees](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/08/28/coca-cola-says-layoffs-buyouts-likely-part-restructuring/5654218002/).  They've cut a lot of niche product that had overhead burden and marketing/distribution expense but had little revenue, much less profit, [like Tab.](https://www.beveragedaily.com/Article/2020/10/19/Coca-Cola-discontinues-TaB-diet-soda-in-the-US)\n\nThey're going to come out of this a leaner, more focused company.  They may still have an old and sleepy brand image, but they're also a cash printing machine, and they're going to be printing even more tendies to share with us.\n\n**Catalyst: Falling Dollar**\n\nBut wait! There's more!\n\nCoca Cola generates [roughly one third of its revenue from North America](https://www.statista.com/statistics/271136/coca-colas-revenue-distribution-worldwide-by-operating-segment/).  That leaves the balance subject to currency fluctuations.  With the dollar tanking, [those foreign profits are going to be worth even more.](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/how-us-benefits-when-dollar-falls.asp)\n\n**Not Priced In**\n\nLooking at the [CNBC.com](https://CNBC.com) earnings helps demonstrate that the street has not priced in the recovery, much less the benefits from restructuring and currency.  The company itself has not been providing guidance as they have no more visibility than we do how the almost random shutdown/reopen orders will happen.  They did, however, [warn that Q3 would be hampered by currency exchange rates when the dollar was strengthening](https://www.barrons.com/articles/coca-cola-stock-is-rising-after-earnings-heres-why-51595335348), the opposite of what is happening now and projected to continue for a bit.  How did Q3 end up when the currency was facing headwinds?  They beat the street consensus by 18.8%, and were just one cent per share less than a year ago - when unemployment was at a record low and everything was \"normal\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Coke's Earnings Trend - CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/34xwla91jm361.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=15d64af9e6559ac5d1bb1e8bf1cc76f77e8f219b)\n\nBased on the same CNBC data, the street is projecting that one year from now, after restaurants are fully operational, after the company has completed a worldwide restructuring that will eliminate 1/3 of its North American employees, and after the benefit of a presumed lower dollar, the company will just be earning 3 cents more in Q3 and Q4 2021 than it did in 2019, pre-covid.  Again, this would say that reopening their fountain sales division to normal levels is only worth 4 cents per share from this past quarter when much of the country remains shut down.  That seems low.  Too low.\n\n**Benchmark: Starbucks**\n\nWhat's the upside here?  I'm using Starbucks as the benchmark.  They're both beverage companies, though Starbucks is clearly more of a direct restaurant play, and more of a pure play on China's reopening - which is far ahead of the US's and the rest of the world's economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Starbucks One Year Performance - CNBC](https://preview.redd.it/ifebi0x2tl361.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=606fe19138dfcfc86ff139b105225bc1b2dab23b)\n\nStarbucks hit a high of about 93 in January, as Covid was already gripping China.  It then fell and rebounded to about $90 in February before beginning the March market swoon.  On the way back up it kept bouncing into that $90 level (frustrating the hell out of me holding $90 calls) before finally breaking through on the way to all time highs, now at $102, almost 10% above the January highs.\n\nLooking at a similar pattern (though KO held on longer before a much quicker descent) I would expect KO to test $60 soon, and probably bounce off a time or two before breaking through.  Again, based on prior momentum I would expect once it clears $60 it should easily run up another 10%.  The market will quickly recognize when they reopen they're going to have more operating leverage than when the shutdown began, and they're going to start seeing currency gains as soon as this quarter.\n\n**Benchmark: Pepsi**\n\nPepsi is probably viewed as Coke's more direct competitor.  Coke had been outperforming them over the last 3 years until the Covid dip.  Pepsi, more diversified because of its snack businesses, was the better stay at home play.  Coke has a decent catch up trade remaining.\n\n[3 year performance Coke vs Pepsi: Barchart.com](https://preview.redd.it/x6eb2dahfm361.png?width=2326&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d74d592426a18cfc7be54f10f760bc19dd8fd53)\n\n**Strategy:**\n\nSugar water doesn't get stock analysts excited any more than WSB casino patrons.  For that reason, I would not be looking at any FD's.  This one needs some longer dated options.\n\nI want to get past the next earnings on 1/28 for evidence of the currency lift to begin to show, but the country will likely still be in winter Covid shutdown mode so I'm not sure we'll get guidance then based on restaurant openings.  I'm also feeling like mid-January/February could be a bit rough after a lights-out November and a presumed Santa Claus rally at month's end.  Keep some powder dry to buy this on dips. I am.\n\nI'm thinking there's a three-prong approach here.\n\nFor the first taste, February 55 calls.  Relatively low risk (only slightly OTM), gets us a few weeks past the next earnings date when we should at least see a currency boost, but also captures any run up as the market starts to figure out there's still reopening meat left here to take off the bone.\n\nI'm going to put the heart of the play into June 60 calls.  The country should be mostly vaccinated, restaurants should be back to near normal.  Hopefully this will be telegraphed by the April earnings call.  If this gets priced in sooner...[Vega is your friend.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k7eto7/you_trolls_are_in_desperate_need_of_understanding/)\n\nFor a stretch, going to throw the balance of the play into leaps for Jan 2022 65's.\n\nI'm starting this position with $5K.  Because I expect a decent dip sometime Jan/Feb, will hopefully have some dry powder on the sideline to increase these positions if I've been too early on this move.  But as we've seen with many of the reopening plays, when the market decides it's time, I don't want to be late....or any later than I already am.\n\n**Positions:**\n\nPurchased this morning at open:\n\n[Act fast and you can get in cheaper than me!](https://preview.redd.it/lue5o4nv0s361.png?width=2160&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f22cbbe69ebe65c11018fb332745685773fd84b)", "id": "k8ht7i", "created_utc": 1607352154.0, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "Good DD, bought PLTR instead and got my money stuck in a toaster", "score": 73, "replies": [{"body": "Check the toaster.

{"title": "This is the way to play Tesla (up 55.8% TODAY with this dumb strategy!)", "selftext": "Elon Musk says we need to double the world's electricity by 2040. How is that going to happen--Solar? No. Wind? No. \n\nThe only way to ramp up base-load capacity so quickly is more natural gas, coal, or nuclear plants.  Natgas and coal are out because they aren't green. Nuclear is the best option.\n\nHere's the quick and dirty DD:\n\nTo get nuclear plants going, we need to mine uranium. Uranium stocks have roofed the last two trading sessions because congress just passed a bill to start a US stockpile of the stuff for national security purposes. The scramble to get mines operational has begun, but that's only the trigger that will set off a much longer rally based on industry-specific factors. \n\nThe fact is, the world is set to go into a decade-long drawdown of uranium inventories. Despite the Fukushima disaster last decade, nuclear capacity will continue to grow year after year, but mines aren't keeping up. That's going to set the price of uranium soaring, from around $30 per pound today, to $50 or even more, so that mines actually get paid to produce.\n\nUranium mining companies like Cameco (CCJ in the US exchange and CCO in Canada) are levered to the price of uranium, so that when the uranium price rises, the stock prices rise even more. And with options, idiots like us at WSB can be levered on top of that leverage. The daily gains can be explosive. \n\nThat's how I made 55.8% today: options on CCJ. See the screenshot. A good chunk of these options were out of the money when I bought them, but now they're all in the money. What can I say--sometimes the idiots at WSB do win! I should have bought even further out of the money, like CCJ 14 Jan 21 calls, given the pace the underlying is currently moving. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xtck2tbemt361.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=bab84530589236a3225b9443cbdb815a3de2041e\n\nTL;DR: buying call options in CCJ is for people who believe in Musk but want to park their TSLA gains in something with more upside.", "id": "k8odde", "created_utc": 1607371795.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "This has big $VALE energy and my dick’s getting confused", "score": 30, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "WSB in 10 years is just gonna be boomer holdings", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Like honestly I’d buy calls on this theory.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "The fact that MSFT and Google AmZN were once risky picks. \n\nThat X, PFE, Johnson , KO were the true boomer. \n\nRemember true boomers bought bonds, any stock was considered a YOLO. \n\n\nBuffett was the OG YOLO all in on Geico / Coke and fucking ketchup, and ice cream. \n\nKeep in mind during 80s recession people had trouble putting food on the table, and my guy went “fuck it I think everyone needs some ice cream and coke”. \n\nHe invested in fucking soft drinks.

{"title": "Implied Volatility for Autists", "selftext": "I'm sharing excerpts from two books on options - \"Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings\" & \"Options Volatility & Pricing\".  I actually read these books but found the sections on volatility most useful.  The goal is to inform about why you should stop providing liquidity for those who got in early and start understanding what the price of an option is communicating to you.  Buy low sell high in options means implied volatility.  What is 99 on a scale of 1-100?  \n\n**Volatility**\n\nWhat is volatility and why is it so important to an option trader?  In a sense, volatility is a measure of the speed of the market.  \n\n\nTypes of volatility:\nfuture volatility, historical volatility, forecast volatility, implied volatility, seasonal volatility (commodities).\n\n\nTo help the new trader understand the various types of volatility, consider the following analogy to weather forecasting.  Suppose a trader living in Chicago gets up on a July morning and must decide what clothes to wear that day.  Do you think he will consider putting on a parka?  This is not a logical choice because he knows that historically it is not sufficiently cold in Chicago in July to warrant wearing a winter coat.  Next, he might turn on the radio or television to listen to the weather forecast.  The forecaster is predicting clear skies with temperatures around 90F.  Based on this information, our trader has reached a decision: he will wear a short sleeve shirt with no sweater or jacket, and he certainly won't need an umbrella.  However, just to be sure, he decides to take a look out the window to see what the people outside are wearing.  To his surprise, everyone is wearing a coat and carrying an umbrella.  The people outside, through their clothing, are implying completely different weather.  What clothes should the trader wear?  He must make some decisions, but whom should he believe, the weather forecaster or the people in the street?  There can be no certain answer because the trader will not know the future weather until the end of the day.  - Options Volatility & Pricing\n\n\nVolatility comes in two basic stripes: historical and implied.  Historical volatility is also called realized volatility.  It refers to an objectively calculated formula that measure the standard deviation of an underlying instrument.  Implied volatility refers to the volatility implied by the price of the option.  The value of an option is calculated by a somewhat complex formula that includes several fixed variables such as price of the underlying instrument, strike price of the option, time until expiration, dividends, and cost of carry, as well as moving variable - the volatility of the option.  But if we know the price of the option, as we do for everything that trades, we can then work backwards and calculate an implied volatility of that option.  An implied volatility represents the best guess of the \"market\" of the volatility of the underlying between now and when the option expires. - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings\n\n\n**Volatility Characteristics**\n\nIf we were to generalize about volatility characteristics from the Deutschemark volatility in [Figure 14-2](https://imgur.com/a/SZjt2oa), we might surmise that an underlying contract is likely to have a typical long-term average, or mean volatility.  Moreover, the volatility of the underlying contract appears to be mean reverting.  When volatility rises above the mean, one can be fairly certain that it will eventually fall back to its mean.\n[Notice](https://imgur.com/a/jjasHg2) that the fluctuations in implied volatility are usually less than the fluctuations in historical volatility.  When the historical volatility declined, the implied volatility rarely declined by an equal amount.  Because volatility tends to be mean reverting, when historical volatility is above its mean there is a greater likelihood that it will decline, and when historical volatility is below its mean there is a greater likelihood it will increase.\n[We can see](https://imgur.com/a/KyYUgVs) that with a great deal of time remaining to expiration, the future volatility of the underlying contract (the solid line) is relatively stable.  but as we get closer to expiration the future volatility can become much less stable.  This is logical if we again recall that the mean reverting characteristics of volatility are much less certain over short periods of time than over long periods.  One large move in the underlying contract with only several days remaining to expiration will result in a sharp increase in the volatility to expiration (14-9C).  On the other hand, if the underlying contract is relatively quiet over the last several days in an option's life, the volatility to expiration will collapse. - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings\n\n\n**How do Traders Trade Volatility?**\n\nIf you are being chased by a bear, what is the key to getting away?  An old adage says that you don't have to actually outrun the bear, you simply have to outrun at least one person who's with you.  Volatility in the S&P 500 averages about 20 over the course of history.  But let's say you buy a one-month option at a 40 volatility.  If realized volatility over the course of the month exceeds 40, you likely made money on the trade.  Or at the very least you made a wise decision owning options instead of stock.\nVolatility serves as a proxy for the amount of money available in the options pool.  The deeper the pool, the greater the premiums.  For sellers, the better the price they receive and the wider the range of stock with which they can profit.  For buyers, all they care about or should care about, is whether realized volatility of the stock itself will prove higher than the volatility they paid.  An 80 volatility implies that the average day will see a 5 percent move (80/SQRT of 252) (252 trading days in a year).  Well, actually, it implies that two-thirds of the days will see moves under 5 percent and that one-third will see moves above and beyond that.  \nAs a general rule, net selling options at a higher volatility than they ultimately realize will prove profitable.  Likewise for net buying options at a lower volatility than realized.  One thing to do is ignore anyone who throws numbers out trying to \"prove\" how much better you have it selling options compared to buying them.  This tells an incomplete story. - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings\n\n\n**The VIX**\n\nThe time is 1993.  Bill Clinton is inaugurated.  The Buffalo Bills lose their third straight Super Bowl and run headstrong into a 4th.  The World Wide Web begins.  Nirvana releases \"In Utero.\"  And the VIX was born.  The goal?  To provide a handy estimate of the implied volatility of a 30-day at-the-money option on the S&P 100 Index, also known as the OEX.   By 2003, the S&P 500 supplanted the OEX as the most popular index.  So on September 23, a new VIX was born that had a new underlying index, SPX, and a completely new methodology. - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings\n\n\n**They Don't Hedge What You Think They Hedge**\n\nThe Vix estimates the implied volatility of an ATM option in SPX with 30 days of duration.  A regular option on the SPX estimates the volatility of SPX itself between today and the day the option expires.  Say it's May.  You're looking at November options in SPX, and they trade at a 25 volatility.  That is the volatility the market anticipates between now and November expiration.  \nA November VIX future?  Quite different.  That's an estimate of where the VIX will close on November expiration day.  So if in May, you buy or sell a VIX November future or option, you are simply betting on where the VIX will settle on the morning of November expiration.  A common misconception is that your bet is on volatility between May and November.  Wrong.  It's a bet on a single snapshot number that one day.  And since the VIX itself is an estimate of volatility 30 days forward, a May transaction in a November VIX contracts bets on where the market six month's hence will estimate volatility 30 days forward from there.  \n\nOh, and did I mention that VIX futures and options close on a different day from regular futures and options?  Yes, they expire 30 days ahead of the next month's regular expiration, which makes sense in a way since the VIX itself estimate the price of a 30-day option.  The problem is that we have some four-week cycles and some five-week cycles, so that puts VIX expiration on either the Wednesday before or the Wednesday after regular expiration, depending on where regular expiration one cycle out sits.  Confused?  You are not alone. - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings\n\n\n**What Can the VIX do for You?**\n\nIt can tell you an expected range in the underlying index, the SPX.  Remember though that is a probability, not a guarantee.  Market volatility expectations reside at the intersection of two factors: volatility of the component stocks and the degree to which they correlate.  The volatility surge in mid-2008 has as much to do with increased correlation as anything else - specifically, energy imploding alongside everything else. - Options Volatility Trading: Strategies for Profiting from Market Swings\n\nTLDR: no", "id": "k8stou", "created_utc": 1607385396.0, "score": 57, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "thats crazy bro, ill grab some more pltr and hedge with pltr calls", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "PLTR doesn't have much historical volatility to reference since its new.
