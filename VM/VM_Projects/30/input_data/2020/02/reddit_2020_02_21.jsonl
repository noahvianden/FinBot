Imagine if AMD can nail mobile processing power and make a deal with apple to have Ryzen powered macbooks (since they already run their GPUs)?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks man I like your attitude.\n\nI’ve seen some stuff saying Nvidia realized that their high end cards were pricing themselves out of the market and were planning on cutting prices on the next gen. 3XXX is going to be insane and I can’t wait.\n\nIf AMD rolls integrated graphics into their chips or  comes up with a chipset with a GPU on board I think they’ll take the entire consumer CPU market from Intel. I haven’t heard of any plans to do that in the next couple of years. This isn’t an Intel diss-track - they’re doing good stuff like quantum computing research, heterogeneous computing, making data enter GPUs, etc - so they have plenty of other sectors to be profitable in if it comes to that. Also they likely have tons of contracts that extend for several years that will keep them buoyant and a very deep war chest.\n\nI hope AMD ups their GPU game, because someone needs to compete with Nvidia. From the looks of it that isn’t going so well at the moment. This is not a stock market thing as much as it is a consumer thing.\n\nAlso, I think TSMC manufactures the silicon for both AMD and NVDA. They have earnings in March. Not sure how they’ll respond to the virus nonsense.\n\nWe’ll see how it goes. I think we agree the futures are bright for those companies, but there may be some chop on the horizon through Q3.

(which it should be by now)... then it will force A LOT of ppl to upgrade. \n\nwithout amd releasing gpus in this power range to compete (their only 1080ti like card is the radeon vii), i see nvda pricing high (cos of supply and demand issues) and then when a competitor comes (amd), they will price cut and supply will be better then too. \n\n\ni dont think amd can compete with nvda. development cycles for gpu tech take years. its just the reality that AMD's development cycle for their current gpu tech was not as good as nvdas. they have less money etc.etc. so its obvious nvda already had an advantage. AMD MIGHT be able to pull the rug from NVDA in a couple of years time but not now.\n\nalso the sooner we over the 4k/60 hurdle, the sooner nvda becomes a little less relavant in the gpu market. \n\natm if u have 4k/60.. u go nvda. and 4k screens and plentiful. thats where amd falls short imo. \n\nbut then nvda are listening to consumers and adding exclusive features. if RTX grows into a thing... then amd are gonna have to either forget about it or try to compete. nvda are also copying AMD's features so fast and making them better. like image sharpening.. nvda's implimentation works for more games and allows in game customisability. they even basically added freesync. and they partnered with lg for their oleds to support vrr... nvidia just keep making good decision after good decision.. its scarey. \n\n\n\n\nbut i like AMD cos their processing power on offer is ace. they are making 16 thread processors.. like a normal thing. you can pretty much be a professional video editor with a budget ryzen cpu now :D\n\n\nmy question in my mind is do i buy an RTX 3080ti or buy £1000 of nvidia stock and buy an RTX 3080ti in 6 months time using my nvidia stock :D hahah", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Yeah, I bought a MSFT $200 4/17 today for dirt cheap.

{"title": "Micron Technology (MU) DD", "selftext": "This used to be a memory commodity company that made money hand over fist in the good times then lose money hand over fist in the bad times. Que Sanjay Mehrotra, or papa Sanjay as the cool kids call him. This is a guy who founded Sandisk, turned it into a memory powerhouse then sold it to to Western Digital for 19B. Once he left Sandisk, WD lost market share where Sandisk had once dominated. Coincidence?\n\nSo crappy Micron decided to hire Sanjay to steer the headless ship. From May of 2017 when he took over, MU was under $10. 3 years later, it’s at $57. Coincidence?\n\nOK, so enough screwing around. Here’s what you’ve came here for:\n\nThe memory trough has finally bottomed. Micron did not lose money. How do I know it has bottomed? Earnings from other tech companies. They have been investing in data centers because the new hot technology is AI. Artificial intelligence require massive CPU, memory, and storage. Magnetic disk is so 1980’s, it’s all about NAND today. Who makes the hottest NAND? Intel and Micron collaborated on 3D XPoint (think Intel Optane). It’s 1000x faster than NAND, last 1000X longer, and 10X as dense. It’s basically not volatile DRAM, something to power the AI revolution.\n\nOh yeah, Micron just bought out Intel’s share of 3DXPoint for 1.5B. The only manufacturing for 3DXPoint is in… Utah. That’s right, not in China! So now I segue into the Mexican Beer virus. The majority of memory manufacturers are centered in the Wuhan area. The Wuhan area is basically shut down for the foreseeable future. Hmmm… which memory maker makes memory mostly outside China? If you said Micron, you win the prize. They have manufacturing locations in Idaho (you da hoe), Utah, Virginia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Xian China. They have only one location in China, and it’s not even in Wuhan.\n\n[https://siliconangle.com/2019/01/15/micron-buy-intels-stake-3d-xpoint-joint-venture-1-5b/](https://siliconangle.com/2019/01/15/micron-buy-intels-stake-3d-xpoint-joint-venture-1-5b/)\n\nFB, Microsoft, Google, all the trillion dollar company are in a datacenter building frenzy, and they need memory and storage. NVDA and AMD are readying Ampere and next gen Navi this summer. Each card is getting a minimum of 8GB. Guess who makes GDDR6? It’s Micron. The last time Micron had blow out earnings it was due to bitcoin miners. But this time, it’s legit demand, straight from the corporate overlords The #1 demand for GPU is no longer games, it’s datacenter and supercomputers for data modeling and AI. The demand is going to go through the roof and the beer virus has made Micron one of the few suppliers with its manufacturing base outside of the Wuhan area with the technology to feed the insatiable demand.\n\nOne last piece of data, Micron is no longer a memory only company. They are evolving, and has expanded into proprietary technology. DRAM has steadily went from 75% of their sales to 70%, while NAND went from 21% to 25%, and other is at 5%. What is this 5% you ask? It’s automotive. Think TSLA. These cars basically have a proprietary CPU/GPU board that uses AI to steer the car. Now, what’s the one thing AI needs? Memory. Papa Sanjay has seen ahead and has developed an automotive group. TSLA leads, but Toyota, BMW, and all those other laggards are following right behind. 80 million cars sold annually and they all will need fast memory to power self driving.\n\n[https://www.micron.com/insight/on-the-road-to-full-autonomy-self-driving-cars-will-rely-on-ai-and-innovative-memory](https://www.micron.com/insight/on-the-road-to-full-autonomy-self-driving-cars-will-rely-on-ai-and-innovative-memory)\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/01/07/1967523/0/en/Micron-and-Valens-Demonstrate-Industry-s-First-In-Vehicle-Remote-Centralized-Storage-Solution.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/01/07/1967523/0/en/Micron-and-Valens-Demonstrate-Industry-s-First-In-Vehicle-Remote-Centralized-Storage-Solution.html)\n\nMicron is going into growth mode as a tech company by creating propriety solutions with higher margin, no longer just selling commodities. They have even open up a Silicon Valley campus for this purpose. Micron is going into the high margin high growth business, but their PE is still low due to their history of boom and bust business cycle. Since their shares are still so cheap, the company has even set aside $10B from cash flow to buy back shares. Lower share account plus higher price to earnings mean the Micron could be a multi bagger for the foreseeable future.\n\nI thought Summer is when they blow it out, but datacenter build-outs and Corona virus epidemic means everything has moved up a quarter. I expect excellent forward guidance. There’s usually a two week run up to earnings for Micron, but since the market has dumped two days in a row, here’s a chance to buy it cheap 4 weeks before earnings.\n\nTLDR: Buy 4/17 60 or 65 calls if you’re autistic. Why 4/17? It's for the run up afterward. If you have a long term horizon and gay, buy shares. I’m autistic and gay.\n\nProof:\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/0u8k3je](https://imgur.com/a/0u8k3je)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: David Tepper increased his holdings of MU at the end of last quarter by 2,000,000 shares to 8.1m shares.
