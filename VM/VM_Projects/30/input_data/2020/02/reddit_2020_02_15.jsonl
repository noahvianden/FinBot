That said, here are large privetely owned forests - actually small plots with different owners, but nonetheless in large contiguous areas - which have been used for centuries for wood production. In a well-managed forest, you usually  cut a number of trees at once, but you pick them in a way that maintains a tree population of various ages and species all over the forest. You would, if possible, wait for good wood prices, then pick some old big trees which block light to smaller ones for harvest. If the smaller ones stand rather dense, you might also harvest some of them to let the remaining ones grow better. \nThere were some areas which were reforested, e.g. some unused farmland, forests destroyed by hurricanes, or in the case of the Black Forest, the so-called \"Franzosenhiebe\" (\"French clearcuts\") where French occupation troops after WW2 harvested all trees for timber, often in square areas of several hectares. In the 1980s, the Franzosenhiebe were still clearly discernible from the surrounding forest, but even then they looked way more like a healthy forest than that tree plantation in Grünheide.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "They are a group close to our fascist right wing party AFD.

A Tesla plant is to be built on the site. \n\nHü and hott around the construction preparations for the new Tesla plant in Brandenburg. On Saturday morning the forest was cleared, in the evening it is already over again. For the time being.\nOne minute.\n\nThe Higher Administrative Court (OVG) of Berlin-Brandenburg has temporarily halted the ongoing clearing work on the site for the planned Tesla factory in Grünheide. This was in accordance with an application by the Green League Brandenburg, the court announced on Saturday evening. (Az.: OVG 11 S 8.20) The environmental association together with the Association for Landscape Conservation and Species Protection in Bavaria (VLAB) had failed on Friday before the Administrative Court of Frankfurt (Oder) to prevent the tree felling work with urgent applications.\n\nAccording to the OVG decision, the stop now ordered will apply until the Green League's appeal against the Frankfurt decision is decided. The advanced clearing work made it necessary to temporarily prohibit the tree felling work, as it could be completed within another three days. According to the OVG, it is also not to be assumed \"that the Green League's request for legal protection is obviously hopeless from the outset\".\n\nThe Administrative Court, on the other hand, had ruled that the weighing of nature conservation interests by the State Environmental Agency was not objectionable. The tree felling work could therefore be continued. (VG 5 L 69/20) Promptly they continued on Saturday for the time being. Since Thursday afternoon, the heavy machinery had been working its way bit by bit on the 90 hectare site. Trees were felled and the trunks were sawn into pieces about two metres long. The State Office for the Environment had given permission for this ahead of time, although the permit for the construction of the factory is still missing. According to the State Office for the Environment, the 90 hectares or so of land may be cleared; in addition, preparatory construction measures such as the construction of construction roads are permitted. The clearing work on the approximately 300 hectare site is expected to last until the end of February.\n\nObjections may be raised in the approval procedure until 5 March; they will be discussed publicly from 18 March. Only if all requirements are met after examination of the application will a final permit be granted. Starting in July 2021, Tesla plans to produce up to 500,000 electric cars annually in Grünheide.\n\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "The article clearly states that there is no halt.
