Inventory Numbers", "selftext": "Alright autists heres my DD I made up during my 2am adderoll fueled, drunken stumble home from the bar this weekend.\n\nSo I did a quick search in Google, and am now a recession expert. I know for fact that the most important metrics in predicting a recession is unemployment, inflation and (here's the kicker) **manufacturing numbers.**\n\nManufacturing numbers have been trash in the latter half of 2019, but legit this means nothing as these companies can legit just make whatever the fuck they want. Plus like who gives a shit about economic numbers anyway, clearly not the market.\n\nThats why the key to this whole operation is, you guessed it **INVENTORY**. As reporting season is upon us, take a look at the balance sheet and take a look at year over year inventory. If I see this number propped up you can bet your ass I plan on losing another 20k on UVXY calls and SPY puts.\n\nInventory too high, manufacturing goes down further. Manufacturing goes down, unemployment goes up.  Fuck inflation I dont even know what that means. All I know is high inventory means recession is inevitable.\n\n**Non-Retarded Edit:**\n\nIn all seriousness, this is an actual thought and here's why. Inventory numbers are included in the GDP calculation as they are considered an \"investment\" and an asset on the Balance Sheet (Private inventories added 0.65% to the GDP in Q1 2019 alone according to the BEA).\n\nIn 2015-2016 some call it the \"Transportation Recession\" as companies were ordering much less raw materials etc. trying to slowly sell their extremely high inventories resulting in a substantial effect on GDP. As you could imagine, this is particularly important in the auto industry. Selling your inventory = less transportation of materials, less actual manufacturing and by definition, lower inventories will take away from GDP (after a spike in GDP from excess Inventory as described in paragraph 1).\n\nHigh inventories are one of the last steps an economy usually sees prior to a recessionary period. Keep an eye on the inventory to sales ratio as this has time and time again been a lead indicator of a \"recessionary\" period. Not necessarily calling it a recession, but lets define it as an indicator of less than favorable economic times.\n\nAll I am trying to say is high Inventories is/has generally been a precursor to poor economic health.  They play a vital role in both calculating GDP and can act as a signal of future employment levels. Go back and analyze the recessions in the 90's and 2000's (even the great depression) and you can see high inventories have actual as a signal in each of the cases and an indicator of increased unemployment.\n\n**EDIT 2:** We still have a long way to go up. But as earning season (and throughout 2020) this is something I am keeping an eye on as a lead indicator. Will watch the inventory levels on the balance sheets of the countries biggest producers. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan provide details / numbers upon request.", "id": "erju2n", "created_utc": 1579555011.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 39, "comments": [{"body": "You provided no data and we are all dumber for having read the post.\n\nI award you no karma and may god have mercy on your soul", "score": 88, "replies": [{"body": "I second this, but I disagree with having mercy on his soul.
