Could you get more into point 2?\n\nThanks for the details!", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah!  Wall of text incoming:\n\nSo besides having periodontal disease or unchecked caries people can have issues with occlusion.\n\nSo old school dentists are obsessed with something called \"occlusion\" which basically means how your teeth fit together.  Having \"malocclusion\" or bite that is \"off\" is when your teeth do not fit together in harmony.  There are certain points where the teeth \"should\" fit together called  [centric stops](http://what-when-how.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/tmp57204_thumb222.jpg).  There's also an idea that the \"cusps\" or the slanty mountains on your teeth function to help your jaw slide and open your bite so you don't break your teeth.   When the teeth aren't fitting together well you have things called working and balancing interferences where your slanty mountains crash into each other.  You have a bunch of muscles that help move your jaw around as well and how they are attached to your mandible (lower, movable jawbone) help dictate how your mouth and jaw can move and function as well.\n\nThen there's the jaw joint - it's the most complicated joint in the body, you have a knot at the end of each side of the mandible called a [condyle](https://img.medscapestatic.com/pi/meds/ckb/87/20087tn.jpg) which fits into the [fossa](https://www.physio-pedia.com/images/thumb/e/e8/TMJdisc.jpg/500px-TMJdisc.jpg).  When you open your mouth the condyle with the cartilaginous disc rotates open, then slides down a bit to be fully open.  If you put your fingers by your ear on your jaw joint and open slowly you'll be able to feel first the rotation and then the translation of the jaw joint.  When people have popping and clicking in their jaw joint (people call this TMJ - temporomandibular joint, but it's actually TMD - temporomandibular joint disorder) it's when the disc is doing weird shit and not moving properly.  Crunching is bone on bone action.\n\nSo all these things work together to determine your bite, movement of your jaw, how your teeth work together.  If you have ever had a filling and felt like one was a little too tall it's because your teeth are not fitting together well due to the new filling and it needs to be ground down.  Sometimes you see people with their teeth worn way the fuck down basically because when the teeth came in, they came in not great and knocking together for years wears them down.  Teeth naturally wear over time and so does your jaw joint.  Your musculature really wants to be a certain way and your muscles will cause your teeth and your jaw joint to wear until everything fits the way they want them to.\n\nOrthodontists have to take all of this into account when they use braces to align your teeth.  Sometimes people even need jaw surgery because their bite is so whack that braces won't be enough.\n\nSo when you move shit around with smile direct without accounting for the back teeth or for proper occlusion and planning by an orthodontist who has X-rays and calculated angles of your skull and jaw joint in relation to your mandibular angle, etc, you can end up really messing up your bite, cause muscle pain, break teeth, give yourself a good helping of TMD to boot.   It's kinda something that people don't think about until your muscle/jaw joint/teeth relationship gets fucked up and everything starts having issues.

There’s no attachments on teeth and even in their ads, which is very sneaky and pretty messed up, they say they align just the front teeth... which often doesn’t take into account the bite or biology of how teeth actually move which can lead to tooth loss or gum/bone issues, hence some of the lawsuits against them. It’s a terrible ‘service’ since it’s a medical treatment, not just a product. Some dentists and orthodontists don’t actually mind because it’s making orthodontic treatment very mainstream and many people who get SDC probably wouldn’t have gotten regular ortho treatment anyway due to cost, and also some patients go to dentists/orthodontists afterwards to fix what SDC did, andddd some patients just hear about clear aligners because of SDC and once they see all the reviews and litigation against them go to an orthodontist anyway.

They're sinking billions into it for a reason.\n\n* Experts on the EV tech have found that Tesla has a 3 to 4 year lead over all their competitors at the batteries. Tesla's batteries are simply cheaper to manufacturer, and get more range then their competitors (seriously, compare the battery weight and EV range of a Tesla and non-Tesla. You'll find Tesla's get more range then the non-Tesla's when the battery weights are equal). Battery tech is king in EV's, as batteries are the most expensive part of an EV. The inferior batteries of their competitors forces their competitors to either charge higher prices then Tesla, have less range then them, or lose money on each EV sold.\n\n* There's a reason why Tesla is compared to Apple. They simply have a really good brand & product that creates a lot of rapid fans.\n\n* Google the S curve of technological disruption. Essentially history has shown that adoption of new technologies (like smartphones) often **doesn't** follow a linear curve from 0 to 100%. Instead it starts out slow, until it reaches some 'critical mass' point, and then rapidly shoots up exponentially towards near 100% adoption in a short period of time. If you look at a chart of the history of then innovative disruption technologies (like the original automobile, refrigerators, smartphones) you'll see 1) They've all followed this S curve of adoption, and 2) more recent new technological disruptions (like the smartphones) have been adopted MUCH quicker than older technologies were. Due to how expensive cars are, EV's won't be beating the smartphone's adoption rate, but the S curve evidence says that mass EV adoption will likely happen a lot faster then you might think.\n\n* Look up the history of smartphone adoption. Apple created the first one, and had a dominant market share in it at the beginning. As S curve adoption kicked in and new competitors came into the space Apple lost market share (as a percentage of the market), while still gaining a ton new customers. And yet because of their strong brand and quality products, Apple makes something like 80%+ of the profits in the smartphone manufacturer industry. This is why Tesla bulls are confident in Tesla even after competition finally gets here.\n\n* Part of why the stock price is shooting up now is the media is fanning it, after previously fanning the \"Tesla is going bankrupt\" flames the Tesla shorts were pushing.I imagine Tesla will eventually correct itself, but where and down to what, who knows.
