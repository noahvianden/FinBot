Willoughby at [rswilloughby@pomlaw.com](mailto:rswilloughby@pomlaw.com) or 888-476-6529, ext. 7980.\n\nThe investigation concerns whether Wells Fargo and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.\n\nOn April 5, 2020, Wells Fargo announced that it had received strong interest in the Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"), a program under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, and was targeting to distribute a total of $10 billion to small business customers under the requirements of the PPP.\n\nOn April 8, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it would allow Wells Fargo to exceed the asset cap that it had imposed on Wells Fargo in 2018 after revelations that the Company had opened millions of accounts in customers' names without their permission, a change would allow Wells Fargo to make additional small business loans as part of the PPP. On April 8, Wells Fargo also issued a press release stating that \"beginning immediately, in response to the actions by the Federal Reserve, \\[Wells Fargo\\] will expand its participation in the Paycheck Protection Program and offer loans to a broader set of its small business and nonprofit customers subject to the terms of the program.\"\n\nThen, on April 20, 2020, after at least two lawsuits were filed against Wells Fargo, reports emerged that Wells Fargo may have unfairly allocated government-backed loans under the PPP. Following this news, Wells Fargo's stock price fell more than 5% over two trading days to close at $26.84 per share on April 21, 2020. Finally, on May 5, 2020, Wells Fargo disclosed in an SEC filing that \"it has . . . received formal and informal inquiries from federal and state governmental agencies regarding its offering of PPP loans.\" Following this news, Wells Fargo's stock price fell by more than 6% over two trading days to close at $25.61 per share on May 6, 2020.\n\nThe Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 80 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct.

Effectively, some investors believe that the FED is out of its tried and true tools/methods for fighting this economic crisis (and may have to tread into even more unfamiliar waters), and said investors overreacted to what was a muted but not apocalyptically bad FED assessment.

{"title": "Dollar General - Analysis of Operations and Company Summary", "selftext": "**Dollar General – Analysis of Operations and Company Summary**\n\nEarnings May 28th\n\nTL;DR – Overall looking bullish on DG as main customer base becomes more reliant than ever on stretching budgets on essential items during COVID and mass unemployment. Calls on DG; watch WMT (earnings on 5-19) to get an idea of what could happen to DG.\n\nHello WSB; my thesis is that as DG approaches earnings they will be testing all-time highs and that DG proves to be a reliable company during COVID for their value focused customers.\n\nAll of the information that I am sharing with you is found in their 10K statement.\n\nDollar General is the largest discount retailer in America, they have about 16000 stores and operate in 45 states. They strive to offer a broad selection of products at low prices (typically $10 or less). A majority of the customers are value focused and rely on low or fixed income.\n\nMain challenges that DG faces in maintaining low prices are: 1.) trade policy and 2.) receipt of goods offered by DG. \n\n1.)  Historically, DG has shown that tariffs on products from China as applied to direct imports and domestic purchases did not have a net material impact on financial results in 2019. DG believes they can mitigate potential sales and margin impact of such increased tariffs on financial results in 2020 through various sourcing, merchandising and pricing efforts. However, it should be noted that changes in trade policy can result in higher prices for customers which will have a negative impact upon budgets, spending. \n\n2.)  There is limited insight into the extent to which business may be impacted by COVID and there are many unknowns. While DG currently expects delays in the receipt of certain goods in 2020 as a result of COVID, they do not anticipate a material impact to financial results in 2020 due to these delays.\n\nTo support other operating priorities, DG remains focused on capturing growth opportunities. In 2019, DG opened 975 new stores, remodeled 1024 stores, and relocated 100 stores. For 2020 DG plans to open 1000 new stores, remodel 1500 stores and relocate 80 stores for a total of 2580 real estate projects.\n\nDG has paid a quarterly cash dividend since 2015. On March 11, 2020 the Board of Directors announced an increased amount of the quarterly cash dividend to $0.36 beginning with the dividend payable on April 21, 2020. The Board expects to continue regular quarterly cash dividends. Further, DG intends to continue their share repurchase activity in 2020.\n\nThe following information was gathered form the DG website and point to DG remaining resilient during COVID.\n\n\\-  Between March 14th and April 30th DG has hired more than 43000 individuals with thousands of more applicants and candidates going through the interviewing and hiring process.\n\n\\-  An additional $25 million was recently invested to employee bonuses\n\nI see DG testing all-time highs in the coming weeks. All of this has made me bullish on value focused retail stores. A comparable company to watch is WMT, they put out earnings on May 19th.\n\nAdditional food for thought; since 2009 DG has only missed earnings 2 times and has had some pretty impressive gaps up following the day of reporting earnings.", "id": "gj9jjg", "created_utc": 1589409455.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "I could see bad unemployment numbers being good for DG, its sorta their target audience.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "\"Our target market is unemployed people\"", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "They killed it in the 2008 crisis.
