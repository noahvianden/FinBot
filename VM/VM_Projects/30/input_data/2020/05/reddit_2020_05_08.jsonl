{"title": "Cardlytics (NYSE: CDLX), pre-earnings call next Monday night.", "selftext": "**What is** [Cardlytics](https://www.cardlytics.com/)**?**\n\nA small-cap fin-tech company that provides 3rd parties a marketing channel inside apps like Wells Fargo & Bank of America, through consumer cash-back deals. They're also able to provide aggregate consumer spending analytics to those 3rd party marketers as well, to best understand how they stack up against competitors and the macroeconomic landscape. They derive these insights through partnerships with major financial institutions. Cardlytics has data on 1/2 of card swipes in the US. They provide a win for consumers, because they get cash-back deals; they provide a win for banks via profit sharing; they provide a win to marketers through consumer analytics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My CDLX position.](https://preview.redd.it/jgl8q2f4llx41.png?width=997&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c2c7b37ceeeae276a871efe5488f7eaac7d62d1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How has Cardlytics stock fared in COVID times?**\n\nSince their IPO in February 2018, they've shot up - starting at $13 and almost reaching $100 prior to COVID. Now they're \\~$50.\n\nOn March 3rd , the stock fell from $85 to $54. A $30 single day drop. That was after posting *positive* earnings for the first time since IPO. Still, the drop seemed to be related to the founder-CEO leaving... to become Chairman of the Board, among [other leadership shakeups](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/cardlytics-stock-plunges-more-than-25-after-ceo-departure-earnings-2020-03-03).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CDLX chart from Street Smart Edge terminal.](https://preview.redd.it/c08f0976llx41.png?width=1883&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bf04c5b99bb66ac819f1526a9cd0f3667ee4704)\n\nCardlytics ticker in my Schwab Street Smart Edge terminal. Full disclosure, I bought at $65 5/15/2020 call after doing this DD, as you can see on the chart with the green line.\n\n**What drives Cardlytics earnings and how strong is their financial position?**\n\nAccording to their 10K, Cardlytics makes almost all of their revenue off of profit sharing from their consumer deals on banking apps. You can see this detailed on page 39 of their [10K](https://ir.cardlytics.com/static-files/3f393054-6fa9-4ab2-84c9-8a1d53ced724). They've seen strong growth YOY, which makes sense given broader digital trends. 2017-2019, topline went from $147m to $227m.\n\nAlso, Cardlytics financial solvency position is fantastic. They carry $105,000,000 in cash, $37,000 of debt, and \\~$78,000,000 in liabilities. Much of the liabilities are payments given back to their banking partners, making up about 50% of liabilities. In short, they seem to be in a financially strong position.\n\n**How can we expect Cardlytics to fare in COVID times?**\n\nMy guess is, fairly well. They make money off of people buying deals in banking apps. Given mass work from home in America, Amazon and other online retailers increased volumes show that people are sitting at home bored, and so they're buying things online. So why not buy a Kindle and get 20% cash back (see screenshot below)?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My Wells Fargo rewards section, powered by Cardlytics. Screenshot taken 5\\/8\\/2020, showing relevant COVID themed deals.](https://preview.redd.it/k95qvi59llx41.png?width=344&format=png&auto=webp&s=94deb9e887175ef8b3b7d52ef38d36aa5cfb6384)\n\nPrior to COVID, I recall these deals being mainly from COVID-hurt companies - airlines, cruises, theme parks. But it seems they've successfully pivoted and added new marketers to match demand.\n\n**Since the March 3rd, insiders have been buying up CDLX, to the tune of \\~$33,000,000 in net purchases.**\n\nThis is an indication that people within the company thought it was heavily undervalued. Insiders saw a deal and they took it. Source is [here](https://www.insider-monitor.com/trading/cik1666071.html).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[CDLX monthly insider trading stats since IPO.](https://preview.redd.it/qqyf9b0cllx41.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9e6460feb299cf7195b22e1633d87650694fda9)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCardlytics is riding a digital transformation wave, where spend is naturally trending online. COVID is a catalyst to that trend. Yet, it seems the market may have acted irrationally when selling off around March. And so, I'm betting on next week's call being quite positive. Maybe they'll even break the March 3rd gap?

The banks do have longer term contracts with them. If I read their 10k right, I believe they are phasing Wells Fargo in, and they have a 4 year contract with them? Either them or their other FI partners. But they are seeking to add more FIs which will just help their scale immensely. As well, some of the FIs have a fair amount of stock options on CDLX I believe. \n\nTheir ultimate edge though is because they have access to anonymized bank customer data, they literally have the complete consumer profile, on how much they spend, where they spend, how often they spend, and even on what channels these consumers spend, whether it be in store or online. So the ROI metrics and other ad measureables are so unbelievably granular. As a marketer, esp. in this environment where ad spend needs to be hitting maximum ROI, their data seems invaluable.
