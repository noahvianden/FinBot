The rule defines a wash sale as one that occurs when an individual sells or trades a security at a loss and, within 30 days before or after this sale, buys a “substantially identical” stock or security, or acquires a contract or option to do so. A wash sale also results if an individual sells a security, and the individual's spouse or a company controlled by the individual buys a substantially equivalent security.\n\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\nA wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days before or after, buys another one that is substantially similar.\nIt also happens if the individual sells the security at a loss, and their spouse or a company they control buys a substantially similar security within 30 days.\nThe wash-sale rule prevents taxpayers from deducting a capital loss on the sale against the capital gain.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the copy paste from investopedia.  If you read a little farther:\n\n“If the loss is disallowed by the IRS because of the wash-sale rule, the taxpayer has to add the loss to the cost of the new stock, which becomes the cost basis for the new stock.\n\nFor example, consider the case of an investor who purchased 100 shares of Microsoft for $33, sold the shares at $30, and within 30 days bought 100 shares at $32. In this case, while the loss of $300 would be disallowed by the IRS because of the wash-sale rule, it can be added to the $3,200 cost of the new purchase. The new cost basis, therefore, becomes $3,500 for the 100 shares that were purchased the second time, or $35 per share.”\n\nIf the actual price were then to go up to $35 per share, the investor could sell that same asset and according to the IRS they would have made a net of zero profit on the underlying asset.
