This is because if TSLA closes below 207.50, those options are worth nothing on Friday, but if TSLA closes above 207.50, they are worth however much TSLA is above 207.50. So as TSLA moves around 207.50, the value of these options will fluctuate greatly. For every day that goes by, the expected range that TSLA can trade by Friday in decreases, and the value of the calls also drops.
