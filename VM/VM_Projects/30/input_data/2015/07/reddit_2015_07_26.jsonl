It seems like what you're referring to is a short strangle, which would be if he thought the stock wasn't likely to move in either direction.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Not necessarily. You can buy long strangles and they can be profitable if the underlying moves far enough to beat the premium paid.  It's not terribly common, but certainly possible. The thing that makes strangles so tough is that you're buying ATM options, so they're very expensive, meaning it needs to be a pretty big move, even for an earnings move...", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That would just be an ATM straddle wouldn't it? I thought strangles meant you are short the options and straddles meant you were long the options. Otherwise it makes no sense. You are \"strangling\" the underlying and hoping it doesn't move. ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No. I'm on mobile so I can't post pics but a straddle and strangle are different and don't refer to being long/short.\n\nA straddle has ATM strikes.  A long straddle P/L graph looks like a V, with about half the V below the profit line. In other words, the most money is lost on a long straddle if the underlying doesn't move at all.\n\nA short straddle looks like an upside-down V, where you make the most money if the underlying doesn't move. \n\nA straddle is like a strangle with OTM strikes.  A long straddle looks kind of like this: \\__/ with that  flat central part all being loss. It's cheaper than a straddle, but it needs to move further before you make profit. \n\nA short strangle is the inverse of the long. The reason it is called a strangle is because it resembles a garrote, I think.  A short strangle is \"safer\" since it has a larger profit area before switching to loss, but since it sells for cheaper it makes less money than a straddle would.\n\nEither way, its just another example of more risk = more reward.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "No, this is wrong too.\n\nBoth straddles and strangles can be either long or short (i.e. you are either buying a put/call or selling a put/call respectively). But in a straddle the strike price for the put/call are both ATM, and in a strangle they are both OTM.\n\nYou deploy a long straddle or strangle if you think there will be a large change in the stock price but you're 50/50 as to whether it will be up or down. A long straddle is more expensive because the options are ATM, but you don't need as big of a change to be profitable as you do for a long strangle.\n\nYou deploy a short straddle or strangle if you think the stock price won't change very much. With a short strangle you can afford for the stock to move a little further because the options are OTM, whereas with a long straddle you are hoping the price will stay in a very narrow range.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "TWTR and FB seem so difficult to play in my opinion.
