Thanks bro bro\n\n\nI also need to brag for a second. Last night I really dug into the chart. Expected a drop to $60.28 today (60.27 actual), which would put my options at .90c.  The HIGH of the day (so far) on that option was .90, where I had my limit set. Fuck yes. ", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit nice! May I ask how you got your PT?
