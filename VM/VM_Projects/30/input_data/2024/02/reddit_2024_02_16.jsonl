{"title": "5 days to earnings report for NVDA … and today", "selftext": "This is my take .\n\nRSI (Relative Strength Index):\n\nThe RSI is at approximately 73.03, which suggests that the stock is nearing overbought territory. This could indicate that there may be a potential pullback as traders might start taking profits, expecting the price to drop after an extended upward move.\n\n\nMACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):\n\nThe MACD line is above the signal line and both are above zero, indicating that there is still bullish momentum. However, the histogram is showing shorter bars compared to previous ones, suggesting a possible slowdown in momentum.\n\n\nVolume:\n\nThe volume does not show any extraordinary spikes, which suggests there is no significant buying or selling pressure that would indicate a change in the current trend.\n\n\nStochastic Momentum Index (SMI):\n\nThe SMI is in the upper half of the range, indicating some bullish momentum. However, it is not in the extreme, which could suggest that there is still room for the upward trend to continue, albeit with caution as it approaches potential overbought levels.\n\n\nIchimoku Cloud:\n\nThe price is above the Ichimoku Cloud, which is traditionally considered a bullish signal. This indicates that the stock is in a favorable uptrend.\n\n\nBollinger Bands:\n\nThe price is hovering around the upper Bollinger Band but not breaking through it, suggesting that the stock is experiencing upward momentum. However, traders often watch for price interactions with the bands; if the price consistently touches or crosses the upper band, it may indicate an overbought condition.\n\n\nPivot Points:\n\nThe price is above the central pivot point, which can be interpreted as a bullish indicator for the trading session. If the price maintains above this level, it could suggest further bullish sentiment.\n\n\nInterpretation: Given the RSI is nearing overbought levels, traders might excersice caution for potential pullback or consolidation BUT The bullish trend indicated by the MACD and the price position over the Ichimoku clouds and central pivot may still attract for today traders", "id": "1as8tjj", "created_utc": 1708090772.0, "score": 40, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Oh, well the Ichimoku Cloud.

{"title": "Abercrombie is up more than NVDA", "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/opw4dvq9tzic1.png?width=2170&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1dc14112bbae17174fa88603dbae3c8b8342fc1\n\nAbercrombie is +299% in 1y and NVDA is up +231%.\n\nPeople don't realize Abercrombie is essentially a different company than what existed in the 2000s/2010s. In 2017, they hired a new CEO who shifted the brand and product line away from the preppy-dude aesthetic to a different trend.\n\nThat trend is the resale/vintage/thrifting aesthetic — and it's fucking booming. Do a quick search on tiktok to see what Gen Z wears these days and you'll notice they all look like they came out of a fucking Seinfeld episode. This is happening partly because fashion is cyclical but also because Gen Z is just  more environmentally-conscious, so they don't want to see a bunch of clothes end up in a landfill. If you wanna look at the macro, [there's projections that the resale market will reach $70B by 2027](https://cf-assets-tup.thredup.com/resale_report/2023/thredUP_2023_Resale_Report_FINAL.pdf).\n\nThis is why Abercrombie is doing so well — because they shifted their entire catalogue and brand to focus on just this. Other major clothing brands couldn't because they would cannibalize their non-vintage catalogues (i.e. innovator's dilemma). Yes, recently major brands have started carrying vintage-looking clothes, but there's a difference between walking in a store and having to dig for an aesthetic vs everything being the aesthetic you want.\n\nThat's what Abercrombie took advantage of. They were positioned to do it because their brand was already in the shitter. And this is why so many young people shop there these days (seriously look it up on tiktok).\n\nMy position: Bought some ANF 6 weeks ago and I'm up 30%.\n\nEdit: u/___fofo___ called me a big fat idiot because I didn't tell you all before. That's fair. But earnings are coming up March 6. My guess is they crush solely based off how many people I personally know who did Christmas shopping there. But yes, I am kind of a tard.
