{"title": "INTC Outlook and Marketcap vs Assets", "selftext": "Why is foundry for Intel so important, despite only being a minor part of the company?\n\nTheir vertical integration makes both the consumer and server segments highly dependent on foundry. Although the upcoming Arrow Lake processors will be partially based on TSMC nodes, freeing those segments from their dependence, while still keeping all the benefits if foundry becomes competitve again. So long term consumer and server can only benefit from foundry and worst case survive on their own.\n\nWhile 7B losses in foundry and news about Q2 earnings were quite bad and caused this bearish situation. Intel is still on track with foundry for 2024 with 20A and 2025 with 18A and 14A. 18A and 14A will be their first nodes ever, that will be sold over Intel foundry to other companies. Of course foundry is a very hard to ramp up business, that only generates profits in the long term, so investors had too much short term confidence in Intel's foundry business around 2021, that now dies off, before it can even generate it's first revenue.\n\nI am certain Intel CPU's on TSMC nodes will be competitive, especially since intel ordered 3nm, giving it an edge over Amd (1)\n\nSo that leaves two options:\n\n1. Foundry is sucessfull in the next 3-5 years:\n\n=> Intel consumer and server profit from vertical integration and outcompete everything else on the market, while Intel can sell expensive nodes to other conpanies with a high profit margin\n\n2. Foundry is not sucessfull:\n\n=> Intel still profits by producing cheap nodes, for non performance critical parts of SoCs in house while staying competitive in server and consumer using TSMC. For the same reasons some capacity could still be sold to other companies at normal market rates, not turning huge profits, but breaking even.\n\nIntel's Marketcap right now at 30$ per stock is around 130B, while it's net assets are valued at 192.7B.
