Everything is moving to cloud services. Cloud service providers are buying up Nvidia hardware as quickly as possible to keep up with workload demand.  The more chips nvida produces, the cheaper their costs get (sand is cheap and silicon fabrication gets cheaper the more make, they don't need to fab their own stuff and cloud providers are fighting tooth and nail to get hardware.
