{"title": "Tesla Fantasies and Industry Corruption?", "selftext": "I was trying to figure out the reasons for the TSLA runup.  Saw many talking/writing about short squeeze, so-called analysts like Ives talking about robotaxi, others talking about energy, etc.   It's all over the place.  All trying to justify the crazy multiple expansion of this stock.  Most are convinced Tesla will achieve L3/L4/L5 autonomous classification to support robotaxi, as it has been sold to us.\n\nALL of them, I say again, ALL of them ignoring the fact that Tesla cars cannot achieve Level3 certification WITHOUT a backup system, such as LIDAR. Therefore, Tesla will never get L3 certified unless the US state motor vehicle regulators change the laws around this, and I highly doubt it will happen anytime soon. Equally I don't expect Tesla to start adding LIDAR since it would cut into their profit margin.  Assuming that by some miracle they actually achieve L3, L4/L5 is a huge leap forward and required for robotaxi.\n\nI genuinely believe there is corruption that persist here.  Much cheaper to bribe other people (or encourage fan boys) to spread lies throughout the internet about the future of tesla robotaxi fantasy.  I know I sound like a consipracist.

Their CEO, Anthony Noto, is a former Goldman bro, who went on CNBC yesterday and was pumping the stock saying that he's disappointed in how the stock has performed given their performance yada, yada, but then stated that under a Trump administration and in a low-rate environment he expects the company to be re-rated by Wall Street. \n\nThe company has been punished by shorts since its IPO with a nearly 19% short float. I believe that Noto will punish the shorts and we'll see a large move in SOFI incoming with CPI numbers coming in cool again. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/IrxdJwk\n\nOptions are very cheap.
