Time between waves can be a decade or two sometimes. And more ofteb than not, new waves of companies usually take over when this happens and competition starts.

Once a new model is firmly tested and is proven to be good, some company, probably one of the mag7, will start implementing it heavily in applications and raising prices of those applications cuz AI will start trimming positions and people indeed. \n\nThink a company that just tells excel how their accounting model is done and AI can lively deduce day to day issues, excel will ve your own accounting agency, Excel can cost double or triple its cost now if you want the smart part.

{"title": "NBA says Amazon will be its new media partner, rebuffing WBD attempt to match deal ", "selftext": "The National Basketball Association has told Warner Bros. Discovery it doesn‚Äôt intend to honor its matching rights and instead plans to move ahead with Amazon as a media partner.\n\n ‚ÄúWarner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs most recent proposal did not match the terms of Amazon Prime Video‚Äôs offer and, therefore, we have entered into a long-term arrangement with Amazon,‚Äù the NBA said in a statement Wednesday.\n\n ‚ÄúThroughout these negotiations, our primary objective has been to maximize the reach and accessibility of our games for our fans. Our new arrangement with Amazon supports this goal by complementing the broadcast, cable and streaming packages that are already part of our new Disney and NBCUniversal arrangements,‚Äù the league added. ‚ÄúAll three partners have also committed substantial resources to promote the league and enhance the fan experience. We are grateful to Turner Sports for its award-winning coverage of the NBA and look forward to another season of the NBA on TNT.‚Äù\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery said Monday it matched one of the NBA‚Äôs three media rights packages, which people familiar with the matter identified as the $1.93 billion per-year deal earmarked for Amazon Prime Video. Disney and Comcast‚Äôs NBCUniversal signed deals for the other two packages, part of the league‚Äôs $77 billion media rights renewal over 11 years.\n\n‚ÄúIn an effort to continue our long-standing partnership, during both exclusive and non-exclusive negotiation periods, we acted in‚ÄØgood faith to‚ÄØpresent‚ÄØstrong bids that were fair to both parties. Regrettably,‚ÄØthe league notified us of its intention to accept other offers for the games in our current rights package, leaving us to proceed under the‚ÄØmatching rights provision, which is an integral part of our current agreement and the rights we have paid for under it,‚Äù Warner Bros. Discovery said in a statement on Monday. ‚ÄØ‚ÄúThis will allow fans to keep enjoying our unparalleled coverage, including the best live game productions in the industry and our iconic studio shows and talent, while building on our proven 40-year commitment for many more years.‚Äù\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs Turner Sports has carried live NBA games for nearly 40 years. The cable network TNT is home to ‚ÄúInside the NBA,‚Äù the popular studio show starring Ernie Johnson, Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith and Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal. The future of the show is in doubt if the NBA doesn‚Äôt strike a deal with Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery acquired matching rights as part of its current media rights deal with the league, which expires at the end of next season. That provision allows the company to match payment for any of the games that air on TNT.\n\nThe NBA doesn‚Äôt believe Warner Bros. Discovery‚Äôs rights extend to an all-streaming package, as has been carved out for Amazon. Warner Bros. Discovery also owns a streaming service, Max, which it could use to air games.\n\nAmazon Prime Video has more than twice as many global customers ‚Äî more than 200 million to Max‚Äôs roughly 100 million ‚Äî which may make the service a more appealing platform for the league. The streaming rights are global, even though Warner Bros. Discovery is only bidding on U.S. rights, according to people familiar with the language in the contract.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/24/nba-picks-amazon-for-media-rights-over-warner-bros-discovery.html", "id": "1ebcqra", "created_utc": 1721855430.0, "score": 101, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "WBD earns $200M of Ebitda from NBA.\n\nAmazon's package has fewer games and costs $400M more per year than current Warner package.

Hear me out before you YOLO into your next meme stock. \n\n1. **E-Commerce Domination**: Amazon's e-commerce game is still on fire. They've got logistics down to a science, and their Prime membership is stickier than a Reddit rabbit hole at 3 AM. People ain't gonna stop buying stuff online, and Amazon is their go-to.\n\n2. **AWS Printing Money**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the real MVP here. It‚Äôs like the Bezos gold mine. AWS is raking in cash faster than I can burn it on tendies. Cloud computing is the future, and Amazon is sitting pretty at the top.\n\n3. **Diversification FTW**: While we're out here swinging for the fences with our trades, Amazon is playing the long game. They're diving into healthcare, groceries, streaming, and even space. Diversified AF. They're not putting all their eggs in one basket, unlike my last all-in bet on a biotech stock. \n\n4. **Prime Day and Beyond**: Remember Prime Day? It's like Black Friday had a baby with Christmas. Every year, they crush it with sales, and it just keeps getting bigger. More Prime Days, more money. Simple.\n\n5. **Leadership Shift**: New CEO Andy Jassy is in the house. This dude turned AWS into a cash cow, and now he's running the whole show. Bezos isn‚Äôt going anywhere; he‚Äôs just on to the next big thing (space, baby!).\n\n6. **Macro Trends**: Inflation is up, supply chains are jacked, but Amazon's got the muscle to weather the storm. They‚Äôve got the infrastructure and the cash reserves to come out stronger on the other side. Think long-term, not just next week‚Äôs paycheck.\n\n7. **Tech Innovation**: They‚Äôre always pushing the envelope. From AI to robotics, Amazon is investing in tech that keeps them ahead of the curve. Innovation = growth, and Amazon's got it in spades.\n\nSo there it is, fellow apes. Amazon is a juggernaut that's poised for some serious gains. Do your DD, but don't sleep on this one. Strap in and enjoy the ride to the moon üåï.\n\nTL;DR: Amazon is a money-printing machine with diversified streams and endless growth potential.
