I've opened calendars at $50, $55 (to sell before earning's), and $60. Ratio 3-1-3 so the ATM $55 cals just to pay off some of the risk, to sell *before* earning's. Extremely cheap cals with very high reward. This is what I look for. Win on one side totally offsets losses of other side. Expecting price $57-$59.\n\n**Google $179.39** \\- Expecting 10% move to the upside or flat, the market sold off heavily this week but Google was largely unaffected in-comparison. I've opened calendars at $170, $185, $200. Ratio 1-3-4 so the ATM $185 cals will sell half before earning's and others to hold through. If dumps downside protection $170 will cover some of the cost the other cals. This is my big play of the week.\n\n**Vertiv $85.28** \\- Expecting $80 to act like solid support, the next earning's will be their best quarter yet. It all comes down to forward guidance. I've opened $80 and $100 strike cals, may close everything before earning's as this company is too volatile to predict where jump will be or if trades flat. Jumps are 25% over the week which would put this around $110 pushing past its strong resistance of $105.\n\n**American Airlines $10.61** \\- Same story as Delta, should have good quarter compared to past quarters and report good earning's just like Delta and then sell off 3% barley moving up or down cause it's a boring not very volatile company.

Been acquiring shares for a while and have a few December calls as well, but that option chain is tough indeed.  It will pick up steam and the closer we get to expiration and the more exposure the fund gets, the more liquidity will pick up.  Definitely a long term play, though.  I like the mix of stocks to balance off the volatility of individual tickers when less than important news sends one up and the others down.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yes! Precisely my thoughts. Though I don’t appreciate the fee, the stability and diversity across the holdings is great. The fee is what prompted me to buy some calls 6-7 months out, initially. They were up quite a bit this past week and I wanted to stick to my rule of taking profit at certain points. Barely made it with what an MM would buy from me (I’m guessing.) I should have probably held - still learning, but that was part of the point of paying more for longer-dated (also December.) Scaling into shares bit by bit, though, for the same reasons. I may pick up some more calls as they are down a bit with everything and I think it’s one of the better risk/reward ratios in my portfolio.

Cheaper, less risk, wide breakevens, Theta positive, delta neutral at the start, it's a neutral structure profiting either direction depending where it's placed.

Make a lot crushing the short leg, keep the value of the long leg and sell at expiration after earning's play.

If Tesla breaks $300 am at double loss. I'd rather sell before earning's locking in 30%-80% profit on the spread if played Tesla. However, if that's case I needed to buy last Monday to give position time to burn Theta and not on the Friday before they report on Tuesday..
