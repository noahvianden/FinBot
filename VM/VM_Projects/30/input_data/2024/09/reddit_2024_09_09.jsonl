{"title": "AI and the Dotcom Bubble", "selftext": "I want to share some experience I had in the Dotcom era because I see it compared with AI and most of the comparisons are missing the point. \n\nI worked in the epicentre of the Dotcom bubble and although there are parallels with what is happening in AI, I don’t think people are applying the right lessons to Nvidia. There really isn’t an equivalent company in the Dotcom era to what Nvidia is now. People are saying Cisco but that’s not at all accurate. \n\nThe backbone of the Internet, all the most basic standards, were open source. No one owned the IP protocol. Success depended on having a good business plan and executing well. But the cost of getting on the Internet and scaling up was relatively cheap. \n\nAt the time the bubble burst, every major company was throwing money at internet business plans whether they made sense or not. The thing is, while most didn’t, some did - and those companies went on to become the biggest most successful in the world. Some, like Apple and Microsoft, predated the internet eta but adapted well. Some, like Amazon and Google, were born before the bubble burst, but rode it out and grew. Many others, eg Meta, took off after the bubble burst. \n\nSo where does Nvidia sit in that group? Well, there’s no equivalent, because AI isn’t founded on an open source protocol, it’s founded on insane amounts of computing power. Nvidia is the only company currently, and for the foreseeable future, able to supply that level of compute. And in the process it is creating an ecosystem of mega caps and startups who are using an Nvidia platform, CUDA. \n\nMany AI business plans will fail. OpenAI May fail. Who knows? It’s impossible to guess at this time which AI startups will become the next tech mega caps. The AI bubble hasn’t even started to inflate yet, because these startups aren’t public. But like the internet, I have no doubt that AI itself will become massively and increasingly valuable. And whichever AI plans work, at this point there is one certainty, which is that their AI models will be built on Nvidia’s platform.

{"title": "Why ElasticSearch (ESTC) is still overvalued after a 30% drop this month", "selftext": "I wanted to bring some qualitative discussion as to why I think Elasticsearch is only at the start of its downfall.\n\nYou'll need to know some history behind how Elasticsearch started and why it became so popular in the DevOps world. \n\nTLDR: They used to be opensource but Amazon basically stole their code and offered their service on AWS with the same name. Elasticsearch got pissed, changed their licensing from open source in 2021 and sued Amazon. Fast forward to today, theyve now settled with Amazon. However, since 2021, AWS has created their own competitor called Opensearch which is basically just a forked version of Elasticsearch with Amazons own contribution to it.... and they've been gaining a ton of market share.\n\nThe main reasons why\n\n1. Engineering managers and open source devs that spent time on developing Elasticsearch open source got screwed by Elastic in 2021 and trust eroded\n\n2. Opensearch is a part of the AWS ecosystem and why would a company go out of their way to add another vendor like Elastic if everythings already managed under AWS for them?\n\nThis graph shows a snapshot of the adoption of both:  \nhttps://db-engines.com/en/ranking\\_trend/system/Elasticsearch%3BOpenSearch%3BSplunk?\n\nAs you can see Opensearch is gaining more and more traction where as Elastic seems to be stagnating.\n\nHowever, anecdotally, I think this is worse than it looks for Elasticsearch. I know for a fact internally teams still refer to Opensearch as Elasticsearch because it is just a fork of it.\n\n  \nI think this story will be similar to how Microsoft Teams due to its distribution channels completely swept up market share from Zoom.

The amount of added work Elastic put on engineering teams to analyze pricing with the changing of licenses really confused the market and a lot of teams opted to switch to Opensearch even though their search as of now is not superior.

The only thing that has been really growing has been AI.” \n\nMore traditional tech areas such as software, IT consulting and the production of electronic equipment for other sectors such as manufacturing and the auto industry have faced difficulties, including weak demand and the hangover from overexpansion and overstocking of inventories during the coronavirus pandemic. Some have also directly suffered from the growth of AI, as customers with limited budgets redirect investment. \n\nDustin Moskovitz, the Facebook co-founder who is now chief executive of Asana, last week summed up the situation for many companies as the business software group scaled back its forecasts for the rest of the year. \n\n“What we’re seeing in tech is still kind of the unwinding of the over-hiring and overspending that we saw at the beginning of the pandemic,” he told analysts. “And then that all couples with what I think is massive uncertainty in the economic environment. And then, also, just with how AI is going to play out.” \n\nRecent financial reports show the majority of large tech companies have been growing more slowly than in the past, while many smaller ones are actively shrinking. \n\nGroups in the S&P 500 IT sub-index increased revenues by an average of 6.9 per cent over the past 12 months, according to Bloomberg data, compared with a five-year average of 10 per cent. About three-quarters of companies grew more slowly than their recent average. \n\nEarnings per share increased by an average of 16 per cent in the past 12 months, down from 21 per cent over the past five years. \n\nThe weakness is more obvious in small cap indices, where there is no boost from megacap groups. In the Russell 2000, technology was the second-worst performing sector in terms of revenue growth in the second quarter, according to data from LSEG. Revenue fell 6.1 per cent year on year, while profits were down 2.8 per cent. \n\n“Generative AI is masking a cyclical downturn in a lot of other core sectors,” said Ted Mortonson, a tech strategist at RW Baird. “Everyone is hoping things get better in the next few quarters, though hope is not an investment strategy.” \n\nEven within subsectors that have been caught up in the AI enthusiasm such as semiconductors, some business lines have been struggling. Brice Hill, chief financial officer at chip equipment supplier Applied Materials, told analysts last month that “we’re seeing particularly strong pull related to AI and data centre computing”, but there were “pockets of weakness in the auto and industrial end-markets”. \n\n“Everywhere you look on the industrial side it’s similar,” said John Barr, a portfolio manager at Needham Funds who has invested in several semiconductor companies including Applied Materials. “Current growth is not so great, so what we’re looking for are companies that have a stable business and are investing in something new.” Recommended Artificial intelligence Rethinking the AI boom, with Daron Acemoğlu \n\nInvestor exuberance around AI-focused companies has faded since the early summer, leading many commentators to predict a prolonged rotation of investor attention away from Big Tech stocks towards sectors such as financial services and industrials.  \n\nSome tech specialists are hoping for a similar intra-industry rotation from the biggest AI stocks to more unloved corners of the industry. While few companies are predicting the sort of triple-digit growth that Nvidia has reported in recent quarters, there are signs that some of the worst-performing parts of the tech sector are turning a corner. \n\n“I think we are seeing a stabilisation — things have stopped getting worse in those more macro-sensitive areas, and if rates go down then that will help,” said Tony Wang, portfolio manager for T Rowe Price’s science and technology fund. \n\n“I feel like the idea that AI is the only thing that is working has been the case for the last two years. I’m not sure it will be the case for the next two.”", "id": "1fcvhdq", "created_utc": 1725903821.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 39, "comments": [{"body": "The quotes that most caught my attention were:\n\n1) \"“Generative AI is masking a cyclical downturn in a lot of other core sectors,”\n\n2) \"Investor exuberance around AI-focused companies has faded since the early summer, leading many commentators to predict a prolonged rotation of investor attention away from Big Tech stocks towards sectors such as financial services and industrials.\"  \n  \nRegarding the second point, I personally have not seen any signs of a rotation into industrials --specifically, materials.
