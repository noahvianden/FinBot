When all is done, the process will take at least a year, possibly even three.\n\nAll of this said, the upcoming expansionary cycle - should the fed pull it off - has the potential to be quite explosive for the consumer electronics and thus semis. However, the semi fab business is very conservative in order to avoid overproduction, so the upside may be more limited than people may think.
