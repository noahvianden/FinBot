A newb question here. In your chart when you ROLL an option, the reason for that is because the option's pnl became negative?

I understand the ROLL process involves buying back your option and selling another one further away, is this correct?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Hey CheeseDon. Thanks for the comments. Newb questions are welcome. We are all here because we  enjoy investing or are trying to learn. \n\nFor options, I am not very concerned with the P/L of the position itself. It is actually a bit misleading. For example, if you set a covered call for $10 and the share price goes past $10, the p/l continues to become more and more negative. That negative does not represent how much you owe or lost. It represents the fact that if you did not sell a covered call in the first place, you would have made more. To add to this, you may be in the company at $5 and would not mind taking assignment because you have doubled your money, so you intentionally did not roll. You are waiting for your $10 assignment and it is showing negative, even though your plan worked as expected.\n\nIn the case of my choice to roll, there are many reasons. In general, I am keeping my strike ahead of the share price. During a roll, you are closing out a position and simultaneously opening a new one. The roll is an adjustment on the original position. You use DTEs, strike price, and premium as levers to adjust the original play. I say this because you can't have it all. For example: You can increase DTEs and get a higher strike and premium or you can lower your premium to get a higher strike. In other words, you have to sacrifice one of the three to adjust your position.\n\nWhen I roll, I almost always roll for a net credit. This means that the amount to close the original position will be less than the premium gained on the new position. That is why you see positive numbers in my chart. \n\nHopefully this makes sense.

For now it is 2026, and I believe they will go out to 2027 either tomorrow or sometime in the next week. When I do purchase a LEAPS, the strike is usually right below the current value. This is because I am entering a LEAPS on a company that I believe will do well long term.

Instead, I am relying on the increase in share price to drive the profit. \n\nOn the other hand, if the LEAPS does not work out, I am only out the premium paid upfront.

I bought them many months before this run up.\n\nWhen HOOD reached the early 20 dollars, I sold a cash secured put with a strike of 18 dollars that expires on Sept 20th with a cost basis of 17 dollars. My logic with this that it had to fall 10% to be ITM which was just within the range of expected move, and on top of that I believe in this stock so I would have allowed it to be put to me at 18 dollars as I feel that would have been an easy money maker in the long run. However, it is looking as though it will expire worthless - just as fine with me!\n\nWhen HOOD reached 21 dollars as it was still continuing to climb, I sold a Covered Call with a strike of 24 dollars that expires on Sept 27th.\n\nThese are where my questions come in:\n\nAt the time of my selling of the call, the strike of 24 dollars was over 12% away from the stock price which was higher than the expected move if I did the math correctly, so I felt as though it was safer. I didn't think the premium price for a closer expiry was worth doing. I also wanted to make sure I was doing a strike price that was higher than my cost basis for the actual shares of the stock.\n\nIt looks as though its possible these will be ITM. Do you allow your stocks to be called away? Or do you always roll your position to a later date and higher strike? At what percent of the underlying price in relation to your strike option price do you start to roll? For example: If my strike is 24 and the week before it reaches 23.15 - Do you roll it because it's within a certain percentage away? Was there a better call I could have sold?

I** rarely allow this to happen. I will always try to roll out of a situation where my shares can possibly taken away. Why? Because I want to own the shares long term and will roll for a minimal premium, higher strike, and higher DTES, rather than lose that long term money maker. \n\n**At what percent of the underlying price in relation to my strike option do I start to roll?** I am not so concerned with a specific percentage, I am starting to watch closely as the underlying approaches my strike. Because I am selling covered calls on share prices in the range of $5 to $260, it is not a certain dollar amount, so I'll just say when it gets \"close\". If CRWD ($258 per share) is within $5, this is getting close. If RIOT ($7 per share) is within $1 it may or may not be considered close. This is where I would say that you have a slight advantage keeping up with earnings reports, and major economic data releases such as labor/jobs information or Fed meetings. Especically with the upcoming rate cut. Will it be .25 or .50? Either way, the market will interpret it in different ways and we will just have to wait for the consensus whether it is positive or negative.

Meaning, I keep the shares and the premium made on the roll.\n\n**PLTR goes down**. If it goes down enough, I can roll backward and reduce some DTEs with a possible credit. This is in addition to keeping the shares and the premium from this particular roll.\n\nLastly, I will say that this supports my large inventory. Some may argue that I own too many shares.

On the technicals, I am between .1-.2 Delta (fairly conservative). Other technical indicators that I look at are support and resistance levels, moving averages, and recent price trends to gauge price movement.
