{"title": "💰Going Long on TSM: The Unseen Goldmine Behind NVDA’s Success💰", "selftext": "Fellow apes, I want to discuss a compelling investment thesis for TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company). This isn't about hype; it's about understanding the strategic position TSM holds in the semiconductor industry.\n\nKey to this thesis is the relationship between TSM and one of its largest clients, NVDA. NVDA, a leader in the GPU market, relies almost exclusively on TSM for its chip manufacturing needs. This reliance is crucial because NVDA's business model boasts impressive gross margins, around 90%.\n\nThe crux of the investment argument for TSM lies in this dependency. TSM, as a leading foundry, has not yet fully leveraged its pricing power. Given the increasing demand for advanced chips and the limited number of players capable of manufacturing them at the cutting-edge level that companies like NVDA require, TSM is in a prime position to renegotiate pricing.\n\nAs TSM realizes its strategic advantage and adjusts its pricing model to reflect the value it provides, we can anticipate a significant impact on its revenues and margins. This scenario is not far-fetched considering the growing demand for semiconductors and the substantial investments TSM is making in advanced manufacturing technologies.\n\nIn conclusion, going long on TSM is a bet on the company's ability to capitalize on its pivotal role in the semiconductor supply chain. It's a play on the increasing value of chip manufacturing in a tech-driven world and TSM's unique position within that realm.\n\nYes, there is geopolitical risk but a war would also mean no chips for iPhones, NVDA and pretty much all advanced electronics. They have a plant planned in America but from whatever I can research, this is running a decade late.\n", "id": "19cpyw1", "created_utc": 1705907577.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.55, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|39|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unjcq3/dd_short_edr_based_on_disney_results/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv0h06/looks_like_net_is_behind_aapl_new_icloud_relay/) \n**Account Age**|12 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Unseen?

While TSMC holds a lot of prestige in the semiconductor industry as an inovator, today (like every chip foundry under the sun) it relies on ASML tech for lithography.\n2. ASML can only churn out so many of their printers per year.\n3. Even with ungodly demand for Nvidia chips manufactured by TSMC they can only increase capacity by so much to keep up with demand. \n4. By the time TSMC increases, or is able to increase, production the rest of the world which right now is trying to localize their production of semiconductors, will likely have started their own chip foundries. \n\nDue to the above, I think TSMC is well priced in, I mean they can come out with some revolutionary process to produce chips faster, but due to the current technological limitations I think that is a bit unlikely, still I would argue that TSMC, ASML and NVDIA are worthy buys if you're looking for a buy and hold strategy.", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "They’re making chips in Taiwan?
