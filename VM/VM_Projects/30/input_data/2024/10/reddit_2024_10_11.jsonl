If you buy an option, you have the right but not the obligation to do anything at expiration. When selling, you give up the right and are obligated to complete the transaction at or before expiration. \n\nLet’s say a stocks price is $50 and you sell a $45 put. Before expiration the stock craters to $10 per share. You are obligated to buy 100 shares of the stock at $45 for $4,500 and then you’re immediately down $35 per share as your position is only worth $1,000. So the immediate paper losses could be substantial. \n\nSelling calls are either covered or uncovered (or naked). Never ever never sell a naked call. Being uncovered or naked means that you don’t own 100 shares per contract that you’re selling and you are theoretically on the hook for unlimited losses if the stock rises to $infinity. A covered call is far less risky as you own the underlying shares, which can be sold to “cover” your losses if the call is ITM. So if you own 100 shares of that stock at $50 and sell 1 $55 call, you collect the premium upfront. If the stock is trading anywhere below $55 + Premium, then it won’t be exercised and you keep your shares. If it’s trading at $60 at/before expiration, your 100 shares will be assigned (or called away) to the buyer of the option you sold. Your proceeds would be 100 shares X $55 strike price + Premium received, HOWEVER, you will no longer own the shares and you would’ve missed out on that extra $5 share price growth to $60. \n\nI know this is a lot but hope it helps!

The part of this that gets to people is that they may well buy NVDA today and still beat the index, but there is is also a huge amount of exposure to the bell curve (lower returns) that is well to the downside that you buy along with the stock. \n\nLet's take a relatively hated stock - like the Brazilian Iron miner Vale SA. They had dam failures that killed a lot of people, China is their biggest customer and their economy is slowing, and management has a tenuous relationship with their local government and their local government is heavily left-leaning and has a reputation for wanting to be increasingly involved in the company's decision making processes. They also are a capital intensive industry so they have a lot of debt, and as the equity has fallen in price their capitalization structure looks increasingly precarious. They also have currency risk as left-leaning governments of Brazil's type often engage in inflationary policies which could devalue their exports in the international market. But by the price the market is telling us it expects low returns from this company in the relatively near term. Yet, if we are sitting on a bell curve, our exposure to the left side of the curve is limited. We may still under perform the average, but we have a \\*lot\\* of exposure to the right side of the bell curve. \n\nThe trick as an individual investor is to gain certainty regarding 1.) Where you are on the probability curve \\*right now\\* and 2.) If you slice up the curve, figure how likely are you to land somewhere to the right or left. Most people are biased towards finding themselves to the right side of the curve 3.) by some mechanism (research and modelling typically) try to decrease the amount of uncertainty about the future regarding the security, which allows you more certainty regarding the security's likely position on the curve.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "The thing is everything tesla showed is already being done but better by other companies. \n\nIt will be a long time before they work the way elon envisions.\n\nWaymo/Google already does robotaxis\n\nHyundai bought Boston dynamics for basically 1b.

Their software isn't that bad and they seem to have good integrations already.) and finally the last point being how comfortable it is and the aesthetics. These are subjective topics but I think the car Tesla showed was more streamlined and had less clutter overall.\n\nFor the robot, we simply don't know how much things are going on in the background. Maybe they are close to things they promote or they are so far off and only at the start, who knows. But the demo looked somewhat promising and even if they are far away from competitors in this category, they are doing pretty well in other categories and I think Tesla has a good shot at the robotics with the resource and knowledge it has.
