{"title": "Some thoughts on TSMC and NVDA price movements", "selftext": "Note: NVDA popped overnight because of TSMC's spectacular ER.  And because I have no life beyond work and f'ing around in Anaconda at home, here's some gee whiz info on the relationship between TSMC and NVDA.  \n  \nAs should surprise no one, TSMC and NVDA are moderately correlated in price movement.  TSMC produces a majority of NVDA's product lines, and NVDA accounts for a large portion of TSMC's core business.  The Pearson Correlation Coefficient between NVDA and TSMC is .67, which implies a medium to strong movement int he same direction daily.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8bxf3ku19bvd1.png?width=1337&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b1d44dcb792409408167279c26faabce047a27f\n\nTaking this one step further, we can use a linear regression with TSMC as the predictor variable to predict NVDA.  Technically we can flip that, but that might be meaningless as on a given day, TSMC closes before NVDA opens for the day.\n\nThe regression equation is  NVDA\\_Return = 0.0017 + 0.9824 \\* TSMC\\_Return and the R-sq is .45, which is about what I would expect with a PCC of .67.  \n\nI ran a back test of the equation on the 5th trading day of each month and the results were about what I expected.  If anything, NVDA tends to be a bit more extreme than predicted.  There is only a couple of test days where the sign of the movement was flipped (TSMC pos / NVDA neg or vice versa).  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cmbhooanbbvd1.png?width=1115&format=png&auto=webp&s=812ab86a0751c2e241e0c3796135977876c8eb5a\n\n", "id": "1g5q3zi", "created_utc": 1729169440.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "You forgot to add “do what you will with this info” to your post.

Outside of one token attack against Israel (to play on state propaganda tv ) after the killing of Hezbollah's leader there has been minimal escalation from Iran. \n\nHamas' leadership structure is now vaporized. The upper echelons are now either dead or living in Qatar. ISW assesses that Hamas Command and Control structures inside Gaza are broken and Hamas' remaining fighters are operating in isolated and scattered groups. Daily attacks have dropped significantly over the past 6 weeks. \n\nIran has few levers left to pull. They can try escalating with more missile strikes against Israel, however, the world is still waiting on an Israeli response to the last wave of strikes. and I highly doubt the Ayatollah's want to poke the bear even further. \n\nFurthermore, most of this risk would already be priced in. The bigger risk for global oil prices - which the world has been waiting on for about a week - is going to be the Israeli response to Iran's most recent missile launch. Whatever Iran does in response to Sinwar's death will be irrelevant compared to the Israeli response that may or may not be coming.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Why would you furthermore write a response with chatgpt.
