Yandex‚Äôs core market was very much its domestic Russia plus a handful of neighboring countries, however its parent was a Dutch holding organization called Yandex N.V. which went public on the Nasdaq in 2011, followed by a secondary listing three years later on the Moscow Exchange.\n\nYandex N.V. was doing well as a public company, reaching a valuation of $31 billion at the end of 2021 before the Russia-Ukraine conflict kickstarted a series of global sanctions against companies in the region, and also individuals. Yandex co-founder and CEO Arkady Volozh was forced to resign after the European Union placed him on a sanctions list, although he was removed from the list in March 2024 which paved the way for his return as CEO of the next version of Yandex N.V.\n\nThat next version is Nebius and its business is based on one of Yandex N.V.‚Äôs few remaining assets outside of Russia: a Finnish data center and AI cloud business called Nebius AI. The new entity formally emerged back in July, outlining its plans to be a ‚ÄúEuropean AI compute leader,‚Äù similar to something like CoreWeave ‚Äî a company that is also in the midst of expanding into Europe, raising a ton of equity and debt en-route.\n\nWhile the Nasdaq had said in 2022 that it would delist Yandex and several other Russian-affiliated companies, Yandex appealed and the Nasdaq agreed to maintain its listing ‚Äî but keep a halt on trading as it went about severing its Russian ties. With those ties terminated earlier this year, and $2 billion in the bank from selling its Russian assets, Volozh said at the time that he intended to continue Nebius as a public company, as it was an easier and cheaper way to access capital, in what is a very capital intensive business.\n\n‚ÄúOur ambition is to build one of the world‚Äôs largest specialist AI infrastructure businesses,‚Äù Volozh said in a statement. ‚ÄúThis requires access to technological expertise, graphics processing units and capital.
