{"title": "NVDA Chart 08-13-24: Bullish RSI and MacD", "selftext": "NVDA is about to cross the 50 day moving average on the 1D chart at 116.14. Next major resistance is 118.71 and after that is 134. There is support at the 20 day moving average at 111.50 if it falls below you are looking at 110 then 108 then 101. However it is looking bullish on the RSI and MACD. With a RSI at 52 there is plenty of room to run. If by earnings NVDA makes a move to test resistance at 134 it will test the ATH at 140.\n\nNow if NVDA goes parabolic for earnings and the RSI gets above 80,  if you are in options that is a good time to trim or take profits depending on the expiration. An RSI can be pegged above 80 and still go up but at that point it is only a matter of time before the overbought condition sells off. Usually that sell off will gravitate to a pivot point or moving average.\n\nEdit: If NVDA retests the highs the RSI will most likely be at or close to 80. How do you know when NVDA will dip back down if the RSI is pegged at 80. One way is to look for a confluence with the MACD. In the MACD on this chart the one at the bottom there is a blue line and a red line. Simple explanation is those correspond with moving averages. (You can read about it more online.) In a nut shell if the blue line bounces off the red line it is still bullish. If it crosses below the red line it is bearish.\n\nHowever the RSI could dip below 80 and \"burn off some of the RSI\" for another move up. How do you gauge this? By seeing if it holds support at the closest moving averages, 9, 15 and 20 will be the closest on this chart. If it breaks the 20 then it tends to gravitate to the 50 day. I typically trim a little when it hits 80 but wait it out to see if the MACD turns bearish and if it holds support at the 20 day. The stock could chop around at the 20 day for a few trading sessions burning off the RSI. Always keep in mind you can't time the top or bottom. And keep in mind that the market mechanics are set by algorithms that are set to buy and sell at moving averages, RSI, MACD and other indicators as well as news. So use this as a gauge to figure how much elevation you have climbed to the summit in the short term. If you have a long view and are in shares....check back after earnigns on 8/28 and around Thanksgiving.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cm58drs5snid1.jpg?width=1447&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e882cfad9529839328b311e319d2c377ad9ea8c2\n\n", "id": "1eroi2n", "created_utc": 1723597555.0, "score": 72, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "This is honestly the first post that was intelligent on this site", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good info; thank you! üëç", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "You're welcome.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Good stuff.

First off 10 times the trading volume of AAPL is 655 million shares‚Ä¶currently NVDA is averaging 355 million‚Ä¶not correct. \n\n AAPL and MSFT are not ‚Äúchump companies‚Äù, they are the two biggest companies in the SP500. AAPL‚Äôs market cap is 3.36 trillion, MSFT is 3.09 trillion and NVDA is 2.83 trillion. AAPL has a 2 billion install base (users) world wide with 75% of those users phones about to go obsolete by the end of 2025 with the roll out of the new AI chips in the iPhone. That doesn‚Äôt even take into account the iPad, laptop, desktop, and wearables upgrades coming. Another ‚Äúchump company‚Äù you mentioned is MSFT? You realize they are partnered with the biggest player in AI which is Open AI. Open AI runs their platform on MSFT‚Äôs Azure servers and MSFT has begun to roll out AI on Co-pilot. In fact the way this will go is eventually the successful companies that make profit from AI will reap the most profit in the long run by selling to consumers. Guess who will most likely be in the front ‚Ä¶AAPL, MSFT, META, and GOOGL.  \n\nChip manufactures will start to become cyclical once the build out reaches a certain capacity. That includes NVDA. Then training will reach a operational level and slow as the compute is handled on the edge. The Hyper-scalers at some point will turn their CAPEX away from building servers and direct it to products. NVDA will most likely have a good run into 2026 but it will take 1 quarter of them showing okay numbers for the stock to sell off. NVDA will still grow but it will take something like robotics to sustain this type of market cap‚Ä¶TBD.\n\nNot ‚Äúevery‚Äù company and gamer uses NVDA chips. For example Google uses NVDA but also uses Tensor Processing Units (TPU) for AI and machine learning. AAPL does not have a NVDA server. AAPL is using Googles TPU‚Äôs to train APPL intelligence. MSFT also uses NVDA but also use the Azure chips.\n\nTSMC is building plants in Arizona but NVDA is not their only customer. In fact AAPL is one of their biggest customers. AAPL accounts for roughly 25% of TSMC‚Äôs revenue, NVDA 11% and AMD 7%. The build out is partly because of pressure of a China invasion in Taiwan and the US government  giving them billions to build in the US through the Chip Act. \n\nYes Elon is buying NVDA chips but at some point the build out will reach completion and it will be smaller and smaller orders as CAPEX starts to affect margin pressures. That goes for all the hyper-scalers. \n\nNow if you read this users comment on how to go ‚Äúeducated yourself‚Äù by reading online, you will find he needs to educate himself.

According to BCG forecasts, by 2032, the U.S. is expected to produce about 14% of the world's wafers, up from the current 10%. Without the Act's support, this figure would drop to 8% by 2032.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ql00qa4mblid1.jpg?width=782&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fcfc2ebb6208c46f219d109747a3faec604084a8\n\nThe immediate priority is to establish at least two major clusters for advanced logic chip manufacturing (the brains of devices). Officials also aim to build large-scale advanced packaging facilities, which are crucial for connecting chips to other hardware. Additionally, they seek to boost the production of traditional chips, as the U.S. is concerned about China's growing capacity in this area. Advanced DRAM memory, essential for AI development, is also a focus.\n\n\n\n4.¬† Intel is a major beneficiary of the CHIPS Act, receiving $8.5 billion in direct assistance and $11 billion in support loans from the U.S. Department of Commerce to support its over $100 billion chip investment plan. Intel also stands alone as the sole recipient of a $3.5 billion plan to produce advanced electronics for the military, despite controversy in Washington.\n\n5.¬† Other chip manufacturers face challenges. TSMC, Intel, and Samsung have committed to investing $400 billion in U.S. factories, but most have missed their targets due to various issues. For instance, TSMC has been reluctant to move its production lines and packaging capabilities from Taiwan, as chip packaging is seen as Taiwan's \"trump card\" in ensuring U.S. protection.\n\n6.¬† The broader challenge remains workforce shortages. McKinsey estimates that the U.S. semiconductor industry will face a shortage of 59,000 to 77,000 engineers in the next five years. Without immigration reform and a cultural shift toward hardware innovation, the U.S. may struggle to maintain its lead even if it builds new factories.\n\nFor individuals, pursuing a two-year technical degree at a community college could be a smart career move, as over 80 semiconductor-related courses have been introduced or expanded since the CHIPS Act was passed.", "id": "1erwcsu", "created_utc": 1723624202.0, "score": 108, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "Grandma proud", "score": 72, "replies": [{"body": "TLDR, came for the grandma jokes.", "score": 16, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Intel is terrible on so many levels and trying to puff the tires isn‚Äôt going to change a thing and here is why: \n\n- Intel just cut jobs (1/5 of the workforce) \n\n- Intel has halted or slowed construction on all the fabs they have over here. \n\n- Intel has missed their construction targets multiple times and has moved them multiple times right \n\n- If something happens to Taiwan there will be a war and everyone is fucked. Intel isn‚Äôt some golden goose that will shine in the darkness \n\n- Both Samsung and TSMC have both gotten tons of money in loans and grants for Fabs. Both of which do better than Intel. They are also building in other places around the world too while Intel has halted things. \n\n- Intel has halted other chip plants around the world. Most that are continuing building are ones where an investment group is buying like a 50% stake in said fabs. Which isn‚Äôt good for long term profitability. \n\n- Intel‚Äôs 13th gen and 14th gen chips just got an alleged fix to their microcode. **Before this fix chips overtime were degrading and essentially bricking themselves**. People and business **are not happy**. **A lot of trust is gone because they handled this all the wrong way and some business lost millions**. \n\n- Going off of my last point they still need to sell the 13th and 14th gen cpu‚Äôs in their inventory. The trust is gone. No one unless Intel sells them for dirt cheap is going to buy them. This is going to have a lot of future consequences. CCG over the next two quarters might not look so good. \n\n- Intel is currently getting their lunch money taken by AMD in Datacenter/AI chips. This isn‚Äôt going to change and could get much much worse. Intel currently has margins of 9% here. They are basically giving them away. \n\n- A lot of companies are moving to Amd in Datacenter/Ai . Intel might have agreements and contracts but many of those will expire in the future. \n\n- Intel has debt that‚Äôs growing and continues to grow. They have 20 billion of cash on hand and almost 52 billion in debt while the market cap is hovering in the 80-90 billion range. If this falls at all we will see banks calling. \n\n- Intels investments like Mobileye for example have fallen quite a lot. It could have been used for an emergency piggy bank for them. At one point their stake was worth 25 billion now it‚Äôs worth 10 ish billion. \n\n- Intel when announcing the job cuts also said they were cutting time off, vacation time people earned and benefits and quality of life things across the board to save money. Their stock is also bricking and shows no momentum. \n\n- Why is the above point important ? **Because Intel already has a talent problem that NOW has exponentially got worse.** What is left of the talent is going to leave, or is getting to get cut in layoffs and new employees are going to be bottom of the barrel. \n\n- Cutting 1/5 of the workforce isn‚Äôt a small thing. Do people really think this won‚Äôt affect their releases as well as engineering on chips going forward ? \n\n- If Intel loses any support at all in CCG they will be in monster trouble. It‚Äôs the only big area of support they still have. The 13th and 14th gen scandal and their lack of leadership handling it is going to be trouble. \n\n- They are probably going to be taken off the Dow shortly in place of Nvidia or AMD. Which will then cause funds to sell their positions. \n\nI don‚Äôt understand why anyone would buy Intel right now when their fabs they keep talking about keep getting delayed and probably won‚Äôt be working until late 2026 to mid 2027.

There‚Äôs so many domino effects here. \n\n- Intel handled this in all the wrong ways. They called out motherboard manufacturers then realized it was their problem and flip flopped on warranties. And sort of tried to minimize the problem at the start of things. \n\n- A lot of people who bought prebuilts or built their own PC are going to go to Amd next time if they weren‚Äôt already\n\n- People who haven‚Äôt bought a new cpu yet are gonna stay far away from 13th and 14th gen chips regardless if the code/issues are fixed. \n\n- Business‚Äôs got really burnt by this too. I can‚Äôt imagine companies are happy at all. This will only accelerate people moving away from Intel to AMD or even Arm. \n\n- Now the benefit is in mid October Intel likely releases new chips but I just can‚Äôt imagine it selling as well now that the trust is gone. They are still going to need to sell through their stock of 13th and 14th gen chips and I don‚Äôt know how they are going to do that.
