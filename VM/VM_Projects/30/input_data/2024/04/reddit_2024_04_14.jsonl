You're right that a straddle is a neutral strategy, but it's a bad idea to just buy a straddle because you're unsure of a stock's direction. Buying a straddle, in this case, is betting that the move from earnings will be larger than the options are pricing in.

As tensions simmer, and with OPEC+ keeping a tight lid on production, this latest episode might strain global stockpiles even further.\n\nAccording to Rosalind Mathieson, a Bloomberg News Director:\n\n>As with other market assets, **the outlook for oil seems to hinge on any Israeli response to the Iranian attack.** Trading resumes at 6pm New York time on Sunday. The risk of a direct Iranian attack on Israel was already at least partly priced in — benchmark Brent crude, up 17% this year, passed $90 a barrel after the strike on Iran’s diplomatic compound in Syria.\n\nHere's what the smart cats at Bloomberg estimated could happen.  \nI should point out that at this point in time, we might be moving into the purple band.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[from Bloomberg Economics](https://preview.redd.it/nvvreyf3diuc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29db1a212dc1e8db614a250d492429cc765f5252)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Wednesday, we'll get the weekly crude oil inventories (prior +5.84 mln) at 10:30 ET.  \nIt won't move the markets, but people will pay more attention.\n\nAs for the closing numbers from Friday:\n\nCL00-USA Crude Oil futures: $0.58 higher (+0.7%) at $85.58/barrel.  \nNG00-USA Nat Gas: (0.0%) at $1.77/MMBtu.  \nRB00-USA RBOB Gasoline: $0.02 higher (+0.7%) at $2.80/gallon.  \nHO00-USA Heating oil futures: $0.03 higher (+1.1%) at $2.69/gallon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI won't delve into what each country should or should not do.  \nI can only control what I do.\n\nIf Israel's response adds a log to the fire, I'm building my watchlist for those sectors that are bound to get panicky sellers—those who rely on oil prices.\n\nSo far, I'm planning to short **IBIT**, but I will wait to see either a weak open or confirmation regarding Israel's response. Assuming she gaps down, I'll wait to avoid an expected initial bounce.\n\nThat's the iShares Bitcoin Trust.  \nMy thesis is that those investors who trust Bitcoin will invest directly in Bitcoin.  \nThose who are dwindling their feet in that water through an ETF are bound to get jittery.  \nAnd also, it might get more expensive for Bitcoin miners to operate, I assume.\n\nI will wait to see if **LUV** convincingly breaks her support at around $27.  \nIf she does and other airlines follow along, I might even go with **FLYD**, instead. That's the MicroSectors Travel 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN.\n\nAnd I will keep my eyes on **OILD** (MicroSectors Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN) and **OILU** (MicroSectors Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 3x ETN).  \nUnless the direct conflict turns into war (instead of calculated act-and-wait), I will just play shares and not options since I'm not willing to pay for volatility or not reacting as fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a short-term swing trader, I'll mostly avoid any overnight positions.  \nThere are bound to be some big trend-follower players that might offload, so I'll keep an eye out on which sector they run out first.
