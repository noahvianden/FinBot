{"title": "Investor's Guide to Gold in 2024", "selftext": "Here is a brief article I wrote about gold ( No link, as my intention is not to promote the site). Mainly just looking to start a discussion about the current state of the market. I still think it has some more room upward, but I wouldn't be surprised by a retracement first obv. Feel free to add any critiscms or feedback as well!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2024, gold has continued to steal the spotlight on the financial stage, peaking impressively at $2,430 per ounce on Friday, before retracting and hovering around the $2,350 level. This significant ascent, representing a 14% growth since the beginning of the year, challenges traditional market expectations amidst evolving economic policies and ongoing global tensions.\r  \n\r  \n**What's Fueling the Rally?**\r  \n\r  \nMonetary Policy\r  \n\r  \nThe influence of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, especially its control over interest rates, is a strong factor in the pricing of gold. Typically, lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding gold, which does not yield interest. This makes gold more appealing compared to interest-bearing assets, as the previous interest income becomes less significant. In 2024, even as expectations for June rate cuts have faded, gold prices have paradoxically continued to rise. This trend can be linked to a broader search among investors for safe, reliable investments in case of a future situation where inflation continues to diminish the real returns of traditional fixed-income assets.\r  \n\r  \nGeopolitical Factors\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nGold’s role as a safe-haven asset is magnified during periods of geopolitical instability. In 2024, conflicts and political uncertainties have escalated in regions like the Middle East and Eastern Europe, prompting investors to turn to gold for security. The metal’s price increase is closely aligned with these developments, serving as a testament to its status as a refuge amid uncertainty. As tensions continue, the demand for gold is likely to remain robust, further driving its price upward.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nInflation Hedge\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nGold is widely recognized as an effective hedge against inflation, preserving purchasing power when currency values erode. As economic indicators continue to point to sustained inflation, particularly in major economies, investors increasingly rely on gold to protect their wealth. This year’s persistent high inflation rates have reinforced gold's appeal, pushing more investors to add the precious metal to their portfolios as a defensive strategy against diminishing currency value.\r  \n\r  \nDiversification by Central Banks\r  \n\r  \nCentral banks play a significant role in the gold market, particularly through their efforts to diversify reserves away from traditional fiat currencies like the US dollar. Notably, countries like China have been increasing their gold reserves, viewing the metal as a more stable alternative amidst global financial volatility. This strategic diversification has contributed to the upward pressure on gold prices, as it not only shows the demand from central banks but also boosts investor confidence in gold’s long-term value.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n**Ways To Benefit From The Rise**\r  \n\r  \nBuying Physical Gold\r  \n\r  \nPurchasing physical gold in forms such as coins, bars, or jewelry is obviously the most direct and secure method to gain exposure to the rising price of gold. However, this option requires secure storage and insurance, which increases costs. Additionally, physical gold has lower liquidity, making it time-consuming to sell and potentially involves higher transaction fees.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nBroader Precious Metals Market\r  \n\r  \nExploring other precious metals like silver, platinum, and palladium can provide diversified investment opportunities while still capitalizing on the sector's momentum. These metals often follow similar market trends as gold but can offer additional benefits due to their industrial applications. Diversifying investments across various precious metals can help mitigate risks associated with any single market.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nGold-Linked Financial Instruments\r  \n\r  \nFor investors seeking exposure to gold prices without the complexities of handling physical gold, gold-linked financial instruments such as ETFs and mutual funds are ideal. Gold ETFs allow investors to trade shares tied directly to the market price of gold, offering high liquidity and lower transaction costs than physical gold.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nJunior Mining Companies ( $DC,$JAGGF,$WISE.CN)\r  \n\r  \nInvesting in junior mining companies offers a high-risk but potentially high-reward strategy, as their stock prices may leverage gold price movements. These companies, often in the exploration or early development stages, can benefit significantly from rising gold prices. However, their success also hinges on their operational efficiency and the ability to navigate regulatory environments, making them a volatile investment choice.\r  \n", "id": "1c34jph", "created_utc": 1713022058.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 47, "comments": [{"body": "I like and own gold, but I wouldn’t consider it an investment.

On the flip-side with CSPs, I have a few out to 2026 because they kept decreasing. \n\nUsually on the rolls, I am looking to roll when the strike is tested within about $1.00. When it gets to within 50 cents, I am actively rolling. With few exceptions, I am looking to get a modest credit. I rarely roll when I have to pay a debit. \n\nRight now, all the calls that I had pushed out several months and some that were rolled out to 2026 are doing pretty well. Of course, this means that the underlying is not doing well, but it also means that I may be in a position to close out the long term roll or roll it backwards. Similar with the PUTs, as those tickers begin to rise, I can close out or roll back the 2026 positions I have. \n\nSince the options I sell are simply supplementing my overall buy and hold strategy, I am ok with waiting out positions that I have rolled into the future and just ride out the Theta.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for clarification .

Do you typically let your options expire, or do you buy them back at a certain point?\n\n2) If I don’t have enough funds to own 100 shares of a stock of which I want to sell options, are there any strategies in particular you recommend? I’ve tried iron condors a few times but always got ‘unlucky’ with them..\n\nThanks for your guidance!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Hey there ChestnutDelta2107,\n\nThanks for the questions. I can't say that I never buy back as I actually bought back AMZN today; however, I don't have a plan to buy back on a regular basis. The decision to buy back the AMZN covered call was based on my ability to make more in weekly covered calls than the amount of the buy back. For example, my buy back was $17 with an expiration of next Friday. I may be able to sell in the morning for at least $10 and I think I will make between $10 and $20 next week. This is more than my $17 buy back. It also reduces my risk of having to roll out and up if AMZN begins rising significantly between now and next Thursday. Bottom line is that I think I will make more than $17 by next Friday. We shall see.\n\nIf you want to sell options but don't have the funds for that particular stock, I would look at LEAPS. This will allow you to lock in a price for the underlying for a premium that is usually about a third to half as expensive as buying all 100 shares. Since I used AMZN above, Ill use it again. If I am buying a LEAPS, I am looking as far out as possible. In the case of AMZN, the furthest out right now is December 18, 2026. If you were looking at a $170 strike with that expiration, the price would be about $5,400. This will give you the rights to buy AMZN at $170, whenever you want up until that expiration. It can also be used as collateral to sell covered calls against. Now $5,400 is much less than buying 100 AMZN shares as they currently go for $176 which would be $17,600. So, it is even less than a 3rd to purchase a LEAPS.\n\nLet me know if you need clarification on anything above. If not, best of luck to you.

Thanks again and best of luck to you.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm new to the thread, but I took notice of your rolling strategy...Monitoring daily and taking advantage of opportunities to roll in various directions is a very interesting concept...I usually exit and re-enter a trade for similar reasons, but rolling out is nothing more than selling a calendar. So with a CSP, in theory if you sold the calendar (rolled out) when vol was high and bought it back when vol normalized that would lower your cost basis and (possibly) allow you to roll backwards. Since a calendar is just a special case of a diagonal which allows you to roll along both the price and time axes; if you were able to optimize these terms then I could definitely see building a strategy around it...\n\nI actually used to run a sub on option trading...So, I have a few suggestions that may help your strategy.\n\n1. Someone mentioned that robinhood doesn't pay interest on your cash. Short duration treasury etfs like BIL can be used to approximate daily interest due to the way they are arbitraged. I personally just use a bond ladder with 3m t-bills but, I do use BIL for some things. Just remember that etfs settle t+2, so you need to be a bit more diligent about any early assignments.\n2. \"I rarely sell CSPs for the premium. The premium is part of it, but I am trying to increase my inventory in the majority of cases.\" - For others reading...That is exactly right. We think in terms of lowering our cost basis, not in terms of premium.\n3. I believe that robinhood only offers Reg-T margin? If that's true then I would consider throwing a super cheap long put under your CSP to make it a short vertical. When selling premium on single company options you are exposed to idiosyncratic risks that can hit hard and fast. Having that long put can save your life when it comes to margin requirements. As you know, the margin requirements on naked options are dynamic and can blow out exponentially if the trade really goes against you... And besides if you really wanted the stock at that price and the market falls right through that price level, such that the long put is in the money, then you can always sell it to lower your cost basis.\n4. If acquiring the stock at the cheapest price is the goal for a particular name, then consider selling a ratio backspread instead of a CSP.  it has similar characteristics, but you can oftentimes get more premium for the same breakeven price. and it helps, mentally, having that long put in front of the shorts...\n\nAs I mentioned, I'm new to the thread and don't know your skill level, so if my suggestions are remedial then I apologize, but I saw many here who are new to selling options, so I figured that they might benefit...\n\nThe previous commenter was not wrong... Selling options is very risky. You always have negative gamma...There is no panacea for making money in the markets... My advice to all readers is to fully understand the risks and learn how to manage them. Read your margin handbook. Understand the Greeks. Fully understand the relationship between volatility and option pricing and you will be fine...Failure to understand margin requirements or your obligations as an option seller can easily destroy your life...", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hi chyde13.
