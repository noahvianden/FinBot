{"title": "Tesla Tata / India Deal", "selftext": "It is some time in the past now but if you think like that the indian tech sector, the life qualities are raising in india every year. I saw this post of this guy talking about Indian investments and i remembered this news, i read something last week before the shareholder meeting too and my prediction is that a deal with india in this early development phase of the country is the perfect moment to get into Tesla. Of course not many of the 1.3b peope there can afford a tesla but maybe the target is a small and affordable tesla vehicle. Indians also pay a huge luxury tax on foreign importet Cars and if Elon manages to build a factory there or any type of deal with Tata this could be a big thing because Indians love western products. Indians are somehow super loyal and hardworking too. (ofc the ones that live in cities that study and hustle). I see a big opportunity to get into the indian market over a western company.\n\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/elon-musk-led-tesla-signs-strategic-deal-with-tata-electronics-for-semiconductor-chips-report/amp_articleshow/109298713.cms\n\n", "id": "1dh773z", "created_utc": 1718543165.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.45, "num_comments": 34, "comments": []}
