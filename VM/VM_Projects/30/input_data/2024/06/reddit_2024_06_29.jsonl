Nvidia lost 15 to 18 dollars worth of share price. In just two weeks.  That was before the huge earnings, stock split, and the announcement of blackwell and rubin.  Then in May and June, Nvidia  climbed very quickly.  If you look between January and late March, Nvidia climbed very quickly also, then in the beginning of April the stock started to level off and drop slowly at first then quickly at the end of the month.  It seems like a normal correction after running up for two to three months.  It seems a large reason is that share holders with large positions take large profits in a pattern after extended run ups.  I am hoping that process has finished and Nvidia is ready to run for a couple of months again. I hope this pattern continues for three to five years.  In the process Nvidia will become a 10 trillion company, Jensen will become a trillionaire, and many millionaires and billionaires will be made from the company.  Both through employment and stock ownership.  Remember during this downturn none of the basics have changed so far.  Nvidia has great leadership, current industry leader in GPU and AI chips, Great software, Even better products in the near future, fantastic sales, great financial records.
