{"title": "Call Ratio Back Spread: The perfect strategy for meme stocks before they moon?", "selftext": "https://preview.redd.it/2lzijkh3cr5d1.png?width=1541&format=png&auto=webp&s=764783c93588b7592010be4003454bd2c9451640\n\ntldr: The call backspread ratio seems like a good play for stocks that may be ready to moon or to sink. It takes advantage of the current low volatility on the call side before an event. This allows unlimited room for profit should the underlying shoot up suddenly, while still limiting risk.\n\n# BASICS\n\n**## WHAT**\n\nA **CALL RATIO BACKSPREAD** is a more advanced strategy involving selling a vertical call spread and buying extra long calls.\n\nIt is a very bullish strategy that benefits from large upside moves and increasing volatility.\n\n**## WHO**\n\nThis is not for AAPL or SPY. We are really only focusing on meme stocks before things get crazy. Or any stock that has the potential to moon in a short period. G·∏æE is the clear example. I theorize you could have run this basically at any point after the first fiasco before this recent pump, when things died down, and done fine, as long as you were managing it an rolling when needed.\n\n**## WHY**\n\nSo why would you use this strategy over, say, a simpler one. Essentially you don't know what will happen with the stock. There is a lot of hype around it and maybe a lot of excitement on other particular subs. So you could sell puts, buy calls, buy stock and sell CCs, etc. I could go over the downsides of all of these on meme stocks but to put it simply, only one of those strategies has unlimited upside potential and none of them have no downside risk.\n\n**## WHEN**\n\nPut this on before things get crazy. You could **not** do this in G·∏æE currently and probably wouldn't want to do this for some other stocks that have had their day. I will get into this more in specifics.\n\n**## HOW**\n\nTo setup this trade you SELL a VERTICAL SPREAD while buying another LONG CALL at the same strike as your VERTICAL LONG CALL. e.g. Stock is at 100 -> sell 1 CALL @ 110 strike & buy 2 CALLS @ 120 strike. That is a 1:2 ratio, but you could have any kind of ratio you want: 1:2, 1:3, 2:3, 5:8, etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zwhs07a4cr5d1.png?width=2948&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bbd924f6766496407a6b67addfd2fc01bc1281d\n\n# SPECIFICS\n\n**## GREEKS**\n\n**Delta**: You don't need to worry about delta. We don't care about being delta positive, negative, or neutral here. You will not hedge deltas.\n\n**Theta**: This trade should be put on for a small net credit. In theory that means it is theta positive. But in practice this is not so simple. Theta changes over time. If the stock stays in the same place for the entire trade it will go from negative to positive. But it can fluctuate between positive and negative depending on where you are on the graph.\n\n**Vega**: Positive to neutral. Your profit line will sink into the valley when IV goes down, but the further into the valley you are, the higher the Vega. We want Vega to increase on the underlying.\n\n**## STRIKES**\n\nA lot of folks like to put their short strike right ATM. I'm not a fan of that for this case, since small upward drift will cause max loss on the position. I prefer much further out strikes. Further OTM strikes lessens the initial negative theta because the drag from the valley is less harsh. At least +10% from the underlying on our short strikes. Since we are looking for extreme upward moves, we want to avoid getting caught in the top of a consolidation or channel.\n\n**## DTE**\n\nA longer DTE > 60 days is my preference. By using a much longer dated expiration we can eliminate the noise of the stock and just focus on the moonshot. This also allows you to roll easier.\n\n**## CREDIT**\n\nThe smaller the credit, the smaller max loss. The trade off being your possible ROC. I would try for about 6% of MAX RISK. Play around with the numbers to find what works for you.\n\n**## SKEW**\n\nThis is one of the more important parts of the setup to this trade. You need to look at the structure of the options chain for the same DTE. We are looking for a normal volatility SKEW on the CALL side to take advantage of the low IV of out of the money calls. This strategy aims to catch a meme stock before take off. A high SKEW environment makes it impossible to put on for a credit, since it means OTM calls are much more expensive than normal. If we look at G·∏æE right now, you will not be able to put this on for a credit.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b4es7n65cr5d1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bee214dbf08b5a7dd8c2817eb8dcd471960c52d\n\n**## VALLEY of DEATH**\n\nIn the location between your chosen strikes is the \"valley of death\". The valley of death will drag your profit line down on the left side (downside) of the graph, before expiration. This is why I'm proposing this as a meme stock play. Slow grinds up are not your friend here.\n\n**## RISKS**\n\nIf setup correctly for a **NET CREDIT**, there is NO DOWNSIDE RISK & LIMITED UPSIDE RISK. Your risk lies in the valley between your strikes and a little bit to the left of the valley before expiration. So your absolute risk in the trade is the width of the strikes minus the credit when you nail the absolute bottom of the valley.\n\n**PIN RISK** is a real issue should the stock not moon and hover just inside the valley. So just be aware and plan to close or roll well before expiration.\n\n**## OTHER THINGS**\n\nYou could also run a 2-2 1 which will cap your margin requirement and lower the valley of death to just a canyon of catastrophe. I kind of like this one better but it does require more contracts.\n\nThis could also be diagonalized to take advantage of a downward slop in the Term Structure.\n\n**## EXAMPLE**\n\nI just went over to WSB and looked for a DD. Found GNDR. It's the stupidest DD but it works as an example.\n\nVol SKEW for Aug 16th looks ok.

The OTM  gives you leverage and neglible theta decay and the ATM makes you shit tons of money. You can improve this strategy by rolling the weekly to the exact same strike for a loss until the stock comes back down. \n\nSo in this case I would buy $100 strike yearly for like $5 and sell the $25 weekly every week. In two weeks you will pay off the 100 strike. If you lose money on any week you roll to the next at the same strike and you pay probably $1-2 to buy yourself time for the stock to come back down.

The weekly IV is massive and there was never a Friday close above $30. Hypothetically if there was a Friday close at $50 you can roll to the next week at the $25 strike for less than $10. \n\nSo in literally the worst time to open a diagonal on a meme stock you would have made a profit if you continued to sell weeklies. \n\nFurthermore, suppose you entered this at $100/$10. You eat the the $15 loss initially but you make that back in about 3 weeks of selling the $25 strike. \n\nRemember that the $100 strike is only here for leverage purposes so whatever we paid is the cost of borrowing the funds necessary to run this position. \n\nThe profit is purely from selling the IV on a stock you believe to be delta neutral. In fact, the expected RV is irrelevant if you believe that the underlying will constantly cross your front month strike. Consider GameStop has infinite RV but it's mean price is $25.
