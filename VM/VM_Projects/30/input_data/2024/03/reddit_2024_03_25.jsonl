Cleanspark uses more clean energy which people like. Cleanspark has way more uptime than Mara, and a lower cost. I think people also like the fact that Cleanspark is very selective where they set up miners. They’re very local friendly in that regard, working with municipalities to create cohesion.\n\nI’m not invested in either one, but I don’t think it’s that clear which of the two is the better miner.
