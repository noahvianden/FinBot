Also I selected a lower premium just to lower any risk right now of being assigned and try a first covered call to see how it goes.\n\nThanks!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "First, make sure you read this guide, if you haven't already:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/\n\nLet me summarize the key advice in that guide: **Stock selection is 90% of the battle**. The Wheel works great if you pick a stock that basically only ever goes up, and defers losses for the few times it might go down. But if you pick a volatile stock or ETF that is all over the place, the Wheel is not the best way to trade that kind of stock. The Wheel is also not very good for very expensive stocks or ETFs, like NVDA or SPY, since it is a very capital-intensive strat.\n\n> I already own 100 shares of a safe dividend stock that has generally grown steadily throughout it's inception. Current stock price is about $160.\n\nIs there a reason you are keeping the ticker a secret? The reason I ask is because some very high dividend stocks, like say CVX, are not that good for covered calls, since the risk of early assignment is a little higher around exdiv dates, and  discounting for the dividends complicates entry strike selection.\n\nCan you afford $16k being tied up in a Wheel? If you end up in the CSP phase because the stock appreciated more than you expected, can you tolerate not getting the dividend or holding shares for months?\n\n> I'm going to use this as my entry to do a sell to open covered call with a strike price of $165 expiring in a week and a half. The OOTM probability is 90%, The premium is $0.26.\n\nWhy 165? What delta is that? An OOTM of 90% suggests something around 10 delta, which is awfully low. Something around 30 delta is more typical, assuming 30 to 45 DTE expiry. How does that premium compare to the dividend? Here's where knowing the ticker would have helped answer some of these questions.\n\nBTW, what expiration? You didn't say.\n\n> I'm going to do a buy to close on that position at $0.03. (I saw something on YouTube about setting an order to automatically close when you get to about 90% of profit to remove any risk of the stock raising above the strike price at the time of expiration)\n\nThat video is questionable. Waiting for 90% is riskier than the more conventional 50%. Plus, if you wait for 90%, you might as well wait for 100%, because on $.23 there isn't much difference between 90% and 100%.\n\n> If I do get assigned to sell my shares, I will use the $$$ to open a cash secured put on another stock TBD to continue this wheel strategy.\n\nWhy on *another* stock? That's not the Wheel, if that is your plan. The Wheel stays on the same ticker.\n\n> Reading some other threads, I see responses like that money can earn more interest in a savings or CD account.

Anyway, I was already owning these stocks to hold for a long time, and it was already doing nothing already. Also I selected a lower premium just to lower any risk right now of being assigned and try a first covered call to see how it goes.\n\nFirst, you have to make sure that the collateral on a CSP can be swept into an interest bearing bank account or MMF AND that the interest is worth it. Some brokers do, some don't. These are questions only your broker can answer.\n\nThere's no need for a calculator. You either get interest on the cash or you don't. If your broker doesn't provide this option, you need to decide if chasing interest on cash collateral is worth switching brokers.\n\nThis is all going to be moot once interest rates are down to 2% or lower anyway, so this is likely to be a concern for this year only, not next year.\n\n> Anyway, I was already owning these stocks to hold for a long time, and it was already doing nothing already.\n\n*Shares*, not stocks.

Why is like that? \n\nShort answer: Extrinsic value on the short leg is too high and/or too low on the long leg.\n\nAt expiration, neither contract has extrinsic value, it's all zeroed out. So all that matters, assuming both legs are ITM, is the difference in strike prices and the cost of the spread: max profit = spread width - opening debit. \n\nThat equation only works when there is no extrinsic value. When the legs have extrinsic value, the max changes. \n\nHere's an exaggerated example. Suppose the current extrinsic value of the short leg was $1 million. To close the whole spread, you're going to have to buy to cover at $1 million + intrinsic for the short leg part of it. Clearly, that would be a big loss for you, right? Now imagine that the *long leg* has $3 million in extrinsic value. All of a sudden the max profit on the spread as a whole is ginormous, on the order of $2 million.\n\nClearly, your extrinsic values won't get that high, but they might not move enough in the right direction (higher for the long leg, lower for the short leg), to keep your max profit at expiration.

This helps us understand the moneyness of the contracts.\n\n> From what I understand, the value will drop the closer it gets to the expiration date (theta decay, I believe).\n\nPartly true. **Part of the value** will drop the closer it gets to expiration date, the time value part. But if TSM shares go above 200 before expiration, there's a part, the intrinsic value, that won't decay away.\n\nSince both calls are OTM vs 147, all of the premium is time value, so technically your statement is correct given the current spot price, but this is why moneyness is so important to understand the status of a position.\n\n\n> Does that mean I should sell now (since I'm currently up ~400%)?

Note that a straddle is just a max-risk version of a strangle.\n\nCalendars are better for a mispricing in vol that is skewed by time. Like if the forecast realized vol for Apr and May is 30% and 35% respectively, but current prices are putting Apr at 40% IV and May at the expected 35% IV, this suggests that Apr vol is being overpriced relative to it's realized forecast, so a calendar with a short front leg and long back leg can exploit that skew.\n\nWhile IV also declines over time for earnings, it's not necessarily due to a mispricing of vol. As per [this post that explains estimating binary-event volatility](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1b95esz/event_pricing_for_an_option/), the decline in vol is more of a mathematical necessity due to uncertainty about the binary outcome.

It is commonly used by investors to determine whether a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued.\n\n Formula for P/E Ratio:-  Price Per Share / Earning Per Share\n\nKey Points About P/E Ratio:\n\n1. Interpretation:\n\n   - A high P/E ratio suggests that the market has high expectations for future growth and is willing to pay a premium for the stock.\n\n   - A low P/E ratio indicates that the stock may be undervalued or that the company is experiencing challenges.\n\n   \n\n2. Types of P/E Ratios:\n\n   - Trailing P/E: Based on the company's earnings over the past 12 months.\n\n   - Forward P/E: Based on analysts' forecasts for the company’s future earnings.\n\n\n\n3. Relative Valuation:\n\n   - The P/E ratio is often compared to industry peers or the overall market to assess relative valuation.\n\n   - A company with a P/E ratio higher than its peers might be considered overvalued, while a lower P/E might signal undervaluation.\n\n\n\n4. Limitations:\n\n   - Earnings Manipulation: Companies can sometimes manipulate earnings, making the P/E ratio less reliable.\n\n   - Different Industries: The average P/E ratio varies between industries. Comparing companies from different sectors using P/E alone may be misleading.\n\n   - Growth Expectations: High-growth companies often have high P/E ratios, but that doesn't always mean they are overvalued.\n\n\n\n5. Applications:\n\n   - Value Investors: Look for low P/E ratios, hoping to find stocks that are undervalued by the market.\n\n   - Growth Investors: Might focus on companies with high P/E ratios if they believe future earnings growth will justify the current price.\n\nTo find out lowest P/E Ratio Stocks in any market, you can use FINOLOGY TICKER platform.

I just didn't (and still don't) know how I could bet against the market and win when I see a loss coming. \n\nI'm just trying to learn more so that I can hopefully spot other opportunities like that in the future.
