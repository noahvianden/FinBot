Everyone who sees this and says, \"omg so wronnnngg!!! lol\" and has a good laugh about it.\n\nWhat people dont get about this is that a computer back then was technically the size of a house that in today's currency cost hundreds of millions for functionality that was basically a really hard to use calculator with limited functions. They sucked, were super expensive, and had minimal uses. She was actually correct. There was a total market for about 5 of them.\n\nSo what people miss is that she was actually correct using the definition of computers known in her day. Your commentary on AI will age exactly like hers. No, current AI will not be able to take her job. But AI and robotics in 30-100 years? I suppose there will be novelty for human nurses. But . . . It is completely possible and even likely future ai and robotics can replace nurse tasks. People in 100 years will view any comments regarding, \"But AI cannot replace X\" with the same attitude as, \"there is only a market for 5 computers total\". Technically true if you use a definition of AI and computers confined to that year.
