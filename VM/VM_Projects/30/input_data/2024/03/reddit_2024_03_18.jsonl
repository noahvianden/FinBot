I am trying to dig deeper and find out the literal monetary value I can expect from this decline?\n\nThe worst-case is 100% of the extrinsic value, although in practice it usually isn't just IV crush that would do that. So say you have a call with a premium bid of $3.00 and it's an OTM call, so all of the $3.00 is extrinsic value. The worst-case IV crush is that the call goes to $0.\n\n> Say I buy a 50% iv option for $2, and iv drops to 40%, is there a way I can calculate specifically what the new option price would be?\n\nNot solely from that information, no. However, using an option price calculator that lets you manually enter the IV value, like Option Price Calculator or optionstrat, that would get you in the ballpark. You just try it with 50% first and then with 40% and note the difference.\n\n> Additionally, does the negative of iv crush outweigh the positives of favorable price direction?\n\nMaybe. Sometimes delta dominates, sometimes vega dominates. It depends on other factors, like the moneyness of the contract and the size of the price move of the underlying. If you are starting out at 80 delta with a call, a $1 move is going to have a bigger impact on total premium than a deep OTM call with only 8 delta. Plus, the 80 delta call will usually have less extrinsic value to lose to IV crush anyway.\n\nYou can get an idea for how much you are risking from IV crush by looking at current IV compared to historical IV. If IV is higher than average, you have more risk of IV crush. The higher it is above the average, the higher the risk.

While there are many ways to be a successful trader, being an emotion-free robot that mechanically enters/exits at fixed dollar targets removes one of the biggest contributors to trading mistakes: cognitive biases, like loss aversion or anchoring.\n\nOptions trading is a numbers game. You will be more successful shooting for achievable averages over many trades than trying to get lucky in one big yolo. So once you decide to shoot for averages over many trades, consistent/mechanical trading patterns are what deliver your edge.\n\nThe time factor you mentioned ought to be a part of the initial plan. Of all the various risk factors in trading, time decay is the *easiest* to deal with, since you know exactly what is going to happen up front. You can't say the same about, for example, volatility. You can adapt the trade to the desired holding time, with time decay in mind.\n\n> I also feel like setting stop losses and take profits for actual options contract just doesn't work well, as the contract can move 50% up or down in one day.\n\nBut that's a good thing on the profit side, right?

You just need to address your FOMO and stop worrying about gains that you didn't get, those are irrelevant and not under your control anyway. Again, the mechanical mindset works best here, because you will never have to worry about missing out on excess gains. You won't know or care.\n\nOn the other hand, you are right about stops not being very effective. You can improve your chances for stops working by only trading highly liquid contracts with tons of price discovery, but that's a pretty narrow range of contracts. So you either have to just accept the imperfection of stops and adjust your plans accordingly (maybe you accept bigger loss targets to average out the noise, like ideally you want a 10% stop but you use a 15% stop to account for the times it jumps from -8% to -16%), or don't use stops at all and instead use alerting and manual exit actions to manage the downside.\n\nEither way, you should not trade strats that are super-sensitive to loss exits. Avoid strats where the difference between a 10% loss and a 11% loss is the difference between profitability and unprofitability.\n\n> and I said that if the stock reaches 180, I take profits\n\nThat was a mistake. You should base your profit/loss exits on the **bid of the contract itself**, not the stock price.

The higher that quote is, the more excess premium there is. All else equal, a call with 80% IV is going to be comparatively more expensive than a call with 20% IV. But just because IV is high doesn't mean the excess is uncalled for. Calls on NVDA will have a lot of excess premium because the market believes that premium will be justified in the future.\n\nNote that many people, mistakenly in my opinion, use VIX as a catchall substitute for the IV of a contract. If VIX is high, say more than 30, their theory is that means all contracts are expensive, because VIX is the volatility index for SPX, and SPX is the S&P 500, and if the stock is in the S&P 500, VIX *probably* represents it. It's the *probably* that I have a problem with, since in an average with 500 constituents, one stock can easily be an outlier.\n\nYou can then compare the IV of today to the historical average for IV by using [IV Rank or IV Percentile](https://www.projectfinance.com/iv-rank-percentile/), one or both of which may be quoted by your broker for each strike. An IV Rank of 80% means today's IV is much higher than average.\n\nFinally, the way to nail down if today's IV is **overpriced** relative to the probable outcome for the contract, which is where the real action in options trading happens, you have to get into volatility forecasting and make a better forecast than the market.

I'd like to pick very few diversified companies that I can put my money in for the next 20-30y. My ideal would be to put 100% of my money in BRK.B (or tbh in Markel, but you get the point). My concern is that they're almost entirely US, and their returns have tended to be very closely correlated to the S&P500. So if the US large cap market doesn't do well, then neither will they.\n\nNow that brings me to my two concerns:\n\n(1) The US: I'm cynical about the US market long-term because the US has collected a great advantage from the USD being the world's reserve currency... At the moment there's no real alternative. But if people move off SWIFT and the USD reserves, then American financial markets will lose a big advantage.\n\n(2) The large caps in the US. P/E ratios are way high, compared to historic norms. I suspect that the run-ups of the last decade are not super sustainable, and that investors will move to small caps and move out of the US to find opportunities.\n\nOne final point - I am a bit of a prepper. If there's a total mess in the US, my money would go down a lot if I had it all in BRK. That's also true in Europe, but at least if it's a mess here, my portfolio won't collapse below my purchasing power!\n\n*TL;DR: Basically, I'm not interested in 100% European.

To be honest with you, I actually wrote my thesis essentially in opposition to him, because of that question - what's the alternative?\n\nBut my view is that the US leadership position will start to matter less. The era of superpowers with hegemonic spheres of influence is over. We had the USSR and the US for about 50 years, and the US has kept its leadership position in the last 25 years in the wake of the USSR's collapse through inertia. But how is that sustainable? The US can't keep on running the rest of the world's defence, leading supposedly democratic international institutions, etc. We consider it a cute little tradition that an American heads the World Bank and a European heads the IMF. I don't think Africans find that a cute little tradition.\n\nOther countries are getting tired of it! Consider the Ukraine war - other than Western Europe (where the US has a sphere of influence), very few others joined the anti-Russian sanctions. China didn't, India didn't, LatAm and African countries didn't. They'd all prefer to be on the Belt and Road Initiative than on the teat of the World Bank. And the second those regions see a chance to build a new financial infrastructure that doesn't include the US, they absolutely will.\n\nCountries no longer want superpowers where all the world's money flows. They want independence. Globalisation went very far, very fast, and I think we're going to see the pendulum swing the other way. Liberal democracy is trending down, intergovernmental organisations are trending down, free trade is trending down. I don't think it's a stretch to say that the US-led financial system is going to go the same way.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The majority of this site suffers from Dunning-Kruger, so I'm out.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I wrote a bit more about this on [a different comment chain here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1bhpwjk/european_berkshire_hathaway_investment_holding/kvjx9qp/) But yeah, fully agree with you that China won't be the next big thing. India has a better runway but they've got maybe 50y to go and will need some serious infrastructure improvements and economic reform. As I said, I wrote my thesis in opposition to some of his claims - but that doesn't mean that he doesn't make some claims that are worth investigating. A better book on the more political level is Fareed Zakaria's Post-American World, but that's now quite old and is less finance related.\n\n> Neither China nor India have really ever been US allies. LatAm and Africa also don't really typically go along with US initiatives, either. The 20 year average coincidence rate for votes with the US in the UN is like 30%.\n\nThis is what I think is important - we moved from a bipolar world (US / capitalism or USSR / communism, you choose) to a unipolar world (everything revolves around the US). I suspect we are moving to a multipolar world, where the global liberal institutions and systems will matter less and Realpolitik will matter more.\n\n> They need to view any competing financial infrastructure as more stable and reliable. That's the beauty of the USD being the reserve currency - it's remarkably predictable.\n\n100% - there's no alternative at the moment. As you point out, nobody wants to move the world system onto Chinese financial infrastructure, nor the Euro, nor anything else. But don't forget, the reason that the US is reliable and predictable is because everyone keeps buying US assets. The second that stops, the US needs to start inflating their money like crazy to pay off debts.\n\nWe know that, compared to the real economy, US assets are overpriced at the moment (with inertia from the USD's status they have continued to make returns regardless.) Over the next decade, perhaps seeing more opportunities in non-US geographies, perhaps triggered by nationalist policies, let's say investors start to move their assets to other markets (perhaps simply to cheaper markets like West Europe and ANZ, perhaps to markets with more real economic growth opportunities than the US, like SE Asia and CEE). US equity all of a sudden doesn't have the advantage it does, US debt needs to up its rates to attract money, the USD needs to inflate by 30-60%ish to hit a reasonable value. Even if we aren't talking crisis, the US has a long runway to underperform.\n\nBuying US stocks is like buying a company with a 50x P/E. Sure, you could make great returns: There's a reason investors gave it this high a rating and honestly, on average, you probably made better returns doing that over the last few decades than you did by buying companies at a 5x P/E. But at a 5x P/E, there's no way but up. At a 50x P/E, you could grow your revenue 10% annually for a decade and increase your margins by 50% and still make 0 returns just by compressing to 13x.\n\nAs to your questions at the end:\n\n* Yes, liberal democracy is trending down at a global level. You can see some stats on Wikipedia's page on \"[democratic backsliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding),\" or look at the most popular ranking, [Freedom in the World](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2022/global-expansion-authoritarian-rule), which has registered 16 years straight of decline. And yes, that's the case in the West too. 2020 was the first time in US history that there was a serious dispute about the quality of the US elections, and European populists have demonstrated that there is serious dissatisfaction with the liberal democratic institutions that have predominated in the last 100 years.\n\n* Intergovernmental organisations' import is hard to measure and hard to explain. For example, I don't really think UN resolutions do anything, but on the other hand, the EU, the IMF, and NATO obviously all have more hard power. But I think that they are symptomatic of US hegemony, and their decline demonstrates a general trend in international politics.\n\n* Free trade is going upward in terms of dollar amounts, but growth is slowing a lot ([IMF source](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2023/06/superpowers-are-forsaking-free-trade-ngaire-woods), [World Bank source](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/voices/global-trade-has-nearly-flatlined-populism-taking-toll-growth#:~:text=Trade%20growth%20will%20improve%20this,of%20growth%20since%20the%201990s.)). Take a look at attitudes of US politicians - being pro free-trade was a consensus position from the Marshall Plan till maybe the GFC, then it became a dispute, then Trump applied the dispute to policies, and now the Democrats and the Republicans *both* want to restrict free trade! (CHIPS Act and the forced sale of TikTok being the most recent examples.) In Europe, I don't think free trade has ever been as much of a consensus position, but with the EU we were moving in that direction, and it's now placing more and more restrictions on imports from outside of the bloc, as well as itself becoming less popular and powerful.\n\nOverall though, I want to re-emphasise something I said earlier:\n> I'm not interested in 100% European. I'm just interested in NOT being 100% US!\n\nI don't think that the US is a bad market to be in.

Europe is falling behind in almost every economic metric. Their AI is non-existant and they only rely on colonial and historic companies to do their heavy lifting for them.

I agree with you that America has broadly been a more attractive market to invest in compared to Europe (e.g., Eurozone returns over last 50y have surely been worse than the US). However, America's regulation has pretty consistently gotten worse over that time. At the same time, a few markets in the Eurozone (Nordics, Baltics, Netherlands, Germany) have improved a lot. And, obviously, countries like Australia and New Zealand, Singapore, Switzerland, and Luxembourg are also very attractive. As proof of my statements, check out the Heritage Foundation's [Index of Economic Freedom](https://www.heritage.org/index/pages/all-country-scores), which has America ranked 25th in the world and dropping.\n\nEither way, my cynicism about the US is not based on regulation, but more on the status of the USD as world reserve currency - we don't know how long that will stay that way... At the moment there's no real alternative. But if people move off SWIFT and the USD reserves, then American financial markets will lose a big advantage they've had for a while. And there are other fears I have about the US - I can easily see serious political problems causing a collapse. Now, I can see the same thing happening in Europe (though to a lesser extent - lower polarisation and inequality). But, if I keep my money closer to home, it is at least safer relative to my purchasing power. And honestly? It just feels \"right,\" rather than outsourcing.\n\nAnd most importantly: Investing in a company like Berkshire (which would be my ideal) essentially means exposing yourself to the S&P 500.

That said, given you're from Europe, you may not be aware of just how much red tape exists in the US. I ran a business in the US, and it was absolute hell to deal with the IRS and the regulations. Australia was much, much easier, and good chunks of Europe are easier too (the Netherlands for sure, I hear Scandinavia is, I admit German paperwork doesn't sound fun but trust me, it's still better than American stuff). Even worse for them is the trend against skilled migrants: a friend of mine grew up in the US (on his parents' visa) and ended up working at JP Morgan in NY, where he was a top-bucket analyst and then associate on an H1B. Every year, they tried to sponsor him for a green card, but he lost the random draw all three years of the H1B, so ended up having to move to London. Insanity! This is not a positive direction to be moving. America has an identity of capitalism - but that identity no longer reflects reality.\n\nAs to the statement that the US is more innovative, effective at allocating capital, whatever - that is all true but is *because* the capital flows there. They maintain their leadership position *because* they are the historical leader. (Check out that comment I linked above if you want to read more about my view on this.) If you hadn't had the Marshall Plan and Bretton Woods, the US wouldn't make up 50% of the world's public equity (as it does today). I think that the world order will move towards the liberalism and country independence that the US has always claimed to espouse. The rest of the world will not be a happy vassal of the US.\n\nIt's also not just the Netherlands that's moving towards curbing immigration. Even if they don't win the elections, parties like AfD, FP√ñ, National Rally, La Liga, whatever, will greatly shape European politics in the next few decades - the mainstream politicians need to meet the populist demands to reduce Middle Eastern migration flows or the populists will just keep on growing.
