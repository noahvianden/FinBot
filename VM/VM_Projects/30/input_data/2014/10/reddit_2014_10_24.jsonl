There were several items lately that I actually found cheaper at Bestbuy and other stores. \n\nAs a company, they are losing money on Prime. The shipping alone is a big hurt, not to mention the licensing needed for all of the movies and shows. The Kindle has done well for them and probably will continue to do so but you can't help but notice the Fire tablet and phone lineup.\n\nWith TSLA and NFLX I can see future growth which probably explains why they jumped so well and so quickly, I am not as optimistic about Amazon in the short term.

For example, if I'm just buying a book I want to read in the near future I'm in no hurry so why not get an extra $1 that can go towards another book? On the other hand I just got a new phone and I liked having more case options (and prices) from Amazon than Target.

I am not buying but I think there will be at some point a pop... \n\nLook at the chart here: http://i.imgur.com/pCuOj5Q.png\n\nIf you notice after the last few disappointing earnings we saw a few down days followed by a pop when the downtrend was broken. I expect very similar trading to occur this time, I'd continue to draw this trend line and if you are bullish look for an exit (or at least buy protection once we get to it).\n\nI did not get long puts this earnings because implied vol was too high. Despite a huge move puts aren't much much as implied vol is getting crushed. Going forward your advantage and your opportunity will be to get long puts if this thing pops and once it gets near the trend line. \n\nI'm not saying to go out and buy this stock today, as it could and likely will trade lower. I'm watching closely. But your opportunity and trade will come if this thing rallies back up to the trend line in the chart I've drawn and you buy some protection, my guess is it will be dirt cheap at that point to buy and regardless if you are bullish or bearish you will want to take advantage of that either to start a position or hedge your bullish position. \n\nedit: if you have to buy or are looking to get long, look to this chart as it should form a pattern much like it did prior which will likely cause a pop. see here: http://i.imgur.com/iHuXSLi.png But again, please sell or at least buy protection into that main downtrend line.

I know it's a very narrow-minded point-of-view, but I could've called the failure of the Fire Phone way before it hit shelves. \n\nTo bring input into the conversation, I'd hold off on AMZN until they can show that promise that their innovations aren't dumb and can return a profit.
