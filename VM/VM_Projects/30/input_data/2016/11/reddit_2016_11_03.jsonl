Qualified dividends are taxed at a significantly lower rate than capital gains are. This represents value for investors to realize the value of the company as income that can be spent or reinvested.  \nOn the other side, dividends represent a financial motivator for companies, and this has been measured and proven time and again.  \nMore generally, investment in equity ownership has only the endgame of realized earnings through dividends. The price paid for a company is the expectation that it will eventually pay you back. Equities offer a significant value for investors over bonds, as these yields are unlimited both in time and quantity. Because of this risk and interest, prices for ownership reflect greater market cap for a company as it raises dividends (inline with ability to realistically and regularly pay them). This is important if the company would like to sell additional shares to raise money for a growth opportunity.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "AMD", "score": -5, "replies": [{"body": "AMD does not currently pay a dividend.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}
