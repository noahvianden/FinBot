What's your point?

People (institutional investors) are more confident about where they put their money. They're also more willing to take risks with small-mid cap stocks (The movement in the Russel Index is very telling of this). \n\nI'm not saying AMD won't experience a pullback, but I don't think this is the kind of trade where the odds are in your favor. It's a bet, nothing more.\n\n\nEdit: also, what drop in August? Are you referring to the dilution in September? Because that's not a pullback- they found plenty of buyers at a diluted value, and are now at new highs after said dilution. The bull case for AMD is strong, albeit speculative.
