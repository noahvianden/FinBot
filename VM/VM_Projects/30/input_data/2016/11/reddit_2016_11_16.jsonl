Many have it much higher than this.\n\nAdditionally, Regeneron, a pharmaceutical giant in the ophthalmology space, recently entered into a deal with Ocular Therapeutix for the use of their platform. Upon reaching certain milestones with the clinical testing of Regeneron's drug, Ocular Therapeutix may receive two payments of 150m (one for each milestone).

The Trump administration plans on reducing the stringency of the requirements to gain FDA approval, something this drug had already nearly achieved.
