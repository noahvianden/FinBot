I tend to base my decisions on fundamental analysis so any thoughts opposed to it can only help me in my DD.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Happy to explain, but here's some necessary background on what I think:\n\n* I don't believe that fundamentals are the primary attributing factor of stock performance on time frames <10 years\n* I believe we will have another major market dislocation within the next 10 years\n\nBecause of the above two points, I see no reason to invest based on fundamentals. \n\nI'm 26, so I have a loooong time frame. I have a career in finance, so I'm a bit more plugged-in than the average joe. I believe that I'll have an opportunity to create a long-term portfolio at ***much*** cheaper valuations at some point in the next 10 years.\n\nWhy is this important? In a word, CAPE. It stands for cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings ratio. It is the single best predictor of forward returns for equities. There's a wealth of research behind it and one of it's creators, Robert Schiller, shared the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on it. In it's simplest terms, your 10 year forward returns are highly explainable by the cyclically adjusted P/E of the market when you buy in.\n\nRight now, valuations are far too rich for the amount of growth actually being achieved in the world. I'm not comfortable buying a long term portfolio at these valuations.\n\nSo what to do? Well, I trade options using a variety of strategies to generate return while I wait. I generally have a mix of volatility-based trades and directional trades on at any given time. I use technical analysis for the directional trades, and, if you know what you're doing, it works.\n\nWhy does it work? Well, imo, it works because psychological factors and behavioral biases drive price trends in the short term and patterns help you identify those factors. It's by no means an exact science - if I see a bullish chart pattern, I don't say to myself \"OMG THIS STOCK HAS TO GO UP!\" I take a probabilistic view: based on price action, this stock has X% probability of moving higher and I believe the market is pricing in Y%. If I see an attractive volume profile in addition to an attractive chart pattern it moves the needle even further. It's a relative process, not an absolute one.\n", "score": 15, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I expect $NVDA to go down and $AMD to go up.
