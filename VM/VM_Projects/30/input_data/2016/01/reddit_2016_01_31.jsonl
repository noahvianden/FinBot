TA is helped by simple math being in it's favor.  In order to push a stock up $10, when it's average volume is ~10M shares means an increase of $100M interest increase over that time (I'm oversimplifying) on top of it's current market.  Since there isn't a limitless well of money prices will move along certain lines at certain times.  In other words it takes exponential increase of interest/money to move a stock higher, so at some point the money runs out and it happens as people decide based on the expected return of the stock, not market data.  In your example some people who do look at the data pull their money.  That will affect the price and WMT will lose some steam causing others to also pull their money and chase the changing trend at AMZN.

Moving averages, resistance points, VWAP, etc. It's a way to find your bearings. It's very important to note that techincal analysis indicators are not a measure of fundamentals, and therefore you can't use logic about a company to explain why someone would buy at the 50 day moving average for example.\n\nSo lets say you wanted to buy a stock that has had a pullback. Well you can just buy anywhere and hope for the best, but most like to have some sort of marker of when to buy. All of a sudden it's coming down to the 50 day moving average, and you know traditionally that is a level of support for stocks. So you set your order in at the 50dma, and so do hundreds of others. And of course it bounced off of it, and then it's a matter of if it holds. So basically it's like when you see a bunch of fishing boats in a small area because its a vast ocean out there and there is some consensus on where it's good to fish.\n\nNow this is why you can have these massive swings in the market, and it's especially volatile in a down market. Because charts become broken, and it's hard to find support (areas where people will likely buy). When you have stocks go through their 50 day, 200 day, and multiple areas of support you end up in limbo.
