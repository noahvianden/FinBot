Amazon could not be aggressively expanding if the company was unprofitable for 15 years. Which would mean Amazon had a negative P/E for the last 15 years give or take. In reality, they were reinvesting every dollar they made into expanding and growing. Optimizing leverage and loans.\n\nThe Next part is half truth, half educated guess. I'm hoping someone steam rolls my explanation and give the whole truth. (I read somewhere \"provide the wrong answer and someone will be there to correct you on the internet\")\n\nSome much smarter people started calculating Amazon's P/E ratio using GAAP numbers in order to formulate a consensus on the company because at *best* they would derive a 999.  The issue is where to draw the line as what can be considered normal R&D-Growth and what level Amazon was doing... Would a company really be spending XY amount of cash on growth or AB amount of cash in normal circumstances, where do you draw the line? So they came up with some Magic numbers and over time it's averaging down as the company is slowing their expansion and actually taking in profits. I've seen the ratio drop from 500 to 330 to 125 to 90.... and probably someone a lot smarter than me will calculate it tonight and it will be like 75 tomorrow.\n\nTLDR: Amazon's P/E ratio is bullshit fabricated as they've been reinvesting all their earnings into growth and expansion.
