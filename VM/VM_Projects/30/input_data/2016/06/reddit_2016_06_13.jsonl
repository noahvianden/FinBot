{"title": "Real DD: Short WFM", "selftext": "I'll show you why from a corporate strategy perspective WFM isn’t 100% on point and will be adding the “365” stores too slowly, look at the chart to see a good entry point, and then pick some options to put your money in.\n\n**Corporate Strategy context**\n\na.\tHistorically, WFM is a high margin business, but has been facing competition on many fronts (i.e., traditional grocers moving into organic, WMT & TGT growing their grocery business) causing it lose business.  Bad publicity - causing it to be known as Whole Check – also contributed to this.  They are weak in product selection once you leave the organic food categories.  If you want coke (the drink) you’ll have to go elsewhere\n\nb.\tOTOH, visiting their stores is a positive experience and the staff is very friendly and goes out of their way to help.  The prepared food section is a driver to get people in the door and a key strength of the chain\n\n\n\n**Corp Strategy going forward**\n\na.\tNew strategy is to launch the “365” stores that are ~ 2/3 the size of the current stores, staffed by about ½ the # of people and integrate local, 3rd party experiences in the “Friends of 365” concept (e.g., eateries, tattoo shops [LOL], coffee, tea, etc.)\n\nb.\tThere will only be about 25% of the # SKUs vs. the original stores\n\n\nc.\tRecent posts indicate the 365 stores will be ~ 20% lower on a basket of goods vs existing stores, but are still nowhere near TGT and WMT\n\n\nd.\tAll this leads to controlled costs, but sacrifices the personal experience to achieve share holder friendly higher margins\n\n\ne.\tIn sum, reasonable strategy and with tweaks they may strike a balance between margin and experience, but will only stop customers from leaving rather than growing the pie\n\n\nf.\tAs it stands with the current 365 growth plans (expected to be 10-20 stores in the next 12-24 months), this is not going to have a material effect on the bottom line any time soon\n\n**Looking at the chart: http://i.imgur.com/2PUdSct.jpg**\n\n\na.\tI marked up a ~ 1 yr chart using tradingview.  You can see the periodic nature of the price\n\n\nb.\tIt’s about to take a leg down IMO based on the above fundamentals and its historic performance\n\n\nc.\tEarnings are due out on July 27th .  You can see from the last two earnings dates that WFM took a leg up after earnings.  I’m exiting my position before earnings\n\n\nd.\tThis gives us about 6 weeks and defines the exit point\n\n**Picking an option**\n\n\na.\tShort term Options are mostly liquid. I’ve provided a general exit point and a direction\n\n\nb.\tI’m buying puts.  Alternatively, a cheaper & capped gain strategy would be put spreads\n\n\nc.\tIV constellation via OptionsHouse http://i.imgur.com/6mXNu3D.jpg.  I like the July 22nd because of the very low IV and its pre earnings\n\n\nd.\tOptions chain for the July 22 contracts http://i.imgur.com/dHdvSLT.jpg has pretty large bid/asks\n\n\ne.\tMoving a week later, you’ll notice how the bid/ask increases even more for the July 29th contracts http://i.imgur.com/HO6YTLu.jpg STAY AWAY.  I don’t want to pay for IV caused by earnings on the 27th \n\n\nf.\tJuly 15th though, looks great from a IV, bid/ask, OI and volume perspective http://i.imgur.com/llMrC41.jpg WE HAVE A WINNER\n\n\ng.\tGiven the short term to expiry and bc generally options price starts being overtaken by theta decay three weeks out, I’m inclined to buy the $33 put contract and sell within two to three weeks\n\n\nI'm long puts.  \n", "id": "4nvtq1", "created_utc": 1465827547.0, "score": 40, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 39, "comments": [{"body": "I forgot to mention . . .
