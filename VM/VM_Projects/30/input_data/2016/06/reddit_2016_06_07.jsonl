Nvidia, AMD, Intel all crushed this quarter. Applied Materials (that makes shit for the semi conductor business) released their earnings after the previous 3. I made 500% off calls on AMAT.\n\nNow it's time for Verifone to crush earnings. Their european counterpart, Ingenico Group went up 8% 3 days after earnings... and European companies are all garbage.\n\nDo a google image search for verifone. With the new chip readers, every fucking store in the world is going to be switching to new Verifone readers. I'll bet my dick that you've had to use their new chip readers recently.\n\nGo fuck yourself and buy some $26 calls.
