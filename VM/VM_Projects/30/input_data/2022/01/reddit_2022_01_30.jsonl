The exception is when there is massive open interest immediately prior to expiry, which could have the impact of either squeezing or pinning. It's still useful for longer term trades (holding time of days to weeks) and I have seen analysis write ups from hedge funds and investment banks who usually end up bar plotting something very similar to GEX at one specific day versus strike/delta/moneyness to inform their trades.\n\nFor the shorter term trader, official data usually has to be combined or replaced with live trade data to keep it up to date. For these types of traders, you'd be seeing open interest in a few ways.
