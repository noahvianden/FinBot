I screwed up by forgetting VIX is standard deviation and moves are variance, should've used 1.7\\^2 \\* 60 bps and we would get 180 bps bounce. Oh well. Retace of the VIX and SPX is probably done now and we go to VIX 60 in the next few days.\n\n**Update: 4:00 pm:** Huge volatile action today gave us a good idea of a support/resistance dynamic for the next couple of weeks. High likelihood we get a selloff towards 200 DMA of around 4420. Then a bounce wedneday afternoon as fed tweaks language to slightly less bearish, and then we go down to 3600.  Still targeting 3600 for the near term big support zone, once we hit that, we will likely bounce back up to 4200 towards mid feb before dropping off to 2000 into late feb/early march. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cd4a972eapd81.png?width=2281&format=png&auto=webp&s=384cbc7596caf428613cbb76fcc6a2b15154395e\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "sboq57", "created_utc": 1643038185.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "Why wouldn’t we just find support at 4275.50?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "because of long liquidation as hedging costs explode.

{"title": "GME will go down then up", "selftext": "As we all know, Microsoft has just recently acquired Activision for $69 Billion USD.  This new asset now brings to multiple game studios with some HUGE franchise names to the Xbox team.  There is speculation that new games from these franchises will become console exclusive to Xbox.  Here is a current image of their current game studios they now own.  There is also the possibility that many of the new titles from these games could become Day 1 GamePass titles.  \n\nIf we take all of this news into consideration, the only bad news is for Sony fans.  They now have less game choices and less value to their consoles.  GamePass has always been an INSANE value for the price, but now with these new studios, it increased exponentially.  Which leads to my next point.\n\nMicrosoft purchases GameStop\n\nIt would be the next option to take even more money from Sony.  The new GameStop stores could be a combo of their current versions but also include more Windows/Microsoft products, or they could leave them alone for the time being to save on renovation costs.  Now that Microsoft would own a large amount of the actual games sold in a store, they would now be making money on Sony's items also.  They could always just stop selling Sony items, but that would just push the customers someplace else.  This move would mean Microsoft will profit regardless of the customer choosing Xbox or Playstation.  \n\nGamestop has had immense support in recent times.  They got Ryan Cohen to help lead them and they have plans on expanding their offerings.  With Microsoft's backing and other expertise, it could help their future plans become a successful reality.  GameStop has also Missed their Q2 and Q3 earnings which brings this even closer to a possibility.  I'm probably just losing braincells because my tinfoil hat is blocking the 5G, but I think it's the clear path for GME to go to the moon.\n\nThis pushes Sony to do something that can outweigh the positives that Microsoft has.  Sony has also raised their PS5 game prices up to $69.99 where Xbox kept them at $60.  Microsoft offers gamepass, where Sony has nothing to compete.\n\nThe only people to profit are the consumers.", "id": "sbp60k", "created_utc": 1643039393.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.45, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "Imagine being too retarded for WSB.", "score": 23, "replies": []}, {"body": "The hopium in this post is next level retarded", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "The OP is freebasing unadulterated medical-grade hopium fresh from the Golden Triangle.", "score": 9, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Damn, it's at 90 already", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "GME is dropping like a stone, and it is so wonderful to see!

Might be time to take a break from the main floor of the casino and play the penny slots for a while. \n\nThis is only going to get worse before it gets better. Here are some of my thoughts: \n\n\n1. Interest rates rise, prices fall. Interest rates are poised to rise 4 times this year and the fed can’t afford not to raise rate due to inflation. \n\n2. Inflation. They can’t run the money printer forever and if the fed wants to reign this in, they will need to continue to raise interest rates. \n\n3. Mortgage debt. How many people do you know that bought a house in the past year or 2? This past summer saw an intense buying spree with people offering $100k+ over asking in some areas. Real estate was also propped up by the iBuyers (which are now taking massive losses). Also see point 1.\n\n4. Student debt. Good ‘ol uncle campaigned on erasing at least some student loans, but has since reversed course and it looks like payments could legitimately resume in May. If those same people that haven’t been paying their student loans have also been buying homes at the top range of allowable DTI levels, then you might see some folks attempting to downsize. Those folks might come to the unflattering realization that they aren’t able to sell their homes for the same ridiculous prices they paid over this past summer. \n\n5. Covid/supply chain issues - nothing new here, but certainly compounds the issues above\n\n6. China / Evergrande - if you haven’t heard of Evergrande, it’s a massive real estate company in China that is defaulting on hundreds of billions of dollars of debt. This is going to send shockwaves through China and beyond. \n\n7.
