We're headed for a severe recession by end of the year. Consumers are spending beyond their means on credit cards. People are spending 99% of their wages on food, rent and gas.\n\nThere's a major disconnect from reality. Not sure if the painting of a dark future is politically motivated, talking their book, or just sheep that look at charts to try and predict the future.  Sure Seattle, WA is not Muskogee, OK...but I bet even Tulsa, OK is seeing a lot of consumer spending.  Strikes me as the doom and gloom talking heads are the same ones who , in Nov 2021, prognosticated a bright 2022 with global rebound as the world reopened.
