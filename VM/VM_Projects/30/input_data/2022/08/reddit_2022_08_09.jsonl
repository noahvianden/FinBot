A week ago, it looked like they might ease up, but after Friday‚Äôs red-hot jobs number and the passage of the \\[Inflation Reduction Act\\], I‚Äôm worried they might lower the boom on us even before September comes,‚Äù he said.\n\n‚ÄúIf both numbers are scorchers, we will get a surprise August meeting,‚Äù he predicted, referencing the consumer price index and producer price index data coming this week.\n\nThe Senate on Sunday passed the Inflation Reduction Act, a Democrat-backed package aimed at fighting climate change and extending health care coverage.\n\nThe legislation, among other provisions, allows Medicare to negotiate prices with drug companies and puts a 15% minimum tax on large corporations.\n\nThe July jobs report saw stronger-than-expected numbers last week, meaning the central bank could have to continue its path forward on raising interest rates aggressively.\n\n‚ÄúIf I were Chairman Jay Powell ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd be hard-pressed not to call a special Fed meeting this month to hit us with another 75-basis point rate hike,‚Äù Cramer said. A basis point equals 0.01 percentage point.\n\nInvestors are also looking to the University of Michigan‚Äôs consumer sentiment index this week to shed more light on how consumers are coping with inflation.\n\nCramer also previewed this week‚Äôs slate of earnings.

This seems highly unlikely.\n\nEarlier in the year RBLX signaled that they expected the summer to be an opportunity for growth. There are indications that the opposite happened.\n\nThere are websites that track user activity across Roblox. This data is far from perfect, but it has previously served as an indication of change in user activity. This data suggests June having lower activity than May and July having even lower activity.
