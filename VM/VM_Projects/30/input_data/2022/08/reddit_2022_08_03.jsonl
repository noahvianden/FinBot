Istanbul, Turkey‚Äôs most populous city, saw price growth exceed 99% in July from a year earlier. \n\nKey policy rate, annual price growth\n  \nEven in a world consumed by the fastest inflation in decades, Turkey is an outlier that ranks behind only a handful countries like Zimbabwe, Venezuela and Lebanon, where the pace of price increases has already topped triple digits.\n\nLoosening inflation‚Äôs grip is proving harder to achieve in Turkey because the central bank has refrained from raising its key rate from 14% under pressure from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The Turkish leader believes -- contrary to mainstream economics -- that higher rates cause faster inflation. \n\n‚ÄúWe see no signs of a stabilization in the macroeconomic environment for Turkey arising from the current unorthodox monetary policy settings and recommend refraining from investing in Turkish assets,‚Äù said Nenad Dinic, emerging markets equities strategist at Bank Julius Baer. \n\nThe approach has put Turkish policy makers out of sync with the most aggressive global monetary tightening since the 1980s and pushed the country‚Äôs rates deeply below zero when adjusted for prices.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Economics Says... \n\n‚ÄúUnanchored expectations and a weakening lira are feeding further into prices. We don‚Äôt expect the central bank to tighten interest rates in response to ever rising inflation -- instead, the political leadership is calling for even lower rates.‚Äù\n\n--Selva Bahar Baziki, Turkey economist. Click here for more. \n\nErdogan is intent on keeping the economy powering ahead at a rapid clip ahead of elections scheduled for next June, even as the run-up in consumer costs eats into disposable incomes and threatens his popularity. \n\nSpeaking last week, central bank Governor Sahap Kavcioglu sounded confident that the so-called new economy model that prioritizes production, exports and employment will help stabilize prices and the lira.\n\nTurkish authorities have instead relied on macroprudential measures like curbing commercial loan growth as well as policies aimed at widening the use of the local currency and channeling capital toward long-term investment.\n\nThe results are playing out in the currency market, with the lira down more than a quarter of its value against the dollar, this year‚Äôs biggest loss in emerging markets.\n\nMORE DETAILS:\nA core inflation index, which strips out the impact from volatile items including food and energy, rose more than forecast in July to an annual 61.7%, up from 57% in the previous month\nProducer prices, an early indicator of inflation, continued to grow by more than 100% for the sixth straight month.  Factory inflation reached an annual 145% last month\nAnnual price gains in food accelerated to 94.7%, from 93.9% in June; the cost of transportation rose an annual 119.1%\nThe worst of the crisis is probably still ahead. \n\nPrice growth is set to peak around 85% in September-October, according to a forecast range chart accompanying the central bank‚Äôs latest inflation report. The bank‚Äôs projection now shows inflation will end the year at 60.4%, an upward revision of almost 18 percentage points that puts prices 12 times above the target.\n\nThat outlook is still upbeat relative to the views in the market. Bloomberg Economics predicts inflation will reach a high of 91% in the third quarter and only slow to 69% at the end of 2022.\n\n‚ÄúIf this monetary policy continues, it will be impossible to get ahead of inflation,‚Äù said Ogeday Topcular, a money manager at RAM Capital SA in Geneva. ‚ÄúTurkey‚Äôs monetary policy is unsustainable.‚Äù\n\nRuling out the option of tightening policy, Kavcioglu said last week that Turkey‚Äôs year-end inflation may be below the central bank‚Äôs forecast, with a slowdown possible already this month. \n\nAnd at least in manufacturing, the rate of output price increases is already decelerating, which S&P Global said amounts to ‚Äúfurther signs that the inflationary headwind has peaked.‚Äù\n\nAsked about the divergence from other central banks, Kavcioglu said that only ‚Äútime will tell who was right.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî With assistance by Burhan Yuksekkas, and Harumi Ichikura\n\n(Updates with inflation data for July.)\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-03/turkish-inflation-is-likely-to-exceed-80-and-it-has-yet-to-peak", "id": "wf35s0", "created_utc": 1659522963.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|93|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tt13w5/gas_payment_ruble_putin/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wf35s0)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wf35s0)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I know I'm paying at least 30% more for food in the US, thanks to our 9.1 cpi", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "I am yet to come across anything that has gone up ONLY 9.1% yoy.
