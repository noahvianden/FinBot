Their billionaire hedge-fund hero, who might have known about the unpaid bills, got out in time.\n\n#### By [Wolf Richter](https://wolfstreet.com/author/wolf-richter/) for [WOLF STREET](https://wolfstreet.com/).\n\nThe $675 million of senior unsecured 30-year bonds that meme-stock darling Bed Bath & Beyond issued in 2014, and that are due in 2044, with a coupon interest of 5.165%, collapsed to a new closing low of 15.8 cents on the dollar today, with some trades being below 15 cents, after having plunged all last week from the meme-stock inspired dead-cat bounce.\n\nThat would be a yield to maturity of 33%, assuming that the company pays the interest for the life of the bond and doesn’t default, and at maturity pays off the bond. But with this yield, the bond market is signaling that a default and a bankruptcy filing are imminent, with a massive haircut for unsecured bondholders (chart by [FINRA/Morningstar](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/BondDetail.jsp?ticker=C614517&symbol=BBBY4144682)):\n\n📷\n\nOn Friday, Bloomberg [reported](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/some-bed-bath-beyond-suppliers-halt-shipments-on-unpaid-bills-1.1808001) that a survey of vendors, undertaken by credit-rating and consulting firm Pulse Ratings, had found that Bed Bath & Beyond had fallen behind as much as 90 days on its bills.\n\nAll respondents had past-due accounts receivable with Bed Bath & Beyond, and some said that over half of their accounts receivable with Bed Bath & Beyond were past due. The suppliers also complained that “management is short on guidance about its plans to catch up with its past-due bills,” according to Bloomberg, citing the survey it had seen.\n\nAlso according to Bloomberg, based on its sources, several firms that provide trade credit insurance to vendors have revoked coverage of Bed Bath & Beyond.\n\nNot being able to pay suppliers is getting very close to the endgame. And the bond market knows that a lot better than the meme-stock crowd.\n\nThe $225 million of senior unsecured 20-year notes that Bed Bath & Beyond issued in 2014, due in 2034, with a coupon interest of 4.915%, collapsed to a new low of 16 cents on the dollar today.\n\nThat would be a yield of 34%, assuming that the company even pays the interest for the life of the bond which the bond market assumes is very unlikely (chart by [FINRA/Morningstar](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/BondDetail.jsp?ticker=C614515&symbol=BBBY4144685))\n\n📷\n\nThe $300 million in of senior unsecured 10-year notes that Bed Bath & Beyond issued in 2014, due in 2024, with a coupon interest of 3.749%, collapsed to a new low of 32.7 cents on the dollar today.\n\nThat’s a yield to maturity of 75%, assuming that those bonds will pay interest for two years and then get redeemed at face value in August 2024. But the bond market is nearly certain the company will default before August 2024, and that a bankruptcy court will give them high and tight haircuts (chart by [FINRA/Morningstar](https://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/BondDetail.jsp?ticker=C614513&symbol=BBBY4144687))\n\n📷\n\nThe likely buyers of these bonds are hedge funds and PE firms that want a seat at the table during the bankruptcy proceedings to get their share of the pie while shareholders get ripped apart.\n\nThis plunge in bond prices unwinds the boost that the bonds received from the meme-stock crowd when they inflated the shares to such an extent that it created the hope that the company could raise cash by issuing new shares at those inflated prices. But that didn’t happen.\n\nBut from the prices today, we can see that holders of these unsecured bonds are now figuring into their calculus a very high probability that they will have to fight this out in bankruptcy court.\n\nNumerous other brick and mortar retailers were liquidated in bankruptcy court in recent years, including Toys ‘R’ Us. Sears was chopped to little pieces in bankruptcy court. Money-losing over-indebted brick-and-mortar retailers are notoriously difficult the restructure in bankruptcy court, and most end up getting liquidated.\n\nHolders of unsecured bonds issued by retailers tend to get little or nothing in bankruptcy court. But stockholders are the bottom of the capital structure, lower even than unsecured bond holders and other unsecured creditors, and tend to get wiped out.\n\nAnd yet, bankruptcy filings have fired up the meme-stock crowd into bidding up shares of companies after they filed for bankruptcy, hoping for I dunno, that at a minimum they can sell that stuff to the greater meme-stock fool at 10 times the price?\n\nBut selling that stuff is precisely what the meme-stock crowd doesn’t do, and so they get wiped out when the hedge fund billionaires amid them – who know that you don’t have a profit until you dump this stuff – dump this stuff, and eager falling-knife grabbers in the meme-stock crowd make that a very profitable trade for the hedge fund billionaires.\n\nWhich is what happened in the case of Bed Bath & Beyond when activist investor Ryan Cohen, five months after hyping the shares and disclosing that his firm RC Ventures had taken a 9.8% stake in the company, and then imposing some changes on the company, dumped his entire stake, causing the shares to re-collapse.\n\nSEC filings show that RC Ventures dumped the shares on August 16 and 17 at prices ranging from $18.68 to $29.21, cashing out a profit of $69 million, while the meme-stock traders that hung on to their shares or bought the falling knives got carried out on stretchers.\n\nThe Bloomberg report came out on Friday, and the information that Bed Bath & Beyond was behind on its bills had likely started circulating before then. The bonds started to re-collapse on August 17. There is a good chance that Cohen knew that the company was behind on its bills – that he knew that this was getting close to the endgame and that he needed to get out while the getting was good.\n\nOnly the meme stock traders didn’t know it. These folks need to learn from Cohen that you don’t make money with this crap unless you sell this crap when it’s high.\n\nFrom the intraday high on August 17 of $30 a share until the close today – in four and a half trading days – the share price kathoomphed 69% (data via [YCharts](https://ycharts.com/)):\n\n📷\n\nIn the end, this is the classic story of a brick-and-mortar retailer with lots of big stores that got run over by ecommerce.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond has an ecommerce operation, like Sears and Toys ‘R’ Us had ecommerce operations, and customers are using it. But the stores are expensive to operate, and they require a lot of inventory (cash) and staff, and this has been years in the making.\n\nAnnual revenues collapsed by 36% from the peak in 2017 through 2021, and 2021 was the best year ever for retailers as consumers blew their pandemic gazillions on no matter what — but they stayed away from Bed Bath & Beyond:\n\n📷\n\nWhat’s different is that the meme-stock traders and hedge funds have gotten involved in the brick-and-mortar meltdown – also see GameStop – during the greatest stock bubble ever, and they played this game amongst each other, shuffling those stocks back and forth, hyping the shares in the social media and then dumping them, while others believed their hype and bought the stuff and got cleaned out. Oldest game in town.

{"title": "8-29-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Well if you know me you know my two least favorite types of days to trade are either days we open with a massive gap up or down and trend days… today we got both. \n\nLets break down the fuckery that was today. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owyue00kqpk91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3f3928be4c5de0b6dcac736a05e88761dbabd1b\n\nOvernight we saw futures drop to -1% and higher for most of the night, however, by morning they had given back a lot of that overnight drop. Leaving a nice gap at 405.22 to be filled. From 930am till about 1030am the bulls tried as hard as they could to gap fill and failed everytime. This sent us into a pretty convincing sell off. However, the bulls had other plans in mind and from 11am till really the last candle of the day the bulls were in control. The most impressive thing was despite all the times that SPY looked weak and ready to break down with perfect setups and even volume dumping the bulls managed to rip the candles back bullish. I actually am impressive after Friday massively red day and the massive red futures and red gap down we had that the bulls were able to take control the way they did today. \n\nOnce we gap filled 405.2 continued to be support. It was not until the last candle of the day that we finally saw the actual weakness of the day set it with a nice nearly $2 sell off on the last 15minute candle. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/br7bpuokqpk91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9abc28ec28fcc0db77502675210b1ce4e47d48aa\n\nWe are trading below key resistance levels of 405.2 now. With that resistance we should expect to revisit 390 now. As I mentioned we should expect to be able to play level to level on spy and apple. \n\nKey support for tomorrow is going to remain at 402.1. with the blue bull support being at 399.9. \n\nThere is also a projected red bull channel to keep an eye on with support at 402.1 tomorrow. \n\nInterestingly enough this is giving me Monday/ Tuesday flashbacks from last week. We had a big red day followed by a gravestone doji with slightly lower lows made. \n\nOverall looking at the red bull channel we have possible upside of 424.4 this week and the blue bear channel gives potential downside of 395.4 this week. Of course this blue channels support is only projected so the actual downward channel support could be much lower then where we are currently. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/772e7wdlqpk91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bae8a627f397dac89f4f3a56e433127052977f66\n\nOne interesting thing on the weekly that is forming is this solid black falling wedge. This falling wedge could actually result in a breakout to the upside. For this to play out we would have to hold the 401.2 low of day all week though. If we break that 401.2 level then that falling wedge will get negated. \n\nKey weekly resistance remains at 408.4 and major support down at 390.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5jspzqzlqpk91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=196f441749f25ecec2479b9fa02bb934021ed342\n\nFutures daily looking the same as SPY with Key support of 4023 over night and tomorrow. From there the blue bear channel support is at 3995 with the red bull channel support at 4032.\n\nUpside potential for the red bull channel is 4332 and blue bull channel potential downside is 3956.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/08vi1njmqpk91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e97cc83d51c1cba9007bb7ae1b4417294750a8b\n\nFutures weekly shows the same possible falling wedge with key support being the lod of 4006 to hold the rest of the week. \n\nKey resistance for the weekly is 4112 and key support is 3902.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0s3gg5nqpk91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca1cca36dddec3caef8713f23c0dd134553b378c\n\nApple didn’t really have as dramatic of a day as SPY and they actually didn’t even gap fill completely today. And despite how many times SPY had retest hod apple never actually retested its HOD. \n\nKey support will remain at 159.8 tomorrow and if that breaks we should look for support at 158.2 and eventually gap fill at 157.64.\n\nBlue bear channel support is at 159.2 for tomorrow with the red (this is the 12 week long bull channel) being at 156.8.\n\nThere is actually besides the 12 week bull support line not a smaller bull channel like spy/ es futures has. Therefore upside potential for Apple is 166.8 for blue bull channel resistance and support of 156.8 for downside potential based on the daily trends. \n\nIf we see that 12 week bull support broken that would be a bigger omen for SPY and the markets in general. If we see big tech call that will be extremely bearish for the future. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odcyw4snqpk91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=59854a27bdb0ef1599eb3e1a86b528edd7134224\n\nApple weekly does show that same falling wedge that SPY/ ES weeklies are showing. Key support will be at the 159.8 low for that. A key support to break through is the weekly level of 161.1 from there bears will look for support at 157.5. If 161.1 support holds bulls will look for 163.7 and 166.5.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4cfxlmcoqpk91.png?width=358&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb08147da117d9fcb91b63e7f25cc13df48b9168\n\nI am actually long on some this Friday and next Friday DTE apple (were ATM) puts. There are a little red right now but with the trend continuing to show weakness by Friday I do plan for these to be fairly green. My target sell for the 4dte is 157.5 and for the 11dte is 154.3.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkiom2uoqpk91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc7e08e997756eef31c295b59553772f5ffa2612\n\nThe VIX had an interesting day today. We had a really massive gap up that was followed by the gap filling and support at 25.5 being retested. That support held perfectly and resulted in a really big bounce up for VIX EOD and a close over 26. We are not trending back in the 25.5 to 34.7 channel that we have spent the majority of 2022 in. this is another bearish omen for the markets. As long as VIX is over 25.5 I do suspect we see downside. We lose 25.5 that will be a reason for the markets to turn around. \n\nSo on Friday I mentioned while I wanted to be bearish I was skeptical. Like I had mentioned the markets need a reason to sell. And today they didn’t have a reason to sell. Almost all day we saw “buy the dip” playing out. It was clear who was in control today. However, EOD there we did see the bears take control with that $2 sell off. With the gap being filled and a rejection of key 405.2 level there could be a reason for the markets to sell off and there could be a reason markets do not want to hold anymore. The media is shifting to a really bearish narrative we haven’t seen since really February or march. This is going to be an interesting week and as long as SPY is below 405.2 resistance I favor a test of 390 support. \n\n10% challenge-\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7y4uxzfpqpk91.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ee3749eeab0a2f9eb3b053e536cee9d4a7a4114\n\nStraight up bad day for me. Made a great trade in the morning. Got a bad bounce on a fake break down for the -13.2% loss. \n\nI trusted that a range day was building with 404 becoming resistance. I entered a put on that 1230 candle that massively broke down and regrettably broke my rules and entered with a SL. I saw how choppy markets were and “didn’t wanna get stopped out before I would get rewarded” because I was convinced we would see a massive sell off and close under 402.2 support. \n\nWell I was wrong obviously as they gap filled us and then every convincing sell off candle was just ripped back green and when we finally did sell off as I was expecting it was too late. Bad day and bad way to start the week off. No one to blame but myself. \n\nImportant thing for me here is to not over trade and to not break any more of my rules… when you take a tough loss you have to fight back organically. Don’t over trade and definitely don’t revenge trade trying to get back.\n\nYoutube will be up later.", "id": "x0z3h2", "created_utc": 1661805259.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments":
