Because I don’t have a ton of capital, I’m only wanting to spend $30-$50 a week. This disqualifies me from straight up buying long dated puts. What I’ve been doing is opening a debit spreads by buying around the 300 strike and selling the next cheapest strike. My expiration is 1/20/23.\n\nAny advice would be appreciated.

Barrett had a history of speeding, having been ticketed just two months before the deadly crash for traveling at 112 mph. The jury placed 9% of the blame on James Riley himself. \n\nThe jury awarded $10.5 million in damages.\n\n“We are pleased that, in what we understand to be the first case to go to trial against Tesla involving an accident involving one of their vehicles, the jury found Tesla to have been negligent in removing the speed limiter without letting Mr. or Mrs. Riley know,” an attorney for the Rileys said in a statement.\n\nAnother family recently hired a prominent Florida personal injury firm following a crash of a 2015 Tesla Model S earlier this month that killed two people.", "id": "w39hz4", "created_utc": 1658280698.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|160|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w39hz4)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w39hz4)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Notice the article doesn’t say the portion of fault attributed to Tesla.
