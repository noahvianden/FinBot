I think a couple of chapters from that book could answer the majority of your questions.\n\nA big emphasis of the book is that two types a value inherently exist for a stock - the market value (what you see quoted every day) and intrinsic value (what the stock is actually worth). It‚Äôs not uncommon that these two values will differ from time to time. \n\nA great analogy from the book is that of Mr. Market. He is an erratic and irrational salesman, who knocks at your door everyday and offers you wildly different prices on the same stock. It‚Äôs your job as a smart investor to determine the intrinsic value of a stock and consider buying when Mr. Market offers you a good deal. Sometimes he will offer you terrible deals, asking for way more than what the stock is worth (but you are never obligated to buy). So yes, the market can be irrational but deals exist and intelligent investors will be on the lookout for them.\n\nTo your other point, stocks still have inherent value even if you don‚Äôt directly receive the profits. Business valuation is complex but most people choose to discount the future earning of a business to todays dollars to arrive at an intrinsic value. Therefore, the more a business is expected to grow and make money, the higher it‚Äôs valuation will be. Even if you never receive the earnings, picking good businesses to invest in will make them more valuable in the future and allow you to sell the stock for more than your cost basis. But as I said earlier, sometimes the market isn‚Äôt always rational. Market quotes do not always reflect true value and it may be discouraging to see your stocks decline.

That was down slightly from its loss of $2.96 billion in the first quarter and better than analyst estimates for a loss of $3.67 billion for the division for the quarter, according to FactSet.\n\n* FRL generated revenue of $452 million in the second quarter, down from revenues of $695 million in the first quarter. That was a small fraction of the $28.4 billion generated in the quarter from Meta‚Äôs family of apps, which include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n* The company said it expected Reality Labs revenue to be lower in the third quarter compared to Q2.\n* Meta announced in last year‚Äôs fourth quarter that it would be breaking out results for the division to show the performance and investments in a group that it considers key to the next generation of online social experiences.\n* For 2021, Meta reported a loss of $10.2 billion on revenue of $2.3 billion for FRL. The company has said it is committed to spending even more on the division for the next several years.\n* On the company‚Äôs Q1 earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company's metaverse arm is currently \"laying the groundwork for a very successful 2030s.\"\n* Overall, Meta‚Äôs adjusted quarterly earnings per share of $2.46 missed analysts' average estimate of $2.54, according to FactSet, while its overall revenue of $28.8 billion fell just short of estimates of $28.9 billion.\n* Meta's shares fell close to 4% to $163.25 in after-hours trading on Wednesday on the results.
