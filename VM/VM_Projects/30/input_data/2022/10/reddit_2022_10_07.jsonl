{"title": "Credit Suisse is too big to fail. Buy calls 🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "Alright fellow regards, I have some unfortunate news for you guys\n\nCredit Suisse probably isn't going to go out of business. Yes, their financials are a flaming sack of dog shit wrapped in cat shit, topped with a garnish of rat shit. But governments have a pesky preference for not letting big banks fail, especially since the banking industry is an incestuous circle of greed\n\nI opened 100 contracts of Credit Suisse $3 Dec16 Puts on Monday and they're only down about 10%, but since then $CS has pumped from $4.00 to $4.80, a 20% weekly gain. What the fuck, you may be asking yourself? Credit Suisse's credit default swaps pumped 300% this week, meaning investors think Credit Suisse is 300% more likely to default. Who is buying shares in this shitty European bank on its deathbed? \n\nThe Federal Reserve. In 1988 Ronny Reagan founded the Working Group on Financial Markets, more commonly known as the Plunge Protection Team (PPT). The PPT dumps liquidity into the markets to prop things up before a crash can start. Banks have been sharing risk with other banks more than ever before, essentially ensuring if one bank dies, they won't be the only fuckhead on Wall St going to hell\n\nCredit Suisse is too big to fail. The government will not allow them to go bankrupt. On the off chance central bankers decided to embrace the free market and let a shit bank go under, another bank would happily acquire Credit Suisse for $4/share\n\nIn conclusion, I think $4 was the bottom for Credit Suisse. I'm currently considering liquidating half of my puts on $CS and converting them to ATM and slightly OTM calls\n\n[Positions](https://imgur.com/a/l7rpzCG)", "id": "xy5w4v", "created_utc": 1665165831.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|21|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|204|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xy5w4v/credit_suisse_is_too_big_to_fail_buy_calls/) \n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xy5w4v)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xy5w4v)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "However, I'm a fucking idiot so I'm going to ignore my own advice for now and ride these puts to Valhalla\n\nGod I hate myself", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "God speed brother!
