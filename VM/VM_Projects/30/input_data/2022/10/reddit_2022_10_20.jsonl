{"title": "Autonation - Fun Run is Dun", "selftext": "This is my first write up.  I don't know shit, and I am putting about an hour worth of effort into this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think, based on my very limited knowledge of finance, that AutoNation's revenues have been experiencing the benefit of Covid Stimulus and PPP loans, and the party is about to end.\n\nYou can read from a seking alpa article that AutoNation benefited extremely from the supply chain shortages, jacking up prices and taking advantage of a society with tons of free government cash.  The article was overall bullish, but at the end the mention this: \"The only metric we see concerning when looking at it on a forward-looking basis is their price to cash flow ratio. Their TTM price to cash flow ratio of 4.15 is significantly lower than their FWD ratio of 6.22. This indicates that in the future, AutoNation's cash flows may decline; We would expect this to happen if there was a recession. When things return to normal and car prices go back down, AutoNation will not be able to bring in as much cash as they are now.\"\n\nWith this article written after a hot July report, the sentiment may be much different now that car prices have plateaued and will plummet with new buyers not being able to finance at the high rates and high prices. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z715o4f3mvu91.png?width=1070&format=png&auto=webp&s=25d3203611f622312609211d3ec4716e6560c395\n\nCurrent used car prices are down 10% YoY, the largest decline since 2009.\n\nYou can see here that their net income has benefitted in an exponential way from the increased demand of 2020/2021.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/skhfesf6mvu91.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=61c10c8b1bea503c59a0a1215ca60ed2e2829d4e\n\nUnsustainable growth if you ask me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wmc6uj17mvu91.png?width=2408&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef0ade892c50d0893f94818893b4adaa777c2d31\n\nYou can see how their unit sales actually decreased  significantly YoY, and yet their revenue up 6% due to high prices, which won't last.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a77vcsu7mvu91.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&s=74bd8b1fc7e5d8c6b72bb9d4b0b2dca35ceede57\n\nInsiders have been selling, which is a sign of a potential peak in the stock price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, and maybe most importantly (especially if you are a GME nut), who has been the one doing the selling?

In comparison, Tesla's market cap is about $690 billion. This means Tesla would have to grow roughly six times its current size to catch up.\n\n\"I see a potential path for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined,\" said Musk, according to a transcript of Tesla's earnings call on October 19. He acknowledged it'll be tough, but it can be achieved with \"a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion and always the luck.\"\n\nMusk made the ambitious statement on Wednesday after Tesla reported record revenues of $21.45 billion in the third quarter of 2022 — although it fell short of the $21.96 billion analysts were estimating, per IBES data from Refinitiv. The company also posted a profit of $3.29 billion in the quarter running from July to September — just under a record profit of $3.3 billion reported in the first quarter of this year.\n\nFull article: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/elon-musk-tesla-surpass-combined-apple-aramco-value-earnings-profits-2022-10](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/elon-musk-tesla-surpass-combined-apple-aramco-value-earnings-profits-2022-10)\n\nElon Musk says Tesla (TSLA) can exceed the combined value of Apple (AAPL) and Saudi Aramco, which currently with combined market cap of around $4.4 trillion.

With the loss of 3680 I suspect a retest of that key 3590 support area. \n\nKey support- 3590 -> 3500\n\nKey resistance- 3710 -> 3760 -> 3805\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oq4eu59or0v91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc6853b2599531bfdccea7354cb6f0f9f7e27de0\n\nI am bearish on apple, however, I would like to see it lose and close under its daily 8ema, however it did hard reject the daily 20ema today again. Apple put in a really massive gravestone doji today just like Spy did. This candle should be a reversal candle and should lead to a downside test. I do expect a test of at least 138.2 by end of next week. \n\nKey support -141.7 -> 138.2\n\nKey resistance- 143.9 -> 146.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7qzqicuor0v91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=09ca3d7f43e99b58e7a0ea15f65179026b8d9277\n\nTesla has been on an absolute wild sell off for the last month with no end in sight. We found support at that 205 range today bouncing off of it twice today. I was actually a little impressed to see Tesla bounce how it did this morning as I really thought we might just breach through 200 today. However it looks like after putting a new 52 week low in today that we will have to wait and see where it goes.

It doesn’t quite want to sell off, however it doesn’t quite want to rip up either. Today we saw spy close almost -1% and yet the VIX actually unwound slightly. \n\nI am still holding bearish until that key 28.4 level is broken. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a great day for me.
