{"title": "Keep Calm and Carry On: A level view of 2022", "selftext": "Mass human psychology will always lag reality. \n\nConsider the below bullets points and the TL/DR at the bottom. **2022 is going to turn out just fine.** \n\n* **Rate hikes will be slow and steady**\n   * Inflation is not out of control: the Biden admin is (admittedly) right that supply side shocks are heavily influencing key elements of the CPI basket. There is ZERO reason for the Fed to panic and drop a .5 bomb on everyone on Monday, or even in the near future. This is an extremely delicate process, and the Fed is going to continue to combine (1) hawkish language with (2) slow and steady rate hikes. I will borrow a phrase from Deng Xiaoping here and say that in 2022, the Fed is going to 'cross a river feeling for stones'. \n   * A slowly increasing rate hike environment is not destiny. Everyone here needs to move beyond the extraordinarily simple money printer paradigm. YES, QE absolutely contributed to high valuations, but NO, a slowly paced rate hike in combination with an easing in COVID/Supply Side issues (see below) is not the recipe for a crash. Are some companies going to be naked when the water slowly recedes? Yes--but corporate profitability is very high right now. If AMC and other bullshit fake companies go out of business, the huge employment needs in EVERY sector (not just Wendys) will catch those workers. \n   * Everyone with an IQ above 80 has known that COVID QE was going to cause inflation, and require rate hikes. Retail capitulations over the past \n* **COVID is fading away and becoming seasonal like the Flu**\n   * Look at the numbers, they are there for everyone to see. Already the Biden admin is talking about rolling mask mandates back. Sure, another variant could pop up, but we are on the brink of Summer and COVID is now becoming a seasonal phenomenon. \n   * Therefore, people will start to go back to normal. This is beneficial for consumption, as well as for easing supply-shocks (particularly in China). \n* **Supply Side issues are already easing and will continue to ease as COVID concerns globally start to lessen**\n* **Ukraine is not going to become the global crisis many here think it will**\n   * Read the room: major players in Europe and the U.S. are NOT going to throw down over Ukraine. Literally, Berlin runs Europe, and Berlin sent helmets to Ukraine. If that doesn't tell you the degree of European resolve, I don't know what else will. \n   * If a conflict occurs, it is more likely limited (Think: Crimea lite) for Putin to save face. This means that limited war is possible without massive contagion. Far Western Ukraine (Donbass) already has political, culture, and linguistic splits with Kyiv, and in material terms, the only major consequence is that a larger % of the European grain supply will be Russian-owned. Now the French will have to start buying American grain for their pastries. \n* **Incomes are pacing with inflation**\n   * I saw an advertisement at Chipotle for $15 an hour this week. I'm a big four bro on the services side, and I got a 10% raise this year. Salaries are up across the board: in Consulting, new hires are making WAY more than they did two years ago. McDonalds literally just came out and said at all company owned restaurants, its $13 an hour average, and will be $15 by 2024. \n   * Yes, I know you can find articles like this ([NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/10/business/dealbook/inflation-pay-prices.html)) that says that prices are outpacing inflation, but we are in a SUPPLY SIDE crisis. This is NOT a demand side crisis. Logistics bottlenecks and COVID easing are critical to this going away. \n* **Corporate profits are at all time highs**\n* **Biden is afraid of 2022 midterms and will not rock the boat with China this year.** \n   * Yes, shaking a sword at China is politically popular, but Biden is *very* unpopular right now and the DNC does NOT want to worsen the bloodletting its destined to suffer late this year by aggravating an already bad supply chain crisis. \n   * The new tariff options the Admin is exploring are punitive measures. It is a continuation of the low level friction that will define U.S.-Sino relations for the next decade. \n\n# TLDR\n\nMass human psychology will always lag reality. **There are very, very good reasons to think that the bottom is in, and 2022 is going to be smooth and steady**.", "id": "sqtjit", "created_utc": 1644678542.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|226|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sqtjit)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sqtjit)\n    \nHey /u/IS_JOKE_COMRADE2, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Making a lot of big assumptions here and simplifying problems drastically. \n\nAdditionally, you make the dangerous assumption that everyone at every level will behave rationally using the same arguments you use.

QT is going to deleverage the system, which is badly needed. If QE continues, yes, valuations will be maintained high at first, but markets will become more and more dysfunctional, with high volatility, as we have seen lately, because companies will need to ramp up earnings to justify these high valuations, meaning they will have to increase prices, causing inflation at the consumer end, or they will have to grow at impossible rates. If they are not able to do it, they will sink in value. Not to mention high real state prices caused by QE will push rent up, increasing inflation in the long run as well. Housing is like 30% of CPI... The argument that the problem with inflation is only on the supply side assumes that demand is not part of the equation.

{"title": "Bear Market vs Bear Trap: how Russia plays into it?", "selftext": "Everyone wants to time the market, but it has been shown over and over again that DCA‚Äôing is a much better approach. As long as you are DCA‚Äôing into stocks / projects that can survive a true bear market, then it really doesn‚Äôt matter if the sell off over the last 48hrs is the continuation of a bear market or just a bull trap fabricated by nonstop Russia / Ukraine fear mongering.\n\nPutting aside that point, I really don‚Äôt think Putin am has any interest in going to war with US/NATO. \n\nI am purely speculating, but here is a stance that can explain Putin's actions‚Ä¶and one that would turn him for someone who is bat shit crazy into someone who is playing 4D chess. \n\n1. He knows our financial system is already unstable. Inflation, stimulus no more, the fed has stopped printing, rates are going to be increased, and asset prices are at record high valuations and primed for a correction. All of this is causing uncertainty and many are starting to believe the markets are standing on the edge of cliff. \n\n2. Additionally, Ukraine's pro west leader, Zelenski, is relying on the west for stimulus and general stability. If the west cannot provide the aid or if it falls into a recession, Zelenski loses support from his base and Putin is given a narrative that says, 'the west is dealing with their own problems, their is no way they can help Ukraine'.\n\n3. So Putin fabricates the threat of war in an attempt to push the US markets over the edge. That creates opportunity for Putin and an opportunity for Russian backed, Ukrainian politicians to gain back popular support. \n\nNow, the risk in him playing this game is steep. Because if he pushed the west too far, and they impose sanctions, it will crater Russia‚Äôs economy. So if this is his strategy he is walking a very thin, but manageable line. I say this because all he has to do is to continue to posture and cause uncertainty right up until the point where the US is about to put sanctions in place‚Ä¶and then back down. In that time, the markets will either fall off the cliff or not, but they will certainly be weakened per how they have responded over the last 48hrs. \n\nWould be interested in others thoughts on all this as week. \n\nNot financial advise.
