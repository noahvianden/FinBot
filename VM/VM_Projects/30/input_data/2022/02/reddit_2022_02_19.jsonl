The misuse of fundamental terms is very worrying for someone playing with options.\n\nSecond, this is not a \"Robinhood\" specific phenomenon, as everyone is quick to jump to. Any time someone is trading on margin, they have to first agree to the broker's right to liquidate your positions. ALL brokers do this. They may have different risk management algorithms, but their right to liquidate without warning is there.\n\nFinally, to your question. Your position was liquidated because you likely lacked the buying power to take assignment. And before you say \"but vertical spreads have limited loss\" - it doesn't matter when you're that close to expiry. Yes, margin requirement is only width of the spread when far from expiry, but when you're close like this and you open yourself to pin risk, that no longer applies.\n\nLet's say TSLA ended 824. Your long put expires worthless. You get assigned on your short. Maybe you're looking at a loss of only $100 minus premium received - maybe you even have a small win, but you need $82,500 in capital to take assignment, then hold the position until Tuesday and pray TSLA didn't move up or down to realize that. If you don't have that capital, the broker is unwilling to lend you that amount of money, so they liquidate your position before it even gets close.\n\nTake this further - let's say TSLA ended the day at 824 but it dropped over the weekend to 810. Your 815 long put expires worthless, so is unable to protect you. You may end up losing more than $1000 in your spread.\n\nAlways close your position if you're unwilling or unable to take assignment.
