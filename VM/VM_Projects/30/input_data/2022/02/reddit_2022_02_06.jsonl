{"title": "What small cap stocks are going to the moon?", "selftext": "We all know MAGAT is the new FAANG but mega cap tech giants aside, what about the small caps? Will they rally?

I want to see what majority believes because that should give everyone a good indication of what’s popular over the next couple of years. This is not financial advice and due to inflation and lack of competence in the monetary system there’s no promise of stocks increasing at all over the next year. I’m bullish but there are people who believe we are on the verge of a recession. Invest wisely and at your own risk. \n\nI believe we have a bit of pain left and I know we have lots of inflation to come. I just don’t know how the market will react during this “deflation” period. \n\nMy picks are: Lemonade, Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Cloudflare and PDC Energy\n\nEdit: I chose lemonade because I believe one of the biggest things the next decade has to offer is artificial intelligence and tech insurance. I chose rocket because I stand behind the Gene research they do in rare pediatric disorders and I chose PDC energy due to the expected increase in the value of oil in 2022.", "id": "sm6pwj", "created_utc": 1644179520.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.36, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "ASTR", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Why?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Partnered with NASA already even though it's a young company.

Six to twelve months from now when that first facility is completed and successfully operational. That will be another leg up. They own a majority of Simpson Maxwell, so a lot of the engineering and manufacturing will be done in house. When orders start coming in and the earnings are public, hopefully I’ll start planning my retirement.\n \n  They also picked up a renewable diesel facility, they own and operate some oil and gas leases. So that will be a steady income for them. \n\n  Also they will be manufacturing ozone sanitation systems. Their main focus in that area is for biohazard medical waste disposal. \n\n  So they are a diverse company with fantastic and achievable goals. Providing those goals are achieved.
