{"title": "Treat trading like a business", "selftext": "# Overview\n\nIn this post, I will talk about:\n\n\\- Understanding your industry\n\n\\- Provide the right service\n\n\\- Find the right market\n\n# Intro\n\nTrading is hard. There are many good traders, but also many traders that are losing money. One common theme I see is that losing traders don't see trading as a business. In this post, I try to provide some insight into how traders should think about the job.\n\n# Understanding your industry\n\nThere are a lot of different market participants. People wouldn't start a business without understanding the different players in the space - and trading is no different\n\n**Market Makers**\n\nMarket makers quote prices (and quantities) at which they're willing to buy and sell assets. Because their profit comes from the bid/ask spread, they have to be extremely careful in managing their inventory.\n\nMarket Makers provide a service by offering liquidity to whoever needs to trade in the market; they allow traders to make trades immediately in exchange for the bid/ask spread.\n\nAs retail traders, it's more likely than not that market makers are our 'suppliers'; we trade with them more than we trade with other retail.\n\nAs retail traders, it's more likely than not that market makers are our 'suppliers'; we trade with them directly more than we trade with anyone else. We should try to minimize our 'costs' by making good use of limit orders; hitting the bid or ask too often cuts into our long term profits.\n\n**Investors**\n\nInvestors include pension funds, mutual funds, and other money managers. Like individual investors, they are compensated for providing equity capital - stocks are much cheaper than their future earnings because of the uncertainty of those earnings.\n\nInstitutional investors might sell covered calls (since they're okay with missing out on some gains if it means earning some premium during flat/down markets), or they may buy puts as insurance. Some funds use options as a way to replace stock positions in order to make leveraged, directional (delta) bets.\n\nSince trading options is not their primary business, whether an option has an IV of 15 or 16 doesn't matter all that much to them. This provides a lot of trading opportunities for others.\n\nMarket Makers try to set prices to manage their inventory. However, sometimes there's just more investor demand for one product than there is supply. This means that the Market Maker has to adjust their prices away from \"fair value\" in order to balance their order flow.\n\nThese investors who push prices around give us trading opportunities. These are our customers.\n\n**Hedge Funds / Prop Traders**\n\nHedge Funds and Prop Traders try to meet excess investor demand by selling overpriced assets, and then hedging by buying similar (but not the same) assets. They then realize a profit when demand subsides and the asset prices return to normal. Prop Traders make the markets more efficient, which makes finding good trades harder - these are our competitors.\n\nIt's worth noting that there's a lot of overlap between market makers and prop traders. Many prop shops run market-making strategies.\n\n# Provide The Right Service\n\nThere are a lot of different players in the market. What does this mean?\n\nThe competition is intense. You usually can't sell super overpriced stuff or buy stuff at a great value. Looking at CPI numbers or economic data is probably not going to generate alpha because every investment fund also has that. Similarly, everyone can see RSI or MACD indicators. It's highly unlikely some DD from public information will help you find a stock undervalued by 50% - institutional investors with better/faster information would have bought up the stock, pushing up prices to fair value.\n\n***TL;DR: Public info is priced in.***\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean that there's no opportunity to make money. Market Makers, Investors, and Hedge Funds all make money - because they all provide some sort of service to the market.\n\nMarket Making is too difficult for most retail investors, but what we can do is be paid a risk premium.\n\nInvestors get paid an equity risk premium. They provide a company with equity capital, and in exchange, the investors are entitled to a share of future earnings. Stocks are valued based on *Discounted Cash Flow* \\- basically, stock prices are equal to future earnings, but discounted to ensure investors get a nice return.\n\n**Volatility Risk Premium**\n\nWe can also get paid a Volatility Risk Premium. A lot of institutional investors buy S&P options to hedge. Even market makers want to be net long options because they can't afford to be taking losses during market crises; that's when spreads are widest and volume is highest - the most profitable times for a market maker. As a result, S&P options tend to be overpriced. A simple, systematic trade would be [selling OTM S&P500 put options](https://thehedgefundjournal.com/harvesting-the-s-p500-volatility-risk-premium/). Pretty boring, but so is manufacturing + selling computers or exercise bikes.\n\nOptions on commodities, bonds, and the VIX also tend to be overpriced.\n\nEuan Sinclair's *Positional Options Trading* goes over the volatility risk premium. I highly recommend reading that book.\n\n**Basis Risk**\n\nAnother risk we can be compensated for is basis risk. Most options traders don't trade vol; they're trying to hedge or make delta bets. As a result, the IV of options can get out of whack sometimes. We can sell options that are in high demand and buy options that are less sought after as a hedge. However, we carry *basis risk* because our hedges will not be perfect.\n\nFor example:\n\nSay for some reason everyone wants to buy options on AAPL, pushing the IV of options up considerably.\n\nWe know that MSFT is quite similar to AAPL, so we could sell overpriced AAPL options and buy MSFT options as a hedge.\n\nOther investors could probably buy MSFT options instead of the overpriced AAPL options, but they don't want that *basis risk:* they don't want to miss out on the few times AAPL moves and MSFT doesn't.\n\nThese investors are our customers.\n\nThis is the basic idea behind relative value trading. It gets really complicated, but those trades are where the alpha is, to be honest. And it feels amazing when you find a home-run trade to bet your entire account on.\n\n**Here are some examples of relative value trades:**\n\n\\- [Selling overpriced ETF options, and hedging with the stocks' options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/rm9kgk/ultimate_guide_to_selling_options_profitably_part/); courtesy of [u/AlphaGiveth](https://www.reddit.com/u/AlphaGiveth/)\n\n\\- [Selling overpriced OTM puts, and hedging with ATM options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/8f423y/walkthrough_of_a_tradestrategy_i_did_last_week/)\n\n# Find the Right Market\n\nLike businesses, there are many different markets in which you can operate. Most traders here probably trade US Equity options - the underlying assets are stocks we typically hear most about.\n\nThe US markets are probably the most efficient in the world - this is because most traders play here. There is a lot of competition. Outside of the volatility risk premium, it's harder to find good trade opportunities in indices and large-cap stocks. Trying to find alpha trading the S&P 500 is like trying to win a math competition in China.\n\nHowever, there are opportunities that are too small for the citadels of the world - some trades are too small to be worth their time. Smaller traders like us can play in lower volume, smaller stocks and ETFs that aren't being constantly monitored by hedge funds and prop shops. In fact, some of my best trades were in somewhat illiquid ETFs.\n\nOptions are also available on commodities, currencies, and bonds. There are both ETF options and Futures options for those asset classes, although liquidity might not be as good for the ETFs.\n\nDiversification across asset classes is preferable because the Equity market acts as one big index during a downturn. Having many small trades in many different stocks doesn't really do much good in a market crash, since everything falls at once.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe key takeaways of this post should be:\n\n\\- Understand who your 'customers' are\n\n\\- Understand why your trades should make money; why would your customers pay you?\n\n\\- Trade stuff where there is less competition\n\nIf you liked my post, you'll love Predicting Alpha - they taught me everything I know :)\n\n[Check them out here](https://www.predictingalpha.com/archegos-exclusive)", "id": "urrkep", "created_utc": 1652808429.0, "score": 325, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "Nice one.

I disagree. Most businesses fail within the first five years and very few make it beyond ten years so that 50th anniversary in your locale is closer to a miracle than an eventuality. It turns out that the failure rate in finance is about the same and thus it is imperative that you understand that the *first thing you need to do* is decide if you actually want to start a business.\n\nI am going to tell you now that if you really did want to start a business trading you wouldn't need this \"guide\" since it's not only shorthand but filled with all sorts of inaccuracies. Let's just look at the section of the players alone for instance:\n\n\"Investors don't care about small details. They're your customers.\" This is horrifically incorrect; these individuals get access to deals you do not, do not buy at the market prices you see, have people they pay hundreds of thousands of dollars a year *just* to look at the details and you'd be a plankton in the sea swimming with blue whales thinking they won't eat you. They will. Believe it or not it is precisely because they play the long game that they do have short-term, mid-term and long-term trading strategies always in place involving every security and derivative you can imagine and many you cannot.\n\nThink of them like yourself in your own personal finance; you have savings for the future, current expenses you pay with cash and investments that churn over with mid-range plans such as degrees, certificates and other self-building projects. Would you say that if someone laid down several thousand dollars in front of you that you wouldn't pick it up? Keep in mind that the institutions that these funds are funding don't have the same cost basis and deals as you *but* are buying the same products as you so they pay less for the stuff to get in but they pay the round trip that you do for a tomato. Everyone's goal is to pay as little as possible on the front end because the backend prices are relatively unbendable.\n\n\"Hedge funds are your competition.\" Hedge funds are like sharks. They don't eat plankton. In no uncertain terms should you ever come to the conclusion that hedge funds care that you exist; they do not not in any sense of the word. A proper hedge fund is set up to do one thing which is to provide returns that are market risk divorced. As a plankton in the sea the only thing you can do with your capital is involve yourself in market risk based strategies in order to make money meanwhile the entire goal for them is to do the direct opposite. The whole premise of feeding on you and modeling a way to pick you off is hookum. Wall Street makes money on people not because it's some massive zero sum game but because people literally give away their money trying to fight the boogieman.\n\nKeep in mind that to sign up to be a customer of a hedge fund you need to be a sophisticated investor meanwhile to sign up to be a customer in a mutual fund you just have to have $1 and be 18 years old. This should indicate to you that the people who benefit most from your failures are (big reveal!) large institutions. The whole Gamestop thing for instance benefitted Fidelity a huge amount, ridiculously, and far more than perhaps whatever hedge fund you've been thinking about because Fidelity and a lot of other companies simply have so much capital to deploy that their long game is your lifetime. They can, and do, hold positions for decades at a time even if they aren't doing anything for years and years. They have staying power that you can't imagine.\n\nThe portion about Market Makers is also slightly inaccurate. They're just wholesalers and middlemen. While you are likely trading with a market maker, that is true, the depiction of them as your supplier is not a good one because they don't just take your orders blindly; if there is no other counterparty they won't take your orders.\n\nNow I am not saying that this is bad information in the sense that it's nice to get you pumped up but you may genuinely want to reconsider if this is a job to you or just a hobby. If it is just a hobby *treat it as a hobby* because to treat something as a business means you have to dump certain rules that people tend to live by. \"Never put up more than you can afford to lose\" is one; if this is your livelihood and you're serious about trading you have already bet the house much like if you were serious about going in on a business full-time. You can have a smooth transition, certainly, but if it's just a hobby for you on the side and you maybe you pay for your vacations by putting up 10k and earning a return of 20% every year don't mistake yourself as a person who sits for 8 hours a day with the tools and focus who does the work.\n\nTL;DR: You're not a CFA. Don't trick yourself into thinking you're a CFA. You don't know the industry, you clearly have it backwards if you bought into this, and I highly recommend you seek to understand at least through a very simple and actionable program rather than studying all on your own.

When you're learning to swim you don't go into the deep end first. The *less* liquidity you have the greater the odds you will get stuck in a position you cannot get out of. If you are just starting you should start with:\n\n1. As much time as possible whether buying or selling so that you can see what can happen while also allowing natural volatility to save you when things go south.\n2. As much liquidity as possible whether buying or selling so that you can see what can happen while also allowing natural volume to save you when things go south.\n3. As close to the money as buying and out from the money if selling so that you can see what can happen when the natural volatility goes both in your favor and against you over time and see the value of time diversification in options.\n\nYour advice is to violate one of these especially since if you're a beginner (or even intermediate) what exactly is \"less liquid\"? It's not exactly commonplace to measure liquidity in the sense that one can simply take an optionable security, which has to have a certain basis of liquidity to begin with to even qualify, and then assess over time the most clever way to get through the muck. A beginner is much better off with an AAPL leap making 12% than some obscure XYZ with the \"potential\" of 50% or more.\n\nAnd that is counterintuitive advice anyway because your entire tool kit is going to contain limit orders which is what you're willing to pay regardless and thus has no particular sufferings under high liquidity. That's basically putting bait for one fish on your rod and differentiating between the largest lake where the odds are higher of catching the one you want and the smallest where there are just out-and-out fewer fish. It's no wiser if you control the fish.\n\nAs for PredictingAlpha, you're right, you don't sell articles, you just sell signals and \"analytics\". My error.
