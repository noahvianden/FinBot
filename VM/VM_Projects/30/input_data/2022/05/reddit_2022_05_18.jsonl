We’re working in all the areas we shared on battery day and we have consistent progress across all of those areas towards achieving the five year cost trajectory goals for the costs within our control, but we do not control all of the commodity costs, so that’s an exception I need to call out. Similar to Model 3, it will take us several years to get rate and yields to the point where everything that we’ve discussed is achieved. Our priority was on simplicity and scale during our initial 4680 and structural battery ramps and as we attain our manufacturing goals, we will layer in new material technologies we are developing and higher range structural pack revisions.  \n>  \n>Elon Musk: (23:02)  \n>  \n>I think maybe in a nutshell, I think it probably is fair to say that 4680 and structural pack will be competitive with the best alternatives later this year and we think will exceed the best alternatives next year.  \n>  \n>Drew: (23:23)  \n>  \n>Yeah. I mean we have some good existing proofs. We’ve built the facility here in Texas, we know how much we spent on capital equipment in the facility, and it’s more than 5x less than prior technology installation, so we’re saving huge on CapEx. On utilities and personnel, we know what those loads are and how many people are needed to run what is basically a highly automized factory, and we have massive reductions in both of those.

My opinion is that it is due to a broader market sell off due to fear and weak hands.

Although it did not meet analyst expectations, we should have know inflation was going to hurt everyones earnings. I have a forward looking opinion at the bottom of this post. So read to the end. \n\nBVPS- the BVPS is growing from a QoQ rate and YoY. Their Cash Reserves per share are also in line with the growth. Stability is there and it seems very healthy.\n\nPE- the PE seems inflated compared to its peers, but I believe this is an easy thing to look past given it's balance sheet.\n\nNews- Contrary to the news, WMT did fine on earnings. With inflation hitting the price of goods, I believe Walmart will reap the rewards as a slightly cheaper vendor than Target. Dollar General is also doing well because of the price increases even after adjusting their prices higher. Walmart has always been one of the green companies in a red market. And a safe have for investors in hard times.\n\nWalmart is definitely oversold in my opinion. We may not be at bottom yet. But I will definitely buy this in the coming weeks.

IMO the only way through the inevitable supply crisis is some sort of gas stimulus, at the moment the average American consumes 500 gallons of gas a year and [average price has gone up from 3.27](https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/your-money/gas-costs-hundreds-more-for-average-american/) to [4.56](https://gasprices.aaa.com/) in 6 months. Average salary is 50k, so that is 1.3% of people's money, at some point people will start demanding wages to go up which is going to make wage/price spiral worse. In a way, it's going to make sense to subsidize gas to stop energy from contributing to wage/price spiral. But even if it didn't make sense, it's an election year and politicians are going to want an excuse to give shit away\n\nAnd I mean we're already seeing [different forms of gas stimulus](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/27/us/gas-tax-cuts.html), it's not gonna help supply but sure [why not make it rain](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/04/29/2022-gas-stimulus-checks/9585306002/?gnt-cfr=1)\n\nNormal supply/demand dictates that if u have a fixed supply and increasing demand, price goes up until demand destruction. Oh gee I wonder what's gonna happen to price if governments are gonna do everything they can to avoid demand destruction by subsidizing it.\n\nOXY's last earnings 1.5B on 60B market cap. That's god damn 10 p/e. Look up any oilco and you'll see the same shit. Hella profits. Look at oil futures for any date to 2027.
