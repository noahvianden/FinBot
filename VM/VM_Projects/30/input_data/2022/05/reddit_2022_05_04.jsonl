Peter Lynch always said that PE should be in line with how fast a company is growing; if growing at 45% per year, then a PE of 45 is somewhere around fairly valued.\n\nYou are being unreasonable with PE expectations. 7-8 being a buy and 20 being a sell is way under historical averages. Incredibly so. And now with inflation, QE, and money printing being standard practice, it makes sense that PE ratios are being inflated. Coca-Cola is at 50 or something for God's sake. That's despite having NEGATIVE growth.\n\nYou aren't the only one who has been here for a long time, by the way. Get off your high horse and engage civilly or go away, you don't have to berate people just because they don't think as you do.
