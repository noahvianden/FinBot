Now because of war in Ukraine, inflation etc. many foteign investors are affraid of investing in Polish stock market, which I think is mistake, because it hits it's low and guarantees great returns in less than a year.\nAnother positive thing is that CDR might soon relase DLC or announce new game etc.\nBut apart for that average volume in last 3 months is about 380.000.

I do not necessarily agree ethically with this company or other monopolies like it, however, the relative stability of the investment, even though it won’t return 280% in a year, I believe it can be even more attractive than punts and other gambling activities, especially when you combine it with other consequential trades like a $TSLA short.
