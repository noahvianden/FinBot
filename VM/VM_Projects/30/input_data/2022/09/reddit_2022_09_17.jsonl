Since those economies are struggling right now  they are holding back demand for gold temporarily. \n\nThere’s also an opportunity cost perspective. Interest rates are high and gold has no yield so currently bonds are more appealing. Gold does best when interest rates are falling/low but inflation hasn’t been properly tamed yet. \n\nYou could also think of gold as a storehold of value that protects against currency devaluation, not inflation. A change in inflation is a change in the price of goods and services, while a currency devaluation is a change in the supply of money. This is why gold rose in price early on in covid when central banks printed lots of money to make up for a credit/spending contraction, meaning inflation was also low at the time. Now banks are doing aggressive quantitative tightening which is decreasing the money supply and raising the value of the currency as a storehold of wealth relative to gold, which is making gold go down in price.\n\nIf you ask me what to watch out for is if inflation is very sticky and growth slows down rapidly so that central banks become forced to switch to easing financial conditions before inflation is properly under control. If this happens then borrowing will pick up rapidly which will increase the supply of money. This plus increased demand from the easier policy will boost inflation.
