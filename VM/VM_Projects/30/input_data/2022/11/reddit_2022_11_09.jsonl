Say the price drops on some bad news.  Do you plan on selling more covered calls at less than you paid to enter?  That would mean if the price jumps back beyond your entry point you will be forced to sell at a loss and the premiums on OTM calls beyond your entry price may not be worth even selling.\n\nOne strategy to consider is the wheel. You sell cash covered puts on MSFT at below it's current value.  If it doesn't strike you collect premiums and repeat.  If it does you take possession of the stock and start selling covered calls.\n\nOne thing you really need to consider when messing with options is market events between now and your strike date.  If there's a big economic report on the horizon it could send stocks soaring or crashing, earnings are even more volatile.  Just make sure you understand what you are doing and have a plan before you jump in.  What are you going to do if MSFT drops 10% for example.
