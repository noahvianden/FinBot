{"title": "Why won't this work", "selftext": "I'm going to talk about puts since we are heading into a recession but I suppose the same could be true using calls in a bull market. \n\nIt's my understanding that if you buy a put, but the stock price never reaches your strike price then your option will expire worthless. On the other hand if you sell a put and the same thing happens then you get to keep your collateral and the premium from when you sold the put. So if you think the price will go down, why not buy a put for the price that you will think the stock will be under by expiration, and offset that cost by selling a put for below where you think the stock will go?\n\nAs the expiration draws closer the value of the sold option decays to 0 as long as the stock stays above it. So ideally you want the price to drop as close to that without going under as possible. Meanwhile on the other side the lower the stock goes the more valuable the put gets. If the price does drop below the price of the sold put and it starts becoming valuable again (meaning you would need to pay to close the position) those losses would be offset by the higher put also becoming more valuable. \n\nI don't see how this isn't just free money.", "id": "z737jq", "created_utc": 1669658055.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|115|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=z737jq)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=z737jq)\n\n^^WSB ^^[Stats](https://www.twitch.tv/wsbzjz/) ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: If you buy a put and the stock price doesn't reach your strike price, then you will lose money on the option.

{"title": "11-28-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Well the bulls came out swinging for about 15minutes and then after that the bears were in control all day. I called out this morning based on volatility that we could see 395 today… we had such a massive gap after that 399.2 support that it was the natural place we should move to. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qnwo7sqggr2a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=abf2ba3a3f27976acebf648f553204adc7d7f687\n\nInterestingly enough… after 393.7 support if we lose that volatility wise we have no real established support area until all the way down to 373.7. Could we be headed for a CPI gap fill over the next few weeks? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uulb209hgr2a1.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=f47ab0bb77cac550303eb25827940f1e4fb1da36\n\nI believe we have quite the bear case forming here on spy with a smaller bull potential. But lets take a look at what we have here now…\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qqlsg5qhgr2a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=203546bf0ee653d203b63ec303e2c475d05f5080\n\nLooking at SPY daily here I called out on Friday that I suspected that tiny gravestone doji double top rejection at 402.4 would open up the downside for today and I was correct. I should have played weekend swing puts but I was happy to sit cash as the weekends are pretty unpredictable as of late. \n\nBear case- today we opened red and attempted to retake the daily 200ema however was unable to, we broke the 3+ week long daily rising wedge pattern and we closed below the daily 8ema for the first time since the day before CPI. \n\nBull case- despite the rejection and closing under the daily 8 and 200ema we did bounce pretty hard off the key support range of 395 to 395.5 today. We are still maintaining that key lower support range of this consolidation pattern that SPY has been in since November 11th. \n\nFor me this breakdown shows that we have a potential to retest 390.1 support and potentially even lower depending on what JPOW says on Wednesday and depending on what all the economic data comes in at. I am bearish until we touch 390.1… If we touch and bounce off 390.1 again then I am seeing a nice consolidation channel from 390.1 to 402.5 and will play it at such. However if we break through and close under 390.1 then I am looking for at minimum the gap fill at 381.2. \n\nKey support- 396 -> 392.6 -> 390.1\n\nKey resistance- 399.2 -> 402.4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9yg2o8cigr2a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7777e1ba5e61d8807db2c0425b639b37064fc223\n\nMuch of the same case here on futures breaking that rising wedge. However, futures is still holding over one of the key support levels of 3970. If we see futures lose 3955 then I would feel confident in a 3910 retest of support. However, if futures can break back over 4000 we can start talking about a retest of 4020 and then 4040.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3v7aupuigr2a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f55ad1ead9b49c0b10d8422a4714ce3f91b96ae\n\nTesla has the biggest bearish case of them all in my opinion when we look at the daily chart. We had that green support line that was 3 days long until today. That line was broke through today we also failed to even reach the falling wedge resistance line before we retraced. With this gravestone doji closing at Fridays candle body support of 182.9 this should open up some pretty large downside tomorrow. The only real bullish case I see for Tesla right now is that it did recover and close back over its daily 8ema EOD. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sb5nbidjgr2a1.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e956cfe851e89a8798726f581aa3fa6c67216bc\n\nLast week I shared with you guys that tesla had a pretty uniformed drop and recovery cycle. I was seeing that we were averaging a drop of about 6.8 days for 17.82% while the recovery was about 4.5 days of 12.08%. \n\nWith todays new short term high we officially put in our 4th recovery day and reached 13.4% total recovery. \n\nIf we are trusting this trend that has been playing out for 3 months now that means we should expect about a 7day sell off of about 17.82% which puts Tesla at 154.9 around December 7th. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1l8qyrtjgr2a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7af3c1395a4edfaa0271107bcd192d0826b9512\n\nIf we play out the falling wedge here by December 7th we could see 148.7 which is a total drop of 21.2%. However if we play out the % drop of 17.82% but not the number of days it took to get there we could see by November 30th (2 days) a touch of the red support line at 154.5. \n\nRealistically I would look for a test of support near 148-155 in the next 4-7 trading days. Biggest support to break through though will be that 166.2 level. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nb5x4lckgr2a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=060a5fcfcccf160399b111c5fc56bbba73474559\n\nI don’t love post weekly charts so early in the week but we did break through the blue resistance line of this current downward trend today. However we immediately rejected and hard rejected off the weekly 200ema. Key support for this weekly timeframe is 180.1. This current bear channel (thick red support line) gives us intraweek support of 154 and next week support of 152. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i1ypnmtngr2a1.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b49e2fa1fe3ece40f4c34f686445047bba1158d\n\nAs much as I was looking for that 19.7 touch this week it appears that as of now we may not get it. We officially closed over the daily 8ema for the first time since October 14th. We are still in this bear channel though and its not quite time to get super excited but this is not a bad time in my opinion to start adding to some 30-60dte put positions. \n\n**$5k/ 10% challenge-** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ur18t0hlgr2a1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=dccb7cb11673a4f1a2eacd4b6a306c09af6f1a16\n\nWas able to get a nice put scalp in this morning for the $5k challenge. Still haven’t quite been able to get any good big scalp wins but I also don’t want to stretch these plays out. This is one of those times where if I had a standard position size (usually $2000 for me) I would sometimes hold a little longer but with this larger bigger $5000 position I am more apt to quickly take profits and to take the first hit of profits. \n\nThis is where the emotional side of trading comes in. \n\n**Daily log-** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3x7gr0mgr2a1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fccc2d95e2b22ee3d56cf1fc1318c5927a1e027\n\nOverall not a bad day and a great way to start the week off. Almost love starting the week off with a nice green day. Scalps were on fire today even if I closed them all early AF only for them all to 3-4x right after… but profit is profit! \n\nSome struggles with the level to level plays this morning. The first SPY put I played the bounce off 399.2 support however it was a fake bounce and broke down pretty quickly and I got out. I was just unfortunately too early on that first Tesla put and got stopped out before it saw green. \n\nNot a bad day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1angqsjmgr2a1.png?width=856&format=png&auto=webp&s=daeeb4c22ae758cb2fb6545bcde799f7e319c9e8\n\nLooks like a lot of you found green today too! \n\nHope you guys had a great day!
