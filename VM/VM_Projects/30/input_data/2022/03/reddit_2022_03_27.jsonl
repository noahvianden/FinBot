{"title": "Expected moves this week: SPY, QQQ, LULU, MU, CHWY, and more.", "selftext": "### The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week –** SPY was higher by about 1.8% on the week, in line with the 1.8% move options were pricing. Implied volatility was lower on the week.\n\n**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 1.5% move this week (about $7 in either direction).\n\n**Implied Volatility / VIX –** The VIX closed last week below 21. That is its lowest level since early February.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week**\n\n* SPY **1.5%** (about $7)\n* QQQ **2.2%** (about $8)\n* IWM **2.1%** (about $4.50)\n* DIA **1.2%** (about $4.50)\n\n### \n\n### In the News\n\nMeme/story stocks saw an uptick in activity last week, with unusual options volume and in many cases, increases in implied volatility. Here’s some highlights from last week with special focus on stocks that saw spikes in volume and IV. Many of these stocks had reached low dollar levels, so a quick change in sentiment ramps option volume and prices quickly. Increases of option volume vs 30 day average (on Friday), implied vol vs 360 realized vol (on Friday), and IV Rank that was unusual are indicated. This is by no means an exhaustive list but gives a good sense of what was happening as traders turned their attention to these types of stocks after a long lull:\n\n**BB:** option volume: +600% IV30 vs 1yr: +136%, IV rank: 100% (earnings, expected move this week: 11%)\n\n**BBBY:** IV30 vs 1yr: +148%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 11.5%)\n\n**GME:** option volume: +800%, IV30 vs 1yr: +127% (expected move this week: 13.5%)\n\n**NKLA:** option volume: + 400% IV30, vs 1yr: +127% (expected move this week: 9.5%)\n\n**TLRY:** option volume + 2300% IV30, vs 1yr: +207%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 20%)\n\n**CRON:** option volume: 1000% IV:30, vs 1yr +155%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 11%)\n\n**ACB:** option volume: +2000% IV30, vs 1yr +194%, IV rank: 100% (expected move this week: 17%)\n\n**RIOT:** option volume: +300% (expected move this week: 9%)\n\n**FUBO:** option volume: +300% (expected move this week: 8%)\n\nWhether this is a “dash for trash” towards the end of a big move higher in the broader market or the beginning of a turnaround in fortunes for stocks that had been left for dead remains to be seen. But it’s a reminder of how quickly increasing option volume can lead to large leaps in option prices in stocks with a history of “crashing higher.” Here’s a quick look at how many of these names show up on volume scanners from Friday (via Options AI):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/5hfl1geayyp81.gif\n\n## Earnings\n\n*Links* go to the Options AI calendar where you can see the other companies each day and click through to see charts (free to use).

This isn't  quite inflation, rather its asset prices recovering from decades of high rates that were siphoned off into the finance sector due to high interest rates, and as a result it will stop once assets reach a new equilibrium.

Tapering is a term that is also used to describe people who are trying to slowly come off drug addiction. There's good amount of evidence to suggest that the market is addicted to the feds support.

It just doesn't make sense that something could rise that much during a crisis.  Amd went from 45$ to 120$ during the same time frame. The sp500 went up about 25% and the dow 18%. The  Vanguard Total Stock Market Index is an accumulation of every us stocks price into one index. It went from 78$- 112$ per share within the same time frame.
