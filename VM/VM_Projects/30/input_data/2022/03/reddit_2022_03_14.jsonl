Having not had the time to test this myself, I have no experience yet to draw from.  I suppose it's more likely if one is selling calls or puts on a more volatile stock (GME, TSLA, the like), with the swings you may be forced to eat much more calendar time than with a more stable stock or index.\n\nI'd assume it's not infrequent that you're actually rolling or closing/opening positions at 50% profit within ~10-12 days of opening your position anyway, provided the underlying moves in your favour.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "To be clear, I have had puts I've rolled for months, so it can happen.  But aren't you going to be using the spatial to make other trades anyway?

This means they are less often to drop and not come back up fairly quickly.\n\nHow I see this is I will be making trades, be they selling puts, rolling puts, and then selling covered calls.
