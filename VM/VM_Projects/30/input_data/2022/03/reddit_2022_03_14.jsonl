But aren't you going to be using the spatial to make other trades anyway?  How is rolling out to collect credits much different than selling puts and collecting credits?\n\nI do trade boring high quality stocks that are not as volatile, and that I am happy to own if needed.  This means they are less often to drop and not come back up fairly quickly.\n\nHow I see this is I will be making trades, be they selling puts, rolling puts, and then selling covered calls.  How do you see this as tieing up any more or less collateral or taking any more time?
