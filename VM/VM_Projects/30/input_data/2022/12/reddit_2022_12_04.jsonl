Could this be when they expect coupon payments to become unbearable? \n\nAnd if they print more money to keep rates high artificially, is that taking too far a step back in taming inflation or could the Fed eventually ween us off that path once inflation is ~2-3%? If we’re only printing to pay off debt interest it would offload the inflation to bond holders, but could that cause bond holders to say fuck this and sell en masse?", "id": "zcpatg", "created_utc": 1670195970.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|93|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=zcpatg)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=zcpatg)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The E vanishing from the PE ratio, taking it to the moon.", "score": 28, "replies": []}, {"body": "They can't print $ to pay off debt with high inflation.
