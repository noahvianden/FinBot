These two news outlets often exaggerate Tesla news, but probably not this time.\n- Tesla cannot ship much more than RoRo capacity - which is at a fixed limit and hard to expand: these big ocean going ships are expensive and have years of lead time.\n- There's also the end of Chinese EV incentives at December 31, which probably pulled forward some demand - so they don't want to over-produce for Q1.\n- While the China Covid wave still isn't affecting Shanghai directly, it will indirectly affect ability of customers to take delivery - and will also cause postponement of purchases.\n- Tesla could drop prices now - and I'd guess that Tesla will probably drop prices early January - but together with the Covid wave there's now a limit on delivery capacity and they are probably playing it cautiously.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "If it's indeed an internal demand issue, I would expect the upcoming Corona lockdown ending to cover it.

As seen, Tesla China is implementing more and more incentives for consumers to buy their vehicles. However, this is only **ONE** source and is **NOT** confirmed! This is purely speculation and not something that should be read into too much.\n\nIt could also be retooling of the factory, pandemic restrictions, delivery infrastructure, China recession, etc. etc. We will just have to be patient and wait for more information on the matter.\n\nPersonally I am a little worried. China is pumping out cars likes there is no tomorrow, but the fact all the incentives and price cuts has happened over the past 2 months points towards the market not being as stable as we would like currently.

What made Giga Shanghai so efficient was its ability to constantly tweak deliveries between EU and Asia.

The product and margins are amazing, people love it, production is pristine, everything is working as it is supposed to - but the market is shitting itself right now across the globe. And if the Asia market retracts, Giga Shanghai cant off-load is produce to other continents given that there are already Giga Factories supplying those areas.\n\nHowever, one theory I'm personally hoping for is that the new US incentives will boost demand so god damn much that Giga Shanghai has to send vehicles to the US.
