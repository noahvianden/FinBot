He also confirmed that savings over the cost of operating conventional big rigs would pay them back over that duration.\n\nO'Connell went on to outline the company is moving Frito-Lay \"food products\" on routes within a 425-mile range, while trucks carrying the heavier PepsiCo soda cans were confined to shorter routes within 100 miles. He did confirm that after hitting the 425-mile mark, there was still about a 20% charge on the battery, and it took approximately 35 to 45 minutes to recharge fully.\n\nIt makes sense for the company to take things slow to test out the capabilities of its new Semis. The other thing to consider is how PepsiCo and Frito-Lay set up their intrastate distribution systems. Perhaps soda products are stored and routed differently than lighter food products.\n\nOliver Dixon, a senior analyst at the consulting firm Guidehouse, thinks Tesla still has \"a lot to prove\" to commercial distribution fleets because \"dragging a trailer full of chips around is not the most intense, tough ask.\"", "id": "ztmku7", "created_utc": 1671815234.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "I've worked in trucking. The comment regarding the 100 mile routes is likely saying the trucks will just be used for short dedicated routes. Not that they get that range.\n\nEdit: It's fairly common for trucking companies to have short route dedicated loads. This is where the Semi would excel until they can get a truck that has the same range as a ice semi.\n\nEdit2: Or until they build out semi chargers. I think 800-1000 mile range would be the sweet spot for long haul assuming semi chargers are readily available at stops.", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Am I crazy? In the states aren't truckers limited to something like 10 or 11 hours of driving a day?

They used to get around that but pretty much impossible now with computers (telematics systems) being installed on every truck. Now as long as there is a mega charger at a driver's stop or break spot they should not be or be much less range limited. Building out mega chargers will take time though but not like Tesla doesn't have the resources to do that if they prove their product.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Why would you need 800 miles of range if the charging network is good enough? You're only allowed to drive 8 hours before the mandatory 30 min break. If you charge during that break, you'll easily charge enough to drive the remaining 3 hours.\n\nSo all you need is enough range to drive 8 hours, which is 560-640 miles depending on the state's speed limit. And that's not even accounting for energy recuperation and how you're not constantly driving on the highway. Nor the fact that you could drive 2 x 5.5 hours instead, which would mean you only need 385-440 miles of range.\n\nSeems like 500 miles is actually the sweet spot for unlimited range.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Existing ice semis can have over 1500 miles of range. Fuel stops are already built out everywhere. Smaller trucking companies are not great at optimizing their routes.

What are the costs associated with having a car being idle?
