In this case, where they caused a dramatic increase in the deficit, they did. Not all tax cuts create deficits, but Trump’s did. It’s perfectly possible to cut taxes and reduce spending to balance the budget. But when you don’t do that, and you take out a loan and give that money straight to consumers, it obviously will increase inflation because you just shelled out a ton of cash to consumers that they weren’t supposed to have.\n\nThis is not unique to tax cuts, many forms of stimulus have a similar effect, such as infrastructure investments. This creates new jobs for American businesses to build infra, which then hands them the cash, which then goes to consumers. Tax cuts are just more direct.\n\nIt’s not ‘gov spending’ or ‘tax cuts’, what we’re really discussing is the budget and whether it’s balanced, and where the spending is going. Any sort of spend that ends up in the hands of the American people, that increased the debt, is basically increasing the number of dollars in circulation, and in the hands of consumers.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Look I understand how deficit works. My issue is tax cuts do not cause the inflation. Spending over the budget does. That's not a tax cut problem though. Also not any presidents direct fault either.

Anyway the inflation didn't show up until after trillions in stimulus came out and that is what really kicked inflation off not any tax cuts.

Seems to anyone with half a brain it was the trillions in spending that made inflation worse than it's been in 40+ years. The tax cuts have zero to do with it because even without them the trillions spent would have still been trillions more than the deficit. Also the IRS revenue grew from 2017-2021 so the tax cuts didn't bring revenue down from previous years. I know it's less than they projected to bring in but those were projections and are often wrong also. \n\nThe inflation we see today is the cause of Trump and Biden stimulus with fed money printing.
