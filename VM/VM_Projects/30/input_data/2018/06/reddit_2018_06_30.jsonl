Burying users in content. You have to kill good ideas to focus sometimes. The whole is less than the sum of its parts. HBO made the point that they go to all their kids soccer games. Netflix goes to none of theirs because they have too many. In the long term I see Netflix as a channel like HBO that will be provided through a platform owned by somebody like Amazon. In short term it is still a buy and has legs. Long term, it is AOL down to the bad connection speeds. \n\nNetflix cannot say NO. No is very important. They pick up shows other networks have dropped because people ask them to. They say yes to everything. You know how Yoko Ono reeled in John Lennon? She created an art piece with one word on it, YES. And that begin Ono's taking over of his life. The word yes. \n\n‚ÄúPeople think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done.

You have to kill things. Tesla has a problem killing things too. But most of the species that have ever lived are dead and they are dead because of the focus of natural selection.
