{"title": "Buying Opportunity", "selftext": "There’s a lot of deals out there if you can stomach it, folks.  The economic indicators are very well intact so if you’re long, I would think twice about selling. \n\nI left the market around 2,800 as I thought we were a bit inflated.  I just bought leap calls yesterday in sectors I think are a little too low. \n\nAAPL - -40%+- Every time there’s a bad quarter, analysts say “it’s just a phone company”.  Meanwhile, their cash reserves are greater than many sovereign nations. \n\nNFLX - -40%+- This is a bit of a risky play as they were super high to begin with, and with Disney’s upcoming service, they may take a hit.  Still, I think they’ll be around for a while. \n\nUPRO - -50%+- 3X ETF for SPY.  This is self explanatory.  Barring a recession which is unlikely, the market should rebound within the next 6-12 months. \n\nJNUG - -60%+- 3X ETF for gold miners.  Relatively safe play if the economy continues to crap itself.  And, decent volatility to boot. \n\nUSO- -45%+- Oil. Same as JNUG, relatively safe play. \n\nJNJ- -15+- This company is just solid for any portfolio. \n\nGE- A LOT+- This is a fairly risky play but I’m banking on the fact they get their act together in 2019.  However, titans fall from time to time. Just look at Sears, though I’d say this is much different than retail. \n\nFB- -45%+- I’ve always disliked this company based on their subscriber rates being close to full attrition for years now.  However, based on the scandals and market correction, they’ve taken a beating.  People forget they print cash. \n\nAMZN- -30%+- It’s amzn, what else needs to be said?  The only issue they face is government regulation and that has yet to be acknowledged so they’ll continue to be a juggernaut.  If you look back to 2016 and bought leap calls in February for a mere $10,000 investment, it could’ve netted 2.2 million dollars.  \n\nSQQQ- And here’s the safety net. Should everything fail before expiry, this etf will provide an equal balance sheet, at least.  This is risky as it’s affected by interest rates and contango but if you keep an eye on it, you should be fine.  Short term only or you’ll get eaten alive.  For the more risk centric investors, VXX.  However, you’ll need balls of steel. \n\nI’m not advising anyone to do anything, I’m just sharing what I started scaling into yesterday.  Before you panic, understand that the market always goes up over time because it has to, based on our economic model.  YoY we’re down roughly 8% and if we hit 2,400, we’ll be down 22% from ATHs just a couple of months ago.  These type of drops don’t happen very often during a spurring economy so do your research and understand the cycles.  \n\nI could be wrong but if I am, we’re going into to a recession anyway.  And if that’s true, I’ll just keep averaging down.
