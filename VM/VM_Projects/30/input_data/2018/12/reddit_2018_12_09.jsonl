If China does well, then they might have additional markets, etc.  If China doesn't do well, I think their selling to US market and getting into domestic industries like Health Care and Fintech would still be fine.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Has risen quite a bit already in recent years, rise has been meteoric, not sure whether it has room to go.  PE is high.\n* Feud between Bezos and Trump might get ugly esp. given former is unwilling to budge and latter is vengeful\n* Not a big fan of their Whole Foods acquisition, but it is what it is\n* Also, to be level, unclear ultimately whether their initiatives will actually revolutionize the industry or is mere hype\n\nYour thoughts?", "id": "a4orcr", "created_utc": 1544389495.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "AWS is huge.

At some point, these visas will likely be cancelled.\n\n3)  The US is at \"peak consumer\".  It will be hard to grow if consumerism declines.

I invested in AMZN in mid October 2017, that investment more than doubled in less than a year, I got in before the market started to crash, and lets be real y’all the market is crashing right now, but that’s a historical pattern. So my investment might end up right back where it first started, maybe maybe not, but I wouldn’t pull out any of that investment unless I absolutely have to because I deem it to be a long term investment. So if you’re going to invest, look at it as something you would be holding for more than a few years, investing in anything in life is a commitment which takes time, patience, good days and bad days and overtime you’ll either see that investment grow and become what you hoped it to be if not even better or you don’t and you change direction. So if you have enough money to put in to AMZN right now at the current market value then do it, but do it with a realistic expectation. I think one of the biggest misconceptions of the stock market is that it’s fast money and people get really rich off of taking risks, that’s not true, people who get rich from the stock market are typically long term investors who let their portfolio build over time, and view it as savings plan for their future, a lot of those people contrary to popular belief started out with hardly anything, but they kept moving forward with their goals and what they believed in, some people yes they do get rich fast from lucky investments but they are more often the exception to the rule, so are you intending to invest long term or are you expecting to make a lot of money in a short period of time?
