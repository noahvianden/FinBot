Check it again in about an hour and it will likely have the data.\n\nThat said, those are level 1 bids and ask amounts (and possibly only nasdaq's quotes). In practice there's bids and asks on up to 15 US eqoptions exchanges and there's going to be bids and asks at prices behind the level 1 bids/asks. So there's not a clear and straight answer. It's like if you had infinite money, how many apple shares could you buy? Well the answer is all of them. The more important is how many can I buy before the price is pushed $X away from where it is now. To know that you need level 2 data for all exchanges. When you trade for real you'll notice that when you put in orders that it will cause other orders to move around.\n\nFor an underlying like AAPL you could probably do 1000 contracts without the price moving much (assuming one of the more popular strikes and expirations), but I don't trade anywhere near that so I don't know for sure. Part of the issue is that if you put in an order, some market makers and HFTs will pull their quotes before your order gets fully executed, so it's difficult to say for sure.\n\nAs far as when the next options expirations become available, you should take a look at this -- http://www.cboe.com/products/options-on-single-stocks-and-exchange-traded-products/options-on-single-stocks/equity-options-specs\n", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "This is wrong.
