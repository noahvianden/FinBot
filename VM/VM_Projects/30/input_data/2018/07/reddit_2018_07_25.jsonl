I'm trading as an individual Investor for 2 years with around $15k in capital currently.\n\nBefore the last recession in 2007 the US Interest rates were around 5% and Eurozone at 3.25% (very high levels for our times).\n\nNow approaching 10 years since the last recession the US interest rates are climbing and it looks like recession is on the way (with the flattening yield curve).\n\nHowever Eurozone interest rates are at historic lows at -0.40% with no hike in sight.\n\nWith that in mind, It looks like US is due for a recession with high interest rates and 105% Debt to GDP. While the Eurozone seems nowhere near it with Dept to GDP at 85% and interest rates at historic lows.\n\nQuestion is how to play off the situation? Equities seem dangerous everywhere. EU bonds are hardly worth it.\n\nTo me it seems like the only possible plays are Short ETF's or Long Term US Bond ETF's (Sadly I can't invest in them because of the EU regulation...)\n\nThat leaves the only possibility to make some profits from FOREX. Im currently holding a 10k Euro short position (because the difference in central bank policy). But I think that in an event of a Recession the dollar will fall and I should be Long EUR/USD or CHF/USD.\n\nThose are my thoughts. Please leave out yours so I could see someone else's point of view.

Selling ITM calls is also a great way to finance buying puts if you think the share price is going to go down.

Would it fill?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes it would fill, but deep ITM calls are counter productive as you gain little to any extrinic value but you give up a big chunk of your buying power. For example, you can sell the $80 call for PYPL for this week for $11.55, thats a meesly $0.20 in premium you recieve compared to just selling off your shares. On the other hand selling the $88 call gives you $4.70, thats a more reasonable $1.30 in extra premium. ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You know I’m not paying attention.
