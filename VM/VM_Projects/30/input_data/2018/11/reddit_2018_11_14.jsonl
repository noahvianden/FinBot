The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection‚Äôs (‚ÄúCal Fire‚Äù) Camp Fire Incident Report dated November 13, 2018, 7:00 a.m. Pacific Time (the ‚Äúincident report‚Äù), indicated that the Camp Fire had consumed 125,000 acres and was 30% contained. Cal Fire estimates in the incident report that the Camp Fire will be fully contained on November 30, 2018. In the incident report, Cal Fire reported 42 fatalities. The incident report also indicates the following: structures threatened, 15,500; single residences destroyed, 6,522; single residences damaged, 75; multiple residences destroyed, 85; commercial structures destroyed, 260; commercial structures damaged, 32; and other minor structures destroyed, 772.\n\n\r> The cause of the Camp Fire is under investigation.

In the afternoon of November 8, PG&E observed by aerial patrol damage to a transmission tower on the Caribou-Palermo 115 kV Transmission line, approximately one mile north-east of the town of Pulga, in the area of the Camp Fire. This information is preliminary.‚Äù Also on November 8, 2018, acting governor Gavin Newsom issued an emergency proclamation for Butte County, due to the effect of the Camp Fire.\n\n\r> As previously reported, during the third quarter of 2018, PG&E Corporation and the Utility renewed their liability insurance coverage for wildfire events in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.4 billion for the period from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019. For more information about wildfire insurance and risks associated with wildfires, see PG&E Corporation and the Utility‚Äôs quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018.\rWhile the cause of the Camp Fire is still under investigation, if the Utility‚Äôs equipment is determined to be the cause, the Utility could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage that would be expected to have a material impact on PG&E Corporation‚Äôs and the Utility‚Äôs financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I guess the general concensus is: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nLooks like a very bad spot they're in.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It kinda does.... but I‚Äôm tempted to buy some.
