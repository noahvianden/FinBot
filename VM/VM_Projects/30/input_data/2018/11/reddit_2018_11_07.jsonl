Take the remaining 1801.62 and buy some stock in blue chip companies that pay a consistent quarterly dividend and let the dividends reinvest. I have 18 shares in Amazon right now, I bought the first 12 at like $990 a share in 2017 and bought another 6 when it had dropped down below 2000 a few months ago so I made a profit on my first 12, but lost on the other 6 (I wish I had waited, but what can you do?) I plan on holding those 18 shares for now. I know Berkshire Hathaway is a different kind of industry, but the class A stock was at $19 in the 60’s and is now worth $330,000 a share. I’m not sure Amazon could go that far or not, but I’d like to be in on that if it ever did. Historically Amazon is a slow mover with a lot of volatility in between, but that also comes with consistent growth in the end, but it takes a lot of time, patience and detachment over worrying about the day to day, and even month to month or year because it’s not just going to magically pop up and make you a millionaire and if you go in with that expectation you’ll end up pulling out to soon when your expectations aren’t met.

{"title": "DD SVMK Short", "selftext": " Survey Monkey (SVMK) is an overpriced turd that should have never IPO'd. This is my first DD so please comment if I miss it get something wrong. The quick: over $1 billion market cap, they do not expect to turn a profit anytime soon (profit starts in 2023!), and only expect a quarterly 3% growth of paying customers with a product that is not special. This is an easy short.\n\nCredit Suisse places a 3% terminal growth rate, or a 11.5% WACC. Indeed there is growth expected for this company, but you have to look at the company finances, current environment, product moat, and management to see how this is another Snapchat, GoPro, Blue Apron, etc.\n\n*This company has been around since 1999. I've had no luck finding past financial information prior to 2017 (I might not be looking in the correct spot), but they currently report that they are losing money with no plans to quickly become profitable (positive EPS projected in 2023). Nearly a 20 year old company and it still can't turn a profit? What a great company to invest in! They IPO'd so they could raise money to refinance their debt. While this is a positive thing, when you look at expected revenue (249mil in 2018, 283 in 2019) and expected income after all expenses (-154mil in 2018, -69mil in 2019), why would this be a good investment? It could be if they had high growth with a high profit margin, but they don't.\n\n*As you are all aware with the fun we had in October, many companies that were expected to continue their high future growth (while actually making a large profit today..Apple, Amazon..) saw their valuations get destroyed. Go Trump for future uncertainty! So why does SVMK have a market cap over 1 billion (currently around 1.2b)? Are they expected to suddenly make boatloads of cash in the future? No they aren't (I guess this is a continuation of point 1). In 2023 they expect to have an EPS of 0.05 with 138million shares. They are issuing stock as a form of compensation to employees, continuing the devaluing of current shareholders. There are currently 108 million shares outstanding. That 2023 year, they expect to profit a laughable 27.5 million. At current valuation, that's a P/E of 200 in 2023! Even a modest 50 P/E (sorry MU) and you get a market cap of ~250 million...in 4 years. Today's market cap should be much much less as there are no guarantees they will ever turn a profit.\n\n*Moat: how hard is it to build a survey site and show some statistics on collected data? I could hire a programmer to setup a SQL database running on AWS, produce some graphs and basically have the same product. Google, or anyone, could easily undercut SVMK prices and destroy their expected ‘growth’ of customers. And repeat customers could easily change survey providers (typing this made me lol) if their price is better. There is nothing special that keeps the customer with SVMK. From a paying customer standpoint: print the survey results, present graphs to management, and file away for that quarter/year. All you need to do is ask the same questions and produce the same graphs/statistics and you have the same result from a different company.

I'm not going to really analyze this as it could mean nothing, but seeing GoPro and Yahoo (for CPO) doesn't scream a solid team. Who knows, they may have been some of the ‘good ones’. Same with COO (formerly worked for Google) and CSO (worked for Amazon, eBay, and Adobe). They formerly worked for great companies. Why didn't they stay; perhaps they couldn't hack it and got demoted to be a survey monkey.\n\n*One thing I don't like about shorting Snapchat (or other similar popular shorts) is everyone is doing it. If enough idiots think Snap is on sale, it will short squeeze. This happened early this year when it went above $20. I got burned on that ER and my puts were too short term. Good news, SVMK has low short interest with only 1 day for shorts to cover (reported 10/15). Also not many people are talking about SVMK. This should be safe(er) from a short squeeze and buying puts now is getting in before everyone is shouting about how crappy and overpriced it is. \n\nSo what am I doing? I'd like to get some leap puts but the furthest options out are 4/18/19.  I bought a few 7.5P. Lockup ends on 3/25/19 so that could be another catalyst for a nose dive, and these puts expire after that so they could get juicy. With the horrible growth projections and financial position, I don't see how this company could have a market cap of 200mil today. If they prove to be on track in 2020, maybe be worth 200, and then slowly increase. These guys aren't making the big bucks, they are barely staying in business.  And if things don't go well, expect stock dilution and more loans. And we all know where loan interest rates are going.\n\nAnd a final word: the financial analysts that have outperform ratings (JPMorgan, UBS Group, JMP Securities, Merrill Lynch, Suntrust) on SVMK are doing this because they had a hand in the IPO. They can't say ‘short this turd, it's overpriced’ when they just gave it a $13/share or 1.4 billion valuation when it IPO'd last month. I only wish I would have come across this company and looked into their finances when it had its initial pop to short it then. Oh well, I still think this one has a long way to fall.\n\nSome additional reading:\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2018/10/22/surveymonkey-stock-once-again-sells-for-its-ipo-pr.aspx\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/09/26/get-the-key-details-on-surveymonkeys-svmk-ipo/#3b40ae45719b\n\n", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "ok but what fd do I buy?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "this isn't an FD play.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I mean you could go FD route, I just don't know when this egg will crack so I want time.
