Bezos preaches **treating every day as though it‚Äôs day one**\n\n‚ÄúPoor experience‚Äù, what a joke!!! Have you gone out shopping recently, how much fun are those long ass lines? Enjoy *physically* searching stores for something? Traffic? Parking? Limited hours of operation? \n\nHow about being **the** leader of the cloud! How about MSFT‚Äôs **Azure being down for most of last week** which they blamed on overheating, yet still in breach of SLA *for almost entire work week*.?\n\nHow about **practical marketing opportunity**.?\n\nHow about superb AI and ML platforms?\n\nHow about upcoming $10B government JEDI contract, which only potential contender MSFT just *pissed away their piddly chances due to their display of shittyness last week.*?\n\nWhat about overhauling Healthcare working with BRK and JPM?\n\nWhat about their ability to destroy and incumbent in virtually any industry by leveraging their considerable tech and logistics resources?\n\nWhat about their leader who is richest man in world yet still focuses on customer experience and NOT bottom line - the same man that **ran AMZN with ZERO PROFIT for over a decade**?\n\nWhat about Alibaba being a joke of an AMZN Chinese copycat, oh btw Jack Ma is retiring tomorrow, reassuring?\n\nWhat about smart speakers now available in almost any language, including very difficult Japanese language?\n\nScared of regulation? Anti-trust laws exist *solely* to *protect consumers*, but AMZN is *undisputedly beneficial* to consumers.\n\nTL;DR. Article is pure crap, writer probably a perma-bear shitstain Doug Kass wannabe, Wrong on so many levels is either an idiot or bullshitter.  **AMZN has the longest legs of any existing company PERIOD.**\n\nWho disagrees any why!?!? \n\nI‚Äôll start, the only legitimate vulnerability to AMZN is ‚Äòkey man risk‚Äô, however papa Bezos has best security the richest man in world can buy.
