{"title": "The Buffet Indicator", "selftext": "The Buffet Indicator is a method of determining if a market is undervalued or overvalued based on it's total market valuation divided by the markets GDP. Here is a link that goes into more detail: [https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php](https://www.gurufocus.com/stock-market-valuations.php) . It's interesting to note that during the 2000 tech bubble crash, the market was at 142% of it's GDP meaning that the market was overvalued by 42% or by roughly $5 Trillion (Total GDP was only 10 Trillion). This was at the peak of the tech bubble before it popped and the market corrected. From 2003 - 2006 the market recovered and GDP and the market valuations were in sync.. then we began to inflate the market into 2008 and the market popped again. Since 2008, interest rates have been 0 and QE has inflated the market to historic highs.. the market is currently overvalued by 9 Trillion dollars and again is sitting at 142% of GDP. This is considered SIGNIFICANTLY OVERVALUED territory, and with the economic contraction that's taking place.. GDP will decline further making the market even more overvalued... IMHO, the market is propped up on hype and cheap money/leverage...the value of the market will have to correct to meet our GDP and I believe that correction is starting and will continue for the next 2 years.", "id": "9pldek", "created_utc": 1539966177.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 39, "comments": [{"body": "So which date should I pick for my puts?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Dec 18 2019.
