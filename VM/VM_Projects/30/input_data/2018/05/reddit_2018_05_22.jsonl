If you compare their current stock price to the last time markets were doing this well (January) the stock is a steal.  Most stocks are back to where they were prior to the February correction, WMT is still down over 25%.  Does that make any sense for the largest retailer in the world? No it really doesn't. Low volume and $3.5B in shorts is the only thing holding it back at this point.\n\nIt's like when I bought up AMD at 1.62-1.65 two years ago, the price simply doesn't make sense.
