The bank still hadn’t officially signed on when Musk [said on Twitter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-14/musk-working-with-silver-lake-goldman-to-take-tesla-private-jkt0o4sj) late Monday that he’s working with Goldman Sachs and private-equity firm Silver Lake as financial advisers, the people said.\n\nSuch a statement from a public company CEO typically signals a formal agreement. But Musk has shown a willingness to take an unusual approach, including tweeting last week that he had funding secured for a take-private deal. That declaration has prompted regulatory scrutiny and investor lawsuits.\n\n[Read more: Musk’s explanation unlikely to get SEC off his back](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-13/musk-s-belated-explanation-is-unlikely-to-get-sec-off-his-back)\n\nConversations are ongoing between Goldman Sachs and Musk, said the people, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public.\n\n### Informal Advice\n\nSilver Lake appears to be in a similar situation. The technology-focused firm isn’t working for Musk in an official capacity as a financial adviser and isn’t being compensated as a consultant, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Instead, Tesla’s CEO is hoping to tap Silver Lake’s experience working on some of the biggest take-private transactions -- including Michael Dell’s $21.7 billion buyout of his namesake computer company and its subsequent $67 billion acquisition of EMC Corp. -- to help get a deal done, the person said.\n\nEach of those transactions involved the firm making an equity commitment to help fund the deal. While Silver Lake hasn’t committed any financing to Musk’s possible buyout of Tesla, the firm hasn’t ruled out potentially making an investment at some point, the person said.\n\nA spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Representatives for Silver Lake and Tesla didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nMusk’s latest tweet came just hours after he said Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund had first approached him about helping take Tesla private early last year, and that the fund’s interest gave him the confidence to state publicly that he was thinking about the move.\n\n“I left the July 31st meeting with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving,” Musk [wrote](https://www.tesla.com/blog/update-taking-tesla-private) in a blog post Monday.\n\nTesla’s board is in the process of selecting financial advisers to evaluate Musk’s proposal. It has [formed a special committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-14/tesla-go-private-effort-advances-with-board-panel-to-study-offer), according to a statement Tuesday, which will take legal advice from Latham & Watkins LLP and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.", "id": "97bea4", "created_utc": 1534275177.0, "score": 95, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "High as fuck CEO Tweets fake funding secured to get Shorts off his back. \n\nAnd now  big daddy SEC is on his back\n\nIronically Tesla will now be ( Again) the most shorted stock in history after this development. \n\nThis is NOT gonna end well for Elon and Tesla.

A lot of your actions seem inherently contradictory to your goal of low risk, slow growth. I'm gunna break my advice down into 2 categories: picking stocks, and macro investing strategies. \n\nLets start with investing strategy: \n\n\\- Assuming that you are planning to have this money invested for 3-5-10 years (thinking long term), you need to start to train your self to buy and forget. You should rethink/rebalance your portfolio MAYBE once or twice a year but ideally, if you put in your work initially, you shouldnt have to do much tinkering. So, unless your trading, your conclusion that you shouldn't buy or hold through an ER seems pretty incorrect to me. \n\n\\- There is top down investing and bottom up investing (look it up if you don't know already). For top down strategies, ERs should be pretty irrelevant except for maybe when you are trying to find a good entry/exit point. For bottom up strategies, it could be more relevant, but even then you are going to have to hold your stock through an ER. \n\n\\- Sometimes selling your losers is the right thing to do. But, you shouldnt just sell because its losing, you should sell because you realize that you made a fundamental miscalculation or the market has somehow shifted (china trade shit showing up out of nowhere, for example). \n\n\\- If you are new to investing, I would recommend not taking a highly active hand with your portfolio. Most will agree that time in the market will yield returns...start with that and then once you become more experienced, slowly start to manage your positions a bit more. Generally tho, it sounds like you have been trading which is an entirely different ballgame. \n\nAs far as stocks go:\n\n\\- Personally (I have a very high risk appetite and im currently invested almost 100%in tech), I view Tesla as an extremely risky stock. I would nix it...especially now that there is some crazy talk of going private.\n\n\\- Twitter is a speculative growth stock to the max. Nix it also. Stocks like Netflix will also be relatively speculative and high growth but at least have a bit more to show for it. \n\n\\- IMO when it comes to tech, the real anchors are AMZN, microsoft, aapl, fb, google. Personally, I think those stocks have a lot of backbone compared to AMD, tesla, twitter. I also really like NVDA but im probably just blind and partial since I got lucky and bought at $55. \n\n\\- If I were in your shoes right now, I would take 10-15k of my portfolio and buy 1k of an s&p ETF every other week until it runs out. DCA is a powerful tool and I personally believe that a well balanced portfolio should have a healthy dose of  broad base index at its core.
