{"title": "I bought the OptionAlpha toolbox pro for $500 usd AMA", "selftext": "Long story short, it's nothing like advertised and I'm looking for a refund. My recommendation, save your money, just use the OA free learning resources. The \"backtester\" tells you nothing you wouldn't already know by looking at probability of expiring ITM/OTM on your option chain.\n\nI wanted to verify the viability of some of the strategies I've been using to collect premium for the past few months(mostly selling Iron condors on various ETFs which has been going well). It's nothing revolutionary or new, I'm just selling contracts with 80%ish historical probability of expiring worthless using think or swim to analyze my trades and robinhood to execute orders. My aim here was to buff my edge by being able to recognize WHEN selling was most viable in relation technical analysis, or IV (whatever) to turn my probability of profit from 80% to maybe 90%.\n\nSince I'm novice I used a few different learning tools like OA, and TW tv to learn the basics of options trading. Option Aplha offered thier toolbox pro, with backtesting \"software\" for roughly $500 smackers US. I was sold on the video ad OA put together for it, advertising \"millions of different strategies in different market conditions\". When I started using the tool I quickly realized it wasn't \"software\" like they sell it, it's just a graphic interface on their webpage, no different from the demo version they have up for anyone to use. It minimally covers basic strategies, IC, strangle, straddle, spreads etc and this is the real kicker; the \"any market you could think to trade\" is really just a short list of liquid options markets.. SPY AMZN AAPL EEM. there's about 20 entries if that... you can't test a strategy with a short strike greater than .25 (why? no clue..) and the tool is broken to boot. Some drop downs don't load in, or load into different places without and actual drop down menu to choose from, sometimes it just fails on error when run, it's pretty bad. A short strangle sold weekly on SPY for the past 10 years net 176% returns apparently, but if you choose to sell Iron condors instead with the same short delta, time until expiration, and other specifics, you somehow lose everything in  about a years time. Which makes absolutely zero sense to me. You'd be short the same strikes every week how does covering your trade with a couple long strikes suddenly flip the viability of selling premium? This to me is a problem with the script, not with iron condors. In the promo video Kirk states he paid 250K out of pocket to develop this tool.. I have to call bullshit, I've seen web tools much more refined that were made for much much less. If he really did pay $250K in dev and QA he got absolutely ripped off.\n\n(\\*\\*EDIT:\\*\\* I'm happy to say I couldn't have been more wrong when I made the following assumption, I'll leave it in the post for context purposes, but I'd like it noted by anyone reading this that OA and Kirk had reached out and offered a refund in full within a timely manner. My assumption was unfair and unwarranted at the time, a byproduct of cynicism. There are a lot of service providers in this field that are happy to take peoples money without a care as to whether or not their customers are happy with the end result, I can say without a doubt OptionAlpha/Kirk are the exception to this, and their customer service response has been nothing short of phenomenal.)\n\nI don't expect to get my money back, I anticipate some \"all sales are final\" reply in my mailbox in the coming days. I'll update here accordingly, who knows maybe I will be refunded, in which case I'll feel less taken advantage of.\n\nUpdate: OA reached out. Kirk (or who I believe to be Kirk) mailed back himself offering either a refund or to gift me another report(I‚Äôm guessing that means some other tool or book OA offers, nothing mentioned specifically) He was very understanding and sympathetic. I‚Äôm taking the refund but I really can‚Äôt speak well enough about the learning material OA has to offer, I don‚Äôt want this post to take away from the value that offers new traders.", "id": "98v4ah", "created_utc": 1534782790.0, "score": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 40, "comments": [{"body": "Hey all, Kirk here from Option Alpha. Sorry that you didn't feel it was worth the money and I wanted to share some things that might help.\n\n1. We are already aware that the current data is a little behind on the backtester, still more than 10 years of data which is more than many others have, but we are in the process of actually switching it all over to a \"live version\" that quickly updates data on the fly each week. The idea is that this will dramatically improve the performance and longevity for everyone.\n2. Many of the failed backtests for people we see are because it triggers illiquid options or strikes. We built in some logic that if you tried to trade say a $10 wide strike on a $10 ETF, well there's nothing there to trade so it wouldn't return results. Same for liquidity of further out strikes on some stocks and ETFs.\n3. Cost wise, I did personally, pay well north of $250k (and continue to invest personally) in this software. Development, storing and security the data is very expensive. The amazon servers each month alone to store and run the data is a couple thousand dollars. So, feel free to call BS but nobody has as much data as we do in this space right now.\n4. Value wise I think what we offer is insane for this tool. Is it perfect - of course not, which is why we are investing to improve it. But you couldn't buy data for just 1 ticker for a anything close than the one-time cost we have for this software. Do all the backtested strategies show profits, of course not and they shouldn't. If every strategy you run through the system showed a profit then what would be the point right? It's built so that you can test your strategy ideas and frameworks first without wasting money in the open market testing with real money.\n\nHope this helps and always available to help with questions.\n\nBest,\n\nKirk", "score": 93, "replies": [{"body": "hi Kirk,\n\n  \nI would like to discuss option alpha with you.
