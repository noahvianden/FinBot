I do believe in the firm and would like to bet on an appreciation in share price, potentially the 420$ buyout. My trade idea would be Long 20/01/2020 350C and Short 20/01/2020 370C. That would cost me about 1000$. Let's say the firm would be bought out for 420$ or otherwise rise above 370, I would make 1000$ on my trade, right?", "id": "97jqo6", "created_utc": 1534350765.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "*game*", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Just a bit of background: My first touch with options was on r/WallStreetBets, that might expalin it...", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "so what the fuck are you doing asking these people? come back over to the bois and make some trendies my guy.
