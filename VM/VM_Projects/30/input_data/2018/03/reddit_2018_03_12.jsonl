Energy companies don't trade at nearly as high a multiple as, say, a decent software company. This is because different industries have different potential for earnings growth. An oil company will be heavily followed by analysts, its revenue is predictable and closely linked to readily available information like crude oil prices, therefore there are fewer surprises and fewer reasons to pay a premium for such a company. Amazon trades at such a high multiple because of its unique position as the leader in e- commerce. Also because of the numerous ventures the company is exploring that investors believe have potential for revenue and earnings growth. \n\nPE ratio can be used to get an idea for investor sentiment; bullish or optimistic for high PE ratio, bearish or doubtful for low PE. \n\nSometimes a company will have a PE ratio that simply seems too high and this can be attributed to the fact that the market decides what it should be. Increased demand results in increased prices and this is true for stocks as well. Netflix has a PE ratio of 266. It's uncertain at this time how the company will live up to such a high premium especially since they are spending increasing amounts on creating original content. However, the fact that this stock just keeps going up  increases the demand for it which sends the share price up which increases demands, so on until something gives. \n\nOf course, sometimes, a low PE is just that; an indication that the company is undervalued. \n\nIn short, a PE ratio is a nuanced thing. It is an important piece of the puzzle for understanding an investment but alone it is not enough. Look at the company's other numbers and business prospects to determine if a PE is too high or low.

All credit to u/ffn:\n\n>In a normal IPO, an underwriter will help the company go public. Part of the underwriter's job is to go around drumming up interest in the company (not really a problem for a big name like Spotify), but another part of their job is to come up with a valuation of the company, gauging interest from potential buyers, and setting both an initial price and the number of shares to go into the market when the company goes public. By doing it this way, the underwriter is able to get a somewhat reasonable estimate for the value of the company, which gives the market a starting point for trading, although there is a significant \"pop\" associated with most IPOs (this is a whole other can of worms, but the popular opinion is that it is in everybody's best interest for the underwriter to underprice the IPO a little bit). The underwriter will often also commit to help support the trading, potentially buying a set number of shares to support the price. For all of these services, the underwriter earns a pretty handsome fee.\n\n>Spotify isn't doing any of that. In order to cut out the underwriting fees, they're just flipping a switch where one day, you're a private shareholder of Spotify, and the open of the next day, your private shares are now publicly traded.\n\n>The market will be 100% responsible for determining how much the company is worth, and private shareholders have full discretion as to how many shares they want to sell into the market, if they want to at all.\n\n>It's possible that not very many shareholders sell into the market, creating a huge supply shortage and causing the stock price to go sky high. It's also possible that a ton of shareholders sell on the first day, flooding the market with shares, and causing the stock price to plummet.
