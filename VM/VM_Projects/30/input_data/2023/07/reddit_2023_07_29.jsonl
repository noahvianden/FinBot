{"title": "programmable system to trade options(all failed ideas)", "selftext": "I am a 48 years old programmer, I have been learning and buying options and stocks. most options are OTM calls, as I learned the non-linear payoff is the key for retailer. I am trying to establish a programmable system to trade options so that I can live on the cash I have . I have tested out IBKR api to monitor data and send orders.\n\n&#x200B;\n\ngiven the maturity of the market, I am going through lots of ideas. I have not found one that seems to convince me it will work. as I am full believer of Taleb philosophy, We can only falsify and proof by negate, if there is such idea that can succeed, more than likely I have not tried hard enough to falsify it.\n\nI hope to gain some idea from you guys. I am not selling volatility ever.\n\n1. volatility surface calibration, get tick price from IBKR, based on bid size and ask size, to get reasonable price and using STI model to calibrate volatility surface. then buy options with low volatility. reason fail, volatility of underlying may change rapidly and also some major event may be in the near future, not sure why the academic is obsessed with volatility surface calibration. do you see a way to success? last price of option may not be accurate, give the size of trade, and also MM may be overrun by insiders.\n2. I see lots of trade flow monitor site, I believe institutional traders can use program to divide large block into small size. or insider( some executive from biotech company) may place large size bet on options, but is this going to be reliable? some site even promote large block size on AAPL,  AAPL is so liquid that I don't think anyone has any insider information, within last 5 years, AAPL has never made some jumps based on nonpublic information, and they may using calls as a hedge.  so this flow alone can not be reliable.\n3. one more thing to try based on 1 and 2, detect large size trade with higher volatility trade , then buying other further out calls with lower strike.\n4. maintain a book , with options and stocks, calculate all the greeks, based on volatility surface calibration, not based simply on BS formula. I see Taleb book on dynamic hedging, it involves 7th derivatives, I think that can only be calculated using real data. using programming skills, it is easy to see it is delta neutral, maybe 2nd  or 3rd derivative neutral, maybe this is why the volatility surface is so important, given current surface, the risk of the portfolio is know more  accurately.\n5. another way is to play the distribution, i.e, extrapolate the prob. dist. of underlying over 2sd, and using power law to calibrate prob. out of 2 sd, then recalculate option price. one to see it is to use the DTE as one unit of time, say you have 300 day dte, just treat that as one unit of time and estimate the prob. of change of underlying to fit the option price, with computer age, with a prob. dist. of different unit time, option price is easy to calc.\n6. market dynamics is not something we play as retailer, and I don't want to speculate, like NVDA gained 25% post earning.\n\nI understand building such a system without any speculation view of the market is extremely hard for retailer,   the process of thinking about and falsifying ideas has somehow made me better understand market risks.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "15cv8df", "created_utc": 1690644971.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 39, "comments": [{"body": "I would love to meet someone online who makes money out of this quant-level talk.i have yet to see anyone give a simple example of a real trade (in retrospect) where they used 2nd level derivatives or Taleb level knowledge to make a profitable trade.\n\nIf i can be so bold - a lot of quant-talk regarding options is simply intellectual masterbation.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "I am online and I post my weekly balance on Twitter, with over 50% ytd, mostly from trading SPX vol and skew.
