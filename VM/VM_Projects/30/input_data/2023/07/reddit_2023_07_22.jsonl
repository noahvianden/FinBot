You could have bought back your premium and held the stock. I suggest you educate yourself and maybe this strategy you are using doesn’t fit your needs.

But you would be back after a couple days like Thursday and Friday saying “ my shares lost 30%, I should have done this and the second”. You’re employing a strategy that is for the most part “safe” from major capital loss, big gains take some level of risk. It is your job to assess what level or risk you can handle and in turn because you have chosen that level of risk you accept the gains or losses associated. I sell covered calls against my shares, each time I do that I assess the possibility that I may get my shares called away, I don’t complain when that happens (it does periodically) as there are days when the stock drops significantly and I get 70% gain on my premium.  Stop whining that you missed out and evaluate your actual strategy and what you are trying to accomplish, if you have small levels of capital wheeling helps with smaller gains (think slow and steady wins the race) if you have a heavy level of capital there are other strategies you can use for larger gains.
