I was one of the naysayers who felt SBUX getting to 95 (5 Delta at the time) in 3 weeks was dubious. The stock was going to have to undo an earnings gap up (i.e. positive market sentiment), fall below 3 major SMAs (200, 100, 50), and fall ~7% in 3 weeks to get to 95. By, golly, it did that and at a fast(er) clip!\n\nWhat wasn't clear at the time was that the SBUX story was getting increasingly murky on the international stage. That selloff has been steady and relentless. Certainty didn't intend to lead you astray -- just to provide feedback based on technicals and best known info at the time in a world where chart/stock analysis is not fortune telling or reading tea leaves or any sort of exact science. \n\nThe 12/15 SBUX 95 puts are currently priced at ~ 1.05-1.14, as of COB on 12/5. Subtract the cost that you previewed earlier (14 cents or so), and that's roughly what your current potential profit per contract would look like. From there, you'd have to decide whether to sell to close now for profit (the most straightforward choice) or let it ride out longer (on hopes of increased gains, but with downside risks). Another middle-ground choice (not for beginners) would have been to sell a further OTM put(s) against it, thus creating a vertical spread(s).

Impressive rally by SBUX today. Even with a tough day for the markets, it beelined upward to $97+. Looks like it ultimately wanted no part of being a sub-$95 stock.\n\nYou exhibited good insights in picking SBUX to short. Kudos. I didn't explicitly point that out earlier. However, a deep OTM short put at 5 Delta with three weeks 'til expiration was not the ideal way to express that bearish thesis. A deep OTM put was always more of a low probability/ low risk/ high reward 'lotto'  than a tried and true, genuinely promising way of trading. A key takeaway that I'd want to impart to you would be for you to not run into the rabbit hole of thinking that because the long odds OTM play would have worked out this time around that equates to good trading. One could go broke chasing that kind of \"success\".\n\nThe reality is that the OTM 95 strike puts were priced at $.14 cents with three weeks left until expiration with the expectation that they would in the highest of all likelihoods continue to retain little value and ultimately end up expiring worthless. \n\nAn ITM put (e.g. 7 Delta) two or more weeks until expiration or an the money put debit spread would have been more promising.
