{"title": "Has Alphabet Lost Its Edge?", "selftext": "TL;DR: Until we can try out Gemini Ultra, it's at least questionable to what extent Alphabet's new AI is really superior to GPT 4. Microsoft also provides an ecosystem into which OpenAI's GPTs fit seamlessly. Where does that leave Alphabet if Gemini Ultra doesn't deliver on all its promises? - Google Search, and here again, Microsoft's Bing is catching up, using the power of OpenAI.\n\nThis is not financial advice.\n\nThe full text can be found [here](https://medium.com/@chaotropy/g%C3%B6tterd%C3%A4mmerung-has-alphabet-lost-its-edge-b3d78efe3a9c) or [here](https://www.chaotropy.com/gotterdammerung-has-alphabet-lost-its-edge/).\n\n\"\\[...\\]Last week Alphabet announced its new AI Gemini, which will be released in 3 different versions: Nano, Pro and Ultra. According to Google Deepmind’s recent report, Gemini Ultra outperforms OpenAI’s GPT 4 in almost all benchmarks. This claim was supported by a video that turned out to be staged (I wouldn’t call it a fake, as the [real prompts were also published](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/12/how-its-made-gemini-multimodal-prompting.html)). But if Gemini Ultra is finally superior to GPT 4 and this can be proven by many benchmarks, why does Alphabet continue to hide its prodigy? Why does Alphabet take the risk that OpenAI will release GPT 4.5 in the near future and thus sweep away all the doubts about its superiority?\n\nHasn’t Alphabet’s innovation lead always been a big part of the investment thesis for Alphabet shareholders? Now Alphabet is trying hard to show that its secret AI, Gemini Ultra, can keep up with the already publicly available GPT 4 — marketing aside, the published report on Gemini Ultra doesn’t say much more than that. An AI is not a gasoline engine. You cannot simply quantify its performance on a scale and then claim that a single-digit percentage difference is evidence of one’s superiority over the other. I am not an expert in quantitative evaluation of AI, but ultimately AI is statistical learning, and in my experience the new generative language models do not always produce reproducible results (especially when generating images). Accordingly, shouldn’t the significance level of the measured performance differences be specified? Couldn’t these rather small differences just be statistical noise in favor of Gemini? Also, the results given are not reproducible because we cannot test Gemini Ultra. And again, if Gemini Ultra is so superior, why can’t we just try it? So has Alphabet lost its edge? I don’t know, but with every statement without a tangible product, my doubts about the company’s superiority grow.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the giant behind [OpenAI with a 49% stake: Microsoft](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/30/microsoft-join-openai-board-altman), which has a product ecosystem that literally screams for AI implementations. And I’m not just talking about Word, which will soon be writing for us, PowerPoint, which will magically put together our next presentation, or Excel, which will soon be giving no one a headache: Microsoft Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are widely used integrated development environments (IDEs) and industry standards. Microsoft’s code-generating bot, Github Copilot, has been available as a plug-in since 2021. So if AI is going to have a real impact on business productivity and therefore our economies, it could be through the infrastructure that Microsoft provides. So even if Gemini Ultra beats GPT4 in many ways and OpenAI cannot deliver a better AI in the near future, Microsoft is providing the services where AI could become a real productivity driver.\n\nAnd what will Alphabet have left if it loses this AI battle? People use its cash cow, Google Search, today largely because they’ve been used to it for two decades — that’s worth a lot, but maybe Bing can slay even that metaphorical dragon with the magic of OpenAI, unaware of its often-called unbeatable dominance\\[...\\]\"", "id": "18gwlrv", "created_utc": 1702415716.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.34, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|22|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xyz1pg/why_not_att/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/139oauc/long_axcelis_acls/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/10l6zzl/general_dynamics_has_now_the_opportunity_to/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12vbbyp/my_match_for_2023_really_this_pun/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Until we can try out Gemini Ultra, it's at least questionable to what extent Alphabet's new AI is really superior to GPT 4.
