{"title": "Comcast, Disney move up talks to decide Hulu future ownership from Jan 2024 to Sept 30th", "selftext": "https://deadline.com/2023/09/hulu-disney-comcast-stake-sale-timeline-moved-up-streaming-billion-1235537919/\n\nComcast and Disney have modified their Hulu agreement to enable the expected buyout of Comcast’s one-third stake in the streamer to begin on September 30 instead of next January. The news was shared at a Goldman Sachs conference appearance by Comcast CEO Brian Roberts, who said the initial minimum valuation of $27.5 billion for Hulu agreed to in 2019 was “just a hypothetical.” He suggested the final price tag could be much higher. Roberts said both companies “wanted to get this behind us,” so they reached an agreement last week to accelerate the timeline.\n\nOn September 30, Disney can “put” and Comcast can “call,” which starts the process of the one-third stake moving to Disney. Each company will have its own appraiser and then there will be third-party appraisers, so the process could take some time. Roberts said both companies “are well-served to have clarity for investors about what this really means,” so it shouldn’t drag on too long. The put/call provision was part of the 2019 operational takeover of Hulu by Disney in 2019 in the wake of the $71.3 billion acquisition of most of 21st Century Fox. Founded in 2007, Hulu was always a joint venture, in its later years among Fox, Disney and Comcast/NBCUniversal. While Disney and Comcast have publicly floated the scenario of Comcast buying out Disney’s share, the process has followed the more widely expected path of Disney rolling up full control.\n\nRoberts emphasized that the $27.5 billion minimum valuation “that people have bandied about was just a hypothetical” and will likely to end up far higher. Hulu is “a scarce, kingmaker asset,” he asserted, and worth “way more today than it was” when the parties agreed to the five-year timeline. “Netflix and Hulu are in a class by themselves” as stand-alone streaming outlets, Roberts said. Citing Nielsen data, he said engagement on Hulu is “two to three times” that of rival streamers except for Netflix.", "id": "16bnk4e", "created_utc": 1694014913.0, "score": 71, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "i honestly prefer hulu to the other streaming services.

{"title": "How is it possible that Tesla only won 18% of the bids for the federal charger subsidies if they build them faster and 20 to 70% cheaper?", "selftext": "Quote by Teslarati:\n\n>As noted by the WSJ, Tesla is installing its Superchargers faster than its rivals, and the company is accomplishing it at a cost that’s 20% to 70% lower.  \n>  \n>The electric vehicle maker has won bids to build out chargers at about 18% of the sites elected by US states using federal dollars. That’s more than any other company, as noted by EV charging analytics firm EVAdoption. Roughly $77 million have reportedly been granted so far, and Tesla has won $8.5 million of the number.\n\nIt's quite an intriguing conundrum, isn't it? Tesla's remarkable efficiency and cost-effectiveness in Supercharger installations are well-documented. But what leaves me scratching my head is the fact that despite their evident prowess in this domain, they've secured only 18% of the bids for federal charger subsidies. This discrepancy warrants a deeper dive into the situation.\n\nTesla's impressive track record, as highlighted in The WSJ, shows that they are deploying Superchargers at a pace that outstrips their competitors. Not only are they faster, but they also manage to do so with a significantly reduced cost burden, somewhere between 20% to 70% lower than their rivals. This raises the question: If they're this efficient, why aren't they winning a more substantial share of the bids?\n\nAccording to data from EVAdoption, Tesla's success in securing these bids surpasses that of any other company in the electric vehicle industry. Out of roughly $77 million in subsidies granted so far, Tesla has managed to secure $8.5 million. While this is certainly a significant amount, it still leaves a substantial portion of the funds unaccounted for, and it's causing some Tesla enthusiasts to question the situation.\n\nOne speculation that has emerged in the Tesla community is the possibility of corruption or favoritism at play, which may explain the discrepancy. However, this is merely conjecture at this point, and we need more information to draw any concrete conclusions.\n\nSo, let's open the floor for discussion. What could be the factors contributing to Tesla's limited success in winning federal charger subsidy bids? Are there regulatory hurdles, competitive dynamics, or other hidden factors that we should consider? Your insights and information could help shed light on this puzzling scenario and provide a clearer picture of the electric vehicle charging landscape.", "id": "16bwznl", "created_utc": 1694036405.0, "score": 86, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 45, "comments": [{"body": "Without knowing how many sites they bid on, there is no point in speculation.

Forth they’ve won the most of any company so it’s not a conspiracy.\n\nAlso, EDIT: everyone should know this NEVI money is decided on by each individual state. The Feds don’t choose. And again, the total amount at play here is $4.5B [LINK SOURCE](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/evs_5year_nevi_funding_by_state.cfm). \n\nTL, DR: Tesla is doing great, winning a bunch of NEVI money they don’t even need among th SMALL POT OF CURRENT AWARDS, representing less than a 1% of the total program.
