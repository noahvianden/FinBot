{"title": "Walmart easily beats expectations for holiday-quarter sales and earnings", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/walmart-wmt-earnings-q4-2023.html\n\nWalmart on Tuesday topped holiday-quarter earnings expectations, as the discounter said it drew budget-conscious shoppers searching for food, gifts and household items at a lower price.\n\nHere’s what the company reported for the fiscal fourth quarter that ended Jan. 31, according to Refinitiv consensus estimates:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.71, adjusted vs. $1.51 expected\n\nRevenue: $164.05 billion vs. $159.72 billion expected\n\nThe big-box retailer said it expects same-store sales for Walmart U.S. to rise by between 2% and 2.5% excluding fuel, in the fiscal year ahead. It said it expects adjusted earnings per share to range from $5.90 to $6.05, excluding fuel.\n\nIn a call with CNBC, Walmart’s CFO John David Rainey said grocery prices still remain elevated, which is causing shoppers to buy fewer discretionary items.\n\n“The consumer is still very pressured,” he said. “And if you look at economic indicators, balance sheets are running thinner and savings rates are declining relative to previous periods. And so that’s why we take a pretty cautious outlook on the rest of the year.”\n\nWalmart reported a net income of $ 6.28 billion, or $2.32, up from $3.56 billion, or $1.28, a year earlier. \n\nSame-store sales for Walmart U.S. rose 8.3%, excluding fuel. The key industry metric that includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year. E-commerce sales jumped by 17% year over year for Walmart U.S.\n\nThe company is not only the nation’s largest retailer. It’s also a grocery powerhouse, a factor that has steadied sales and driven foot traffic as Americans watch the budget because of high inflation. \n\nWalmart’s reputation for value has helped the retailer – as has its large grocery business. It is the largest grocer in the country by revenue. \n\nAt Sam’s Club, same-store sales rose 12.2%, excluding fuel.\n\nThe company’s e-commerce sales in the U.S. increased/decreased TK% compared with the year-ago quarter. \n\nShares of Walmart closed on Friday at $146.44, bringing the company’s market cap to nearly $395 billion. The company’s shares are up about 3% so far this year, underperforming the S&P 500′s approximately 6% gain during the same period.", "id": "1181x41", "created_utc": 1676981211.0, "score": 77, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 105, "replies": [{"body": "I don't know if this is the case here, but finance media often change the headlines after the market opens to reflect the stock's moves.

Historically, the stock market has tended to be a leading economic indicator, meaning that it often begins to recover before the broader economy does. In fact, some of the strongest stock market gains have occurred during the early stages of economic recovery following a recession.\n\n> This phenomenon is partly due to the fact that investors often anticipate an economic recovery well before it actually occurs. When there are signs of economic improvement, such as rising corporate profits, declining unemployment, or increased consumer spending, investors may become more optimistic about the future prospects of businesses and the stock market.\n\n> It's worth noting, however, that the stock market can also experience short-term volatility and declines during a recession, as well as during the recovery period. Recessions can be unpredictable, and the length and severity of a recession can vary depending on a wide range of economic factors.

{"title": "Beary impressive… 2-21-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "After a pretty impressive support bounce on Friday… I am very impressed to see that the bears came out swinging with a -1% red open and even temporarily hit -2% today. Honestly after pretty much two months of buy the dip… I have to 100% hand it to the bears for the work they put in today. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cilk8xso1mja1.png?width=788&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6f49993e8b51e9980d2899178bc23ed863902e4\n\nPretty interesting data here showing how strong of bear day we had today. The bulls actually closed out a -2% day… hella impressive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hw0gbh6p1mja1.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=9447b64c0fc958b15db63442e083128ad21194fd\n\nTomorrow for those of you who don’t know is FOMC minutes at 2pm… JPOW will NOT be speaking.. its just a release of what was said essentially at the last meeting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/30zmulrp1mja1.png?width=808&format=png&auto=webp&s=3028189f7edd656d52237a2f1404fe148f72d290\n\nTaking a look at SPY daily here we actually are looking at a really impressive down trend over the last 3 days now. Now this blue resistance line sits at 400.2 for tomorrow which means bears got about $1 of upside to still hold same down trend. This also is the first time spy has closed 3 red days in a row since January which funny enough was right after CPI… Actually what truly is crazy is that the trend from last CPI to this CPI is identical. The bears impressively enough were able to close us back under the daily 200ema also today. \n\nWe had a doji CPI day -> small \\~0.3% green day -> then 3 red days in a row. \n\nIf trend follows then SPY could be in for a massive green day tomorrow…\n\nWe have to factor in FOMC minutes… now that a 50bps hike is on the table (last I checked was about 20% priced in), with CPI and PPI data coming in hotter than expected and PMI this morning coming in bearish… we very well could see a negative reaction to FOMC minutes. However, much like most FOMC days the reaction to FOMC minutes generally speaking is bullish. \n\nFor me looking at the daily here now that we have lost 405.3 and closed under it I am bearish back to 390. There is always a chance we get a retest of 405.3 resistance first however, losing 405.3 should open up a retest of 390 support. 390 is a major pivot point in this market and depending on our timing reaching it and the next CPI/ FOMC could start a catalyst for further downside or for a recover back to the 400s. \n\nKey SPY Support- 399.1 -> 396.6 -> 395.9 -> 393.6\n\nKey SPY Resistance- 401 -> 403.2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r37zatiq1mja1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=05ebada88c840f662e78a5c8fe78826df63680c2\n\nFutures actually has a similar looking pattern with a closure under the daily 200ema and this bigger falling wedge pattern you see highlighted in blue. \n\nWith a confirmed rejection of the daily 20ema without ever looking back and presumably the daily 8ema crossing under the daily 20ema tomorrow this is setting up for a bigger bearish drop. \n\nBears have upside to 4045 to still holding falling wedge resistance tomorrow. And the falling wedge support will sit at 3990 tomorrow. \n\nMajor downside target would be 3920 support area (similar to that 390 SPY level) if we continue downside. \n\nKey Futures Support- 4010 -> 3985 -> 3965\n\nKey Futures Resistance- 4032 -> 4055\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/00nhjt6u1mja1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3034d90a54fec82d04f494b034d374bee52f279\n\nTaking a look at tesla here (and honestly this goes for the majority of Semis/ tech right now) we are seeing a clear rejection and breakout. \n\nFor Tesla specifically we rejected the daily 200ema last week 3 separate times and despite its best efforts Friday and today was not able to get back there. With Thursday bouncing off the daily 8ema support, Friday closing over daily 8ema and now tesla closing back under daily 8ema support today we should naturally look for a bigger sell off to the daily 20ema. \n\nThere is a bigger breakout triangle formed here on Tesla also. The daily bull channel has been broken as of last week so now our most viable pattern is this break out triangle. Support sits at 197 support tomorrow and resistance at 205. Essentially if Tesla opens or pushes red at all tomorrow we will confirm this breakout/ down triangle pattern and that will lead to further downside. However, if it manages to find support tomorrow and retakes 205 this could be a fake breakdown before a breakout back to that daily 200ema at 215. \n\nKey Tesla Support- 197 -> 191.9 -> 183.7 -> 181.5  \n Key Tesla Resistance- 205 -> 214.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9li70igv1mja1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8b2b4a75ea1389173f18b077f10608294d58e91\n\nTaking a look at the VIX here we had that massive breakout of its breakout triangle… with a breakout here and a break down on SPY that could be further confirmation of more downside to come on SPY/ VIX. \n\nOddly enough we are nearing that key pivot level on the VIX of 23.6. This is like the soft danger zone… when and if the vix crosses and holds over that level then we will see further downside on SPY and the market as a whole. \n\nAfter seeing the VIX relatively flat for the last basically 2 months straight the VIX has had an incredible 28.2% rally from Thursdays low to today HOD. 28.2% in 3 days is pretty incredible. And honestly its more incredible that SPY has only put in one -2% day during that whole time period. \n\nActually its pretty incredible that through all of last week with CPI, and PPI that we on a random Tuesday get a -1% red day and the biggest/ worst red day of the year yet… seems a little interesting to me. \n\n**Daily log-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9sxagd0w1mja1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=abd2a42b01835a3599385d54fb0521e0a8672cb1\n\nI swang futures calls this weekend and honestly I never looking at the VIX and spy on Friday would have suspected that we would close a -2% red day… at all. I would take that swing again and again. However, futures showed quite a bit of weakness throughout the weekend but oddly everytime it was looking ready to breakout it just kept getting slapped down over the holiday trading hours. But open it was so far gone that I was hoping for a small relief rally at open to mitigate some loss but PMI took us straight down and it was all over from there. \n\nAfter that honestly intraday trading today was not that bad. However, I would have been better off if I stopped trading at 12pm after my 6 wins a row (had a nice intraday streak of 14 wins in a row going). However, that 1245am reversal I had entered a put and fully expected a relief rally up to the 15min 20ema so mitigated my loss (so I thought) I then bit the call bullet thinking when we closed over 8ema that we would continue to breakout, however, we immediately double topped and I shoulda just stuck to my original thesis. \n\nLooking back I should have trusted VOLD more during that time period and while I was fighting trend slightly a relief rally is expected most days to the 20ema and the fact that we didn’t get that actually is even more impressive of a red day today. \n\nOverall not a bad day IV was also elevated today because of FOMC minutes tomorrow which did make the payout for options less than desirable after the bigger morning pushes.", "id": "118fqud", "created_utc": 1677015274.0, "score": 111, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|4284|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1144ms6/50_bps_hike_the_nail_in_the_bear_coffin_21623_spy/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: Bulls closed a -2% red day… impressive.
