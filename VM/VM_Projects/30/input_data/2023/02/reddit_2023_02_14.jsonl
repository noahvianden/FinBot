{"title": "Fed Lorie Logan: “Supply chains can’t recover twice, so I don’t see 3% deflation in core goods as sustainable.”", "selftext": "Fed Logan's giving a speech on inflation today. Below are my notes for the speech. The inflation number likely doesn't include today's CPI.\n\n[https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/logan/2023/lkl230214](https://www.dallasfed.org/news/speeches/logan/2023/lkl230214)\n\nThis is a very good breakdown of how the Fed views inflation, and how they factor it into their rate hike decision going forward. I'd highly encourage people to read this if you need a primer on the current outlook for inflation.\n\nI've highlighted notable quotes below. She also talked about financial condition, and the market's still trying to analyze what financial condition metrics the Fed monitors. This is because of Powell's comments of \"financial conditions have been steady\" when most financial condition metrics by the market show considerable loosening.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, there has been some progress on inflation in recent months. But the question for monetary policy is not whether there has been some progress, but rather **whether the progress will continue**. **Will inflation return all the way to our 2 percent target, and will it sustainably remain there over time**?\n\nfor the last three months of 2022, **headline PCE inflation slowed to an annualized rate of 2.1 percent**. However, **a good bit of that drop in inflation was due to falling prices of oil and other commodities**. **Energy prices**, as measured by the PCE price index for energy goods and services, **fell at a 16 percent annual rate over the last three months of 2022**. But while it’s a relief to see lower prices at the gas pump, **energy prices can’t keep falling at this rate forever.**\n\n**Core inflation**, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, has **historically been a better guide to where overall inflation will go in the future**. And core PCE inflation was nearly 3 percent annualized for the last three months of 2022, which is significantly higher than the inflation rate the public is counting on us to deliver. \"\n\n**we can break down core inflation into a few more pieces**: core goods, which includes items like cars and clothing; housing services, such as rent; and core services excluding housing. **This last category makes up about half of personal consumption** and includes everything from health care to transportation to entertainment.\n\n**Core goods prices fell at a 3 percent annual rate in the last three months of 2022, partially offsetting rapid increases in services prices**. Goods prices dropped in part because supply chains were recovering from the disruptions of the pandemic. Supply chains can’t recover twice, so **I don’t see 3 percent deflation in core goods as sustainable**. It seems more likely that core goods inflation will move up to the prepandemic trend of zero or a bit below, which means we’ll need lower services inflation to sustain 2 percent inflation overall.\n\nBecause rents adjust infrequently as leases turn over, i**t takes time for a cooler housing market to translate into lower measures of housing inflation**. Housing inflation was still around 9 percent annualized for the last three months of 2022. But our research at the Dallas Fed suggests that housing inflation should peak later this year.\n\nThe larger concern is with services other than housing. **Core services inflation excluding housing has been running in a range of 4 to 5 percent for close to two years, with little sign of improvement**. You could say this is the core of the inflation problem.\n\n**If core services inflation excluding housing remained in its current range**, while other categories returned to their prepandemic pace, **total inflation going forward would settle much closer to 3 percent** than to our 2 percent goal. And **depending on how the U.S. and world economies evolve, inflation could be even higher**. For example, the Dallas Fed’s business contacts tell us that **China’s rapid transition out of zero-COVID policies could drive up commodity prices this year** by more than what most people currently expect.\n\nBut in addition, because **services prices depend substantially on labor costs**, the outlook for sustainably **returning inflation to 2 percent hinges in large part on what happens in the labor market.**\n\non average over the past half-year, the **economy has added 350,000 jobs a month, which is still very high**.\n\nAnother sign of strength in the labor market is that as of December, t**here were 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person** in the United States. That is **down only slightly from the all-time high of two openings per unemployed person** last March. And it is **well above the ratio of 1.2 openings per unemployed person in 2019—which was thought at the time to be a very strong labor market.**\n\nstrong labor market has been driving up **wages, which have been growing at an annual rate of about 4.5 to 5 percent** by a variety of measures.\n\nOver time, to be **able to buy more goods and services with their wages,** workers taken together must produce more goods and services. In other words, **labor productivity must rise**.\n\nIn the long run, **if companies’ profit margins**—or, more precisely, capital’s share of income—are **stable, the growth rate of prices will equal the growth rate of wages minus the growth rate of labor productivity.**\n\nFalling profit margins could also conceivably contribute to lower inflation in the short run.\n\nBut for **5 percent wage growth to be consistent with 2 percent inflation** on a sustained basis, **productivity would have to rise at a 3 percent annual rate. Yet output per hour worked grew at an annual rate of only 1 and a quarter percent from 2012 through 2019, and there is little indication it has accelerated meaningfully since then**.\n\nAbsent a dramatic rise in productivity, it seems likely that sustainably returning inflation to 2 percent will require substantially lower wage growth. That may take time. Respondents to the **Dallas Fed’s Texas Business Outlook Surveys expect more than 5 percent wage growth in 2023,** which is down significantly from what they saw in 2022 but still quite elevated. Wage pressures have moderated somewhat in the latest national reports on average hourly earnings and employment costs\n\n**To achieve better balance, labor supply will have to increase, or labor demand will have to decrease**\n\nLabor supply has been weak coming out of the pandemic. **Early retirements, deaths and lingering illness from the pandemic have reduced the supply of workers**. So have structural challenges like the l**ack of child care for working parents**. And **immigration fell to nearly zero during the pandemic, though it has since bounced back sharply**. Beyond that, employers tell me that when workers are available, they often **lack the necessary training or skills**.\n\nBoth of these tools **push up interest rates for consumers and companies** throughout the economy. Financial conditions have, therefore, tightened significantly. The 10-year nominal **Treasury yield has risen about 2 percentage points, and mortgage rates have risen nearly 3 percentage points**, since the start of 2022. Importantly, in recent months, **real medium-term interest rates as measured by the yields on Treasury Inflation Protected Securities have averaged above 1.5 percent. That is a significantly restrictive level given that most estimates suggest the neutral real interest rate is below 1 percent**\n\nThe **most important risk I see is that if we tighten too little, the economy will remain overheated and we will fail to keep inflation in check**. That could trigger a self-fulfilling spiral of unanchored inflation expectations that would be very costly to stop.\n\nwhen **central banks aren’t sufficiently proactive in addressing high inflation**, the **road back to price stability is longer, the labor market is weaker, and the scars on the economy can last long after inflation is finally reduced**. We must stay focused on bringing inflation back to target in a sustainable and timely way\n\nAt the same time, if **we tighten too much or too fast, we risk seeing the labor market weaken much more than is necessary to control inflation.** Those job losses would be very costly, too, particularly for lower-income households.\n\n**we shouldn’t lock in on a peak interest rate or a precise path of rates**\n\nThe **evidence I’m looking for to gain confidence in the inflation outlook** includes some **further and sustained improvement in the inflation statistics**, as well as a clear change in the underlying factors—like the **imbalance of aggregate supply and demand and resulting very tight labor market**—that have been producing high inflation. And I think we need to see the **economy evolving more or less as forecasts predict. When inflation repeatedly comes in higher than the forecasts, as it did last year, or when the jobs report comes in with hundreds of thousands more jobs than anyone expected, as happened a couple weeks ago, it is hard to have confidence in any outlook**.\n\nI will also remain attentive to financial conditions. Ultimately, **financial conditions need to be sufficiently restrictive to restore price stability**. We must remain **prepared to continue rate increases for a longer period than previously anticipated, if such a path is necessary to respond to changes in the economic outlook or to offset any undesired easing in conditions**. And **even after we have enough evidence that we don’t need to raise rates at some future meeting, we’ll need to remain flexible and tighten further if changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions call for it.**", "id": "1129an6", "created_utc": 1676391481.0, "score": 115, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "That was an excellent speech.

It's very hard for him to say a lot without conflicting with the hawk or dove group.   This is slightly different from his personal interviews, where he doesn't have to worry about representing the whole committee as much, and can give more of his personal opinions. Also, every little thing he does is overanalyzed. We have people thinking he's bullish because he seemed more relaxed in his interview question. We have an SP500 that goes up 1% just because he uses the word disinflation, without caring about the context. We have a market that assumes he's bullish because he said financial conditions have stayed relatively the same since December, without caring about how the Fed defines \"financial condition\".\n\nPowell also has a tough task. He has to signal, or drop hints, that the Fed is slowing the pace of rate hike (and other tasks that are explicitly dovish), without directly saying so, and still remain hawkish.

Sorry I've been busy trying to gather more data and making some sort of real time inflation predictor, so I was mainly focusing on predicting each component more accurately.\n\nSome interesting issues this month for inflation:\n\n1. Concensus is +0.6% or so NSA MoM. Prelim looks like +0.6% to +0.7%. Downside surprise is possible due to point (5) on Medicare payments -2%.\n2. BLS uses new weights for 2023 using 2021 weights. Used cars less. New cars more. Medical services less. Food a bit more. Housing especially lodging much more. Energy less.\n3. Manheim Used Cars +2% MoM you might have heard. Manheim has a 2 month lag. We shall see a +2% MoM in April ish.\n4. Cars still -0.6%, albeit somewhat less, but will be weighted less.\n5. Medicare schedules for physicians are -2% or this January since Congress removed the COVID payment raise. Depending on if doctors will pass this savings immediately remains to be seen.\n6. Insulin down due to IRA. Not too much of an impact though, but still minuses inflation.\n7. Hospital Services +2% or so, which partially offsets Physician Services.\n8. Motor Fuel / Gas Prices might be up +2.51% in Jan, but Natural Gas is down -2.49% and Electricity down -0.06%. Contrary to popular belief, I believe energy is only up +0.75%.\n9. Housing OER +0.66%. Primary Rent +0.8%. Lodging Away from Home seasonality seems to be +3%, which pushes housing +0.7% ish.\n10. Food small +0.15%, mainly due to food from home decreasing tinily. Food Away From Home increases a lot, which can have upside momentum to other services.\n11. Apparel / Clothing up +1%, and most goods up.\n12. Health Insurance less weight but still -4% MoM.\n\nIn general, I'm expecting somewhat hotter 6.2 to 6.3%, but not much.\n\nHousing might roll over, which might push inflation within expectations.\n\nMedicare is a wildcard this time round.
