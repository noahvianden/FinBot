There's a reason they've taken a nose dive lately, they're literally about to be bankrupt.  Maybe acquisition is in the books but more likely they'll need to file for Ch. 11 and re-organize their assets.\n\nThe only turnaround I see is if they get short squeezed.  No way this is a long term profitable business.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "I keep looking at them thinking, there's gotta be some value here with such a ridiculous P/S ratio.

At a certain point I always think, how in the world are they still in business?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly what I ask, how in the world is their clown of a management company in business, but I feel there is value for individuals based on the information I've researched.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Debt market is heavily pricing in bankruptcy... haven't been able to issue debt and none of the credit players are lending them anything under 25% if they can get 15% from PE portcos right now.

They were terrible investments prior to meming.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "And both companies are still long term unprofitable and only afloat because they managed to issue new shares to bag holders.  Look at BBBYQ... I'm not saying they won't run - I'm just saying they're not a long term hold and the person writing the DD should be aware of that.\n\nIf their position and diligence was centered around short % of float and indicators that the stock was about to run to get shorts to cover then that would be different but they're comparing RAD to Walgreens and other pharmacies that aren't in trouble of liquidation.\n\nThat being said if you read my above post I'm actually considering buying short term (40 DTE) call options and longer term (360 DTE) puts.  I'll do more research tomorrow.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "And I have warning on this stock as anyone should, no one should bet or do anything they are not comfortable doing.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Hopefully they get their act together.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "This is a pump and dump as usual.

The retail store side of this business is horrible, but CVS at least is diversifying into numerous markets (insurance, pharmacy benefits manager, primary care).
