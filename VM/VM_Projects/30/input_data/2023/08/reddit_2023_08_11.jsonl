Someone who can invest $5k a year could add 20% to that by cutting out the coffee spending as an example. However, not drinking coffee isn’t going to make you wealthy. The theme is right though, cutting out frivolous spending is a key contributor to building wealth over time. \n\nYounger professionals making good money anecdotally spend more than they should on eating out, drinking at expensive places, food delivery, and stimulants, all things that aren’t really necessary and can be easily substituted. Many of these people in my circle earn 6-figures, and have high career trajectories, but are materially impacting their long term wealth due to unnecessary spending habits. I think a lot of younger people are unfairly assigning blame for their lack of wealth and assets on external factors while not taking any accountability for things they can control. Not to say those grievances like high housing cost, inflation, etc aren’t true, but it doesn’t mean you can’t better position yourself and do something about it.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "What is the argument?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "One's life will be more enjoyable if they have an emergency savings account, do not have debt, are contributing to a retirement account, and can go to the grocery store without checking their account balance first.\n\nAchieve that, then buy all the lattes you want.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "... what can you afford?\n\nIf you prioritize your savings as a percentage of your income, why shouldn't you have a latte a day if your budget allows for you?", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Financial advice has never been to penny-pinch though.

Everything flows from this basic idea.\n\nIf coffee is your favorite thing in the world and you get a special cup every day, and that's worth $1500 a year to you, then do it. If you didn't realize how much money you were spending on random coffees, you could probably go without them. But you should still budget and only do that if you can afford it. That means you might need to cut something else, like a vacation, out of your budget if you really love coffee that much.
