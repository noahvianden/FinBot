(Removal from Schedule 1 drug list)**\n\n**Next step is NYSE / NASDAQ uplisting and BIG TABACO / BIG ALCOHOL / BIG PHARAMA about to buy or partner with Cannabis companies.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7tlw7bi6calb1.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d6953c06c0fdccf555fdd9fb00b4a9c31e55a17\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95eyklr7calb1.png?width=757&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc19e596ecd3bdc9540daf2565a2062b4c486eb1\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xu627sfcdalb1.png?width=738&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d5357965249fd615d30fccad6b4d55fc45f4f2a\n\n[This is just the beginning. Buy January 2024 or January 2025 leaps on $MSOS USA Cannabis ETF.](https://preview.redd.it/b1567lqaealb1.png?width=537&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7363c015194a18242a55c84d7be643b45bc562a)\n\n**How to play the USA Cannabis sector: Buy $MSOS (USA Cannabis ETF)** ðŸš€ ðŸŒ•\n\nYou can buy NASDAQ listed Canadian stocks like $TLRY who have a path to the USA, but for a true proxy play to the USA Cannabis sector, buy companies such as **$CURLF (Curaleaf)**, **$TCNNF** (**Trulieve)** and **$GTBIF** (**Green Thumb Industries).**\n\nHowever, for now, they are OTC tickers and can only be bought if your broker allows you, but you CAN BUY the **$MSOS USA Cannabis ETF** or **$MSOX** (2x bull $MSOS) **which trades on the NYSE** for true USA cannabis exposure as they hold the USA names as swaps.\n\nYou can buy some **$10, $15 or $20 OTM strike $MSOS calls for January 2024/2025** as federal legislation will most likely happen before the end of the year. Cannabis is a popular political issue that the Democrats and even Republicans will run on leading into the November 2024 election cycle.\n\n[BUY $MSOS ETF which trades on the NYSE and holds USA Cannabis Companies Curaleaf, Trulieve, Green Thumbs](https://preview.redd.it/3ki3yq9ccalb1.png?width=685&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b68dfa9965d51b0443b70e6c4f343a2eb1bb944)\n\n[The \\\\\"Big 3\\\\\" USA Cannabis Company CEO's = $CURLF \\(Curaleaf\\) Boris Jordan + $GTBIF \\(Green Thumb Industries\\) Ben Klover + $TCNNF \\(Trulieve\\) Kim Rivers](https://preview.redd.it/jlgmchadcalb1.png?width=1917&format=png&auto=webp&s=a002b955cfcb7184f320baaa86b13b371ed6fbe2)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4eob14wgcalb1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2cff473f50e0126e823fca754f39cce68f49206\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSAFE Banking Act + HHS Biden Administration Rescheduling Cannabis before the end of 2023. Next step to make it official is the DEA.\n\nOnce this happens and **USA Cannabis companies** up-list to the NYSE / NASDAQ + institution money is able to come in and invest, the USA Cannabis stock prices will have a **VIOLENT RE-RATING HIGHER!** ðŸŒ¿ ðŸ“ˆ\n\nLet's see if we get official news over the next few weeks leading into Fall 2023. Cannabis stocks are also seasonally strong during the Fall into March the following year.\n\nTL;DR = The USA Cannabis space is a **GENERATIONAL BUYING OPPORTUNIY** near **all time low** **stock prices** (and are **HIGHLY SHORTED** over the past 5 years) with **multiple catalyst** lined up for Fall 2023! ðŸ¤«\n\nFinal thought = **Joe Biden is sucking so hard in the poll, that they will FOR SURE use Cannabis to try to get votes.** But to do so ahead of the November 2024 elections, the Democrats needs to do something ASAP before they go campaigning. On October 6, 2022 Joe Biden issued an \"expedited order\" and that date is almost 1 year up. After student debt, inflation, housing etc, he needs a win, badly.\n\nAlso don't forget that other **CPG (Consumer Packaged Goods) Companies** are looking at the Cannabis sector too! In **2018 $KO (Coca-Cola)** was in talks with **$ACB (Aurora Cannabis)**. I would imagine that food players like **$PEP (PepsiCo)** and **$MDLZ (Mondelez)** with their **snack portfolio** is looking at a Cannabis partnership deal too! \n\n[ In 2018 $KO \\(Coca-Cola\\) was about to make a deal with $ACB \\(Aurora Cannabis\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/utkzbbtmcalb1.png?width=1072&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ed5497dfcbd2675bfb6f92a102dea002dbb2539)", "id": "165lm87", "created_utc": 1693417854.0, "score": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|405|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pazmes/bb_blackberry_the_sleeping_giant_potential_2/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ptidr0/bb_blackberry_unleash_the_beast_post_earning/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rafgfj/bb_blackberry_is_ready_to_launch_list_of_upcoming/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Buy $MSOS (USA Cannabis ETF) ðŸŒ¿ ðŸ“ˆ", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Only 900% to go before I can drop all my cannabis bags\n\nLFG", "score": 38, "replies": [{"body": "Iâ€™m just letting you know your not aloneâ€¦.", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I missed the days of weed P&Ds\n\nHopefully the bagholders get out this time.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Fuck no.
