{"title": "What to do for Netflix Earnings Tonight", "selftext": "Netflix is scheduled to [report first-quarter earnings today](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/nflx). Investors are going to look for clarity on the company’s next steps regarding rules on password sharing, global price cuts, and the success of the new, lower-priced subscriber tier that features adverts.\n\nIn November, Netflix launched [its ad-tier to users in the U.S](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/announcing-basic-with-ads-us). This gives subscribers the option to stream their favorite shows, with the inclusion of advertisements for a lower price. This was meant to help the streaming giant attract new subscribers, or hold on to existing ones who might be struggling as inflation continues to run (Thanks Brandon).\n\nIn February, [Netflix started to implement new rules in different countries to regulate password sharing](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2023/02/24/netflix-password-sharing-crackdown-kick-people-off-account/11332667002/) in an attempt to bring in more revenue. The company has said that more than 100 million households were sharing accounts, affecting its ability to invest in programming. However, it's not like they're entirely banning account sharing - but rather they're looking to boost its monetization of account sharing. The company has introduced paid sharing of accounts in some Latin American countries last year, it expanded these tests to Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, and Spain in February. Also in February, reports came out that the company had [lowered monthly subscription prices in more than 100 territories](https://www.ampereanalysis.com/insight/netflix-price-drop-affects-more-than-10m-subscribers).\n\nCiti analyst [Jason Bazinet](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-bazinet-7766aa5/) wrote in a research note that earnings might look confusing this time around considering all the changes the company has made recently, but he encouraged people not to overact to this quarter's key performance indicators or financials - and keep their eye on the prize. I'm pretty  sure most analysts are on the same page as Jason here. Netflix is still very much a growing company, and this earning report is going to be an indication of it. Especially when most groups are offering a \"buy rating\" for Netflix, with price targets as high as the 400s. \n\nFrom [Buisness Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/netflix-q1-earnings-preview-1032236417): 36 analysts predict earnings of $2.86 per share as opposed to earnings of $3.53 per share in the same quarter of the previous year. Wall Street is expecting the company to report $8.17 billion, an increase of 3.89% over the prior year quarter. With regard to the current fiscal year, analysts expect a profit per share of $11.46, while the previous year saw a profit of $9.95.\n\nLast earnings Netflix popped up 4% after they reported fourth-quarter results that showed healthy gains in subscriber growth. Over the last 1 year, NFLX has beaten EPS estimates 50% of the time and has beaten revenue estimates 75% of the time.\n\nGiven all this information, it would be reasonable to go for a Netflix call spread. A 4/21 330/340c is only $340, which may offer ~3x gains if Netflix goes up about 5% tonight.", "id": "12qxya3", "created_utc": 1681840008.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|5 days ago\n**Total Comments**|16|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12qxya3/what_to_do_for_netflix_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12kvaap/your_play_for_uhn_earnings_tomorrow/) \n**Account Age**|1 week|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/CalmGains, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: I think Netflix is going to have a good earnings report, and I'm going to buy a call spread.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This aged really well.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I know this is hard for WSB to comprehend, but the best move here is probably to just buy shares, no? \n\nSell at open tomorrow no matter what happens to minimize losses, you’re talking about a 5% swing max and the options payout is VERY small if it doesn’t move big", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Here me out tho. \n\n\n30x overnight feels really good", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "Bull call spreads.

Today intraday felt far more bearish than the day actually closed. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21usf0icipua1.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b734b82c4c0335114d55d35d7a5ff2897d40560\n\nI did NOT play a position on Netflix (I have a pretty hard set rule NOT to trade earnings…) but I would have eyed some 310 puts on Netflix… as of right now that would have paid out impressively well.. See how this holds in the morning. \n\nNetflix has a way in my opinion of shaping the future of earnings for tech… Next up is Tesla tomorrow… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8mv8fxzcipua1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9ec10561fb63866bcbc74af9d742193b7fc31cc\n\nTesla is expecting a 6.4% move per IV for tomorrow and actually interestingly enough their EPS is predicted to be fairly low compared to the last few earnings only predicting us to be 0.85. I still do not recommend any earnings plays but I am putting out the information for others. \n\n**BONUS TESLA**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t8tva8jdipua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=26fbcc3044818fff4ac988c1eea06ba6702bc070\n\nI don’t usually include tesla but including it today for a freebie as many have requested it return… its not staying but since earnings are tomorrow lets talk about it…\n\nWeekly wise we have been holding this red channel of 166.94 to 208 since the week of January 23rd and we have now formed a massive breakout/ breakdown triangle… one could actually infer that this triangle is a massive bear flag too… Now if we see Tesla break below 181.3 by EOW then we are breaking that support and I would see that as a fairly tempting short play and honestly a closure under 166.94 would be further confirmation of downside… I would start to target 150.1 and 133.26.\n\nHowever, IF earnings come in good and we get an upside pump then key resistance is 203.08 followed by confirmation at 208 EOW. For me I actually would be fairly tempted to play a 30-60dte call or put in the direction of Tesla post earnings… \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dditpy3eipua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2195f65837c3201efd5bdb94f3d825dc1086c168\n\nInteresting day today… we FINALLY got a new supply put in. With a new supply put in at 414.1 (just below previous 414.13 supply) we now start to target 411.04 and 409.73 supplies. However, this is where we are once again in a weird pattern here.. we established a new supply which should generally be seen a resistance… however the way today opened and moved actually put the supply in lower than todays close which actually makes this a support area to watch… This is where things get complicated and we have to be careful… \n\nWhile a new supply means we look to retest lower supplies and target previous demand (support) which currently is 411.04 -> 409.73 and 409.18… when market is imbalanced like this we could actually bounce form here and attempt to immediately turn this 414.13 supply into a demand (support) which would be extremely bullish… Turning a supply into demand or a demand into supply is an extremely strong move. \n\nSpy is still in extreme bull momentum and the daily chart still is setting up for reversal conditions… however they are not quite perfect just yet…. Daily 8ema should still attempt to hold as support… if and when we lose that daily 8ema is when it will be time to look out below…\n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/13ounfkeipua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fee0ba9d0e9cd0ee1d0e3bd1d3183f73016beffc\n\nThe price action here on spy daily actually perfectly held the resistance line of that red rising wedge at 415.7 however, once again we had a bigger bounce off the low with no bearish continuation and that led to this lower end wick… \n\nThe rising wedge continues to come to a tighter point here which very well could come to an end tomorrow… generally speaking rising wedges are bearish reversal patterns and when formed with this cup and handle potentially here on the daily… we are looking at a hard top with a bigger drop possible… \n\nKey support is 413.9 tomorrow and resistance at 415.9.\n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 414.1 -> 415.4 -> 417  \n Demand- 409.2  \n Support- 414.1 -> 412.4 -> 409.6  \n Resistance- 415.6 -> 416.9 -> 419.6\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fl397c2fipua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d2a55bd20503142678fd110b8e95e5a31a988d4\n\nToday we also saw a new supply put in on futures daily at 4178… this is a major level to watch as this is a resistance level that dates back to February. \n\nNow with this new supply here and being that futures is far more balanced than SPY daily (another reason I like watching both) this shows that we could easily see a retest of 4160 and possible 4154 support (previous supplies) tomorrow or later this week. Our target here should be previous demand at 4116 if we can break through those 4160/4154 levels.\n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1iym6nfipua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=659f2c791965f353c2ac1fe17380d30e45839141\n\nLike I mentioned 4178 is a major level and you can see yesterdays rejection there was a major rejection for the 3rd time (With a candle body). Now interestingly enough we did pump over night and touched 4198 and nearly perfectly rejected it… not only that but we now have formed a rising wedge inside of the rising wedge. \n\nCurrently blue rising wedge support sits at 4160 for tomorrow (which is a supply level) and resistance sits at 4200 and then 4218. \n\nThe one thing that is clear as we have tested this 414+ area and 4160+ area is that we have come into some heavy resistance. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4154 -> 4160 -> 4178 -> 4198  \n Demand- 4116  \n Support- 4152 -> 4139  \n Resistance- 4200 -> 4236\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d4nhif2gipua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=da1d8872624ec702c74cc7f5dad127b04dd9ae05\n\nI continue to remain impressed that the VIX goes lower and lower… \n\nThe VIX, formally known as the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index, measures how much volatility professional investors think the S&P 500 index will experience over the next 30 days. Market professionals refer to this as “implied volatility”—implied because the VIX tracks the options market, where traders make bets about the future performance of different securities and market indices, such as the S&P 500.\n\nAbove is a reminder of exactly what the VIX is… now lets talk about this for a second… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p1qwxkhgipua1.png?width=1006&format=png&auto=webp&s=bad7b3968fd8a106ac491a09f377aa00ea32a005\n\nOver 40% of all S&P-related options are now same day expiry (Source: Optionmetrics), or “zero-day-to-expiry” options, shorthanded as “0DTE”. Ten years ago this number was about 5-10%. The daily volume of 0DTE contracts on the S&P 500 (SPX) increased from around 400,000 in January 2022 to approximately 1.2 million in March 2023, representing a three-fold increase in daily volume, according to data from OptionMetrics. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nw9fy3wgipua1.png?width=974&format=png&auto=webp&s=a421709803e9d1f1623d6c427c38449a04b2e853\n\nWhat does this mean and why does it matter? Well this is just my opinion and gonna be a bit of a tin foil hat/ rant moment… We are starting to see days where the VIX is red (dropping) and Spy is red… and we are also seeing a lot of times now where SPY is going on a sell off only to see a huge EOD recovery… \n\nWhat is causing this and why are we getting tiny movement and no continuation? \n\nMy opinion here is that we are seeing a few things happening… with this massive spike of 0dte options big money is playing options intraday and they are getting their instant hit and then through the rest of the day taking that OI off the boards and often times causing huge recoveries when they do so… \n\nWhy are we not seeing continuation? Well the underlying VIX is not rising… why? Well no one is going short with long DTE… everyone is trading 0dte or similar net short positions… there is no more of these longer DTE contracts that take a week or two to play out… but according to many articles and analysts… big money is the most net short since 2011 and 2018 (depends on the article)… but how could the VIX be in the 16s which by all means is a bull market level? \n\nWell this is my thoughts… Markets are pretty much being set up to get slaughtered here soon. Why? Well what is happening is that markets once again do not believe jpow… they believe we are getting 100bps of rate cuts by EOY… but that’s not going to happen (as of now according to JPOW)… markets are “forward looking” but there is a lot to be said that they are too forward looking right now… plus we know historically its time to sell the last rate hike… Now if that was last meeting (if jpow changes his tune) but most likely that will be this May 3rd meeting… IF that is the last rate hike (if JPOW hard hints at this) then we are likely seeing a top on SPY and we are going to start to see some heavy downside… \n\nNow much like a month ago in march when we had the Bank run… we had huge spikes in the VIX… why? Well markets FINALLY thought there was a reason to not only sell… but to continue to sell as they thought we were apart of the next great financial crisis (we may still be)… however, quickly the VIX would dump… why? Well markets no longer believed that was the case which has led to this rally…\n\nHonestly we are in for some pretty serious pain for the next 2 weeks unless earnings severely tank the markets. Now if earnings come in bad and give bad guidance (or recession hints) we might start to see the VIX push back up leading into FOMC… but I think we might be in some pain sitting in this 400-420 area for the next few weeks until FOMC and CPI… Markets need a reason to sell off and to continue to sell off and they just have not had that reason yet… \n\n0dte options has forever changed the game. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zn1knynhipua1.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7ebc6fc7896d42342d301287673d392f7899610\n\nToday I experimented with using 1dte SPX options again… if you have been following me for a while you knowing I used to love SPX 0dte scalps and level to level plays for all of 2022… however, come November when 0dte everday hit the markets the game changed forever… we were left with some extremely choppy and awful premiums… I had moved to further dte because we were having issues of entering and basically immediately being down 5-7%... getting stopped out and then seeing a huge move… it also was not entries and we were seeing premiums moving outside that of actual price action… \n\nWell I did experiment with some 1dte SPX today and so far I don’t hate it… I will continue to monitor this over the next week or so and see if I want to stick with 1dte or go back to 2dte SPY… The biggest thing I did notice today though was that mid day consolidation that the 1dte premiums got ate up extremely fast and often times led to being correct on the move and direction but finding ourselves losing value as the play moved in our direction.", "id": "12r45cv", "created_utc": 1681851507.0, "score": 67, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "This company doesnt grow anymore and has pe of 34 lol.
