{"title": "XMTR ‚Äì Cheap AI Stock. Great Upside Potential. This One‚Äôs Gonna Be Good.", "selftext": "*I‚Äôm a selfish bastard, so I usually don‚Äôt give away my best ideas but fuck it I could use the karma. Besides, my wife is on vacation with her boyfriend, so I had a lot of time to myself to actually do some quality due-diligence on this stock.*\n\n**The Headline**\n\nXometry (XMTR) is a massively underappreciated play on how AI is going to change manufacturing ‚Äì and it‚Äôs pretty fuckin cheap right now.\n\n**For Those of You Who Have a Fourth Grade Reading Level**\n\n¬∑ XMTR connects the people who design shit with the people who can actually make that shit.\n\n¬∑ They operate in a ~~$2,000,000,000,000~~ total addressable market.\n\n¬∑ They use AI with better data than anyone else in the field (good moat).\n\n¬∑ They have faced some short-term headwinds that have made the stock cheap (for now).\n\n**The Business**\n\n¬∑ XMTR has created a marketplace to connect product developers (NASA, BMW, Dell, SpaceX, you name it.) with manufacturers for custom parts manufacturing. This process used to be done through local connections, but, with XMTR's platform, this can be done much faster, cheaper, and at greater volume.\n\n¬∑ They are doing this in a ginormous total addressable market sized at $2 trillion for global manufacturing where they only had revenue of $381 million for all of last year (but grew 75%!).\n\n¬∑ XMTR is a newer company and in the early innings of user awareness where they have seen customers in industries from electric vehicle manufacturers, aerospace and defense, pharmaceuticals, consumer technology all grow spend at compounded annual growth rates between 121% up to 993%.\n\n¬∑ Being the outright winner as a marketplace/having a first mover advantage is important as you can see with AirBnb, Amazon, and Uber who have won early to create significant value from digitizing their markets. Looking back, wouldn‚Äôt you have invested in Amazon at Day 1?\n\n¬∑ This is playing out as competitors like [Fast Radius](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/chicago-tech-company-fast-radius-files-for-chapter-11-after-the-spac-deal-216941/) and [Shapeway‚Äôs](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/shapeways-hit-with-nyse-non-compliance-notice-for-failing-to-meet-listing-standards-214028/) have either gone bankrupt or are very close.\n\n**AI & Positive Feedback Loops**\n\n¬∑ So, what‚Äôs the special sauce? [Artificial intelligence](https://chat.openai.com/) and machine learning. They continue to create a positive feedback loop where every buyer attracts more sellers and thus attracts more buyers. For those of you who haven't attended an intro to business webinar like I have, this phenomenon is called a network effect.\n\n¬∑ This entire flywheel is powered by the droves of quality data they are collecting. Proper pricing, matching, and lead times between product developers and the 625,000 manufacturers in the USA alone is difficult and takes YEARS to develop since it has never been done before.\n\n¬∑ While they have had some hiccups that hurt near term numbers and caused some bears to huddle up, they now have better data and algorithms than anyone else in the market and have better trained their machines which keeps competitors from coming anywhere close to competing with them. I love a good moat, don‚Äôt you?\n\n*\\*NOT TO MENTION\\* there are 10,000 owners of manufacturing shops retiring and selling their businesses every day to engineers that understand and have a use for XMTR‚Äôs tech offering.*\n\n**A Good Deal**\n\n¬∑ NVIDIA (NVDA) is trading at 20x sales and XMTR is at \\~ 2x sales. At 1/10th the price but growing 70% faster over the last 12 months, XMTR is the AI play of a century (wow!).\n\n¬∑ Short interest ratio at 11% and moving upwards as bears are peaking their heads out of the forest to push this thing back up to 20% again.\n\n¬∑ Their bearish sentiments are wrong, and we‚Äôll be handsomely rewarded for our contrarianism.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n*Disclaimer: This isn‚Äôt financial advice, it‚Äôs my advice ‚Äì take that as you will. What you should know: I‚Äôm a tard. Some of you might think my analysis is on the shorter side, but what I would say is that sometimes the best of things only require the shortest of descriptions to demonstrate their value.
