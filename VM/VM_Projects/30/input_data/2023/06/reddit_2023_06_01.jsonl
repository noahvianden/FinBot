It‚Äôs Time to Cash Out.**  \n>  \n> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pushing the absolute limit of what sustainable value is,‚Äù says NYU‚Äôs Aswath Damodaran on Nvidia stock.   \n>  \n>By Jack Hough  \n>  \n>May 31, 2023 11:31 am ET  \n>  \n>Nvidia just became the first chip maker to top $1 trillion in stock market value, and a finance professor who has invested since 2017 sold his shares. ‚ÄúI got lucky on that one,‚Äù he says.  \n>  \n>Perhaps. But this particular professor is nicknamed the Dean of Valuation for his decades of work on how to estimate what assets are worth. So his sale raises the question of why he thinks Nvidia (ticker: NVDA) doesn‚Äôt belong in the trillion-dollar club with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN). After all, companies with ties to artificial intelligence are being richly rewarded at the moment, and Nvidia has a dominant market share in AI chips.  \n>  \n>Also, which of the other tech giants look too expensive now? And is the fact that recent market gains have been powered by a handful of stocks a problem?  \n>  \n>‚ÄúThis lack-of-breadth thing drives me crazy,‚Äù Aswath Damodaran told Barron‚Äôs on Tuesday. ‚ÄúYou know what? Markets have never had breadth.‚Äù  \n>  \n>Damodaran teaches corporate finance and equity valuation at New York University‚Äôs Stern School of Business. He has written numerous textbooks on those subjects‚Äî‚Äùobscenely overpriced‚Äù ones, as he puts it. He recently looked at 80 years of market data and found that big bull runs were commonly carried by 10% of stocks or less. Today, he owns most of the tech giants, three of which he says he bought ‚Äúat their absolute bottoms last year.‚Äù  \n>  \n>These include Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META), recently $262 a share. ‚ÄúWhen Facebook hit $95 per share, I said, given its cash flows, this is like American Express \\[AXP} as Warren Buffett saw it after the salad oil scandal,‚Äù says Damodaran. ‚ÄúThe cash flows from its advertising business over four years covers that price. I‚Äôm buying it and hoping that they don‚Äôt screw it up with the metaverse.‚Äù  \n>  \n>Historical detour: The salad oil scandal refers to a 1960s scheme whereby the Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Company borrowed from American Express using exaggerated soybean oil inventories as collateral. It used the proceeds to buy soybean oil futures, in order to push prices higher for the nonexaggerated portion of its inventory. There was a whistleblower, losses, a ripple effect, and bankruptcies, and, looking back, it created an opportunity to buy AmEx shares on the cheap. If you‚Äôre wondering why no one has made a movie about this colorful episode, there‚Äôs already a script and a studio, CNBC‚Äôs Ron Insana is involved in the effort, and Buffett likes the idea, according to Deadline.  \n>  \n>Back to Nvidia. ‚ÄúThat was in my portfolio till this morning,‚Äù Damodaran said on Tuesday. ‚ÄúAnd I finally got it out of my portfolio because I couldn‚Äôt take the rise. You had $300 billion in a week. You‚Äôre pushing the absolute limit of what sustainable value is.‚Äù  \n>  \n>He estimates that Nvidia has an 80% share of a $25 billion AI chip market today, and the most bullish assumptions put the size of the market at $350 billion in a decade. Even assuming 100% future market share, he wasn‚Äôt able to get to a value closer than 20% below Nvidia‚Äôs recent price. ‚ÄúI love Nvidia as a company,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut as an investment at $400-plus per share, I just can‚Äôt get there.‚Äù  \n>  \n>More broadly, Damodaran says that Nvidia is essentially a hardware company, whereas other members of the trillion-dollar club have used software to draw vast numbers of end users into their ecosystems. That creates what a statistician might call a long-tail distribution of business opportunities‚Äîmany ways to earn from new products and services.  \n>  \n>A company that sells chips to other businesses faces natural constraints, says Damodaran. ‚ÄúThe tails in the distribution tend to be much more prudent,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThe upside is not as large as it could potentially be for a consumer-based company with an ecosystem of billions of users. And that kind of crimps how much you‚Äôre willing to bet on that optionality.‚Äù  \n>  \n>Damoraran compares his current thinking on Nvidia with how he felt about Tesla (TSLA) when it hit $1.2 trillion in value in November 2021. ‚ÄúI pushed to full throttle and I couldn‚Äôt get within $300 billion of that $1.2 trillion.‚Äù Shares tanked. They started bouncing back around the beginning of this year. In hindsight, they were reasonably priced in January, Damodaran says, but by the time he got around to working up a fresh valuation in February, ‚Äúit kind of got out of hand again.‚Äù  \n>  \n>Damodaran doesn‚Äôt own Netflix (NFLX). Outside of tech, he just bought Citigroup \\[C\\]. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is a much better bank, he says, but the price on Citi is so low that all it has to do is ‚Äúhave management that can chew gum and walk at the same time.‚Äù  \n>  \n>One way to compare Citi to other banks is to look at the ratio of its share price to its book value per share. But this sort of relative valuation is for traders, Damodaran says. Investors, in his opinion, are better off estimating how much to pay for a business based on its future cash flows.  \n>  \n>‚ÄúI entirely understand the use of multiples and comparables as your way of trading,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut I do have conniptions when these same people talk about, ‚ÄòI care about value. This is all about valuation.‚Äô No, it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs a pricing game. You play it really well. Claim credit for it when you do. But let‚Äôs not talk about value in the context of pricing, because it‚Äôs a very different game.‚Äù  \n>  \n>Is the market fairly priced? Don‚Äôt bother trying to tell, says Damodaran. Just buy index funds and hold, or pick good stocks, or both.  \n>  \n>How about Bitcoin‚Äôs latest bounceback? Its fans are ‚Äúnever going to let it become a good currency because it‚Äôs in their best interest to keep it as a volatile instrument that they can speculate on,‚Äù he says.  \n>  \n>Asked where the bubbles are now, Damodaran named an asset class that doesn‚Äôt spring to mind as a source of systemic financial risk: professional sports teams. For example, Major League Baseball, he says, is a low-growth business with yearly pretax, pre-reinvestment cash flow of $600 million. That‚Äôs worth perhaps $10 billion ‚Äúon a good day.‚Äù But the collective price of teams is closer to $70 billion.  \n>  \n>Team prices today appear to be driven more by vanity than financial returns, but owners shouldn‚Äôt worry about the bottom falling out overnight, says Damodaran. ‚ÄúAs long as the number of billionaires exceeds the number of sports franchises, there is no crash coming.‚Äù", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nah I want my calls to continue flying up TO THE MOON!!!! üöÄ", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Your funeral.

{"title": "Anyone buying AAPL calls before WWDC", "selftext": "apple is about to announce product which may lead to a big stock increase \nGiven the recent rumors of Apple's highly anticipated VR headset announcement on June 5th, there has been speculation regarding market interest in purchasing Apple call options. This is because Apple has historically experienced significant stock price increases upon the release of new products, especially those that break new ground in their respective markets.\n\nFor example, Apple's first iPhone release in 2007 revolutionized the smartphone industry and generated a lot of excitement and anticipation. In the months leading up to the announcement, there was a lot of buzz around the product, and this was reflected in the company's stock price. On the day of the announcement, Apple's stock jumped 8%, and continued to rise in the following weeks, resulting in a 25% increase in the company's market cap.\n\nSimilarly, the release of the iPad in 2010 generated a lot of hype and speculation, and Apple's stock price saw a substantial increase in the months leading up to the announcement. On the day of the announcement, Apple's stock rose 1.2% and continued to rise in the following weeks, leading to a 12% increase in the company's market cap.\n\nMore recently, the announcement of the Apple Watch in 2014 generated a lot of buzz and excitement, and the company's stock price saw a significant increase in the weeks leading up to the announcement. On the day of the announcement, Apple's stock rose 2.7%, and continued to rise in the following weeks, resulting in a 9% increase in the company's market cap.\n\nGiven Apple's track record of producing innovative and groundbreaking products, it is plausible that the rumored VR headset announcement could have a similar effect on the company's stock price. The market may be anticipating a substantial increase in demand for the product, which could translate into higher revenue and earnings for Apple. Additionally, with Apple's reputation for consistently improving upon its products, there is optimism among investors that the VR headset will be well-received and help to solidify Apple's position as a leader in the technology industry.\n\nAs a result, there may be market interest in purchasing Apple call options in anticipation of a potential rise in the company's stock price following the announcement. Early indications suggest that Apple's VR headset may contain cutting-edge technology, such as eye-tracking sensors and advanced haptic feedback, which could make it a game-changer in the VR market. If the rumors are true and the product lives up to expectations, Apple's stock price may experience a significant boost in the coming weeks.", "id": "13xw6l4", "created_utc": 1685660458.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|66|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Apple is about to announce a new product (VR headset) on June 5th, which has generated a lot of hype and speculation.
