It‚Äôs very hard to for companies to switch even when offered a more efficient and cheaper HW solution. Only large cloud companies like AWS, Microsoft and Google can potentially build the end to end solution to challenge.\n\nAnd two, the AI pie is so big and growing so fast, the big cloud guys, even with their own solutions, will have to buy up all NVDIA chip anyways to keep up demand. All the challengers have to fight for TSMC capacity and at the end of the day there are only so many wafers TSMC can pump out.\n\nFinally NViDIA has long been a monopoly on GPUs which is a very profitable even before AI.
