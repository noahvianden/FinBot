{"title": "Seeking Wisdom of thetagang. Selling CSP on TQQQ", "selftext": "Hello All,\nI know there has been a lot about TQQQ here, but I wanted to throw out my algorithm and see if anyone had insights or comments. Thanks!\n\nThe Goal: \n- To outperform QQQ and SPY. Not to outperform TQQQ in a bull market.\n- Avoid assignment, but not the end of the world either.\n- I see the next few years, possibly all decade, being flat (lost decade). Still want to make money.\n___________\n\nThe Algorithm:\n- Sell or roll weekly cash secured puts on tqqq for a strike price about 10% otm. (Target 0.5-0.75% return on capital per week).\n\n- Do not wait for red days. Always have money working.\n\n- Only roll to the next weekly on Friday or if lost more than 70% of value. \n\n- Maybe roll to the same Friday weekly if lost more than 70% before Wednesday. Will have to roll up in strike price.\n\n- Only roll at the end of the day.\n\n- If caught ITM, roll down and out to the nearest strike date possible or to next monthly for net even or small credit. Dont be tempted to roll too early if still otm.\n\n- If caught again, keep rolling down and out. Sell more puts with opened up capital. \n\n- Wait until tqqq spikes for profit and restart the Algo or just keep holding.\n\n- Repeat until mil/bilionaire\n______________\n\nProgress so far:\nBeen doing this for about 8 months, mostly in Roth IRAs. Doing about 20-25% return annualized.\n______________\n\nBiggest risks:\n- Stocks crash continuously for months and years. Will be stuck waiting for puts to lose value and not have any cash to actually buy TQQQ at a good price. Lose out on the big upswing.\n\n- Lots of taxable events. Best to do in a Roth or tax deferred account.\n\n- The unseen risks (why I came here)\n______________\n\nSolutions:\n- NASDAQ worst single day drop around 10%. So tqqq would be down 30%. Can still find options down and out far enough to roll to.\n\n- Even during dot com bubble, NASDAQ lost about 3% per month for 2.5 years. TQQQ would lose about 10% per month. But TQQQ would have to average losing 10% per week to prevent you from making money over this large bear market.\n\n- Even during 2022 downturn, tqqq averaged about 6-7% loss per month. So still safe strategy.\n\n- Can always decide to take assignment if tqqq gets very very low and wanting to switch to a more aggressive long position.\n\n- This strategy avoids timing the market prospectively AND gives you the power to time the market retroactively. Say tqqq dips 5%, then IV goes up, you roll the put and take advantage of the IV crush. \n\nThanks for any feedback!

I have a buddy who owns a truck repair company who contracts with Fedex, Ryder, and Enterprise (they have rental trucks).\n\nUPS and Fedex have in house mechanics........but they take care of the simple stuff.  Wiper replacement, lightbulbs, some oil changes, etc.  Big stuff like injector replacement, transmission work, etc goes out to people who are equipped for that.  So the AC stuff is going to an outside vendor.\n\nNOW.........you need to prototype and develop a system to go into those hot boxes they call trucks.  Are we putting AC into the whole cargo area and driver compartment??  Or just the driver compartment??  Lotta sq ftge in the cargo area...........means more BTU's to cool it.\n\nYour restricted by the area in front of the radiator where the condenser will go (the condenser strips the heat from the refrigerant).  More BTU's the bigger the condenser needs to be, and you'll need more refrigerant.  \n\nDoes the engine compartment have room for the compressor??  Need to make a space for that somewhere.  All of the new engines have serpentine belts so you'll need to mount it somewhere where the serpentine belt will work or be able to add another pulley and belt.\n\nNext we get into the refrigerant.............up until a few years ago all heavy equipment and trucks used R134 as a refrigerant.  That is being phased out.  All passenger cars and light trucks now used 1234xy as a refrigerant.  That uses propane or butane for cooling.  It's classed as a semi flammable.  They will probably go with 1234xy since 134 is being phased out........but its 2-3 x as expensive as R134 (go figure on that one).\n\nOnce you get a working prototype and size it the BTU's needed.........your off and running.  Cookie cutter installs...........but it's time consuming.\n\nAlso, look at a company called RED DOT.  They make AC kits for install on trucks and farm equipment that don't have existing AC in the cabs.  They might be a contender to make these kits.  Also, as an aside; alot of fire trucks don't have AC in them.........or when they get made new today, the AC is almost an after thought and the systems they put in them don't do jack squat for cooling.\n\nJust my thoughts on the fly........", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Ummm....
