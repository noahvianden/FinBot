{"title": "INTC Modified Wheel Strategy", "selftext": "I saw a post like this earlier, so I wanted to post a similar trade \"lifecycle\" post. I thought this would be a good contrast to  u/OptionCo [most recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/124wb3v/spx_12_delta_srangle_day_in_the_life_example/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), which is undoubtedly much more skillfully executed. But I thought this could provide another example, but for less experienced options traders (like myself admittedly).\n\nFor a little background, I am a fundamental analyst through work and have had some decent success doing long term investing with my personal account. I have been learning about options over the past few years and wanted to implement some of the strategies starting last year.\n\nMy stock of choice was INTC (joke's on me so far). I started by selling cash covered puts in 2022 when I thought the stock was undervalued. I got assigned the stock as sentiment and financial performance clearly became much worse for INTC and the semiconductor industry in general. My long term analysis still indicates it's undervalued based on current pricing, but I have more recently accepted the short term bearish sentiment and have been selling calls to reduce my breakeven price. The stock has been in a pretty sustained trading range over (\\~25 to \\~32) the last 6 months, which has helped my strategy. The dividend has also been helping, but was recently reduced so it'll be less of an offset going forward, but might actually be beneficial to the stock price long term.\n\nI have documented trades and strategy/thinking below. Feel free to ask questions or critique. Just hoping to learn some more and hopefully help others learn by example.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Trade History](https://preview.redd.it/1tcg7pyqpoqa1.png?width=875&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f6e5e3202dc0b92388c479ae8a053843363e193)", "id": "125p0n7", "created_utc": 1680098564.0, "score": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "Really, really interesting, loved the fact that you explain your reason to enter a given trade.\nSometimes you're right, sometimes not, like all traders, but at least you can see why and improve.\nThanks for sharing!", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "I replicated a wheel over the past year on INTC. In principle I was mechanical so that I sold a put, waited to assignment (or expiry) and then sold call or a new put etc...

So if a call became worthless quickly, I sold another not waiting for expiry.\n\nNot counting dividends and based on selling a single option I get to a P&L of -108$ for the year including trading costs.
