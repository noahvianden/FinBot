Therefore, the Governing Council today decided to increase the three key ECB interest** **rates** **by 50 basis points, in line with its determination to ensure the timely return of inflation to the 2% medium-term target.”**\n\n**It came after the Swiss National Bank was forced to step in to provide an emergency £45 billion loan facility to its second biggest lender Credit Suisse.**\n\n**Shares in Credit Suisse plummeted earlier this week on fears that it faced a collapse that could have sparked a global financial crisis and hit economic growth. The falls were triggered by its largest shareholder, Saudi National Bank, ruling out further investment. However, the shares rallied today after the Swiss National Bank’s intervention.**\n\n**The ECB said its Governing Council “is monitoring current market tensions closely and stands ready to respond as necessary to preserve price stability and financial stability in the euro area.”**\n\n**Other major central banks, including the Bank of England and the US Federal Reserve are thought likely to bring to an end the current cycle of big interest rises to curb galloping inflation.**\n\n**The ECB left it benchmark rate at zero or below for a decade from 2012 until September last year when it ordered a 0.75% rise. There have been three more hikes - one of of 0.7% and two of 0.5% - since then.**", "id": "11su69k", "created_utc": 1678973291.0, "score": 293, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "I do appreciate how the European bond market priced the chances of a 50bp hike at... 0%", "score": 216, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 55, "replies": [{"body": "THE FIRST SOCIAL MEDIA BANK RUN 🤡", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Then you have your cash, and wonder, “huh, where should I keep this 🤔”", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Tail is trying to wag the dog.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Been this way for weeks \n\nStocks are currently enabling the Fed to hike next week", "score": 11, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Oh man this feels like either throwing cold water on investors hopes and dreams or rubbing salt and bleach on them while laughing.", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Good.
