{"title": "Tesla Models To Offer Bi-Directional Charging Capability By 2025 | The announcement was made at the Investor Day event, but Elon Musk said he didn't expect widespread use of the feature by owners.", "selftext": "", "id": "11h167y", "created_utc": 1677851187.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "I'm surprised by the level of pushback here on V2X (Vehicle to X (X = Everything)). \n\nJust because Elon isn't a fan doesn't mean it's a bad idea, in fact it would help towards the goals that were stated in the presentation regarding accelerating the transition to a fully renewable grid.\n\nHow? Well any EV with V2X could also count towards the huge amount of storage that's required and, any time that a vehicle was idle, it could be playing its part in balancing the grid either through synthetic inertia or by allowing a few kW to go out to smooth demand peaks.\n\nGiven the suprising frequency of power outages in certain \"Developed\" countries, vehicles offering V2L, V2G and V2X are transforming their owners lives and influencing friends and neighbours. If you peek above the Tesla walled garden to see what owners of other makes are saying then you'll find:\n\n\\- Hyundai owners raving about how their Ioniq 5 ran their essentials for 3 days. \n\n\\- Ford Lightning owners, Sandy Munroe no less, raving about how their vehicles saved the day. There's plenty of annecdotes from owners who, after powering their homes and sheltering their neighbours, are now reporting that their whole street (affluent I presume) have gone straight out and placed orders for their own Ford Lightnings.\n\n\\- I've even seen a Honda City E owner over the moon because the \\~1kW onboard inverter kept their fridge freezer on during a long spell without power (That must ease the pain of it having a small battery and poor range to begin with!).\n\nComing back to Tesla, they've proven that if anyone can cost-down an electronic component, they can, and when it comes to V2X it is not a colossally complex component; Ford's managing and anything Ford can do we all know Tesla can do a whole lot better.\n\nA final point I'd make is somewhat personal; I don't have a whole heap of money, I've invested all I can spare in to Tesla and, as a result, dont have cash available for a Power Wall or a Tesla vehicle. If money became available then the priority would be the car (M3 LR please) and if that had bidirectional charging then that just saves me more money so I can get a Power Wall sooner.\n\nAnother issue with not having a whole heap of money is that I've always existed at the opposite end of the vehicle market, finding a good value used vehicle that I can fix up and use. Early Nissan Leaf's are getting to the point where their batteries are no use for transport but wouldn't you know it, many of them have bi-directional charging and a number of companies are coming out with chargers that can enable that. I'd happily pick up a tired Nissan Leaf just to park it by the house and use it as a \\~20kWh battery. For those with spare cash, procuring these tired leafs could be a wise purchase ; )\n\nNow imagine a future when a Tesla with V2X has done 2 million miles and probably won't make it though it's next vehicle inspection without serious work, why not let the old thing retire next to your house and provide you with \\~50kWh+ battery eh?", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Super useful in a disaster.\n\nWhere is our V2L feature already?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Right?

This would let you charge the truck battery with the extra power the camper is not drawing. \n\nPower output and the frunk design are two things I think Ford did really well on the Lightning, the only downside is that 240V power is limited to 24A(80% of the L14-30 30A outlet) rather than using a 14-50 outlet which would provide more power.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I'm all for it as long as it is a paid option.\n\n I would buy it.
