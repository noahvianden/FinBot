It doesnt matter where a stock trades, in which currency it is denominated or whether it is an ADR or not. The only difference is the time the stock is traded at.\n\nThis creates the illusion that a stock and its ADR may trade in different directions when in reality they are not. Everything is trading uniformily. But when japanese are sleeping and exchanges are closed, US opens and vice versa (roughly). And of course japanese stocks are to some degree dependent what is happening in the US and vice versa. So, naturally, japanse companies/stocks are valued in real time all the time and if there is a singular event in the US that affects japan and its economy, of course stocks will move. It doesnt matter if a given stock exchange is open or closed, the value of the company changes in that very second. It just takes time until the stock moves because the only reason a stock can move is if a buyer and a seller agree for a price. So stock VALUES move all the time while PRICES are created with a delay until buyer and seller match and this for the most part depends on the stock exchange open hours and after close trading hours.\n\nYou can easily prove this yourself if you just took at how the closing price of the tokyo-based stock affects the opening price of ADRs trading in the US and vice versa. In reality, the US ADRs move in tandem in real time, but they dont of course move on paper because at 2am there is no buyer matched to a seller.\n\nConcerning the currency thing, of course it again doesnt matter which currency a stock is denominated in. The only reason that is important is because if a company is e.g. located in japan and has most of its costs in Yen but makes most of their revenue in USD and now the USD appreciated vs the Yen, the company had an huge advantage. Of course this can be detrimental vice versa.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think this is pretty basic stuff here.\n\nAlso, there are assets that trade 24/7 and you can easily see how those assets move very much in tandem all the time on paper irrespective of the currency they trade in, which easily disproves your point.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Alright.
