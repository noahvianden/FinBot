{"title": "TSLA Tesla Evaluation - Fundamental Analysis", "selftext": "Hello Investors and Gamblers! We all know what Tesla is, but do we really know what it is worth? Are you bagholding and want to know if you shall cut losses or hold it to the core of the Earth? Or are you looking for a good entry price for a heavy **Call** or **Put** slapping?\n\nWell you came to the righ post! Here i am evaluating TSLA Fair Value for you! Hope you enjoy the reading! And don't forget to share with the community your thought and prayers! Cheers!\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Purpose**\n\nThe purpose of this thesis is to analyse the development of Tesla during the past three years, from 2019 to 2022. Not only are the financial statements taken into consideration. In addition, a comparison to its main competitors and the market situation is also made. All is made to determine the fair value of the stock price and determine the investment strategy. All is made to answer the following questions:\n\n* What is its position compared to competitors?\n* Is the company fairly valued by the market by its fundamentals?\n* Is the company a Buy or a Sell?\n\n**Delimitations and Assumptions**\n\nThis thesis is delimited to an analysis of TSLA between the years 2019 and 2022. The thesis is based on the assumption that TSLA is the one of the most trending automotive company in the world, and that the prestige it has will support its price action in the next months.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nIn this thesis, data from its financial statements are taken from SEC filings, Yahoo Finance and other publicly available information on the company on-line. The Company valuation is made based on:\n\n* Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula\n* Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model\n* Discounted Cash Flow Model\n\n**Hypothesis**\n\n* US next interest rates hike of 25-50bps\n* Inflation of 6.5% and cooling down to 6% for January 2023\n* TSLA is high volume stock\n* TSLA is overvalued\n* There are many TSLA bagholders\n* TSLA can’t outproduce its competitors in the near nor mid term\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Methodology\n\nThe thesis used macroeconomics data from the 13th of January 2023 for its valuations, Income Statements, Balance Sheets and Cash Flow are considered and projected to the next three years. The final price tag is obtained by the average of three valuation methodology: Graham Formula, Discounted Cash Flow and Cash Flow Evaluation. It is then given a 20% margin of error in both direction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Data|Value|Source|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Levered Beta**|2.03|Yahoo Finance, 5y monthly|\n|**Unlevered Beta**|**1.99**|Calculation|\n|**CAPM**|**15.25%**|Calculation|\n|**WACC**|**12.84%**|Calculation|\n|**ROE**|**24.40%**|Next Year’s Analyst Growth Estimate|\n|**EPS**|**3.24**|Yahoo Finance|\n|**P/E**|**37.18**|Yahoo Finance|\n|**PEG ratio**|**2,13**|Calculation|\n|**Growth Rate Estimate**|**24.40%**|Analysts|\n|Outstanding Shares|3,157,752,000|Excel Data Type|\n\n# Macro Economic Data\n\n|Data|Value|Source|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Market Expected Return|9.40%|Motley Fools, 50y average market return (1972-2021)|\n|Risk Free Rate|3.48%|Yahoo Finance, 10y US Treasury Bonds|\n|Risk Premium|5.29%|calculation|\n|AAA Bond Yield|4.40%|Moody's Seasoned AAA Corporate Bond Yield|\n|Average US GDP Growth|3.18%|Tradingeconomics - Average US GDP growth rate (1947-2022)|\n|Current Market P/E|20.72|Multpl.com|\n|US interest Rate|4.40%|Trading Economics|\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Evaluation Methods\n\nIn this paper, three methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.\n\n# Growth Rate\n\n**The Growth Rate of 24.40%** is determined by the average analysts consensus for the company’s next year growth rate.\n\n# Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model\n\nThis simple model takes in mind the company last year’s available cash flow data, its WACC based discount rate of 12,84% and its Growth Rate of 24,40% to determine a fair value of **$78.88** per share.\n\n# Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula\n\nThis model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing. This thesis uses the adjusted formula to better adjust it to the current market environment.\n\nData used for the calculation:\n\n|Data|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|EPS|3.24|\n|Growth Rate|24.40|\n|AAA Bond Yield|4.40|\n\nThe Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$101.74**\n\n# Discounted Cash Flow Model\n\nThis thesis uses Free Cash Flow, gained by subtraction Capex from Cash floe From Operations. Free cash flow (FCF) is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable\n\nIn simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.\n\nIn this model, it is taken in mind the following data:\n\n|Data|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|WACC based discount rate|12.84%|\n|Growth rate|24.40%|\n|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|\n|Average Shares outstanding|3,157,752,000|\n\nWhich projected a FCF for the next five years as per follow:\n\nNote: the projection is based on the assumption the company will keep growing by a perpetual rate of 24.40%, which is highly improbable due to unknown future events and variations in the market. This shall be taken only as an indicative forecast.\n\nThe calculation gives us a Fair Value of **$70.99** per share\n\n&#x200B;\n\n## Final Fair Value\n\nThe Final price tag is determined as per following:\n\n|Data|Value|\n|:-|:-|\n|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|$78,88|\n|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|$101.74|\n|Discounted Free Cash Flow Model|$70.99|\n|**Final Price + 20% error margin**|**$104.83**|\n|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$83.87**|\n|**Final Price - 20% error margin**|**$62.90**|\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Products\n\nTesla recently lowered their products price tag amid demand fall. Here are listed the current price tag as of 13th January 2023:\n\n* **Tesla Model X** $109,990\n* **Tesla Model 3** $43,990\n* **Tesla Model Y** $52,990\n* **Tesla Model S** $94,990\n\nTotal worldwide unit sold in thousands:\n\n* 2022: 1,313\n* 2021: 935\n* 2020: 367\n* 2018: 244\n\nWe can observe a 40% increase of Unit sold in 2022.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# SWOT ANALYSIS\n\nStrengths\n\n* **Most Valuable Automotive Company**: It is currently the the automotive company with the highest market capitalisation.\n* **Tesla Increased its Electric Vehicle Delivery**: In 2022 it increased its deliveries of 40% from 935 thousands  to 1.3 million units.\n* **Cross-sell and Diversification**: Tesla has comprehensive insurance program for its vehicles in association with Liberty Mutual insurance company.\n* **Innovative Company**: Tesla has a very high rate of innovation, the market expects the company to develop competitive and profitable products.\n\n## Weaknesses\n\n* **Manufacturing Complications**: Tesla faces continuous launch, manufacturing and production ramp delays while launching their new vehicles and other products. For example, Tesla faced endless manufacturing challenges when they were about to launch Model X, which lead to constant delays for distribution. Similarly, the company went through extreme troubles while manufacturing Model X’s battery module assembly line at Gigafactory 1.\n* **Unable to meet demand might affect brand value**: Due to highly experimenting and complicated procedures, Tesla’ might face an unbalanced supply and demand, unable to meet the production ramp.\n* **Lack of High Volume Productio**n: It has failed to produce high volumes of automobiles for any of its models. Even now, as the company plans to manufacture Model 3 vehicles at high volume, it faces issues in terms of production cost and management resources.\n* **Shortage of Batterie**s: The shortage directly affectes the sales of electric vehicles and energy storage systems.\n* **Elon Musk as Tesla’s Sole Representative**: Musk is deeply involved in other projects and side quests.\n* **Financial Uncertainty**: Tesla has outstanding debt of $5.38 Billion. If the company is unable to generate enough cash flow to repay its debt, then there is a risk of delaying expansion, reducing investments, selling assets, etc.\n* **Employee Safety Concerns**: Tesla was recently fined in 2019 for creating a tent production line without a permit or safety inspection. Also, the company did not train workers about the risks of working in the tent for long periods under the scorching California’s heat.\n* **Leadership Wrangles**: Friction and conflict between management and the board of directors can undermine productivity and long-term success. Tesla’s management and board have been engaged in several power struggles.\n* **Tesla Faces Lawsuit over Sexual Misconduct**: Many Tesla workers filed a lawsuit alleging sexual misconduct and harassment at the workplace. The women have complained that the company fosters a dark culture of sexual misconduct. They also alleged that they were cat-called and were frequently subjected to shameful remarks, groping, and misogynistic behaviour.\n\n## Opportunities\n\n* **Sales expansion in untapped Market**: The most significant opportunity for the company right now is the Asian market, even tho there are increased risks.\n* **Less Expensive Car**: Tesla’s Model 3 is a more affordable version of Model S with less range, power, and fewer features.\n* **Bringing battery production technology in-house**: Tesla intends to make its own battery cells.\n* **Market Confidence in Tesla**: The stock market has shown confidence in Tesla after beating the projected car deliveries.\n\n## Threats\n\n* **Product Liability Claims**: The company has faced lawsuits and claims related to the failure of technology in their products. If these liability claims continued, then Tesla may be subjected to greater financial setbacks.\n* **Extensive Competition**: Tesla, Inc. faces aggressive competition from both alternative fuel vehicles (Hybrid, Plug-in hybrid, fully electric car) and self-driving technology. Many automotive brands in the luxury segment like Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lexus and in the economy segment like Toyota, Ford, General Motors , Volvo are getting ready for a fierce competition. Many brands are not only launching or planning to launch their environment-friendly-Self-driving technology but also, they are offering them at a comparably lower price.\n* **Product Defects**: Tesla’s cars and other energy products have exhibited major flaws in many cases. The defective products often have weaknesses in design, manufacturing, and other features which harm the company’s image permanently.\n* **Long term confidence**: Tesla, due to its unstable manufacturing conditions, suffers from disbelief among the public about its long-term existence, which can result in a deficiency in further business development.\n* **Customer Adaptation**: The company highly depends upon customers willingness to adopt electric vehicles.\n* **Disruption of Supply Due to Shortage of Materials**: Tesla can face major suspensions in the supply of manufacturing materials due to the increased prices. The company uses aluminum, steel, lithium, nickel, copper, and cobalt, as well as lithium-ion cells from suppliers. All these materials have volatile prices, which can affect the company’s production line severely in the future.\n* **High-Risk Factor Due to Usage of Lithium-ion**: Tesla uses lithium-ion cells in their battery packs. Lithium is a highly reactive and explosive element, which increases the risk factor of our products. Tesla has faced a a few cases where their cars have caught fire and vented smoke, which has defamed the company on a major level.\n* **Elon Musk’s Behavior Affecting Tesla’s Reputation**: Tesla’s entire reputation is built upon the cult of Elon Musk. But recently, his waky behavior and impulsive reactions are affecting Tesla.\n* **Competitors increasing productions of EV Vehicles**: Competitors are jumping in the EV segment eating huge portions of the market share.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n# Analysts Price Target\n\n**$436 High**\n\n**$250 Average**\n\n**$85 Low**\n\n**$83 OP’s**", "id": "10b6aq7", "created_utc": 1673645779.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "\"1.3 billion units\" delivered in 2022.

There have been several studies over the years showing that most Tesla buyers came over from brands like Toyota and end up switching away to other brands. This became unsustainable once the aforementioned issues filtered into the public consciousness. \n\nAlso, global car production has been supply limitted for years now. Which is why everyone was able to raise prices on everything. While other manufacturers were content with taking record profits as their waiting lists have become longer and longer, Tesla has been willing and able to increase production much more than them. This won them a lot of sales despite raising prices by a lot also, simply because a lot of people physically could not get an EV delivered unless they ordered from Tesla.\n\nTesla projected there being even more unfulfilled demand and thus pushed to increase production capacity even more. But while Tesla has invested a lot into those new factories and their competitors have been slower to invest individually, the constraints on global car supply are loosening and production is rising by a lot across the board. This has lead to Tesla delivery times dropping to mere weeks or months, depending on how far from the factory you live. So despite increasing market share last year, Tesla is now sitting on too much production capacity. Apparently they prefer decreasing prices to just letting capacity sit idle.

But that’s not the reality. Our population is growing, more people are investing, companies are producing more all leading to a larger economy. \n\n\n[So in 2000 the global balance sheet was $440T in 2020 it was $1,540T more than tripled in 20 years.](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-rise-and-rise-of-the-global-balance-sheet-how-productively-are-we-using-our-wealth) So companies that maintained their market share in products that were in demand could triple in size without “stealing” a penny from another company (in theory but realistically new sectors and products cycle in and out of demand). There isn’t an unlimited amount of growth, but it’s also not really limited. \n\n\n\nTo further drive in the point that the economy isn’t pie I’ll try to explain how this growth can occur. Say a real estate developer buys a lot for $50k. He then takes out a loan for $200k to build a house. Which he pays to $HD for materials. A year later he then sells the house to me for $500k. So his $250k made another $250k in “wealth”. The bank made money on the loans while losing nothing, the builder made money while losing nothing, Home Depot made money while losing nothing, now I the home buyer didn’t “make money” would probably “lose money” to interest, but then as the builder builds more houses the value of mine goes up and my “wealth” goes up. The only limit to wealth growth is the finite about of resources such as land and lumber. It’s similar with any product, then everyone gets to dip their toes in and grow without taking away from anyone. \n\n\nSo I’m not really worried about what you’re talking about. Large companies aren’t really “stealing market cap” from other companies. They might buy out IP or tech (like Microsoft and GPT) but there’s other competition and and an almost unlimited amount of wealth to be shared. We as share holders and consumers also get to dictate who thrives. If we stopped investing in companies we didn’t like they would either change their policies or drown. That’s the beautify in capitalism, it’s completely dictated by capital and where we as capital holders choose to put it.
