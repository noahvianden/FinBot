", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "No problem. \n\nAs for AAPL I think investors have an overly negative sentiment for no real reason. You’ll read about how Apple is dead 24-7 since jobs died, and to some extent even before. If Apple has a reality distortion investors seem to have the inverse. Thinking Apple is done because a shitty octocore phone came out for less $ than the X. The fundamentals of Apple are obviously strong, so a subjective view is better suited imo. \n\nStrengths:\nVertical integration out the ass - no one comes close in the phone space. This gives you more of a lead on competition and allows you to do things others cannot aka Face ID etc. \n\nInsanely high profit margin, not driven by being “overpriced” per se but also because they are ruthless with their supply chain. That’s the main thing Tim Cook is bringing to the table and boy does he bring it.\n\nControl over the premium end of the market, whether it’s phones, tablets, laptops or computers. Apple knows to not race to the bottom and maintains a high quality brand.\n\nWearables; while I think this is overdone, Apple is the only company doing this properly, and is a good representation of how well they’ll handle new wearables/miniature computers. \n\n**chip design**: this is insane, and easily apple’s greatest strength atm. Look up qualcomm’s Performance and you’ll wonder how Apple is achieving what they are. It’d be like if intel was 3x as fast as AMD, and also increasing more every year as a proportion. Apple’s chip design chops extend beyond their phone processors/GPUs. The EarPods, while a moderate commercial success, are an example of how insanely good Apple is at miniaturizing their hardware and letting it dip battery drop by drop. Compare them to google’s equivalent and it’s embarrassing. Apple realistically will leverage their chips to power macs in the near future, allowing for even higher performance, higher battery life, and lower cost to them. \n\nChallenges:\nLack of diversity - They are still rather reliant on good iPhone launches to drive their revenue. One bad launch and they are tanked for that year, and their brand (which is very important to driving demand) is tarnished.\n\nFuture of things - if Apple can leverage their chips to perform local processing, great. However it’s possible that most operations will be performed in the cloud. This is a ways out, but is a risk that in 5 Or 10 years the internet will be dependable enough and low enough latency that we don’t rely on local processing as much. If that’s the case Apple will lose their chip advantage to some extent as it will become less important to have local processing speed. \n\nConsumer price fatigue/phones become “good enough” for longer periods of time - to some extent Apple is a victim of their own success. Their smartphones are aging increasingly well, and while in years past a 2 year old phone was practically unusable today an iPhone 6s is still fine. That naturally limits demand for their yearly smartphone. As I mentioned before I am not sure if we hit it yet, but the iPhone X miiiiight be hitting the ceiling of what consumers realistically want to pay for a phone, especially since their old phone is aging better than ever.\n\nAI: total wild card but Apple isn’t likely to do well here. The privacy they offer is unfortunately going to limit the raw data they can process on remote sites. If it can be done locally this is a non-issue but otherwise they’re at a disadvantage. Apple is generally somewhat secretive but the AI field is small enough if they were hiring remotely aggressively it would have been spotted from 1000 miles away.\n\nSide note: deep mind (from google) is legit insane. I only really “believe” their claims. Watson is effectively a fake, despite their fancy promotions. There is a non-trivial chance google experiences truly insane growth, however I think the upside is limited by potential government intervention. \n\nOverall I think Apple is solid, and in the event of a market downturn it’s one of the stocks I would pick up because paradoxically it seems to be a luxury good people buy in spite of reduced spending power. I guess unlike cars a new iPhone is a realistic “goal” for people, even if they’re poor. Especially now they are monthly payments.
