They've been through iterations of management, with their founder and CEO leaving, and they are better for it.  Can you say the same of Amazon if Bezos were to leave?

An example of this is WalMart and Target recently announcing that they are dropping AWS in favor of other cloud platforms.  \n\nMicrosoft has been able to adopt to a world where open source software is the norm.
