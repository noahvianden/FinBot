I don't think the earnings were bad as much as I think this is a stock that has run considerably in part because I think people want to be a part of the brand and with Ferrari's exclusivity and managing the brand, even people with the money are often told no when it comes to buying one. At this point in the stock's run, priced for great, earnings merely good.\n\n\"The most difficult part of my job is to say no... At the very beginning you receive applications from people who do not deserve, they simply have the money. 'I am the king of something, so I deserve the car,'\" said Galliera. \"I say 'Yes, but you are not a Ferrari client.'\"\n\n\"That's the easy part. Then you have someone who is still a very good customer but is not in the top 200, and I cannot offer him the car. Normally most of them understand… some of them that are not used to hearing 'no' keep asking. The most difficult part of my job is when I join an event and the person is there, and he becomes hard headed, and he locks onto me and keeps asking and asking.\" (http://www.thedrive.com/news/12689/ferrari-employees-are-not-allowed-to-buy-their-own-cars-from-the-factory)\n\nFerrari manages the brand to a degree that is genuinely extraordinary and I think that's one of the things that I find most attractive about the story.\n\n\"\"I think it has been confirmed by the performance of the stock in the marketplace, but more importantly the financial performance we've had since we've taken it [the company] public, that Ferrari as you know it isn't a car-maker,\" CEO Marchionne said. **\"Ferrari happens to make cars, but it makes luxury goods for a select group of people who cherish belonging to an exclusive club for our users -- that's a different argument than making cars.\"** (https://www.thestreet.com/story/14337080/1/ferrari-sales-of-supercars.html)\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla is being run like the world's largest kickstarter. This thing about taking deposits - hey,good for Tesla that they have made that successful. I hope Tesla stays around because these people sending in $250,000 deposits for Roadsters are going to be SOL if Tesla runs out of money between now and then - you're an unsecured creditor in that situation. Musk's promises are not being met - says going to be making X amount of Model 3's, the date comes around and we suddenly find out that they're being made by hand and there's 84% less of them being made than thought. Additionally, for a brand like Tesla where it's all about being sleek, I've read way more complaints about fit and finish quality control problems than I should.\n\nSo, nothing against Tesla but I just think there's too many red flags. Meanwhile, Ferrari has been one of the most extraordinarily finely, tightly managed luxury brands for 70 years now. I own it, I don't think about it day-to-day really; I can very easily see owning RACE 5-10+ years from now.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-24/tesla-s-newest-promises-break-the-laws-of-batteries\n\"Elon Musk touted ranges and charging times that don’t compute with the current physics and economics of batteries.\"\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-21/tesla-is-blowing-through-8-000-every-minute-amid-model-3-woes\n\"Over the past 12 months, the electric-car maker has been burning money at a clip of about $8,000 a minute (or $480,000 an hour), Bloomberg data show.

", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks. I'm not saying that Elon isn't very smart (he is), but maybe as someone who's a bit older and more cynical,  I can't be, \"Elon's gonna save the world, I'm sure he has a plan.\" I look at his tweets (which I think he should be more careful about - there's starting to become too many tweets like his tweet in July that they would be producing 20,000 Model 3's a month by December. They're producing a fraction of that and by hand. I can't imagine that in July, Musk wasn't aware of the reality that the ability to produce 20,000 cars 5 months later would not be there.\n\nThe tweet the other day about adding rockets to the Roadster. People get very hyped - Elon is certainly a skilled hype man - but this is a 53B company. It can't be run like the world's largest kickstarter campaign. It's impressive that they are getting 250K deposits for the Roadster, but it's astonishing to me because those people are effectively giving Tesla a no interest loan for probably 4-5+ years and they are unsecured creditors. Tesla basically says in the fine print, \"We gonna use your money in the meantime.\" (Example from the Model 3 Agreement: \"You\tunderstand that\twe\twill\tnot\thold\tyour\tReservation\tPayment\tseparately\tor\tin\tan\tescrow\tor\ttrust\tfund\tor\tpay\t\nany\tinterest\ton\tyour\tReservation\tPayment.\t\"\n\nMusk's Space X, Boring Company and other projects are a distraction. Some people have thought that Musk will leave Tesla in a few years for SpaceX. As for the Boring Company, Musk sold $300K in hats for that. Dude must be laughing to himself. \n\nIt's not bad to invest in things that you find exciting. I'm not saying that at all, in fact if anything I'm telling you that people SHOULD invest in things that excite and interest them. I don't invest in something I don't give a shit about. But look at Jen-Hsun Huang of Nvidia. That is a business doing extraordinarily well and lead by someone who - if you watch them or listen to them - has an almost remarkably singular focus.  There's no \"ums or uhs\", Jen-Hsun Huang has his vision and it's crystal clear - he gives detailed, insightful answers combined with a tremendously \"matter of fact\" delivery. Tesla's conference calls do not inspire the same level of confidence.\n\nThis doesn't even get into how Musk/Tesla handle the press or anyone who doesn't speak positively of Tesla. That is a real red flag and has been in the past for other companies. It's almost oddly defensive. With things like the quality control issues that I see so much of about on Tesla online, that's just not acceptable and I can't just hope that \"Oh Elon gonna fix it.\" It's just not acceptable from a brand standpoint to read that: \"The analyst found a misalignment in the Model 3's glass roof, body panel gaps, rubber trim issues around windows and misaligned seams in the interior ceiling of the car, according to his note.\n\n\"Our inspection revealed widespread shortcomings in fit and finish ... Tesla representatives acknowledged some of the fit issues, but stated that they believed that Model 3 was much further ahead than where Model X and S had been at this point in production,\" he wrote.\n\n\"We do find the statements credible, we can't help noting that Tesla likely chose to share with us its highest quality/best assembled units, so issues on other cars may be even more pronounced.\" (https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/10/bernstein-analyst-finds-tesla-model-3s-fit-and-finish-relatively-poor-after-test-drive.html)\n\nThat kind of stuff is not acceptable when you have a brand like this and I don't think that's being overly negative, it's just being realistic. Tesla is a high-end brand and no high-end brand wants to get to the point where it's associated with such issues.\n\nI have nothing in particular against Tesla, but I think maybe I'm just older and more cynical and can't simply go, \"Well, Trust in Elon\"", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What do they do?

If it wants to keep slow treking upwards I'll still hold, but in my mind my target has been trigerred and I'll sell on the first red day basically.\n\nResistance lines and upper band I am much more critical of, if it hits either of those in a sluggish manner I'll usually sell immediately because I find there are harsher sell offs if a stock turns bearish at these levels, and like I said, I hate losing profits.
