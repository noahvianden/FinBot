{"title": "I believe $T is a good buy , 50$ by 2019", "selftext": "I mean yeah that's a lot of debt and people keep saying blah blah people are cord cutting , TV industry is doomed blah blah but people are cutting cord cause they are moving to internet TV ( cheaper with more content ) same way people moved from landline phone to wireless , but imagine , $T with the end user DirectTV NOW and the contents from $TWX to offer at some loss to grow their user base, then eventually lure them into getting their wireless and internet and steal customers from other telecom ( since the wireless market is saturated) that's why the DOJ wants to block the merger even though technically its a vertical merger. Like he mentioned a few times , they are into a bundling business , bundle phone with internet , or bundle or bundle cable tv with internet . I mean if $T says hey if you move your wireless and internet to us we throw a direct TV time warner top of the shit package for only 9.99$ ( even though the content cost 30$ they can still turn a decent profit through targeted ADs technology), I would be like fk yeah , then I cancel my crappy netflix that I am paying 12$ for and move all my services to $T . This will allow them to get so big that other parties cant compete with them , hence the DOJ situation. now look whats going on , everyone is trying to buy a media company lol but ATT&T is way ahead of them. don't forget IoT connected cars , targeted ads ( huge potential here , first and only one ) and eventually throw you pay per view etc..), the 5G network.. they are way ahead of other 3 telecoms in every way . This is a really good buy and hold , very good future unless we get in a reccession or correction , this will be a 45 to 60$ in 2 years or less. Im thinking about buying 2019 , 2020 LEAP and an OTM calls like 50$ 60$ for a multi bagger.\nLDRT $T is a giant sleeping beast and will conquer the world if the TWX merger goes through .", "id": "7dwq1h", "created_utc": 1511048417.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "Didn't read any of this.", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": "I can't read.
