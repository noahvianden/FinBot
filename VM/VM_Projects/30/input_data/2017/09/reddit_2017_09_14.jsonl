JNJ is going through similar growing pains right now with one of their drugs that had generics released a year or two ago.  If JNJ can do it, I believe that ABBV can as well.

A class shares are subject to 15% tax on dividend and slightly cheaper, but if you are in the US in a taxable brokerage, you can write the taxes off so you do not get double taxed.  B class are not taxed, which are preferred for tax deferred accounts.
