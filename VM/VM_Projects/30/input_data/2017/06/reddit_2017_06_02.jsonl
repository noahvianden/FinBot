I like to do comparative analysis to other tech companies, because that's what I'm good at, and I've been able to beat the market that way. I'll let the hedge fund managers pour over the financials. I just pick tech products/companies I think will grow. It was pretty obvious growing up that Apple/Google/Amazon would dominate the future global economy. But I didn't have the earning power to make gains on that prediction. Nowadays, I'm putting bets in NVDA/TSLA in the same way I would have put bets in AAPL/AMZN/GOOGL if I were 10 years older.\n\nFor me, one of my investing theses is that NVIDIA will be one of the 10-20 biggest companies in the world by market cap, by 2030. Now, I look at how big the market cap of the current top 10-20 companies is, and factor in a 7% annual growth rate (or a bit more since I also believe the top tech companies will outgrow the market in an increasingly globalized world). This gives me a market cap target for 2030 for NVIDIA of, say $1T (for easy math). This gives me a price target for NVDA for 2030 (be sure to factor in another 13 years of dilution). From there, in the same way, I can determine intermediate price targets based on my predicted rate of increase for the stock price.\n\nAnother way to think of it: Suppose you think NVIDIA will be worth about 1/3 what google is worth. Google current market cap is ~600B, so in the future you would expect NVIDIA to be worth ~200B in today's dollars. From that, you can determine it is a good long-term buy/hold since NVDA market cap < 1/3 * GOOGL market cap.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks a ton. Very helpful.
