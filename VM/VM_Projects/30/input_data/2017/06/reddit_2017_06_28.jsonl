I am guessing it will be bullish tuesday in anticipation.  \n[6/27] We started the day up 4% but lost momentum and ended up closing with almost no loss from prior close.  \n  \n$COST  \n[6/26] If it is up tuesday, it will be bullish wed and thursday  \n[6/27] It didn’t go up and RSI hasn’t crossed above 30 yet. Keep waiting for RSI to start going up more.  \n  \n$CRR  \n[6/26] Should go up Tuesday  \n[6/27] I was right! We closed up 9%! RSI is going up. It is about to cross above 50 which is a great sign. Bullish trend to continue for a while. If it goes above RSI 50 then the next target price is $9.34  \n  \n$ADMP  \n[6/26] Should drop a small amount  \n[6/27] I was right! Down 3% today and trend looks to continue bearish  \n  \n$TGT  \n[6/26] ? If it crosses StochRSI above 20 then stock should rise wednesday  \n[6/27] StochRSI did cross above 20, yay! RSI14 looks good too, still moving up. Stock should go up the next few days a small amount. If RSI14 crosses above 50 then we will see a steady rise up to $58.  \n  \n$XXII  \n[6/26] Will drop Tuesday. Look for support at $1.64  \n[6/27] I was right! We ended over 3% down  \n  \n$NG  \n[6/26] Earning supposed to be released soon. Guessing we will be bullish Tuesday  \n[6/27] I was right! We ended over 4.5% higher  \n  \n$KBH  \n[6/26] Earnings coming out Tuesday night. If earnings are good big jump wednesday  \n[6/27]  \n  \n$HALO  \n[6/26] Will drop tuesday from $14.60 down to $14.25 and continue bearish down to $13.50  \n[6/27] I was right! And almost got the price right too. Down today to $14.00  \n  \n$DRI  \n[6/26] Bullish tuesday based on RSI numbers in my charts  \n[6/27] I was right! Up 3% today  \n  \n$DXTR  \n[6/26] Support at .183, resistance at .32, stock going to drop Tuesday  \n[6/27] I was wrong on this one! Up 31% today. Penny stocks suck. The up was just on volume, not news. BUT, we crossed the important .32 resistance. I am not really sure, but I think maybe next target is around $0.69 ?  \n  \n$DCTH  \n[6/26] Another penny stock. Key price point is $0.22, if we close above .22 the next target is .30  \n[6/27] No change today, hanging on tight to the .22 price level  \n  \n$CVNA  \n[6/26] Bullish for Tuesday. It is overbought, but has a chance to continue up. Its above 20 SMA  \n[6/27] I missed the mark on this one. It triggered my stop loss and sold all my shares at $23 this morning. Down 5% today. After I re-analyze the charts today I see my mistake. Oops  \n  \n$IYC  \n[6/26] Should go up on Tuesday  \n[6/27] I was wrong, it was down 1/2% today.  \n  \nTLDR; I made predictions on 14 stocks. Got 3 of them wrong, one of which is a penny stock. Penny stocks are dumb. I got 6 of them absolutely correct, and the others we need some more info before I can tell if I was right or wrong.\n\n[Here is the original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/6jpnuz/my_bets_for_tuesday_mu_cost_crr_admp_tgt_xxii_ng/)\n\n\n", "id": "6jwubl", "created_utc": 1498608027.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "Where did you learn to evaluate stocks like that?", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Last week I started googling and reading about different patterns, how to use the 14 day RSI, how to read and understand candle charts, etc. Watched some videos on youtube too.
