Should I wait until they expire?  Are there any risks to this?  Can I just let both expire, take an automatic loss and not worry about it, or should I close the position beforehand?   \n\nI use etrade - do they take care of everything automatically if I let both expire?\n\nHere's my trade:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0D1UEZR.png\n\n", "id": "6mgmv6", "created_utc": 1499713687.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "You're new to options, your first put spread and you do the following:\n\n1. Trade a large / whipsaw-capable stock like TSLA\n2. You sell 10 contracts\n\nHmm, well I won't go into the rant of yelling at you for this but I am concerned about your choice of stock and size -- not to mention not having a plan before hand.\n\nAnyhow, let's get to answering your questions..\n\nFirst, the spread is not at max loss (yet) -- it's trading around $2.26.  Considering, it appears, you collected $0.70 -- your loss is around $1.56 x 10 (not including commissions) if you close it out now for $1560 loss.  \n\nSo, the question is really, are you still bullish on the stock?  If you are then you can stick with.  I mean, you only have $0.24 more cents to lose per contract to take the chance that it may recover.  Up to you...\n\nIf you let both sides expires ITM, then your broker should exercise / assign (but please call them to confirm) then you would effectively be at the $2.50 debit + assignment and exercise fees.  If you did stay in the trade up to this point (expiration), then I, personally, would close for max loss on the day of expiration to avoid those assignment and exercise fees which would be $10 or $20 per strike.\n\nSo you have option to wait and see if it recovers or just close out now (although risk to holding isn't much considering how deep it is in the money).\n\nSome would say that selling the oppositve call spread which requires no additional capital turning this into an Iron Condor / Iron Fly may be worth it but it looks like it's trading very cheap and probably not worth it.\n\nI think the ship has sailed on this, you should have managed this trade much earlier.\n\nA few words of advise for next time:\n\n1. Manage / defend earlier\n2. Lower your size, 10 contracts is insane for new option traders\n3. Trade more stable underlyings because based on your questions, it seems like you're very new and have no idea how to defend a trade let alone the ramifications (the outcomes) of the trade you're in.\n\nI hope you take this constructively.
