I don't know what the price of RNG is, but if we assume $3/gal, that's $1.5billion in revenue before any shares are purchased. Now let's take a gander at the TTM revenue numbers of CLNE...they made just $282 million revenue over the past 12 months. In other words, Amazon would have to roughly 5x CLNE's annual revenues in the next 12 months in order to start buying any CLNE stock in the next year.\n\nAlso note: I have not fact checked OP's statement here, but I hope it's true.\n\nEarnings in August I'm honestly expecting to be a nothing burger from a numbers perspective. Probably coming out to about break even or close to it (though ideally on the positive side). They will continue to expand their network and their production capacity. What I'm interested in is to see if they announce any new deals and if they give any more details on progress of existing deals. I'm hoping to see some signs of progress as we head towards the latter half of this year into next.\n\nAmazon isn't the be all end all, but it is a huge deal to expedite their vision. Hopefully CLNE will prove that RNG is a viable option for their long haul truck fleet over any of the other options they're looking at. Let's look at EV as an example...\n\nTesla semi doesn't really exist yet, much less their mega chargers that supposedly can charge the battery to 400 miles in 30 minutes. Don't forget a semi's job is to haul a lot of weight. Batteries will cut into a significant portion of that weight capacity, limiting the potential revenue of the truck per load. Not to mention the cost of buying the truck + the cost of replacing the battery. EV car batteries might last \\~10 years, but if we say a truck drives 400 miles a day and works 241 days (365 days - 104 weekend days because we'll assume trucks don't drive on weekends - 20 days vacation because we'll assume truck drivers take a month of vacation = 241), that's 80% of an EV car battery life (guessing 10yrs at avg 12k miles per year = 120k miles) in 1 year instead of 10. So...buy an EV truck for \\~200k, replace battery in one year because range is getting tight...\\~50k? (it's 10-15k to replace battery in a tesla car I think). 50k...that's 15k gallons of diesel (avg $3.25/gal), which is worth \\~107k miles at 7mpg. Oh crap...I can drive more on diesel than I can on the COST of my EV truck battery, not including the cost of the electricity, the opportunity cost of the battery weight that I can't haul as revenue generating freight, or the opportunity cost of driving instead of waiting hours for my truck to charge.\n\nSo...let's summarize the \"value\" proposition of an EV truck:\n\n* 200k initial cost\n* 50k annual battery replacement (total guess, but normal tesla car battery replacement runs around 15k on a random google search result, or about 33% of extended range model 3. 200k\\*.3 = 60k - 10k to be conservative = 50k), which is already over 100k diesel miles before paying for charging.\n* ? cost of charging\n* opportunity cost of hauling 0 revenue battery instead of revenue generating freight\n* opportunity cost of spending potentially hours charging instead of hauling (400mi range/ 60mph = 6.67 hours driving of an 11hr limit in a 14hr period (Tesla has not proven the mega-charger 30 minute charge capability yet).\n* Avg trucker salary = .40 cents per mile (on the high end per google), which equates to roughly 62.4k per year if they work without vacations (again per google, not using any numbers from above...my math may not be as conservative as I thought).\n\nEDIT: I'm sure some number I used above is wrong...I didn't do any double checking...that's for you to do and down-vote me for being an idiot smooth brain donkey.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Nice work on the numbers. I essentially came to the same conclusion as well, that for distances greater than 400km ($LEV basically admits that's the max range on their trucks) up to 400miles that there's not much alternative available right now to go green until either electric gets better/faster AND gets more infrastructure (cause where are ALL those semis supposed to charge?) or hydrogen gets developed, both of which are a ways away right now.\n\nThe only thing that might persuade are HEAVY subsidies. If I'm dropping money on an asset at n=0 (today) I'm going to want to generate cashflows as soon and as frequently as possible by having that truck doing generating cash. Waiting for it to sit somewhere while charging is a huge detriment there.\n\nThat being said though, RNG seems the way to go from an Ops standpoint due to less downtime on the asset and/or infrastructure is easier to support e.g. easier and faster to gas up on RNG vs. building out a network of thousands of \"battery swapping\" stations.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Didn’t PLUG tank over cooking their books?", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}]}
