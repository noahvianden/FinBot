They are literally telling you point blank that they are going to crush Crypto.  They have never worked together like this before.\n\nTheir reasons are clear,  the anonymous nature of transactions leads crypto to organized crime and simply makes it too easy to hide revenue from the Government.  All Governments are worried about loosing tax revenue as a result of cryptocurrency transactions.\n\nThey are attacking crypto along several fronts.\n\n1) Regulation.  Bring crypto exchanges into the current regulatory environment.  To crypto idiots, this looks like the establishment is finally going to adopt crypto. What it really does is setup legal arguments for the shutdown of these exchanges.  Why? Because there isn’t a crypto exchange on the planet that can meet organized crime regulations. They can’t, because crypto can’t be traced. \n\n2) the introduction of regulated crypto currency controlled by the central bank. This is competition, designed to remove any sort of public backlash from the imminent removal of crypto as any possibility as a currency of transaction, and pushes crypto to the fringes of use. It also reduces crypto to a single purpose, as an asset exchange between official currencies.  This removes any sort of demand for crypto by replacing it with something the establishment Iikes.  Once this is introduced, the closing of unregulated coins in exchanges will start.  This is where crypto exchanges will only be able to sell you those coins that meet organized crime regulation requirements.  Neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum will ever meet those requirements. \n\n3) the new crypto does advance currency transactions.  The Feds new digital currency for instance has the capability to simply make credit cards obsolete.  That’s quite a shift in the industry. It will make waves. The waves will be all about this new crypto coin and how amazing it is for online transactions that are no longer hemorrhaging revenue to credit companies. This is where Bitcoin and Ethereum should have been.. but they’ll never be allowed to get there, Central bank heads have said this already, very explicitly.  “Bitcoin will never be used as a currency for transactions”.  <=== Google this, and see who said it.   While stability is important, that’s not the primary reason, although it’s an often used excuse. The primary reason is about control.  Currency use has always been about control. \n\n\nCathy Wood, and Elon Musk are not in a position to influence policy around the world, and they are not large enough forces to overcome the establishment with respect to the use of currencies.  These are not the people who can protect your money if what I described comes to pass. \n\nIt’s your money.  I just felt I had to warn you.

If Mercedes wants to go all electric by 2030 and can't keep batteries in stock, Tesla wins by default. \n\n2. Iteration and Updates. Right now, Tesla isn't great at making structural changes to existing designs. The Model 3 could benefit from a single-piece rear casting, but to retool for that would cause Tesla to miss delivery estimates. They're too busy making cars to improve cars. They need to find a way out of that so that they can build the Model 3 2.0 like they are with the Model S and X. Taking a long time off 3/Y production would be huge for them, so it's something they have to solve. The fit/finish on the new Model S is reputed to be outstanding and could help Tesla compete against rivals from BMW, Mercedes, etc, \n\n3. AutoPilot/FSD. They need a clearer path of intermediate steps to FSD. Competitors are talking about releasing true Level 3 for low-speed highway driving (traffic jams.) If you've used the current production software you know that it could almost certainly do that with very few improvements required. Why not beat the competition to market?

I am going to state exactly how I would use $5,000 in these current market conditions.\n\n· **Going long on GME (GameStop) and AMC (Movie Theater) Stock**\n\no Test water for a few days, watch for strength or weakness\n\no GME Key Buy Levels: $152, $139, and $115\n\no AMC Key Buy Levels: $30, and $24\n\no If showing strength and has above average trade volume, will start position at current   \nmarket price\n\no Predicting another move up in both soon\n\no **$1000** will be invested in both GME and AMC for a total of **$2,000** in long stock\n\n· **Trading options in SPY (S&P 500 ETF), IWM (Russell 2000 ETF), and possibly IJR (Small-Cap ETF)**\n\no **Option Types:**\n\n§ **Call –** Assuming the underlying asset will achieve a **higher price** by a specific date\n\n§ **Put** – Assuming the underlying asset will fall to a **lower price** by a specific date\n\n§ Trading options are very risky, but with great risk comes great reward if correct\n\no **SPY is currently trading at an overvalued all-time high.**\n\n§ I am speculating that a market correction will occur anywhere between August 20th and   \nearly to mid-September.\n\n§ Catalysts that could trigger correction:\n\n· Covid-19 Delta Variant\n\n· MSM spreading mass hysteria\n\n· Unemployment/stimulus benefits ending = less consumer spending\n\n· Commercial/Individual Real Estate market collapse (reminiscent of 2008)\n\n· Online Currency Bubble\n\n· The Fed intervening, to help slow inflation by slowing down the money machine\n\n· Hedge Funds that got caught illegal short-selling stocks like GME and AMC will no longer   \nbe able to sustain retail buying pressure.\n\n· Short Hedge Funds will be margin called and forced to buy back shares, thus being forced   \nto liquidate other positions to free up cash\n\n§ I would spread out a series of SPY Put Options for dates from Aug. 20th going into   \nSeptember\n\n§ These long puts would not exceed **$500**, but may be bought/sold over time\n\n§ If market correction happens before these dates, it would substantially increase my   \nprofitability on the put options. Vice-versa, if the market does not correct and continues bull   \nrun past September, all put options would expire worthless.\n\no **IWM is currently trading about 15 points under all-time high.**\n\n§ IWM contains 8.84 million shares of AMC\n\n§ IWM contains 1.34 million shares of GME\n\n§ I would buy IWM Call Options dating Aug. 20th going into September\n\n§ These long calls would not exceed **$500**, but may be bought/sold over time\n\no **IJR is currently trading about 8 points under all-time high.**\n\n§ IJR contains 3.65 million shares of GME\n\n§ Would watch price action for potential swing trade on high volume\n\n§ No more than **$500** would be used\n\no **I use these three ETFs to get the most bang for my buck.**\n\n§ If market corrects/crashes and AMC and GME begin to see massive price increases I would   \nstand to greatly benefit from owning options in them before it all starts.\n\n· **Use the remaining balance to utilize quick day/swing trades.**\n\no Assuming the plan starts to fall into place, I would have already invested a maximum **$3,500**.\n\n§ **$2,000** in AMC and GME stock\n\n§ **$1,500** in various ETF call/put options\n\no The remaining **$1,500** would be kept as cash on hand for quick trades\n\n§ During times of volatile market conditions, many good day trades can present themselves.\n\n§ It is good to have cash on hand to be able to seize any opportunities if they present   \nthemselves.\n\n· **Potential profits vs losses**\n\no If market correction occurs after my projected date of August 20th – September 20th, all SPY Put Options would expire worthless. **-$500**\n\no If market continues current bull run and AMC/GME stay stagnant, IWM and IJR Calls would likely break even or see minor gains/losses. **$1,000 +/- $250 (-$750 – +$1,250)**\n\no If market continues current bull run and AMC/GME price sees a dramatic increase, IWM and IJR Calls could see profits of **+%500 - %5,000** based how soon it happens.  **(+$2,500 - $25,000)**\n\no If market corrects or crashes sooner than August 20th, the SPY Put Options could see profits up to roughly **+%100 - %20,000** based on timing of the initial downturn.  **(+$1,000 - $100,000)**\n\no **Worst Case Scenario** – Market stays stagnant as whole. No real movement in overall price through August and into September. AMC and GME crash down to new lows during that same time frame.\n\n§ This would likely cause all call/put options to expire near worthless **(\\*\\*\\*\\*-$1,000 - $1,500)**\n\n§ AMC and GME positions would have depreciated heavily as well.\n\n· Call it a **%75** decrease overall, leaving the value of long positions at **$500** representing a   \nloss of **$1,500.**\n\n§ **$1,500** used for day trades proves unsuccessful and creates net loss of **%75**.\n\n· This leaves **$375** left representing a loss of **$1,125**\n\n§ Overall loss would end at **$4,125** by Mid-September\n\no **Best Case Scenario** – Market crashes sooner than anticipated, all while hedge funds are margin called causing AMC and GME to see big surges in volume causing massive price increases.\n\n§ This would likely lead to all ETF call/put options to see the high end of possible percent gains.\n\n· Call it **+%1,000** overall, on the low end, representing a gain of **$15,000**.\n\n· Much higher percent gains are possible based on timing, and how bad the crash is\n\n§ AMC and GME positions could be sold for profit\n\n· AMC sold at $100/share\n\n· GME sold at $1,000/share\n\n· Total $ amount gained would remain to be seen on what it was initially bought at, but this   \nwould roughly equate to a **+%200-300** gain on both at their current market price.\n\n§ **$1,500** used for day trades were executed successfully throughout the allotted time frame   \nand creates net gain of **+%500.**\n\n· This would total **+$5,000** on the original **$1,500**, netting you +**$7,500** total\n\n§ Overall profit would end around **$25,000**, with even more upside potential depending on how   \nhard the market crashes and how much AMC and GME go up.\n\nEDIT 1: Format was trash and not financial advice", "id": "orvmod", "created_utc": 1627293551.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.46, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|4|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Lol wtf is this", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "The perfect comment for this post…subtle and to the point.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "I think he starts with saying he likes the stock,  then goes on to say buy and hold, finishing with not financial advice.\n\nBut I'm not 100% sure, I can't read.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Seems like there is math or whatever, i bought some.
