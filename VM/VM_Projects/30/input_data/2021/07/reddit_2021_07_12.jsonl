If the second case is true, the level of progress is definitely not as significant (er…..”mind-blowing”…) as an optimist would hope.\n\n- The methods by which failure occurs are a bit baffling and also worrying. I’ve seen (in the videos available) a few instances of sudden, unexplainable wheel-jerking into traffic, veering towards solid objects, and “intent vectors” that periodically don’t follow the map guidance. While it’s true that this probably is a heavy re-write (and it may also be true that the percentage of time disengagements happen is lower), these types of failures strike me as more of fundamental hardware + NN limitations rather than “pound more data into it and it’ll be fine”-types of issues.\n\nAll of the above to say: I’m not convinced such a drastic decrease in valuation is warranted based on a few videos and without allowing some time to optimize the vision-only setup, but remember that “Level 5” is supposed to be here by year’s end.

Assuming the hardware is fine as is, then in some local areas where there is lots of usage of the software the system might be able to refine the software to tackle that area within the year.

{"title": "Alight - Strong Moat, Full Service Provider, High Switching Cost, Necessary Service, and Business Process As a Service Dollars", "selftext": "**Background Information:**\n\nAlight is a benefits service provider that covers a spectrum of services in the space both in the U.S. and worldwide. It does 1) Health administration, 2) Healthcare Navigation, 3) Medicare Enrollment (For retiring people without pensions) 4) Wealth Administration, 5) Cloud Payroll, 6) Global Payroll, and 7) HCM Cloud Advisory and Deployment. In short it covers the full spectrum of the benefits service package, which **no one has ever done before (even though it seems like a no brainer, which means it's competing in a fragmented space, offers better integration, has cross-selling opportunity, and can save their clients time while increasing gross and net profit margins).** Don't believe me? Take a look at page 11 here:  [Welcome to a new way forward (q4cdn.com)](https://s27.q4cdn.com/164107266/files/doc_presentations/ALIT_Deck-for-Investor-Meetings_final_06-14-21.pdf). They serve 70+% of fortune 100 companies, and over half the Fortune 500! The NAV of WPF which Alight merged with on July 6 was 10.70, but the company trades at 9.72, and it traded as low as 8.85 after the merger.\n\n**Earnings Expectations:**\n\nIn an investor presentation update, Alight has already stated they are already modestly ahead of expectations on revenue and adjusted EBITDA because of strong booking growth. They have a strong product pipeline, and are also converting their revenue to BPAAS revenues which hold higher gross margins.\n\n**M&A**\n\nThey have a strong acquisition streak, and their most recent one which was announced recently was the Aon Retiree Health Exchange for America, which complements their Choice Health Program. The deal terms were beneficial because Aon sold it as they are trying to get their M&A with Willis Towers approved and they have an anti trust trial they need to get through.\n\n**Product Pipeline in the 2nd Half of 2021**\n\n* **Next Gen Health Wealth and Payroll Cloud**\n* **Mobile First Workplace App Going For Live Enrollment in the Fall**\n\n**The Numbers:**\n\nThey had 96% revenue retention last year to this year, and an average of 15 year client tenure for their top 25 customers by revenue. They're also diversified by field, as companies from all segments need the services provided by Alight. 81% of their revenue is recurring (Subscription), while the rest is project based, and the CEO is trying to increase subscription revenues. They also expect 50% BPAAS revenue by 2023, which give higher margins, and the bundled health benefit BPAAS offers 50% more annual recurring revenue benefits.\n\nThey also have strong FCF and net leverage at a 3x ratio, which means they can pursue M&A safely to grow, and it's helpful that there are a large, fragmented and global pool of acquisition targets. With Bill Foley's experience, they'll be able to hone in on the best acquisition targets, since he will become the chairman.\n\nThese services can be integrated, and cross-sold, which Alight has already done with its current acquisitions as well.\n\nThey are looking to get 60%+ gross margin long term, and 40%+ by FYE 2023. Adjusted EBITDA Margin should be 24% in 2023.\n\nExpected BPAAS Revenues (NOT TOTAL BOOKINGS) are 363M 2021E, 509M 202E, and 743M by 2023E. You can see their expectation for how much of that BPAAS revenue will comprise in the deck, but to sum it up it's 13, 17, 23%. In addition to margins, BPAAS will accelerate implementation and revenue recognition from the current 12-18 months to 6-9 months.\n\nTotal Revenue in 2021 is expected to be 2.76B in 2021, 2.945B in 2022, and 3.235B in 2023.\n\nFree Cash Flow for 2021 is expected to be 465M, 493M in 2022, and 607M in 2023. Which means they can easily service the 300M bond in 2025, and the 1.976B Term Loan in 2026. I know they referenced potentially getting the terms changed so they pay a lower interest rate, but I'm not sure if they will.\n\nRegardless after the merger, they received 360M to the balance sheet.\n\nThe best part of all this is that they are expected to have net income (excluding tax affected shareholder based compensation at a tax rate of 26% in 2021-2023E) of 9M at the end of 2021. This includes a one time 76M charge to extinguish their debt post merger, and one time restructuring costs regarding the merger which impact 2021 earnings for 44M. It also includes IT Optimus Investments which will run through 2021 and 2022 and can be found on page 20 of the slide deck. Finally intangible amortization is 201M, and Depreciation is 112M.\n\nThey expect Net income of 221M at the end of 2023.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThere are a few AMAZING gems in the shit pile that is SPACS. This one is my favorite, and I expect a 200% return in 2-3 years, because of the stickiness of the model and the cross-sell opportunities that this company has as a full service provider (the only one) for employee benefits and retirement. I was thinking of doing another one in a week for another SPAC company that is merging that are good, but I need to acquire a strong enough stake in them first.\n\nFor Alight, I bought 2 7.5 Calls at an average of 2.43 for Feb 2022 which are nearly in the money. I had hoped to buy more, but with nearly 10K tied in options on both Cannae and CCS I felt constricted by risk management, and so that's what I put in. I also have 523 shares in the company. I had talked in the yacht club about this company for a few days now, and there was a point (before today, and yesterday) where you could have bought the 7.5 calls for Feb and had a breakeven below 9.90-9.95, which is ridiculous considering the NAV price was 10.70, and most SPACS are priced at 10.\n\nThis is the type of company with the moat, growth, and operating margins (That are expanding) that I want. The CEO is a rockstar if you look him up. There's a strong board, and mergers and acquisitions have consistently been good. Strong FCF, quarterly execution that is coming out the gate strong with a slight beat already, and a clear path to GAAP profitability on a net income basis.\n\nHere you can find the CEO being interviewed on July 6th when the company officially went public:\n\n[Alight Solutions CEO Stephan Scholl on growth outlook post-SPAC merger - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-shhm07xj8)\n\n[Stephan Scholl, Alight CEO, on TD Ameritrade Network - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIXUkPvmabY)\n\n[Stephan Scholl, Alight CEO, on Bloomberg Markets - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwArNvm0qr4)\n\nEdit: Woops, let me show a SS as is proper with DD. \n\n [Merrill Edge - Account and 26 more pages - Personal - Microsoft​ Edge (gyazo.com)](https://gyazo.com/e66e17202842da99759eac29ee80c90e)  \n\n [ALIT $7.5 Call - $2.73 | Robinhood and 25 more pages - Personal - Microsoft​ Edge (gyazo.com)](https://gyazo.com/7ef5f51e0c8f037f0b0f1387f1469e11) ", "id": "oj15d6", "created_utc": 1626126059.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 40, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|22|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|409|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nv9hbb/cannae_the_bill_foley_company_thats_literally/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oj15d6/alight_strong_moat_full_service_provider_high/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n605e7/upcoming_uwmc_earnings_in_relation_to_ldi_rkt/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/md3080/uwmc_follow_through_the_mad_money_interview/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9x2bw/uwmc_my_final_dd_on_uwmc_in_light_of_q1_earnings/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx3sbz/dd_salesforce_due_diligence/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mpqxbf/my_update_on_uwmc_the_equivalent_of_counting/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m9frpz/enough_with_the_techno_mumbo_jumbo_a/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o3y8tf/ccs_the_company_making_a_shit_ton_of_cash/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwtg7n/ccslennar_like_good_god_ccs_is_making_me_hot_and/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/Hani95, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[https://gyazo.com/7ef5f51e0c8f037f0b0f1387f1469e11](https://gyazo.com/7ef5f51e0c8f037f0b0f1387f1469e11)\n\n[https://gyazo.com/e66e17202842da99759eac29ee80c90e](https://gyazo.com/e66e17202842da99759eac29ee80c90e)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "/u/pennyether, /u/OSRSkarma", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I do know everything pennyether posts immediately goes up so the algo’s obviously like him", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "It's more like me and him are brothers in arms on homebuilders lmao.

It offers monthly subscriptions and a personalized meal delivery service. It also offers custom collections through online marketplaces and brick-and-mortar retailers, like Amazon and Target. It collaborates with, and makes products for other brands like Subaru, Anheuser Busch, and Dunkin. It seeks to partner with dog owners throughout the dog’s entire life.\n\n[A 4\\/20 collaboration that sold out in minutes](https://preview.redd.it/z56nweks3va71.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a959c352eda5912670ba256a04814b436d6905c)\n\n*Play*\n\nBarkBox and Superchewer are subscription products featuring monthly themed boxes of toys and treats. Dog owners have the option to increase the number of toys and treats through the Add-to-Box offerings. The BarkBox includes 2 toys, 2 bags of treats, and a chew. Toys are designed in-house and tested by dogs before launch. A questionnaire allows the company to understand the needs of specific dogs so each box is designed for the dog(s) in mind. Specifically, it will collect information regarding breed, size, age, location, activities, play styles, toy preferences, and allergies.\n\n[Frank loves it](https://preview.redd.it/m04xtahw3va71.png?width=459&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b7b7f3b8ce95233061e37fbda65387c58275f93)\n\n*Food*\n\nBarkEats is a personalized, monthly meal plan for dogs. A nutritionist (Ph.D. Animal Nutritionist and Food Scientist) is consulted before developing the meal and dog owners can customize the food overtime to evolve with dogs’ dietary needs. Twenty-eight portioned meals are shipped to your home or P.O.

It contains a triple enzyme gel that is combined with dental chews to help with tartar accumulation and bad breath. This eliminates the task of brushing a dog’s teeth and provides an effective way to fight germs and bad breath. Other products included are flea and tick treatments with the plan to add health supplements in the future.\n\n[Toothbrush never included nor required](https://preview.redd.it/i19m7qh14va71.png?width=467&format=png&auto=webp&s=c78c8c961b8be6d71d1a3c8eba59c3ca6ed91cea)\n\n*Home*\n\nBarkHome offers a variety of products for daily life including beds, bowls, collars, harnesses, and leashes.

Commerce revenue increased by $6.5M due to an increase in retail ($1.5M) and BarkHome ($5M) revenue. The increases of each were from an increase in product offerings and penetration within the online marketplaces. Cost of direct to consumer revenue increased by $4.1M from costs associated with an increase in active subscriptions. The cost of commerce increased by $0.5M primarily due to costs associated with the number of goods delivered to retailers and online marketplaces. The gross profit as a percentage of revenue improved to 60.4% from 56% due to the increase in Add-to-Box revenue.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, direct to consumer revenue increased by $129.8M which was primarily driven by an increase in subscription shipments and Add-to-Box revenue which increased by $15.2M, from $2.4M to $17.5M. Commerce revenue increased by $24.5M which was primarily driven by retail and BarkHome revenue. Moreover, the introduction of products to new retail chains added to the retail revenue ($8.6M increase) and the increase in product offerings in the online marketplaces added to BarkHome revenue ($15.8M increase). Again, the cost of direct to consumer revenue increased due to consistent increase in direct to consumer revenue. Also, the cost of commerce increased primarily due to the costs associated with the number of goods delivered to new and existing retail customers. Direct to consumer gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to increased costs to inbound freight and royalty fees from license partnerships.\n\n[$ in thousands](https://preview.redd.it/1ixh8ya94va71.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7f381b211e50b0c5da0af84b1dbe56764b5310d)\n\nThe change in Adjusted EBITDA results from an increase in revenue and gross profit in direct to consumer and commerce in 2021. There was also a decrease in pricing for social media advertising due to the pandemic which led to lower advertising and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue. The change in Adjusted EBITDA margin is the result of a decrease in net loss margin which was attributed to increase in revenue and gross profit in 2021.\n\n# BULL ARGUMENT\n\nIn 2017, the American Kennel Club stated the cost of owning a dog from a puppy to senior years could range from $14.5K – $15.8K while Forbes estimated between $17.6K – $93.5K, depending on the size of the dog. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association in 2018, 48.2M or 38.4% of households in the United States owned dogs and the average number owned per household was 1.6 dogs.\n\nThe 2019-2020 American Pet Products Association National Pet Owners Survey showed 67% of U.S. households owned a pet which equates to 84.9M homes, 63.4M of which had dogs. The first year the survey was conducted (1988) showed 56% of U.S. households owned a pet.\n\nThe 2021 State of the Industry presentation on March 24, 2021 stated there are more pets today than pre-COVID which means more supplies – food, beds, collars, leashes, toys. As a result, there was an increase in demand and manufacturers could not produce quickly enough. COVID safety protocols meant enhanced cleaning, slowing machinery, and worker separation among other things. Add competition from Amazon (and other competitors) with enhanced benefits and compensation which made it hard to fill open positions for production workers. Supply chain challenges and shortages began February 2020 and demand surged in May for imported products. Some challenges continue today and are likely to continue through 2021 and into 2022 such as:\n\n* Ground transportation equipment shortages\n* Fewer ships/containers available\n* Container prices increased to 9-10K\n* West coast ports are jammed\n\nOverall, the demand is real and will not go away anytime soon. The increased costs for shipping and raw materials *will be passed along*. Demand from a country full of pent-up spending energy has pushed all three ports on the West Coast to record import levels over the past year. Of the pet owners in 2020, 47% reported they increased the number of times they purchased pet products online in 2020. Total retail sales were up 6.7% with 30% of pet owners spending more on their pet in the past year.\n\n[Size of the pet industry 2019 & 2020 \\($ in billions\\)](https://preview.redd.it/tj2gnx7c4va71.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=13da9a25c139c46707b11d45b073cfaf425e41fc)\n\nThe outlook for the pet industry for 2021 and 2022 is bullish. Additionally, the pet care market size is projected to expand at 6.1% CAGR from 2021 to 2027. This growth will be driven by an increase in animal healthcare expenditure, growing pet adoption, rising prevalence of food borne and zoonotic diseases, and increasing demand for protein in foods. The pet food segment accounted for $94.2B and the dog segment held a market share of 41%, or $96.5B, in 2020. E-commerce accounted for 17% of the revenue share in 2020 and is observed as a potential growth driver for the industry. Additionally, there is a growing shift towards premium food which is boosting industry demand. Changes in perception of animals, specifically dogs, in China and India will result in significant adoptions of dogs in the coming years. From 2015 to 2020, the worldwide relative search volume (RSV) for dog adoption peaked in April 2020.\n\n[The peak as indicated the rectangle was observed following the WHO declaration of the pandemic](https://preview.redd.it/fqpwfogm4va71.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf0b8b235e87dbff5a6d32acfec5d7cfd5e74151)\n\n# BEAR ARGUMENT\n\nIt only serves dog owners. This is a big one as it is leaving the rest of pet owners out leaving room for competitors to fill that section of the market. Of the previously mentioned 84.9M homes with pets:\n\n* Birds (5.7M homes)\n* Cats (42.7M homes)\n* Horses (1.6M homes)\n* Freshwater fish (11.5M homes)\n* Salt water fish (1.6M homes)\n* Reptile (4.5M homes)\n* Small mammal (5.4M homes)\n\n[Size of the pet industry 2021 \\($ in billions\\)](https://preview.redd.it/006cy73s4va71.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f7325e2124db76e63496f3f5f3a325869123041)\n\nOther areas of the market that are left untouched are medical/veterinary expenses. For instance, Veterinary Care and Product sales are estimated to grow $32.3B, or 3%, in 2021. Other services such as grooming, training, boarding, and walking/pet sitting will account for $9.7B, or a growth of 20%. Moreover, it is a newer company that is still developing the product line when it comes to health. In turn, it leaves a large chunk of the 6% growth for Supplies, Live and over-the-counter medications, as well as a portion of Product sales, up for grabs for competitors.\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nI am bullish over the next 12 months. What happens after that will be determined by its ability to expand the products that are offered across all four categories. The direct to consumer business is primarily comprised of subscription products that are tailored to different aspects of a dog's life. This will allow it to grow with the owners and dogs for years to come.\n\n[Within the last 4 weeks](https://preview.redd.it/zvj8c5nu4va71.png?width=524&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0742769c5b7f57ce150761b4b26ccacdd5f89b9)\n\n[As of 7\\/12\\/21, after hours, near the money. Expiry not listed: 7\\/16\\/21 & 2\\/18\\/22](https://preview.redd.it/6162si3z5va71.png?width=551&format=png&auto=webp&s=b448079f60de4efd8c4687f22135202a01973011)\n\nAdd the buy signals to the open interest over the next 4 months and that tells me there is confidence the share price will go up. If the 63M households in the U.S. with dogs are anything like me, they spoil the shit out of their dog(s). Given the forecast for the pet industry, I believe it will gain market share and amass a larger following via social media. With a current 8.7M followers on social media and over 12M email contacts, it is poised to grow.
