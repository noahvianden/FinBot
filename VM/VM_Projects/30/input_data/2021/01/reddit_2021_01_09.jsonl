{"title": "Long Term Options Watchlist on Financial Sector", "selftext": " \n\nThe [Financial Select Sector SPDR](https://www.barrons.com/quote/FUND/US/ARCX/XLF) exchange-traded fund (ticker: XLF) rose 4.4% on extraordinarily heavy volume. Banks that originate consumer loans and have institutional trading divisions—and which benefit from rising interest rates—surged even more. [Bank of America](https://www.barrons.com/quote/BAC) (BAC), [Citigroup](https://www.barrons.com/quote/C) (C), and [Morgan Stanley](https://www.barrons.com/quote/MS) (MS) each rose about 6%. [Wells Fargo](https://www.barrons.com/quote/WFC) (WFC) rose some 7%.\n\nThe financial sector seems to be in a proverbial sweet spot. Banks will make more money on loans if rates are higher and if markets keep lurching around like a drunk at a country club party. Price swings tend to prompt a lot of trading activity, and that creates business for bank trading desks.\n\nWith the Financial SPDR ETF at $30.50, investors can consider buying the June $32 [call option](https://www.barrons.com/articles/how-to-buy-and-sell-options-without-making-a-fool-of-yourself-51600336811?mod=article_inline) for $1.30. The position is an extremely simple wager that the financial sector continues to advance in an economic environment that is defined by inflation and increasingly accommodative fiscal policies. If the ETF is at $40 at the June expiration, the call would be worth $8. Should it fall below $33.30—the trade break-even—the wager is a failure.\n\nThe June $32 call purchase is such a simple approach that it will strike some investors as being almost devoid of risk. But the fact of the matter is that the trade is really an aggressive, albeit not particularly expensive, way to wager that the long-suffering financial sector may trade to new highs over the next six months.", "id": "ktrnqd", "created_utc": 1610201801.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "rising interest rates + FedResInk SPV claw back will kick off the insolvency crisis.\n\nAll the financials will exposed to this shock.\n\nThe FedResInk will do whatever it takes to prevent interest rates from rising... to the point of doing something that can't be undone easily (as they've clearly demonstrated over the last decade).\n\nEnjoy the ride, but keep an ear out for the stoppage of music and be prepared to find a seat quickly.", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "What are some possible red flags", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "If your stocks go down for a while that could be one.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "This guy trades stocks.

There are so many parallels, and yet it’s a different world. We still have a way to go before we approach the euphoria of ‘99. \n\nBoomer’s hit the workforce en masse during the 80’s and by the late 90’s had lots of assets to invest at a median age of 45. Percentages of American households that owned stocks was much higher in 00 than now. It was at an all time high of 62%. QE didn’t exist. Our government had actually balanced the budget and repaid national debt. I remember Greenspan was moving up rates that had been falling since the Volker highs of 20%. Debt markets more adequately priced risk and there was far, far, less debt. \n\nBrokers were still king and gatekeepers to the trading world they guarded. We barely traded back then. Retail trading was almost non existent. I was paying $200 in commission, per trade with Smith Barney. I had to invest in mutual funds with the first 100k. There was a $250k account minimum to trade options, but my broker wouldn’t let me. She would price gouge me if she did. I didn’t get much information, and it wasn’t in real-time. Financials couldn’t be trusted. Some companies rocketed upward by literally classifying liabilities as assets. \n\nThe dot com collapse was unprecedented. We had the ‘87 crash, but that was different. We saw Japan rocket, then implode but had different signals. We weren’t divesting into foreign economies like they did. We couldn’t really trade foreign companies in the dot com era to diversify. Brokerages were doing 10% and 5% margin to allow for 10x - 20x leverage. Most people couldn’t effectively hedge and were totally reliant on brokers taking care of them. Given that the the political landscape of the world has so rapidly changed, everyone believed world peace and American lead globalization was assured. People were convinced it was different this time. We hadn’t been been through a real sustained crash. It was a dozen years earlier that 87 crash happened, we V recovered out and it was attributable to junk bonds. America led the world and was unrivaled. It was like our Titanic had glanced off icebergs before and we didn’t see the need or sense to worry about icebergs anymore.\n\nThe excesses were insane. Dominoes began to tip late in 99. Smart money legends like Peter Lynch went to cash in 98-99. Boomers mocked their elders too. Undeniable cracks showed up after the new millennium.

Here’s another chapter for you:\n\nMy girlfriend at the time was a broker for Merrill Lynch down in San Diego. San Diego was the headquarters of Qualcomm, along with several large defense companies, up and coming biotechnology, etc. Wall Street didn’t sink it’s claws in Silicon Valley soon enough or deep enough. It was as if they were determined not to repeat that mistake in San Diego.\n\nProsperity frothed over everywhere. Everybody was becoming millionaires. It was just the norm. The houses that were bought for 50k, just a decade earlier, were selling for a 2 mil now. Brokers needed to put that dead equity to work! Freshly minted millionaires from stock options required expert guidance with finances and you get what you pay for, right?\n\nQualcomm was founded 15 years earlier in San Diego. After only a decade and a half, it had thousands of employees and the largest market cap in the world! Maybe Tesla will get there in the next couple of years. Time will tell. At this time and this place there were only a little over a hundred Merrill brokers in San Diego to soak up all that wealth. \n\nMy girlfriend went to work for one of of the OG San Diego brokers, that needed an junior broker to handle his immense client base. No bullshit, I never met the guy; nobody did anymore. He was intent upon sailing the world on his yacht, indefinitely. He hired an attractive 22 year old so he didn’t have to deal with clients or corporate. After all, spending your life in an office is no way to celebrate passively earning millions in commissions / management fees each year.\n\nThe corporate Christmas party ahead of the new millennium was surreal. Young brokers were coke’d to the gills, parading around like conquering heroes (along with a singular heroine.) They wore fine tailored suits, exquisite timepieces, and flawless, beach-tan, platinum blonde, Stepford wives. All of them wanted to display their riches and swap glory war stories. \n\nI was legitimately concerned one of the brokers was going to OD right in front of me. He was sweating profusely as he animatedly bragged to me about how he made his, “nobody, working class client” 40 mil within five years by 30x margin on Cisco...Or was it $30 mil on 40x leverage? It’s fuzzy, because of the uncomfortable feeling of this turbocharged douchebag invading my personal space like he wants fuck or fight. Looking back, I can see that he was just on autopilot. The fucker was pitching me how he would make me incredibly rich just by entrusting him with a hundred thousand...to start. The balls on this kid! He was going to close on another broker’s date/prospect, in front of everyone. It was a no lose scenario for him, succeed and get the client. Fail mightily and he still let everyone know much more aggressive he was than them.\n\nThat kid laid it down on me. I’d have to detest money and capitalism if I didn’t take this once in a lifetime opportunity to work with him. “Let’s talk Monday,” was my only way out. After what might’ve been the most intense pitch of my life, I quietly tipped the pretty waitress $100 with an apologetic look. She had to replenish the expensive champagne at an astonishing rate and deal with the type of entitled harassment you’d dreadfully expect. I worried about the different kind of pressuring that might be applied to her later.\n\nCome to think of it: They were all young and pretty waitresses. Was that just San Diego thing? Does youthful beauty tend to concentrate and coalesce near nouveau rich or did the organizers arrange for and pay for that? What difference does it make if the outcome is the same. Those women may seek security the same way those men seek validation. Perhaps the guys were just glorified salesmen and the women were the real savvy investors. \n\nI can’t recollect any of the speeches that were made.

It hasn't thus far because of the cost to produce hydrogen.  ***But with the Biden administration and EU planning to invest heavily invest in solar and wind, the input cost to hydrogen electrolysis should decline enough to make hydrogen as cheap as natural gas*** \\[2\\]\\[6\\].  This is why hydrogen is such a huge growth play now.  The economics are only now just about to tip it into be the most economical form of electricity \\[3\\]\\[2\\].\n\nThe advantage of green hydrogen is that is completely green but as a couple of huge market advantage:\n\n1. More power density than Lithium battery.  What this means is that you can have vehicles going 600 miles unlike lithium battery;  or a small fuel cell footprint vs a large solar footprint for commercial buildings.  Picture  the size of a truck (fuel cell) vs a parking lot (solar) to power a big box retailer.\n2. Quick charge.

Bloom recently hired a GE to expand into the EU for 2021 \\[1\\]\n\nSo comparatively, we have a company with technology comparable to PLUG.\n\nBE made 800M in annual sales for 2020 (natural gas fuel cells).  They plan to address the hydrogen market by 2022. Like PLUG, they plan to have 1GW of capacity 2025.\n\nLastly, their board is comprise of government insiders and the former CEO of GE \\[4\\].  So they are well position to gain more regulation in favor of hydrogen and knowledge on how to expand internationally.\n\nYou are buying BE for when hydrogen will be the main fuel source starting in 2025 onward. It will overtake Lithium Ion by 2035.  Buying into hydrogen now is like buying into TSLA when it introduce its first lithium ion battery.

{"title": "$WISH, The Ultimate Stimulus Play", "selftext": "This post is not financial advice and I am not an expert. Please do your own due diligence. \n\nI made a post on Tuesday morning about $WISH, and since then, the share price rose from about $18.80 to $21.58 (up nearly 15%), and then dipped back down to $20.36 on Friday. The post where I explain why I believe Wish.com is undervalued can be viewed here: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kqv48d/why_wish_has_the_potential_to_go_to_the_moon_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nThere are a few highly influential events that I believe will happen soon, and I’m gonna try to explain why I think Wish.com is the perfect play to navigate the next few months and beyond. \n\n1. With the house, senate, and presidency going democrat, I believe that additional stimulus, if not passed very soon, will be in the news non-stop. Even if it doesn’t pass right away, this simply means there is more time to play the hype. \n2. I believe that data will come out showing that not enough people are being vaccinated and/or too many people will refuse to become vaccinated. This can create uncertainty about extended stay-at-home orders and/or delays in getting back to a normal way of life.\n3. I believe there will be uncertainty around increases in taxes for big companies. \n\nIn reference to point 3, I believe Wish’s share price is so undervalued that it can weather any overall market volatility caused by news of attempts to increase corporate taxes. As an e-commerce company, it is a no-brainer that wish.com will benefit from additional stimulus and extended lockdowns. \n\nOn top of this, WISH is yet to release their first earnings report post-IPO, and the quiet period before analysts start setting price targets will be over very soon. Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, and Bank of America did the underwriting for Wish. The share price is currently down 15% from the IPO price of $24. I would assume that those three companies would set higher price targets for Wish to justify the IPO price that they did the underwriting for. \n\nPositions: I’m deep into shares and considering long-dated $25-$30 calls.", "id": "ku2nx4", "created_utc": 1610236638.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "I'm long wish but when I get on wish I have second thoughts... doesn't seem like it will ever compare to amazon.
