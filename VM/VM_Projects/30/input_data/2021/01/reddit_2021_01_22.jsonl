{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning January 25th, 2021", "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 25th, 2021.\n\n# **Apple and Tesla earnings, along with the Fed and GDP will drive markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/apple-and-tesla-earnings-vaccine-news-and-the-fed-will-be-focus-of-markets-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Stimulus euphoria may be waning, but investors will have plenty to focus on in the week ahead, as a blast of earnings news hits, the Federal Reserve meets and new data will show the state of the economy at the end of the year.\n*****\n> Stocks gained in the past week on optimism for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, proposed by President Joe Biden. But by Friday, the market lost steam amid increased concerns about the pandemic’s economic impact, and as it seemed Biden would not have an easy time getting the stimulus plan approved.\n*****\n> Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Tesla and more than 100 other S&P 500 companies report earnings in the biggest rush of earnings reports this quarter.\n*****\n> The pandemic will also be a factor as travel restrictions and lockdowns threaten the global economy, and worries remain over the speed of vaccine distributions.\n*****\n> But there is hope that Johnson and Johnson will release positive news on its vaccine results soon, and if that’s the case it could signal another source of vaccines will be available. The J&J vaccine would be a single shot, as opposed to the currently available double-shot vaccines.\n*****\n> “We expect to see their results,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “That could be super bullish.” The company reports earnings on Tuesday.\n*****\n> Hogan said the market may also respond to Covid news. He said the seven-day average in new Covid cases fell below the 14-day average this past week for the first time since Thanksgiving, and if that continues, it could indicate a peak.\n*****\n> If the virus news improves, the market could resume its grind higher in the coming week, said Hogan.\n*****\n> # Economy\n> As for the economy, the first look at fourth quarter real gross domestic product comes Thursday, and it is expected to show growth of 4.7%, according to the CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update survey. For the year, the economists surveyed expect GDP contracted by 3.5%. The economists forecast 5% growth for 2021.\n*****\n> Consumers pulled back at the end of the fourth quarter, evidenced by a surprise 0.7% decline in December retail sales reported this past week, after a negative November.\n*****\n> “You’re really going to see a loss of momentum throughout the quarter,” said Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. “It’s a set up for a really weak Q1.” PMI data shows manufacturing activity has been strong, but labor market data is weak and consumer spending is disappointing.\n*****\n> “You’ve got to juxtapose what’s happening with the vaccine and the virus with what’s happening with underlying data. We’ve definitely seen a lot of the things that could spark a pullback,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equity strategist at RBC.\n*****\n> Calvasina and other strategists expect a sell-off early in the year.\n*****\n> Stocks hit new highs across the major indices Wednesday, as Biden was inaugurated, and many technicians see the market as overbought. The catalyst for a pullback is not clear, but strategists expect the market to gain this year and say a buying opportunity would open up with any decline.\n*****\n> “Do we start to see stuff showing up in that data that makes us question that recovery?” said Calvasina. “My assumption is we’re going to get a lot of volatility in that data, and we’re going to get some downdrafts but it’s not going to be bad enough to erase this upward trajectory we’ve seen in the economy since the second quarter.”\n*****\n> # Fed ahead\nThe Fed is also a powerful backstop for the market, and economists don’t expect the Fed to take any action or change in its dovish tone when it releases its statement Wednesday afternoon, following its two-day meeting.\n*****\n> “I don’t see them making many changes,” said Cummins of NatWest. “They’ll probably acknowledge just the fact that employment was weak.\n*****\n> “It’s going to be pretty clear cut,” he added. “I think Powell will sound similar to what he sounded like in September.” Cummins said the Fed chairman is likely to say the economic outlook depends on the course of the virus and vaccine.\n*****\n> There is also durable goods data Wednesday and personal income and spending data on Friday. The Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, the PCE deflator is also released Friday, and Powell will surely be asked Wednesday afternoon about inflation, which is increasingly being priced into market expectations.\n*****\n> Powell is also likely to be asked his views on fiscal stimulus, which could end up being smaller than some expect.\n*****\n> Hogan of National Securities said the market traded lower on Friday on expectations the package could be smaller and take longer than expected to gain approval.\n*****\n> “I think the realism of saying $1.9 trillion and doing $1.9 trillion are two different things,” he said. “We fall into that trap all the time.”\n*****\n> “What’s happening now is there is no magic wand here,” Hogan added. “It’s not to say there’s no stimulus. It’s just a matter of how long it will take and how much there will be. There’s a little bit of realism.”\n*****\n> Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, said a pullback could be sparked if bitcoin starts to fall more sharply, since some investors would sell stock in response. “When there’s no bid in bitcoin they have to sell something, and they sell stock,” said Maley.\n*****\n> Bitcoin has had a wild early ride in 2021. The cryptocurrency hit a record high of $41,973 on Jan. 12, according to data from Coin Metrics. Days later, it fell about 15%, wiping out as much as $200 billion in just 24 hours.\n*****\n> Bitcoin then regained some of its losses, surging to near $40,000 before another reversal. On Friday, it was trading at $33,200 after dipping below $30,000.\n*****\n> “If this thing starts tanking again, it’s going to cause some forced selling and it’s going to cause some selling in the stock market,” said Maley, adding it will be important to hold the low from Thursday night.\n*****\n> He said the short position in the dollar is also an overcrowded trade that could turn quickly. A resulting short squeeze could cause a dollar rally that would be negative for the stock market. He also is watching Tesla, which reports earnings on Wednesday.\n*****\n> “I think whether it be bitcoin, the dollar, Tesla, one of these crowded trades...it’s going to turn the narrative that’s permeating right now, and if we don’t get a surprise the market will continue to push higher,” he said.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/eO7d7Zq.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/1GWbub4.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/tyhAE90.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/vbOa37l.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8HqdRsR.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NZeUiVr.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6E5RdpT.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3Igc9Mf.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/hBm7jZ6.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/6jxbrCb.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/5SrZWIY.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/PwdsNDj.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/nseHMnr.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # February Almanac: Worst S&P 500 Month of Post-Election Years\n\n> Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.0% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.\n\n> February’s post-election year performance since 1950 is miserable, ranking dead last for S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000. Average losses have been sizable: -1.5%, -3.3% and -1.6% respectively. February ranks tenth for DJIA in post-election years with an average loss of 1.1%. February 2001 and 2009 were exceptionally brutal. NASDAQ dropped 22.4% in February 2001, its third worst monthly loss ever.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/d4b3e8cda0a49d76ee55a9768e6c579a/153e22faa5d70761-e1/s400x600/32c0464083a6087a711ac381b9350a1420626ac6.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Housing Closes Out 2020 on a Positive Note\n\n> Housing closed out 2020 on an extremely positive note as both Housing Starts and Building Permits topped forecasts by more than 100K. Since 2002, there have only been ten other months where both reports topped forecasts by more than 100K, and today's report was the third time it happened in the last 12 months!\n\n> The table below breaks down the details of the December report in terms of both single and multi-family units and regions. One of the clear areas of strength was in single-family starts and permits. On a y/y basis, both were up over 25%, and relative to November, starts were up 12% while permits rose 7.8%. Multi-family units, meanwhile, both saw declines with notable weakness in multi-family starts. On a regional basis, most areas of the country saw strength although starts and permits were down m/m and y/y in the Northeast.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Details.png))**\n\n> Given its overall size, you can easily make the case that as goes the housing market, so goes the economy, and history tends to bear this out. The top chart shows the 12-month average of Housing Starts going back to 1967 with recessions overlaid in gray. With the exception of the latest downturn, every prior recession was preceded by a rollover in Housing Starts. Given the sudden onset of the pandemic, housing played no role in the current recession, but once the lockdowns started, the residential housing market wasn't immune to the weakness. Whatever weakness there was didn't last long. As shown in the second chart below, less than a year after the recession started, both the 12-month average of Housing Starts and Building Permits have now moved back above their pre-pandemic highs.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-and-Business-Cycle.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-and-Business-Cycle-Last-10-Years.png))**\n\n> While Housing Starts and Building Permits are both at new multi-year highs, on a population-adjusted basis, they're still closer to levels typically associated with recessions than expansions. After adjusting for population growth, Housing Starts would need to come in above 1.9 million just to keep up with population growth.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Population-Adjusted.png))**\n\n> As for the stocks of homebuilders, the performance of the iShares Home Construction ETF (ITB) tends to track trends in Housing Starts and Building Permits pretty closely, so it's no surprise that it also traded to a new all-time high on Thursday for the first time in three months. As long as interest rates don't see a sudden spike higher, trends in place for the residential housing market remain positive.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-vs-ITV.png))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Building-Permits-vs-ITV.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Impressive Reading From The Philly Fed\n\n> Of the several strong economic data points to have been released today, perhaps the strongest relative to expectations was the Philadelphia Fed's monthly survey on the region's manufacturing sector. The headline index was expected to rise from 11.1 to 11.8. Instead, it more than doubled expectations rising to 26.5. That is the highest reading since last February just before the pandemic's full impact was felt. Overall, the report showed the region's manufacturing sector experienced strong growth in January with accelerating growth in demand, prices, and employment.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-HL.png))**\n\n> In the table below, we break down the various sub-indices of the report. Nearly every component experienced a month over month increase that ranks in the top few percentiles of their respective histories. That also left most indices in the top decile of their historic ranges. That compares to last month in which most readings were far more moderate. Although most indices for current conditions saw impressive readings, the indices for expectations were much more mixed with a larger number falling than rising MoM. Given every one of these indices remains positive, though, the region's manufacturers still have an overall optimistic outlook.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Table1.png))**\n\n> Of all the sub-indices, the New Orders index saw one of the most significant increases in January rising 28.1 percentage points from a barely expansionary reading of 1.9 to a much stronger reading of 30. Going back over the past couple of years, the only times this index was higher was in October (32.9) and February (30.7) of last year. That indicates very strong new order growth after a slowdown in December.\n\n> Similarly, the index for unfilled orders was the only index in contractionary territory (those below zero) last month, but there was a massive improvement this month as the index surged to a reading of 25.6. Both the level of the index and the monthly change stand in the top 1% of all readings going back through the history of the survey which began in 1968. The only times the index has been higher was in August of 1972 (26) and January (29.6) and March (45.1) of 1973. In other words, New Orders remain strong while Unfilled Orders are bouncing back at a historic rate.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Orders.png))**\n\n> While the unfilled orders index reached one of the highest readings on record, the index for Delivery Times actually hit a new record. The index rose 12.7 points to a record high of 30; surpassing the previous record of 21.3 from October of 2017. Higher readings in this index indicate that supplier lead times are longer and vice versa for lower readings. That means a historic number of respondents are seeing delays in their supply chains.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Deliveries.png)**\n\n> Perhaps to get ahead of the growing demand and longer lead times, businesses are also reporting higher inventories. That index rose to the highest level since September of 2019 which also stands in the top 5% of all readings in the history of the data.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Inv.png)**\n\n> Given the stronger demand and tighter supply lines, prices have also been accelerating. Both Prices Paid and Prices Received experienced some of their largest monthly increases on record after rising 20.5 points in January. At 45.4, the index for Prices Paid is at its highest level since August of 2018. Those price increases are also getting passed along to customers as the index for Prices Received is at the highest level since February of 1989. These results echo some other hints of more inflationary conditions like the New York Fed's readings last week and the ISM services and manufacturing report earlier this month.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Prices.png)**\n\n*****\n\n> # Real-time COVID-19 Data Suggests Final Peak May Be Here\n\n> It has been exactly one year since the first COVID-19 case in the United States was reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and to say the world as we know it has been completely changed would be an understatement. Thankfully, we may finally be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n> With the rollout of multiple approved vaccines underway, some real-time COVID-19 indicators and mobility-related data points have put in their final highs (or lows). As shown in the LPL chart of the day, restrictions implemented at the end of 2020 appear to be helping to curb the spread of the virus, as new COVID-19 cases and those currently hospitalized have been on the decline.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Meanwhile, the positive rate has also declined despite daily tests near all-time highs.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> However, while COVID-19 data has been improving, real-time economic indicators like OpenTable reservations show businesses continue to struggle as restrictions on activities to curb the late-2020 surge remain in place.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Similarly, the number of people getting on airlines has fallen back to mid-October levels after the holiday bump. Domestic air travel activity remains 64% below pre-pandemic levels.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> “The good news is that cases are declining and vaccine distribution is increasing, but service industries and air travel are clearly still under a lot of pressure,” said LPL Research Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While manufacturing and housing data remain firm, recent data on the job market and consumer spending have been choppy.”\n\n> It’s very encouraging to see COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations improving, a trend we hope will continue until this pandemic ends for good. In the meantime, we will continue to follow high-frequency data to gauge the recovery’s progress. The next report card comes next week with the release of fourth quarter 2020 gross domestic product (GDP).\n\n> We’ll also be closely watching developments in Washington, DC.

How do you get it to refueling infrastructure even if you have it? Hydrogen is impractical to transport on trucks because its volume to power ratio is so ridiculously bad. You need so many more refueling runs to deliver the same amount of potential energy as compared to petrol, it's very expensive. So infrastructure has to be either on-site electrolysis or pipelines, both also very expensive. It's not practical. If you ignore fuel transport problems hydrogen looks like it makes sense on its own, but in the bigger picture, it really doesn't.\n\nRail has the same problem, it's large fixed inflexible infrastructure that has high cost. Only makes sense for the highest volume routes. Otherwise it's trucking.\n\nBattery costs are improving ~15%-20% per year.

A prototype Li-ion battery was developed by Akira Yoshino in 1985, based on earlier research by John Goodenough, M.

I will take a look at the biggest institutional inflows and outflows into Gamestop and ~~reason myself into bullish confirmation bias~~ explain why objectively the buyers are right and the sellers are fuk.\n\nYou can also see my full DD with charts and images and emojis and shit in this PowerPoint, *yes there is a Powerpoint, DID I STUTTER?:* [*https://docdro.id/zbMjIJk*](https://docdro.id/zbMjIJk)\n\nThis DD is concerned with **institutional investments** in Gamestop. Why do we care about institutional investors?\n\n1. They can greatly influence the price with big buy or sell orders\n2. They often have longer holding periods than WSB autists. If many institutions hold Gamestop, it reduces the actively traded float and increases the probability of a short squeeze.\n3. Institutional buy-in means support for the fundamental value of Gamestop and confidence in their turnaround.\n\n**Tl;dr:** Lots of institutions IMMEDIATELY but quietly made big bets on Gamestop after Ryan Cohen made his first investment. I believe these inflows will continue as his influence on the company grows. While many institutions also exited Gamestop in the past months, due to the timing of their sales I believe these were panic sells that were made prematurely.\n\n***Even more tl;dr:*** **🚀🚀🚀🐂🐂🐂🍆🍆🍆💦💦💦,** but you really might need to hold for quite a few months to see big gains.\n\nThis post talks about three different issues:\n\n1. Gamestop’s situation in Summer 2020, and how Ryan Cohen swooped in to save the day.\n2. How different institutions reacted to Ryan Cohen’s investment\n3. Why the bullish institutions were right, and the bearish ones were wrong\n\n**Part 1: Initial situation in summer of 2020**\n\nThings were looking real dire for Gamestop just a couple of months ago.\n\n[-91&#37; return in 5 years, nice](https://preview.redd.it/ejlho2zamuc61.png?width=1846&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e3d0686cb7459d56d881f43865474489f5be60b)\n\nThe price was on a consistent slide. Sentiment was absolutely terrible. A dying brick and mortar company. Going short was a sure thing. Then, Covid and retail closures. Bear thesis totally confirmed, right? Right?\n\nIn swoops Ryan Cohen and sneakily accumulates 5% of the company. We all know what happened to the share price after.\n\n[Look at that erection](https://preview.redd.it/u5i7k2oemuc61.png?width=1517&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5a99e455105e7cd1d6cd85c12d65afbdb225e6f)\n\nThis DD is mainly concerned with institutional money flows in Q3 2020 - who bought and who sold, and what can we conclude from that?\n\n**Part 2: How different institutions reacted in Q3**\n\nNow sadly reporting takes a long time so we only know what movements funds made up until September 30, 2020. But that gives us a glimpse into what funds did in the same quarter in which Ryan Cohen bought in.\n\nIn that quarter, institutions ***bought*** 22m shares of Gamestop and ***sold*** 13m. A few big names were involved both in the selling and the buying.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/62lu32fimuc61.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=234024c1e51099af1c098c4e556f6b788512e45d\n\n\"But drunkiez\", you say \"why do I care? So some institutions sold and some bought? How does this info help me go to Mars?\" Read on my child.\n\n**Part 3: Why the bulls were right**\n\nThe relevant info here is ***timing***. If we just look at the the Top 10 funds with the biggest Gamestop inflows in Q3 2020, 7 of those opened completely ***new*** positions once they heard about Cohen's first investment. The other 3 increased their share count by ***200-900%!*** They realized immediately that the narrative would shift completely - Gamestop would no longer be seen as a dying retailer, but had a long-term chance for a new future. These guys are in it for the long haul. Companies like Morgan Stanley and Susquehanna hold their positions for an average of 20-40 quarters. The average WSB tard can't even hold for 20-40 minutes.\n\n[Institutions are loving this turnaround story](https://preview.redd.it/jg1zasbnnuc61.png?width=1148&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf69d9a1a36ee3c4fbd55ffed3e9447c069d4079)\n\nNow what about the poopoo bears?\n\nWe can see that many big institutions like Blackrock also exited in Q3 2020. These funds also have long holding periods. In fact, you can see in the chart below that the Top 10 bearish institutions had nearly **unchanged share holdings** since at least September 2019, and suddenly panic sold at the height of the Covid panic, right before they heard about Cohen's involvement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The most bearish institutions bagheld for months and panic sold right before our lord came in](https://preview.redd.it/huityktkmuc61.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=0aa909d1a28f275276f9987580a769650fc3f684)\n\nActually, the truth is even worse then the chart shows. Many big dick funds started making bullish bets on Gamestop even before 2019. Yes, you read that right. Blackrock made a huge bullish bet in Q2 2018, bagheld for over two years, then panic sold weeks before Ryan Cohen got in. Citigroup kept accumulating in 2018 and 2019, then suddenly sold almost the entire stake at the very bottom. D.E. Shaw went all in at the beginning of 2019, and panic sold at the bottom. They all deserve to be mods on this sub. Do you really want to follow these people with your trades?\n\nWhat does this mean for the future? Sometime in February we will receive new filings on institutional purchases made in Q4 2020. I expect to see many more inflows as Ryan Cohen continued his commitment. Not to speak of Q1 2021, when he actually got operationally involved with 3 new board members. This turnaround story has only just begun.\n\n**Bonus: why it's a good idea to trust Ryan Cohen**\n\nA lot has been done to praise Ryan Cohen on this sub. If you want to understand why I'm bullish on anything he does, read this great DD by runningAndJumping22: [GME DD - Background and experience of new leadership](https://www.reddit.com/r/runningAndJumping22/comments/l1egkw/gme_dd_background_and_experience_of_new_leadership/)\n\nI just want to add one point to this: building a successful startup is HARD. Out of the companies that receive funding (which in itself is really hard to do), 9 out of 10 will go on to fail. But you know what increases your chances of building a successful company to almost 100%? **If you've already done it before**. You have the money, the network and the talent to do it again. Look what the founders of Paypal later accomplished: Tesla, Affirm, SpaceX, all of Peter Thiel's successes, Palantir, Youtube, Linkedin, etc. Very different companies, every single one of them a winner.\n\nVC funds will fall over themselves to give money to previously successful founders, because **they know they will have an almost 100% chance of succeeding again**. Ryan and his buddies have done it once, and they can do it again. It doesn't really matter to us how they do it. They could walk into any fund's office and easily collect tens of millions to start a new gaming e-commerce company. But they chose to do it with Gamestop. Not a bad idea in itself.\n\nIn my opinion, they could literally close every single store, sell all assets and use the net cash of USD 200m to build an ecommerce company from scratch (btw: Chewy, which ships 60 POUND HEAVY BAGS OF DOG FOOD only used USD 130m in capital investments while Ryan Cohen was there). But Gamestop does come with some good assets: a store base, a well-known name, partnerships, Reginald Fils Aime on the board, etc.\n\nOne hindrance is that the name Gamestop is poison on Wall Street. I know this point has been beaten to death lately, but I think it will take **several quarters of Cohen's involvement and operational changes** to truly change that, so you really shouldn't invest a ton of money if you're not willing to hold for that long. However, we can see that sentiment started changing almost immediately once Ryan Cohen got it, and I don't see that stopping anytime soon. Even without a short squeeze, this stock can go to the moon in the coming years.\n\n***tl;dr once more:*** **🚀🚀🚀🐂🐂🐂🍆🍆🍆💦💦💦**", "id": "l2jwg0", "created_utc": 1611306155.0, "score": 219, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "Don’t hold back, it’s one big circle jerk over here", "score": 23, "replies": []}, {"body": "*coom", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Agreed, I also am of opinion it's actually smart money buying the stocks, aiming for either long term hold (bet on successful billionaire) or in some instances a high-risk short squeeze play.

Nevertheless I wouldn't score 100% gains in two weeks with low risk stocks, would I? Also, truth to be told - bear thesis seems to largely misguided at this stage but still has its merits. Otherwise GME wouldn't be most shorted stock in history (I think). If RC doesn't pull off his digital transformation vision, GME is indeed fucked when current console cycle ends.

{"title": "Why BB’s QNX might not be that promising", "selftext": "BB is really hot lately, I was working in the industry and pretty familiar with BB’s QNX. QNX is a very good RTOS, stable and reliable. However the biggest problem for BB to turn QNX into revenue is that the QNX is really at the very bottom of the systems, there is no way that they could charge it like SaaS. Can you imagine you have a car, if you don’t renew the system, you won’t be able to drive it? That’s a joke right? The only way BB can charge the car manufacturers is one time royalty per car, however it’s very hard for BB to increase the price, because there is another option that car manufacturers could use, the Automotive Grade Linux. Tesla and Li Auto’s systems are based on AGL, although some people argue that AGL is not as safe as QNX, Tesla is really a good showcase that QNX is definitely not the only option. Toyota is also moving away from QNX for some of their models starting from 2017. The management of BB realized this problem, they are really concerned and proposed the concept of IVY, but really it’s just a concept, Amazon wants to use it to expand their AWS business, but there is definitely big uncertainty here, as there are a lot of ways to store the driving data, it would be interesting to see the product of IVY on real car.", "id": "l2mxh3", "created_utc": 1611319257.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.53, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "You sir, will be left behind.

So I think they're quite an obvious choice (as can be deduced from the 175mil cars driving around using it as well). \n\nIn terms of royalties, they get a royalty for every car (some cars have multiple QNX systems, which probably results in bigger royalties).

{"title": "For those who doubted $GME, Part 2:", "selftext": "[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwjyhm/for_those_who_doubted_gme/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\n[DD for idiots.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxl1ku/tomorrows_best_play/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\n\nI’d like to start off by saying, this is not about $GME.\n\nIt’s about $PLTR. 🚀\n\nI’m going to state my opinion on GME first however so I can get the criticism out of the way. I made my profits, got in at about $37, and I honestly doubted myself if it’d go up. I believed in you guys, and believed in u/DeepFuckingValue more than anything. I admit; I cashed out today at $71 per share. I made some good returns and whether or not it continues to rise is beyond me, I hope it does but I also hope that all the people who get in today don’t become bag holders. It’s really stressful, especially not knowing where the peak is gonna be. However, this is where I draw everyone’s attention to the best play yet to be made.\n\nToday in PLTR’s unpredictable (yet predictable if you check my linked posts) journey we saw a good 15% run, and is still continuing to do so. Reason being that there’s a major demo-day happening for $PLTR on Tuesday. Followed by earning reports shortly after. This means everyone’s wanting to buy in now before the weekend and not having to get in last minute on Monday the day before. This small gain is only a fraction of what $PLTR is capable of doing, I recommend reading [this deep dive for retards](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxl1ku/tomorrows_best_play/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) if you’re clueless on why Palantir is a good buy. \n\nHere’s why I’m making a part two:\n\nWSB is unstoppable, if you’re still a doubter. That’s probably because you’re a paper handed fuck who checks RH every hour of the day and wets themselves when they see -5%. If you want to play a little more passive for guaranteed free money, PLTR is the move. Upon this demo-day and earnings report I’m expecting nothing but good news, which leads us to lockup. \n\nLockup will be happening very soon as well, that’s when 80% of the current stock that’s unavailable to be trader because it’s held by insiders (employees and some investors) will able to be publicly trader. You may think that’s a bad thing, however it’s not. Yes, I do think lots of shares will be sold off. Although, this allows huge investment firms to be able to finally get their hands on some PLTR shares that they haven’t been able to receive since its DPO. If major investment firms start claiming those shares upon lockup, then this is the inevitable moon we’ve all been waiting for. But what if they don’t buy up these shares? That’s where we come in. You’ve done it with $GME, you had faith in DeepFuckingValue. Now, have faith in $PLTR and Shuffil. You can either buy some shares now, which may seem high but I promise it’s only a fraction because $PLTR is the best long-term hold currently in the entire market. That’s a bold claim, but we all know it’s true. Just look at its infantile competition $SNOW, which IPO’d at @$200+. Take those $GME tendies and set yourself up for the Tesla of data analysis, something all companies will need in order to succeed in the future. \n\nTL;DR: Buy PLTR with $GME tendies. PLTR demo-day next week, followed by earning report shortly after.\n\n🚀🚀", "id": "l2tgbd", "created_utc": 1611339226.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.35, "num_comments": 39, "comments": [{"body": "Take those profits you made on GME and buy more GME instead", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly what I did.
