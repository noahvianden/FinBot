{"title": "$VLNS Short Ladder Attack On Retail Investors Near Its End, Video Footage of Manipulative Tactics Inside, Alongside DD And Discussion Of Common Manipulatory Practice Every Trader Should Know.", "selftext": "Alright, where shall I start, I suppose with the manipulation and short interest that has caused retail traders to take a beating. Last week I noticed Valens a Cannabis company has taken a 40% loss without any connection to recent events or news except potentially a recent brought offering deal which was good news but the shares were for less then market value. I decided to dig a little deeper and starting observing level 2 data charts, this is where things get interesting.... nobody's selling, literally very few shares have changed hands and volume is 8-10X its regular amount and even that is an understatement.  I found the yahoo finance discussions and saw many others calling the BS in this recent drop, several 5 cent drops with no volume??\n\nHow can that be, while short laddering of course and the extent of it has been insane once I observed level 2 data all day long as they keep lowering their ask for no reason forcing people out of positions. They ain't just shorting for fun though, they want this company and they want it bad and they have been stealing it from retail traders at rock bottom prices, I will explain why further on. One thing I noticed throughout the past week was that ZERO, yes literally zero buy ins on the level 2 data log were showing on the chart nor on volume measurements, giving the impression that this stock is ONLY being sold in big orders which is not the case and far from the truth, likely to give the impression of institutional selling or bad news incoming but the opposite is likely closer to the truth. Jim Cramer Spoke of this in 2006 as a tactic he used as a hedge fund manager.\n\n[https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/how-do-hedge-funds-hide-order-execution.125290/](https://www.elitetrader.com/et/threads/how-do-hedge-funds-hide-order-execution.125290/)\n\nEvidence 1: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f98-c\\_Z2lgE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f98-c_Z2lgE) (Note how shares purchased are no where near displayed volume yet price has the impression of lowering and having sales)\n\nI know all of this is false though, because if it were true they would't be using hidden buy orders and I caught it all on video for you guys below. Legally, they can't hide this info from level 2 data however they totally are allowed to for the chart volume, the way its been done... to give the impression of insider sales while soaking up all the panic driven investors is just agonizing to watch. This is whats called *Richard Wyckoff* method and has been used since the 1930's, where they use every trick in the book to shake retail traders out of their hand when they find a good position. Richard Wyckoff method takes time and effort to pull of from collaborated hedge funds so the exciting part is its only done when they feel they have up to a 50 point upside or more. Its very interesting and a quote/link to the article is below and im 100% certain im watching this unfold, its taken me days of observing and research to say this is a certainty. They just updated short info data for valens as well and you can see how quickly its rising, im not sure if they are beginning to cover yet, but when they do we may see a small cover rally.\n\n[https://shortdata.ca/stock/VLNS.TO/](https://shortdata.ca/stock/VLNS.TO/)\n\n[https://financialpost.com/investing/the-secret-trading-strategy-from-the-1930s-that-hedge-funders-dont-want-you-to-know-about](https://financialpost.com/investing/the-secret-trading-strategy-from-the-1930s-that-hedge-funders-dont-want-you-to-know-about)\n\n\"‚ÄúHe prefers to do this while the market is weak, dull, inactive and depressed. To the extent that they are able, he, and the other interests with whom he works, bring about the very conditions which are most favorable for accumulation of stocks at low prices‚Ä¶\n\n‚ÄúWhen he wishes to accumulate a¬†line,¬†**he raids the market for that stock, makes it look very weak, and gives it the appearance of heavy liquidation by sending in selling orders through a great number of brokers.**‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúThen he forces the price down to around 30 by offering large amounts of stock and inducing floor traders and other people to sell their long holdings or go short because the stock looks weak. By putting the price down, he may sell 10,000 shares and buy 20,000; **hence he has 10,000 shares long at the lower prices** of his range of accumulation.\"\n\n‚ÄúBy keeping the stock low and depressed, he discourages other people from buying it and induces more short selling. He may, by various means, spread bearish reports on the stock. All this helps him to¬†buy. When he is thus buying and selling to accumulate, **he necessarily causes the price to move up and down, forming the familiar trading ranges,** or congestion areas, which appear frequently on figure charts.‚Äù\n\nMy studies of short data are that when they cover, the amount of fraudulent shares changing hands decreases and its normal to see a blip in price over the next few days. I've also noticed and influx of yahoo finance posters or stock bashers online, never that untypical for a stock thats heavily shorted, probably the hedge fund interns or something. But anyways my point is hedge funds are literally STEALING a great company from retail traders using unfair unjust tactics and they think nobody is on to them, look at the chart today and see if you notice something wrong... how does each drop compose of a 200k sell order several times today yet the price remained the same for a stock with typical 400-500k volume... the answer is manipulation and there is profit/revenge against the enemy to be had here. Check out the post below, our brothers have taken a hit because of them and im not the only one to see the short laddering.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/l823cf/please\\_help\\_small\\_investors\\_with\\_valens\\_we\\_are/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetbetsELITE/comments/l823cf/please_help_small_investors_with_valens_we_are/)\n\nHeres another video footage proof of short laddering/share accumulation in a downtrend I captured dozens I can provide as proof but I figured two was enough to get the point across of these deceptive tactics: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oldcm8P-whQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oldcm8P-whQ)\n\n[https://nakedshortreport.com/how-to-detect-short-trades](https://nakedshortreport.com/how-to-detect-short-trades)\n\nAnyways, from a chart perspective it seems this attack is basically over and now hedge funds are concerned about covering and accumulation of shares. Why do they want this company you may ask, while I will do a little DD below to get across how good of a steal it is.\n\nCurrently its trading at 1/100th of the market cap of $WEED and $APAH even though its revenue is 1/6th and isn't a much of a laggard in growth as you would think 20M EBITA this year as well. Old shareholders are losing optimism to get elsewhere in the industry where momentum lies somewhat fuelling the downtrend while institutions/insiders pick up shares. Either way so undervalued.... similar size cannabis company's have their shares trading at twice the amount. Valens was trading at near $4 at one point and is now at $1.70 dispite progress. Probably because honestly others like APAH had slightly quicker growth but that does not fairly mean a company is a write off.\n\nResearch on their strategic outlook can give somewhat of a better answer as to why revenue lags... the one thing they care about is capturing the largest market share via offering the cheapest prices even if it comes as a short term expense to the financial statement.\n\nThey continue to tout their cheapest prices of production and product and I can see this being a good tactic in the Cannabis market, you know who this sounds a lot like... amazon and we can see how their years of no profits turned out for the shareholders. Why do I think its hit its bottom now, its growing financials won't lie in its recent quarter, they just had a new acquisition into the edible market and are ending third party packaging services likely for competitive reasons giving it a small q3 revenue drop, management is supposedly super cocky when responding to shareholder emails suggesting they are getting results even in the face of doubt. Overall, seems like shareholders lost faith temporarily and hedge funds made sure to take advantage of that, the Cannabis market will continue to grow and im sure capital managers are happy to snag as much as cheap as they can.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VLNS.TO/community?p=VLNS.TO](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VLNS.TO/community?p=VLNS.TO)\n\nEven their balance sheet has me salivating for a company with so many asset,\n\n\"According to the last reported balance sheet, Valens had liabilities of CA$22.3m due within 12 months, and liabilities of CA$30.8m due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had CA$30.3m in cash and CA$35.5m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it actually has CA$12.7m more liquid assets than total liabilities'\n\nAnyways that my DD and a bit of a story as to whats going on with $VLNS, DISCLAIMER I TOOK A POSITION TODAY AND NOTICED THIS MAYBE NEEDS SOME AWARENESS.
