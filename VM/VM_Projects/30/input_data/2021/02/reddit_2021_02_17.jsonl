Stocks set to open flat after Dow closes at another record\n\n> * U.S. stock futures were steady Wednesday as Wall Street remained on track for its best monthly performance since November. A mixed session Tuesday saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average close at another record. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq broke their two-day winning streaks with small losses, falling from previous session record high closes.\n\n> * On Wednesday‚Äôs economic calendar, the Commerce Department is set to issue January retail sales at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell. Economists expect a 1.2% increase after a 0.7% December decline. At the same time, the Labor Department‚Äôs January look at producer prices is seen rising 0.4% after a 0.3% gain in December.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. B/itcoin soars to new high, topping $51,000 for first time\n\n> * B/itcoin smashed through $51,000 to hit a new all-time high Wednesday. Major financial companies appear to be warming to b/itcoin, while Tesla and other firms have also shown support for the c/ryptocurrency. B/itcoin‚Äôs latest rally is reminiscent of its massive ascent to nearly $20,000 in 2017, which was followed by an 80% plunge the following year. However, the world‚Äôs biggest c/ryptocurrency did stage a fierce comeback since, more than quadrupling in 2020 and gaining over 70% since the start of this year.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Here are Warren Buffett-run Berkshire‚Äôs stock moves last quarter\n\n> * Warren Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire Hathaway bought stakes worth $4.1 billion in Chevron and $8.6 billion in Verizon shares during the fourth quarter, according to the conglomerate‚Äôs latest 13-F filing with the SEC. Berkshire also sold its stakes in drug maker Pfizer and JPMorgan Chase, while trimming its Wells Fargo position. While still its biggest holding, Berkshire continued to trim its lucrative Apple stake, cutting it by about 6%. Four times a year, investors file their long positions with the government. The information is released to the public 45 days after each quarter ends.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. Elon Musk‚Äôs SpaceX valuation jumps to about $74 billion\n\n> * SpaceX completed another monster equity funding round of $850 million last week, people familiar with the financing told CNBC, sending the company‚Äôs valuation skyrocketing 60% from its previous raise in August to about $74 billion. Elon Musk, who also co-founded Tesla, saw insiders and existing investors in his commercial space company selling an additional $750 million in a secondary transaction, one of the people said. SpaceX did not immediately respond to CNBC‚Äôs request for comment on this report.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. Millions in Texas still without power as new storm hits\n\n> * Millions of residents in Texas were still in the dark Wednesday with no indication when their service might return as another winter storm moved across the southern part of the nation. In all, between 2 million and 3 million customers in the energy capital of the U.S. had no power ‚Äî two days after historic snow and single-digit temperatures created a surge in demand for electricity for heat.\n\n> * Wholesale power and natural gas prices soared in recent days. However, natural gas futures dropped early Wednesday. U.S. oil prices kept up their advance Wednesday, gaining more than 1% and pushing above $61 per barrel, levels not seen since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/vcVsj0V.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OrHC0Dg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/cOYL889.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/uHnErYd.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wWv2RIG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/968QLzv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/3YQkP3F.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/1NMfpXp.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/E4Hd7xJ.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Ma18ROK.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/8GagANl.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/bHXNSyG.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/I8iVnua.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/9xV4n0k.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/1MDX5ly.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-chevron-verizon-vir-biotechnology-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Hilton Worldwide (HLT)** ‚Äì The hotel operator reported a quarterly loss of 10 cents per share, surprising analysts who had expected a profit of 4 cents per share.

Where did you get that?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So this topic is a can of worms and gets into speculation.\n\nFirst of all, in the shorter-term sodium in the anode might be more the sufficient. In addition the more critical issue for EV's will be cheap production of batteries, which I think Tesla will be cheaper per kWh even without solid-state. In terms of weight, the structural pack benefits of the 4680 may beat the weight savings of solid-state in a pouch or prismatic format.\n\nAs to Tesla having solid-state batteries. Tesla has been working on solid-state batteries as well. This is nothing new. QS is notable in that they are seemingly the first to solve the major issues with making them work. Once QS batteries are out in the wild, everyone will be looking at them closely and seeing if they can learn what about their separator makes them work. Between that and Tesla's own efforts (maybe combined with whichever battery companies they will be working with) I think it will be a matter of time before they work out how to make a viable solid-state battery as well.\n\nI should add a significant caveat. I believe QS is using a stiff separator, which will not work well in a 4680 jelly roll. This means that if Tesla wants to stick with the 4680 format (which I think is likely is more important for cars and volume production then solid-state) they will need to figure out how to make the separator flexible enough. So there are significant differences in what they each do.\n\nIt could be in the end that Tesla's solutions work well in EV's where the batteries can be made structural components and in stationary systems where weight does not matter, whereas QS's battery will be better where you can't make it structural so the higher density and expected lower weight of the battery itself would be beneficial (e.g. maybe QS will be better for large trucks, shipping, etc). You might even have Tesla one day buying batteries from QS. The only issue QS will have, assuming this all works out, is that VW and others will be begging QS for every battery they can make as that will be their only chance of making cars that offer a decent alternative to what Tesla is making. In other words QS will be hard-pressed to meet demand for their batteries for a long-time.\n\nI actually opened a large position in QS (much less then my position in TSLA) as I think the company can see 10X return over the next 10 years (what they are doing seems very important to me), but between the two I am much more bullish on Tesla.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "great analysis. QS definitely has cracked the code for a viable solid state, they're still further away from mass scale production, another 5 years. Tesla would like to leverage their production battery production lines so it makes sense they would try to preserve the 4680 form while trying to improve the battery chemistry. I have a hunch 5 years is a decent time for tesla to double down and advance their current chem even further leading to a battery day part II right around where QS is scaling up. I think those smart guys at the canadian univ might just be able to enhance current battery chem to  match solid state standards. \n\nAgree, i'm now fully convinced QS is the next best battery tech play for this decade and missed out on opening a position < 50. Another dip(which i don't think will happen easy) and i will surely open a position", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Regarding improving the chem of the 4680 cells, there is a distinct advantage with solid-state in that you essentially do not need an anode, so in theory solid-state in the long-run should be able to have higher energy density then wet batteries. In any case, not sure that solid-state will necessarily achieve its higher levels of energy density anytime soon due to complications it likely causes with dendrites forming under such conditions. Wet batteries should be able to keep pace for a while still. What Tesla will probably want to eventually get to is a flexible solid-state battery that can preserve the 4680 format (with the benefits of solid-state).\n\nAs to buying QS.\n\nI had been thinking about buying in QS since they were around $42. I saw their presentation a while back and read the criticism someone had wrote up about it, but the more digging I did into it the more legit what QS is doing seemed. With the news today that they were able to make a multilayer cell, I think it pretty much seals the deal on that. Ending up buying around $62.\n\nNow while I think they may go up a lot over the next decade it is not clearly a guaranteed investment.\n\nThink about this number-wise...\n\nRight now it has a 24B market cap.\n\nLet's say they can get to 1 tWh in 10 years (not a certain thing at all, but maybe doable) that is 1,000,000,000 kWh's. Assuming sales price per kWh will be $100 and their cost will be $50 they can maybe net post-tax $40 per kWh. That would translate into $40B in profits per year. Assuming a modest PE ratio of 12 that is roughly a $500B market cap. If they are still a growth company the PE ration could be much higher (maybe a 1T market cap). Under these aggressive assumptions you are looking at a 10X-20X return in 10 years (in today's dollars), which is a great investment.\n\nChange this around to they get to 500 gWh's in 10 years (also far from certain) and instead of $50 gross profit it is $25 per kWh and $20 after tax, now you are at $10B in profit. Using 12X - 30X as your multiple you have a price in 10 years between $120B - $300B, which is 4X-12.5X return in 10 years.\n\nI feel that there is a decent case to be made here for 10X return in 10 years (in today's dollars) so I am fine holding it, and I think it helps balance out my TSLA investment a bit, on the off-chance that solid-state just totally destroys Tesla's lead. However, if the battery production levels are much lower and costs higher, this thing might never go up much. I am thinking about possibly selling my position if it takes a steep runup well over $100 in the short-term. I would have to evaluate how soon I think they would have further positive news as barring news would not be surprised to see it fall back down.

No shortage of great ideas that will pay off. Identifying them before they take off is the challenge!\n\nI invested in TSLA a few years back when it was far from certain they would avoid bankruptcy. I believed that EV's were going to change things and Tesla had a chance. Only later on, say around battery day time, did I become very firmly convinced that they had a long way to grow. But they were already way up by then.\n\nIf I had to think of another company that might have amazing performance, I think Palantir (PLTR). Their software is like some form of Google Search on steroids that as best as I can understand allows you to analyze and visualize all different types of data in ways that nothing else comes close to. I think this means that as one company uses their software and benefits from it, it will push competitors to also use it in order to remain competitive. Hence that reflexivity will help drive them higher and higher. Will it mean that their profits one day will be 40B+ easily justifying a 500B (10X) market cap, I can't say, but I think they might have a good chance at that. Really hard to say. I am pretty certain that such a groundbreaking product has to easily, eventually justify their current market cap so one way or another I think a solid investment.\n\nI have a mix of stock and LEAPs in PLTR. My once concern with all these options that gets overlooked a bit is if the market as a whole tanks then multiples or values things trade out will overall be down and can mean options become worthless.
