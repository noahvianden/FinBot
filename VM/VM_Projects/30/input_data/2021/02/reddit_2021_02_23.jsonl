{"title": "Journey to $1 Million - February 22nd, 2021", "selftext": "It was another bloody day in the markets and my portfolio took another hit. Today I am down 7.4% or $55,000. Considering most of these losses came from my long term holds, my options positions were not as bad as I expected them to be. Surprisingly, I took some profit on some positions yesterday.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wr48quqxq4j61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=73e6de18a3c9ee7e3b666d928a0990a0f93ae359\n\n \n\nPositions filled:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mgp6vgwyq4j61.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=13378027a6634822730f77f0781bba8a7fe54302\n\n Current Positions: (moving away from excel and just posting screenshots) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0t80a6xzq4j61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2326288dec973d1fb03a27f00575038d422076a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ccqz31l0r4j61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=c563b101931d0a3b53510051d9f383383852ff5a\n\nIt is to bad I didn't have enough time to pick up any of the hedges we were discussing yesterday! I'll be looking more into some for the QQQ, SPY and DIA. \n\nIn times like these, I tend to DCA the longer term positions, like my ARKG or AAPL LEAPS for example. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nThe tech sector took a hard hit today with the DOW managing a small gain. The rising inflation and bond yields were eventually going to get priced in; there was little doubt it would not. Also, the Biden stimulus was finally confirmed but that more benefitted the DOW than tech. \n\nThere is nothing that I would like to add to the watchlist today as I prefer to dollar cost average my bigger positions on days like today, especially tech. Tomorrow let's see if we see a small bounce back and if we do, I don't expect this week to finish out green for tech. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Notable Mentions:** \n\n$**SPCE**: Virgin Galactic is down and almost into my buy zone again. I have sold a put with a strike of $46. If you don't already own some SPCE, this could be a great chance for you to get some exposure. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/91lls5m4r4j61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e4fbcad3f2c37fcc635a1153a74ecb5a2738e3d\n\n$**CCIV**: This is another on that is coming up to my support. The deal with Lucid was confirmed, however it sent the stock plummeting. If you recall, I was taking advising to take profits when it was up past $50. Hopefully, most people do take consistent profits and now are at a good spot to buy back into it.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v18okcu5r4j61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=aaa1e56073d157254d1cea26c202284f1bf74110\n\n$**NET**: Cloudfare on discount and at my support. If you don't already have exposure, this is a good chance to enter.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g2v2nb37r4j61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=522d46ca40795812ba002346288e408d9cbbd691\n\n$**NNDM**: Nano Dimensions, the Israeli 3-D printing play, is approaching the lower, stronger support. I've got a buy order for commons at $12 GTC, so hoping I'll be able to lower my cost basis a little bit.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w9b8krz8r4j61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=90e3769fafc32c41b30298b51b458419d7dc006e\n\n \n\nKeep in mind, when dollar cost averaging don't spend all your available capital in one or two days. Make sure you can afford to keep buying for more than a week (or more) of consecutive down days. Good luck trading everyone and relax a little bit tonight! \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nNote: Risk (1 out of 5) is my opinion of how risky the stock and these plays are; 1 being the lowest and 5 is the highest. \n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nDisclaimer: The comments opinions and analysis expressed herein are for informational and educational purpose only and should not be considered as individual advice or recommendations.", "id": "lq5p9v", "created_utc": 1614043783.0, "score": 92, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "I find myself waiting for your to post on a daily basis.

{"title": "Key upcoming market considerations, GME, bonds, Powell, stimulus", "selftext": "1. We have been going through a minor correction the last few days due to rapid rising of bond yields and so there will be a lot of focus on Powell's hearing tomorrow and Thursday. My feeling is that Powell will continue to be consistent in his message that his priority is to boost the economy/market and that inflation is not a concern at this moment and that there is no consideration of rising interest rates. If this does happen, I think we will go right back into heavy green the rest of the month. There are a lot of ppl smarter than me on WSB so I'd love to hear contrary opinions or agreements or whatever you all think.\n2. Do not expect hedge funds in any shape or form to get punished or held accountable by any government agency. It is all a show. We cannot count on any government incompetent and corrupt officials to do anything to make things fair.  If you need proof, just go back and look at the Bernie Maddoff story. The one Greek financial analyst reported fraud TEN times to the SEC for like 8 years in a row. In some ways, he was kind of like the DFV before DFV, another legend but a different situation. Regardless, the SEC did NOTHING each time. Maddoff was a hedge fund guy operating a HUGE 20B+ ponzi scheme and still the SEC did NOTHING. The only reason he was even actually caught was when the credit crunch caused the ponzi scheme to fall apart and Maddoff turned himself in. The SEC Is a bunch of pansies when it comes to going after the rich. They are owned by the rich. They only come after the smaller poorer people. The other hedge funds new it was fraud too but the only reason they didn't complain was out of fear that their own fraud would be exposed by brining in regulators. The vast majority of hedge funds are all BS and a house of cards. There is no government agencies that will do shit against them ever. We apes/autists/retards are all we have and we must continue to do the work and fight. We must beat them at their own game with better data and better research. This is just a discussion board but its up to each of us individually to make the best decisions that make sense for each of your respective situations. But pay attention to what those hedge funds do, what public info they release, what they are shorting, etc. Beat them at their own game and bang their wives as you are doing it. THAT is the goal. \n3. Despite point #2, there is plenty of hope and I am optimistic about GME. Remember, these hedge funds also shorted Tesla all year long as admitted by hedge fund douche Gabe last week. Surely, they tried manipulation there too in order to artificially keep the price down. But, Tesla was and is too strong. They could not keep it down forever and then they eventually had to pay the price which initiated a whole bunch of short squeezes as Tesla mooned to crazy highs. I'm not saying GME is guaranteed to follow that path but, with some good news from RC and with some solid strategic steps, GME can break out. It just needs some catalysts and then some momentum. Patience is key here for those who truly believe in GME as I do. Earnings is coming up in March and some good news could go a long way in sparking another gamma squeeze. I will point out that, even though Melvin shorted Tesla last year, they still had a very solid year and made a lot of money, I believe I read it was around $500M for 2020 so they will still find other ways to manipulate other things to cover themselves. Whether its using their media puppets, their short reporting buddies like Shitron, short ladders, ETF underhanded shorting or whatever else, they have a lot of shady dirty tools in their bag.  Regardless, when it comes to GME, we can still win this battle if we believe in GME. This is not financial advice and people should only be all in if they believe in GME and can afford to be in it.\n4. The stimulus looms large. Congress has estimated a stimulus delivered around March.  Some say it is already priced in but I don't agree.  I think the combination of the stimulus combined with market reopening has the potential to really take this market to record new highs. This however will  not last for the whole year IMHO because inflation concerns will certainly creep up again once we get to the highs.  If my predictions come true and we do get record highs, it will be time to consider the \"Sell in May and Go Away\" philosophy.  I will admit this is prediction is just an estimated guess and I again invite those who are much smarter than me to weigh in on whether they agree with this prediction or things its completely off base. \n5. Mining stocks like MARA and Riot are interesting and I am watching them. Ever since Telsa announced its investment, there has been wild speculation that Apple could follow. Perhaps it is better to just buy the coin instead of the mining companies. That I do not know. I will say that I think it is absolutely a strong possibility that one day these coins will replace the US dollar as the global reserve currency.  Maybe I am just retarded in thinking that but I think its possible.  \n\nThat is all I got. I again invite all those who are far  smarter than me to rip apart any of these points or to agree with me or to just comment their expertise.

Well go do your DD if you don’t understand why.

Even with the future rises of inflation, due to the base standard and the increase in demand from the opening up post covid.  \nHe also said something interesting and insightful of when we will see Interest rates rise. When Unemployment goes down. Some background information is that before COVID the Fed was constantly talking about how minorities and lower wealth people were adding to the recovery of the Economic state of the US.   \nI personally don’t think JPOW is going to hike interest rates until the unemployment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Strategy:** \n\nI think there is going to be a major pull back 10% or so in the economy when people see heightened inflation rates this April or May. I have SPY puts expiring JUNE.\n\nGoing to monitor Unemployment rates and Interest rates closely. When the lower quartile of wealths unemployment decreases to near average or TOtal unemployment rates, I will probably enter bear mode, and buy PUTs on the majority of the market.

My understanding of the former is that you can only be evicted for reasons unrelated to financial problems (i.e. engaging in criminal behavior will still get you evicted).\n\nObviously, when the rubber hits the road, nothing is perfect. Entropy, etc. I imagine that some renters are being evicted when they shouldn't be, and that some homeowners are asking for forbearance when they haven't really been impacted, but I can see a future in which \"UBI\" as defined above is implemented through some permanently-renewed system of subsidies that arises as the result of all this financial jiggery. \n\nAnyway, if you can shed some light on that figure of 1,000,000+ rental evictions you mention I'm interested in reading more.
