{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, Sept 28, 2021", "selftext": " \n\n**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, September 28, 2021**\n\nStocks sank today, as technology stocks plummeted, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) having its worst day since March as investors nervously eye a swift rise in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, a disappointing consumer confidence report, and power shortages in China that threaten the global supply chain as the busy Christmas season approaches, along with the evolving Evergrande situation. \n\nMarket participants continue to diest development coming out of Washington.  Congress members continue to race in order to pass legislation to fund the government until next year and prevent the government from defaulting and shutting down. This comes amid a backdrop of ongoing debates surrounding the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal. Last night, Republicans refused to pass a bill to avert a government shutdown and raise or suspend the debt limit to prevent the US from defaulting on its debts. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times since 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would not provide the Republican votes necessary.\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-congress-government-funding-e7bfe8a6ffdb40a8d33e17ef11ded7a7\n\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose to 1.54% at the time of writing, the highest level since June. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks, like technology, the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunities to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. While higher yields are generally seen as a bet on a strengthening economic environment, it does make it more expensive to borrow capital, which weighs heavily on growth stocks, which are valued heavily based on future earnings projections.\n\nChris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG Group, said ‚Äúthe prospect of higher energy prices, fueling inflation, and rises in bond yields appear to be pre-empting tighter monetary policy by central banks, have prompted widespread selling across global stock markets. Like yesterday, it is the highly-valued growth stocks that have taken the brunt of the selling, as investors fret that a lower growth, tighter policy environment will hurt these previous star performers.‚Äù \n\nAccording to a report by the Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, US consumer confidence fell to a seven-month low amid the surge in coronavirus Delta variant cases (which are finally starting to fall again), supply chain issues, and a slowdown in growth rates moving forward. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 109.3 this month from 115.2 in August, the third straight monthly decline. Lynne Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board said, ‚ÄúThese back-to-back declines suggest consumers have grown more cautious and are likely to curtail spending going forward‚Äù.\n\n[https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm](https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm)\n\nIn other news,  a series of power cuts and even blackouts across eastern China, where most of the population lives as demand threatens to outstrip the country‚Äôs electrical supply, adding a new threat to the already slowing economy and likely further snarling already disrupted global supply chains ahead of the busy Christmas season. This can already be seen in the sky-high charter rates for container ships, which have risen 10 out of the last 13 days and have more than quadrupled since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\n[https://www.tradewindsnews.com/bulkers/capesize-bulker-rates-remain-tight-amid-supply-demand-tension/2-1-1073904](https://www.tradewindsnews.com/bulkers/capesize-bulker-rates-remain-tight-amid-supply-demand-tension/2-1-1073904)\n\nThere are several reasons why electricity is in short supply. As more regions in the world reopen from pandemic-induced lockdowns, demand has skyrocketed, forcing already electricity-hungry companies to use more power. Export demand for aluminum, steel, and concrete, three of the most energy-intensive products, has been very strong domestically and abroad. Moreover, as electricity demand rises, it has pushed the price of coal, which is the main way China generates electricity, higher. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Tuesday the Chinese government is blocking its domestic airlines from buying \"tens of billions of dollars\" in airplanes. Raimondo said in remarks after a speech in Washington that China is not abiding by commitments to buy U.S. goods it made in 2020 as part of a trade deal. \"I don't know if Boeing is here... There are tens of billions of dollars of planes that Chinese airlines want to buy but the Chinese government is standing in the way.\"\n* Disney (DIS) and Amazon (AMZN) announced they were partnering together to launch an Alexa-powered voice assistant called ‚ÄúHey Disney‚Äù which will be available at home Echo‚Äôs as well as the ones located in Disney resorts and hotels\n* Netflix (NFLX) released five new mobile gaming titles to subscribers in select European markets, as the company attempts to diversify revenue sources. The company has introduced \"Stranger Things: 1984\", \"Stranger Things 3: The Game\", \"Card Blast\", \"Teeter Up\", and \"Shooting Hoops\" titles on Android to Netflix members in Spain and Italy.\n* Following a ruling by the CCP, Alibaba (BABA) and other internet companies can no longer omit competitors‚Äô products from their own platforms in an effort to increase competition. As a result, Alibaba has now added rival Tencent (TCEHY) WeChat payment system in some of its platforms. \n* According to a joint report by consulting firms JD Power and LMC Automotive, new vehicle sales in the US are expected to fall a staggering 25% compared to last year, just the latest example of the effect the global shortage in semiconductors is having in the automotive industry. New-vehicle retail sales in the United States are seen dropping to 888,900 units in September, from 1,182,788 a year ago.\n* Ford Motor Co and its Korean battery partner SK Innovation will invest $11.4 billion to build an electric F-150 assembly plant and three battery plants in the United States, accelerating the U.S. automaker's push into electric vehicles.\n* **\\*\\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\\*\\***\n* Costco (COST) target raised by Citigroup from $460 to $495 at Neutral.
