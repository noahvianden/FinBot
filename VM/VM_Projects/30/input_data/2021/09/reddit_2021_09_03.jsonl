I know ~~half~~ over half of you can't read, so I'll keep it short here. Essentially, through a combination of the Elliott Wave theory, Fibonacci retracements, and an SMA on the one-month chart for SPY, Roman theorized a market crash was coming. It was a great post and it opened a lot of eyes to the potential for a major (and I mean major) correction, but there's only one issue. His model showed the peak would be at $420.69. While this is very nice, SPY has already shot past that and the market is still popping off. Clearly something was wrong here, but I don't think it was conceptually too far off. I hit the books (TradinigView) and came up with this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Like Roman's, but this one is actually correct](https://preview.redd.it/0lxugkfzccl71.png?width=1566&format=png&auto=webp&s=8db298ac642d91c8372a8f33e6fc358fa53a5267)\n\nIf you know anything about TA, you'll know that the thing on the right is volume. Roman tried to line up the Fibonacci lines with price action, which was unsuccessful. Not only did the estimate prove to be wrong, but the lines didn't really match up with any of the peaks or valleys. Here's my innovation: I matched the Fibonacci lines with spikes in volume rather than extreme pricing. Notice how, with the exception of 0.618, every single ratio lines up almost perfectly with a spike in volume. Knowing this, there are 2 potential places where price might consolidate and fall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a more detailed explanation, click [here](https://youtu.be/BNeUI7pqEtk).
