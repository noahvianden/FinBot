With the SPY about **$468**, that corresponds to just above **$473** on the upside and around **$463** on the downside.\n\n**Implied Volatility** – The VIX ended Friday around 16.50, up slightly from the week before and up a bit to end the week from lows it saw under 15 mid week. The VIX remains below its historical average entering this week.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\nOptions are pricing similar market moves this week than they priced last week. Here are the expected moves for the week in the major ETFs:\n\n* SPY **1%**\n* QQQ **1.5%**\n* IWM **2.0%**\n* DIA **1.1%**\n\nAs an example of how the 1% expected move translates into strike selections, here’s an Iron Condor with short strikes set at the expected move (based on the close Friday).

He followed with a tweet saying he would abide by the poll. “Yes” won. It’s unclear what would happen next, as Twitter polls are generally not considered legally binding.

{"title": "Could it be time to catapult into $KPLT KATAPULT, Earnings November 9th, we will see if the growth is real, maybe a way to play is with options, this was recently tied with AFRM, AMZN, which were rumors until AFRM did have a deal/contract", "selftext": "Good morning everyone and thank you so much for reading this post. KPLT is a recent spac and was heavy in the media do to its nature of business. Katapult Holdings, Inc., an e-commerce focused financial technology company, provides e-commerce point-of-sale lease-purchase options for sub prime consumers in the United States. The company's technology platform provides sub prime consumers with a lease purchase option to enable them to obtain durable goods from its network of e-commerce merchants. This is because AFRM which I had loved has been all over the news with their ease of use with allowing users to make payments monthly and buy their goods. AFRM is near a 50 billion valuation and KPLT is 400 million. \n\nNo, I am not like most redditors I am not suggesting that this is AFRM and that this is going to 10 billion even. I am simply saying it is time to at least look, maybe buy shares and options. As a bonus this is 30+% short. The nature of their business is they specialize in consumers that do not have the best credentials. The sub prime field. AFRM does not normally do this, it takes a different view/culture/customer service to deal with this customer. So when KPLT/AFRMwere tied into AMZN, the combination with heavy squeeze this sky rocketed to 20! I am not saying that that will happen again but 6-7 is fairly reasonable and if you do not want to risk money in the shares you can also buy options, a much more affordable bet.\n\nMuch of DD on Reddit has speculation and hope, there is nothing wrong with that, however, I am very old fashioned and traded since the 90s. I do not mean to be rude by telling me company X is going to cure cancer, is an old story. You need to tell me and show my proof why company X is curing cancer and for me, it cant be, well this is in the works, these patents, and these deals will make it a target for JNJ or Pfizer, that is not good enough… So I say this because I believe in numbers and you can go straight to the Katapult website to see. Their site is great by the way. This is off their last report\n\n  \n\nThree Months Ended   June 30,\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSix Months Ended   June 30,\n\n  \n\n2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2020\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2020\n\n \n\nRevenue\n\n \n\nRental revenue\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$\n\n&#x200B;\n\n77,237 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n$\n\n&#x200B;\n\n59,986 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n$\n\n&#x200B;\n\n157,862 \n\n&#x200B;\n\n$\n\n&#x200B;\n\n102,564 \n\n\n\nThey lost 17 cents a share in the 2nd quarter but increased sales 50% year over year.

So the last quarter they had 77 million in sales and lost 8 million \\[17 cents a share\\] if they keep growing these sales the bottom line will look better and better. In 2020 the company was profitable but did not grow at these rates. It does cost money to grow.\n\nI am not saying you must buy KPLT, but now may be the time to add it to a watch list or maybe take a small bet on options. \n\nGood luck and happy trading!", "id": "qotomu", "created_utc": 1636307202.0, "score": 62, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "Join the r/smallstreetbets official Discord here - https://discord.gg/E27dUNUwfx\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "Technical Analysis on HIMX indicates that now is the time to buy!", "selftext": "**Summary**\n\nTechnical analysis indicates that now is an excellent time to buy into HIMX. As shown in the chart below, HIMX is breaking out of a four-month long decline and buying now allows an entry point that comes with low downside risk. Moreover, this break-out is occurring in November, exactly one year from the break-out that occurred last November.  Comparing the two break-outs suggests that strong gains lie ahead for HIMX.\n\n**$10 Support Held**\n\nHIMX has a support at $10 that has been tested multiple times this year (see chart). This support first started as a resistance (point 1), which then switched to a support that was subsequently tested six times (points 2-7). In general, the more a support is tested and holds, the stronger it gets. For example, at point 6, the support was breached and HIMX closed below $10. However, the very next trading session HIMX recovered and closed above $10. In subsequent trading sessions the $10  support was tested but not breached (point 7). If a support is breached, but subsequent trading sessions fail to confirm this breach, the support is considered to have held.  The chart shows that the $10 support has held pretty much throughout 2021.\n\n**Downward Channel Broken**\n\nHIMX has been in a downward channel since July 1, forming a descending flag  pattern. However, HIMX broke out of this pattern between Oct. 28 - Nov. 1, which is right where the upper channel line intersects the $10 support. A break-out at this location is not coincidental and very bullish for HIMX, especially given the strong post-earnings follow-through on Nov. 5. In fact, this break-out mirrors the start of the break-out that happened back in November 2020. Again, very bullish.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAfter months of decreasing prices, HIMX has formed a reversal that is turning into a strong break-out. This break-out will especially accelerate if the bears capitulate and close out their short positions. (As of October 15, the short interest is 24,652,040 shares or 14.1% of the public float.) I have already posted about the lure of HIMX’s FY-2021 dividend, which will most likely be above $1.92 per share and correspond to a 16+% forward yield. But there is one other thing to consider.  (Click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HIMX/comments/qns9ow/if_you_are_interested_in_himx_now_is_the_time_to/) to read post on dividends.)\n\nThe  market is heading into December, a time in which many investors and institutions re-balance their stock portfolios for the next year. Such re-balancing includes investors and institutions reducing their exposure to stocks that performed well but have become overextended.  The resulting profits are rotated into undervalued names. HIMX is deeply undervalued relative to virtually all other semiconductor stocks. For example, AMD and NVDA have forward PE ratios of 41.04 and 63.74,  respectively, while HIMX has a forward PE ratio of about 4.7. As such, HIMX is going to garner a lot of buying interest in December due to its ridiculously low PE, strong projected 2022 revenues, expanding 2022 margins, and mind-boggling 16+% forward yield.\n\nThe bottom line here is to get in early before HIMX really starts to move.  If Friday’s (Nov. 5) price action is any indication, investors liked  what management had to say during their earnings call (Nov. 4) and more will buy into HIMX as the word starts to spread. The technical analysis shown in the chart below indicates that now is an excellent entry point in HIMX and comes with low downside risk.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/do5hfsnc54y71.png?width=2188&format=png&auto=webp&s=fca05903794baa85ae71ad38152bd3c8fa21fa96", "id": "qoie78", "created_utc": 1636264612.0, "score": 71, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "It’s a great stock to own and it’s never to late to get on the train", "score": 13, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's been a long wait but finally $HIMX is breaking out.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I hope we have good volume to kill all the shorts", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "ChInA is GOInG TO inVade.
