This is a great test too.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "**Prediction: Tesla+SpaceX could become a mobile service provider (!).**\n\nSuperchargers are conveniently located and can host cells. Tesla would have to add a few more cells on towers to improve/complete coverage. Maybe add an antenna tower at Superchargers that require it.\n\nA Tesla Megapack + Tesla solar array + Starlink = perpetual, low maintenance GSM cell without any fiber connectivity required ... Whatever it charges during the day, it can use in the night. Should work even in the winter.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "They probably just contract with another provider to be an MVNO and lease tower space.

Hilariously wrong take. So bad it‚Äôs funny.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "It‚Äôll probably be cheaper. Remember that there is quite a lot of cross pollination and resource sharing between the two. Not only does SpaceX use Tesla batteries and motors to power the electronics and fins on their prototypes but they also share the same materials science team responsible for spacex‚Äôs new stainless steel alloy and Tesla‚Äôs aluminum alloy that they use in their mega casts. My tenant works at Tesla and he told his supervisor he wants to work at SpaceX so they started to train him on the robotics line so that he has the experience to get a job there. His current job is to load software on the y which has no transferable skill.

Tesla is in a pretty good financial position right now.\n\nFor one it creates a minimum level of demand with a consistent large long term customer, none of which Starlink has right now. Many telcos would kill for Tesla's business and give a discount for that. One enormous customer is worth way more to Starlink than that same amount of bandwidth used for a huge number of small customers.
