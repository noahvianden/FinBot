Top Gun, Transformers, and Mission Impossible are all set to release early in 2022 which can potentially bring in lots of money, along with major Paramount+ releases like Yellowstone:1883, Halo, more Southpark movies, and a new Star Trek series that aims to fix the flaws with Discovery. \n\nHalo Infinite just released as well and getting extremely popular and Paramount's Halo series release is perfectly set to take advantage of the sudden popularity increase of Halo. Look at what happened with League of Legends and Netflix's release of Arcane. Excellent potential there. \n\nIn addition PlutoTV is quickly cementing its lead as the most watched AVOD service in the world, with AVOD cagr of over 20% by 2025 this segment of streaming is going to be huge internationally which will continue to pull in advertising money. [Just take a look at how fast its growing, +30% traffic in 6 months with a positive growth curve](https://www.similarweb.com/website/pluto.tv/#overview)\n\nParamount+ was one of the fastest growing SVOD services in Q3, adding 4.3 million subscribers and growing faster than even Netflix (which had similar account adds). \n\nThey added over 1 million subscribers in under a week just recently in November, and they have over 48 million subscribers worldwide and undergoing further international expansion. The release of Star Trek internationally (it was previously restricted to US) is guaranteed to accelerate subscriber adds even faster. \n\nQ4 is going to be a monster quarter for Paramount+ with Yellowstone, Southpark, Star Trek, Dexter, and Mayor of Kingstown all releasing Q4. \n\nAnd broadcast? It's NOT dead yet. Yellowstone pulled in over 12 million viewers, higher than Game of Thrones ever did. Adele's special pulled in over 9 million viewers as well. 2 smash hits in a row that both broke records. Also new data revealed that [Broadcast pulled even with Streaming](https://www.adweek.com/blognetwork/broadcast-pulls-even-with-streaming-in-october-tv-usage/92781) in October with 28% share each (while all other forms of viewing shrank). \n\nDon't get me wrong - I'm not trying to bash NFLX I like the stock too. But the valuation difference between these two is insane when both have so much international growth. \n\nI see so much turnaround potential and yet this stock seems to get zero interest from buyers.
