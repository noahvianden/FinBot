Most every broker will do the same if you don’t have the cash or margin available to exercise.  They may do it a bit later in the day, but if you don’t have the cash to exercise it’s on you. \n\nI would suggest closing options that are easily a coin flip earlier in the day or even Thursdays.  What if the price ended above 635, you would have been worse off, correct?  In hindsight, you were probably looking at a decent gain Thursday when price was still a bit under 620 near the end of the day before spiking at the close, correct? It appears you got greedy trying to get your max gain out of the spread, when closing then would have been the safer play.  Either that or you wrote the spread Thursday or today and were gambling.  Or what about closing today before 11am when pps was still at 625 or less?  You gambled on todays action NOT moving above 630 and lost, now you are crying and blaming RH instead of how you played the credit spread.  Could you have profited, broke even or minimized your losses at <625 this morning?
