{"title": "APHA & TLRY Holders - Don’t panic! Here's what happens to stocks when mergers close...", "selftext": "Disclaimer: This is not financial advice, do you own research. \n\n**TL;DR – Some brokers are taking their sweet time with these shares. MOST companies are down day after a merger and then rebound in the coming weeks. Sit tight!**\n\nOk, so we’ve all figured out what happens to our APHA and TLRY shares now that the merger is closed (Right? Right!). If you’re still confused, check out [THIS post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Aphria/comments/n3uylv/still_dont_know_what_is_happening_to_your_apha/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from earlier. \n\nFeedback on my prior post is that SOME brokers have changed your position to reflect your TLRY shares (TD Ameritrade for the win) and some have not (get your shit together, RH). Either way, you will get those shares (hopefully) soon and all will be well with the world.\n\nBUT WAIT! TLRY is down $1.20 today… WTF?!? \n\nA few things to note - There are a lot of market dynamics at play here:\n\n1. There were hedge funds with prior positions that now need to rebalance. \n\n2. There are people who were only holding on the APHA for the merger and now want to sell.\n\n3. There are ETFs that will likely have some sort of rebalancing.\n\n4. Shorts may be covering on the weakness today.\n\n5. This is a liquidity event – expect volatility.\n\nWe can expect a decent amount of choppiness around TLRY the next few days. “But grey\\_patagonia\\_vest how do you know?!?” Well kids, I did some good old fashion data analysis. \n\nI pulled a list of all mergers with the following criteria:\n\n1. Both target and acquirer are publicly traded on a North American exchange\n\n2. The deal terms (like APHA/TLRY) were either all stock or at least some cash and some stonks\n\n3. Any mergers with an equity value >$500mm USD (some of the smaller ones can get funky)\n\nI then looked at the performance of the acquirer (like TLRY in this case) – after the deal closed. I started with the stock price of the acquirer 30 trading days before the merger closed, then looked at 7 days before, one day before, one day after, one week after, one month after, three months after, six months after and finally a year after. Here is what I found…. \n\nOf the 214 deals that fit this criteria… \\~56% of acquirer stocks were down the day after a merger closed (as measured from the day before), so TLRY is in good company. Of these 56%, the companies were down an AVERAGE of 3% (TLRY currently down \\~6%). Then, of those companies that were down on day one, 19% of them were back up after a week, 38% after a month and 48% after 3M. Those 48% that were up after 3M were up an average of 14% from the day before the merger. If TLRY behaved that way, we’d see TLRY @ $20.90 before long. \n\nWhat does this mean for TLRY? It takes some time.
