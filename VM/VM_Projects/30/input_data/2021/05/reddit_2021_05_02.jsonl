{"title": "The American Jobs Plan, How it Will be Paid, and What it Means for the Stock Market", "selftext": "Here's some charts that distribute the allocations of President Biden's $2T Infrastructure Plan or [**American Jobs Plan**](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/31/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan/). Dollar value is approximate.\n\nSince r/stocks doesn't allow images to be upload, you will have to see all my sub-par looking charts [here](https://imgur.com/a/yJF6dOH). \n\nMore details on how the American Jobs Plan...\n\n* [Empowers and Protects Workers](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/23/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan-empowers-and-protects-workers/)\n* [Support Women's Employment](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/21/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan-will-support-womens-employment/)\n* [Supports Veterans](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/15/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan-supports-veterans/)\n* [Supports Small Businesses](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/13/fact-sheet-the-american-jobs-plan-supports-small-businesses/)\n\n**Who is going to pay for this?**\n\nWe the people. Well more like we the 1%ers. And corporations. \n\nAgain, I made more [charts](https://imgur.com/a/zFFfyGJ) to visualize it a bit better. \n\nSo unless you're a high earner, this won't affect you (much). I made these charts about a week or two ago but I heard for the American Families Plan, individuals earning more than $452,700 and married couples earning more than $509,300 (meaning each partners could earn less than $400,000) could see a tax increase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What do you mean, \"won't affect you (much)\"?**\n\nIf there's tax increases for the rich, what will the rich do? They'll take their stock market gains before the tax increases. 2020 saw huge gains so we may see a correction in the coming months. How much of a correction you ask? I don't know but I would guess 10-15% in the broader market. More if you're into speculative high growth stocks. I say that because I know a lot of you have positions on them. Careful how you invest these next few months.\n\nAnd if there's tax increases for corporations, obviously they'll do whatever they can to avoid them. However even a 1% increase in their taxes (note below I mention that many corporations pay very little taxes because of loopholes) will affect their bottom line. This means earnings will be less and therefore lower stock valuations.\n\n**So if the rich sell and corporations are being taxed more, how will that affect the stock market?**\n\n1. Less incentive to invest due to more taxes. People will look to other investments or stay cash. (Seriously though, the tax plan won't make a huge difference unless you're a 1%er.)\n2. Bonds become more [favorable](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/taxes/government-bonds#:~:text=Income%20from%20bonds%20issued%20by%20state%2C%20city%2C%20and%20local%20governments,where%20the%20bond%20was%20issued). Income from bonds issued by state, city, and local governments (municipal bonds, or munis) is generally free from federal taxes. You will, however, have to report this income when filing your taxes. Examples: MUB, HYD, VOHIX, VWAHX.\n3. ETFs and Mutual funds are more favorable. They both are taxed at the long-term capital gains rate of 0%, 15%, and 20% depending on your earnings. ETFs, however, have an advantage over mutual funds due to three reasons: 1) 2018, 89% of ETFs were passive vs. 4% of mutual funds. Less trading involved with passive. 2) Any high dividend or high interest paying securities will receive more distributions, therefore a high tax bill. 3) ETFs have greater liquidity as they are traded during market hours vs. mutual funds are traded at the beginning and end of market sessions.\n\n\\*In 2018, Goldman Sachs did a study that showed 100% of their ETFs did not pay capital gains. Broadly, 90% of ETFs did not pay capital gains compared to 39% of mutual funds.\n\n4. Tax advantaged accounts like Roth IRA and 401K are more favorable. If you're one of the super rich, take a look at the [backdoor Roth IRA](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/backdoor-roth-ira.asp). It's a way for super rich people to put money into retirement without the contribution limits. Roth IRA contribution limit is $6,000 per year. BUT if you make more than $140,000 as a single or $206,000 filing jointly as married then you cannot contribute to a Roth IRA. The easiest way to get by this is converting a traditional IRA account to a Roth IRA account.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat does history [say](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/tax-hikes-history#:~:text=In%20the%2013%20previous%20instances,the%20data%20in%20the%20calendar) about stock market performance after tax increases?\n\n\"In the 13 previous instances of tax increases just since 1950, the S&P 500, the stock index that tracks most of the major companies in the US, has shown higher average returns, and higher odds of an advance, in times when taxes are increasing, according to Chisholm's research, which analyzed the data in the calendar year of the tax changes, plus the year prior and year after. This pattern holds true even when you drill down into key sectors of the S&P 500.\" Here's a [chart](https://i.imgur.com/2MaBjOp.png) of the S&P500 performance after tax increases. Not too bad eh?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What's happening now with the current tax law?**\n\n* 91 Fortune 500 companies paid $0 in federal corporate taxes. Amazon, Chevron, Halliburton, and IBM are some of those companies. Corporate tax rate is currently 21%.\n* 56 Fortune 500 companies paid 0-5% on their 2018 income.\n* 2017 tax bill cut the average rate that corporations paid in half from 16 percent to less than 8 percent in 2018. I couldn't find any data on this but its due to loopholes in the tax system.\n\n**The Made in America Tax plan**\n\n* Will raise over $2 trillion over the next 15 years and more than pay for the mostly one-time investments in the American Jobs Plan and then reduce deficits on a permanent basis.\n* Increase corporate tax rate at 28% from 21%\n* Right now, the tax code rewards U.S. multinational corporations that shift profits and jobs overseas with a tax exemption for the first ten percent return on foreign assets, and the rest is taxed at half the domestic tax rate.\n* The proposal will increase the minimum tax on U.S. corporations to 21 percent and calculate it on a country-by-country basis so it hits profits in tax havens. It will also eliminate the rule that allows U.S. companies to pay zero taxes on the first 10 percent of return when they locate investments in foreign countries.\n* The United States is now seeking a global agreement on a strong minimum tax through multilateral negotiations.\n* Invert the current law in which U.S. corporations can acquire or merge with a foreign company to avoid U.S. taxes by claiming to be a foreign company, even though their place of management and operations are in the United States.\n* A proposal that companies can no longer write off expenses that come from offshoring jobs. Instead a tax credit will be proposed to support onshoring jobs.\n* Invert a Trump tax law for “Foreign Derived Intangible Income” (FDII), which gave corporations a tax break for shifting assets abroad and is ineffective at encouraging corporations to invest in R&D. Instead the revenue will be used to expand more effective R&D investment incentives.\n* Enact a minimum tax of 15% on large corporations’ book income.\n* Eliminate tax preferences (worth billions of dollars) for fossil fuels and make sure polluting industries pay for environmental clean up.\n* Increase enforcement for tax evasion. Typical workers’ wages are reported to the IRS and their employer withholds, so they pay all the taxes they owe. By contrast, large corporations have at their disposal loopholes they exploit to avoid or evade tax liabilities, and an army of high-paid tax advisors and accountants who help them get away with this. At the same time, an under-funded IRS lacks the capacity to scrutinize these suspect tax maneuvers: A decade ago, essentially all large corporations were audited annually by the IRS; today, audit rates are less than 50 percent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So what should I do to prepare if this bill passes?**\n\nNothing different honestly. Keep investing. DCA - dollar cost average if your stocks drop. Stay the course in your high conviction names. De-risk if you have to by investing in safer investments like index funds or ETFs. I know a lot of you are into SPAX (special purpose acquisition companies. I spelled it this way in case this sub banned the real acronym) and other speculative companies. There's almost 500 of them out there. 217 of those were from 2020. To be honest, 1% of those companies will moon. Most of them won't see a return for years. Are you willing to hold them without knowing they will moon in 5-10 years? Some may not even make a return. Make sure you understand market conditions. Stocks really do go up but its only the ones that are backed by strong earnings and potential. Don't get burned. Money is not everything but it's a tool to bring you financial freedom sooner in life.
