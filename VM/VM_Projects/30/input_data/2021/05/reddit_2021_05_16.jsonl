Done. iPhone doesn't take an SD card or any kind of removable media, because they want you to pay a subscription every month for more storage. \n\nA company can make a huge profit squeezing their customers like that, but ultimately people don't like being treated that way. I'm also not alone in seeing this. Just casually listening to my students, I overhear them talking to one another about how Android is so much better than iPhone... and you know how children are the first to pick up on these things.

I hope you all made some good money following the spreadsheet last week, cause it's time to do it all again! Earnings season is slowly coming to an end, so this weeks spreadsheet is a little smaller than prior weeks, but that's alright, there's still money to be made.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll that being said, I fucking love earnings season. It‚Äôs an absolute battleground out there. Insane volatility, breaking announcements, and huge moves being made every single day for weeks at a time. What‚Äôs not to love? Anyone has a chance to pick the correct tickers, roll the dice, and amass a small fortune. That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\n\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Expect larger moves coming out of retailers this week**. Home Depot, Lowe's, Walmart, and Target all have fairly conservative historical moves, but will likely break trend this earnings. Last quarter was fucking *massive* for these retail giants, as the holidays combined with stimulus cheques will likely lead to insane profits among them. Expect a large move to happen for each corresponding retailer, to either the upside or downside.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Lots of Chinese tech companies report this week.** If you're looking for a fun little collateral play, you can take a look at various Chinese tech ETFs and paly options on them. The IV on the ETFs is general lower than the ones on the individual tickers, although most of the tickers move in tandem with one another. If one beats, they usually all beat, and vice versa.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Don't fall for the Solar trap**. Solar has been heavily beat down all throughout earnings season, and as a result you may be inclined to buy Puts. Canadian Solar and Maxeon Solar have both slid extremely far following the movements of their peers throughout earnings, and are likely primed for a reversal. There isn't much farther for these stocks to go down, and as a result, a terrible earnings for both of these companies is already priced in. If they even match estimates, or put up a beat, they will likely move upwards. This exact situation occurred with Nikola two weeks back. I would look to play a neutral to bullish strategy on these tickers.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nObviously, since I gave data on over 50 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe‚Äôve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there‚Äôs a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tiIuvRFHYgqLQpe7HdDYNQ1ZkQGA55gLKc0A_jJQKiQ/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!

No, but its going to have a sweet sweet dividend soon and a nice gradual increase for the years with other boomers flocking to it, yes.
