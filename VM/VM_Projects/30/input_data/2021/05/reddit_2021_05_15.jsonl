{"title": "Huya: severely undervalued.", "selftext": "Huya: The most undervalued company in the market.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/dVC4QND.jpg\n\nWhat is Huya? \n\nHuya is the largest game streaming platform in all of China, it‚Äôs basically the Chinese equivalent of Twitch. \n\nEsports is absolutely huge in China, bigger than in the west, it‚Äôs like a real sport over there. They hold tourneys in giant $900m stadiums and offer substantial cash prizes to winners. This is an industry with strong tailwinds and we know there will only be massive growth for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe majority shareholder of Huya is Tencent, which is great news for Huya because they can buy exclusive streaming rights for all Tencent games like League of Legends and Dota2 as well as exclusive broadcast rights for tournaments, which is creating a very nice moat. Add the network effect and you can forget about anyone ever challenging Huya‚Äôs dominance in the industry. We all know Google and Microsoft could never even compete with Twitch despite sniping the largest streamers Ninja and Shroud, because the network effect for game streaming is just that strong.\n\nSo what makes Huya so undervalued?\n\nWell, just look at these numbers:\n\nMarket Cap: $4b\n\nSales: $1.67b\n\nP/S: 2.4\n\nPE ratio: 28\n\nPEG ratio: 0.3\n\n2020 Revenue growth: 30%\n\n2020 Earnings growth: 89%\n\n5 yr revenue cagr: 20-30%\n\nCash: $1.6b\n\nDebt: $0\n\nCompare these with a somewhat similar company, Bilibili, the Youtube of China.\n\nMarket cap: $37b\n\nSales: $1.8b\n\nP/S: 20.5\n\nPE ratio: 0\n\nPEG ratio: 0\n\n2020 revenue growth: 50%\n\n2020 earnings growth: -118%\n\n5 yr revenue cagr: 35-45%\n\nCash: $2b\n\nDebt: $1.29b\n\nBut why?\n\nHuya had been hit with the perfect storm of terrible news. We all know tech and growth stocks are crashing right now because of inflation, add the fact that Chinese stocks are getting hammered right now because of the new regulations that threaten to delist some of the shadier Chinese companies out there. But that‚Äôs not all, there is something else holding this stock down, a pending merger with their largest competitor Douyu.\n\nThis potential merger would basically double Huya revenue instantly, double the cash on the balance sheet, while giving them a new market cap of roughly $7b, and they would instantly capture 80% of all game streaming market share in China. Basically a monopoly in a hyper growth industry. They could also increase margins substantially with no competition and no need to outbid competitors with large contracts to their streamers to keep them on the platform.\n\nUnder normal circumstances this potential merger would be the most bullish development of all time, but not today. The CCP really doesn‚Äôt like it. They don‚Äôt like Tencent buying up smaller companies within an industry, merging them together, and creating a monopoly. These days it seems like there is an article every day about how the Chinese government is really starting to crack down on Tencent and Alibaba. The Huya Douyu deal is at the center of all of that China stock FUD, and there is a real good chance that this merger gets blocked outright within the next month or two.\n\nThis is bad for Huya? \n\nNot really. Whatever happens, it‚Äôs good for Huya share price. Right now Huya is one of the most shorted stocks in the market. There are a large number of shorts looking to take advantage of the price difference between Huya and Douyu shares, Arbitrage shorts. They will have to cover either way once the merger decision is reached, leaving Huya to run higher once the merger FUD is over. Over time, Huya will rise to reflect the strong fundaments and growth of the company. \n\nThis stock should be 5x the price it is today at a bare minimum.\n\nIf you have a bear case, please share.", "id": "ncotuc", "created_utc": 1621045407.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.55, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "Another recent ipo backed by ten net was waterdrop which ipo d a few weeks ago.

{"title": "The Put Selling Strategy Using Deep ITM Puts", "selftext": "While put selling is indeed a strategy where small amounts of income are earned through selling put options, it doesn‚Äôt always have to be this way. Using the put selling strategy of deep in the money puts allows an investor to capture the rise in a stock while still offering some protection against losses and if applied with a protective put it can guarantee a profitable trade.\n\nThe put selling strategy of using Deep In The Money Puts is a highly profitable strategy to use in bull markets against rising stocks. Surprisingly though, many investors stay away from put selling in a bull market  as they hate the thought of selling a put for perhaps .50 cents to $1.00 only to watch the stock rise $2.00, $3.00. $4.00 or even more leaving them with a very small profit while the ‚Äúbig‚Äù profit escapes them.\n\nWhile many investors are busy chasing the latest hot stock or a high flyer I enjoy using this strategy on large cap dividend paying stocks. While many investors may feel that stocks such as SU or dozens of others are boring, go nowhere stocks, I can attest through my trades that they can be highly profitable and less volatile if the right strategies are applied to them.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3l6c3dhh0cz61.png?width=1144&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6b09754a9241cbfb50546ad9ad93aa4c1ed7832", "id": "nd5ws7", "created_utc": 1621105132.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "Stopped reading at:  \n\n\"...it can guarantee a profitable trade.\"", "score": 63, "replies": []}, {"body": ">if applied with a protective put it can guarantee a profitable trade\n\nNothing can guarantee a profitable trade", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "uhh yeah there is. it's called buying us treasury bills. lollllll.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Factor in inflation and still no...", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "Til the US finally implodes.

I love this idea/strategy. Honestly, I hadn‚Äôt really considered it before this. I currently try to sell slightly ITM puts on red days/very low RSI. It works usually (reputable stocks only so holding is cool, too‚Äîfor the noobs) but though premium is pretty good there, this could allow one to capitalize on a more significant rise in the underlying and still get mad premium, if I‚Äôm thinking about this right.

Agreeing that the premium is good for these plays, the move made by the shares shifts the option quickly and then it‚Äôs buy-to-close time for nice profits. In OP‚Äôs example, the tone seems suggest the underlying is moving pretty significantly related to the initial share price. OP cites .50/1.00 of premium on a presumed common put option sale (common .3 delta, etc. assumed). But if this common OTM put is getting a .75(median) premium, a put that‚Äôs $4-5 ITM will have premium probably approaching 5.00. Though the premium might be ‚Äúless‚Äù as it relates to the value of each strike, selling for a $500 credit to have the share price approach or reach your strike (as in OP‚Äôs example) nets you most of that entire sum as if you‚Äôre riding the shares up. So in my thought process, this allows you to capitalize on that share price difference. Of course, all of this is just assuming the stock cranks north because there‚Äôs not as much shift in the Greeks until you get closer to the money. Alas, the sold put accounts for the example‚Äôs difference at the time of the sale so any shift upward is to your benefit all the way up to your strike (and technically past your strike, but OP is sighting general unwillingness to let the share price escape the seller).
