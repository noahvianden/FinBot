If we look at Q3 alone compared to a company like NVDA who had a massive jump in share price, RKT had income of  3.1B and NVDA 3.4B!

If this pulls back, it will eat their bottom line.  However I believe RKT has the tech to take over the large majority of this market to compensate any relative pullback.

This comes following a report that Omicron has now become the dominant variant in the US, accounting for roughly 73% of all cases reported last week.\n\nNew COVID-19 cases rose 9% in the United States in the past week but are up 57% since the start of December, according to a Reuters tally.
