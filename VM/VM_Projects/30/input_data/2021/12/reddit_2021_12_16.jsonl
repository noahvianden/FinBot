Silvana Tenreyro was the sole dissenter. Policy makers said more “modest” tightening is likely to be needed as inflation heads toward a peak likely to be around 6% in April.\n\n>The pound rallied as much as 0.8% while U.K. 10-year yields jumped 5 basis points after the decision. Traders now see the BOE’s key rate rising to 1% by September.\n\n>The U.S. Federal Reserve already set a hawkish tone on the eve of the BOE announcement by signaling three rate hikes next year and accelerating the wind down of its stimulus program, while Norway kept up its own tightening effort on Thursday with its second increase this year.  \n\n>The BOE’s precipitous shift into tightening mode will surprise the large majority of economists who anticipated no change, and investors who were pricing in around a 40% chance of a move. The outcome was the second in a row featuring a surprise after November’s decision to stay on hold wrong-footed financial markets. \n\n>The BOE hike is a response to the danger posed by surging prices gains, with a report this week showing inflation jumped to 5.1% in November -- more than double the central bank’s target -- and a separate report Tuesday showing U.K. companies added to payrolls at a record pace.\n\n>Considering that backdrop, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief European Economist Jari Stehn told Bloomberg Television just hours earlier that an outcome of no change was “not a done deal,” even though it was his main expectation.\"\n\nThoughts?", "id": "rhppo0", "created_utc": 1639657568.0, "score": 42, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "0.25% lmao still the second lowest rates they have ever had so who really cares", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "> so who really cares\n\nthe market, evidently", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Care = up 1% big fucking deal, do people on this sub always get such a hardon or suicidal for every 1-3% move", "score": -7, "replies": [{"body": "lol chill buddy. its not that serious.", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "lol", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Big money cares", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Agreed.
