{"title": "Psycho Market Recap for Thur Dec 9 2021", "selftext": "**Summary**\n\nThe three day rally in the stock market took a pause, with stocks finishing mostly lower. Market participants continue to digest new data about the Omicron variant, the Weekly Unemployment Report, and look forward to new inflation data being released tomorrow. Weekly unemployment claims showed lowest level since 1969 with 184k claims vs 220k expected.\n\nInvestors continue to assess the risks of Omicron infections, with mixed news about the severity of illness and its response to vaccines. Bloomberg reported that the Omicron variant was found to be 4.2 times more transmissible in its early form compared to the Delta variant. However, reports continue to suggest the severity of the disease is less than originally feared and new early lab results from Pfizer (PFE) showed a third booster shot “neutralizes” the variant.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-09/omicron-found-to-transmit-four-times-more-than-delta-video](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-12-09/omicron-found-to-transmit-four-times-more-than-delta-video)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/health/pfizer-booster-omicron.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/health/pfizer-booster-omicron.html)\n\nBank of America Senior US Equity Strategist Jill Carey said, “The Omicron variant has obviously been a key variable that contributed to the sell-off that we saw, and a lot of uncertainty remains around that, but our colleagues are so far thinking that while much is yet to be known, so far signs point to it not affecting the course of the pandemic dramatically, but obviously there is still a lot we need to hear there.\n\nWith virus concerns diminishing, investors are pivoting their attention back to economic data, awaiting Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures on Friday to assess the extent inflationary pressures will persist.\n\n\"If the Omicron variant was to lead to a resurgence in goods spending at the expense of services or to further complicate supply disruptions, there could be a clear inflationary impact, too,” wrote HSBC economist James Pomeroy earlier this week in a research note to clients. “The inflation news in the past few weeks has been decidedly mixed — with upside surprises in both the U.S. and eurozone being offset by the possibility of some of the supply chain issues starting to alleviate, while energy prices have fallen sharply in recent days.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Lucid Motors (LCID) cratered more than 15% after the company announced it was offering $1.75 billion of convertible senior notes expected to be sold to institutional buyers in a private offering. The decline marks the second nosedive this week for shares of Lucid, which hovered around bear market territory Monday following disclosure of an investigation by the SEC.\n* Shares of Nu Holdings, a Warren Buffet backed Brazilian fin-tech company, IPOd today, closing the day roughly 15% higher. \n* Latest figures from the Commerce Department released Thursday showed wholesale inventories rose 2.3%, slightly more than the 2.2% estimated last month and 14.4% up from a year earlier, as companies stock up for the holiday season.\n* Bad day for meme stocks. Gamestop (GME) stock declined roughly 10% after the company reported earnings. AMC was down roughly 8% in sympathy as well. \n* The chief executives of major U.S. retailers including Target Home Depot, Kroger, CVS Health, Autozone and Best Buy urged Congress to take action to address the online sale of stolen, counterfeit and dangerous consumer products.\n* Newly released films from Universal Studios will stream exclusively on Peacock streaming service\n* Snap (SNAP) launched a new program on Tuesday named “523,” a new content accelerator program for smaller, minority-owned content companies. This new program will award 20 minority-owned media upstarts $10,000 per month for six months to help them create content.\n\n\"*Everything you've ever wanted is on the other side of fear.*\" -George Addair", "id": "rcre1z", "created_utc": 1639084312.0, "score": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "Fantastic.
