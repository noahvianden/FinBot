Several ARK funds actually invest in other ARK funds to help fluff their numbers. Several invest in nearly identical positions. Almost all of them invest in Tesla for some reason, usually to an absurd allocation.\n\nAnd she happened to have a lucky year last year.

The real money in in the pipeline and tolls](https://preview.redd.it/l373nr0ux8381.jpg?width=886&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77eb9ec104f8bc0ffcf6f70f7c89dc6029ec35e5)\n\nEnbridge is one of the largest midsteam players with key pipelines that are over subscribed. Basically since no one is allowing anyone to build pipes, they have a lock on volumes for next while. Their transportation/pipelines make money regardless of commodity prices and their risks are political in nature.\n\nLine 5: [https://www.nationalobserver.com/2021/12/01/news/michigan-line-5-court-case-enbridge](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2021/12/01/news/michigan-line-5-court-case-enbridge)\n\nLine 5 is heavily disputed and there are alot of news/political risks associated with Line 5. However everyone still strongly believes that there will be no near term decision, that the pipe isn't turn off overnight.\n\nCatalyst: Dec 7 is their investor day where they provide their 2022 guidance, address how much they will grow their 2022 dividend (currently at 7% yield) and address questions on Line5 and probably mainline.\n\nI am holding my position based on the Dec 7th catalyst and next earnings because:\n\n1. No one can build a pipeline. it's political suicide. But ppl still need to transport and pipelines are safer then by truck or rail. So Enbridge is in a key position to maintain high usage of their assets\n2. Dec 7 should be a good forward looking catalyst. I expect that they will announce new projects and that they are doing a sharebuyback and looking for accretive acquisition targets. There are many articles that speak to their cash flow and their big opportunity for next year\n3. Many shareholders are institutions and large funds. This is a defensive stock in a time of risk and i'm prefectly happy to hold my position and live off a growing 7% yield. I do believe that more shareholders will grow their ENB position as fears about oil&gas taking a covid hit go away\n\nMy position below: Parking my earnings in $ENB and going to ride out the kangroo stock market for the next few months.\n\n[Current position](https://preview.redd.it/titw7u4619381.jpg?width=965&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c21e9f2097c3b431c2ce956d7403ac723113cc6)", "id": "r7pjha", "created_utc": 1638503072.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "Good work op.
