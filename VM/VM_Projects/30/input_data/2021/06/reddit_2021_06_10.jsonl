{"title": "Buy $BB Recommendations by David Gardner (Stock Advisor - A Motley Fool Service) July 19, 2018!!! That's still a sweet opportunity.", "selftext": "Hey Ya! Remember the early 2000s? It was all about lace-up jeans, giant cargo shorts, Gilmore Girls, Lord of the Rings, the Atkins Diet ... and the BlackBerry.\n\nLong before the iPhone, the BlackBerry was the most beloved mobile gadget in the universe, known especially for its reliability, its security, and its full keyboard. But Research In Motion, the company that made it, didn't change quickly enough with the times, and the sweet fruit of its labors went sour. The company renamed itself BlackBerry (NYSE: BB) in early 2013 and set on a course of reinvention — first around smartphones, and then around software. Many people wrote it off.\n\nAnd that's where we see a major opportunity.\n\nBlackBerry has been quietly accelerating in its new mission securing all the connected devices that the modern world increasingly relies on. You've heard of the Internet of Things, chips embedded in all the stuff around us transmitting a wealth of data? Call the business angle \"the Enterprise of Things.\" BlackBerry's new focus still draws on its expertise in endpoint security, which shows us the fruit hasn't fallen so far from the tree. But this time around, it's securing things like self-driving vehicles, emergency health networks, financial reporting, and much more.\n\nIf your image of BlackBerry is stuck in the past, read on. This is a company with a future.\n\nSecond Bloom!\n\nIt's no surprise that most investors would pass BlackBerry by after a quick glance. Revenue has declined every year since 2011 — and even then, the company's share price was far below the peak of nearly $150 that it reached in mid-2008.\n\nBut this is, quite simply, an entirely different company than the BlackBerry most people remember, and its turnaround is just starting to take hold. Moreover, the company's progress is masked by the continuing decline of old legacy businesses that aren't part of management's vision or our investment thesis going forward.\n\nBlackBerry continued to sell its own handheld devices until mid-2016, and there are still BlackBerry-branded devices available, so current results continue to suffer from the decline of this business. Service access fees (SAF), related to legacy users of BlackBerry operating systems, are also dwindling. Given that these two businesses still represented roughly 50% of revenue in fiscal 2017, their continued decline has been keenly felt.\n\nBut the meat of the current business, Software and Services, has grown at an average annual pace of 15% over the past three years, reaching $782 million in fiscal 2018 (the company's fiscal year ends in February). This is now by far the largest part of BlackBerry, and we expect revenue for the company as a whole to stabilize this year and start rising thereafter.\n\nThe company's QNX operating system, in particular, has been driving growth. Traditionally used in vehicle infotainment systems, it has grown into the software backbone that can run all the chips in a vehicle, including safety and communications. BlackBerry has struck key deals with Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU), and others around this technology. Baidu, in turn, has made QNX the core of its Apollo platform, and has partnered with automakers like Ford (NYSE: F) and Hyundai to make this the core of future autonomous vehicles.\n\nThis certainly isn't the only area where BlackBerry's business is growing, but it's emblematic of the niche the company is carving out: securing endpoints in the Internet of Things, with a particular focus on enterprises. It has been a leader in Gartner's (NYSE: IT) Magic Quadrant for enterprise mobility management for the past two years, making it one of the Top Dogs in a sector that's expected to grow revenue at a 25% annual pace through 2021. \n\nStill Green!\n\nThat hasn't yet put BlackBerry in the black, but it's building the core of a very profitable business.\n\nSince being recapitalized by Fairfax Financial in 2013, BlackBerry has boasted a strong balance sheet, with $2.2 billion in cash and $810 million in convertible debt (which will likely convert to shares rather than being repaid). Gross margin improved from 49% in fiscal 2017 to an amazing 73% in fiscal 2018, indicating not only the company's shift from hardware to software, but also some considerable pricing power. Management also expects the company to deliver positive free cash flow this year (it did last year, too, albeit thanks to a large one-time adjustment).\n\nAdd it up and this is a $5.4 billion company currently generating around $800 million in very high-margin software revenue (leaving aside the remaining hardware and SAF businesses), with over 80% of that revenue recurring. With a gross margin that improved to 76% in the most recent quarter, we expect this business to ultimately produce profit margins in the 20% to 25% range, even as the top line continues to grow. That looks like an attractive price point.\n\nRisks and When We'd Sell!\n\nThere are a lot of reasons to look more deeply at BlackBerry's financials, but the surface picture remains unflattering. For the time being, this remains a company with shrinking revenue and marginal profitability. Changing that relies not just on continued growth of the software business, but scaling the business so that BlackBerry's relatively high sales, marketing, and R&D costs come down as a percentage of revenue.\n\nThe company is a leader in a growing sector, but its competitors — companies like IBM (NYSE: IBM), VMware (NYSE: VMW), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO), and others — have a lot of resources. That's why it's important that BlackBerry establish an especially strong presence in areas like vehicles, but we would like to see it keep getting wins in other areas, too.\n\nThe Foolish Bottom Line!\n\nNot every turnaround works, but BlackBerry has already become a leader in enterprise mobility management by leveraging its security DNA. This company has spent the last five years under CEO John Chen honing its new focus, and at this point he says the company is \"largely done reinventing itself\" and ready to focus on furthering its leadership. Chen should know — he's a turnaround expert who was previously brought into database company Sybase, returning it to profitability before it was sold to SAP (NYSE: SAP) in 2010.\n\nWhether or not BlackBerry remains on its own or is ultimately acquired, we expect it to continue expanding its capability and reach in keeping connected \"things\" safe and secure. The best part is that many investors can't see the green shoots growing from the rotten fruit of a decade past.

{"title": "$SPCE - A Deep Dive Due Diligence - Virgin Galactic Has Serious Potential", "selftext": "You are already aware of a promising, hyper-growth stock that goes by $SPCE – Virgin Galactic. The purpose of this analysis is to inform you about all of the ins and outs of Virgin Galactic, so that you can be confident and informed, think of it as doing your own Due Diligence. \n\n**Company Overview:**\n\nHere is a Statement from [SPCE’s 10-K filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001706946-21-000056/) that explains their mission and business, “We are a vertically-integrated aerospace company pioneering human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers, as well as a manufacturer of advanced air and space vehicles. Using our proprietary and reusable technologies and supported by a distinctive, Virgin-branded customer experience, we are developing a spaceflight system designed to offer customers, whom we refer to as \"future astronauts,\" a unique, multi-day, transformative experience. This culminates in a spaceflight that includes views of Earth from space and several minutes of weightlessness that will launch from Spaceport America, New Mexico. We believe that one of the most exciting and significant opportunities of our time lies in the commercial exploration of space and the development of technology that will change the way we travel across the globe in the future. Together we are opening access to space to change the world for good.”\n\nVirgin Galactic is an Aerospace company that is among the first to enter into the commercial space flight industry. Virgin Galactic believes in the massive potential of space exploitation and monetization of commercial space flight and is positioning themselves to be a leader in the space (pun intended). The market for commercial space flight is a new concept that is yet to be explored, however there are a few other companies that are trying to break into this industry as well (i.e. [$LMT - Lockheed Martin](https://utradea.com/stocks/LMT)).\n\nIn the history of mankind, there have only been 581 humans to ever explore space. However, all of these people have been handpicked by [governmental space agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_space_agencies) and have been trained for many years. Virgin Galactic is trying to change this and make space flight available to high net-worth individuals (at the moment) so that these seemingly regular people have the chance to do something extraordinary and explore what space has to offer.\n\nThus far, Virgin Galactic has $80M in deposits from over 600 people, who are interested in using Virgin Galactic as a vehicle to explore space. Virgin Galactic is expecting to receive their last FAA approval needed to fly their customers in their aircrafts.\n\n**Investment Information:**\n\n*Commercial Space Flight Industry:*\n\nOver the past decade, space flight has been innovated consistently, through rapidly advancing technologies, decreasing costs, and greater access to capital for private space flight companies/organizations. Many governments have taken a hands-off approach to space flight and funded private companies who compete for contracts and are forced to be constantly innovating in order to win these contracts. This competition has resulted in technologies that greatly reduce the waste, emissions, and cost of space travel.\n\nVirgin Galactic has been able to incorporate the best innovations in space flight into their aircrafts to create a reusable rocket that increases launch consistency, number of launches, and decreases the cost of space exploration.\n\nLastly, Virgin Galactic is exploring certain strategic relationships in order to advance their technologies, identify new applications, accelerate their progress, and enhance their growth as a company.\n\n***Financial Information:***\n\n* **Financial Performance (Good):** Virgin Galactic increased their R&D expenses by 19% YoY, although this is considered a cost, it is necessary for their business to spend on R&D, and I believe the improvements in technology derived from R&D spending will be considered an asset in the future.\n* **Financial Performance (Bad):** In 2020, Virgin Galactic’s revenues decreased by 93.7%, their gross profit decreased by 96.34%, their net loss increased by 199.79%, and their net margin decreased from 47% to 27%. This is due to the fact that the US government decreased their engineering service budget, having adverse effects on Virgin Galactic’s business.\n* **Liquidity Position:** Virgin Galactic currently has a cash position of $665.9M (and an additional $13M of restricted cash). Having this many cash should help Virgin Galactic to weather the storm in the meantime until the eventually are able to have a positive net income.\n* **Stock-Based Compensation:** Virgin Galactic’s board of directors, along with the shareholders adopted the 2019 Incentive Award Plan, which reserved 21.21M common shares to be awarded to employees, consultants, and directors. If these shares were to be distributed evenly over the next 3 years, there would be dilutionary effects of 2.85%/year.\n* **Director Compensation Table:** Virgin Galactic awards members on their board with stock awards, in 2020, Virgin Galactic gave out awards of $124,994 to 4 board members, totalling $500k of stock compensation. In Virgin Galactic’s 10-K report they stated that this compensation resulted in a total of 99,465 shares distributed to these members. This would cause share dilution of around 0.04% which is essentially negligible.\n* **Anniversary Awards:** Virgin galactic also gave out some “anniversary awards” to some of their highest-ranking employees, to recognize their ongoing service. In 2020, they gave out 931,93 common shares to 4 of their longest-standing, high-ranking employees, this would cause share dilution of 0.4%, although this dilution is not a large figure it still adds up over time.\n* **Colglazier Awards:** In 2020, Virgin Galactic awarded their CEO – Michael Colglazier with a maximum of 1,070,000 in monthly installments over 60 months. This represents 214,000 shares being distributed to him every year, which would have a dilutionary effect of 0.09%/year.\n* **Palermo Awards:** Furthermore, in 2020, Virgin Galactic also awarded their COO, Enrico Palermo with a maximum of 200,828 shares, however upon retirement he only decided to take 25% (50,207 shares), which would cause a dilution of existing shares of 0.02%.\n* **Exercisable Options:** Currently, there are 717,603 underlying shares in options that are exercisable. If all of these options are exercised there will be dilutionary effects of around 0.3%, although this is not much it adds up.\n\n***Virgin Galactic’s Strategy:***\n\nVirgin Galactic plans to use their proprietary and reusable flight system to seek to provide affordable, safe, reliable, and regular transportation to space for their customers. Virgin Galactic has highlighted a few ways in which they intend to achieve this:\n\n* **Commercial program for Human Spaceflight:** Virgin Galactic is in their final stages of readying their commercial spaceflight program and has been vigorously testing their [VSS Unity Spaceship](https://www.virgingalactic.com/mission/). Currently, they are happy with the performance and are completing the final touches, like adding a cabin interior, before they prepare their first future astronauts for space.\n* **Expanding their Fleet of Rockets:** Virgin Galactic plans to build more of their VSS Unity Rockets to expand their fleet of vehicles. Furthermore, they are working on building two SpaceShip III vehicles. By creating these vehicles, Virgin Galactic is hoping to increase their annual flight rate, which will help them to maximize their revenues.\n* **Lowering Costs:** Virgin Galactic is constantly looking for ways to improve their manufacturing and operating efficiency in order to decrease their total cost per spaceship. Furthermore, as they continue to manufacture additional spaceships and improve their technology, they believe that their costs will decrease smoothly over time.\n* **Leverage their Proprietary Technology:** Virgin Galactic intends to continue to expand on their proprietary technologies to pursue growth opportunities and enter into agreements with other government organizations for the use of their ships.\n\n***Management Team:***\n\nIt is very important to look at the credentials of the [management team](https://www.virgingalactic.com/who-we-are/our-team/), especially when looking at high growth stocks that have mainstream hype. Furthermore, this is increasingly important when looking at SPACs, or companies who previously were listed publicly via SPAC (like Virgin Galactic). By looking at the management team you get an idea of their experience and expertise in the field, which helps to validate the company and decrease the chances of a scam. (A great example of a SPAC with an awful management team is [$NKLA - Nikola](https://utradea.com/stocks/NKLA) and look at what happened to them).\n\n* Virgin Galactic’s CEO was formerly the Chief of Staff at NASA and was the Space Shuttle Launch Integration Manager at NASA as well.\n* Virgin Galactic’s President of Aerospace Systems has 20 years of experience in aerospace, defense, and cyber security industries.\n* Virgin Galactic’s VP of Engineering had 40 years of experience working under Lockheed Martin.\n* Virgin Galactic’s team of pilots has 269 years of combined flight experience with organizations like NASA, RCAF, RAF, US Air Force, and the US Marine Corps.\n* Furthermore, there are many distinguished members on Virgin Galactics Space Advisory board including former NASA Chief of Staff George Whitesides, and former astronauts Sandy Magnus and Chris Hadfield.\n\nI think that this management team is well-rounded, and very experienced. This is very good to see in a business as technical as Virgin Galactic’s and it shows me the legitimacy of their business and their future potential. Furthermore, there is no doubt in my mind that this is a legitimate company who is making serious efforts to change space travel for all of mankind.\n\n***Competitors:***\n\nVirgin Galactic has competition both in the private space, and in the public markets. Virgin Galactic’s private competition provides more of a threat to their operations/business, so I decided to include them. However, Virgin Galactic’s public competitors are not as big of a threat, but I have to include them in this section because of the comparable analysis that is later to come.\n\nVirgin Galactic’s private competitors include Space X, and Blue Origin, both of these companies (namely Space X) have made tremendous strides in the space travel industry and have made several advancements that have made space travel easier to access.\n\nVirgin Galactic’s public competitors, are companies that operate similarly to Virgin Galactic, have similar goals for their business, and are listed on the public markets. These companies include [The Boeing Company ($BA),](https://utradea.com/stocks/BA) [Lockheed Martin Corp. ($LMT),](https://utradea.com/stocks/LMT) [Aerojet RocketDyne Holdings Inc. ($AJRD),](https://utradea.com/stocks/AJRD) and [Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. ($SPR).](https://utradea.com/stocks/SPR) These companies will be seen again in the comparable analysis, where I will compare the financial ratios and multiples of Virgin Galactic to that of these competitors.\n\n**Investment Valuation:**\n\nThe only way in which I could value Virgin Galactic is via comparable analyses. Furthermore, since there were only 3 multiple and/or ratios that exhibited a positive number, I had to choose to compare those ratios/multiples. The ratios/multiples that I chose were [P/B](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/price-to-book-ratio/), [PEG,](https://www.thebalance.com/fundamental-analysis-understanding-the-peg-ratio-3140796) and [EV/Assets.](https://www.wallstreetmojo.com/ev-to-assets/)\n\n*P/B:*\n\nBy comparing Virgin Galactic’s P/B ratio against their public competitors (listed above in the “competitors” section of this report) I arrived at a fair value per share of $SPCE of $25.73, which implies a downside risk of 29.24%.\n\n*EV/Assets:*\n\nBy comparing Virgin Galactic’s EV/Assets multiple to that of their public competitors, I arrived at an implied downside of 69.17%, or a share price of $11.21.\n\n*PEG:*\n\nThe last ratio that I examined was the PEG, which implied an upside of 14.99% to a share price of $41.81.\n\nAverage Comparable:\n\nIn order to arrive at an unbiased valuation, I decided to take the average of the 3 results that I arrived at through my comparable analyses. By doing this, I got an all-encompassing fair value of $26.25/share, which would imply a downside risk of 27.80%.\n\nI do not think that this is the be all and end all for valuing $SPCE, because in this analysis I compared their ratios/multiples to other companies that were already more mature and were not solely focused on commercial space flight. An example of this is Boeing. Boeing has plans for space travel, however their business is generated through the sale of airplanes, this is vastly different from Virgin Galactic so the comparable does not make the most sense. So, although Virgin Galactic is not an undervalued stock today, they may be in the future when they make their own revenues.\n\nHowever, I do think that this valuation implies that current and potential investors should be aware of the risk and potential downside of this investment, however wherever there is risk, there is reward, and the reward for this investment could be astronomical (once again pun intended).\n\n**Risks:**\n\n* **Share Dilution:** Virgin Galactic has a lot of programs, and awards that incentivize their employees, and directors through stock compensation. These programs/awards include stock-based compensation, director compensation table, anniversary awards, Colglazier awards, Palermo awards, and exercisable option awards. By grouping all of this dilution into one figure, we arrive at a maximum dilution for the year 2020 to be 3.68%. This is a large number and should be considered by new and existing shareholders alike. However, this is a high growth potential investment, so it is not uncommon to have higher figures of dilution.\n* **Financial Performance:** Virgin Galactic’s financial performance in 2020 was very poor, however it was due to the loss of contractual revenue from the US government. In the grand scheme of things, Virgin Galactic will not be relying on the US Government for the majority of their revenues, so it should not scare away investors from the bigger picture revenues for Virgin Galactic.\n\n**Catalysts:**\n\n* **FAA Approval:** If Virgin Galactic can get their last 2 approvals from the FAA, they can start to take their commercial space flight business seriously and start to generate their own revenues. Once they start generating their own revenues, they should be able to turn a profit and work towards overall profitability of the business.\n* **Successful Flights:** If Virgin Galactic can continue to have successful trials and flights, their reputation as a commercial space travel business will be solidified. This is especially important during the early stages of their business because trust is everything.\n\n**TLDR**\n\nGreat financials, strong leadership, and milestone accomplishments. SPCE is poised for continued growth if they can continued down this path.\n\n**Credit to** [**u/Lost-Guarantee229**](https://www.reddit.com/u/Lost-Guarantee229/) **The Original Post (with pictures and graphs) can be found** [**here**](https://utradea.com/positions/60c212d524731e30f5a930a6)", "id": "nwoate", "created_utc": 1623333473.0, "score": 167, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 39, "comments": [{"body": "I started buying SPCE in December 2019, have been holding/randomly buying since then.

{"title": "AMD will Rocket after the Xilinx acquisition is approved, which could be as soon as July 6th", "selftext": "UK and EU approval likely on July 6th!\n\n[Su Bae](https://i.redd.it/dvg5sf39rg471.gif)\n\nAMD stock is being held down by Arbitrage trading due to the all-stock fixed-ratio Xilinx acquisition. Once that acquisition is approved by world regulators, arbitrage will stop and the stock will soar. Note that the acquisition doesn't have to close, it just needs to be approved for the Arbitrage to stop. Once Arbitrage stops, all of the short selling which is holding AMD stock down will stop, and AMD will rocket towards it's price targets between $106-135\n\n**Arbitrage effect on stocks**In an all-stock fixed ratio merger, the hedge fund playbook is to short sell the acquiring stock, AMD, and buy the stock being acquired, XLNX. For example, they will short 1M AMD stock and buy 580k XLNX stock. They will then hold these positions until the acquisition closes, where the 580k XLNX turns into 1M AMD and then they cover their short position, pocketing the price difference. The short selling pushes the price of AMD down, continually, until the arbitrage stops.\n\nRead more on AMD Merger Arbitrage here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd\\_an\\_explanation\\_on\\_merger\\_arbitrage\\_and\\_how\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n4r47g/amd_an_explanation_on_merger_arbitrage_and_how_to/)\n\nArbitrage will end when the share ratio between XLNX stock and AMD stock is equal, where there's no difference to be gained. Right now the share ratio difference is \\~1.57 or about 10%. The 10% difference is there for the chance that the acquisition does not go through. Once world regulators approve it though, the chance of acquisition is basically 100% and the share ratio difference will be 0. With no difference, the arbitrage trading and short selling stops and the stock rises. In the case of AMD, the average price target is some 30% over today's prices, so it should rocket.\n\n[https:\\/\\/public.tableau.com\\/app\\/profile\\/upndown\\/viz\\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio\\_16114624177710\\/XilinxAMDSharePriceRatio](https://preview.redd.it/gr9sro1mqg471.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=2fc21af702904945f5aa76ae8d7d85c1be4c3a84)\n\n**Possibility of Arbitrage ending soon**CEO Dr. Lisa Su has said many times that the acquisition will close by the end of the year. She's also always conservative in her estimates. Remember that she said revenue would increase by 37% in 2021, only to revise it in Q2 to 50% growth. Su, you sly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/ligcuvdksg471.gif\n\nYou can track the regulatory approval status over here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD\\_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory\\_approval\\_status/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/n9xnu2/regulatory_approval_status/)\n\nThe US has already approved and Phase 1 of the approval process for the UK and EU will end on July 6th. If there are no objections, the acquisition is approved from them as well. There are not expected to be any objections. If there were any, they would go into Phase 2, which would end at the end of the year (Lisa's conservative timeline).\n\nThe big question is when will China approve? They're the last ones to give the approval. Well no one really knows when this is going to happen. In Oct. of 2020 AMD said they would be drafting a notification to SAMR (China). But that's really the last we heard of it.\n\nThere's a possibility that China will approve around the same time as the UK and EU, which could be as soon as July 6th. In that case,\n\n[butts](https://preview.redd.it/wsr44v9qlg471.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=92b9ec2b60f88b9b5443895e00486e98edfa63ef)\n\nAMD announced on May 19th that it was initiating a $4B stock buyback. And since then it appears that AMD has been buying back it's own stock in big chunks every day around 9:30-10am:\n\n[perdy](https://preview.redd.it/1cmdiz4fng471.png?width=538&format=png&auto=webp&s=b1e1174f74f52798ea863caab6172b972d0698b6)\n\nThe doctor is smart. She knows the arb is keeping the stock down and aims to profit from it. The timing of the buyback may suggest that she thinks the approval is going to happen sooner than the end of the year.\n\nEither way, the stock will rocket once the approval happens. Could be in less than a month, if not, then it'll be end of year. Either way we're making tendies, it's just a matter of how soon. Place your bets!
