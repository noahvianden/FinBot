{"title": "$LEVI - The King of Denim üëñ", "selftext": "EDIT: Updated DD\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oa2i3q/hot_girl_summer_the_upcoming_clothing_boom_why/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\nAfter the recent inflation FUD, many retail stocks got hit hard and blue chip has been slow to recover. Enter LEVI the most recognizable and best sold denim brand in the world who got extremely oversold after reaching new highs and posting earnings that beat expectations.\n\nWho is LEVI and why are they relevant now? I should slap you with my brand new pair of 541 jeans I just ordered if you really have to ask. They are the leading fashion company for everything denim. LEVI has been around for over 168 years as a profitable business, but only recently IPO‚Äôd in 2019. Since then LEVI shares up 53%. Throughout the pandemic they have kicked ass in building up their e-commerce platform and have worked on making their business more sustainable with their line of water-less jeans.\n\n\nCEO Chip Bergh is a smart cookie üç™ (see what I did there), he managed to help LEVI‚Äôs grow 436% last year by diversifying beyond denim and selling more directly to consumer. Projected growth is 23% for next year as a conservative value, but Chip believes they are strongly positioned to come out even higher this year as the pandemic comes to an end with more people going back out to shop and spend their money on new wardrobes.\n\nAfter being oversold last week, LEVI has been on a slow and steady recovery. OTM options took a big hit and are currently on freaking sale. Most price targets for end of year are around $30-32 with a high of $36 and even the most bearish analyst has $25 as their projection. That leads to me the most important section.\n\nPositions:\nCurrently, holding 86 x $30c 10/15 which at time of posting is almost worth $1.00. Super fucking cheap and easy to ride for either a quick pop or all the way to expiration. Earnings are coming up on 7/6, which has already likely been priced in, but is actually still very undervalued. Delta on the call option is great, Theta is super low, Gamma is decent, and Vega could blow up the premium because IV is only 38%.

{"title": "$AMD - The Return of Su Bae - 10 Month Old Technical Setup Looking to Breakout", "selftext": "I'm a fan of this stock like many others here I'm sure - so I try to keep a close eye on the chart. There has been a very large falling wedge setup building for 10 months now. With Nasdaq going crazy - we might just nail a breakout this week.\n\n[$AMD 1W 2Y](https://preview.redd.it/osqk5jp6h1771.png?width=2229&format=png&auto=webp&s=f15d503aa5d3e4e7a863197cea2920546476ba84)\n\nHere is the setup in question. You can see its a falling wedge that began on the week of **7/27**. We attempted to break last week and closed **just** on the line - with some increased volume. After a back test yesterday - it looks like we are trying to nail the close this time around.\n\nIn order for that to happen - we need **4 PM on Friday to be above** **84.00.**\n\nThis would trigger a breakout targeting **90** resistance first, followed by **100** and **110.**\n\nMaybe we could overshoot to **125** \\- but I'm going to be selling all/most around that last target.\n\nThis breakout is invalid if we don't get the close - but the pattern will still be alive. It has some room for another trip down - so long as we hold **72.50.**\n\nOverall a pretty textbook chart setup - don't overthink it. I'm looking @ **August 90c** for this one, I might roll them back when we get ITM.\n\nPost breakout - I'll be putting a stop loss at **83.00.**\n\nThe move should play out over **2-3** months.", "id": "o6g0r5", "created_utc": 1624464756.0, "score": 130, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|22|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|196|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I‚Äôve been in AMD for awhile now and it‚Äôs been one of my favorite stocks.", "score": 14, "replies": []}, {"body": "I love this stock!", "score": 22, "replies": []}, {"body": "AMD is kicking ass!
