{"title": "$XPEV DD - A True EV/AV Company", "selftext": "In the EV Market, there are an increasing number of players vying for market share, so how is one to know which is the company to own if they wanted to consider investing?\n \nThe answer is simply....research. And today, I'd like to share some of my own thoughts based on the research I have done to date.\n \n1. Tesla has arguably been the King in the EV Space for some time now and minted some individuals a tidy profit if they stuck with the company through thick and thin. Being first in this space from a mass production standpoint, has worked well for them. However the crown is starting to tarnish. \nThere are quality concerns, and recently the Model 3 lost Consumer Reports Top Pick Status and IIHS Safety Award after stripping features. Safety concerns with the Model 3 is a big PR problem especially in the world's largest market...China. \n\nChina is also worried about government employees owning Teslas due to perceived security concerns with surveillance. \n\nOne also must acknowledge that Tesla makes its money, not from selling cars, but from the \"regulatory credits\" it gets from governments around the world in their push to reduce carbon emissions. Since Tesla only sells electric vehicles, they get these credits for free and can sell them at a huge profit to other auto manufacturers who can't meet environmental targets. It's big $ for Tesla, but what one cannot look away from is the fact that Tesla IS NOT profitable from selling its cars. At least, not yet.\n\n2. Now on to Chinese Car manufacturers...and there are quite a few. The big names are Buffet-loved and held, BYD. Li Auto which is relatively new, NIO which has some similar roots to Xpeng Motors, but isn't the same. All mentioned here are true EV plays.\n\nXpeng/Tesla, and the race to autonomous driving. \n\n3. Autonomous Vehicles is truly the next play in this market and a necessary move for vehicles to go in. Removing driver error is huge for safety and will save insurance companies a TON of money. And in the AV space, the race is between Tesla and Xpeng.\n\n4. Not long ago, Musk charged Xpeng for stealing proprietary tech after a senior engineer left Tesla to join the Xpeng Team. Same was said about a senior Apple engineer who left Apple's Car R&D division and joined Xpeng as well. Tesla sued the engineer and the linchpin was on the AV tech housed in Xpeng's XPILOT software. Tesla argued that their tech was in their software. \nIn the end, both companies agreed to allow an independent tech arbitrator to view both company's AV source code, and guess what....it was proven that both Tesla and Xpeng have their own source codes that were designed by their own R&D efforts, and nothing was stolen or was being shared. That was BIG News!!\n\n5. Xpeng in the quest toward Phase 5 self driving cars, liked the safety and accuracy that LiDar tech provides. Musk, on the other hand, scoffed at LiDar for years calling it a 'fool's' play. However, years later, Musk is now conceding there is something to LiDar and may even be developing with it.\n\nBut here is the rub, Xpeng has it, is using it, and their software works very very well with all the various sensors combined. Their new model, the P5, was showcased at the Shanghai Auto Show, complete with LiDar, and that show gave Xpeng 10,000 pre orders on reveal day alone. I can only imagine how that number has grown since, and in October, deliveries begin.\n\n6. Xpeng has a new manufacturing facility set to go online in December of this year which will ramp up the ability to produce more cars. In 2022, they also have plans for 2-3 new models, one of which will be a new SUV type.\n\n7. In the race toward full autonomous vehicle capabilities, Xpeng is targeting 2025 as the year for this to be fully operational, safe and complete. That said, they are logging thousands upon thousands of accident free XPILOT driver assisting kilometers with their cars doing a lot of the driving without needing help from the driver. No sleeping behind the wheel yet, but they are charting a significant course towards getting this done!\n\nTesla? Well...when was the last time you heard of an accident or life lost? Probably not long ago, so they still have  a long ways to go I think, and now Musk is backpeddling on his timelines for full AV capabilities. \n\nSCALE \n\n8. Like China or not, with the GREEN push throughout the world and everything drivable going electric, there really is only ONE country that can help to meet the demand...China. They are a manufacturing powerhouse, and Xpeng is ramping up to get the world and humanity, the cars they need.\n\nSOFTWARE AS A SERVICE\n\n9. A big hope for Tesla is that they can sell the software for their cars to have the capabilities they “can\" have. You want software assisted driving? That’s going to cost you like 4 grand as an option. It’s smart, if it works well.\nXpeng has a similar hope, but is really successful already in this strategy. They also deploy OTA upgrades on what seems to be a weekly basis almost, which is exciting like when your phone gets an Over-the-Air update and new features, that same excitement is happening with XPeng’s car owners, and it is translating into more sales. \n\nAnd while we are on the topic of sales, you can’t help but notice that Xpeng was the first Chinese EV Car company to start selling vehicles in Europe in Norway, and plan to expand their distribution in more parts of Europe before the year is over. \n\nIn Conclusion...\n \nXpeng is an impressive company with huge goals for itself and they make technologically superior vehicles from many different angles. Entertainment, Drivability, Safety, Comfort, etc.\n \nI remember reading a quote of a comment that He Xiaopeng (Xpeng CEO and Founder) said to Musk, and it went something like this...\"We will destroy you in China, and we will be an absolute nuisance to you in Europe,\" and I think it won't be long, if not already, that He Xiaopeng lives up to his statement. \n \nXpeng is worth a serious look and currently has price targets north of $50 USD. A great opportunity for a company of purchasing value today. Do your own research and I think you will come to see the true Tesla competitor, if not successor!\n\n[Xpeng Motors - The One to Watch] (https://en.xiaopeng.com/)", "id": "o1lrzx", "created_utc": 1623895706.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "Why not buy both I have Xpeng and Nio shares both doing well.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Xpeng, Nio, and Li.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Have to agree with the OP that Xiapeng is a good/true EV play.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "[Up](https://www.markovchained.com/assets/view/XPEV?position_id=4017) 11% since OP's first post, seems pretty legit.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It's also important to note that with China's low inflation rates projected through to 2026, Xpeng stands to do well in the world's largest economy that also happens to be their target market as well.

{"title": "RNG production, a high margin activity thanks to public incentives, $CLNE focus", "selftext": "Good morning everyone,\n\nthis DD will be focused more on the RNG production business. First some history on $CLNE and then the reason why **Total**, **BP**, **Chevron**, and **Enbridge** (among the largest groups) are looking at this magic fuel.\n\nPlease have a look at my other posts before reading this one:\n\n* [Biomethane / RNG general business case](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nsbfm1/biomethane_renewable_natural_gas_why_it_deserves/)\n* [Biomethane / RNG potential if compared with Hydrogen & BEVs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nthp3b/dd_rng_potential_if_compared_with_hydrogen_bevs/)\n* [Biomethane / RNG legislative focus in the infrastructure plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nvgvpc/clean_energy_for_america_act_to_favor_net_zero/)\n* [Biomethane / RNG to achieve clean air in California](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0zwrj/california_natural_gas_vehicles_partnership/)\n\n$CLNE used to produce in-house its RNG but was forced [to sell the facilities to BP back in 2017](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clean-enrgy-fuel-m-a-bp-biomethane-idUSKBN1684C5), for $155 million. As part of the deal at the time, $CLNE signed a long-term contract to purchase biomethane from BP. The decision for $CLNE was due to a desperate need of cash, as at the time the company was still recovering after the massive oil price collapse, and the natural gas trucks business proposal relied mostly on the diesel-natural gas spread (which after the OPEC increase of supply became extremely unfavorable). Add into the equation the blistering Tesla narrative, and the disaster is complete.\n\nAfter the sale, $CLNE became a de-facto distributor, that is, a very low margin business mostly dependent on commodities price oscillation.\n\nDemand for natural gas kept rising over the quarters and in October 2018, $CLNE asked BP [to increase the RNG supply agreement](https://bioenergyinternational.com/biogas/bp-and-clean-energy-reach-agreement-to-increase-rng-supply). In February 2019, $CLNE set the goal [to offer zero carbon RNG at all of its fuelling stations by 2025](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-sustainability-goals-outline-road-to-100-renewable-zero-carbon-fuel-20-years-ahead-of-californias-electric-grid). Even if today RNG seems to be essential for the success of an energy company, at the time the market was not so happy for the announcement. RNG distribution margins are lower than the ones of fossil natural gas.\n\nThe company was likely aware of this and tried to increase margins with the zeronow program, which linked the price of fuel for leased trucks to the diesel price, minus an appealing fixed sum per gallon. The program took more than expected to take off and was not able to affect margins considerably.\n\nThis is part of the reason why after [the first UPS announcement in May 2019](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/release-archive/ups-makes-largest-purchase-of-renewable-natural-gas-ever-in-the-u-s) the share price was not able to hold its gains.\n\nIn 2019, markets and policymakers were not able to weigh properly the amazing characteristics of RNG. Hydrogen narrative was still in its infancy (after more than two decades of losses) and again the storytelling ability of Musk with the Tesla SEMI made everyone ignore RNG. The analyst of Raymond James (that kept a neutral rating on $CLNE for most of the share price from $2 to $20) used to mention BEV trucks and buses during earning calls, favoring these solutions and ignoring the environmental benefits of RNG.\n\n# How RNG is made, and why is it a magic fuel?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tjc8ejpq3s571.png?width=842&format=png&auto=webp&s=b547b16391903143cec0a6917db843e3def1ba9d\n\nRNG can be produced from landfills or wastewater facilities, or from farming operations waste (manure and some minor organic compounds). The first source is the reason why [Waste Management is so keen on RNG](https://mediaroom.wm.com/waste-management-unveils-30-million-renewable-natural-gas-rng-facility-in-louisville-kentucky/), and garbage trucks mostly run on RNG. The second one instead will be the main focus of $CLNE (and its partners)'s efforts, because it is the one with the lowest **CARBON INTENSITY** according to the California Air Resource Board.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[From $CLNE website](https://preview.redd.it/0mikl7uv4s571.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=0365000bad2d524e976859f6ae91ecfb1aa0d9a8)\n\nWithin an RNG facility, Gas emissions from farming operations do not leak into the atmosphere. Therefore, the 30x global warming effect of methane, if compared with CO2, is avoided. The very same methane burnt in a ICE will still show a positive global warming balance as the CO2 from the tailpipe emissions will have a 1/30x effect if compared with the collected natural gas.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# RNG production potential & margins\n\nFrom the $CLNE Q1-2021 earnings call, we know that there are from five to seven billion gallons of dairy RNG available annually and that according to management, it is going to take from 5 to 10 years to bring it online at the cost of **$50 billion to $70 billion**. From the same call, we know that in the USA 35 billion of diesel are consumed annually. Please note that $CLNE sells less than 100 million gallons per quarter, with 560 fueling stations in operations.\n\nOn the margin side, it is good to have a look at the question of Manav Gupta from Credit Suisse, during the same Q1-2021 earnings call:\n\n**Manav Gupta** (*Credit Suisse): I actually wanted to quickly focus on the upstream (RNG production) versus downstream (RNG distribution) profitability here. So let's say you have a company-owned station and let's say you believe it's giving you $0.30 to $0.35 a gallon. What I'm trying to understand is, is this Amazon deal giving you the volumes to develop the low CI RNG through your upstream partners and the profitability over there is 5$to $7 a gallon. So if you split that half way, that's like* ***$3 a gallon***\\*. So it doesn't really matter if on a downstream basis you make $0.30 a gallon or $0.40 a gallon, the real benefit of this deal is that now you can go back to your partners, Total, BP and others, develop the upstream RNG, which is like $3 a gallon. So the real benefit will come from the upstream side on the margin, not really the downstream side. Can talk about that?\\*\n\n**Robert M. Vreeland** *(CFO): Well, Manav, yes, and no. I mean, there's value on both, but you're absolutely correct that the demand that's created from a deal like this just completely supports our position on the upstream supply side. Because, look, I mean, after all, the upstream is being developed with the intent of putting it into -- to get the highest value to put it into vehicles, heavy duty vehicles. And so when you come to the table where you have that and you have that demand, then it's a pretty powerful upstream proposition. Not to mention the economics that then flow into the upstream, which is separate from that $0.30, $0.35 you mentioned. That would be, in our case, would be in the joint venture. Now we will have those economics to the extent that we are the producer and we're using the gas from ourselves. But we'll have to get it from other sources as we*ll.\n\n**Andrew J. Littlefair** *(CEO):  Manav, we also -- just on the source side, I don't want those on the call to think, well how are these guys going to develop all this RNG? We -- because we are the sort of the choke point with the infrastructure and have the largest network, we already take RNG for 40 different sources. And that grows all the time. And it will -- that will continue to grow. But Manav, you're right, the upstream is very profitable. But don't underestimate the value of the downstream per gallon. And don't -- and what I say, go back and look at my buildup, and you might be surprised that at a station that we own, our margin is better than what you're thinking.*\n\nIt seems then that management confirmed the educated guess of the analyst, which is around $3 of gross margins per gallon from the RNG production, against $0.40 from the RNG distribution. The reason why management underlined that also the distribution side of the business has potential, may be related to the fact that the current network operates at 50% capacity, thus average fixed costs will go down when the number of gallons will increase (source Q4 conference call transcript).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**RNG PRODUCTION & DISTRIBUTION PARTNERSHIPS OF $CLNE**\n\n**Truck adoption, leasing programs partnerships**\n\nOn the truck adoption at ports, $CLNE is favored by [the recent decision of the LA Long Beach authorities decision](https://www.porttechnology.org/news/port-of-long-beach-exempts-natural-gas-vehicles-from-clean-truck-fund-rate/), which will equate treatment of Natural Gas trucks with BEV ZERO-emissions ones. Please note that there are more than 16'000 trucks operating at this port, and as of Q2 900 trucks should be natural gas ones (6% market share). As a reminder, $CLNE annual revenue depends on around 48'000 Heavy-duty vehicles (bus and trucks).\n\nThe company is working with Chevron and recently upsized the program with an additional $20 million leasing support from the oil company (total program equal to **$28 million**). This is the timeline of the $CLNE & Chevron partnership:\n\n* July 2020, [Chevron Partners with Clean Energy](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chevron-partners-clean-energy-adopt-100000710.html) on Adopt-a-Port Initiative to Reduce Emissions\n* May 2021, [Chevron, Clean Energy Fuels extend Adopt-a-Port initiative](https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-clean-energy-fuels-extend-adopt-a-port-initiative-to-reduce-emissions) to reduce emissions\n\n$CLNE was active with Total too on the trucks' adoption side of the business ([the zeronow program mentioned earlier](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-launches-zero-now-financing-put-fleets-clean-new-natural-gas-trucks-price-diesel-truck)), with a **$100 million** fire capacity, launched in July 2018.\n\n**RNG production**\n\nAt the moment, on the RNG production side of the business, $CLNE has partnerships with the following companies:\n\n* $CLNE [& TOTAL JV](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-and-total-sign-joint-venture-to-develop-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure): announced in March 2021, is a 50/50 partnership with an initial commitment of **$100 million** and can increase to **$400 million** as development opportunities progress. In addition,  Total will be providing credit support for Clean Energy development in the RNG value chain, including $45 million for contracted RNG fueling infrastructure. Please note that the JV exposure can be larger than the funded amount due to leverage.\n* $CLNE [& BP JV](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-and-bp-create-jv-to-invest-in-rng-fuel-production): each company will retain 50% of the votes, but BP will fund **$50 million** and $CLNE will fund **$30 million.**\n\nPlease note that Chevron established partnerships on its own to set up RNG production facilities:\n\n* In September 2020, [CalBio, Dairy Farmers and Chevron announced their RNG JV](https://www.chevron.com/stories/calbio-dairy-farmers-and-chevron-announce-first-rng).\n* In December 2020, [Chevron and Brightmark](https://www.waste360.com/waste-energy/chevron-and-brightmark-forge-ahead-four-dairy-rng-projects) are partnering to build and own four projects in multiple states to produce RNG.\n* In February 2021, [Chevron and Brightmark](https://www.chevron.com/stories/chevron-brightmark-expand-partnership-on-dairy-biomethane-fuel-projects) expand the previously announced partnership.\n* In June 2021, Chevron announces to rebrand or [open more than 30 CNG retail sites](https://csnews.com/chevron-rebrand-or-open-more-30-cng-retail-sites-2025).\n\nIt seems clear that with $3 of gross margin per gallon the opportunity for $CLNE and its partners is huge. If just 25% of the distributed RNG is going to be produced in-house, it will represent a $300 million windfall for the company. This may help to understand why analysts' target prices are higher than today's price. **Although it is important to note that RNG plants require time to come online (from 9 to 15 months) therefore I think that we will see the first effect on the company's guidance later in 2022**.\n\n**Disclosure:** I am long $CLNE\n\n**Additional disclosure:** This content is intended to be used and must be used for informational purposes only.

You earned a doctorate in CLNE and RNG.\n\nSeveral stupid questions:\n\n1. Is it the goal of CLNE to lead the way in replacing diesel as the main source of fuel for the trucking industry? If so, what is the timeline for when this can be accomplished?\n2. You said that the US annual sales of diesel amounts to 35B (gallons right?) with RNG production being about 1/5th that, right? So CLNE sells about 0.4B gallons, or around 5% of total RNG produced? Do you have a list that shows the a ranking of the top sellers of RNG and their totals ($ and gallon amounts)? 5% seems a little low ... Is it that the producers are accumulating unsold RNG inventory because the infrastructure can't fully handle demand?\n3. What % of that 0.4B is \"produced\" by CLNE? I understand that CLNE is just getting back into the upstream side, but how far behind are they from its major competitors? Who are the biggest RNG producers and what is their total production capacity?\n4. Who are the major players for the downstream side? Is Chevron planning to just  replace their underground diesel tanks at all their service stations with LNG (instead of using pipelines like RNG)? Oh, what are the benefits/disadvantages of RNG over LNG? Do you think LNG would be a threat to CLNE, and if so, what do you think they have up their sleeve to ensure survival and success?\n5. That last question made me question whether RNG is the smarter solution than LNG (liquid natural gas) because an infrastructure for liquid fuel is already in place.

Trucking industry choices by 2030 will be diversified. It is wise for any tech not to target a 90% market share. This is impossible. It is more likely that we see various solutions all together. At the moment, CNG & LNG trucks have a 10% market share in China and 4% market share in Europe. In the USA the % stays at less than 2%, so the US will catch up dramatically. Which is the cap? I would say 15-20% market share, which will be more than enough to make CLNE infrastructure very profitable. In this regards, you can look at [Westport investors presentations](https://s26.q4cdn.com/361830528/files/doc_presentations/2021/06/MarketingMaterialsV1.pdf), where Volvo Trucks and Cummins forecasts are outlined (slide 12); both the companies see a 8-15% market share in the years to come. Or you can look at the [BNEF report](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/trucks-haul-zero-emissions-technology-into-commercial-vehicle-arena-59488098) , where they state that just one in five Heavy Trucks will be electric by 2040, with natural gas playing an important role.\n2. Not all the RNG will be used in transport, a part of it will be injected into pipelines, while another will be used as biogas (the not refined version) for power generation. Be careful those billions of RNG gallons represent a POTENTIAL supply, not the existing one today.\n3. At the moment $CLNE does not produce any RNG, they are setting up the JVs now. On the upstream side, British Petroleum is by far the largest producer thanks to the facilities bought from CLNE.\n4. Major competitors on the downstream side are private companies [https://www.loves.com/](https://www.loves.com/)  ; [https://americannaturalgas.com/](https://americannaturalgas.com/)  and other smaller ones. All these companies, included CLNE, mostly sell Compressed NAtural Gas. LNG is not yet popular in the USA as it is in Europe and China but there will some growth in coastal areas. RNG can be either CNG or LNG. CLNE sells a small portion of LNG in its stations\n5. Liquefied RNG in Europe is called BIO-LNG. There is not much difference between the two concepts.

{"title": "Oil update and current market", "selftext": "Hey guys. \n\nI posted last time about the oil environment and since then things have only gotten spicier. Here is the link to the last post. \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5dzl9/return_of_big_oil_the_death_of_oil_has_been/\n\nSorry to use a baseball reference but we are in the 2nd or 3rd inning of a great oil supercycle regardless of what the Kingdom of Saudi says through OPEC+. Last time I was speculating on the upside and I will continue to do so but update the current progress. I have sold some of my lower price calls ($60 and $70 and moved them to $80 calls) additionally, I have increased exposure to OXY calls.\n\nTLDR: Current Trends are now showing from Gov. agencies that we will not have enough increase to cover demand causing the price to continue to march upward. \nXOM Calls: 244 $80 calls for 1/21/22 63 $75 calls for 1/21/22 77 $70 calls for 1/21/22 6 $60 calls for 1/21/22\n\nOXY Calls: 31 $40 calls for 1/20/23\n\nOk. So here's some news. EIA reported their details yesterday and Baker Hughes put a great graph showing the number of rigs in correspondence with the oil price. One thing to note is that even with efficiencies in Rig use we will still need additional rigs to hold production flat as we see the large decline profiles on the well brought online in 2018-2019. Keep that in mind when looking at the US production. Might be time to look at Oilfield Service companies.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/chigrl/status/1405170946097483783\n\nThe expectation from WoW was for roughly a -4 million barrel draw and we doubled expectations with -7.5. One other thing  to note was that the refineries are running at extreme capacity in the US. They have yet to shut in for preventative maintenance that usually happens around this time. (92.7% utilization)\n\nhttps://www.eia.gov/petroleum/weekly/crude.php\n\nThis shows the current information on the week from the EIA on Crude Oil stocks. Clearly we are smack dab in the middle of the 5 year average however we should see draws consistently from this point on in the summer and even with significant activity we will expect that this summer oil will continue to rise. Macro wise, the Russian oil minister said that if more money is not reinvested in finding and developing oil (2020 $384 billion, normally its around $800-900 B) then the supercycle in oil will create a demand spike to prices of $150 per BBL. Take his commentary with a grain of salt. Its Russia.. That being said this new information prior to Q2 earnings from any O/G company has not been fully realized.\n\nFocusing on XOM, BOA announced that XOM will increase the dividend in Q4 and the share price should be around $90/share by the end of year while bringing the debt levels back to 20-25%. \n\nhttps://pulse2.com/xom-stock-price-increased-3-64-why-it-happened/\n\nThey are on the extreme end of pricing in terms of valuation but here is the consensus amongst analyst:\nGoldman:           $65\nMorgan Stanley: $71 edit MS just upped price target to $84\nCredit Suisse:    $72\nMorning Star:    $74\nJPM:                 $76\nBOA:                $90\n\nObviously, there are some that I am missing but you get the point at the current share price of $62.27 (sell off this morning) there is some upside in the near term. My key takeaway is that the analysts expect a large earnings report next quarter and the rest of the year. The Engine 1 board takeover (25% of the board) was able to convince the largest shareholders (Blackrock, Fidelity, California School Board) that the changing of the board would help govern the spending of XOM (not really focused on the climate side) however it would show that the large money managers are trying to make an attempt at moving towards climate issues. (IMO it was all about the recent performance of the stock and a referendum on Woods performance not on climate issues.)\n\nSo, where does that leave us?\n\nXOM in the next quarters at the current Oil price of $70.73 will be able to pay off a large portion of their debt from last year, pay the dividend and potentially raise the dividend by EOY. All while the price of oil remains above $70. Not to mention the activity in Guyana in which XOM found another zone to target offshore that will produce and sell at Brent pricing $72.83. (Might also be time to look at HESS)\n\nhttps://www.naturalgasintel.com/exxonmobil-partners-strike-more-oil-in-stabroek-offshore-guyana/\n\nAll of that is on the crude side w/o the refining capacity that XOM has increased and now lets talk about natural gas. The XTO acquisition was terrible by all means but it has provided some benefit of large natural gas exposure. Henry Hub currently is at $3.24 and essentially, XOM produces the gas and ships it to Asia where it sells for 2-3x HH. Currently, the outlook is good and should remain stable with more gas going to exports until we see a larger increase in export capacity and there is a chance that with a colder winter this year, 2022 would have large swings in gas pricing. Roughly we are 4% down on the 5 year average curve but gas companies have been extremely hesitant to increase production and have contained supply.\n\nNow on to OXY. What a terrible company. Literally every time I look at the balance sheet I cry. So bad. However, they have a couple good signs that they will make it out ok. \n#1 Burry decided to pick up 225,000 shares\n#2 CNBC reported live that David Tepper thinks oxy will end the year at $40-50/share\n#3 As quoted in their IR slides, for every $1 increase from $45 in WTI Oxy will have 185MM (46.25MM per QTR) so lets play on this further and we would be around $1.1 B of FCF per QTR assuming everything is consistent. (Highly doubt its that high but whatever)\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/david-tepper-says-he-s-bullish-much-loathed-oil-stocks\n\nAlso, BOA had a call with OXY as the last presenter and here is the transcript\nhttps://www.oxy.com/investors/Documents/BAML%202020%20Conference%20Presentation%20Transcript.pdf\n\nThis presentation let us know that OXY plans on continuing its divestment of non-core assets while retaining a large amount of the purchased Anadarko acreage. Recently, OXY divested $508 million set of properties in Reeves which was a great price per acre and flowing barrel (10k per acre ish). I think that this will shock the investment community on their Q2 and Q3 reports when they significantly reduce debt. Their focus is to push out the maturities in 2024 and pay off almost all of the debt due in the next 2 years with FCF. This will make OXY extremely attractive at the current price.\n\nOXY is a bet on the company not being a shit company. That is why my calls are set out so far. I don't trust the management but I cannot deny the money they will make give the price of oil and the land positioning of their interests in the Permian. Let me know your thoughts about what companies you see making a killing this year and this is not financial advice just thoughts about my positions.\n\nedit: updated MS price target on XOM.

{"title": "A deeper look into my $ASO", "selftext": " \n\nI’ll be honest this is my first SWOT outside of a class that I didn’t do particularly well in so it probably won’t be great. That being said I’m not too worried cuz I’m pretty sure most of you retards don’t even know what SWOT is.\n\n$ASO\n\n**Strengths** – I won’t spend too long on strengths because honestly there have been a lot of great DD on ASO, which I’ll link below.\n\nThe tl;dr of strengths is: ASO is a company in a booming outdoors stores sector with strong fundamentals that has been blowing out earnings and steadily rising since they IPO’d last October. They have a below 10 P/E and sell guns/ammo in the south (as someone who used to live in Texas I know that y’all southern motherfuckers love your fucking guns).\n\n[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o18a7j/hunting_bears_with_aso/) by [u/TSLA\\_WHISPERER](https://www.reddit.com/u/TSLA_WHISPERER/)\n\n[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o14jei/aso_this_week/) by [u/Hyptisx](https://www.reddit.com/u/Hyptisx/)\n\n[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1xxd9/get_your_aso_in_here_a_long_term_performing/) by [u/absolutcity](https://www.reddit.com/u/absolutcity/)\n\n[DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o1h53n/aso_some_sloppy_toppy_due_dickigence/) by [u/mypenismychoice](https://www.reddit.com/u/mypenismychoice/)\n\n**Weaknesses** – The same way that gun/ammo sales set ASO apart, it also could be its downfall. Gun rights are a huge hot topic in America. Regardless of how you fall on it politically, anything gun related has chance of being badly hurt by gun regulation. This is also a reason to be cautious about expansion of ASO. Although they have been great about careful and controlled expansion, their heavy involvement in gun sales could affect expansion to more regulated states. We have also seen a huge pullback in outdoorsy companies like ASO, BGFV, DKS and others the past 5 days, with ASO dropping 7% in that timeframe.\n\n**Opportunities** – This dip is a great opportunity to buy in, if you believe in the company. Before an earnings report that beat EPS expectations by 128%, the share price was 37.78. Today it closed at 37.77. It seems almost inconceivable to me that we don’t see significant growth in the coming weeks. Although I don’t rely solely on price targets, their average price target is around 45 across several different analysts. In a recent investor’s conference, they also discussed the possibility of dividends as they continue to expand and reduce debt and increase profits. We are coming out of a pandemic that will most likely drive people outside as well as increase the need for sports equipment, potentially increasing sales (although this is a double-edged sword I’ll explain below).\n\n**Threats** \\- Surprisingly, ASO has been greatly benefited by COVID. ASO was shorted pretty heavily at first because the general thought was that an outdoors store would be wrecked by COVID. In reality the pandemic caused a crazy increase in home gyms, treadmills, bikes, etc. This was a main driver of the blowout earnings ASO has reported the past two quarters. These pandemic-driven sales will obviously fall to the wayside, so if sales in other areas don’t pick up the slack we could see a slowing down in earnings and revenue from ASO stores.\n\nI honestly don’t really give a fuck if you buy ASO. I do think that ASO will continue to rise and that this is where safe money goes. I have no problem with pump and dumps, I think they are great ways to make a shit ton or lose everything, like the casino this is. If that’s all you wanna do with your portfolio, good for you, lambo or wendy’s bitch. ASO is a stock that will give you consistent and significant gains in the coming months, so I don’t want y’all to bitch at me that I didn’t warn you when I post my gain porn. And hey, if I’m wrong I promise to post my empty portfolio so it’s a win win for you bloodsucking bitches anyways.\n\nPositions\n\nA few shares\n\n40 7/16 35c\n\n39 10/15 45c", "id": "o27jb5", "created_utc": 1623963093.0, "score": 80, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|81|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o27hue/a_deeper_look_into_my_aso/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o27jb5/a_deeper_look_into_my_aso/) \n**Account Age**|3 years ago|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "When I go to a sporting goods store it’s usually Academy it’s probably the best chain one around.\nThey have a high short interest and I think they’re a valuable company.", "score": 22, "replies": []}, {"body": "> I’ll be honest this is my first SWOT outside of a **class that I didn’t do particularly well in**\n\nI’m in.\n\nEdit: In all seriousness, ASO is a great buy and I agree that it is seriously undervalued.

You're right that there will be a loss of sales from home gym equipment. But there are a lot of things that were limited or not available during the pandemic.

You also have fishing, exercise wear, camping, etc. I do agree that this is something to be wary/cautious of BUT these stores were around long before the pandemic AND have learned to adapt to online sales so I don't see them dying out once people are actually allowed to travel and go out again.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}
