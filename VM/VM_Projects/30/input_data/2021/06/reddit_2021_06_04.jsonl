But i have tried to understand some things from my mistakes and apply them in the future. I will write them out. If you have better advice I will be very grateful to learn.\n\n1. I understood I do not have the appetite to put 20k dollars in one or two large companies and just ride the downs and ups out. No matter how good the companies are.. Yes I completely misunderstood myself honestly.\nI thought Apple Amazon are large companies. Even if they go down. I will hold. I won't sell. I believe in them. Many other things. But when you invest 20k into two companies and see red, as a new investor i freaked out. One moment, i was saying to myself hold. The other moment I am reading reddit posts... Someone saying they are down 5k dollar in apple. Then r/wallstreetbets saying when citadel falls, they will take down apple with them... Reading and hearing all this I just.... Became extremely nervous...\n\n2. I have decided to invest only in etfs for now. I will equally divide my money between VOO, VOOB, VOOG VO VOT VOR... I am not comfortable with the small caps so I will stay away from them..\n\n3. I believed it was possible to earn on the stock market everyday. I did not know anything about the market. I started 2 weeks back and in 2 weeks I made 300 dollars.. I was overjoyed. I became confident and overconfident and finally made this mistake. I know it was lucky streak.\n\n4.i have observed that day trading is extremely difficult to do. That is what I tried with Apple and Amazon. On the day I bought these stocks, for one hour after buying, i was 20 dollars up.. I decided to hold and then...... I will not day trade any more.\n\n5. I learnt that currently there has been a lot of push towards financial institutions rather than tech. That is why I have decided to hedge my bets equally on the etfs i mentioned.\n\n6. I have decided to never yolo everything into company again. Maybe 4 or 5..but never one and keep a balance. For example if a market is down one day and I decided to put 5k in some companies, i will distribute my shares between tech, financial and retail.\n\n7. (This may be wrong) i have seen many days its best not to buy when the market is open. There is a lot of volatility and price may go down. Rapidly.. I have seen many times at close markets fall rapidly. I have tried after hours and pre market trading. I think buying after hours is good. But it always leaves the risk of another crash as market opens. So it may be better to look at pre market sentiments and then buy. But again this is for short term. And i don't want to do it any more.\n\n8. I saw that Apple and Amazon had a kind of flat year. I saw so many news saying Apple and Amazon has same price as aug 2020. However when i look at voo, voob and mid cap etfs.i see they have a slope.it may be small but they still have. I would rather be in a etf like that than wait for apple to make me rich.\n\n9. OH HERE is a the funniest one. I did not know that after selling a stock, you have to wait for 2 days before you can buy again. Due to repeatedly buying and selling, i had good Faith violations. This resulted in me unable to recover my losses on of the days. (i forget what i planned to do).\n\n10. I know you cannot earn money everyday in the market. I became greedy. My initial goal was to earn 50 dollars a month. I became so greedy even after earning 300 dollars.i kept on doing stupid things. Anyway i learnt my lesson. Unfortunately i still have 10k dollars stuck with Amazon. I am just hoping prime day gives me the break i need.\nI just want to get out of this mess.

I am sharing mine below. Just apply it to some companies with good capitalization that won't go bankrupt and it's easy money. It is probably far from perfect but definitely better than listening to random news.  \n\n\n  \nMy strategy uses 2 indicators. Simple moving average from last 200 weeks (blue on the screen) and min/max price from last 200 weeks (yellow on the screen). All these indicators are used for really is to determine expensive and cheap prices.  \n\n\n  \nHow to use it?  \n\n\n  \n1. Split ur total investment money into 2-3 piles.  \n2. Invest one pile per 3-5 months (this protects you from putting all money in before long bear market).  \n3. Invest 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 SMA(200) - blue line  \n4. Invest the other 1/2 of a pile when the price goes below W1 MIN(200) - bottom yellow line  \n5. No matter if you invested 1/2 or whole pile, sell 1/3 of investment when the price goes above W1 MAX(200) - top yellow line  \n6. Hold the remaining 2/3 of positions until you are happy with profit (up to you).  \n\n\n  \nYou can see example entries here: \\[https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/\\]([https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/uySEqjQE/))  \n\n\n  \nThis strategy is for investments lasting 3-5 years. Never sell a losing investment!  \n\n\n  \nThis is a very good money-making strategy, but you probably won't be able to execute it because:    \na) you won't be patient enough - sometimes the chance to enter with this strat may appear even only once a year on a given stock    \nb) you will be scared to buy when the time comes - when the price will be at the levels where you should buy, Reddit and other social media will be in panic mode - you must have balls to ignore them  \n\n\n  \nThis should be used on assets that are growing since forever (top stocks, whatever meets the condition really).  \n\n\n  \nIf you are using it you easily can ignore the news, Reddit, and other social media.

Its dizzying surge in the past few weeks has pushed its market capitalization briefly above $33 billion. The craze for so-called meme shares such as **AMC** and GameStop Corp. is being fueled by pandemic-led lockdowns and low-fee trading plans that have encouraged new investors into global share markets.\n\n“Due to social media platforms like Reddit, information today travels quickly across borders and an Indian investor is as plugged into the U.S. markets as their counterparts in the U.S.,” said Viram Shah, chief executive officer at Vested in Mumbai. “Some retail Indian investors are driven by news and want to be part of any global trends or movements.”\n\nSitashwa Srivastava, co-founder and co-chief executive officer of Stockal, said that in the last three to five months, “people have been chasing high volatility stocks a lot more. GameStop happened, and now, AMC is of great interest.”\n\n**Korean Favorite**\n\nKorean investors snapped up $225 million of **AMC** shares from Monday through Thursday, according to Korea Securities Depository data. That total is getting close to three times the amount spent on the second-most-purchased counter, Tesla, at $82 million.\n\nA popular online forum among Korean retail investors contained dozens of posts from traders known locally as “ants,” discussing the prospects for **AMC** stock prices, and whether Blackberry Ltd. might replace AMC as the next meme target.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-investors-india-south-korea-090430832.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/retail-investors-india-south-korea-090430832.html)", "id": "nsbscp", "created_utc": 1622830919.0, "score": 198, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "Worldwide we like the stonk", "score": 63, "replies": [{"body": "The only way is up ⬆️", "score": 13, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "WSB is gonna spread faster than covid ever did.", "score": 52, "replies": [{"body": "AMC is a pandemic I could live with.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "From twice a year, let's make it every quarter so our Apes can stay fit!", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Sounds like a good plan but don't tell Boris", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Common, we need the traffic light system, lol!", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Ok you can tell Boris", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "AMC to 100$ next week look at options hit price it will tell you everything 😉🚀🦍", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wow, how'd this upbeat AMC post survive the mods?", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "It didn't break the rules.\n\nApparently that's pretty tough for 90% of the things that get posted.", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "Right.
