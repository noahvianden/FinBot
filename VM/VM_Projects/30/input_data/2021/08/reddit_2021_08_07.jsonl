{"title": "The German mRNA developer Biontech will report earnings on Monday. How will they compare to Moderna?", "selftext": "BioNTech\n\nGermany-based BioNTech S.E. (NASDAQ: BNTX) is the co-developer (with Pfizer) of one of the COVID-19 vaccines. Over the past 12 months, the stock is up about 370%, and for the year to date, shares are 380%. The stock jumped about 9% on Wednesday following a report that the FDA would soon approve the vaccine, removing the emergency use authorization under which it has been distributed since late last year.\n\n\nAnother vaccine maker, Moderna, reported better-than-expected results Thursday morning and announced a $1 billion share buyback. Investors are never happy: the stock traded down about 2% afterward.\n\nAnalyst sentiment on BioNTech is decidedly cool. Of 12 brokerages covering the stock, eight have a Hold rating and the other four are evenly split between Buy and Sell ratings. The stock trades at around $392.50, more than double the median price target of $184.11 and just $6 (1.5%) below the high price target of $398.44.\n\nFor the second quarter, analysts expect BioNTech to report revenue of $3.88 billion, up 61.4% sequentially and 91% above the same period a year ago. Adjusted EPS are forecast at $8.96, up 74% sequentially. In the second quarter of 2020, the company posted a loss per share of $0.38. For the full year, analysts are looking for EPS of $35.95, compared with a year-ago total of $0.07.\n\nThe stock trades at 9.8 times expected 2021 EPS, 10.8 times estimated 2022 earnings and 18.4 times estimated 2023 earnings. The stock’s 52-week range is $54.10 to $433.90.
