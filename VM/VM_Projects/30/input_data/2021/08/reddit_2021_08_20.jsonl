I tried using a couple of valuation formulas I’ve found but they returned impossible numbers so maybe I’ll try to find some new ones.

Let me explain:\n\nCHWY is Amazon’s largest competitor in the pets eCommerce space. Do you know what it’s like to be a competitor against Amazon?\n\nNO you don’t. So let me tell you.\n\nAmazon always engages in overly aggressive competitive behavior by lowering prices at a loss just to take out any competition. Some say that’s a monopoly…..🤪\n\nThis is obviously bad news for CHWY, but what you don’t know is that Amazon may be a bully, but this is a story of David vs Goliath.\n\nCHWY has been crushing earnings after earnings and the stock price has been increasing, while AMZN loving retards have been trying to short the stock in hopes that Amazon will crush them. The current short interest is 16.25% which is not the highest, but it’s been increasing.\n\nIt’s sad to see the pressure from the bullies over at Amazon trying to sink this stock, but what they don’t know is that we had a reddit family of retarded all-in betting mindless ape warriors. These apes aren’t going to just let the bullies win.\n\nIt’s like they didn’t learn their lesson from GME & AMC.\n\nWe’re not going to let them get away with this one. We’re going 3 for 3.\n\nLet’s show Jeff Bezos how to build a real rocket that doesn’t blow up. 🚀\n\nSo who’s f**ing in? 👊\n\nAnd if you have paper hands don’t even think about buying this stock. The diamonds will be too heavy for you. 💎💎💎\n\nNot financial advice. I yolo’d my portfolio on this. Riding the spaceship to the moon. 🚀🌕\n\nCurrently holding about 400 contracts and 4650 CHWY shares.
