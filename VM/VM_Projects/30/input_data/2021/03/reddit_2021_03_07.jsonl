I am always tracking different SPY strangles and trade them selectively on and off on a relatively small scale (for me). \n\nWhat you describe is not unusual but not typical either. SPY strangles are capable of just about anything, including sizeable profits. I traded 17 SPY strangles in 2020 and that was very profitable, but of course a lot of that was due to a single potent combo, the Mar 20 expiry (sold before expiry, alas, leaving a lot on the table) bought on Feb 4. The other 16 trades were also slightly profitable, mostly because these pay off when SPY has a lot of tail events, and SPY had a lot of tail events in 2020.\n\nMy two trades so far this year are doing poorly (in fact the four trades since last November are doing poorly). There is a good reason for that. Remember that the financial media consensus was the prediction of possibly extreme volatility around the November election, then the interregnum, then the change of presidents? That volatility never appeared, and SPY went through a months-long period of absolutely no tail events at all (as I measure them) combined with a slow drop in volatility. That is deadly for strangles.\n\nWhen I trade them I buy then 6 to 8 weeks before maturity and trade out about three weeks before maturity. That reduces the theta effect.\n\nYou do not have to experience tail events to profit from index strangles. A strong, sustained rise or fall also pays because of the strong delta/gamma effects. If you get to the point that one of deltas is at 70 and the other at 25 (absolute values) then the strangle really starts to pay (but you the very difficult decision of when to exit).\n\nI don't recommend trading index strangles as a viable options strategy, especially for novices. I trade volatility a lot (I trade VIX futures a lot, often for hedges) so I am pretty good at getting the most out of them. They are never going to pay off consistently.\n\nThey do offer a certain type of hedge, though.\n\nI sometimes (including right now) use index strangles as a black-swan hedge. If you get used to juggling these, you can kind of keep this type of hedge cost-neutral (as opposed to just buying a put or, say, shorting ES) and they really pay during a black swan (of course) or even just a large tail event (like a \"correction\").\n\nFinal note: none of this has anything to do with \"IV crush,\" which is an issue on earnings strangles, which I also do, but not here.", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is why r/thetagang advocates for selling options rather than buying.

I understand that is it always wiser to sell the contract back to market rather than exercising it due to the extrinsic value of the contract.

I sold a PMCC at 120strike. If the share reaches 130 at expiry, isn't it better to close my 120c prior expiry even though i suffer a loss (if u decided not to roll it) since your leap at 50 will make it up for the loss due to the delta difference vs. Selling the leap and buying the share waiting to get assigned at expiry.\n\nThanks for clarifying this doubt of mine.
