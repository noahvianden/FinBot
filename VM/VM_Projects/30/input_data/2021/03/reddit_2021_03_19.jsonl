I don’t get this concept.\n\nThey are kind of related but not really.  They are more separate than linked.\n\nLet's start with inflation.  Inflation generally occurs in large amounts when there is a prolonged period of high velocity money printing.\n\nA relatively recent example of this is pre-WWII Germany.  In this period, the German government employed a large number of its citizens to print money.  The recounts of the paper mills and printing presses are staggering.  In those days, they had to physically print the bills.  So, they did this for months and months and months and months.  Ultimately, it caused rampant inflation and economic collapse.\n\nSo, there is fear from some US investors that the combination of the 3 stimulus packages, the US government's history of running a deficit, and the federal reserve's current monetary policy will cause inflation.\n\nThis is more or less the inflation argument.  I wouldn't panic or get super worried over it.  The US government has economic tools to create and to reduce inflation.  If it starts to get too high, they can reign it in.\n\nNext, the US Treasury bond interest rates are set by the US Treasury.  At its core, it is that simple.  Any given week, the bankers get together and decide how many bonds they want to sell and at what rate.  Then, they go out and try to sell them.  The results of the sale determine what happens going into the next week when they try to sell more.  If no one bought last week's set of bonds, they likely need to raise the interest rates to make them more attractive to buyers for the following week.\n\nNow, the logical follow-up question, \"Why are people not buying them?\", is a very hard question to answer and is beyond what I know and can explain on the internet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The rates don’t seem that high compared to what they were 10/20/30 years ago\n\nThis is correct.  The US government has been pushing interest rates down since about the 1980s to stimulate the economy.  This is worrisome to certain US investors but, again, is beyond my understanding and ability explain.\n\nAnd finally, stock prices.\n\nThere is a math equation analysts use to predict the future value of stock prices.  So, think like: \"x + y + z + w = stock price in the future\"\n\nOne of those variables is the interest rate.  When the interest rate goes up, the stock price the math equation produces gets smaller.  So, large institutions and investors start selling as the interest rate climbs.", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "This guy gave you the perfect answer but I’ll add a caveat.

To fill in the one gap, people are not buying bonds because there are more things to spend money in a healthy economy. Individuals ramp up spending on “real” things like houses, cars, and vacations. Businesses greatly increase spending on expansions into new businesses or new countries, adding inventory, extra marketing, etc... In a not so good economy this money is mostly invested in stocks and bonds instead. \n\nAt that point you have significantly less demand for both stocks and bonds. For bonds, borrowers and investors start selling them cheaper (meaning better yields) to compensate for the lower demand. Then people with lower risk tolerance or higher liquidity needs (mainly banks and businesses) sell a portion of their stocks to take advantage of the safer bond opportunities.\n\nSo when the dust settles it’s the same number of bonds being bought and sold.

Higher discount rate means lower valuations. \n\nRising yields also increase the cost of borrowing which means less available cash for growth initiatives. If the company can’t grow, neither can their stock price. \n\nHigher bond yields also make bonds more attractive leading to a rotation out of equities.. we haven’t really seen this yet, but I’d expect this if/when 10 yr hits around 3-3.5%. \n\nRates are not high relative to historical norms but we’ve been in a suppressed environment for 10+ years.

I buy 3 shares @ $80/ea for $240.\n\nI will then wait for a pullback of over 5 percent below my last purchase price. Higher depending on how volatile the stock is. Let's say I purchase an additional 5 shares every time it drops 8% below my last purchase price for AMD. This is a really conservative example and could be done with a number of different ratios. I just don't want to get burned in a sell off everyone keeps talking about so I am treading lightly on my positions. It also can drop 5 percent in a single day without much trouble recently. My \"bottom\" for this would be back to pre-covid levels which would be a really severe sell off and almost completely unlikely.   \n\n\n3 shares @ $80 - $240  \n3 shares @ $73.60 - $220.8  \n3 shares @ $67.71 - $203.13  \n3 shares @ $62.29 - $186.87  \n3 shares @ $57.31 - $171.93\n\nTotal position - $1,022.73\n\nCost basis - 15 shares @ $68.18/ea\n\nObviously this is a bit rough when the price is only $57 and you have a $68 cost basis but this would be worst case scenario. You also didn't over leverage yourself into a single position and were able to ride the price down roughly 30 percent over possibly a couple of months. On the flip side if the price goes up... and up... and up.... you only have $200 in and wanted $1000. I personally say \"oh well\" and wait for a serious pull back in the future but I won't chase the price up. I will be content with my small position and put money into a different company. \n\nI am a bit more bearish about the rest of 2021 so this is my strategy getting into new positions. I will go with 30+ percent on my opening position if I really believe in the company regardless of share price. Hopefully I am wrong and I have a bunch of small positions doing really well! \n\nThis was never practical when there were $6 fees for every transaction!", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Mathematically yes.

The ban, relayed to residents of military housing this week, was triggered by concerns that the world’s biggest maker of electric vehicles is collecting sensitive data via the cars’ in-built cameras in a way the Chinese government can’t see or control, one of the people said.\n\nImages of what was purported to be a notice about the ban were also circulating on Chinese social media. Multi-direction cameras and ultrasonic sensors in Tesla cars may “expose locations” and the vehicles are being barred from military residences to ensure the safety of confidential military information, the notice said.\n\nA representative for Tesla in China declined to comment on the military’s move. China’s Defense Ministry didn’t immediately respond to a fax sent after after business hours.\n\nTesla, like many other automakers including General Motors Co., uses several small cameras, mainly located on the outside of the vehicle, to help guide parking, autopilot and self-driving functions. Most Tesla models also have an interior camera mounted above the rear view mirror that can be used to detect whether a driver is looking at the road, looking down at their lap, wearing sunglasses, or looking at something else entirely.\n\nInternal Camera\n\nThe California-based company -- which produces Model 3s and Model Y SUV crossovers at a Gigafactory near Shanghai -- hasn’t shied away from that fact, with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeting in April 2019 that the internal camera is there “for when we start competing with Uber/Lyft and people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet.”\n\n“In case someone messes up your car, you can check the video,” Musk explained.\n\nSince then, Tesla has started using cars’ internal cameras to monitor what it calls FSD (full self driving) beta testers, or Tesla owners who have volunteered to test out the company’s driver-assist capabilities.\n\nEarlier this month, Musk tweeted that the company’s FSD beta trial had been expanded to around 2,000 owners but Tesla had also “revoked beta where drivers did not pay sufficient attention to the road.” Musk said the next significant release of FSD beta would be in April.\n\nConcern over this program contributed to the ban by the military, one of the people said.\n\nNone of the in-car cameras in Teslas sold in China are turned on or part of the FSD beta trial, the Tesla representative said. Tesla’s privacy policies comply with national laws and local regulations in China, they said.\n\nChina Apology\n\nChina, the world’s biggest market for EVs, is key to Musk’s global growth ambitions.

{"title": "TSLA options chain unwinding", "selftext": "Just curious what everyones thoughts on this are, I was taking a look at the TSLA options chain and realised how massive it is and how many positions will begin to not have hedges needed anymore. Because of the unprecedented run up there is ITM strikes down to $1... There is at minimum 100,000 ITM options expiring this week, definitely more than that but I wasnt gonna sit down and get more than a rough count. As the year goes on a metric fuckton will continue unraveling. Obviously a lot of people will be exercising these options but a lot also will not, expecially the higher strikes. Combine this with the market turning into this kangaroo shit show especially with tech and a lot of people might just take the cash.\n\n\nI also cant help but think of the volume on calls once we get into mid year/once everyone found it it was free money to just buy tesla calls. I havent checked the chain but the OI has to be unprecedented in combination with mass groups of people discovering options and being locked at home.\n\n\nIm just some idiot but cant this potentially be a giant derisking event?\n\nEdit; just got bored and did next weeks expiring options up to $600. **There is 814,000 options expiring on 3/27 and thats rounding every number down so its actually more than that. There is potential of 81 million tesla shares smacking the market in the next two weeks alone.**\n\nRealistically by the end of april we could see the entire float dumped on the market.
