{"title": "Farm Gang", "selftext": "Hi cock suckers and carpet munchers. We’ve all been hearing about the recovery plays in oil, infrastructure, casinos, restaurants and so on. The one I have not been hearing about as much is the big recovery as it relates to the agriculture stonks. Figured I would give you all a few more ideas to chew on. \n\nThe last few years have been absolute shit for farmers, with many of them going bankrupt or barely scraping by. Some of this is due to poor environmental conditions, some of it was trade war related, and the pandemic compounded all of those already existing problems. \n\nWhere we are now - shit is getting back on track. A lot of this has to do with China and their need to rebuild their pork population. For those who don’t know, Chinese pigs got fucked by a quiet pandemic in 2019 - African Swine Fever. This causes them to buy a lot of soybeans and corn to feed all those fuckin pigs, sending the futures flying. We had a corn gang a little while ago, but this is now spreading to the rest of the farm. \n\nUSDA is projecting a record number of acres to be planted this year in response to the demand, and with the Chinese showing no signs of slowing down, in addition to the volatile weather wiping out crops at random, farmers need to keep production higher as well. China is essentially back in full force post pandemic, and the US is just really starting to see the first signs of normalcy. This only adds to the demand and for different kinds of crops. \n\nOn a separate note, there is a rediscovery of the outdoors and personal farming has been taking off. The booming weed industry can also give the general farming industry a boost as that will require all of the same inputs. \n\nThings like farming equipment, fertilizers, etc. are in high demand. There isn’t one specific way to play this so I will list a few solid names from each category. Some of these stocks have run up, but let’s be real - what fucking hasn’t at this point? This is a cyclical boom in all things farming that can last for a very long time.\n\nPositions- \n\nMy personal position is selling MOS puts, because I hate sucking theta dick with my butt and there have been extremely bullish options flow/high liquidity in the chain. \n\nEquipment - DE, CAT, AGCO, RAVN (also loved by cathie bae)\n\nFertilizers/chemicals - BG, MOS, NTR, CTVA, SMG, CF\n\nGeneral - ADM, DBA (don’t love DBA as a futures based ETF for reasons beyond the scope of the post, but you can see why with a simple search)\n\nDramatically increased issues with China, weaker recovery than expected, more volatile weather than is typically expected are factors that can hurt this overall play.

Oh, it also means that using their skateboard means you have less control over how you build a car.\n\nFinally, the skateboard is going to be an inferior platform once Tesla puts out their frame with the single casts and the 4680 battery.\n\nSorry to say, this DD about Canoo is ridiculous optimism. Might work to push the stock higher in the short term, but once Tesla starts producing cars from Texas and Berlin, investors will realize that what Canoo is offering does not make sense.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "You make it sound like Tesla and Canoo are competing in the same market. They’re not. Canoo is making everything that Tesla isn’t: a compact pickup truck, consumer minibus/robotaxi and commercial cargo van.\n\nAll of Canoo’s models share a single skateboard allowing them to drive the costs down. Their MPDV starts at $33k, making it cheaper than any cargo van, gas or electric. This is before a federal tax credit which brings it down to $26k. While Tesla has driven their costs down, they no longer qualify for the federal tax credit. Meaning buyers are willing to spend more for a non-Tesla vehicle, than a Tesla.\n\nSince all Canoo models share the same skateboard that has completed crash testing, they can rapidly develop models on top of it. Should the market demand a cross-over, they can rapidly develop it if neeed.\n\nAs far as the Canoo’s skateboard limiting the design of a car, that is far from the truth. Since the skateboard is the flattest in the industry, it offers the greatest flexibility in design. There are no protruding strut towers, the HVAC is built into the skateboard allowing greater interior volume, it has steer-by-wire so no steering column and rack would get in the way, and so on.\n\nI also like Tesla. But you make it sound like it’s the end all, be all, of the auto industry. I’ve reserved a tri-motor Cybertruck with FSD, but I fear this $80K truck will have the build quality of a 1990s KIA. Tesla consistently ranks low, if not the lowest, among its peers, for build quality. On that note, should Ford, GM, VW and etc kill their EV platforms? Of course not.\n\nAs far as investments go, who do you think will triple first? Tesla from $700b to $2T+, passing Apple and Amazon, making it the world's most valuable company? Or would it be Canoo from $3b to $9b, making it a fraction of its nearest competitor, Lucid at $65b?", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "They said their MPDV will start at $33k. When they actually sell and deliver a version of it at that price, I will believe it. More like every other EV manufacturer their early models will cost significantly more with the cheaper models to start delivery at some future point. At this time it is an unproven vehicle from a company with no proof they can get to mass production.\n\nThe federal tax credit... Decent chance Biden and the democrats do something to offer it further for all EV's, so that is not going to help Canoo compete against Tesla, assuming that Tesla was competing in the vehicle class. Further, Tesla's 4680 cells in 2022 or 2023 (or probably later when Canoo maybe gets around to selling their vehicle before going bankrupt) will cost half, if not even less, then what Canoo will pay for the battery cells. So Canoo's 80 kWh battery pack will cost them $10K+ for the cells, while Tesla's cost will be half that amount for those cells. That plus greater economies of efficiency, will mean Tesla will not have any trouble competing with that missing $7,500 (not even getting into things like single-casting).\n\nAs to Canoo's skateboard completing crash testing, this is simply ridiculous. Canoo themselves said it is 70% of the crash safety components. This means that anything you build with it still needs to undergo crash testing. I mean, making up nonsense the company itself claims otherwise is just stupid.\n\nSteer-by-wire - I mean on this alone anyone with a brain would short the stock. Maybe I should buy puts before Hindenburg sniffs this out, because it is a ref flag with an alarm that should warn investors away. Must jurisdictions make it illegal to not have direct linkage of the steering to the wheels. Please let us know how some start-up is going to change that! Tesla and others are all working on steer by wire, but there are significant issues with the technology. Number one, what happens if your power goes (I guess a similar question can be asked about self-driving... but with self-driving you need to show the technology is overall safer then people driving by a good margin, whereas steer by wire, is almost certainly less safer as it does not add anything safety wise)? Combined with brake by wire, you can't stop nor can you steer. The amount of proving before such technology will be legalized is going to be a major hurdle that I have not seen even talked about anyplace.\n\nAs to build quality issues with Tesla... Tesla in China is rated number 1. The main issues with Tesla in Fremont are panel gaps and cosmetic type issues. With the new factories and new builds (single casts..) I would expect Tesla's end of this year or next when they start production to improve in quality to the top of the pack.\n\nAs far as the stock price, no idea. Canoo can triple in value or more, until someone like Hindenburg comes out and takes apart the overstated beliefs or claims about them. Or maybe no, maybe they are legit and everything will work out. I would be very skeptical.\n\nWith $286M or so in assets and a market cap of $3.5, figure when investors lose hope in them, there is plenty of room for their share price to fall. The only reason I have not bought Puts is because they only got out to August. While I think it is pretty much a given their stock will tank eventually, I don't know if August is long enough time to give. On the other hand, well-known short firms are realizing that many EV stocks are a bubble (I was recently calling out Lordstown motor over their questionable in-wheel motor and guess what the other day Hindenburg takes them down), so probably just a matter of time before someone publicly takes them down.\n\nLook, I am trying to be pragmatic, but reality is magic does not work. You will not be able to make money with EV's unless you put out superior vehicles that people want. There is limited battery supply, but there is not limited company's willing to make EV's. So if Canoo found a profitable niche, guess what, someone else will want to compete there and go to the same battery suppliers and offer them more money if there is profit to be made. Tesla's success is not going to be easy for anyone to replicate at any level.\n\nAnyways, good luck with your investment. If I have some free cash, I will probably buy Puts on GOEV as I think that outcome is far more likely then success.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I mean a lot of auto makers pull parts from 3rd parties, DANA makes axles for pretty much every car out there for example.

{"title": "AFRM offers 84% upside potential.", "selftext": "I’m putting a price target of $145 on the shares, representing enormous opportunity from current levels ($79).  Here’s my thesis:  Affirm charges merchants -- including COVID-19 lockdown beneficiary Peloton -- to take on the risk of customers who want to pay with installments. Millennials are driving a change in the traditional idea of paying by credit, and investors now have a way to play that trend in the U. S. Affirm allows consumers to split purchases into installments. The company is modernizing the world of payments by offering an option to make purchases over time without incurring interest for consumers.\n\nAffirm makes money on its \"0% APR\" installment options by taking a cut of the merchant end of the transaction. The idea is that merchants are willing to pay Affirm to conduct risk modeling and offer its service as a way to boost conversion to a sale. The 0% APR options generally nets the company its largest fees from merchants, though it also offers \" simple-interest\" loans through which it receives fixed interest payments on the consumer end as well.\n\nMax Levchin co-founded Affirm in 2012. He has an impressive pedigree as one of PayPal’s co-founders. While everyone recognizes Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, you shouldn’t dismiss Levchin’s contribution – he is a powerhouse. We are impressed when someone creates an empire and helps revolutionize the way business is done. We have great faith in him as Affirm’s CEO.\n\nLevchin is a disruptor and is changing the way people pay for goods and how they pay for them over time. Seeking to set the credit card world on its head, the company appeals to both consumers and merchants with a simple, attractive proposition. His vision for the company is to be as “ubiquitous, secure, and convenient as legacy networks, yet far more transparent, honest, and both consumer- and merchant-centric.”\n\nThe company is the online lender on the consumer front, and brings clarity on the amount owed and when it is due. A major portion of its business is helping merchants provide 0% financing, and it has signed up major companies like Priceline, Gucci, Dyson, and Expedia. The consumer-centric approach means the company doesn’t charge late fees and interest is not compounded. That is, it is simple interest. The company profits by treating its customers fairly, rather than by gouging them with high interest and unreasonable fees. Profitability is based on growing consumer acceptance, which in turn, makes it more valuable for merchants to offer. For merchants, the company is focused on helping them improve their brand, gain more customers, and increase sales. Affirm earns revenue from this source when it facilitates a sale and payment.\n\nAffirm and Shopify struck an agreement in July through which Shopify would list Affirm as a payment option, giving the company exposure to Shopify's vast base of merchants. Affirm will pay Shopify a fee for each sale processed through its platform, and the company will be Shopify's exclusive partner for such payment options over the course of the arrangement, which lasts three years initially and then subsequently renews for additional one-year terms unless one party decides to discontinue the arrangement.\n\nThe company is past the proof-of-concept stage. There are over 6.2 million (!) consumers that have signed up, having completed over 17 million transactions, and the company works with over 6,500 merchants. Gross Merchandise Value\\* (GMV) was $10.7 billion over the last three years. Last year, about 64% of its loans were made to repeat customers.\n\nThe company went public on January 13th at $49, pricing 25 million shares above the $41 to $44 range. There was strong demand for the IPO. Opening at $91, it reached $103 on the first day of trading. The following day, it went to $138.  Now the stock in trading in the 80s meaning you can get it for less than the IPO.\n\nThere is a long runway for continued strong revenue growth that will drive earnings improvement. This will continue fueling the stock.\n\nFounder and CEO Max Levchin controls 20% of the company. Counting him, directors and officers control 31% of the shares. There are very well-known investors that continue to hold major interests. The Founders Fund (a venture capital firm with $3 billion under management, which includes Brian Singerman, Peter Thiel, and Keith Rabois,) has 7%. Khosla Ventures (5%), Lightspeed Ventures (7%), Jasmine Ventures (9%), and Shopify (8%) all have significant ownership. With strong leadership and a unique business model that continues to prove itself, Affirm will continue attracting younger consumers and merchants.
