Now over night, I'm reading how tech is overpriced, SPACs are in a bubble, you most rotate to value stocks, Palantir earnings are decreeaimg making bigger loses, workhorse is fake company, and lost a big contract. NIO is at a risk of being delisted because it's a Chinese company (like we didn't know this before), chip shortage will slow down the production ect..I feel like I'm being manipulated by all that news and lied.

{"title": "2 benefits of the wheel that I haven't seen anyone really talking about", "selftext": "I've dabbled in the stock market for 20+ years with mixed results,  and just started wheeling in January. So far I am very happy with the results despite making some mistakes, learning some lessons, and taking some hard hits this week.\n\nThere are 2 things that I feel have been a real benefit  to me bedsides collection of premium. Since I haven't noticed any discussions about them, I thought I'd mention them\n\n1. It's helping me to build a bigger and more solid portfolio.\n\nI was never good about investing the way you're  supposed to, with dollar cost averaging, diversification, etc. I had a very variable income so tended to invest sporadically in big chunks and then do nothing for long stretches of time. Not a good plan.\n\nNow, I'm collecting premium every week and building up cash I wouldn't have otherwise had, which I have then used to purchase additional shares in new companies (which I am also running the wheel on). So long as I keep doing this, I should be buying new shares pretty regularly, which will mean that if the market tanks and everything goes on sale I should still be picking up things at a great price rather than missing out as I'd usually have done.\n\nI started wheeling with 200 shares of a now-hefty and very wheelable stock I bought cheap in 2014 and hope to continue to own quite a bit longer. Now, I still have the 200 shares, plus an additional 100 shares each in 3 relatively  inexpensive but hopefully solid companies that I am happy to own (even the one that sank like a stone this week). \n\nI'd have even  more had I not made some rookie mistakes along the way, but I'm still very pleased with the result. Had I not wheeled, I'd have nothing other than the original shares - which are currently 12% down from where they were when I started my wheel.\n\n2. It makes buy/sell decisions much more systematic and helped me stop being paralyzed by indecisiveness.\n\nHaving had some big losses over the years, I'm a very nervous investor. After I dropped a huge chunk into tech stocks about a month before the giant 2000 bubble burst, I was too scared to buy anything for about 5 years. I eventually started investing again but never had any confidence that any decision I made wouldn't be another disastrous mistake.\n\nWhen I finally got lucky and picked a stock that took off fast, I had no clue what to do. I was pretty sure that if I didn't sell it the stock would tank back down and all my paper gains would vanish, but that if I sold it would surely skyrocket and I'd feel like an idiot.\n\nWhen I started selling calls on my 200 shares, all that fear and indecisiveness went away. I write them pretty far OTM, since I'd prefer to hang onto it. But if it gets called away, I'm ok with that and will just start  selling CSPs to see if I can get it back. If it gets so far away from me that I can't get it back, I'll be OK with that and will find something else to buy instead.  \n\nSo far, I've been exercised once and had 100 shares called away, and got them back at the same price the next week with a much higher premium than I usually try to make on the call side.", "id": "md86hq", "created_utc": 1616705703.0, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "Since you said you entered the market before 2000, which was 21 years ago, I'll assume you're already in your late forties or early fifties.

So long as I keep doing this, I should be buying new shares pretty regularly, which will mean that if the market tanks and everything goes on sale I should still be picking up things at a great price rather than missing out as I'd usually have done.\n\nThis works as long as you're picking up solid premium every week. But during a crash, such as the one in 2000, *that won't be the case*. Your underlying will be crushed in a real crash - as you are aware - but what you probably aren't so aware of is that *premium on covered calls will also crash* during a major decline.\n\nSo don't assume you'll have the benefit of a consistent cash flow when the market crashes. Most likely, you won't, unless the crash is short and sharp. A slow moving bear market like those following the 2000 crash is disastrous for call premiums. You won't be able to scratch out enough premium to consistently buy shares.\n\nIn that kind of situation, cash is king - that piece of wisdom endures regardless of what strategies you use.

I totally understand that I'd be generating much less cash and it would definitely take me longer to save up enough cash from premium to buy new shares. \n\nBut wouldn't volatility also rise and help out with premiums a bit?
