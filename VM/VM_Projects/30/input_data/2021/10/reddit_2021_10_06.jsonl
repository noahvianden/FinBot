I don't frequent any other finance/investing/trading subreddits, so maybe it's common on Reddit, but I've never seen it anywhere else online nor heard it in real life.\n\nTo really go down the pet peeve rabbit hole, though, the corruption of \"literally\" is not that people use it to mean \"figuratively,\" just that they use it as a generic intensifier.
