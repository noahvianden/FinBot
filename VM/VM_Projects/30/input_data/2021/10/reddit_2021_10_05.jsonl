{"title": "A raging bull case for GOOGL/GOOG", "selftext": "Obviously Google isn't some hidden gem. It's a huge company, on everyone's radar and has been for years. But I think the market is still underestimating its potential. \n\nLet's start with the basics. They have consistently blown up earnings. Most recently, revenue was up 60% yoy, income up 166%, and profit margin up 64%. Their P/E is around 30, which is high, but consistent with other tech stocks. \n\nIt should be noted that a large chunk of their income is invested into high-risk/high-reward research. This inflates the P/E because it cuts down earnings even though the investments improve the potential for larger returns in the future.\n\nThey have what I believe to be the largest moat in the tech sector due to their sheer size, their collection of patents, and their reputation that attracts elite tech workers and researchers. \n\nThat all makes a bull case from their bread-and-butter profit-making, but all of that is arguably priced in and somewhat similar to other large tech companies. So, why do I think that GOOG is not just a bull, but a \\*raging\\* bull? Their research divisions. They have their hand in just about every potentially explosive area of research. \n\nAI/machine learning? I'm a researcher in a field that is tangent to machine learning. Google, DeepMind, GoogleBrain (all under Alphabet=GOOGL/GOOG) are all considered among the most elite places to work in the field. For example, AlphaFold recently created a breakthrough algorithm to simulate protein folding, with a potential to revolutionize drug design. There are lots of good machine learning startups out there, and most of their leaders dream of being bought by GOOG. \n\nQuantum Computing? Google's QuantumAI is breaking new ground so fast that public, government-backed projects can't keep up. No other large company has their hand in this, potentially high-reward, field right now.\n\nMicrochips? Google designed their own TPUs, which are better than GPUs for machine learning, etc. How many software companies design their own chips?\n\nMaybe none of those ever take off for Alphabet, but they'll keep acquiring researchers and companies on the cutting edge of technology and some of them will eventually blast off.\n\nBasically, whatever new tech-related industry blasts off next, you can be sure that Alphabet will have their finger in the pie, if they don't have the whole pie to themselves.\n\nDisclosure: I own two tickers, VTI (88%) and GOOG (12%). \n\nGOOG is down 5% in the last month and I have cash, so I'll probably buy a bunch more.

Initially IBM did not believe in the PC revolution nor did they want to cannibalize their high revenue mainframe business, so they did not bother developing PCs. Once Apple took off they realized their mistake and wanted to quickly rush a PC to market. They quickly made the hardware but needed an operating system. Instead of developing their own they looked to hire an outsider to do it since that would be faster. They entered into an agreement with Microsoft that allowed Microsoft to retain the rights of the operating system.  This initially seemed fine since IBM dominated hardware, so they did not anticipate what would come next: dozens of competitors rip apart IBM personal computers, reverse engineer them, and then build their own IBM PC clones. The competitors sell the clones for a fraction of the cost of the IBM computer and take away huge market share. Meanwhile Microsoft is laughing their way to the bank as they own the rights to the operating system and make money regardless of who the hardware provider is. \n\nIBM realizes that they need to lower the cost of their products to compete in the marketplace so they look to cut costs. They cut back significantly on hiring. So where do all the top engineers go to? Not IBM but other tech companies like Microsoft and Oracle (and eventually Google, Facebook, etc).\n\n\nSo essentially they had no moat, and stopped hiring talent.

If you want to see the entire article, do a quick internet search on the title of this post and it will be there. I didn't post the link as it is against WSB's rules to post from that site. **I personally agree with the points below but let me know what your thoughts are in the comments.**\n\n# Summary\n\n* Marathon Oil is finally showing upside momentum again as investors recognize the company's benefits in a world desperately in need of affordable energy.\n* The company is on pace to generate $2.0 billion in free cash flow this year, which will do wonders to balance sheet health, and dividend growth.\n* Even after doubling this year, the stock is attractively valued and well-positioned for strong, long-term gains.\n\n# Introduction\n\nWe're living in truly remarkable times. Right now, we're witnessing some of the worst global supply chain issues in modern times and rapidly rising inflation. One way to protect a portfolio against inflation is by buying high-quality oil assets. I have 17% exposure in my long-term dividend account consisting of Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and Valero Energy (VLO). I also own some smaller oil stocks on the side, which are **Marathon Oil (MRO)** and Devon Energy (DVN). This article is about Marathon Oil as the stock just made new highs with support from a ton of macro fundamentals. As I haven't discussed the stock since May, it's time to once again reflect on one of America's finest oil stocks. So, bear with me!\n\n# Must-Own Oil\n\nI have started a lot of oil-related articles this way, but I am a huge believer in owning high-quality oil assets. In this case, I define high-quality oil as a company with a solid footprint in the oil industry, a solid balance sheet, and the ability to pay a high dividend. After all, being long energy isn't always fun as everyone who held energy assets for more than a year will agree with.\n\nFor example, the Energy ETF (XLE) - which is basically 50% XOM and CVX - is still down 46% from its 2014 highs. Including dividends, the decline is -29%. The situation at Marathon is different as the stock is down 62% from its 2014 highs. This includes dividends.\n\nBefore I continue to discuss why this will continue to change (dividend growth is picking up), let's take a quick look at the macro environment because oil is back!\n\nFor the first time since 2018, it looks like oil will make a successful attempt at breaking above the massive resistance area close to $75.\n\nIf that happens, oil could easily continue its uptrend and **force people into inflation trades.** Using the ratio between the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF (XOP) and the S&P 500, we see that energy assets are still extremely poorly performing compared to the stock market. I don't disagree that the post-2014 downtrend was justified because we were in a rather deflationary environment. Now, that's changing and investors are seriously underweight energy.\n\nAccording to the State Street [website](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/intermediary/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy), the S&P 500 has just 2.75% energy exposure. For example, industrials are at 8% and utilities are 2.5%. Information technology exposure is 27.6%.\n\nAll of this sounds good, but we need a reason to make the case for this rotation. In May, when I wrote my most recent Marathon Oil article, I discussed an expected supply/demand imbalance.\n\n>First of all, I am a big believer in a demand/supply imbalance. Unlike in the previous recovery, we are now NOT dealing with a situation where supply is outperforming demand. According to EIA data (graph below), we are about to witness an extended period with negative to flat inventory changes as demand will likely outpace supply. As EIA expectations are often very conservative, I think that this effect will be bigger than some might think. Especially once economies reopen, we will see a rapid increase in energy demand.\n\nThis supply/demand imbalance is now materializing in a huge way. And not just in oil. All over the world, we're seeing the need for affordable energy. Here are some examples.\n\nNewcastle Coal futures are going through the roof as China and India desperately need coal to maintain growth and because natural gas prices are exploding as well - coal is a cheap alternative.\n\nAs Reuters [writes](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-slips-opec-weighs-output-boost-tight-market-2021-10-01/), there's a huge need for affordable fuel, and that's where oil benefits from.\n\n>\"If OPEC+ sticks to the script and only delivers the planned 400,000 bpd increase in November, energy markets will shortly be seeing $90 oil prices,\" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA, adding that any increase smaller than 600,000 barrels should boost prices.Oil is also finding support as a surge in natural gas prices globally prompts power producers to move away from gas. Generators in Pakistan, Bangladesh and the Middle East have started switching fuels.\n\nIn this case, it looks very reasonable to expect $90 oil if OPEC+ doesn't aggressively hike - and why would they? On a side note, we're talking Brent oil $90. Right now, Brent is at $79, so please do not confuse it with WTI oil, which is at $75.7. Nonetheless, $90 Brent still means incredible upside for oil companies.\n\nMoreover, U.S. crude oil stocks are hovering close to their 5-year lows. I am not making the case for lows below 400 million barrels, but I do not expect oil to make it back to the average unless new lockdown measures are implemented.\n\n# So, why Marathon?\n\n**Marathon Is The Place To Be**\n\nSo, why Marathon? First of all, Marathon has a 50% crude oil, 50% NGL/gas revenue breakdown. Most of it is located in high-margin areas as the company sold its underperforming assets in recent years.\n\n>If you're new to Marathon Oil, you can basically think of it as a US-only oil play. The company does have some minor exposure overseas but used the past few years to sell its foreign assets to solely focus on high-margin U.S. projects. Over 90% of the company's Bakken and Eagle Ford operations are established in so-called high-quality areas which makes capital investments more rewarding. This is one of the reasons why the company is free cash flow breakeven (so, AFTER accounting for capital expenses) at less than $35 WTI. - *Article*\n\nThink about that for a second, Marathon Oil is breakeven at $35 WTI. This means that something truly terrible needs to happen in order for Marathon to enter a situation where it has to deal with a longer-term funding deficit. Even better, with rising oil prices, this means tons of free cash flow. On a side note, while I don't care for long-term capital gains in energy (I only want yield), we're in a truly remarkable situation as most energy companies can repair their balance sheet for the first time since 2014.\n\nFor example, Marathon oil is able to generate$8 billion in free cash flow at $60 WTI on a five-year basis. Right now, we're close to $80. This is based on a 40% reinvestment rate (capital expenditures). In 2021, analysts expect MRO to generate $2.0 billion in free cash flow, followed by another $2.0 billion in 2022. That's wild as the company did $460 million in 2018. In my prior article, expectations were below $1.4 billion. Please be aware that this is one of the reasons why oil is high in the first place. Upstream (companies who drill for oil) has found that ever-increasing production only hurts themselves. Why not focus on free cash flow generation instead? It also helps as it doesn't mess with OPEC members who were never happy to cut their own production to indirectly bail out their competitors in the U.S.\n\nRight now, Marathon Oil has an $11.2 billion market cap. This means that the company's expected free cash flow yield is 17.8%. In other words, unless the company pays a 17.8% dividend, we'll see both a high dividend and a massive improvement in balance sheet health.\n\nFor example, the company is expected to lower net debt from $4.7 billion at the end of 2020 to less than $1.5 billion in 2022. That would imply a less than 0.5x net leverage ratio. In such a scenario, even EBITDA comparable to the 2016 lows ($2.0 billion) would result in a net leverage ratio of less than 1.0x. If (and that's a big if) we were to encounter a long-term uptrend in oil, the company could easily turn net debt into net cash.\n\n**Almost needless to say, the valuation is still very attractive.**\n\nAuthor: Leo Nelisson\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Position:**\n\n* **\\*I am long on MRO in a straight share purchase** given that there will be volatility in the market over the next few months and the exact timing is difficult to predict.
