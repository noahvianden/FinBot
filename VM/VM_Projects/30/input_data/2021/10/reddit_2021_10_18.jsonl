{"title": "Trading the Opening Range Breakout (ORB) Strategy", "selftext": "I'm sure some of you have heard a little bit about the ORB Strategy whether that be through different online communities or educational content. This is a very simple, easy to use strategy that allows you to see when breakouts or breakdowns are happening on a specific stock. I am going to show you how the strategy works and how to use it as well as give you the studies to put on your ThinkorSwim charts, give you the scanners to scan for stocks that had a breakout or breakdown, and give you an easy to read column to add to your watchlist to see what stocks are breaking up or down. Let’s jump into it!\n\nHow It Works\n\nThere are several ways to trade this strategy but first let's talk real quick about how it works. The way the opening range strategy works is it takes the highest price of a stock within the first 30 minutes of the day and the low of the first 30 minutes of the day and draws lines for both. So let's breakdown a quick example. Say TSLA opens the day at $575, then within the first 30 minutes it has a high of $578 and a low of $571 within that first 30 minutes of the market being open. This strategy will draw a line at $578 and a line at $571 on your chart. Then you can play the chart multiple ways off of those lines, let’s take a look at the most common strategies.\n\nThe strategy will also create a grey box highlighting the first 30 minutes of the day. It will also draw a line at the \"midpoint\" or the middle of the opening range high and low.\n\nYou can check out the full article and other useful stock information here: [https://news.thebreadmaker.app](https://news.thebreadmaker.app)\n\nOpening Range Breakout\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7g451nbr3u71.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=075a5a20cb9e32c47f9cc98b6edac4ea93c9808e\n\nAs you can see from the chart above, all the lines and data are already drawn out for you. You can also see the stock break above the red line, that would ideally be your entry for a long or call position. You can then see the stock has a nice run-up after the breakout. This is the most common way to play the ORB strategy.\n\nOpening Range Breakdown\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hxdvppder3u71.jpg?width=1456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ed63f438cabaadb06d7d63139e46a86e541607e\n\nThe second most common is the Opening Range Breakdown, this is essentially the opposite of the breakout, you are watching for the stock to break the bottom ORB line and then you would enter a short or put position and as you can see the stock continues to dive lower.\n\nOpening Range - Support/Resistance\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ew0yaijgr3u71.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bbaabc83af1ab3e8ed52a04ef61b78a4db1a096\n\nThe final way to play this is as an intraday Support/Resistance channel. AIG chart above is a good example of that. You can see how the stock just traded a little sideways right on that bottom ORB and then bounced up off of it. You can play this the reverse way as well if the stock trades sideways up at the top of the ORB.\n\n***Important Tips:***\n\n* When playing this strategy make sure you are utilizing the 5 minute chart.\n* When using the breakout or breakdown strategy, DO NOT enter the trade until the 5 minute candle has closed above or below the top or bottom orb.\n\nScanners\n\nI will also provide a scanner that will scan for all the stocks that are above the top ORB as well as all the stocks that are below the bottom ORB. This is great because maybe you don't have a lot of stocks on your watchlist, well this will scan the whole market for stocks and pull all the ones that have a breakout or breakdown. The possibilities of finding a trade everyday are endless! This scanner always finds a bunch of stocks everyday for you to trade.\n\nHere are all the studies you can add to your ThinkorSwim platform to get started with trading the ORB strategy:\n\nOpening Range Breakout Chart Study:\n\n[**http://tos.mx/U3wNJQ**](http://tos.mx/U3wNJQ)\n\n**Opening Range Breakout(Above Top ORB) Scanner:**\n\n[**http://tos.mx/OfhG4K**](http://tos.mx/OfhG4K)\n\n**Opening Range Breakdown(Below Bottom ORB) Scanner:**\n\n[**http://tos.mx/yHriZl**](http://tos.mx/yHriZl)\n\nHopefully you find this information helpful and it makes trading easier for you.

{"title": "Golf is in full swing and $ELY is criminally undervalued.", "selftext": "\nIt’s golf season, bitches, and Callaway is poised to crush it. Throughout America on average a round of golf lasts about 3.5-4 hours. Times are up to 5 and even 6 hours, golf courses are jammed packed and Callaway is leading the way. While your wife is getting fucked by the pool cleaner chances are you haven’t even considered Callaway ($ELY) yet. Let’s get to some numbers. \n\nFirst, the institutional ownership stands at about 80% which means the people that are gang banging your wife when they’re not playing golf have a vested interest in $ELY. https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ely/institutional-holdings. \n\nSecond, Callaway has one of the best golf balls and clubs in the world, used in the PGA by some of the best golfers in the world. \n\nThird, Callaway recently acquired Top Golf and it’s not even priced in (rare event like you actually fucking your wife) \n\nFourth, before the two most important quarters for golf (Q3 & Q4) $ELY has been sliding due to macro events (inflation, stagflation, China implosion etc.) \n\nCallaway’s market cap sits at $5 billion with net sales at around $2 billion. Now here is the juicy part most of you cucks won’t understand because all your pre-evolutionary minds can comprehend is “squeeze”. $ELY paid $2.5 billion for Top Golf. Not only does the Top Golf acquisition set $ELY apart from its competitors, as its already one of the world leaders in golfing equipment, it gives it something your penis doesn’t like GROWTH and that’s very important here. What is the market valuing $ELY at? Almost dollar for dollar; $2 billion in 2020 net sales plus $2.5 billion for Top Golf puts $ELY at around the $4.5 billion range. Current market cap: $5 billion. $ELY’s valuation is criminal especially with people flooding golf courses around America and its big growth prospect in Top Golf. \n\n\n\nA report just came out that Americans savings are at an almost record breaking 33%, totaling $2.3 TRILLION dollars, Im currently watching my GF get rammed by a rando so I won’t link it but you can look it up. this is why the banks are crushing ERs left and right. Now that restrictions have lifted and people have lots of cash saved up the first thing people want to do is go out and enjoy some leisure activities, for a lot of people those activities include golfing.

Plug this catch phrase into Google and you’ll find hundreds of very vague “articles” of how, if you are lucky to catch that winner, you must let it ride, but barely anyone presents a real strategy of how that would be done properly, leaving novice investors diamond handing their stocks all the way up and all the way down again. Isn’t that a frustrating experience? Worst part is- this experience psychologically conditions the trader to pick up bad habits. After being caught out like that, it appears that the best thing to do is to grab that small profit market is giving you and get out till the next trade. Therefore the new trader is now conditioned to take small profits from numerous trades just to get caught in some random downtrend that wipes out all of the profits taken in months. That would mess with anyone’s psychology and more bad habits would follow… revenge trading, overtrading, picking risky and questionable investments, while to start with there was nothing wrong with the idea of holding your winners, it just had to become a real strategy with clear entry and exit points (more about it later) and strong reasoning of why the trade was entered to begin with. \n\nI’m going to explain why holding your winners works mathematically and can be one of the most lucrative strategies, how to pick your entries and plan exits and what type of set ups I’m personally looking for. I’m also going to outline the factors that should be considered a sign that this particular strategy should not be employed.\n\nLet me start from the mathematical aspect of this strategy. \nLet’s say that the trader bought 1000 shares of stock ABC, that is trading at $10. The stock is in the uptrend, moving up 2% a day for the next 10 days. Here is how daily profits on $10,000 capital would look like:\n\nDay 1 +$200       total profit $200\nDay 2 +$204       total profit $404\nDay 3 +$208       total profit $612\nDay 4 +$212        total profit $824\nDay 5 +$216        total profit $1040\nDay 6 +$220        total profit $1260\nDay 7 +$224        total profit $1484\nDay 8 +$230        total profit $1716\nDay 9 +$234        total profit $1950\nDay 10 +$240      total profit $2190\n\nAs you see from the first column the trader is benefiting from the power of combined interest. The longer the trader holds the same position the more profitable each move up is, even if the stock is moving consistently by the same percentage. For example a 2% move on day 10 actually benefited the trader 2.4% from his original investment. This becomes even more noticeable as time goes on. On day 30 the mare 2% move would cash the trader $320 for the day increasing his original position by 3.2%. \n\nWe have established that holding a stock through an uptrend becomes more and more profitable as time goes on. So what’s the problem? Well the problem seems to come from lack of planning and strategy and possibly conviction. \nBefore buying any stock, I put in days worth of research, watch the stock trade for adequate amount of time to start seeing its “personality”, scout public forums for other opinions and things I have possibly missed or information that other people stumbled upon. But my research doesn’t end there. Technical analysis is just as important. I go over every angle. I find my moving averages, support and resistance levels, go over daily volume and volume per price (that’s to indicate where previous bag holders will be tempted to close their positions) , find levels where the stock is likely to experience volatility explosion (usually levels with previous low volume per price) and note where short sellers will be tempted to enter. By the time I’m done with my research there is very little that can surprise me about the stock. I know all the upcoming catalysts. Would technical changes happen I would be ready to notice immediately. I ask myself questions like “is company likely to dilute its shareholders and when did last dilution happen?”, “what could be possible negative events?” and “what would change my conviction about the stock and company completely?”. \n\nOnce all of this research is done I don’t just blindly jump in. And it’s all so tempting! There are so many undervalued companies out there that fundamentally are amazing, yet charts or media sentiment are so ugly. Patience is the key. \nI wait for the stock to retest it’s long term support and confirm it. I start buying around that support level. Comfortably averaging in. This is not a day trade strategy, this is a swing trade strategy so I take my time to get comfortable in the position. It’s also very important not to overbet -even the strongest charts sometimes break and having extra capital can save your position in the unfortunate turn of events. But more about mitigating the risks later…. \n\nOnce I’m comfortable in my new position I already am aware of resistance levels but I don’t blindly sell at those levels, that’s where continuous technical analysis comes in. I watch daily volume as my most important indicator and combine that information with volume per price to come up with probability of stock continuing the up trend. High enough daily volume on the green side will most likely push the stock through levels where other investors are likely to exit. Higher positive volume is also a repellent for short sellers. Biggest and the most profitable moves can happen once the stock breaks upwards of previous resistance. Not only short sellers, that were in the wrong, will be closing their positions repurchasing the shares, but new ones will not enter until they are confident that an uptrend is over. \n\nSo knowing all this, where to take profits? \nI look for discrepancies that could possibly indicate that the chart is weakening. The key is to exit before a significant consolidation period. One of those signs is a large sell order in the order book that would be near impossible to fill with current volume. Others are: shrinking volume, lack of buy bids at lower levels in the order book, short term RSI is not resetting to oversold during fluctuations or general market condition is weakening. As long as I do not see any of these discrepancies, I believe that the position is better left alone to play out it’s full potential.  \nActively watching for discrepancies helps trader to take profits when chart is over extended. Waiting for the chart to break in an obvious way, such as falling back through moving averages, is also an option, especially if skills to look for discrepancies are not developed yet, but that would cost the trader some of his profits and psychologically is much harder to do. \n\nSince we have established an entry and exit points I’m going to quickly overview the type of setups I’m looking for. They don’t come around often, but can yield returns of 30%-200% within weeks. Latest examples of stocks, that I have personally traded, and achieved those results are BNGO, RKT, CLOV and SPCE. I believe that in the matter of weeks I’ll be able to add RIOT to that list, but the future is never certain. \nMy main criteria while looking for this type of trade is finding companies with extreme fundamental changes, that is unnoticed or unacknowledged by the market. For medical companies it would be an important drug or equipment approval, for others -expanding contracts, expansion to new markets, or becoming profitable due to unexpected immediate growth. It also could be the loss of competition (right now it is the case of American based miners, due to China’s restrictions on miners). If the stock is undervalued without counting in the fundamental changes- it’s an added bonus!The best part about relying on fundamentals and research is -low risk for a loss. Even if the trader makes technical analysis mistake or gets stuck in an unexpected downtrend the stocks tend to come back to their fundamental value. With this strategy, having a little bit of patience, there is little reason to cut losses (contrary to a popular saying), unless of course there are major negative catalysts or new fundamental flaw. \nOn the other hand it is wise to have extra capital, in case the trade doesn’t play out right away, and seas any opportunity to grab shares at a greater discount. Averaging down is a powerful risk mitigation tool, if used in the correct way. After establishing a comfortable position, I would not suggest to start averaging down any sooner than after experiencing at least a 20% loss, and only if fundamentals still stand (this percentage is applied to volatile mid-cap trades). Averaging down too soon takes away the trader’s edge and in most cases contributes to a greater loss initially. \nOnce I find these stocks with huge fundamental changes I make sure to mark up all the upcoming catalysts (that’s what will kick off the trade and will allow the market to notice our company). For example earnings could be an amazing catalyst because analyst coverage comes soon after. \n\nWe have overviewed our entry and exit points, type of stocks we are looking for, but what about the negative factors to watch out for? \n \n\nWell why don’t we come up with that together?", "id": "qao0va", "created_utc": 1634568054.0, "score": 117, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "Not a bad write-up, but the \"compounding interest\" example for stocks is a real pet peeve of mine.

{"title": "Netflix Q3 Earnings Estimate", "selftext": "There is currently a lot of talk and hype around Netflix after their blockbuster release of “Squid Games”. Squid Games has quickly become an international sensation after reaching 111M+ global viewers in more than 200 different countries. Squid games has brought a lot of hype to Netflix (and their original content) and has set the stage for an interesting Q3 2021 earnings report for their stock investors. Today, I am here to predict how Netflix’s Q3 earnings report will go, and a large part of this will be focusing on the growth of their platform in the past quarter due to their hit show “Squid Games”. At the end of this analysis, you will find a [NFLX price target](https://utradea.com/positions/NetFlix-Earnings-Prediction-), and how I would play this earnings if my figures are correct.\n\n**Squid Games:**\n\nFirstly, as we know, Squid Games had reached over 111M global users in over 200 countries in the past month alone. This in and of itself is impressive, however factoring in their low production cost of $21.4M makes it exponentially more impressive. Squid Games was able to keep these costs low due to filming in South Korea (Internationally) which allows for actors to work longer hours and can bring the cost of production down. Top executives have predicted that the cost to shoot domestically (in Hollywood) would have been 5-10x more than Netflix’s cost of production. This series in particular has opened the floodgates for streaming services to shoot internationally, as many of them are now starting to express interest in it.\n\nSquid Games was a huge money maker for Netflix and has been estimated to be worth in the ballpark of $900M, which represents a return on their investment (production) of over 4,100%. Considering Netflix’s revenues last quarter were $7.3B, Squid Games is likely to represent a large percentage of their revenues in Q3, and since their margins are so impressive, it is likely that we see Squid Games have a role to play in Netflix having better margins on their upcoming earnings.\n\n**Q2 2021 Earnings Report:**\n\nThe most important factor that I derived from Netflix’s Q2 2021 financial report is the fact that their weighted average subscription price across all of their regions is $12.26. This will be very important in determining the revenues in Q3 2021.\n\nFurthermore, Netflix’s revenues in Q2 2021 were $7.34B, and their cost of revenues was $4.02B (54.73% of revenues).\n\n***Q3 2021 Earnings Estimate:***\n\n*Revenues:*\n\nI am basing Netflix’s revenues off of their previous revenues, plus the new revenues that are brought in by additional subscribers in this quarter. \n\nFirstly, to get the new subscriber figures I decided to take Netflix’s estimate of 3.5M in this quarter for the first 3 months, due to squid games not being added. This resulted in 900k new subscribers per month for the first 3 months, which adds up to 2.7M new subscribers in June, July, and August.\n\nLastly, we needed the new subscribers for the month of September. This was more difficult to calculate as they released Squid Games this month which drove in far more traffic than usual. In order to get a proxy for how many new subscribers a “hit” like Squid Games can bring in, I used the data from Netflix’s 2nd biggest show “Bridgerton.” Like Squid Games, Bridgerton was released 1 month prior to their earnings report, and helped Netflix to beat their new subscriber estimates by 41%. However, since squid games is 50% more popular than Bridgerton was in their first month, I think it is reasonable to estimate that Squid Games can help Netflix beat their Q3 2021 new subscriber estimates by 61.5%. Increasing Netflix’s Q3 subscriber figures yield 5.65M new subscribers over the whole quarter. This means that in September, Netflix likely brought in 2.95M new subscribers mostly off of the success of Squid Games.\n\nOverall, if Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers June, their revenue generated for the quarter would be $44.32M (900000\\*$12.26\\*4 months). If Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers in July, their revenues generated for the quarter would be $33.1M (900,000\\*$12.26\\*4 months). If Netflix brought in 0.9M subscribers in August, their revenues for the quarter would be $22.07M (900,000\\*$12.26\\*2 months). Lastly, if Netflix brought in 2.95M subscribers in September as a result of Squid Games, their quarterly revenues would be $36.16M. \n\nIn total, it is reasonable to assume Netflix increased their revenues by $136.22M, bringing their Q3 revenues to $7.48B. However, Netflix has been reported to have increased their prices by $1 in many regions. To be conservative, we can assume a $0.50 increase across all regions, which would result in a 4% increase on average prices. This would then cause Netflix’s quarterly revenues to be 4% higher, totalling $7.78B. This would represent earnings beat of 0.28B (or 3.7%).\n\n*Cost of Revenues:*\n\nAs previously mentioned, Squid Games is very likely to have increased Netflix’s margins. As a result of this we can conservatively estimate that Netflix’s cost of revenues is 54% of their revenues (as opposed to 54.73% in Q2 2021). By doing this their cost of revenues should be $4.2B\n\n*Other Costs:*\n\nAssuming that Netflix’s other costs are the same % of revenues as they were in the previous quarter, we can estimate all of these other expenses to total $1.56B.\n\n*Operating Income:*\n\nIf these assumptions are correct, then Netflix’s operating income for Q3 2021 should be $2.01B.\n\n*Net Income:*\n\nAssuming Netflix’s Net Income to Operating Income ratio is the same (over the past 6 months), we can estimate that Netflix’s Q3 Net Income figure to be $1.25B.\n\n*EPS:*\n\nSince Netflix has 442.6M shares outstanding, their diluted EPS should be $2.74. This would represent a 7% EPS\n\n**Overall Thoughts:**\n\nI think that Netflix is going to narrowly beat earnings, which in theory should be good for the stock. However, since Squid Games was released, the stock has been up 6-7%. As a result, I think that NFLX will not have a big reaction from their earnings. I think that they might open the next trading day (October 20th) up between 0-1% and close the day between -0.5% and +0.5%. \n\nIf I am correct, then the best way that I could think to play this via iron condors. I think that a 600/615/635/650 iron condor would be suitable given [my estimates](https://utradea.com/positions/NetFlix-Earnings-Prediction-). Buying this option would cost $375 which is the maximum downside, and the max profit is $1,125, which represents a 3:1 risk to reward ratio which is good. Furthermore, the probability of profit (based on recent volatility) is 61%. Furthermore, the breakeven prices are $603 and $646. The breakeven price represents my post-earnings price target; however I think that Netflix will stay within the inner range of $615-635, which would yield a credit of $1,125.", "id": "qaoh16", "created_utc": 1634569386.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "you've convinced me to avoid playing netflix earnings. thank you.", "score": 24, "replies": []}, {"body": "Literally nothing matters but their subscriber numbers.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Netflix is collaborating with retarded Youtubers to get views & hits on youtube in my country & that's cringe", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "So... buy puts?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "In my article I mentioned an Iron Condor, which is a neutral strategy where you make money between the spread of the breakeven", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Sounds complicated and I need to stay away from it lol", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "My issue is that this all hinges on an imaginary value attributed to the show by NFLX.
