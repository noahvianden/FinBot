{"title": "Walmart Thesis Statement (04/07/21)", "selftext": "Did my own personal DD on a few companies and WMT stood out.  Thought I would share it here.  Not really looking for comment or criticism just sharing my own findings.  I've been writing my own thesis statements for investments > $10,000 for the last few years.  My last successful venture was $DIS and I also shared my thesis statement here around two years ago.  Full disclosure, I've purchased 80 shares as of this morning.  Writeup was completed as of 04/07/21 and I will send my analyses via excel to anyone interested.\n\n**Walmart Thesis Statement:**\n\nWalmart Corp. is growing its eCommerce presence and maintains a dominant position in the retail industry. Walmart is able to differentiate from its competitors due to the niche market of affordable products in a brick and mortar format that is augmented by its growing online presence. Walmart maintains the highest revenue amongst its competitors (listed below) and is currently relatively undervalued due to short-term financial statements which show a negative net income growth which can be directly attributed to investments in online growth. Assuming a rational market, Walmart is undervalued relative to its direct competitors. It maintains its market capitalization as a retail corporation which will reap the benefits of a growing online economy.  In this paper, a justification for a Market Capitalization of $500B will be made with supporting fundamental and competitor analyses.\n\n**Background Information:**\n\nPrice as of Wednesday, 04/07/21: $140.16\n\nDirect Competitors: Amazon, Target, Costco, Kmart, Kroger, ALDI, Walgreens, Tesco, Carrefour, Best Buy\n\nMarket Capitalization: $394.78B\n\nP/E Ratio: 29.53 (Growth Mode)\n\nDiv. Yield: 1.57%\n\n52-wk high: $153.66 (9.63% Upside) approx. December 1st 2020\n\n**Benefits:**\n\nAs of Wednesday, 04/07, Walmart is the lowest risk retail conglomerate and is priced at a multiple less than its direct competitors including Target and Walmart. Walmart is currently in the midst of a transition to eCommerce which has not yet been sufficiently reflected in its Market Capitalization.\n\n**Competitor Analysis:**\n\n[**https://imgur.com/a/XBizaMp**](https://imgur.com/a/XBizaMp)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA conservative P/E ratio of 40 would bring Walmart in line with its three top competitors. This computes a 36% P/E ratio increase. This P/E would result in an increased EPS of $9.87/share; in line with Costco and slightly higher than Target. Adjusted Market Capitalization to offset this P/E increase can conservatively be estimated at 25%. A fair valuation for Walmart can then be computed at a Market Capitalization of $500B. Translated to cost per share, a sell price of $176.93 can be computed.\n\n**Debrief:**\n\nIn the coming year, the most important metrics to watch in Walmart‚Äôs financial statements will continue to be Revenue, and P/E Ratio. Also important is Walmart‚Äôs net income which will be the star of the show as a turnaround in this financial datum will likely result in an increased price per share.", "id": "mqzmof", "created_utc": 1618433140.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "This is what I want to see more of.

One question does your thesis consider market share? Because it looks like your thesis is based on the fact that walmart will gain more market share from the competition. Am I understanding your thesis correctly? Because in my mind, for one company to be in line fundamentally with its competitors they would have to gain more market share from them. Or at least increase their footprint in  the sector with a new business model. Please correct my view on this.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Hi.  Yes, in fact my thesis statement is based on the premise that Walmart currently has a majority of retail market share and is strategically placed to build on that market share via eCommerce.  There's a lot you're missing and it may be better to address it via a PM but in essence, fundamentals in market analysis refer to looking at financial statements and drawing conclusions from data such as multiples and financial ratios.  \n\nThe theory is that companies in the same industry should share similar financial metrics.  This becomes increasingly difficult in a blended market where companies such as Amazon are doing more than one thing so their multiples result in outliers from the norm.    \n\nMaybe I can address u/7loUge and u/Stock_Resolution7866 here as well.  P/E is simply the price per share over earnings per share.  Typically, or so I was taught, a P/E under 15 is indicative of a value stock whereas a P/E greater than 15 is a growth stock.  Has Walmart ever been at a P/E of 40?  Of course not.  But then again, Walmart has never been considered an eCommerce retailer until very recently.  There's certainly a paradigm shift in HOW Walmart does things not so much what they do.  To say that 40 is not viable long-term is to also say that a P/E of 70+ for Amazon is irrational.  Whether it is or is not doesn't matter in this analysis.  The bottom line is that in a fair market, WMT is undervalued.  \n\nKey takeaway:  Walmart doesn't have to grow their business through eCommerce (though they will) to increase their Market Cap. there are scores of ways they can do this.  One such way is if they maintain market foothold while decreasing operating costs through eCommerce.  I do not believe a P/E of 40 is irrational whatsoever.  Sometimes people look too closely at a stock and forget the only thing that matters.  Market Capitalization.  WMT is a $400B company and Amazon is at $2T (? fact chk.).  Yet Walmart has a much larger share of retail and more distribution channels.  Now obviously its much more complicated than that.  But to say WMT can't reach $500B market cap. which, all things being equal, directly translates to a P/E of 40, is false.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Ty for the explanation. But don't get me wrong, I am very thankful üôè for your insight and I'm very bullish on WMT. In fact I recently bought in after they announced their fintech startup business.

He has not so good approval rating and when I went through his track record, he is more of a broadening business type guy. But WMT should focus its efforts in efficiency now more than ever imo. WMT is losing its footprint in Asia due to high cost of operations. Also for fintech business model I went in because I thought it would give them more efficiency not because they are broadening their footprint in e-commerce.(Also that part of fintech is already populated by companies like Square and Stripe.
