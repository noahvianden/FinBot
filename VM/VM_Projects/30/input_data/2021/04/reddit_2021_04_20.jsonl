But with the rise of these huge mining stocks, other mining stocks with small market cap can‚Äôt be overlooked.  \nOver the past few years, I have managed to make some good gains with these so-called small mining stocks through growth catalysts. Up to date, this is what I‚Äôm bullish on:  \n[$STHC](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/sthc/) \\- Southcorp Capital Inc\n\n* Had a huge reverse merger with Ameca Mining/Group looming. Awaiting 43-101 report (delayed due to Covid travel restrictions) to validate findings in eastern Sri Lanka prior to finalizing reverse merger. $4.4 billion in high grade graphite being the biggest finding. Off take agreements already setup. Graphite demand exploding with EV battery market‚Äôs exponential growth. Ground level entry here under $30 million market cap.  \n\n\n[$LODE](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comstock-releases-shareholder-letter-embarks-104500170.html) \\- Comstock Mining Inc\n\n* Was a bit frustrated when Spruce Point tried to short them forcing me to sell 50% of my holdings but probably we‚Äôll see the stock rise again with the revival of Green shift.\n\n[$SLSSF](https://www.solarisresources.com/news/press-releases/solaris-reports-922m-of-0-point-94-percent-cueq-from-surface-in-continued-expansion-of-warintza-central) \\- Solaris Resources Inc  \n   This one is interesting;\n\n* In order to expand its shareholders‚Äô investment opportunities, $SLSSF has recently begun exploiting new mining fields, the latest being [Warintza ](https://www.solarisresources.com/projects/warintza/)project in South-eastern Ecuador, thus making solaris an acquisition opportunity. \n* The reason why I‚Äôm bullish about this company is because I have been able to consistently gain from their stock since 2018 though, in the past 5 days it has dipped by a margin of 2.65%. \n* Moreover, this acquisition has significantly been de-risked by being fully funded and availability of drilling resources.\n* Also, a report from the [geophysical](https://www.solarisresources.com/projects/warintza/) investigation shows that  the copper in the ground is worth four or five billion and the market cap is only 1 billion.\n* It is $25 to $30 Rio Tinto or BHP stock on sale for $9.25 today.

{"title": "Credit Suisse (CS) Investors Are Overreacting to Greensill and Archegos", "selftext": "Disclaimer: If you‚Äôre here for rocket emojis and short squeezes, move along. I‚Äôm not going to be offering any certainty here, nor am I going to tell you exactly how to play CS. That said, if you‚Äôre going to stick around, I hope you enjoy!\n\nTo understand what‚Äôs going on with Credit Suisse right now, we have to first discuss two major events that happened in the financial world since the last quarterly report: The collapse of Greensill and Archegos.\n\nGreensill Capital was a supply chain financial services company that made money in three ways:\n\n* Reverse factoring^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_finance)\n* Factoring^[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factoring_\\(finance\\))\n* Future accounts receivables finance^[3](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accountsreceivablefinancing.asp)\n\nFuture accounts receivables finance tends to be especially risky since the lender is essentially issuing a loan to the lendee against collateral that the lendee has been promised from another party but has not yet received. However, Greensill may have actually taken this one step further and issued loans with collateral being money the lendee was predicted to be promised but had not yet actually been promised.\n\nIn July of 2020, one of Greensill‚Äôs insurers, Tokio Marine, discovered that a Tokio Marine employee had broken internal risk management limits in some way while insuring Greensill Capital (I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs directly related to the aggressive future accounts receivables financing practices, but I don‚Äôt have any evidence or sources to back this up). In response, Tokio Marine ceased insuring Greensill, leaving $4.8 billion of working capital uninsured. Greensill attempted to get an extension of coverage but failed and was forced to look for a new insurer. The problem was that no one wanted to insure them. On March 1st, 2021, after eight months of having billions of uninsured working capital and even more default insurance that expired over that previous weekend, Credit Suisse began freezing supply-chain investment funds in Greensill. That very same day, Greensill began filing for insolvency, and insolvency protection was granted on the 8th of March. I‚Äôll skip the boring stuff, but Credit Suisse‚Äôs loss is estimated to be roughly $3 billion. I don‚Äôt know exactly how much of that is going to hit CS directly vs. their clients, but needless to say, it won‚Äôt be pretty either way.\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk about Archegos.\n\nArchegos was a family office that imploded in March of 2021. In order to understand what happened, you need to first understand what a Total Return Swap is.^[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_return_swap) Essentially (and this is simplified), a TRS allows you to ask the bank to hold a stock for you and pay you any appreciation or dividends, and you pay them a fixed (or sometimes variable) rate in return. This allows you to benefit from a share of a stock as if you held it yourself, but without having to actually own it. Because you don‚Äôt own the stock yourself with a TRS, Archegos was able to get a metric fuckton of loans without reporting their ViacomCBS (VIAC) and Discovery (DISCA) positions, thereby deceiving the loaners as to just how exposed and heavily leveraged they were on highly volatile positions.^[5](https://youtu.be/58Sx26Gt6H8) They did this for several major banks, namely Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Nomura Holdings. Archegos was margin-called due to a large, synchronized ~27% drop in both VIAC and DISCA. Several large banks began liquidating Archegos‚Äôs TRS positions at roughly the same time in response (remember, the banks held these stocks, not Archegos themselves). This resulted in an additional 27% drop. Certain banks were able to get out faster than others, but CS and Nomura were especially slow to act.\n\nSo, what was the result of all of this? All-in-all, Archegos is expected to cost Credit Suisse somewhere in the ballpark of $4.7 billion.^[6](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/trading-update-202104.html) That figure is not expected to increase meaningfully as new information comes out.^[7](https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-question-credit-suisse-over-recent-archegos-related-stock-sales-11618934842) This $4.7 billion is in addition to the $3 billion loss from Greensill, bringing the final loss for Credit Suisse to somewhere in the ballpark of $7.7 billion in a single quarter. This is 95% of CS's total operating income (profit) for the past three years.\n\nSo, with all of these big, scary numbers, why am I still bullish?\n\nSimply put, their balance sheet doesn‚Äôt justify the hit Credit Suisse‚Äôs stock took. CS had $805.8 billion in assets, $139.1 billion (17.3%) of that in cash alone as of December 31st, 2020.^[8](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/balance-sheet?p=CS) A $7.7 billion loss is only 0.95% of assets and 5.5% of cash ‚Äì they could eat this loss almost 18 times and wouldn‚Äôt have to liquidate a single non-cash asset. The loss as compared to equity ($65.3 billion) is significantly bigger, constituting an 11.7% hit after subtracting liabilities. However, this, in my opinion, does not justify the ~30% hit the stock has taken.^[9](https://i.imgur.com/QZmciLp.png) To build on this, their price to book ratio was 0.56 as of five days ago^[10](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CS/key-statistics?p=CS), which also indicates CS is a strong value investment, Book value is sitting at $17.74 but the current price is only $10.30, meaning there is at least 72% upside, although that is probably unrealistic in the short and medium terms.\n\nAs if this wasn‚Äôt enough, Credit Suisse has been in business since 1856, and it will take a lot more than a $7.7 billion loss to bring a financial giant like this to its knees. In fact, they are even named as one of the Systemically Important Financial Institutions (SIFI),^[11](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_131111.pdf) They are, quite literally (and by definition), too big to fail. The responsible executives have also been removed^[12](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us-news/en/articles/media-releases/changes-in-the-exb-credit-suisse-ch-202104.html) which shows they are going to be taking their risk management far more seriously in the future. Loss prevention on this scale will probably not happen again for some time because this loss is going to be at the forefront of their minds for a while.\n\nHow can this play go wrong then? Well, in the long-term, I‚Äôm fairly confident I‚Äôm right and that the market is overreacting to Greensill and Archegos. It did wipe about three years of profit from the balance sheet, but financially, the company is in a pretty solid place regardless. The more important variable is how it affected client trust, which will be difficult to gauge. I think there are fundamentally too many positive forces holding CS up to allow it to fall, but the current price reflects an overly bearish scenario. People are comparing Archegos to Longterm Capital Management when that is simply not the case. LTCM ended up leveraging themselves to the tune of $1.25 trillion while Archegos lost somewhere in the ballpark of $10-$20 billion with VIAC and DISCA. That said, CS certainly has the opportunity to go south in the short term. CS reports Q1 results on April 22nd, two days from now^[13](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/events/calendar.html) and, especially considering the market‚Äôs behavior over the past several days, I think it‚Äôs possible that investors will panic after listening to the earnings call. They may overestimate the damage, sell in fear, and cause the stock to drop even further. The reality is that this bank is not going anywhere. CS is going to be around in 5-10 years no matter what, yet the current pricing feels like investors expect doomsday on April 22nd. The second scenario is that the earnings call inspires confidence, although I personally this is less likely due to the fact that this did wipe out three years of profit. In this scenario, the best-case scenario I can realistically see happening is CS trading sideways, since some people are going to sell anyway. If it does dip, I‚Äôm hoping to pick up as many of those shares as possible.\n\nI want to be clear that I still very much have questions about how the fine details are going to work when it comes to the loss‚Äôs interaction with Credit Suisse‚Äôs balance sheet. I am not quite sure what amount of the damage is going to hit CS‚Äôs clients vs. falling directly on Credit Suisse. The answer to that question is very relevant, yet I have not been able to find a clear answer. I also do not know for sure what the post-earnings reaction will be. My guess is just that: a guess. Also, if I‚Äôm missing or misanalyzing this, please do call me out as I genuinely want this to be the highest quality DD possible. Thanks for reading to the end!\n\nEdit: I'm aware GS and MS destroyed CS here - hell, I spent the past week reading about it. I believe in the American banks for more, I just think CS stock is pricing in a hellfire scenario.\n\nEdit 2: The Q1 report has gone live and can be found [here](https://www.credit-suisse.com/about-us/en/reports-research/quarterly-interim-reports/quarterly-results.html). I wasn't too surprised with most of the presentation, although I would definitely have liked to see less use of \"adjusted\" and \"excluding significant items\" in the financial reports. I do stand by my long-term thesis that CS's present valuation is excessively bearish, as well as my short-term thesis that the stock will likely not do too well in the coming months. I also want to clarify that this post was not trying to convince people that these two events weren't big deals - I did a fuckton of research on it for a week straight, I know it's a big deal. I think people were interpreting my post as optimistic for the short term when that is absolutely not the case. **I do not believe CS is going to do well in the short term.** When I say long-term, I mean long-term.
