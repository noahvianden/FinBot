Options are like ternary instruments, they allow one to profit if the underlying goes up, down, or sideways. Best way to get started is to learn what a put and a call are. Then move onto basic positions. The best approach I can recommend is to pickup a beginners book. I read [this](http://www.amazon.com/Options-Beginner-Beyond-Opportunities-Minimize/dp/0132655683/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1382484663&sr=8-1&keywords=options) - the first version - which taught me the ropes quickly. I also picked up several other books afterwards that got into the subject on a deeper and more technical level. One of the most fascinating things I've learned so far is what implied volatility is. See [another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1l76vw/option_trading/cbwkok9). With IV you can work out statistically the chances of a trade profiting. Like someone else mentioned, www.tastytrade.com, a free streaming live options talk show, is based on statistical trading and not trading on fear/hope.\n\n  Traditionally, iron condors are traded with index ETF options such as the SPY or IWM. There's obviously less risk of a massive move in a short amount of time. Though black swans do exist, see 2008, euro crisis, debt ceiling, etc. If the s&p or the russel stays in your IC's range until it expires, you win. You profit on theta decay this way. Since ICs are short volatility, there was a huge drop in NFLX implied vol today -went from 70sh to 50sh. That 20 some odd point drop in IV alone amounted to over 50% of $4800. The rest was from theta decay and delta.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "So can you do an IC without actually having the liquid assets to cover the loss?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Absolutely. That's where the long options come in. If the short options are exercised against me, I exercise my long options. No need to actually own the stock. But you can if you really want to. One option contact covers 100 shares. 50 contracts covers 5000 shares. 5000 shares of nflx costs  quite a lot more than simply going long options to cover your short options.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> simply going long options to cover your short options.\n\nWhat does this mean?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Buying one call contract gives you the \"option\" to CALL 100 shares of underlying INTO your account at the option's strike price, you pay $\"strike price\" per share. Buying a put contract gives you the \"option\" to PUT 100 shares you own into someone's account, making them buy the shares from you at the put options strike price. \n\nSay you sell one GOOG 1050 call that expires months from now. GOOG is currently at $1007. You'll get a credit. If GOOG rises to say 1080 within a few days, your short 1050 call could be exercised. It WILL automatically be exercised ON its expiration date months from now if it's above 1050. If it is, you're on the hook to provide 100 shares of GOOG to the person who bought your call, they in turn will give you $1050 per share. \n\nHowever you get the shares, if you had them to begin with or if you have to buy them at current market value, $1080, you'll need to come up with them no matter what. \n\nThe best way to protect yourself is to buy a call, say a 1055 GOOG call, that way you can exercise it when GOOG is at 1080, pay $1055 per share, then give the shares to the other guy. Loosing $5 x 100 in the process.\n\nSelling a 1050 call and buying a 1055 call at the same time obviously leaves you with a credit, much smaller than the credit you would receive if you had only sold the call. It's actually a percentage of the max loss, could be 10 to 40% (avg) and this is where IV comes in. Higher IV, higher options prices. But if GOOG stays around 1000 for the next few months, you will get to keep that small credit.

There's actually a ton I could explain about options but: 1. it would take me forever and 2. someone out there could explain much better than I can.\n\nI can narrow it down to this strategy, which is selling an Iron Condor.
