I've seen this mentioned on blogs and other reddit posts.\n\nDoes the price of a stock effect your stock pick? \n\nI've heard some people say that they won't trade Google or Apple because their stock prices are $800 and $400 a share, and so they will stick to stocks that are under $100/share.  Something along those lines.\n\nI don't understand the difference.  Holding 10 shares of a $100 stock is the same holding as 100 shares of a $10 stock. Through my broker, I still get charged a flat fee for trading either 10 shares or 100 shares... it makes no difference.\n\nAm I missing something here?", "id": "1dem8c", "created_utc": 1367323706.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "There is no difference.
