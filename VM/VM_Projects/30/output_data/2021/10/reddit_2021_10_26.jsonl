{"title": "At what point does valuation matter?", "selftext": "I'm hoping to generate some quality discussion on this topic because it's something I've been struggling with in my own mind.\n\nOn the one hand, I keep hearing experts say things like, \"Valuation doesn't matter if the company is growing strongly,\" and, \"Every high growth company was considered expensive along the way.\" Their advice is to basically ignore metrics like P/S if you like everything else about the stock.\n\nOn the other hand, the data doesn't seem to support this. I posted a thread about a week ago that referenced a study showing that over the long term, stocks with higher sales multiples underperform stocks with lower sales multiples. I also did my own study where I looked at the best performing stocks of the past decade and discovered that none of them ever had P/S ratios over 25 or so, and the few that did only had those multiples for a very brief time. There are also plenty of examples of stocks that were richly valued not long ago and have sold off 40%+.\n\nSo I'm having difficulty reconciling these two ideas. While there are examples of stocks that keep going up despite high valuations, there are also lots of examples of stocks that are counter-examples to the \"valuation doesn't matter\" rule. It seems that valuation doesn't matter until it does, and then it really matters.\n\nI wonder if the issue is how different people are defining \"expensive.\" Everybody uses TSLA as the prime example of an expensive stock because it trades at a ridiculous P/E, but it trades at a P/S of 24 which I don't consider expensive at all. (It is if you value it as a car company relative to other car companies, but certainly not if you value it as a tech company). There's a huge difference between a P/S of 20 and 40 or 60 (or 100, in the case of NET).\n\nTheoretically, valuation should matter because it reflects that investors are pricing in a certain growth rate and the higher the valuation, the more difficult it will be for a company to sustain the growth rate necessary to justify the valuation. That's why we see some previously very popular growth stocks down 50% from their highs after disappointing earnings.\n\nSo the question is, at what point does valuation matter?", "id": "qg7sgm", "created_utc": 1635259024.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "You don't consider a P/S of 24 \"expensive at all?\" holy shit dude", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Its stuff like that people say that convinces me then ever that we are in a bubble.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["bubble"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "That's kind of the point of the post, what counts as \"expensive\" and when is a stock too expensive to buy.\n\nHave you never purchased a stock with a P/S over 20?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "No absolutely not lol.

As a matter of fact, valuation always matters if you actually plan to have meaningful returns in the long run. A P/E of 24 is actually very high by any standards other than today's and you are basing your thinking on today's numbers thinking it is worth it to overpay for stocks because \"everything is overpriced these days\". Long story short, it is not and you will be one of many to regret in the future if you don't broaden up your horizon. \n\nA P/E of 24 means you pay $24 for $1 of earnings.
