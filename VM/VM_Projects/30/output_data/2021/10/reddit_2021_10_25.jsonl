{"title": "The Weekly DD - Upstart (UPST) Full Stock Analysis: A potential FAANG?", "selftext": "# UPST at a glance\n\nUPST is a risk management company specialized in loans and financing. Their core product is a machine learning model which calculates risk which they tout as being more effective than traditional credit risk scores such as FICO. In an internal (biased to some degree) study, replicating the business models of three traditional banks, UPST was able to show 75% lower default rates and 173% more approvals at the same loss rate. With this core product, UPST is able to offer three services:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Personal loans: UPST offers personal loans automatically through their online platform. Anyone can apply for a loan and get automatic approval/denial. Over two-thirds of their loans are approved automatically without any need for human intervention.\n* Risk management score: UPST offers banks the ability to use their machine learning algorithm to perform credit worthiness assessments to either supplant or usurp FICO scores. Their lending program, when compared to traditional banks, approve 26% more borrowers and yields 10% lower average APRs for approve loans.\n* Auto dealership loans: With the acquisition of Prodigy, UPST offers automobile dealers the ability to really quickly offer financing options to their clients. With UPST, dealers are able to save on average 90 minutes per deal as well as achieve higher PVRs (gross income per vehicle retailed) of up to 59%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The lending industry\n\n**Personal loans**\n\nPersonal loans are individually requested loans for such things as paying off credit cards, starting a new business, refinancing vehicles, or paying off large expenses. The global personal loan market was estimated to be $47B in 2020 but to grow to $719B by 2030 with a CAGR of 31.7%. While the personal loan market slowed down during the COVID pandemic, it is expected to pick back up as the effects of COVID go away. This massive growth rate is driven in a large part by lower interest rates and higher borrowing limits especially within developing countries. In 2020, nearly 12% of all USA consumers had a personal loan and the median personal loan amount per family has more than doubled since the 1990s. As of 2021, commercial banks had given out $1.5T in consumer loans in the United States alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Auto loans**\n\nAuto loans are loans requested either by an individual or by a dealership for financing automobile purchases. The global automobile loan market was estimated to be $245B in 2020 and expected to grow to $394B in 2028 with a CAGR of 7.1%. This is driven primarily by a couple of factors. The demand for vehicles is growing in both developed and developing countries while access to finance has grown as well. Within the US, the average auto loan amount has reached a record high of $32K while volume has also reached an all time high with over 85% of new cars sold being financed through an auto loan. Auto loans are the third highest source of debt within families behind mortgages and student debts. Within the previous decade, auto loans has grown by over 80%!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Consumer credit reporting**\n\nCredit bureaus and rating agencies are responsible for providing data and scores about an individual\u2019s ability to repay loans. In 2021, the revenues of this industry increased 4.1% to $12.7B with the four largest firms accounting for 60% of this revenue. This market is expected grow to $14.2B by 2024 with a CAGR of 4.3%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The financials\n\n**Income statement**\n\nUPST\u2019s income statement follows the mold for a fast-growing company. Their revenues have nearly doubled every year with 2021 being no exception. This growth comes from their \u201cnon-interest income\u201d which points to the fact that their personal lending program is not growing at the same rate as their risk management score program. In fact, within their own presentations, they talk about how 97% of their revenues take upon no risk as they are simply providing a risk score to banks, getting revenue from that service, and not necessarily offering loans themselves. This points to their primary focus being on expanding their credit risk machine learning model service rather than their own personal lending program.\n\nTheir selling and marketing costs have also increased same as their revenues, but it is increasing at a slower rate which is nice to see.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Balance sheet**\n\nUPST has a healthy balance sheet with $320M of cash equivalent assets and only $40M of current debts. The only significant callout on their balance sheet is that their total assets and liabilities have drastically decreased since 2018. You can see that in 2018 and 2019, they actually had more liabilities than assets which they have been able to pare down since then. So, while UPST has a healthy balance sheet, this is a more recent development and most likely largely due to the injection of cash and other assets they received through their IPO.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Statement of cash flows**\n\nUPST has a phenomenal statement of cash flows. Their operating cash flow has really picked up this year as well as their financing cash flow, which makes sense given their IPO (much of which was realized in 2021 rather than 2020). In general, they are building increasing cash positions through the years while reducing their cash loss from other activities. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Where UPST stands\n\n**The bull case**\n\nUPST is trying to disrupt FICO scores which are used by 90% of the US\u2019s top lenders and they have a good case for doing so. As mentioned previously, their lending program, when compared to traditional banks, approve 26% more borrowers and yields 10% lower average APRs for approve loans. Furthermore, they have found themselves a sweet spot with near-prime consumers (consumers with a FICO score between 620 and 660) where their model approves 95% more consumers while reducing interest rates by 5.4% compared to traditional models. They are able to achieve all this while reducing failure rates on those loans. With this model, UPST and the banks they partner with are able to offer more competitive loan packages to more people, granting a broader population access to credit while reducing their overall risk profile. This combined with an already rapidly expanding personal loan market and UPST is in a good position for future growth.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The bear case**\n\nWhile UPST is certainly a growing company, their $27B valuation is extended. To put that in perspective, Transunion, one of the largest credit bureaus in the US has a valuation of $22B. Transunion has a 2020 revenue of $2.7B while UPST has a 2020 revenue of $227M. While UPST is growing much more rapidly than Transunion, it still has an absurd valuation in comparison. Proponents of UPST argue that they have various business models to generate revenue, but 97% of their revenues come from fees from banks or services with no credit exposure. This means that while technically they do more than credit reporting, that \u201cother\u201d accounts for 3% of their revenues. Furthermore, 60% of their revenues comes from a single entity, Cross River Bank while 53% of their loan originations come from Credit Karma. Cross River Bank is always able to seek out different services and Credit Karma\u2019s parent company Intuit can very feasibly expand into this area as a competitor. Basically, while they do have a best-in-market product currently, that is not guaranteed and a few key players can crash UPST\u2019s business. Lastly, nearly all metrics and statistics regarding UPST versus traditional banking loan programs were self-procured and funded. There is very little independent research with their credit underwriting product and it is difficult to discern fact from marketing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The verdict\n\nAs UPST stands, I believe that they are overvalued after a 200% run to the upside in just 3 months. I completely support their business model and believe that they are a best-in-market company. However, even with their current rapid growth, they are fighting against decades of history with FICO scores and other traditional credit metrics. The banking industry is more known for stability than disruption and rapid change. While UPST is exerting pressure by offering their own loan program, it is obvious that this loan program is not a priority, for them it\u2019s low growth with low investment. The scenario that justifies their currently valuation is if they very quickly join the big three credit bureaus (TransUnion, Experian, Equifax) while expanding very quickly within the auto loan industry. Their expansion into this business is still very early and its hard to predict whether or not it will work out. However, I do not believe that UPST will be able to penetrate into the big three credit bureau status due to the entrenched nature of FICO scores within banking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: No positions in this stock", "id": "qf4s6b", "created_utc": 1635121093.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "No TL DR?! what am I, literate?", "score": 32, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08393844962120056}, {"body": "Nobody knows what UPST does, especially Mark, so don\u2019t tell him", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Half the apes in here probably don\u2019t even know what AAPL and AMZN do.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amzn", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.44374722242355347}, {"body": "If you like UPST but don\u2019t like the valuation.
