{"title": "Mary Barra And Tesla: Misleading Investors?", "selftext": "Mary Barra is making headlines with her extremely funny statement that GM can \"absolutely catch Tesla in EV sales by 2025\". I must say I laughed at first, but then I reflected this could, or rather should, be more serious. \n\nAFAIK, GM's \\*own\\* forecast is for about 1m EVs in 2025. That's their own plan, not my interpretation of it. I welcome corrections. \n\nAlso, Tesla is \\*currently\\* producing at an annualised rate of around 1m EV a year. This is easy to calculate as in the last quarter 238,000 cars were produced, and production increases steadily as we all (and GM all too well) know. \n\nTherefore, it seems to me that one of the two is true: \n\n1) Mary Barra wants GM and Tesla shareholder to believe that Tesla will not increase, actually will likely decrease, EV production from here to 2025. \n\n2) Mary Barra is just ignoring the numbers her own company has put out and is making sweeping statements that have nothing to do with reality and are only meant to show some kind of bullish sentiment.   \n\nIn both cases, it seems to me that she is misleading her shareholders, making material misstatements concerning both Tesla and GM's planned EV production, and willingly omitting to state the blatantly obvious fact that Tesla is ramping up production at vast speed and is on track to produce, by 2025, a big multiple of GM's own production targets. \n\nShould this not be investigated by the SEC? Or can anybody go on TV and say whatever propaganda he feels like saying without fear of regulatory action? \n\nHonestly, the woman reminds me of those documentaries about WW II where we see German grandees ( I don't write the names here) assure their audience, in Autumn 1944, that victory is near.  \n\nI thought investors in a company were entitled to more than empty propaganda.

We\u2019ve got an absolute boatload of companies reporting this week across many different sectors, meaning we\u2019ve got plenty of opportunities to make some money. I prefer playing sell side this week, though that\u2019s not to say that there isn\u2019t chances to make money elsewhere! Educated gambles, theta plays, and collateral plays are all valid this time round. Let\u2019s get into it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Options are extremely expensive this week. Sell side reigns supreme.** Relative to their historical moves, most stocks have extremely expensive options.  $NKLA, $SKLZ, $CRSR, and $AMC will be the main tickers to trade, as they all have inflated premiums to the tune of nearly 2x their historical, giving us insane margins of safety. Even if there is an earnings blowout, we\u2019ll still be well within the wings of our spreads, allowing us to bag premiums for free. Most companies who\u2019ve already reported earnings this quarter have had very muted moves, and that trend is likely going to continue into this week. There\u2019s no reason for week 4 to be proportionally more volatile than the rest. I plan on running strangles on most of the above companies given that the premiums stay inflated throughout the week. For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to  [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **$PINS is inefficiently priced.** $PINS has a priced move of 10.5% but a historical move of 15%, meaning we have edge in this trade. Pinterest is a historically aggressive mover, and that\u2019s only going to be amplified due to the awkward resolution of the Paypal deal, leading me to believe we\u2019re going to have another large move this quarter. $PINS reports on Thursday, meaning that the options will be even cheaper due to theta, moving the 10.5% priced move closer to 8% or 9%, giving us added margins of safety.  For more information on earnings pricing inefficiencies, refer to the link in the point above.$SNAP. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity. So do $PENN and $DKNG.** Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you\u2019re bullish or bearish on *either company*, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we\u2019ll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, the IV on $UBER will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. **You could also look to do the same with $PENN and $DKNG.** This was just a crude summary, if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h_dsqxoNi4UM5f7zdYxEY41qYnGONDIQpi8_BL2S8NE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly!
