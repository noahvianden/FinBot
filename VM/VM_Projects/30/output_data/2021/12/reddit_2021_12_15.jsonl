I recently put what was left from Options gambling addiction into RIOT Blockchain. I fully understand that this sub is not for the discussion of B$%C$#N and would never want to soil WSB's good name, but this is a NASDAQ traded company with a lot of upside in the next 3-6 months. \n\nRIOT is a real company that is nearing profitability\n\nRIOT holds the largest B$%C$#N mining facility in the US and successfully mined 466 coins in November equating to a 298% increase  over the same period in November. The also ESS Metron to further build their market share and establish their position as the one of the two largest B$%C$#N mining operations in the US (The other being Marathon Digital Holdings)\n\nMost important is that for 2021RIOT mined 3387 coins at a total cost of $10096 per coin which is a getting lower as they become the most energy efficient mining operation in the business. This efficiency improved by 5% over the previous quarter. With a recent $600m raise the cash on hand alone raises the value of the company by 50% and those funds are being deployed to further lower the cost/coin mined. \n\nThe total net loss for Q3 was just $15.3M which bodes well as B$%C$#N is projected to hit $100k in the next 12 months and the cost to mine is falling. Rockdale, Texas has pulled out all the stops to keep energy costs low and mining being based in Texas will shield RIOT from Green New Deal initiatives as much of the Texas Grid is already on renewables. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\n[WSJ Price Target suggest 116&#37; based on current price target](https://preview.redd.it/p5xaiohnwo581.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=32b54433b2b7c9d0e2978c51b38f8f75f1c04528)\n\nRIOT is showing strong support at the $24 range and with the high price targets on Wall Street, it is extremely like that institutional and retail funds roll back into RIOT once we hit January. This is based on current B$%C$#N prices, if B$%C$#N goes to new ATHs the price action should accelerate. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[You get a piece of the WSJ for free!](https://preview.redd.it/a3s5qybtwo581.png?width=762&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e5b8f9a240c8b9442616693f609b3766d01be2f)\n\nBottom line: This stock is set to double in the next year if B$%C$#N stays steady or even dips a little more, if B$%C$#N goes to the $100k projection for 2022, we could see RIOT go 4x over 12 months\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Proof of the bags I hold](https://preview.redd.it/5dhle5jzuo581.png?width=1863&format=png&auto=webp&s=91b14263ac50e2dd55f3b8e93aa6f76cd0507d9c)", "id": "rgx1od", "created_utc": 1639567901.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "i think i\u2019ll join in the fuckery", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "yes sir, i bought couple days after OP blessed me with this.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.059628963470458984}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20386219024658203}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1903010904788971}, {"body": "What about HUT?
