You see the inverse effect when VIX spikes and goes into bacwardation.\n\nI have only been watching/learning about $VIX and /VIX closely for only about a year now. It looks like most monthly /VIX products tend to start their lives at 20-25, then decay down towards $VIX spot (unless there is a major bear market as their expiration nears). Which makes sense, because market stabilization takes longer to settle in than a sudden scare. So a given /VIX future expiry sort of hangs up high when they are first traded (representing sort of 'intrinsic value' of the possibility of a $VIX/SOQ spike) an then swoops down to meet $VIX within a month or two of the SOQ. Isn't it just like theta decay for options, but with only one 'strike' (the /VIX### spot) per expiry? Isn't that part of the reasoning behind why the $VIX option chains actually borrow the next /VIX spot as the moneyline (instead of the $VIX spot)?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Since you have a scientific background I'll use some math because there's a limit to what I can explain with words only. \n\n>I don't really get the very last thing you say here, though -- hard to \"replicate\"? $VIX spot is just like a pulse of the intrinsic value of the SPX options, a made up measuring stick for volatility... there isn't really a thing to be \"replicating,\" exactly?\n\nThat is the crux of my argument. VIX itself can't be replicated risk-free, but you can build a portfolio that has something like 0.97 correlation if you delta hedge a portfolio that has a bunch of OTM S&P500 options, so that a risk averse abitrageur will arbitrage VIX futures with these delta hedged baskets of options if there is a sufficient financial incentive to do so. \n\nWhat happens is that VIX futures evolve according to these baskets of options, because it's the best thing market participants arbitraging these futures have (along with a whole bunch of related volatility derivatives). The discrepancy between the performance of the basket of options and the VIX index is a source of risk for arbitrageurs, which is why arbitrageurs will ask for a premium on VIX futures (otherwise they wouldn't be making enough money to compensate their risk). \n\nThe discrepancies with the real VIX come from the costs of transacting these options including liquidity, the losses due to the theta of the options, since the VIX is composed of short term options, the losses due to delta hedging and additional losses from imperfect correlation with the VIX (this parameter is somewhat discretionary), which I'm calling hedging errors. \n\nFutures are priced as follows:\n\nF(0,T) = S(0) \u00d7 exp[(r - q + c)\u00d7 T]\n\nWhere F(0, T) is the current quote for a future that expires in T units of time, S is the spot price, r is the interest rate at which arbitrageurs finance themselves, q is the yield of the underlying (it should be zero for VIX futures since we're talking about a delta hedged basket of options) and c is the cost of storage, which here is the sum of transaction costs and hedging errors as a percentage of the spot price. T is the time to maturity of the future. \n\nIf we assume for a moment that the partial derivatives of r, q and c with respect to T are null (which is not true), you can see that the quotes of futures are upward sloping if r - q + c > 0. This is what is understood by contango.\n\nJust to be clear, q = 0 for VIX futures if we assume there are no arbitrage opportunities, which isn't really the case in reality. \n\nExample: if S = 20, r = 1%, q = 0% and c = 49% and we set a unit of time to be one year\n\nNB: The numbers are completely made up.  \n\nF(0, 1/12) = 20.85\n\nF(0, 1/4) = 22.66\n\nF(0, 1/2) = 25.68\n\nF(0, 1) = 32.97\n\n>Isn't it just like theta decay for options, but with only one 'strike' (the /VIX### spot) per expiry?\n\nYes, as time goes by, the value of such a future goes down. With some basic calculus, the theta of a future is - (r - q + c) \u00d7 S(0) \u00d7 exp[(r - q + c)\u00d7 T], which means that the longer dated the future is, the more it loses money over time (assuming r - q + c > 0) and that short dated futures lose less money over the same amount of time. They finally converge to the spot price as they near expiration because when T = 0 the exponential goes to 1.\n\nNow in reality, r, q and c are a function of T, which is what we call in finance the \"term structure\" and they evolve with the market (they are correlated with the spot price for a fixed T). \n\nIn the case of VIX futures, when VIX spikes intensely that's when it gets really risky and costly to arbitrage futures (because of gamma and another second order greek called veta on the underlying basket of options), therefore arbitrageurs might back off until things cool down and it's also when other market participants put on buying pressure on short term VIX futures. That's when you'll see a huge discount on longer dated VIX futures, which is what is called backwardation. In our case, this would be akin to seeing q going from zero to a nonzero number, which represents the profit you get from making this market by arbitraging VIX futures, and since these arbitrage opportunities increase when VIX spikes and arbitrageurs leave the market (as does the risk of arbitraging), q increases. The reason arbitrageurs are leaving and entering the market is that since the arbitrage isn't risk-free and is even quite risky (at least much more than other futures), they are acting like risk averse investors with risk contraints.\n\nThis makes it so that VIX futures are downward sloping during extreme events. \n\nExample: if S = 80, r = 1%, q = 200% and c = 69% and we set a unit of time to be one year\n\nNB: The numbers are completely made up. \n\nF(0, 1/12) = 71.78\n\nF(0, 1/4) = 57.80\n\nF(0, 1/2) = 41.76\n\nF(0, 1) = 21.80\n\nYou'll notice that since r - q + c < 0, the futures theta is positive therefore VIX futures gain value over time in these conditions. \n\nWhen things clear up and arbitrageurs feel safer, they go back to arbitraging and other market participants stop their buying pressure, which lets the futures curve revert to a state of contango. \n\nNow these are oversimplifications, but I hope it helps.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5521090030670166}], "tickers": ["vix"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "IV crush will kill you and end up with huge loss!\n\nIt is crazy to think your first trade with UVXY options!!!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Learning \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 thank you.
