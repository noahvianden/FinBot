{"title": "Using delta to calculate an option's leverage | tutorial + example", "selftext": "Maybe a lot of people use strategies where they don't really care about how leveraged their options are, but I personally always like to know. When you walk through them and see that one is x6 leverage and one is x35 it opens your eyes and makes you think a bit more carefully about what you're doing. This applies to selling options just as much as it applies to buying them, you're just on the other side of the fence.\n\nI like to follow the philosophy that if you can't teach something you don't understand it well enough so I made this into a video which is linked at the bottom. I'm going to explain everything here though. \n\nWhen I did this math Visa was trading at $243.17 per share. You can buy a call with a strike price of 240 that expires September 17th for $853. This call has a delta of about 0.59. I'm assuming the people here at least know that delta exists and where to find it. This means that this option currently moves up and down with the \u201cpower\u201d of 59 shares. If this option moves deeper in the money this number will increase. If this option moves out of the money this number will decrease. \n\nKnowing that this option moves as if it were 59 shares is the key to finding its leverage. 59 shares at Visa\u2019s current price would cost $14,347 but you only need to pay $853 for this contract which has the same ability to make or lose money. So with $14,347 you could buy 16 of these contracts which means this contract has about 16 times leverage. You can calculate this exactly by dividing $14,347 by 853 to get the amount of leverage at that moment, which is 16.82. So, every dollar you put into these Visa calls is going to gain or lose almost 17 times more than if you just bought shares. This leverage value is one of the minor greeks and is called lambda. Lambda is a derivative of delta and some places might show it directly, though it seems to be uncommon in my experience. \n\nA 2 year call on AAPL could be as conservative as 2x leverage and your 0 DTE SPY calls could have 100x. Know what you're getting yourself into before you throw your money into something. \n\nTLDR: Option Leverage = (Delta * Share Price) / Option Price\n\nExample: Visa 240c 9/17 = (59 * 243.17) / 853 = 16.82\n\nVideo version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W7PTtljLtE\n\nSubreddit: r/financialanalysis", "id": "pq1v2v", "created_utc": 1631890974.0, "score": 224, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "Great lesson!", "score": 21, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04717899113893509}, {"body": "delta dollars = portfolio delta * underlying price\n\nEdit: Weight for a given underlying in IBKR risk navigator = delta dollars / total delta dollars.", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Interesting, will check IBKR for this.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20249998569488525}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14567521214485168}, {"body": "Great stuff!
