Then putting the two systems together would give them a perception system that's atleast 1000x better than humans.\n\nThen he talks about the hard problem which is determining the drivable path, which lane goes where, where to stop, who has priority, what traffic light leads to where. Then he says ML isn't good enough today to handle that and to do it perfectly everytime in variety of weather with 99.99999% safety. This is where mapping comes in. You are still using ML to determine all of that, but you are creating maps with the result of the NN outputs.\n\nRemember everything he listed you can also determine using a car equipped with lidar.

{"title": "Stuck on credit spreads...", "selftext": "Long time lurker. So recently I have started to ramp up leverage and doing more spreads. One thing I am stuck on is, for credit spreads, is it better to open them with a bigger width, or smaller but sell more contracts? Basically which would be higher probability of success?\n\nfor example MSFT 290P/270P vs. 290/285 but you open 4 contracts\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthank you for everyone's input. very helpful", "id": "ptd5yd", "created_utc": 1632333615.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "Here is my take on this, assuming you will risk the same amount on both, there are four main factors that need to be considered here:\r  \n\r  \n**1-Break even vs Risk/Reward:**\r  \n\r  \nWith a single wide spread, your breakeven point is wider than the narrow spread which in turn increases your probability of profit and that in turns means higher risk to reward ratio aka less total credit received. Which one would you prefer? higher probability of profit, or higher total credit?\r  \n\r  \n**2-Commission and Slippage:**\r  \n\r  \nWith a narrow spread the slippage is significant. You will notice this even in liquid underlyings like TSLA, the bid/ask spread is relatively pretty wide for $1 wide spreads, not as much for a $10 or $20 wide spreads. Even worse, you're giving away pennies in slippage many times more when you open multiple spreads.\r  \n\r  \nAlso, if your broker charges commissions or fees it can add up in multiple spreads.\r  \n\r  \n**3-Greeks:**\r  \n\r  \nGreeks (I mainly consider theta here) might theoretically add up to be better in the case of multiple narrow spreads, but in practice when you factor in slippage, and real-pricing you'll find out that most of the time the wide spread hits its profit target faster than multiple narrow spreads. I don't have any back tests to back this up, but this is what I noticed and it makes sense to me because of the narrower break even point.\r  \n\r  \n**4-Management**\r  \n\r  \nIt's a lot easier to manage (by rolling out for a credit mainly) a single wide spread rather than a few tight ones. The reason being is once the stock price crosses somewhere in the middle of your strikes a credit spread's theta turns negative. Which means you can't roll for a credit anymore. With a tight spread since your long leg is very close to your short leg, and when you factor in slippage, it becomes almost non-practical to roll for a credit if your spreads are challenged at all. Another way to look at this, is it's theoretically always possible to roll a naked option for a credit. Wide spreads behave the closest to a naked option, then it would be easier to roll them out for a credit.\r  \n\r  \n**Conclusion:**\r  \n\r  \nMy personal experience is that selling naked options is what I prefer going after. If your account is small and you can't handle selling naked then spreads are the way to go. Wider spreads behave the closest to naked options, that's mainly why I'm leaning towards them.\r  \n\r  \nSlippage and the narrower breakeven makes realized theta decay slower in narrower spreads.\r  \n\r  \nAnd finally, some of the conclusions made in this comment is my personal experience/opinion.

{"title": "How I use Data Science to Trade Options Around Earnings", "selftext": "Recently I started a trading strategy around earnings releases. These periods tend to experience movements and volatility that can make for good opportunities in options trading. These types of trades are also riskier than other periods because of a lot of factors playing against you, like time decay and especially the IV crush that happens after the release, making most bought options worthless by itself.\n\nLike most things, the market prices-in the expected volatility and movements of the stock prices around earnings. By studying iv and other factors, one can actually estimate this market expectation.\n\nUsually traders prefer to be on the sell side of options before earnings to take advantage of the iv crush and a stock price movement that stays within the market expectation. However, a lot of stocks end up beating this expected move for a multitude of reasons: way better or worse results ending in investors adjusting their positions, but also a detail in the report or guidance can shift expectations, and anyway the stock ends up moving more than expected move. This make for very profitable options trades when we are on the buy side and we actually hold through earnings. The goal here is to spot these companies.\n\n# Idea\n\nThe main idea of the approach here is to let the data speak for itself. The end goal is to build a classification model that \u201cspots\u201d companies likely to beat market expectation, First we need to define that expectation. A first approximation can be to consider the average of the historic moves and add some offset as a multiplier of its standard variation. If we are able to predict if a company is likely to move higher than what it used to do it can be a first clue to look deeper and assess options opportunities.\n\n# Features\n\nSince I\u2019m not aiming at predicting a particular direction of movement, I will be mostly using features that reflect the market behaviour around earnings for every stock. I will use 3 categories of features:\n\n\\- **Company related**\n\nSector of activity, market cap, size of shareholders, time since ipo, ..\n\n\\- **Earnings related**  \nI am looking at the behaviour of the stock price, stock volume and options values around earnings. For every company, I calculated the movement occurring in each indicator every day the week of the earnings, and record the maximum in absolute value. The learning set needs to have historic occurrences so we can use the actual values of these indicators to make predictions. An example of these features looks like this for TSLA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tudca560zo71.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9f251e330d9c37ca2333d57712ebd6bf6641680\n\n\\- **News related**  \nThe goal here is to let the model know how news coverage may help predict a big movement around earnings that would beat the market expectation. We need an indicator of this coverage, so we will use the number of articles as well as a sentiment score. I scrapped all pages of [investorshub.](https://investorshub.advfn.com/)com every day and classified articles by date and stock concerned with the news. I then run Vader algorithm for news sentiment extraction so we can obtain a score by day reflecting how positive or negative the news was. I then record the average positive and negative score for the last 30 days before each earnings date. Here is a sample :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fl9lxoq70zo71.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=94f9193c02adb5a4cfd56825e37b5f47ba68d444\n\n# Target\n\nNow that we have all these indicators going back to 2015, we can add the target we will be looking for. We are interested in an actual stock move that outperforms the expected one, that we define it to be the average of historic move. For each date, we can then average the previous movements and set our classification to target to either 1 if the actual absolute move is higher than the average at that point and 0 otherwise.\n\nWe end up with a dataset of +300k releases and approximately 30% of the observations have a positive target.\n\n# Model\n\nThe next step is to actually train our machine learning model and study the results. A lot of important data-science steps are involved that I will not dive into, for example we need our model to not overfit and actually be able to compare the results versus a random model and use a score metric that actually makes sense. The model used here is [xgboost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost), as it is a natural extension of an intuitive model that we an actually interpret (I will write up a dedicated article about all this).\n\nWe obtain a decent performance over all stocks of around 60%, with some having very high predictability by our model which is what we aim for. Here is a graph of the distribution of the model scores across all stocks. The score used is the [roc score.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9d8ku0790zo71.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9ba3d87e028435dee6d4f4332efa87fc1959f99\n\n# Results\n\nTo backtest our approach, we can look at how our model behaved on previous predictions and compare them with actual outcomes. This should be coherent with the scores and results obtained above if the preprocessing and processing we did was correct.\n\nLooking at the last two months, we can calculate the difference between the actual move and the target the model predicted the stock would beat, we see that when filtering for stocks with probability > 60% and a general roc score higher than 55%, the realised performance is actually a bit higher than the expected 60% (which makes sense since we\u2019re keeping only high predictions and those the model is most confident about):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hktqg7bc0zo71.png?width=1140&format=png&auto=webp&s=323628b09d7f59cbc5d839f3af30496fffadf88c\n\nThis model is behind the data and recommendations of [earnings-watcher.tech](http://earnings-watcher.tech/) where you can browse into what was discussed here.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tt8om0hd0zo71.png?width=3360&format=png&auto=webp&s=8271c47915e2fbe90ce8573014b3e85f8e7c6f45\n\nI use the platform to calibrate for my options trades around earnings for the high risk / high reward positions like discussed in the beginning.

This is perfect for a holiday stock buy because over the next 4 months you are going to see the price rise due to this and what's even better...\n\nThe stores have a natural break point attached to their rent agreements. This means if the store makes over a certain amount the mall gets a percentage of that.\n\nThis year is going to be huge.\n\nThe mall has been packed and I have been doing very well on both my companies. I pay SPG thousands of dollars for rent and it is going up a lot in November so I thought you all should know so all my money goes to your wife after the divorce.\n\nEven though I jumped in late for the covid recovery I really like the stock and the dividends have kept me holding for many months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am in with 99 shares 133ish average.
