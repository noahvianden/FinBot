The only way I can see someone losing lots of money like that would be selling the calls at strike prices under their cost basis, but even in that scenario I can\u2019t see them going to zero\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There are a lot of strategies that an options trader can employ beyond just buying and selling calls.  Some of them involve being both a buyer and a seller and another dimension is that they can be calls or puts.  So there can be multiple options involved in a single play.  It's quite interesting really.\n\nTo keep things simple though we can just stay focused on calls, but even then there is more then one way.  Probably the most intuitive is a 'covered call'.  This is where you own a sufficient number of shares, 100 per contract, of the underlying stock to fulfill your obligation to the buyer should the contract end up in-the-money and you get assigned.  In this case you'll receive money from the sale of the underlying shares, but you're still losing money.  People will talk about cost basis and such, but if you have to sell something for less than it's worth, then you're losing money.  Though it won't decrease your account balance.\n\nHowever, there is another strategy called a 'naked call'.  This is similar to a covered call but the difference is that you don't own sufficient shares of the underlying stock to fulfill your obligation.  If the seller finds themselves in the position of having the contract(s) assigned then they will have to buy enough shares of the underlying at the current market price to fulfill their obligation to the buyer(s).  Their losses will be the difference between the current price of the underlying and the strike price of the option, less the premium, x100 per contract.  This is a worst-case scenario and we have to assume multiple mistakes on the part of the seller, but you can lose all of your money and more selling calls.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6999238133430481}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5180792808532715}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48427605628967285}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23067031800746918}, {"body": "Just buy the s&p 500 and your favorite few Blue chips, reinvest your dividends and stay away from Options.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah that's what I will do.

Yesterday we pushed past a resistance line at around $778-$780 on the daily and today, although a red day for the stock, we actually have a very bullish signal forming.  We sold down to around that resistance line and bought back up to post a daily candle above.... potentially confirming it as a new support. \n\nThis was the last resistance left on the before all time highs of about $900.  Additionally, Tesla has received several price upgrades as analysts in the last few day and they are expecting delivery numbers to put the companies current production rate at around 1 million vehicles per year presently, although the total for 2021 is expected to be in the low to mid 900k deliveries.

{"title": "\ud83d\ude80At the heart of the smart city BB DD\ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "Aloha gentletards, I\u2019m here to tell you about a little 100 banger. Bb\n\nTLDR: bb has more exposure and better tech in regards to RTOS in not just the automotive sector but also in industrial. Ivy could revolutionize cars and monetize car data exponentially. Cyber security is as good as crwd, according to real world hacking testing done by SE labs. Patent sale finalization 80% probability done this quarter- rumored to be 1B+ and 7 year trailing while retaining rights to use patents.\n\n***this DD will be a work in progress and will be updated as much as I can***\nLet\u2019s start with QNX and IVY.\n***QNX***\nQNX is a non-Linux based microkernel RtOs. Let\u2019s break that down piece by piece: non-linux/microkernel- Linux by design is a monolithic kernel that runs all operating system components in kernel space; it includes all device drivers, file management, and networking and graphics stacks. Only user applications run in user space. Although a monolithic design protects a kernel from errant user code, it doesn\u2019t protect it from errant kernel code. A single programming error (or successful exploit) in a file system, protocol stack or driver can crash a monolithic operating system. January 2020, the Linux kernel had around 27.8 million lines of code in its Git repository; with about 100 thousand lines of code the QNX Neutrino RTOS is 99.7% smaller. Smaller foot print= less vulnerability.\nA microkernel operating system embodies a fundamental innovation in the delivery of OS functionality: modularity. The tiny kernel is a side effect. With a microkernel OS, the microkernel works with a team of optional cooperating processes that provide higher-level OS functionality. Critically, unlike with a monolithic kernel, these processes run in user space; that is, outside privileged kernel space.  A microkernel OS like the QNX Neutrino RTOS encapsulates each application and OS service in its own isolated process space. The microkernel protects and allocates memory, and gives drivers and other OS services only the minimum privileges they need to perform their functions. \n***RTOS vs OS***\n\nA Real-time Operating System (RTOS) is an OS for devices and systems that need to react quickly to a trigger. In the case of a software fail-safe, for instance, an RTOS would pre-empt lower priority processes to take care of the higher-priority task. The LiDAR and video imaging that autonomous vehicles use to drive the car down a highway without straying outside the lines or hitting anything is very compute-intensive. It makes sense that a complex system with life-safety responsibilities might have an RTOS so that a processor can make a quick decision. On the other hand, an OS can be detrimental if it\u2019s not really needed, and yet necessary if the system has a processor that must be interrupted so it can react to high priority tasks. Traditional MCUs are not going to run several threads simultaneously and are not going to have sophisticated interrupt capabilities. A while ago, the embedded world was mostly populated by MCUs due to the high price of performance computing and the fact that simple control loops were all that was needed. LINUX based car OS\u2019s are just that, operating systems that lack in priority management and interrupts.\n***IVY***\nQNX, but ***cloud connected***. \u201cBlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.\u201d\nSo all that sensor data flowing through qnx is or can be valuable both to the OEM\u2019s and to third party app developers. From a user stand point, imagine at App Store for your car that you can download cool shit from. You know how Tesla\u2019s can make your car fart? Imagine that\u2026 but not having to pay for a tsla. Or an app that allows you to make payments for tolls, gas, food, etc from your car([car payments](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-ivy-to-provide-secure-vehicle-based-payments). \nFrom an OEM standpoint, the sensor data alone is a gold mine. Being able to track real world, real time conditions of their vehicles could/should streamline production, recalls, and r&d. The potential for a cloud-base RTOS is infinite.\nBest part about IVY? ***SUBSCRIPTION BASED***\nIf IVY gains the same amount of vehicles as QNX and the annual subscription per car is say 10 bucks. Annual gross would be 1.95 billion. At the same ratios that would put the stock roughly at 2x current levels.\n\nCompetitors for QNX/IVY- doesn\u2019t really exist yet. From a technical standpoint or an exposure stand point. Android auto is gaining traction but here is a list of manufactures for android auto: 2020 Polestar 2\n2021 Volvo XC40 P8\n2021 Volvo XC40 Recharge\n2022 GMC Hummer EV\n2022 Renault Megane E-Tech Electric\n2022 Volvo XC60\n2022 Volvo S90\n2022 Volvo V90\n2022 Volvo V90 Cross Country\n2023 Ford cars\n2023 Lincoln cars\nWhere as qnx(automotive and industrial)\n\n.[companies](https://enlyft.com/tech/products/qnx) not sure if up to date.\n\n\n***Patent sale***\nCEO John Chen gave 80:20 odds of the deal being closed this quarter. The facts- bb will retain the right to use these patents after the sale.The price has been pretty much settled.\nthe rumors: a lump payment up front + 7 years trailing. \nMore facts- bb has not been able to claim or collect revenue from these patents during these negations. Factoring that in since the patent sale has been in litigation. 115mil annual- 28.75M per quarter- since q4 fy21 has been missing from earnings. \nMore rumors- conservative estimates in the range of 1B to 2B. I won\u2019t talk about the higher end rumors because even i(a dude who unironically invested in GNUS)\n\n\n\n\nSome accolades :\n-Bb has secured design wins with 24 out of the top 25 EV manufacturers in the world, representing 82% of global EV volumes. An increase from 23 from last quarter. The final hold out, while not being named- being tsla.\n-SE labs conducted breach testing using \u201creal world hacker techniques\u201d with a 0 penetration result. Meaning with current means, or as current as SE labs employs, bb was impenetrable.

Some of them involve being both a buyer and a seller and another dimension is that they can be calls or puts.  So there can be multiple options involved in a single play.  It's quite interesting really.\n\nTo keep things simple though we can just stay focused on calls, but even then there is more then one way.  Probably the most intuitive is a 'covered call'.  This is where you own a sufficient number of shares, 100 per contract, of the underlying stock to fulfill your obligation to the buyer should the contract end up in-the-money and you get assigned.  In this case you'll receive money from the sale of the underlying shares, but you're still losing money.  People will talk about cost basis and such, but if you have to sell something for less than it's worth, then you're losing money.  Though it won't decrease your account balance.\n\nHowever, there is another strategy called a 'naked call'.  This is similar to a covered call but the difference is that you don't own sufficient shares of the underlying stock to fulfill your obligation.  If the seller finds themselves in the position of having the contract(s) assigned then they will have to buy enough shares of the underlying at the current market price to fulfill their obligation to the buyer(s).  Their losses will be the difference between the current price of the underlying and the strike price of the option, less the premium, x100 per contract.  This is a worst-case scenario and we have to assume multiple mistakes on the part of the seller, but you can lose all of your money and more selling calls.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6999238133430481}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5180792808532715}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48427605628967285}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23067031800746918}, {"body": "Just buy the s&p 500 and your favorite few Blue chips, reinvest your dividends and stay away from Options.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah that's what I will do.

{"title": "\ud83d\ude80At the heart of the smart city BB DD\ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "Aloha gentletards, I\u2019m here to tell you about a little 100 banger. Bb\n\nTLDR: bb has more exposure and better tech in regards to RTOS in not just the automotive sector but also in industrial. Ivy could revolutionize cars and monetize car data exponentially. Cyber security is as good as crwd, according to real world hacking testing done by SE labs. Patent sale finalization 80% probability done this quarter- rumored to be 1B+ and 7 year trailing while retaining rights to use patents.\n\n***this DD will be a work in progress and will be updated as much as I can***\nLet\u2019s start with QNX and IVY.\n***QNX***\nQNX is a non-Linux based microkernel RtOs. Let\u2019s break that down piece by piece: non-linux/microkernel- Linux by design is a monolithic kernel that runs all operating system components in kernel space; it includes all device drivers, file management, and networking and graphics stacks. Only user applications run in user space. Although a monolithic design protects a kernel from errant user code, it doesn\u2019t protect it from errant kernel code. A single programming error (or successful exploit) in a file system, protocol stack or driver can crash a monolithic operating system. January 2020, the Linux kernel had around 27.8 million lines of code in its Git repository; with about 100 thousand lines of code the QNX Neutrino RTOS is 99.7% smaller. Smaller foot print= less vulnerability.\nA microkernel operating system embodies a fundamental innovation in the delivery of OS functionality: modularity. The tiny kernel is a side effect. With a microkernel OS, the microkernel works with a team of optional cooperating processes that provide higher-level OS functionality. Critically, unlike with a monolithic kernel, these processes run in user space; that is, outside privileged kernel space.  A microkernel OS like the QNX Neutrino RTOS encapsulates each application and OS service in its own isolated process space. The microkernel protects and allocates memory, and gives drivers and other OS services only the minimum privileges they need to perform their functions. \n***RTOS vs OS***\n\nA Real-time Operating System (RTOS) is an OS for devices and systems that need to react quickly to a trigger. In the case of a software fail-safe, for instance, an RTOS would pre-empt lower priority processes to take care of the higher-priority task. The LiDAR and video imaging that autonomous vehicles use to drive the car down a highway without straying outside the lines or hitting anything is very compute-intensive. It makes sense that a complex system with life-safety responsibilities might have an RTOS so that a processor can make a quick decision. On the other hand, an OS can be detrimental if it\u2019s not really needed, and yet necessary if the system has a processor that must be interrupted so it can react to high priority tasks. Traditional MCUs are not going to run several threads simultaneously and are not going to have sophisticated interrupt capabilities. A while ago, the embedded world was mostly populated by MCUs due to the high price of performance computing and the fact that simple control loops were all that was needed. LINUX based car OS\u2019s are just that, operating systems that lack in priority management and interrupts.\n***IVY***\nQNX, but ***cloud connected***. \u201cBlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.\u201d\nSo all that sensor data flowing through qnx is or can be valuable both to the OEM\u2019s and to third party app developers. From a user stand point, imagine at App Store for your car that you can download cool shit from. You know how Tesla\u2019s can make your car fart? Imagine that\u2026 but not having to pay for a tsla. Or an app that allows you to make payments for tolls, gas, food, etc from your car([car payments](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-ivy-to-provide-secure-vehicle-based-payments). \nFrom an OEM standpoint, the sensor data alone is a gold mine. Being able to track real world, real time conditions of their vehicles could/should streamline production, recalls, and r&d. The potential for a cloud-base RTOS is infinite.\nBest part about IVY? ***SUBSCRIPTION BASED***\nIf IVY gains the same amount of vehicles as QNX and the annual subscription per car is say 10 bucks. Annual gross would be 1.95 billion. At the same ratios that would put the stock roughly at 2x current levels.\n\nCompetitors for QNX/IVY- doesn\u2019t really exist yet. From a technical standpoint or an exposure stand point. Android auto is gaining traction but here is a list of manufactures for android auto: 2020 Polestar 2\n2021 Volvo XC40 P8\n2021 Volvo XC40 Recharge\n2022 GMC Hummer EV\n2022 Renault Megane E-Tech Electric\n2022 Volvo XC60\n2022 Volvo S90\n2022 Volvo V90\n2022 Volvo V90 Cross Country\n2023 Ford cars\n2023 Lincoln cars\nWhere as qnx(automotive and industrial)\n\n.[companies](https://enlyft.com/tech/products/qnx) not sure if up to date.\n\n\n***Patent sale***\nCEO John Chen gave 80:20 odds of the deal being closed this quarter. The facts- bb will retain the right to use these patents after the sale.The price has been pretty much settled.\nthe rumors: a lump payment up front + 7 years trailing. \nMore facts- bb has not been able to claim or collect revenue from these patents during these negations. Factoring that in since the patent sale has been in litigation. 115mil annual- 28.75M per quarter- since q4 fy21 has been missing from earnings. \nMore rumors- conservative estimates in the range of 1B to 2B. I won\u2019t talk about the higher end rumors because even i(a dude who unironically invested in GNUS)\n\n\n\n\nSome accolades :\n-Bb has secured design wins with 24 out of the top 25 EV manufacturers in the world, representing 82% of global EV volumes. An increase from 23 from last quarter. The final hold out, while not being named- being tsla.\n-SE labs conducted breach testing using \u201creal world hacker techniques\u201d with a 0 penetration result. Meaning with current means, or as current as SE labs employs, bb was impenetrable.
