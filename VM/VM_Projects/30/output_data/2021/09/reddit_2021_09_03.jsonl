There is no financial release, and the only news is about a new business venture into delivery. No catalyst here.\n\nThe second movement is in the later months of 2017. It looks like it is mostly driven by a massive buyback.\n\nThe third movement was a result of a bad financial report. There are also issues with e-commerce competition.\n\nThe fourth movement is because of strong growth, despite weak earnings.\n\nThe fifth movement is because there was worry that the electronic business was not doing well, and financial weakness was being realized.\n\nThe sixth movement was the covid dip.\n\nThe seventh movement is due to internal statements on safety and media optimism to wmt ability to adapt to covid.\n\nThe final movement is due to WMT increasing wages, having poor earnings, and economic reports.\n\nBased on this information, there is too much risk to bet against WMT. Some movements seem to defy gravity, and back to school sales as well as economic reports will add too much uncertainty to the bet as they have been shown to have unpredictable effects on the share price.", "id": "pgwzvm", "created_utc": 1630639272.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|5|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14746350049972534}, {"body": "So you wanted to buy puts against Walmart, and decided against it?", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "I read this twice thinking I was the retarded one", "score": 28, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11620835214853287}, {"body": "I read the first sentence, bought puts on Walmart, came back to read the rest and then instantly regretting my purchase.   \ud83c\udf4c", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Then sell a put deeper otm, nfa", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.44602373242378235}], "tickers": ["wmt"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Lol", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1366499364376068}, {"body": ">.\n\nlosing my last brain cells trying to figure this out myself. wtf??", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10031650960445404}], "tickers": ["wmt"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "TL;DR\n\nToo much information for retards.\n\nOn the other hand Walmart is increasing their eCommerce footprint and their delivery/pickup is getting better.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Their delivery is pretty good, most items you can get next day", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.39420783519744873}], "tickers": ["wmt"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Walmart is mandating their warehouse employs 50+ hour work weeks and paying them $500 bonuses every check just for not calling out for any of their shifts.

{"title": "The Big Short 2.1 - A Revision of the Flawed Execution of a Beautiful Thesis", "selftext": "Konichiwa, weebs. A few days back, a beautiful man with gorgeous hair names u/roman_axt turned me into a \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3bwith [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) post. I know ~~half~~ over half of you can't read, so I'll keep it short here. Essentially, through a combination of the Elliott Wave theory, Fibonacci retracements, and an SMA on the one-month chart for SPY, Roman theorized a market crash was coming. It was a great post and it opened a lot of eyes to the potential for a major (and I mean major) correction, but there's only one issue. His model showed the peak would be at $420.69. While this is very nice, SPY has already shot past that and the market is still popping off. Clearly something was wrong here, but I don't think it was conceptually too far off. I hit the books (TradinigView) and came up with this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Like Roman's, but this one is actually correct](https://preview.redd.it/0lxugkfzccl71.png?width=1566&format=png&auto=webp&s=8db298ac642d91c8372a8f33e6fc358fa53a5267)\n\nIf you know anything about TA, you'll know that the thing on the right is volume. Roman tried to line up the Fibonacci lines with price action, which was unsuccessful. Not only did the estimate prove to be wrong, but the lines didn't really match up with any of the peaks or valleys. Here's my innovation: I matched the Fibonacci lines with spikes in volume rather than extreme pricing. Notice how, with the exception of 0.618, every single ratio lines up almost perfectly with a spike in volume. Knowing this, there are 2 potential places where price might consolidate and fall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor a more detailed explanation, click [here](https://youtu.be/BNeUI7pqEtk).
