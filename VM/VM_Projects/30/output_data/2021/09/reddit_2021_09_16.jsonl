{"title": "Weber, Inc. - WEBR (and why you should know about it).", "selftext": "Like many of you, I completely missed the news that Weber (the grill company), ticker WEBR, and Traeger (the grill company Joe Rogan owns and posts pictures of his elk meat he cooks with it), ticker COOK, went public nearly at the same time this year, in late July/early August. Completely fucking missed it. Not to fear, both stocks have not done so well (in terms of stock price) and WEBR is actually only up about 6.5% over it's $14.00 IPO price as of end of afterhours trading today. And that is only after a stellar trading day which saw WEBR move up over 7%! Why did this happen?\n\nWell, WEBR posted a phenomenal maiden quarterly earnings report after IPOing on August 5th! One of the craziest things about this company, unlike many of the companies that we autists love, is they ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY. Now I understand that this is a foreign concept, both for companies and in your personal accounts, and actually seems borderline \"against the rules\" in this crazy bipolar JPOW fueled market, but none the less the numbers look great. Some highlights from Weber's release:\n\n* Set a **fifth straight year-over-year quarterly sales record**, quarter ending June 30, 2021, as net sales increased 19%, to $669 million, from $561 million in the prior year quarter. \n\n* Net Income was $18 million or 2.7% of net sales and Adjusted EBITDA was $134 million or 20.1% of net sales despite distribution, inbound freight, and commodity cost inflation headwinds.\n\n* Fiscal year-to-date sales up 41%, to $1,632 million, from $1,157 million versus the same period last year.\n\n* For the **nine months ended June 30, adjusted EBITDA increased 62%**, to $321 million, or 19.7% of net sales, compared to $199 million, or 17.2% of net sales in the prior year nine months.\n\n**FULL FISCAL YEAR 2021 GUIDANCE**\n\n* For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, net sales are expected to be between $1,960 million and $1,970 million, up 28%-29% versus the prior year.\n\n* Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be $305 million to $310 million, up 35%-37% versus the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\n\nIn short this company is growing, it will continue to grow, and doesn't look like there will be much stopping it. The company was incorporated in the late 1800s, really got it's wings in the post war America of the 1950s (AMERICA FUCK YEA), owns about a quarter of the market share of grills globally and in USA, and has higher direct to consumer sales than Traeger at about 20% which cuts out money grubbing middlemen. About 75% of Weber's sales come from the grills themselves but of course they sell accessories, and other shit to go along with it. Obviously it is worth noting that not only has cooking at home in general boomed during the pandi the grilling sector has obviously been helped by the renewed interest in outdoor activities during the covid pandi. \"No Susan I won't come to your wine tasting out in the pool annex, but I will come over for some of Billy's grilled sausage, OUTSIDE!\". \n\nFinally, the CEO, Chris Scherzinger, is very willing to shill his product and try and not let Traeger get them by the balls because \"Joe Rogan is cool man\". He recently went on our favorite creatures show and shilled a new portable grill (actually looks decent) and told coke-head Cramer (who is wearing a fucking apron!) that they are barely keeping up with demand and the future demand with tailgate and camping season will be high. Again, things that are generally considered safer than sitting around in restaurants and bars and sucking in each others air, as well as each others dicks as I know we all like to do. I also like that Weber CEO is old school boomer chad, while Traeger CEO is \"new age cool dad\" but that is just personal preference.

{"title": "What is being missed with peloton", "selftext": "Peloton's stock has had a rough year due to recalls and increased competition.   However there is something that is being overlooked that can change everything.\n\nRecalls aren't going to last much longer and already #peloton has restarted selling their less expensive tread mill.  However although #pton's success in the short term might rely on hardware sales, the long term outlook is all about subscriptions and engagement. \n\nPeloton is the clear leader in this space and has branded itself as both quality and luxury.   Forward projections have been based on current market size which I believe is the big mistake.\n\nThere is growing competition coming from other companies such as #Tonal, #nordik,  #mirror, and even #apple that is weighing on stock holders.   However what's being missed is the behavioral changes that will be created by all of these new options.   The market size for at home fitness is about to grow dramatically!\n\nFor example - 5 years ago only a couple people if that many worked out at home with any equipment at all.   There was 0 community and besides a few popular dvds and TV shows, home workouts was a disconnected and lonely experience.   Instead friends and partners would gather at gyms and clubs to get fit and be social.  However the trend is moving towards at home fitness and the pace will accelerate exponentially over the next few years.   Those same 5 friends you met at the gym will be connected at home and battling or supporting each other with online fitness communities.    \n\nSo if your family, friends and co-workers are working out at home, then guess where you will be?   Brings us back to Peloton being the clear leader but then again why must there be only one?   If Apple brings 10million into the market,  there is going to be a good portion that say this at home fitness is great but I also need a good treadmill, bike or perhaps rower.   Those loving their tonals can easily afford a #pton bike and most likely will have one for status anyway.    Everyone working out from home taking selfies could want the best fitness outfits and that could also be #peloton.  \n\nMy projections- Overall Peloton subscriptions will only go higher and higher.  The vast majority of peloton users love it and rave about it.   They will sport their outfits with pride and this company will grow to over 50million users world wide within 5 years.", "id": "ppc1ys", "created_utc": 1631794137.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|8|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.024722237139940262}, {"body": "Peloton should offer sexercise equipment", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "It would probably kill the children though.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Shouldn't it make children?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5148447751998901}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10047955811023712}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4589294195175171}, {"body": "I\u2019m literally in my downstairs gym right now.
