{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, May 10, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 10, 2021**\n\nStocks fell sharply on Monday, with technology stocks swiftly reversing from Friday to come under pressure once more as the risk of inflationary pressure and recent suggestions from monetary officials weigh on the mind of market participants. The Nasdaq (QQQ) sank 2.53%, its worst performance since March. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones (DIA) reached fresh intraday highs before pulling back while the S&P 500 (SPY) retreated from record levels, closing 0.95% down.\n\nMarket participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, it is important to note that monetary officials, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have repeatedly said they expect any inflationary pressures to be \u201ctransitory\u201d. In an April 28 meeting he said, \u201cAmid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.\u201d Looking ahead, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April consumer price index (CPI) is set to be released Wednesday and the producer price index (PPI) on Thursday. These will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers, and are expected to show a significant jump over last year's pandemic-depressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens.\n\nFurther spooking the markets is recent commentary from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen where she suggested interest rates may need to rise to prevent the economy from \u201coverheating\u201d. She said, \u201cIt may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them.\" In later remarks, she seemingly downplayed her remarks, saying that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, \u201cLet me be clear, that\u2019s not something I\u2019m predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.\u201d\n\nWhile it may seem like doom and gloom, this is the most important piece of the puzzle and why one shouldn\u2019t begin to panic about inflation or the economy overheating. Last Friday, the April Job Report reported only 266,000 jobs added in the month of April, missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916,000 jobs added in March. Despite significant progress, the economy remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below January 2020. The sharp decline in job growth allays fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy anytime soon, with Powell and other monetary officials consistently reiterating the Central Bank wants to see a \u201cstring\u201d of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million jobs added before any adjustment to the current policy is made. With the April report coming in far below estimates, the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets, meaning it is extremely unlikely to tighten its accommodative monetary policy anytime soon.\n\nIn short, a transitory rise in inflation is not surprising given the economy is recovering from a severe decline in prices from March 2020, and while substantial progress has been made, economic recovery, particularly in the labor market, remains far from complete.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) submitted an application with the US FDA to approve use of their coronavirus vaccine for individuals 16 and older\n* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be \"temporary.\"\n* The trial between Epic Games vs Apple (AAPL) has commenced. Epic has accused Apple of violating U.S. antitrust law and sued it in August after the tech giant yanked the developer's hit video game \"Fortnite\" from its App Store. Apple has defended itself by arguing that its app-marketplace policies are fair and that Epic breached a contract applicable to all developers distributing apps on its mobile devices by trying to make their own market place within the app store. Epic Games also sued Alphabet on similar grounds. Apple is facing a similar lawsuit in Europe filed by Spotify (SPOT)\n* U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo plans to hold a May 20 meeting with senior U.S. auto industry leaders and other industry officials on a semiconductor shortage that has cut production, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.\n* No price target increases today, technical issue on our end :(\n\n\u201cIn my view, the biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.
