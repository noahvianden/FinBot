DO NOT TRY TO EARN IT BACK AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE -ODDS SAY YOU WON'T SUCCEED!\n\nI believe it is extremely important after a disastrous loss, to not repeat the mistake.... because, why risk the rest of your assets on similarly volatile plays? \n\nYou walked away with a [expensive] lesson learned... Hell I've been there and done that. Now, in the time it takes to build your account back up you are awarded real-world experience stripes, and an opportunity to actually LEARN about markets and trading strategies.\n\nI have been trading on the market for years, and I would like to point out one of my greatest regrets: not investing in ARKK because when it was mentioned to me it was trading at only $20. But it's not too late, because as great funds do, it will continue to rise.\n\nIf you have lost half of your investment or more, that's got to be real tough to stomach. FOR YOUR FINANCIAL AND MENTAL HEALTH PLEASE SELL ASAP. TURN OFF THE APE BRAIN, AND SWITCH ON THE REASONABLE ADULT BRAIN. Now take a step back and bbrreeaatthh. Plan to write as much off on taxes as possible. Use the other half to recover your losses. ARK Invest offers a variety of ETFs. My personal favorite, ARKK has a track record of returning on investment to the tune of +30% quarterly. Even in the event of a dramatic market pullback, as happened last March, it can realistically return +100% on the year. <Batman voice> I believe in Catherine Wood.\n\nYou've learned to not put all your eggs in one basket, especially when the basket has holes in it, and is on fire. $BANG stocks should never have seen more than 10% of your net assets -jusy like a play at the casino shouldn't. But recovery, ALMOST guaranteed recovery, is not too far away with an ARK Invest basket. And do not sell for at least 1 year.... because when you turn this loss into a respectable profit, you don't want to lose that much of your well earned moneys to the tax man!\n\nOr, I guess, go ahead and put what you have left into another casino stock... because YOLO?\n\nThis is not, by any means, financial advice. This is what I believe would be my path to recovery, in a hypothetical scenario where I lose half my assets.\n\n[Disclosure] I did well with GME, AMC, KOSS -but in the last few years I have suffered what were, at the time, significant losses. Also, I do not own any ARK Invest ETFs, though I must admit half the time I'm just stealing plays from what they publish (shh... don't tell anyone).

Sometimes, it's more **efficient,** to drop the underlying investment and repurchase at a lower price point.

{"title": "Quite Possibly The Next Big Green Energy Stock To Rocket From Sub Penny Status - Carnegie Clean Energy - $CWGYF(CanWeGetYouFerraris?)", "selftext": "I've been following this company for a bit now and thought I would share what I've been seeing over the past few months because I know there are lots of people in here looking for new penny stocks to do some DD on and invest in.\n\nI'll get you started on this one.\n\nI initially found this ticker after buying some shares of Ocean Power Technologies (OPTT) in the Fall and wondering if there were any similar companies being publicly traded. They're called Carnegie Clean Energy, formerly known as Carnegie Wave Energy. They've been around since the 80's and have recently been through quite a shake up. In the late 2010's they finally got rid of their CEO who was raking in nearly a million dollars a year and bleeding the company dry while failing to deliver on company promises. They've since shifted their focus to perfecting their wave energy AI and Tech. They've been doing so well in that field that as of this past Fall they are in partnerships with Microsoft($MSFT) AND Hewlett Packard($HPE). Both companies awarded their work access to their AI and computing capabilities because they believe they are producing game changing technology.\n\nThey've also recently turned their Solar Micro-grid on which powers Australia's largest Naval Base. The Naval Base had been undergoing some important updates mandated by AUS and is now fully functional again and receiving energy from the Micro-grid, which is bringing fresh revenue streams to the company. Their Micro-grid is also part of their off shore energy project which takes ocean energy and turns it into electricity while ALSO desalinating the water and putting it through a reverse osmosis filter to be used for drinking water.\n\nThe shares are currently trading at .0025 (that's 2000 shares for 5 bucks), up from it's all time low of .0001 which it hit right before their solar grid went live and their quarterly report came out. See the report and other news here: [www.carnegiece.com/news](https://www.carnegiece.com/news)\n\nSince hitting it's all time low, it's volume has been spiking, breaking it's all time volume high several times in the past two weeks. Volume in the beginning of January was nearly non existent. Now it's trading in the millions on a daily basis and rising. From what I've seen on different stock forums and chats, it is mostly German investors that have been hopping on this stock so far, or at least there isn't much, if any, chatter about it on the American forums. I've seen some people write it off because of the large float, but peruse the trending penny stocks that have seen large leaps recently and you'll find several with floats larger than $CWGYF.\n\nThe rest of the DD is up to you. Personally I'll be joining the Germans on this boat as it looks like a well positioned Green Energy play that's just now emerging from the basement and opening the doors at the ground floor entry level. If you like green energy and also getting in on the ground floor, this one could be for you. A $5 dollar investment might turn into $1, but I think it's much more likely it will turn into $60+. Start with a number bigger than 5 and... well you get it.\n\nCarnegie Clean Energy, where they want to know, \"Can We Get You Ferraris?\" - $CWGYF\n\nNote: ALWAYS do your own DD.

{"title": "RIDE DD: Huge Upside", "selftext": "Hello all. I tried post this in WSB. They're wonky since the whole takeover attempt. I ended up posting to another subreddit r/thedailyDD and tried to crosspost it here. Apparantly, you can't do that. Anyway, here you go:\n\nDisclaimer: Not a financial advisor. The below is my opinion. Do your own due diligence.\n\nTLDR: RIDE is a no brainer. Beta production is coming online and should be ready by march (57 vehicles). Over 100,000 preorders. Money from government. Crayons on charts point up. Boom.\n\n**Who is RIDE**\n\nLordstown Motors Corp., an automotive company, develops, manufactures, and sells light duty electric trucks targeted for sale to fleet customers. It primarily develops Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck. Lordstown Motors Corp. was founded in 2019 and is based in Lordstown, Ohio.\n\n**Recent news to make you randy**\n\n[Lordstown Motors Corp. Advances to Next Stage in Department of Energy\u2019s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program Application](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lordstown-motors-corp-advances-next-123000404.html)\n\n[Lordstown Motors Surpasses 100,000 Pre-Orders for the Lordstown Endurance, First Full-Size, All-Electric Pickup Truck for Fleets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lordstown-motors-surpasses-100-000-124500104.html)\n\n[Camping World and Lordstown Motors Partner to Establish Nationwide EV Service Network; Announce Plans to Develop Electric Solutions for the RV Industry](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/camping-world-lordstown-motors-partner-144900203.html)\n\nTogether with these two tweets from Marcus Lemonis\n\n[Tweet 1](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1358979145515094020?s=20)\n\n[Tweet 2](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1358974185998008320?s=20)\n\n**What does all that mean?**\n\nThere is demand. There is cash with more cash coming from the government. There is celebrity investors pushing their products with skin in the game.\n\n**Is this company real? Nikola did bad things.**\n\nNikola scared a lot of you from these SPACs claiming EV offerings. I don't know why anyone believed in them when they had nothing from near day 1.\n\nBut Lordstown is differnent. Lordstown has a [$6 billion plant sold to them from GM for peanuts](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/business/gm-lordstown-plant-sale-electric-pickup/index.html), a town full of skilled workers eager to work, and partnering companies like [LG CHEM setting up shop next door](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/business/gm-lg-battery-plant-lordstown/index.html) to them to deliver batteries. Lordstown is real.\n\n**Something about crayons.**\n\nI found this on Stocktwits. Do what you will with it.\n\n(Apparently this subreddit doesn't allow images. The image showed a chart of RIDE about to bust put. We are in the middle of that price increase now).\n\nI will say that RIDE usually trades with WKHS. WKHS is now at (02/08/2020) at $39.65 while RIDE is at $27.40. The above chart suggests an imminent breakout.\n\n**What makes them different**\n\nTheir biggest angle is fleet focused solutions. These trucks are meant to address fleet problems. Secondly, they offer a hub motor solution. That means the motor is behind the rim of each wheel, giving the vehicle an all wheel drive versatility, and reducing the cost of maintenance. Why? Because if one motor goes bad, you just remove it and replace it. It's easy access and smaller (less cost).\n\n**Anything else besides a truck?**\n\nTwo other vehicles are being discussed. One, a [commercial van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) and the other, an electric RV (see tweets above).\n\n**What does your crystal ball tell you?**\n\nAbsolutely nothing. It's a dud. My gut, however, tells me RIDE is ready to pop. Too much money is in this and the company uses actual electric powered motors, and not the gravitation powered ones made famous by Nikola.\n\n**Catalysts**\n\nMarch will see [57 beta vehicles produced](https://gmauthority.com/blog/2021/01/lordstown-motors-to-start-building-beta-prototypes-of-endurance-pickup/). These will be used for crash tests and such, but more importantly, be sent to initial fleet customers for feedback.\n\nApril - ??? The Department of Energy will decide on the loan. I[t helps when you have a huge cheerleader in office (Tim Ryan).](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/lordstown-motors-is-riding-on-hopes-with-biden-and-ryan/ar-BB1dmEBd)\n\nSome time this year we'll see the EV RV and Van designs/concepts.\n\nSeptember The beginning of live production.\n\n**Price targets**\n\nUsing GM forward P/E and 4% margins on revenue, this stock will range between $33 and $198. The $198 assumes full capacity of 600,000 vehicles sold. $33 assumes the 100,000 vehicles sold yearly. I'm comfortable with $115 - $125.\n\n**Positions**\n\n300 shares averaged at $18.78\n\n5 04/16/2021 $25/$40 call debit spreads\n\nPS: Too many people complain \"I wish I knew before it popped! Wah!\" Well, here you go. Do your own due diligence, sack up, and get in if your balls didn't shrink from taking this decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPSS: This subreddit needs to ease some of it's rules.

Probably a year. Near term, this seems good for Lordstown. No monthly payments on debt, and wont need to pay cash later to settle the debt. \n\nBut the bank they get cash from is gonna naked short it to ensure the price falls and they get more shares than Lordstown thought they'd have to give out.

{"title": "Why $MOR is a high IQ play in 2021. BioTech, Cancer, Inflammatory Diseases. DD Inside. \ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "**Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.**\n\n**General:** \n\nDuring a pandemic both government spending and private investing lead to an increase in market value among the health and research sector. There are a lot of companies in those sectors that are worth investing in, but upon closer inspection, there\u2019s a subcategory that looks even more promising: Biotech. This branch combines both health and research. You might have heard the names of the most well-known representatives like Biontech and Pfizer. Both are playing an important role in the distribution of vaccines. But even seen independently of the current pandemic, Biotech will probably gain an indispensable status with regard to yet incurable diseases like cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. \n\n**Introducing MorphoSys:**\n\nMarket Cap: 3.759B\n\nMorphoSys is an important developer of biopharmaceutical drugs. The company focuses on cancer as well as inflammatory diseases. However, the company focuses not only on pharmaceutical research itself, but also on the development of intelligent solutions and infrastructure, a major advantage compared to f. e. Biontech, where the lack of those lead to a lot of critique and problems, in regards to the distribution of the vaccine. MorphoSys already has two approved products on the market and three proprietary antibodies. The company is broadly positioned with their technology platforms in the market and also licenses them out to academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies for research. Therefore MorphoSys is a multi-talented company that is both a software and a research company. In addition, MorphoSys already has approved compounds that provide the company with a financial cushion.\n\n**The numbers:**\n\nMorphoSys was able to show revenues of EUR 48.2M in the first half of 2019. However, this multiplied to EUR 269.7M in the first half of 2020. (These figures are in euros, as I took them from MorphoSys's German balance sheets). Losses turned from EUR -28.5M in the first half of 2019 to profits of EUR 179.8M in the first half of 2020.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMorphoSys is a heavily undervalued company right now. The approaches the company is taking are similar to those of its chinese counterpart Wuxi Biologics. MorphoSys owns software that combines research and development while contracting it out to others. In doing so, the company is one of very few others that is working on autoimmune/inflammatory diseases in addition to cancer, effectively covering a gap in the market and creating a unique selling point.\n\n**Positions**:\n\n2 @ 95,84\u20ac\n\n**TL;DR:** German-American biotech company goes stonks \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "lhn7uf", "created_utc": 1613057837.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "I'ma invest just because I have an IBD", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.44140592217445374}, {"body": "Why TF aren't this banned ?

{"title": "DD: Missed TSMC? My bull case for Shin-Etsu.", "selftext": "Intro: Over the past few months, there have been an increasing number of posts discussing the semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry. The TLDR for these posts is that the big winner here is going to be TSMC. TSMC is the leading chip foundry in the world. It produces chips for Intel, AMD, Apple, and many others. \n\nMy thesis: The chip shortage is already priced into the current value of TSMC. I still have 9 shares of TSM, but I am going long on those. This is a shorter term play based off of the ongoing automotive semiconductor shortage. TSMC sources it's wafers from 5 suppliers, 4 of which are publicly traded. These companies are F.K.S., MEMC, S.E.H., Siltronic, SUMCO. These 5 companies produce 85% of the worlds raw wafers. Shin-Etsu produces 33% of the worlds wafers. Shin-Etsu is also positioning itself to be one of the primary producers of the chips that are invloved in the automotive industry shortage. In addition, Shin-Etsu is one of TSMC's primary suppliers of Photoresist. Finally, Shin-Etsu is based in Taiwan, TSMC is fully aware of this and is taking full advantage of the logistics advantages associated with Shin-Etsu's geographical position. \nTLDR: I think that SHECY is going to see a rapids spike in the next 6 months.\nPosition: 7 Shares SHECY @42.91 \nAdding more with my next paycheck, tax return, and stimulus.

But recovery, ALMOST guaranteed recovery, is not too far away with an ARK Invest basket. And do not sell for at least 1 year.... because when you turn this loss into a respectable profit, you don't want to lose that much of your well earned moneys to the tax man!\n\nOr, I guess, go ahead and put what you have left into another casino stock... because YOLO?\n\nThis is not, by any means, financial advice. This is what I believe would be my path to recovery, in a hypothetical scenario where I lose half my assets.\n\n[Disclosure] I did well with GME, AMC, KOSS -but in the last few years I have suffered what were, at the time, significant losses. Also, I do not own any ARK Invest ETFs, though I must admit half the time I'm just stealing plays from what they publish (shh... don't tell anyone). I point out ARK because I can't think of a better investment for beginners that has such amazing returns, and future potential.

Yes -I'd hit it, all while asking for investment advice.\n2. I agree, but sometimes averaging down isn't the best strategy. I averaged down today on Qualcomm after picking it up on discount after hours the other day -I thought that was **efficient**. Sometimes, it's more **efficient,** to drop the underlying investment and repurchase at a lower price point. In the case of GME, sell now and buy back 2-3x as many (probably more if you use the capital to earn in the meantime), You ultimately see a return on your assets in the form of asset multiplication, and then the multiplied gains you get when you reach your PT.\n3. I agree. It was to be the most EPIC squeeze ever. I lost a giant chunk of my gains too because I held 50% of my position into Thursday. But the fact is that it might have been such an epic squeeze they had to hit the brakes and minimize it... they realized that not only would the greedy, shit for brain, motherfucking, cocksucking, POS institutes get fucked, but also the millions of people for whom they control retirement savings, etc. The lesser of two evils was to save the thousands of millions of 401Ks and IRAs and shit.

{"title": "Quite Possibly The Next Big Green Energy Stock To Rocket From Sub Penny Status - Carnegie Clean Energy - $CWGYF(CanWeGetYouFerraris?)", "selftext": "I've been following this company for a bit now and thought I would share what I've been seeing over the past few months because I know there are lots of people in here looking for new penny stocks to do some DD on and invest in.\n\nI'll get you started on this one.\n\nI initially found this ticker after buying some shares of Ocean Power Technologies (OPTT) in the Fall and wondering if there were any similar companies being publicly traded. They're called Carnegie Clean Energy, formerly known as Carnegie Wave Energy. They've been around since the 80's and have recently been through quite a shake up. In the late 2010's they finally got rid of their CEO who was raking in nearly a million dollars a year and bleeding the company dry while failing to deliver on company promises. They've since shifted their focus to perfecting their wave energy AI and Tech. They've been doing so well in that field that as of this past Fall they are in partnerships with Microsoft($MSFT) AND Hewlett Packard($HPE). Both companies awarded their work access to their AI and computing capabilities because they believe they are producing game changing technology.\n\nThey've also recently turned their Solar Micro-grid on which powers Australia's largest Naval Base. The Naval Base had been undergoing some important updates mandated by AUS and is now fully functional again and receiving energy from the Micro-grid, which is bringing fresh revenue streams to the company. Their Micro-grid is also part of their off shore energy project which takes ocean energy and turns it into electricity while ALSO desalinating the water and putting it through a reverse osmosis filter to be used for drinking water.\n\nThe shares are currently trading at .0025 (that's 2000 shares for 5 bucks), up from it's all time low of .0001 which it hit right before their solar grid went live and their quarterly report came out. See the report and other news here: [www.carnegiece.com/news](https://www.carnegiece.com/news)\n\nSince hitting it's all time low, it's volume has been spiking, breaking it's all time volume high several times in the past two weeks. Volume in the beginning of January was nearly non existent. Now it's trading in the millions on a daily basis and rising. From what I've seen on different stock forums and chats, it is mostly German investors that have been hopping on this stock so far, or at least there isn't much, if any, chatter about it on the American forums. I've seen some people write it off because of the large float, but peruse the trending penny stocks that have seen large leaps recently and you'll find several with floats larger than $CWGYF.\n\nThe rest of the DD is up to you. Personally I'll be joining the Germans on this boat as it looks like a well positioned Green Energy play that's just now emerging from the basement and opening the doors at the ground floor entry level. If you like green energy and also getting in on the ground floor, this one could be for you. A $5 dollar investment might turn into $1, but I think it's much more likely it will turn into $60+. Start with a number bigger than 5 and... well you get it.\n\nCarnegie Clean Energy, where they want to know, \"Can We Get You Ferraris?\" - $CWGYF\n\nNote: ALWAYS do your own DD.

{"title": "RIDE DD: Huge Upside", "selftext": "Hello all. I tried post this in WSB. They're wonky since the whole takeover attempt. I ended up posting to another subreddit r/thedailyDD and tried to crosspost it here. Apparantly, you can't do that. Anyway, here you go:\n\nDisclaimer: Not a financial advisor. The below is my opinion. Do your own due diligence.\n\nTLDR: RIDE is a no brainer. Beta production is coming online and should be ready by march (57 vehicles). Over 100,000 preorders. Money from government. Crayons on charts point up. Boom.\n\n**Who is RIDE**\n\nLordstown Motors Corp., an automotive company, develops, manufactures, and sells light duty electric trucks targeted for sale to fleet customers. It primarily develops Endurance, an electric full-size pickup truck. Lordstown Motors Corp. was founded in 2019 and is based in Lordstown, Ohio.\n\n**Recent news to make you randy**\n\n[Lordstown Motors Corp. Advances to Next Stage in Department of Energy\u2019s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program Application](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lordstown-motors-corp-advances-next-123000404.html)\n\n[Lordstown Motors Surpasses 100,000 Pre-Orders for the Lordstown Endurance, First Full-Size, All-Electric Pickup Truck for Fleets](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lordstown-motors-surpasses-100-000-124500104.html)\n\n[Camping World and Lordstown Motors Partner to Establish Nationwide EV Service Network; Announce Plans to Develop Electric Solutions for the RV Industry](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/camping-world-lordstown-motors-partner-144900203.html)\n\nTogether with these two tweets from Marcus Lemonis\n\n[Tweet 1](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1358979145515094020?s=20)\n\n[Tweet 2](https://twitter.com/marcuslemonis/status/1358974185998008320?s=20)\n\n**What does all that mean?**\n\nThere is demand. There is cash with more cash coming from the government. There is celebrity investors pushing their products with skin in the game.\n\n**Is this company real? Nikola did bad things.**\n\nNikola scared a lot of you from these SPACs claiming EV offerings. I don't know why anyone believed in them when they had nothing from near day 1.\n\nBut Lordstown is differnent. Lordstown has a [$6 billion plant sold to them from GM for peanuts](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/08/business/gm-lordstown-plant-sale-electric-pickup/index.html), a town full of skilled workers eager to work, and partnering companies like [LG CHEM setting up shop next door](https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/business/gm-lg-battery-plant-lordstown/index.html) to them to deliver batteries. Lordstown is real.\n\n**Something about crayons.**\n\nI found this on Stocktwits. Do what you will with it.\n\n(Apparently this subreddit doesn't allow images. The image showed a chart of RIDE about to bust put. We are in the middle of that price increase now).\n\nI will say that RIDE usually trades with WKHS. WKHS is now at (02/08/2020) at $39.65 while RIDE is at $27.40. The above chart suggests an imminent breakout.\n\n**What makes them different**\n\nTheir biggest angle is fleet focused solutions. These trucks are meant to address fleet problems. Secondly, they offer a hub motor solution. That means the motor is behind the rim of each wheel, giving the vehicle an all wheel drive versatility, and reducing the cost of maintenance. Why? Because if one motor goes bad, you just remove it and replace it. It's easy access and smaller (less cost).\n\n**Anything else besides a truck?**\n\nTwo other vehicles are being discussed. One, a [commercial van](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131108_lordstown-electric-van-lg-chem-batteries-endurance-pickup) and the other, an electric RV (see tweets above).\n\n**What does your crystal ball tell you?**\n\nAbsolutely nothing. It's a dud. My gut, however, tells me RIDE is ready to pop.

{"title": "Why $MOR is a high IQ play in 2021. BioTech, Cancer, Inflammatory Diseases. DD Inside. \ud83d\ude80", "selftext": "**Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.**\n\n**General:** \n\nDuring a pandemic both government spending and private investing lead to an increase in market value among the health and research sector. There are a lot of companies in those sectors that are worth investing in, but upon closer inspection, there\u2019s a subcategory that looks even more promising: Biotech. This branch combines both health and research. You might have heard the names of the most well-known representatives like Biontech and Pfizer. Both are playing an important role in the distribution of vaccines. But even seen independently of the current pandemic, Biotech will probably gain an indispensable status with regard to yet incurable diseases like cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. \n\n**Introducing MorphoSys:**\n\nMarket Cap: 3.759B\n\nMorphoSys is an important developer of biopharmaceutical drugs. The company focuses on cancer as well as inflammatory diseases. However, the company focuses not only on pharmaceutical research itself, but also on the development of intelligent solutions and infrastructure, a major advantage compared to f. e. Biontech, where the lack of those lead to a lot of critique and problems, in regards to the distribution of the vaccine. MorphoSys already has two approved products on the market and three proprietary antibodies. The company is broadly positioned with their technology platforms in the market and also licenses them out to academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies for research. Therefore MorphoSys is a multi-talented company that is both a software and a research company. In addition, MorphoSys already has approved compounds that provide the company with a financial cushion.\n\n**The numbers:**\n\nMorphoSys was able to show revenues of EUR 48.2M in the first half of 2019. However, this multiplied to EUR 269.7M in the first half of 2020. (These figures are in euros, as I took them from MorphoSys's German balance sheets). Losses turned from EUR -28.5M in the first half of 2019 to profits of EUR 179.8M in the first half of 2020.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nMorphoSys is a heavily undervalued company right now. The approaches the company is taking are similar to those of its chinese counterpart Wuxi Biologics. MorphoSys owns software that combines research and development while contracting it out to others. In doing so, the company is one of very few others that is working on autoimmune/inflammatory diseases in addition to cancer, effectively covering a gap in the market and creating a unique selling point.\n\n**Positions**:\n\n2 @ 95,84\u20ac\n\n**TL;DR:** German-American biotech company goes stonks \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "lhn7uf", "created_utc": 1613057837.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "I'ma invest just because I have an IBD", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.44140592217445374}, {"body": "Why TF aren't this banned ?

{"title": "DD: Missed TSMC? My bull case for Shin-Etsu.", "selftext": "Intro: Over the past few months, there have been an increasing number of posts discussing the semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry. The TLDR for these posts is that the big winner here is going to be TSMC. TSMC is the leading chip foundry in the world. It produces chips for Intel, AMD, Apple, and many others. \n\nMy thesis: The chip shortage is already priced into the current value of TSMC. I still have 9 shares of TSM, but I am going long on those. This is a shorter term play based off of the ongoing automotive semiconductor shortage. TSMC sources it's wafers from 5 suppliers, 4 of which are publicly traded. These companies are F.K.S., MEMC, S.E.H., Siltronic, SUMCO. These 5 companies produce 85% of the worlds raw wafers. Shin-Etsu produces 33% of the worlds wafers. Shin-Etsu is also positioning itself to be one of the primary producers of the chips that are invloved in the automotive industry shortage. In addition, Shin-Etsu is one of TSMC's primary suppliers of Photoresist. Finally, Shin-Etsu is based in Taiwan, TSMC is fully aware of this and is taking full advantage of the logistics advantages associated with Shin-Etsu's geographical position. \nTLDR: I think that SHECY is going to see a rapids spike in the next 6 months.\nPosition: 7 Shares SHECY @42.91 \nAdding more with my next paycheck, tax return, and stimulus.

They are first foundry that will manufacture 3nm chips starting from 2022 (entire 3nm production is already booked out by Apple btw), their new foundry in Arizona will go into production in 2024 (I\u2019m speculating that this foundry will be serving mainly American based car companies, Tesla for instance is another important partner for TSMC. Currently they are supplying car companies with 7nm chips, the Arizona hub will be specialising in 5nm process ), and more importantly they just signed agreement to manufacture micro LED for Apple wearables (which means that their are diversifying their business model). As long as they can keep milking Moore\u2019s Law and diversify their business they have a long bull run ahead of them.\n\nAlso, if you really want to play the semi shortage game, companies like AMAT will be more profitable bet.

In other words, their margins on semis are really solid.
