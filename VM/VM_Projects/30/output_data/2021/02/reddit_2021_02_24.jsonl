{"title": "Journey to $1 Million - February 23nd, 2021", "selftext": "That was one of the most nerve racking trading sessions, leading up to the Fed speech. I was down 11% at one point and was thinking that I'd consider myself lucky if I can get out of today with only a 5% loss. The loss of $7450 for the options is a little misleading because that is including some \"insurance\" gamma hedges that I expected to drop if there was a correction. I bought two, one for XLK 332DTE and one for SMH 332DTE since my portfolio is heavy in tech and semiconductors. I'd still recommend longing those sectors right now during this dip. \n\n*I am being as transparent as possible. I'm will not hide losses and only show the victories.* \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r0ev4ecl9cj61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e82eaf3c7ec82e9e2e46352221a4d9dfa024515\n\n Positions Filled: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7dl479am9cj61.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=36e5915e6117b25650f7c96dd7b7e5c9019952cd\n\n Orders Cancelled: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/auytt19n9cj61.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=1166652669780116ee183be1d8d457571967c85d\n\nMy plan of action was to close out some backwards options positions that were short - mid term. The thought was if the market continues down or sideways for the remainder of the week, these positions would be more backwards in 3-7 days. I raised the capital and moved it over to long term hedges on the XLK and SMH as well as dollar cost averaging into more of my long term plays - specifically ARK LEAPS. \n\nARK ETFs are down almost 10% this week so far. They had two hard hit days. I am doubling down and lowering my cost basis. If you are in $PLTR or $TSLA, I'd consider doing it to, although Tesla did rebound quite nicely. \n\nI'll be updating my official watch list this weekend, but if you want to bargain hunt, now is the time. I'd recommend dollar cost averaging into your more important positions that are long term holds. Cut your short term options and roll them out when the market shows signs of life again.

They raise rates to do this.  Yes it hurts the economy but that is the point because inflation is usually caused by the economy being too strong.

The problem is that parts of the economy are doing very well while others are not and low interest rates aren't helping the parts that aren't doing well just the stock market and the parts that are fine.

That would involve raising rates relatively high and I don't see that happening.  Normal is considered around 3% so if inflation were really bad and they wanted to cool the economy they would raise rates above that.  Right now rates are near 0 because they are trying to encourage growth  (but the worst hurt parts of the economy are not being helped the most since it is small businesses and main street that are being hurt but wall street is the ones making the most off the lower rates).  If inflation were to start spiking the Fed would raise rates to stop encouraging growth but not high enough to actually try to hinder it.  However the market is high on the cheap money right now and would react poorly to a more normalized environment as  you have mentioned the expectation is that rates are gong to stay near zero for the foreseeable future.  Even raising rates to 1% would not be welcomed due to the expectations that rates are going to stay near zero for a while.\n\nInflation would be worse than raising interest rates.  Inflation makes everything more expensive which both raises costs of goods and also can reduce demand  as the buying power of consumers diminishes so hits the economy from both supply and demand sides if it gets too high.\n\nRaising rates a percent or two wouldn't really be doing damage to the economy, it would just be removing the existing stimulus and forcing the economy to recover at a slower pace, but since that is not expected, that is not priced into the market.  The market (not the economy specifically) tends to dramatically overreact to interest rates  going up especially if those rates are not priced in.  So normally the Fed wants to raise rates slowly with a lot of warning (several quarters) before it happens so as to not spook the markets but if inflation starts to grow to fast the odds are the Fed will act quickly to slow it especially since the historically low rates are the cause.\n\nThis wouldn't necessarily be that bad except that the market is considered overvalued by many and if rates go up it could be the spark to start a major correction.  Some might argue that a market correction is needed due to the idea it is overvalued and has gotten so far ahead of the actual economy and so it wouldn't be the worse thing that could happen.

{"title": "$SCR - Everything you need to know about this company before their IPO to the NASDAQ", "selftext": "I'll start by providing a chronological history of the company, then I'll explain the three pillars of Score Media and Gaming which drive the company today and some further context.\n\nTheir History:\n\n* 1993 - They launched SportScope, a Canadian TV channel with a sports ticker/scroll banner at the bottom.\n* 1997 - SportScope morphs into Headline Sports.\n* 2000 - Headline Sports morphs into \"the Score Television Network\".\n* 2007 - theScore is the first multisport news and data app launched on Apple App Store.\n* 2011 - theScore established itself as market leader in the mobile sports coverage space with 1 million active users.\n* 2012 - theScore Inc is created after theScore sells its TV company \"theScore Television Network\" to  Rogers Communications.\n* 2015 - theScore creates its eSports platform on YouTube.\n* 2019 - They partner with Bet.Works to create betting backend technology. They launch sports betting in New Jersey in partnership with Monmouth Racetrack, becoming the first and only US media company to create and operate a mobile sportsbook. They also enter into a strategic multi-State market access partnership with Penn National Gaming\n* 2020 - They launch sports betting in Colorado and Indiana and up list from TSXV to TSX.\n* 2021 - They've launched in Iowa and have announced their IPO for the NASDAQ. They stated that there will be more state expansions to come this year for theScore Bet.\n\n**The three pillars**\n\n*theScore*\n\n* theScore app is one of the most popular mobile sports apps in North America, ranking 3rd in North America and in Canada among multi-sport news and data applications. In Canada, theScore app had approximately double the users of its closest competitors, TSN and Sportsnet, and approximately ten times the users of ESPN\u2019s app.\n* theScore app generated approximately 3.7 billion user sessions over the last year, with average monthly sessions per active user growing at approximately 9% from 2016 to present.\n* Users of theScore app engaged with the application for approximately 101 minutes per month on average, ranking first among their peers\n* Their user chat features are very popular, particularly among users focused on sports betting, with approximately 48% of users who chat sending betting-related messages, and approximately 40% of their overall monthly active users consuming public chat content.\n* They recently announced their all time record in revenue generated from ads in their app.\n\n*theScore esports*\n\n* theScore esports produces and shares original videocontent pieces across its web and social platforms, including features and documentaries on high-profile teams, games and players from across the world of esports, as well as highlights and interviews. theScore esports\u2019 video content is distributed across YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok.\n* They have approximately 1.6 million subscribers to their YouTube channel.\n* 1.1 million followers on TikTok as of Dec 2020\n* Their esports video content generated approximately 357 million views across all channels during the three-month period which ended November 30, 2020. Representing a 358% year-over-year growth in total views of their esports video content from the same period last year.\n* Worldwide, it's estimated that 495 million people watched esports online or on television in 2020, and that viewership could grow up to 646 million people annually by 2023. As a result of growth of interest in younger generations of sports fans, it is estimated that esports will become one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long-term.\n\n*theScore Bet*\n\n* theScore Bet is authorized to provide sports betting services in New Jersey, Colorado, Indiana, and in Iowa. They also have market access for up to nine additional states via their multi-state market access agreements with Penn National Gaming\n* theScore Bet has market access to operate an online casino in New Jersey via a multi-year agreement with Twin River Worldwide Holdings, Inc. and anticipates launching its product in the state in the second half of calendar 2021. This is important because\n* Approximately 50% of users of theScore Bet on iOS devices are also users of theScore app, engaging with their content and their integrated media and betting ecosystem. This means that because they already have the userbase through their media that they don't have to spend as much on marketing compared to their competitors.\n* The total online gross gaming revenue generated in the United States is estimated to reach approximately $18 billion, of which approximately $6.4 billion is estimated to be generated in the states covered by their market access agreements.\n\n**Further Context:**\n\nCanada is on the brink of legalizing single event sports betting through bill C-218. It passed the 2nd reading by a vote of 303 and 15. It's estimated that wagering will begin by September (Start of the NFL). This is important for thescore because of their strong Canadian user base.\n\nOn February 11 2021 theScore completed a 10-1 share consolidation for the purpose of up-listing to the NASDAQ. They announced their IPO this week ~~and several sources indicate that their pricing will take place tomorrow. Usually the stock starts trading 1 day after the pricing, therefore it will start trading on the NASDAQ on Friday. I expect to receive an official statement from theScore tomorrow.~~ The stock will trade under SCR on the TSX and the NAS.\n\nThe two key factors to their success as a betting company will rely strongly on the integrations between their media and betting platforms which no other company can compete with and their massive user base from their sports media app converting to bettors. As I stated above, almost 50% of the users who chat via their media app also bet.\n\nSCR'S market cap currently sits at 1.64B, in comparison DKNG sits at 23.61B and PENN sits at 18.69.\n\nThis shows the kind of opportunity that theScore has and the unique position that it is placed in.\n\nEDIT: theScore [announced](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thescore-announces-pricing-upsized-initial-010000199.html) that they will be trading on the NASDAQ as of FEBRUARY 25.

{"title": "TSLA Bull Thesis and Valuation: projecting a 3-10x return by 2030", "selftext": ">***tl;dr, notable points and changes since last update lower down***\n\nHey all, here's my Tesla (TSLA) Valuation Model, up until 2030:\n\n# [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LTTs-bd2svqbbrIwk123-qmSEv35jhgRRWhSQlkB78M/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LTTs-bd2svqbbrIwk123-qmSEv35jhgRRWhSQlkB78M/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThis model provides data including and excluding Autonomous MaaS (AMaaS) revenue, allowing for comparison of potential outcomes dependant on whether full Autonomy is achieved and marketable as a Robotaxi program in the next decade.\n\nI believe that this model is relatively conservative in both financial calculations and production growth predictions. This is in comparison to predictions and statements by Tesla, their representatives and many buy-side analysts, namely ARK Invest, Baron Funds, Loup Ventures and Piper Sandler.\n\n\\-----------------------------\n\ntl;dr:\n\n2030 predictions excluding AMaas: $2634 share price from $572B revenue, $179B profit, $3.4T market cap\n\n2030 predictions including AMaas: $7299 share price from $1.1T revenue, $448B profit, $9.6T market cap\n\nmajor notes:\n\n* based on average 100kW/vehicle; predictions infer 1.12TWh battery capacity utilised 2030 (including 0.420TWh allocated to energy products), this is less than half of Tesla's stated goal of 3TWh 2030\n* in 2018, Toyota sold \\~10m vehicles at \\~25k ASP; my 2030 projection of 14m at $30k seems realistic when taking into account inflation and their diverse mix of higher ASP vehicles (Roadster, Semi, etc.). The ASP for all new light vehicles in the US for 2019 was $36k\n* predicted long-term auto production growth is 35-40% yoy, Musk stated in Q2 '20 earnings call that he expects YOY Auto growth of 50-100% for several years, with a long-term goal of 20mil vehicles/year\n* Solar/Storage prices and margins infer that Tesla will lower prices consistently while maintaining conservatively low margins of 5-15%\n* AMaaS release 5yrs behind Musk's original timeline. % AMaaS vehicles on network and hrs/week could be 2-3x realistically once safety and owner profitability has been proven\n* comparing EV/EBIT and P/S ratios to similar growth companies and the total market in general (as of Feb20, pre-COVID) portrays the predicted 2030 valuations as relatively logical for a fast-growing blue chip company\n* vehicle and energy production costs (and thus gross margins) have been modelled in line with Wright's Law; prices have been modelled to steadily decline with costs - alternatively, Tesla could maintain prices and allow their margins to increase much faster\n\n\\^these points and many others are further explained within the Notes section of the spreadsheet\n\n*Changes to model since October:*\u00a0slightly adjusted Auto, Energy and AMaaS predictions; added a Software tab; updated 2020 numbers from Q4 update; increased valuation multiples due to updates from highly-regarded bank analysts; added heaps of detail and other points of interest to the Notes section.\n\n***-----------------------------***\n\nIn closing, I've a current buy-price target of **USD$985**, with the expectation for that to\u00a0increase **roughly 2.6x\u00a0to $2634**\u00a0by 2030 excluding revenue from AMaaS. I do expect a much larger return than this in the long-term, however this would be the lowest return I'd be comfortable with. Including AMaaS and Software projections, my model results in a 2030 price of\u00a0**$7299**. Keep in mind that the entirety of my model is quite conservative when compared to other investors and analysts that actually get paid to do this. For comparison, Alex Potter from Piper Sandler has a 2021 buy-price target of $1200, and\u00a0Ark Invest have a 2024 price target of $1400-3000, versus my $1400. Ark Invest have publicly stated since Battery Day that they'll be publishing an updated model to include announcements from Battery Day that will be increasingly bullish. **My model predicts a conservative 3-10x return in 9 years from today's closing price of $698.**\n\n*I of course must also say that I have no idea what I'm talking about and that you should take everything in these spreadsheets with a mouthful of salt water, making no investment decisions based on me nor my numbers.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*^(funding secured)*", "id": "lr6tqb", "created_utc": 1614152149.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "Hell yes, it's bullish.

{"title": "Lucid merger", "selftext": "Anyone been following the Lucid merger the past few days?

I initially bought my first round of CCIV when it was only $14.60, and prior to merger DA I was sitting on 2,300 shares at $20 average buy.\n\nPost-merger the stock collapsed due to the \"buy the rumor sell the news\" crowd who just wanted to profit off the swing and walk away. But I truly envision this as a solid bet for the future of EV that will rival Tesla in the years to come. They have a better/more efficient modular battery tech that resulted in 6 different auto companies seeking deals from Lucid. Formula E cars use Lucid tech instead of Tesla simply because it performs better. The Saudis have a majority stake in the company, and know that EV is the future and will fully support Lucid (they're working to build another factory in the Saudi Peninsula, btw). And with a recent injection of $4.5 billion from this merger, it's absolutely mind-blowing to see this stock at about $28/share.\n\nHence, even post-DA, I bought more and am sitting on 4,000 shares at a $26 average buy.
