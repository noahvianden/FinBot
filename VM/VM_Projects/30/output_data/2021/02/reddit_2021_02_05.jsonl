{"title": "I want to invest in 5G, should I join Motley Fool Market Pass?", "selftext": "Hello, I have recently gotten into learning about stock trading, probably the hardest I've tried learning anything in my life.\n\nYes, GME is what pulled me into this world in the first place. But I do not think I will be investing into GME now (it looks like I would have had to do that a year or two ago to have gotten a huge return this year, like DeepF\\*\\*\\*ingValue.\n\nBut, I figured it'd be worth it to try and learn about the stock market and invest the traditional way. Yes, slow growth insanely infuriates me (I'm a 25 year old and feel my whole life has been a waste, and not looking forward to decades more of misery, and/or the traditional work until 60 or 70 and then retire path) but 5G is going to be a MASSIVE gamechanger.\n\nI personally believe in it (I LOVE self driving cars and AI, I'm a HUGE fan of these things) and 2021 has just started, and Apple has already released a 5G iPhone, the iPhone 12. But the massive life and societal transform of 5G hasn't even begun.\n\nI want to make up for my lost youth (\\*sigh\\*, even if the money won't come in until my 30s, maybe I can somehow make the best of it until then, I don't know, I have a lot of issues and circumstances straining my life) and also prove to my family that I CAN be successful. I don't want my two options to be live with them forever or end up homeless. \n\nI don't have real time to get myself set up for a career, I'm losing my health insurance in a year. I can try to get some better entry level job that provides that, I guess. I do desperately want out of this house. But I need my own stability. \n\nAlso, if I get rich, I can give to the poor, which will give my life meaning, like Mr. Beast.\n\nI don't need to profit as much as possible. I'd keep $10-$20 million MINIMUM to my name at all times if I made it that high (for security against inflation and economic crash coming) and give wealth to those suffering, the homeless, young adults whose parents kept them in the house and not let them go get a job, I'd give them a nice 5 or 6 figure to get out and go live.\n\nI realize I'm shooting high, but I'm (not rock bottom, yet) very low, so why wouldn't I reach high?\n\n5G is a HUGE opportunity, and I'm a big believer in advancing technology. I'm NOTHING like my family, I'm VERY pro-technology and pro-technology.\n\nI do want to enjoy my own wealth, but to ALSO share it. I believe everyone should receive a basic living allowance, while I may not be able to do that, I could certainly give to those in dire need if I was a multimillionaire, definitely as a multibillionaire.\n\nThis isn't JUST about me, but others, especially those worse off than me. The world owes me nothing, and I owe nobody else anything? Screw that rule, I feel it is my responsibility to get rich and give to others, it will also mean my life has a purpose.\n\nAlternatively, even not getting rich, but more in the thousands, could still mean pursuing higher education, affording my healthcare, and paying bills and rent more easily to transition to my full financial independence (above poverty).\n\nI realize my wording may seem kind of odd, but I'm trying my best to type out how I feel.\n\nI already spent $430.84 for \\*Stock Advisor\\* and \\*Rule Breaker\\*, so they are giving me a discount (they apply credit you already spent to discount another subscription). Instead of $999 for \\*Market Pass\\* it will be $571.70. \n\nYes, I don't make a lot ($1,200 a month, or less) but I'm desperate to achieve financial independence, and might not have much time to do so (lots of instability and dysfunction at home). I'm also just ready to get a f\\*cking life and enjoy it after 25 years of being miserable. I don't want to rely on poverty or welfare programs or whatever, if I'll even qualify for that. I'm very determined to not have to suffer anymore years. Especially since I could lose insurance to pay for my medications after this year.\n\nI certainly feel I'm better off spending hundreds, even thousands, investing into stocks that will bring me wealth, than spending it all on the lottery, because that was becoming my next plan before I feel my only option left is to, end my life.", "id": "ldi5a9", "created_utc": 1612561549.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.46, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor stock recommendations please see our portfolio sticky, sort by hot, it's the first sticky, or see [past portfolio stickies here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22Rate+My+Portfolio%22+-+r%2FStocks+Quarterly+Thread&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

While some people may find other people\u2019s financial loss somewhat entertaining, I want to emphasize behind every \u201closs porn\u201d, stood a real person. I hope everyone who lost recently will find better luck in the future and know that at end of the day, you can always make these money back so long you are healthy and alive! \n\nThat said, the group think that had led up to the bubble and burst of meme stocks (in particular, GME) has left me baffled about the deceptive nature that has motivated people into holding a clearly losing position.\n\n\u201cSunken Cost\u201d fallacy aside, the idea that if you keep buying or holding stocks like GME will make the rich bleed is frankly bizarre. Sure, some big player like Melvin capital got burned, but please understand that they aren\u2019t the only player or HF in Wall Street (on the contrast, they are more akin to a small fish in a big sea). In reality, a lot of HFs don\u2019t profit from directional trades (long or short a stock), but rather, profits are made from longing or shorting the stock\u2019s Volatility (hence why more HFs actually made a killing from their Straddle positions - feel free to look up what that means). Trying to convince other people to dump their life savings into a volatile play like GME with the argument that it\u2019ll help bankrupt the rich cannot be further from the truth. \n\nI know I\u2019ll get downvoted for saying this but I\u2019m just shattered from seeing people losing their life savings while believing this is somehow doing a good deed. I pray that a miracle happens and GME will bounce back soon on a catalyst so at least those who lost everything can get a chance to recover. But please, before the meaningless shills, do some research about the basics of how hedge funds work and the economy in general before convincing others that it\u2019s ok to lose money in a gamble like this. \n\nGood luck to all!", "id": "lcykl7", "created_utc": 1612496504.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "i understand but sir... this is a casino", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Schedule D of your tax return.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.002919358666986227}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0}, {"body": "Feels like people are just drinking coolaid..", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08188558369874954}, {"body": "Church?

Peloton has been up pretty high during covid. So right now, you would expect them to have high cash flow and good fundamentals. \n\nThe supply issues, given there that a lot more people are interested due to covid, they need to convert as many of those people to users as quickly as possible, so supply constraints are going to hit harder than you might expect for apple or nvidia.\n\nWhich brings up the question, why is there such a time constraint? Peloton, like many companies, has benefited greatly with people working from home much more than ever before. That being said, there is a huge open question as to whether that will continue after COVID, and whether when people begin to be able to do more outside and in public, will they continue to buy the service? With the vaccine now in distribution and production, there is basically a time limit on how much more benefit Peloton will have from COVID effects, and if people do not receive their bikes before the vaccine is widely distributed, will they cancel orders? Will they continue to subscribe?\n\nWhen you think about apple or Nvidia, there may be supply constraints, but everyone is still going to want the latest iPhone even if they have to wait 2 months. The people who are buying the highest-end graphics cards are not suddenly going to stop wanting/needing them, so there isn't as much concern for those stocks.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Fair point, I can respect that.

The flu is very similar to COVID in that we do see yearly mutations and have to adjust vaccines every year accordingly. I would say the more likely expectation is that COVID does stay around, causes a few thousand or ten thousand deaths each year and we accept it. I mean, the US didn't start wearing masks after some large flu seasons with 80,000 deaths (potentially twice as large as \"normal\"), and so to think that a few thousand more deaths each year from covid will result in a fundamental shift is somewhat na\u00efve (IMO). \n\nThis is obviously a pretty callous response, but think about something like seatbelts. Car manufacturers put alert sensors for the front seats and not the back seats. This isn't because sensors for the back seats would not save lives, but rather the cost is higher than the benefit of the lives saved, and no one really makes much of a fuss.\n\nI don't mean to say there will not be SOME permanent effects, but there is a very large open question as to the extent of those changes, and some of those changes may have unknown effects. For instance, right now people are working from home and going out to eat less. Even if we expect more WFH after covid, that could actually end up increasing social spending in restaurants and activities. People who WFH may be more likely to go out and do activities in order to get social interaction that they otherwise may have gotten in the office.\n\nEdit: I do want to clarify, I think there is potentially some upside long term for peloton if certain things happen.

{"title": "Now that we have 8.6 million degens here it\u2019s time to discuss the bull case for my favorite stock.... NIO", "selftext": "Chinese Tesla has treated me extremely well this year and I\u2019m PROMISING you guys that we will see growth to 100 per share before the end of the year. \n\nMy bull case....\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEV craze has just begun. The world is slowly integrating itself into a place devoid of combustion engines. As much as I love the sound and performance of a combustion engine I just don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be around for to much longer. With that, integration of a green new deal will completely change the US regulatory systems regarding emissions. The Green New Deal is a congressional resolution that lays out a grand plan for tackling climate change.\n\nIntroduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, the proposal calls on the federal government to wean the United States from fossil fuels and curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions across the economy. It also aims to guarantee new high-paying jobs in clean energy industries.\n\nThat beings said, trade tariffs will be decreased under Biden with China. This will allow for easier Chinese exports of cars, such as vehicles from nio, to be introduced to the United States.\n\nChinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025. \n\nDeliveries have been insanely good. Breaking records in a constant uptrend for the past year.... they\u2019re aiming for 120000 deliveries in 2021 which is 274% greater than this year\u2019s 43,728 deliveries. \n\nThey\u2019ve integrated some of the best new tech into new vehicles including... the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin\u2122 system-on-a-chip (SoC) for its new generation of electric vehicles, which will offer advanced automated driving capabilities.\n\nNIO is working to make consumer adoption of smart, performance-packed electric vehicles a widespread reality. At NIO Day, the company\u2019s annual customer event, the EV maker revealed its NVIDIA DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer, dubbed Adam, which will first appear in the ET7 sedan that will ship in China starting in 2022. NIO was the first to put the 1,000km range on its ET7 sedan specification, to be fitted with a 150kWh solid-state battery when it goes into production in 2022. This KILLS TESLA. \n\nCameras also kill Tesla....NIO Aquila Super Sensing features 33 high-performance sensing units including an ultralong-range high-resolution LiDAR, 11 8MP high-resolution cameras, enhanced driver monitoring system, 5 millimeter wave radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors, redundant high-precision localization units and V2X.

{"title": "Moving on to better stonks... $AMD back on the menu, boys.", "selftext": "Hi retards, \n\nI've had my laughs from the GME pump and dump, trying to get back to making money now. Anyone still chanting diamond hands while they cry, fully clothed, in their parent's master bath tub while licking a photo a KFC bucket is officially excluded from this discussion. \n\nI have been on $AMD since around mid-2017, when the Ryzen hype was getting started (who the fuck you think started it). Let me tell you why now is actually a decent time to get involved: \n\n1. You're retarded, and financial strategy isn't your strength the way eating a jar of mayonnaise is. \n2. AMD has done everything they ever said they were going to do, including snatching the crown for single threaded performance from Intel. \n3. AMD's desktop, server, and mobile CPUs are industry leading products that are being sold above the MSRP for the first time in my memory. \n4. AMD's GPU lineup is more scarce than even NVIDIA's stuff (Performance in gaming is a wash)\n5. AMD is currently valued \\~$100 billion\n6. AMD became profitable about a year ago, and wall street has been waiting for the other shoe to drop, but LISA FUCKING SU NEVER TAKES HER SHOES OFF. Pretty sure mama su bae sleeps in a pantsuit. \n\nSo, it seems like you missed out, huh? Feeling a little down and out? Your wife's boyfriend ate all your popsicles?\n\nGood news. Gospel, really. AMD's run is only half over. The other players in the space ($NVDA and $INTC) are both losing market share to AMD at a rapid rate. The thing is, due to legacy machines existing, and old people thinking computers run on ravioli, almost none of the market has made a CPU purchase until NOW. \n\nI'm talking about schools, corporations, POS, all that shit. Server farms. Government offices. They're all still running legacy Intel chips from 2012. Anyway, just saying that the growth (astonishing rate of 45% YoY for like 3 years) that $AMD has seen in revenue and EPS - that growth - will continue, and might actually accelerate this quarter, definitely going to pump after Q2 ER. \n\nJust look at the market cap of Intel ($260 billion last I gave a flying fuck). AMD is a more valuable company long term. They make better products. They attract better talent. They are smarter about who they work with (they were the first major partner of TSMC, now APPLE and INTEL are trying to squeeze in and suck the tit). They love enthusiasts. They are agile. \n\nAnd they are at the tippity top of the mountain, but they're only half way up. Think about it. \n\nI won't stop betting on AMD until their market cap is AT LEAST 50% of INTC. should be around $120 per share. My position is almost all shares right now, with a lonely $95 call expiring 3/12. Gonna give him some friends pretty soon.   \n\n\nGood luck out there, and for fuck's sake stop circle jerking to your GME loss porn.
