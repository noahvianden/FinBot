{"title": "Help needed.... Robinhood Wash Sale Computation", "selftext": "I started options trading last year. I just received my 1099 from Robinhood today and was surprised to see a ton of wash sales computed for weird reasons:\n\n*  For my positions that I opened for a given stock, if I didn't close them all at ones, the subsequent closes ending up or expiring at a loss, those are marked as wash sales.\n\nEg: \n\nLet's say I opened 2 contracts SPY 350C at 10/10, closed each one at a different times. The first one with a loss of $100 and the second one with a loss of $150, the $150 is marked as wash.\n\nThe 1099 marks the date acquired as various, when it was all acquired at the same date.\n\n* For option spreads I've opened and closed, it reported all of the losing side as wash while adding all of the winning side as capital gain. WTF is even this?\n\nEg:\n\nLet's say I opened a TSLA 425/430 call debit spread and closed it for a profit (closed both legs together), it reported all of the gains for the 425C long leg while marking all of the losses from the 430C short leg as wash.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis has added up to over 25K in wash sales over the past year when my gain shows 15K. Can someone tell me if:\n\n1. I can deduct these wash sales off my filing, because most of these don't make sense at all? 90% of the 25k wash is from the closure of the spreads and closing of options at different dates.\n2.

[The IRS has rules](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1092) that limit deducting losses on straddles. Basically, when you exit an offsetting contract at a loss, the loss is deferred to the extent you still have unrealized gains. You would be eligible to claim the loss when selling the remaining position in the underlying. Simply being long the stock could be an offsetting position (even in a different account, and taking the wash sale rule into account, even in an IRA -- never trade the same security in both taxable and non-taxable accounts unless you **really** know what you're doing). It probably shouldn't be reported as a wash sale though, because it's actually a Sec 1092 deferral. Either way, brokers are generally not required to apply the Sec 1092 rules -- the onus is on the taxpayer to do that. So if you're trading options and filing your own taxes, you need to learn Sec 1092 and how to report G/L adjustments on your 8949.\n\nOne workaround is to completely exit an underlying for more than 30 days spanning the end of the year.

I bought 2 options for $60 ($120 total) then added 2 more for $40 ($80 total), and then I added 1 more for $35. My 5 total contracts bought added up to a total of $235. These options weren\u2019t doing so well, so I ended up selling all 5 options for $10 each ($50 total). My 1099 showed: total proceeds = $50, total cost basis= $285, Total wash disallowed= $50, and my net (loss/gain) = -$185. So my net loss was accurate. -$235 + $50 = -$185. They added the wash to cost basis I think, and then the final math took it out again. So the wash sale gets canceled out in the math. Either way, my net loss/gain ended up being accurate.

{"title": "Why UAVS is the play of a lifetime", "selftext": "UPDATE: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ageagle-aerial-systems-responds-false-130500072.html\n\n+25% premarket. There is still time to get in if I\u2019m being honest \n\n\nMost of you who are reading this have probably never heard of the American drone company AgEagle Aerial Systems (ticker $UAVS) and a few of you probably have. I have been following the company for over a year and will give you the scoop of what\u2019s going on:\n\nBackground on the company: UAVS specializes in agricultural mapping and has recently shifted to the drone package delivery sector (see recent partnership with Valqari , a company which specializes in drone delivery solutions): [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/15/2109196/0/en/AgEagle-Aerial-Systems-Partners-with-Valqari-to-Manufacture-Drone-Delivery-Stations.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/10/15/2109196/0/en/AgEagle-Aerial-Systems-Partners-with-Valqari-to-Manufacture-Drone-Delivery-Stations.html)\n\nThis partnership with Valqiri along with a partnership with \u201cmajor e-commerce\u201d platform that they cannot disclose due to an NDA has led to UAVS running up from $2 to an ATH of $17.68 in the span of 6 months.\n\n**Now for the REALLY juicy part.** Today a ragtag short activist by the name of Bonita Research released a hit piece on the company with some blatantly false information which caused uninformed investors to panic sell **causing $UAVS fall of 40% in an hour**. Here is a link to the hit piece which I will debunk below : [https://www.bonitasresearch.com/](https://www.bonitasresearch.com/)\n\n**background on:** Bonitas Research is a 'short activist' who frequently posts bogus short attack pieces and invokes the first amendment whenever they are sued by the companies they attack for their absurd claims.\n\n**Debunking their report:**\n\nFor starters they begin the report by listing UAVS on the COMPLETELY WRONG EXCHANGE (NASDAQ instead of NYSE). They then go on to accuse the company of being a pump and dump with the catalyst being an unofficial YouTube video that supposedly HINTED at a partnership between UAVS and Amazon. THIS OCCURED 10 MONTHS AGO. Yes you read that correctly. They then go on to say \u201cwe have found no evidence of any major e-commerce customer or drone technology credited to AgEagle\u201d. **However you can explicitly find evidence of the major ecommerce partnership in the SEC filings of AgEagle:**\n\n\\*\\*\"\\*\\*In the third quarter of 2019, AgEagle announced that it had begun to actively pursue expansion opportunities within the emerging Drone Logistics and Transportation market and revealed that it had received its first purchase orders from a major ecommerce company to manufacture and assemble UAVs designed to meet the critical specifications for drones that are meant to carry packaged goods in urban and suburban areas\"\n\nSource (From AgEagle's 10-Q filed 11/13/20): [https://sec.report/Document/0001575705-20-000242/](https://sec.report/Document/0001575705-20-000242/)\n\nThis major ecommerce partnership extends well into 2021 for reference and they have seen immense growth since the partnership.\n\nThe Bonitas hit piece reads like it was written by a fifth grader who just discovered WSB but it has caused uninformed investors to panic sell. As soon as these claims are addressed by AgEagle (most likely today) and when others who are privy to the company call out the 'report' (if you can even call it that) for its BS, those who panic sold will get right back in. It is already climbing back up after AH (+**3.57%** at the time of this post) and I don't see it going back down to the extent that it has in the future. I don't post here often but I view this as a literal once in a lifetime opportunity given the nature of the situation. I am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

{"title": "(2/18) Thursday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News", "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Thursday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Thursday, February 18, 2021-\n\n*****\n\n# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-18-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Dow set to drop as Walmart declines on disappointing earnings\n\n> * U.S. stock futures fell Thursday, after Dow stock Walmart dropped 4.5% in the premarket on disappointing earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday erased a 180-point loss and ended 90 points higher for another record close. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed slightly lower for the second straight session. The S&P 500 pared losses after minutes from the Fed\u2019s last meeting signaled easy monetary policy for longer with the economy nowhere close to pre-coronavirus levels.\n\n> * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly jobless claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell. Economists expect 773,000 new filings for unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 20,000 from 793,000 initial claims the prior week, which saw little relief from declining Covid cases.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. Walmart missed on earnings, beat on revenue; CEO to boost wages\n\n> * Trying to turn pandemic gains into sustained momentum and higher profitability, Walmart on Thursday before-the-bell reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.39 per share, which fell short of estimates. Revenue grew by 7.3% to a better-than-expected $152.1 billion. The big-box retailer\u2019s e-commerce sales in the U.S. grew by 69% and its same-store sales in the U.S. grew by 8.6%. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company will boost the wage of U.S. workers, raising the average for hourly employees to above $15 per hour.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. What to expect from GameStop hearing with Robinhood, Citadel, Reddit CEOs\n\n> * The heads of Robinhood, Reddit, Citadel and Melvin Capital, will be in Washington for Thursday\u2019s highly anticipated GameStop hearing, which is scheduled to begin at noon ET in the House Financial Services Committee. According to prepared remarks, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman will testify that no significant activity on WallStreetBets last month was driven by bots or foreign agents. Keith Gill, the Reddit and YouTube trading star known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d will defend his social media posts that helped spark a mania in GameStop shares.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. How Texas power grid failed and what could stop it from happening again\n\n> * More than 500,000 households in Texas are still without power Thursday morning, according to poweroutage.us, following Sunday night\u2019s historic cold and snow that caused the state\u2019s worst blackouts in decades. Millions of people were in the dark at the height of the crisis, which was caused by a confluence of factors. Officials are already calling for investigations. Experts said there are a number of steps that Texas can take to combat future problems, including weatherizing equipment and increasing the amount of excess supply needed to meet peak power demand.\n\n*****\n\n> # 5. U.S. life expectancy drops a year in pandemic, most since WWII\n\n> * Life expectancy in the U.S. dropped a staggering one year during the first half of 2020 as the pandemic caused the first wave of coronavirus deaths. Minorities suffered the biggest impact, with Black Americans losing nearly three years and Hispanics, nearly two years, according to preliminary estimates Thursday from the CDC. \u201cYou have to go back to World War II, the 1940s, to find a decline like this,\u201d said Robert Anderson, who oversees the numbers for the CDC. It\u2019s already known that 2020 was the deadliest year in U.S. history, with deaths topping 3 million for the first time.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/FrLUO2J.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8MNKhv6.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/T3cRcfQL/econcal1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/15wRfpqK/econcal2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wWv2RIG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/968QLzv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/03Kxnx1.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.postimg.cc/TP8PttvF/eram0111.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/eg2VEbG.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/DfgMUm2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/AlgBlru.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/ozc7nge.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/sfSCc3gj/upgradesdowngrades1.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/VvjyLWVr/upgradesdowngrades2.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/FKuhY48.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/OLqGg4c.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/sQzqUDu.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/sWm5TFN.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-premarket-walmart-hormel-foods-marriott-others.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Walmart (WMT)** \u2013 Walmart reported adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.39 per share, which includes a 7-cent impact from UK tax repayment.

{"title": "DD on DG - DOLLAR GENERAL Earnings Play 3/12", "selftext": "Alright retards, let's talk about your favorite one stop shop for when you yolo your inheritances and students loans on meme stonks at the top. I'd like to preface this by saying that I am an analyst, but a really shitty one, and not in finance.\n\n**I bring to you: DOLLAR GENERAL**\n\nAside from the fact that it has exceeded earnings the last 4 quarters, there is a run up trend for at least the past three (Q3, Q2, Q1 2020) right before earnings with a dump immediately after. This falls in line with most earnings plays right now as well (see Disney clowns, Palantards, AMDeeznuts, bla bla). I don't have any astrology charts, I ate the crayons.\n\nThe company's financials seem solid and this seems like a recession-proof play that will either provide good tendies or food stamps (no Dollar General snackers here).\n\n**Beer Case:**\n\nCompetition - Walmart, Costco... okay, cool. From what I know, I feel like Walmart and Dollar General are a different kind of shopping and Walmart is usually more inconvenient to get to than DG, usually on the outskirts of cities and in the suburbs (could be wrong). Costco is definitely a threat but requires memberships. Welcome to accept argument on this.\n\nBoomer stock - Yes, I am aware. However, so is AT&T and tendies were made on that.\n\nMarket having gone full retard - I would say buyer beware but you retards are at a kindergarten reading level.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nSomeone else wrote a DD on this before, but their positions are likely bust and I'm not sure why they didn't buy in for AFTER earnings.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nMay hit, IDK.\n\n**Positions:**\n\n10 $210C 3/12\n\n**FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT DRAWN OUT - PLAY THE RUN UP, SELL DAY BEFORE EARNINGS...**", "id": "lmxf09", "created_utc": 1613682793.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "Consider this DD: \n\nThere\u2019s a Dollar General about 1/2 mile from my house.
