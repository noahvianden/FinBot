They haven't released the christmas sales informations, what they usually do. My guess is they will either do it soon or keep them for earnings.\n\nChrismas must have been absolut gigantic for Papa Bezos.

Q4 2019 disrupted the stock and pushed it 8% higher and the surprice was only 60%. If you take the 200% Growth YoY Q4 it would surprise by 300% which could lead to absolute new ATHs.\n\nMy estimate: 150% YoY Q4, which bringt earnings to **16,175 EPS and a surprise of 232%**(!!!!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: BUY AMAZON!

{"title": "OAC \u2013 A Sleeping Giant. Kylie Jenner promoted their product her Instagram", "selftext": "  \n\nOkay, I admit, I originally dismissed this stock because of the terrible DD\u2019s previously posted about this. OAC is a blank cheque company that will be merging with HIMS & HERS.\n\nA lot of the other DD\u2019s have mistakenly categorized HIMS as a company that specializes in selling erectile disfunction pills, which ironically, I found as a turn off and dismissed it completely. However, I decided to give this company a second look because of the recent price action on the stock and what I found was a sleeping giant in the making. Yes, it\u2019s true that they do sell \u2018boner pills\u2019, but that\u2019s just one product among many others (i.e. hair loss treatment, birth control, acne, etc.). What caught my attention wasn\u2019t what they were selling, but HOW they were selling it. Take Amazon for example, which was a company that sold books originally, and expanded into other products as it grew. What made Amazon successful wasn\u2019t what they were selling, but HOW they were selling it. \n\nHIMS is looking to position themselves as a Telehealth disruptor in the Healthcare space. How they are unique from any other e-commerce platform that simply sells medication is the fact that they have a unique network of physicians that will address consumer concerns. For example, a person that has concerns about their hair loss might be too self-conscious to go into a doctor\u2019s office to get a prescription and then must take that prescription to get fulfilled at a pharmacy. The whole process is embarrassing and intimidating, and as a result, the customer might just not seek a solution all together. However, with HIMS, the customer can consult a doctor remotely, get a prescription, order his medication, and have it delivered to him all through his phone and in the comfort of his own home. This in a nutshell is what give HIMS their unique competitive advantage. \n\nWhat really attracted me to HIMS were their financials. The company has been in operation for 3 years and the company is almost generating net positive EBITDA and will be in the next year or two (think about what happened to $SNAP when they were finally able to turn a profit and the stock price blew up). In their latest S4 Amendment, it shows their Q3 results in 2020 vs. their Q3 results in 2019. They were able to generate almost twice as much Revenue (from $57 Million into $107 Million) and was able to reduce their marketing expense (from $49 million into $39 million) at the same time. Not only that, but they were also able to increase their gross margins from 51% into 72%. As a result of their increased revenue, gross margins and decrease marketing expense, they were able to improve their EBITDA by $49 Million Year over year in 2020. They will mostly likely be EBITDA positive in 2021 when they finish their merger with OAC. Keep in mind that the company is only 3 years old and still have lots and lots of run room. Their growth potential is exponential. \n\nSo far, I have demonstrated that the company has an amazing business model and amazing financials, but what about their social media presence? The HIMS account has 99.9K followers and the HERS account has 100K followers, for a total combined following of 199.9K followers. Their closet competitor is Lemonaid Health, and they only have a total combined following of 8.3K. So clearly HIMS has a lot more social influence than their competitor and once again keep in mind the company is only 3 years old. Having a strong social media influence is part of the reason why they were able to generate more revenue while spending less in marketing in the year of 2020. Most recently, Kylie Jenner (The world\u2019s youngest self-made billionaire with 208m followers on Instagram) posted an Instagram story of her buying HERS product and tagging Jennifer Lopez (who is a primary business partner and investor of HIMS & HERS). Having strong social media influencers like Kylie Jenner and Jennifer Lopez allows HIMS & HERS to bypass and save money on traditional marketing (like billboards and magazines) and allows the company to directly advertise to their primary target market (a generation of users that prioritize their mental and physical health, and prefer to conduct their business online)\n\nSo, they have a great business model, financials, and social media presence, but what about their management team and investors? Andrew Dudum, is the CEO of HIMS & HERS, but before that he was the co-found of ATOMIC, a company that specializes in start-up. The guy literately started a start-up company that focuses on start-ups. This means he knows a thing or two about company valuations and reaching out to venture capitalist to generate funding and increase valuations. As a result, he was able to receive funding from notable investors such as Peter Theil (the guy that invested in FB, PLTR, and many other blow out companies in the early stages).\n\nOkay, so the company has a great business model, financials, social media and leadership, but how much can I expect on my return on investment? The OAC merger gives HIMS a valuation of $1.6 Billion at $10 per share. Currently OAC is trading at around $15, which gives HIMS an implied valuation that is greater than $2 Billion now. However, the CEO, Andrew Dudum, is suggesting the company has a potential to reach $20 Billion, which is a 10X bagger from $15 to $150 per share in the future after the merger. The merger with OAC is expected to be completed by the end of January, afterwards the ticker symbol will start trading as HIMS.\n\nPosition: 1K shares\n\nTLDR: OAC Merging with HIMS - The company has a great business model, financials, social media presence, leadership team, and future valuation. Merger expected to be completed by end of month.\n\nEdit: proof of OAC position https://imgur.com/gallery/D3rn6ZS\n\nEdit 2: Adding \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 for dramatic effect \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "kuletk", "created_utc": 1610308197.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Post a dickpic while you're at it...please", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "After use of HIMS product", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04094347357749939}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11682070791721344}, {"body": "Here you go! https://imgur.com/gallery/D3rn6ZS", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Spoiler alert.
