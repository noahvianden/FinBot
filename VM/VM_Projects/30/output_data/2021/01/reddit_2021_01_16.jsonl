{"title": "CMPS / Compass Pathways DD - largest of the shroom stocks", "selftext": "**Overview**\n\nCompass Pathways PLC is a British company studying synthetic psilocybin as a treatment for depression.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nCMPS is addressing several mental health diseases. There are ongoing trials for anorexia nervosa, addiction (primarily alcohol and smoking), depression, and anxiety. The global TAM for depression and anxiety alone is estimated at $18.5b. The most successful antidepressant at present is Zoloft, and it has generated over $30b in total revenue for Pfizer.\n\nCMPS is the largest of the psychedelic pharmaceutical companies by a significant margin with a market cap of almost $1.53b (only MindMed also breaks $1b). They are also currently listed on the Nasdaq. While psilocybin research has increased significantly, they are the dominant player in this space. They now run all six registered clinical trials for psilocybin that are industry supported.\n\nAs with all the players in this space, there are concerns about IP protections and the defensibility of their position. CMPS was granted a patent (US Patent No 10,519,175) in Jan 2020 for the use of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. This patent covered their proprietary, synthetic version of psilocybin (called COMP360). The primary purpose of the patent was to protect a stable form of psilocybin for clinical use. Otherwise, you would be stuck with a product with limited shelf life and significant variability in dosing. This patent is significant because it fulfills the FDA\u2019s \u201cgood manufacturing practice\u201d standards required to get final approval for any drug.\n\nPhase 1 trials for psilocybin are (by and large) completed. A 25mg one-time dose has been well-tolerated in several trials (in a typical 70kg subject). This has allowed for progression to Phase 2 trials. Clinical efficacy trials are starting to get published. The highest-profile study yet is Davis *et al.* **2020** JAMA Psych, wherein they found significant benefit to psilocybin use in conjunction with therapy when treating depression (trial: NCT03181529) (1).\n\nComp360 is in Phase 2b trials (NCT03775200 for an initial trial and NCT04519957 for long-term follow up) with a recruitment goal of 216 subjects. The Phase 2b trial is projected to finish recruitment in May 2021 and completed in Dec 2021. Depending on how the data look in May, they could begin working on Phase 3 approval through the FDA shortly after that. The primary question is how large a trial (i.e., how many subjects) will they need for Phase 3? This gets at the efficacy and number needed to treat to see a benefit (number needed to treat/NNT). The closest analog for investigational psychedelics is esketamine (aka Spravato). While ketamine has use as an anesthetic, its use in mental health was controversial (2). There were multiple analyses of the data (3\u20135), but the most important thing to know is that psilocybin has both a greater and a more durable antidepressant than esketamine (6\u20138). It stands to reason that the size of their Phase 3 will be smaller than the esketamine/Spravato trial and will proceed more quickly. Regardless, the timeline for that is still on the order of years.\n\nThe political climate is improving for psilocybin. Oregon and DC have recently voted to decriminalize it. In contrast with LSD, there is significantly more will to study therapeutic uses of psilocybin, and some reputable US universities (NYU, JHU) are leading these efforts.\n\nDifferences from the marijuana industry: An understandable comparison has to be made to the marijuana bubble. There are several key differences between the two markets:\n\n* Higher barrier to entry.\n* Lower recreational demand.\n* Ability to learn from marijuana stock euphoria.\n\n**Dilution rounds/Convertible debt situation:** CMPS has been through two rounds of funding and an IPO. Series A and B raised $105m in capital (Series B in April 2020), followed by their IPO, which raised $146.6m. They\u2019re backed by ATIA Life Sciences who have raised $125m in November, and ATIA will be going through its own IPO sometime in 2021. Raising funds has not been an issue thus far and will get easier as trials are completed.\n\nDilution can be a significant hit to share price (ask MindMed holders). Looking through their F-1, on F23 (pg. 305), there are 116,455,234 shares worth of options and convertible preferred shares. There are 94,651,686 shares authorized. The F-1 has a section on dilution, but every pdf version available looks corrupted and there are missing values. Expect that any investment will be diluted at some point if the company is successful.\n\nAs a sidebar, Peter Thiel owns 7.54%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Outlook:**\n\nThe next major milestone for CMPS will be an interim report on their Phase 2b trial for Comp360. They have been enrolling patients for 12 months now. When looking at the change log on [clinicaltrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov), their initial goal was the complete the trial by Dec 2020, but this slipped to 2021. Their primary completion is now May 2021; this will be when they\u2019ve enrolled all the subjects. There may be some kind of press release at that point or even an announcement of a pre-IND call to the FDA to discuss Phase 3 plans.\n\nMy thesis is that the stock will continue to cool off from the ATH they hit in December. A 10q will come out in late February; they could potentially have an update on trial progress in it \u2013 there could also be an 8k. They will not disclose interim study results at that time. Their goal will be to wait for a splashy publication after the trial is done. The goal should be entry before then. Prior results are strong enough and consistent enough to have a favorable outlook on the trials.\n\nLonger-term, they will be administering a Phase 3 trial. Look for a recruitment goal of 1,000 or more subjects (it will be on the order of the Spravato/Esketamine trial, which had 816). Janssen Research moved Spravato rapidly through Phase 2 and 3 trials, and it still took them four years to do the entire Phase 3 alone. CMPS has been efficient thus far, but Janssen is a J&J subsidiary with significantly more funding. A full four-year cycle would be a reasonable estimate. But we will get a better idea when the Phase 2 is done since it is already large for a trial of this type. If they can recruit patients quickly, then their Phase 3 may be faster than Janssen\u2019s was for Spravato. CMPS also has the advantage of breakthrough therapy status with the FDA.\n\nAn all-important caveat to CMPS: this is a company with only one drug in the pipeline. If Comp360 has a negative trial outcome, then this stock will tank. There is no plan B. Administration of Comp360 is not as simple as getting a prescription and taking it at home. Patients have to be monitored by a specially trained therapist for >4 hours after administration. Even if there are significant benefits over the current therapies, clinical adoption will be slow.\n\nMy final TLDR: enter this play in the medium term after the current peak has wound down. CMPS is a better long-term hold that other players in this sector given the patentability of their therapeutic (Comp360) and success moving through trials. The science is on their side, and the political climate is more favorable than other psychedelics (e.g., LSD and MDMA).\n\nPositions: 4,000 shares, no options\n\nPapers\n\n1. A. K. Davis, F. S.
