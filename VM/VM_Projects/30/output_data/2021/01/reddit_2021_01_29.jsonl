{"title": "Why this time really could represent a historical, revolutionary week/s", "selftext": "Sorry - gotta kind of codify any of these hot-ticket names because understandably, theres been an increase in automodding for certain tickers etc...  \n\n\nI dont tend to try to explain my investment theories / strategies / ideas too much; Years back I really appreciated [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/) as I was learning and so to those, old and new, I feel like I have to say this.\n\nThe videogame store stock itself is unimportant (and i mean, ofc. It's fn a b+m business that sells digital content). So are any other tickers that are blowing up right now. What is important is that retail traders for the first time have actually had an effect on the market that was so significant that all the establishment basically had to go code brown and pull out their hail-mary's like completely blocking trading on the app they know is probably (actually, no, they (hedge funds etc.) know FOR SURE - because they've been buying robin hoods data). Shit that is in a super gray area legally and could EASILY be construed as clear market manipulation if you can prove some ties between RobinH and hedge funds, etc.\n\nThis isn't about M\\*\\*\\*n. This isnt about any short selling firm in general. They're a blip. What has Wall Street scared is that this is unprecedented and represents the \\*chance\\* for a change in power and influence over the market that has never been seen. Wall St fat cats have been making easy, safe money for years off the riskier trades of retail traders (or, I should say maybe, the inherently-more risky trades necessary when one doesnt have billions to work with). One, two, five hedge funds going out of business IS NOT THE CONCERN.\n\nTHIS IS THE CONCERN - We've been seeing a widening wealth gap and opportunity for income and social mobility has been shrinking and shrinking as a great divide has formed between the elite and the average person. Anyone with a brain knows that doesnt work for ever - at some point people dont have any more to give (or lose), people are out of patience, people get hungry, people get angry. That spread cannot continue. THIS MOVEMENT OF LETS GET TOGETHER AS RETAIL TRADERS, TALK TO EACH OTHER, REALIZE WE'RE ON THE SAME TEAM - that could be the GREAT EQUALIZER that we have been needing for years as the US economy becomes more and more slanted in one direction (ie, the mega-rich).\n\nTHAT, my friends, is why we've seen such a strong reaction. The system the elite has built is not made to handle the masses all uniting for a cause. Look, I know this might sound a bit extreme, but how do you think any civil (or not so civil) revolution has ever come about? It's the populace getting sick of the manipulation of the top minority and exercising the sheer force of their numbers.\n\nEven better, this is a war of DOLLARS not of knives, guns, and blood. The US military-industrial complex cant just stop this revolution. This has the potential to really, swiftly, re-distribute wealth in America based on MERIT rather than family history. The American dream is that this a meritocracy where those who think right and do shit right get ahead. Nothing about the G\\* short squeeze plan is stupid. But we saw serious resistance yesterday thanks to the actions of brokerages and the general wall street establishment.\n\nI know [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/) gets a lot more old school traders that have probably seen this or that fad come and go. I've been watching WSB and related stuff for a few years now thinking about what sort of power it could end up generating. We're getting the first glimpse.\n\nNot only do people with big positions kinda need this to not just fizzle out - we all need it to keep going because otherwise, the status quo will remain until it does come to some sort of violent revolution down the line. In the past 15 min I've seen articles from the likes of Mark Cuban basically saying the same thing.\n\nI'm not saying buy into G\\* - thats of course pretty crazy at $100+ a share, and that's your choice based on your risk tolerance and what part you want to play - but dont dismiss this and side with the establishment, because they're covering their asses. What I'm saying is that if, as the \"meme stocks\" start adding newer tickers to their lists based off what's closed, and the same shit keeps happening, I dont know what proof more you need that this IS IN FACT getting to the establishment. Or look at some hedge fund managers cry on the news about the damn kits on the internets. They are outdated. They're resting on their (not well-deserved) laurels. MONEY drives the modern world and has been the tool of the ruling elite for years. Even if nobody makes money on this shit, showing how superficial and stupid some of these constructs are - and how vulnerable to any coordination - is proving a very important point about the power of the people, thanks to online trading apps the the establishment themselves developed, thinking, \"Let's get more stupid retail traders for more dumb free money\".\n\nSo, in short - screw them. Whether here or ws bets, love your fellow retail traders and don't let this same shit that's been happening for years happen in such an extreme and obvious way. I dont have the total solution here - but we are on the brink of the possibility of a HUGE economic disruption that could turn the 1% into the 25% in a few weeks. That seem like a bull-case scenario for it? Sure. But it's not impossible. I just hope people understand the magnitude of this. It's definitely the biggest thing on the market since the housing crisis, and quite possibly the dot-com bubble or even the crash of 29. It's significant. Please dont just dismiss it as dumb kids on the meme-forum. Those dumb kids really caught on to something.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Sorry, mods, I'm definitely not trying to ask an FAQ nor get around spam filters.  If this does make it up and it is within guidelines I'd appreciate the obvious changes of tickers / names etc. to be changed back, but if not, I think everyone can figure out what G star might be, etc...

Suppose retards money costs 3% each year and stockholders get 20% of the borrow interests. Then retards pay 6% of the float cap each year and receive 6% each year. Retards may say retards do not receive this money but **Retards money has no cost per year.** And any hedge fund who is longing will get this for sure.\n\nNow, in this case, anyone who believes there be a 30% drop within 1 year will happy to borrow and short. However, everyone is willing to buy it as retards own it at no cost. Just another month\u2019s rent.\n\nThen, those are already shorting felt fuked. They are paying to short a company that never dips to \u201ctrue value\u201d in their mind. So they will buyback. Ironically, this short-sellers might just be buying another short-sellers' shorting share, so nothing changes or stocks go up.\n\nIn this case, the short sellers will be eaten up from the borrowing cost and have to buy in the end. Then, they have to buy from someone who is shorting, and they may want more shares than that, so they push up the price. Retards gained and do not incur any fees. Retards just watch them killing each other and push up the limit until someone broke and buying desperately. Then the stock will be pushed into the sky, and if retards never take profit, they can do nothing to retards! Retards still HOLD and incur no costs, like DFV, and only newer short-sellers suffer more and more. If the stock dips, retards will buy the dip and more short sellers will be fuked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If there are any limitations for buying stocks, retards never lose a stock as they are professional bag holders. After the ban, more retards will be flooded in and short sellers will die even worse.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTherefore, as long as retards are truly retarded, short sellers will die one by one. Retards can take profit sometimes, as long as retards buy the dip ( if retards sell at 400 today, retards will buy the dip using the profits. Leaving profit on the table is the least courtesy. so that retards are owning more and more shares, 20% float, 30% float, 40% float, and retards all disallow new shares to be offered and short-sellers are just dead like a dog.)", "id": "l7e1kr", "created_utc": 1611880583.0, "score": 216, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "Rip through a lot of short sellers pages.
