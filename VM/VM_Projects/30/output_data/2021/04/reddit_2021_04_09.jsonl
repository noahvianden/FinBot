[KKR Portfolio | KKR](https://www.kkr.com/businesses/kkr-portfolio)\n\n04/11 update... Just want to say I have reviewed the open interest in GME and my put spread will be exited early in the week. I believe in this: Move it lower, stir emotions, sell more puts,  close it around $170 at end of week and simply crush all those emotional options buyers.  The OI of puts $170 strike and lower is ridiculous against the call volumes. A big imbalance like this gives those that control the market a big incentive to park this GME around $170 at end of week. Of course, I can be wrong! However, I'm not greedy and am risk adverse. So, this idea makes most sense to me so I'm going to take profits on this put spread and then just watch the stock or day trade it the remainder of the week.\n\n04/12 TOOK OFF MY GME PUT SPREAD ... CHA CHING .. more than a double here. ASO ... again.. I'm going to sit on this for the retail numbers.  When I see GME -10% and see ASO holding up here .. feeling right about this call. My other play was a Put spread in RCL which I just cashed and I'm holding this put spread x 2 bought late last week .. MAR $148 , $138 spread and short shares at $147.97 ... Looking for a sub $146 print. MAR has been really trading light volume. The only way I think the volume is going to pick up is that the stock gets re-priced soon.\n\nFor short term price action uber-bullish I watch the 15 minute 13 period RSI for a print and hold of 69 mark.  It's always a sexy move it can hold 69. ASO just printed 68.82 on this indicator 9:27am. 12:11pm Now, 4th hit at this $31.70 level with a nice low volume draw down. $32.25 is a very key level and it is not far away. Higher high in price , Higher high in the RSI ... this feels explosive.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "mnq6er", "created_utc": 1618000821.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 40, "comments": [{"body": "One thing I did not note.

{"title": "Why it won't be all that hard to compete with Tesla", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I'm all in Tesla, even sold my share of real-estate and don't own one, and I'm quite biased toward Tesla. Also, my English sucks, please bear with that.\n\nI'm always think about threats to Tesla\\`s position as an industry leader so that I'm not blinded by the Holy Light Elon emits with all his ventures. So far I'm pretty assured Tesla will dominate for decades to go, they have everything what it takes.\n\nBut I found two important and bullish reasons why old car makers won't die as easily as some believe.\n\nThe main reason is based on the **80**\\-**20** rule:\n\n>What Is the 80-20 Rule?  \n>  \n>The 80-20 rule, also known as the [Pareto Principle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paretoprinciple.asp), is an aphorism which asserts that 80% of outcomes (or outputs) result from 20% of all causes (or inputs) for any given event. In business, a goal of the 80-20 rule is to identify inputs that are potentially the most productive and make them the priority.\n\nSo, based on this rule, you need to apply only 20% efforts compared to Tesla to make a product about 80% as good, as Tesla\\`s. I think all their products like Mustang, id3 and id4 and so on reflect that rule. Of course, Ford, VW and others never made all the efforts Tesla done, not even close, but they still producing vehicles which are good enough to capture part of the market.\n\nThe second argument is that EV's essentially easier to produce, thanks to it's simplicity compared to ICE. So, making the hardware is easy part. You don't have to make it as refined as Teslas. Just make that 20%-40% effort and the difference starts to washing out in the eyes of the consumers. The main hurdle isn't hardware at this point. It's the software and infrastructure, but 80-20 rule still in strength. I omit FSD here, because it's basically a whole new product and we are yet to see how it will be adopted.\n\n**TL;DR** Competition needs to apply only 20% effort to make 80% result using Teslas as 100%, which is enough to remain on market. Making EV's by far easier that ICE, so it won't be all that hard to make them from hardware stand point. This makes me think that old car makers have decent chances of survival, but sure, they will shrink and still have many hurdles to overcome despite 80-20 rule and simplicity of EV's.\n\nUPD: I'm sorry for bringing this topic up. I'm not omitting all the problems legacy automakers have to deal with in order to just survive. 80-20 rule actually proven countless times. But it works only if one is willing to achieve something. I think the main obstacle legacy facing is the lack of will, and that's what could kill them, not the complexity of transitioning itself.  \n\n\nUPD2: F it, I think I backfired myself by not making 20% efforts to translate my point properly.

{"title": "What will stop FSD/Level 5 systems from being a race to the bottom in autonomous taxi pricing/margins? My analysis on the future financial potential of autonomous taxis in general.", "selftext": "So a lot of Tesla's valuation is clearly FSD potential, but I generally see little analysis on how Tesla will be able to avoid a race to the bottom in pricing for autonomous taxis.  \n\nMy thoughts are this:  \n\n1. FSD is just software. It's not interactive software either. That is to say that if you put FSD in a Tesla, a Toyota, a Mercedes, and a Rolls Royce, there would be no apparent difference to the user in terms of functionality. It simply has one function: Get from A to B. There is no \"user experience\", so to say. It will be like doing a Google Search in Safari, Firefox, or Chrome. No difference really.  \n\n2. There really isn't much major software in the world that has functions/functionality truly unique to any one vendor. Autopilot stuff exists in Boeing and Airbus. Lambda- and ECS-like features exist for many cloud providers. Most software, even if it's launched by one company first, quickly has alternatives developed that do the same thing. This is especially true for software that is largely just a single function/purpose, like a print() method.  \n\n3. FSD/Level 5, once achieved, will generally stop improving as far as user perception is concerned. Transportation is just A to B. Once you do that, there's not much else to do. Maybe one will be slightly quicker at parking or a tiny bit better in some regards, but 5-10 years from now, if one company has solved it, many others will have as well. When it comes to hailing an autonomous taxi, it's highly unlikely that someone says, \"Oh, let's get that one instead because I heard it parks better.\" Max 777 jokes aside, passengers don't care about the avionics in a Boeing vs an Airbus, so why would they can about Tesla FSD vs non-Tesla FSD? They're just getting in a giant piece of metal to get from A to B while they use their phone or laptop.  \n\n4. If (1)-(3) are generally true, then it means a Tesla autonomous taxis and a Mercedes autonomous taxi for example will have to be differentiated by other things. The only likely difference will be cost, size, and comfort.  \nCost: People will decide which is better value, plain and simple.\nSize: You'll select the car you need based on what you need to carry/move. You won't get a small Tesla if you're 5 people and 8 suitcases, and you won't get a Mercedes Sprinter if you're one person going to work.  \nComfort: Purely discretionary. You might want a super comfy spacious S-Class and pay a premium for it. You might want a tiny 2 seater Smart-like car and get a discount for it. You might even want some sort of carpool Zoox thing with strangers.  \n\n5. Cost will be the only differentiator that a manufacturer can control to incentivize you. So let's assume someone wants a robotaxi. They want a simple sedan, nothing special, typical errand run. They can choose between a Model 3 and a Camry. Both have Level 5 functionality. What one will this person pick? Well, since they will both accomplish the goal of A to B, and let's say they're both immediately available, that means it will just come down to price. Why would you choose one over the other based on anything other than cost? Now it will just become a race to the bottom because the company with the lowest cost will get the fare. This has actually already played out in Uber/Lyft/Didi. Subsidize to the bottom.  \n\n6. There is always someone willing to accept lower margins. So even if Tesla has better margins at the same price, there will likely be someone willing to accept an even lower margin at a lower price. If the profitability potential of FSD/Level 5 will be so lucrative, it stands to reason people will be more than happy to accept less and still make a bunch of money.  \n\n7. Tesla's manufacturing cost advantage isn't significant over the revenue lifespan of an autonomous taxi. Let's say Tesla can make these cars for $5000 less than competitors. They can use that $5000 to subsidize rides and offer lowering price, but when you consider the lifespan of an autonomous car to be hundreds of thousands of miles over 10+ years, that $5000 amortized over the lifespan of the car/revenue becomes insignificant. At $1/mile over 500K miles, you'd be able to offer a savings of about 1%, or $.01/mile. That amount will be meaningless to a customer and they will revert back to simply: \"What is the closest car I can get into quickest?\" Maybe it will be a Tesla at $.99/mile, or maybe it will be a Toyota at $1/mile.  \n\n8. Regarding using customer cars as a fleet and taking a cut. If Tesla sets the price charge's $1/mile and takes a 30% cut, that means they have $.30/mile of possible subsidizing available and with no startup/overhead costs. However, the same thing as (7) happens. Toyota builds their own cars, keeps 100% of the money, and offers rides at $.60. And again, over the long-term, upfront costs of manufacturing the car are tiny compared to long-term revenues.  \n\n9. So what happens in the end? A race to the bottom. Not an unprofitable bottom, but a very low margin bottom. It's not like Apple vs Samsung. It's not like Google vs Bing. Why? Because taxi service is neither differentiated by interaction/UX (think iOS vs Android), nor by stickiness/first-move advantage since it costs actually money (not free, think Google vs Bing). The latter of those is particularly important in that first-mover/stickiness only happens due to parity pricing. That's to say that Apple can't just start charging $1/month for iMessage, even if they're the biggest/stickiest. People will just move to WhatsApp or other big messaging apps. The stickness depends on the \"free\" aspect. And when I say free, I mean non-currency payment. People don't care about their data, and they'll gladly trade you data for messaging, but they will not trade cold hard cash for messaging or picture posting.  \n\nSo that's a really long post and I'm tired of typing now ;)  This isn't a bull or bear thesis. This is just a thesis on FSD potential and whether it's bull or bear depends on how you value it in the first place, so I just flair it \"competition\".", "id": "mnpneu", "created_utc": 1617999254.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "I think in the end, once the market is saturated with robotaxis, the rates and margins will be low.

It's way more complicated than saying \"it's just software\".  Beyond that, FSD is actually not just software. It's a combination of hardware and software. There are cameras (8 total) and custom tesla chip to go along with the software. So even if it were just software.

I'd argue it's highly unlikely for any meaningfully unsafe autonomous vehicle to be allowed to operate. If FSD has competition, I believe it will have to be safe by law. I don't believe the safety would be allow to be meaningfully worse. Like most consumer products and services, everything will likely be safe enough that consumers don't care. This already exists in cars. Different cars have different crash ratings, but people generally don't care since all are more or less safe.  \n\nI think it's a mistake to compare FSD software to something like Google search software. A successful Google search is rarely absolute. It's very subjective and you almost always iterate (change words, word order, quotes around certain words, image search, reverse image search, site:, etc.) A Google search never fails, it never returns the wrong thing, but that doesn't necessarily determine whether you found what you wanted. Whether you find what you want or not is very subjective.  \n\nFSD/robotaxi success is much more specific since it's really only trying to do one thing: get from A to B. Did it get you from A to B? If so, pass. If not, fail.  \n\nSo, how could they be different such that people think Teslas are better? A few things:  \n\n1. Maybe Teslas are on average quicker from A to B. Could they be *that* much quicker? Not sure. Probably not.\n2. Maybe Teslas are smoother and less prone to weird motions/dynamics of the steering.  \n3. Maybe Teslas can get close to your destination on average by X meters. But would you know this in advance? Would you know whether a Tesla was better at a very specific place?  \n4. Maybe Teslas have been traffic/route planning. Seems unlikely given Google's mapping quality etc.  \n\nThere are definitely ways for Tesla to differentiate itself and display superior software, however, taxis are just so very simple. I believe that if a person needs a taxis, they will simply decide based on these far more than anything else:  \n\n1. Is it available? People will take what is available. They won't wait 10 minutes for a Tesla to pull up if a Toyota is right there already.  \n2. How much is it? They will not pay a huge premium for anything.  \n3. Will it get me close enough to where I'm going? They won't take a car that can't get them where they want, but they won't wait for a Tesla to pull up just to save them 30 seconds of walking from the corner to the doorstep.  \n\nEverything else I think would be very very very distance 4th+ criteria. As someone who spent years taking taxis and transit in major cities, I almost always just took what I could most quickly get. Unless I needed a very specific thing (van perhaps), the taxi I took was irrelevant. Camry? C class? VW? I've taken them all and I never cared what it was.

This is a huge first mover advantage for claim of market share.\n\n2. For a given battery capacity, Tesla's vehicles use far less energy than the competition. Less energy means a lower cost per mile to operate the robotaxis.\n\n3. More and more, Tesla is an energy provider, and through things like Autobidder, Powerpack, and solar, can further drive down the cost of their energy, which further lowers their cost per mile.\n\n4. Tesla has the Tesla Supercharger network, and can (in theory) charge the competition more to use them. Also, it will be important for robotaxis to charge quickly to minimize down time and maximize revenue.\n\n5. Tesla already has a rich entertainment suite (Netflix, games, etc.) in all of their cars, and that will only continue to expand as the robotaxi network becomes a reality, and provides a potential additional revenue stream as well which could afford them to lower their per mile price even further.\n\n6. The fact that Tesla can make their vehicles more cheaply actually is important. Higher cost can limit the pace of growth. If Tesla can make a robotaxi for $5,000 less than the competition and they are making 20M cars per year, that's a savings of $100B per year, which is enough for them to make another 5M robotaxis assuming a cost of $20k per car.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1. I believe others have competitive efficiencies, like Hyundai/Kia.  \n\n2.  The cost savings of say $5000 has to be amortized over the life of the car. So $5000 in savings spread out of 500K miles at $1/mile would be a cost savings of 1%, or $.01/mile. That wouldn't be enough of a savings to pass on to customers to make a difference in choice.\n\nManufacturing cost is rather irrelevant for such long life products and revenue streams.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Agreed, but it still puts Tesla at the top of the pack, and first mover advantage is really important as is evidenced by Uber and Lyft's dominance in the ride sharing business. Once people have a preferred service, they tend to stick with it. Also, the $5,000 savings thing is more important for the growth phase of the robotaxi network. It takes huge amounts of upfront capital to put millions of robotaxis on the road, especially for company owned robotaxis. One million company owned robotaxis would cost Tesla somewhere around $30B initially. If you can do that more cheaply than your competition, you will be able to grow faster, which only helps your first mover advantage that much more.\n\nTesla is also better positioned to scale a robotaxi network than the competition in other ways. Their vertical integration over their supply chain ensures that they have quick access to the materials they need to scale quickly, e.g., raw materials for batteries and FSD chips.\n\nI'm not saying there won't be competition. There will. But first mover advantage is very important in this case. From day 1, Tesla will have millions of robotaxis on the road, thanks to FSD being built into every car since October 2016, and it will be very hard for a competitor to break into that market. There's just no other company right now that could offer a cost competitive electric robotaxi network at scale right now, and by the time there is, they will have a massive uphill battle to break into the market.\n\nI say electric because a gas powered robotaxi could never compete on price with an electric car. Again, Tesla can charge at their own Superchargers at cost. Any competitor would need to pay consumer rates at a third party charging station, which at the moment are very expensive and much less available than Tesla's Supercharger network. This puts Tesla's electricity rate at probably half the competition. Gas cars would be a non-starter at about 4 times the cost of electricity per mile, not to mention the additional maintenance costs.

Google, Microsoft, etc all have absolutely insane cash flow and access to capital. Microsoft could probably borrow $100B tomorrow at something obscene like 2%.\n\nTesla does already have a lot of cars out there, but almost every single Tesla created right now is not viable for use since they are used largely by owners who always need them. You can't just take cars from people who didn't plan on that sort of ownership experience. Also, most are spread in suburbs where there is very little taxi demand anyway.  \n\nThe most important thing to realize IMO is that Tesla does not have a financial advantage and this is largely a financial investment (if you assume FSD exists for everyone). Tesla simply doesn't have much to invest compared to others. That may change, but if you flipped a FSD switch today, they'd be massively outgunned.  \n\nRegarding Uber first-mover thing though: Uber is not profitable, neither is Lyft, and Uber even sold out and left China because the two companies just more or less agreed that they couldn't compete profitably.

I would argue that an autonomous electric robotaxi has much higher barriers to entry, with the same as those with ride hailing businesses, but with the added barrier of actually building the technology to make FSD possible. Sure, eventually autonomous vehicle technology will be licensed out, but at a premium. Those who build in house will have a significant cost advantage. If you don't build the vehicles and/or the FSD technology in house, you'll never be able to compete with Tesla on price.

Tesla's plan to let owners add their cars to the robotaxi network is brilliant because it costs Tesla nothing. In fact, owners pay Tesla not only for the car, but for FSD and Supercharging as well.

Wanted to share some different dimensions of vols. If you're looking to collect theta on any of these names, hopefully these visuals can guide you towards the juicier strikes, and steer you away from the lower vol strikes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VIAC**\n\nAs some earlier threads mentioned, VIAC upside options are extremely expensive.

Additionally, buy-the-dippers have been loading up on upside calls, hoping for a bounce back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PLTR**\n\n[PLTR June and Jan skews](https://preview.redd.it/wmxs2sx8u6s61.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4465b47b78bd08747a2e8546d0babc57e7c6175)\n\nNothing tooo crazy in PLTR, call skews have been juiced for a while, came back down in the backs ([sold it a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/m75u11/capitalize\\_on\\_high\\_pltr\\_call\\_skew\\_collect\\_decay), will have a trade update on this one!). and has rallied a bit recently in the fronts in anticipation of the Double Click event next week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ARKK Skews**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ARKK June and Jan Skews](https://preview.redd.it/h60xco9su6s61.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=5faadc7b7bf167168baa748f8b71f35b89b54e4c)\n\nARKK isn't one I've followed for a while. But it was interesting to see that ARKK has the cheapest upside calls. For correlation reasons, ARKK should have cheaper calls / more expensive puts than the average of its holdings. Either way, ARKK upside calls *seem* cheap, but its tough to quantify this without some more info on implied correlations. Maybe this is something I can keep track of in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TSLA**\n\nNow, the juicy one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TSLA June and Jan Skews](https://preview.redd.it/fnhhfff4v6s61.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ea65d0c171000be1756352dc32ef4b3e0cfc06a)\n\nTSLA June 800-1000 strike are continues to be extremely depressed, as institutional sellers have been pounding this area.

Might find a way to put on more of this spread, if possible. In TSLA, long dated vols and downside puts in May and June seem to be the best things to sell.
