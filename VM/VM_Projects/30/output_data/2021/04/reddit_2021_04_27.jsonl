Obviously, past performance isn\u2019t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you\u2019re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn\u2019t working for you, refer to the link below!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[Spreadsheet HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPlease note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Enphase fucking MOVES! On average, the magnitude of any given move for it is 15%**!!! An awesome play here would be a long straddle, or reverse iron butterfly. You don\u2019t know which way it\u2019s gonna move, but you do know that wherever it does, it\u2019s gonna fly.\n\n- Although a relatively young company resulting in less data points, **Pinterest also moves with similar magnitude**. You could consider doing something similar on this ticker as well if you think these premiums are better.\n\n- At the opposite end of the spectrum, we\u2019ve got stocks that *dont* move whatsoever during earnings season. The IV on these tickers is unreasonably jacked up for no good reason, so we can look to *sell* options on them to amass a small fortune. **Sirius XM, General Dynamics, CME Group, etc, all don\u2019t really move, but the options are priced as if they are going to anyways**. Use this to your advantage.\n\n- **Over the past 25 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time**! If you want a \u201csafe\u201d gamble, selling ATM put credit spreads would net you some *insane* premiums. BP also follows a similar pattern, clocking in at a 68% beat-rate, allowing us to make this play one two separate days, ensuring we\u2019re not over-leveraged.\n\n- Lastly, **Microsoft also follows an extremely similar pattern, clocking it at a near 70% winrate**. It\u2019s IV is considerably lower than the other two however, so one may want to use standard call / debit spreads in this case as they are pretty cheap relative to the stocks price and implied move.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nObviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin\u2019 companies, theres plenty that I\u2019ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I\u2019d love to see what you guys come up with.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe\u2019ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there\u2019s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll hit up /u/laseryellow and continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, and checking out my socials, it would mean a lot to me! **Happy Trading Everybody! :)**", "id": "mzt4gf", "created_utc": 1619542935.0, "score": 101, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "I truly appreciate this, thanks man!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04114338010549545}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03831057250499725}, {"body": "Excellent my dude!\n\nI guess I'll hold my AMD call", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "And the faithful were rewarded!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I sold mine.

If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I\u2019ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Enphase fucking MOVES! On average, the magnitude of any given move for it is 15%**!!! An awesome play here would be a long straddle, or reverse iron butterfly. You don\u2019t know which way it\u2019s gonna move, but you do know that wherever it does, it\u2019s gonna fly.\n\n- Although a relatively young company resulting in less data points, **Pinterest also moves with similar magnitude**. You could consider doing something similar on this ticker as well if you think these premiums are better.\n\n- At the opposite end of the spectrum, we\u2019ve got stocks that *dont* move whatsoever during earnings season. The IV on these tickers is unreasonably jacked up for no good reason, so we can look to *sell* options on them to amass a small fortune. **Sirius XM, General Dynamics, CME Group, etc, all don\u2019t really move, but the options are priced as if they are going to anyways**. Use this to your advantage.\n\n- **Over the past 25 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time**! If you want a \u201csafe\u201d gamble, selling ATM put credit spreads would net you some *insane* premiums. BP also follows a similar pattern, clocking in at a 68% beat-rate, allowing us to make this play one two separate days, ensuring we\u2019re not over-leveraged.\n\n- Lastly, **Microsoft also follows an extremely similar pattern, clocking it at a near 70% winrate**. It\u2019s IV is considerably lower than the other two however, so one may want to use standard call / debit spreads in this case as they are pretty cheap relative to the stocks price and implied move.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nObviously, since I gave data on over 60 fuckin\u2019 companies, theres plenty that I\u2019ve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I\u2019d love to see what you guys come up with.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n# Conclusion\n\nWe\u2019ve got an insane lineup of companies reporting earnings this week, meaning there\u2019s a huge variety of plays to be made for traders of all skills and styles! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qQTzoK79TEXtzRRmS3zILL-OkosPQ_CJqGrmMlsxp4o/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people found these useful, I'll hit up /u/laseryellow and continue making them throughout the earnings season!
