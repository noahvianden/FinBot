As seen in the link, 60-odd energy stocks are being added to the fund, at the expense of the existing larger stakes (looking at you, PLUG). \n\n.\n\nWhile NEE is the little darling of the change, SunPower Corporation is on the short list of recommended adds. This is interesting, because SPWR is also on the *other* short list... [the list of highly shorted companies](https://www.highshortinterest.com/). SPWR at the time of this writing is over 22% short floated (GME is 24%), and I show -11% short float from the previous month. I'm surprised it's still this high, because the impending rebalance would buy a lot of shares, raising the price. Price goes up, shorts have to exit, things get squeezy. \n\n.\n\nThis is where I like to hope that some intern at one of these hedge funds is reading this post and going to get his boss. If WSB is aware of the potential squeeze, as well as the potential BlackRock buy, there are $600 million in shorts that need to make their way to the door ASAP. I'm not going to say this is Gamestop... we're not at $5... but the current suppressed price is $29.9, and the 3 week high is $35. Just removing the short pressure could get that back, even without the BlackRock buying. I like to hope just the potential of BlackRock's buy will take it that high, but WSB taking note might have a strong incentive effect on hedge fund rectal clenching and take it higher.\n\n.\n\nFundamentally, SPWR is a semiconductor company, P/E ratio is 8.4 (well below semiconductor industry average 25.2), and profits are in a bit of a slump, which should pick up with the green push by the US Government. My interest is in the good price, the heavy short load, and the potential to squeeze. If Blackrock announces the stock in its ETFs, I expect a very nice rise.\n\n.\n\ntl;dr: SPWR is highly shorted and may join Blackrock ETFs. Hedge funds fear the ape.

{"title": "$KHC bull thesis", "selftext": "So I'm sure everyone has seen the news on national ketchup shortage.  In the past when news like this broke like the toilet paper situation. The toilet paper stocks rocketed.   Sanitizer shortages, same thing.  \n\nKHC was green today, but really not that great and low on volume.  Any ideas on why the small price action?\nJust sensory overload, and it was overlooked?   \n\n\nThis stock is top 5 in Buffet's and Burry's portfolio. The company has made all the right moves in terms of paying down debt and making the momentum go the right direction as of late.\n\nI'm thinking that being that we are sitting at a 52 week high there is a mental resistance line to cross. However if you remove that it really looks like this stock price is just ready to take off.\n\nSome interesting catalyst I noticed there has been over $65 million in block purchases made.  I'm not an expert on these but I couldn't see any other block purchases anywhere near this size on khc in recent past.  (If I'm wrong on this, please show me where to find it.)\n\n Assuming that Burry has exercised his call options or will rather than selling, Buffets giant position, the block purchases today, the consistent upwards momentum, the increase in demand and profitability on the ketchup packets.      Things look really really good on this company.  \n\n\nWhen first researching this stock I really didn't fully understand all of the fundamentals that have been falling in place over the last year to get us to this point.   I looked at this stock as a great hedge if and when the market crashes as consumers rotate back into home cooked meals and groceries with less eating out to save money.\n\n\nI see this article and it was the final piece of the puzzle for me.   If we have another wave of covid,. KHC goes up. If everything opens up, KHC goes up.   If stock market keeps ripping and roaring, KHC goes up.   Market and economy crash, KHC goes way up.    \n\nExtremely Bullish on this company.\n\nI am certainly no expert but I love this brand right now.  \nIf anyone wants to add to my thoughts or even poke holes in my statements I encourage it.   Id like to know what everyone else thinks about this company.  \n\n\nEdit update:\nOpen options interest for this week are trending 100% bullish sentiment\n\nToday they announced a new marshmallow snack for grab and go has station type purchases.    Marshmallow is one of the highest profit margins of any food products.\n\nArticle \n[Heinz](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.yahoo.com/amphtml/entertainment/ketchup-shortage-affecting-restaurants-across-195912767.html)\n\n\nPosition update request: I have 600 call option contracts ranging between $40-$41 most of them expiring tomorrow and 16th and 23rd.   Less than 100 expire further out.      I have $45 strike prices as far out as October.    Additionally 300 shares\n\nThis is not a short squeeze play as some have asked.\n\nHowever with the insanely high option call interest ITM or close there could be some significant GAMMA movement I would speculate.\n\nI have been following shortable shares and the availability of them.     As the price has approached $41 there is usually a huge drop in available shares to short right after a steep drop.   This would indicate short ladder attacks by market makers to keep it under $41.   \n\nSpeculation and patterns suggest to me that breaking the $41 mark with momentum would generate enough of a mini short squeeze as well as Gamma to push it immediately to $42-$43 which is then breaking the 52 week high.  After that.  We should see it price closer to proper valuation and by the time earnings come out I think we will be genuinely surprised by what all they have been working on and making progress on their bottom line.", "id": "mmyma1", "created_utc": 1617907799.0, "score": 57, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "Buying calls based on a ketchup shortage is the ultimate autist play.

{"title": "Nanox: Medical Imaging Disruptor", "selftext": "**ABOUT NANOX IMAGING (NNOX)**\n\n* Israeli company that has developed a [digital scanning system](https://www.nanox.vision/our-technology) and medical screening software to replace large/costly machines and software used for X-rays, CT scans, PET scans, and other body imaging services\n* NNOX uses a nano-scale, silicon-based field as the X-ray source, as a low-voltage alternative to traditional machines which heat a metal filament to 2000 degrees Celsius\n* The main NNOX commercial unit weighs 70kg and costs $10k to produce, compared to current devices which weigh 2000kg and cost $1-3 million\n* Reduced heating via cold cathode tech extends machine lifespan\n* **Dumbed down for us retards: an X-ray machine that's smaller, cheaper, lasts longer, and uses less power**\n* NNOX has 3 main products. A single source NANOX.arc device, a multi source NANOX.arc device (made up of the single source device, this will be the commercial product), and NANOX.cloud (the software subscription that comes along with the device, the recurring revenue stream)\n* Has current contracts pending with Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Norway, Taiwan, Singapore, Russia, Italy, Belarus, Spain, South Africa, Mexico, and Guatemala. Contract negotiations ongoing others including India, Canada, and the UK\n* Has a strategic collaboration agreement with the USA, Korea, and Vietnam\n* Partnerships with SK Telecom, Foxxconn, and FujiFilm\n* **[FDA recently granted 510(k) clearance for the single source device](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/04/02/2203966/0/en/Nanox-Announces-FDA-Clearance-of-510-k-for-Single-Source-Nanox-ARC-Digital-X-Ray.html)**, marking a significant milestone for the company and a removal of skepticism brought via \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b's\n\n**ABOUT MUDDY WATERS**\n\n* NOT the legendary singer / songwriter / father of modern Chicago blues, we're instead talking about the short selling firm **muddy waters research**\n* Essentially, muddy waters finds high growth companies, publicly bashes the company, then shorts it relentlessly\n* [Muddy in 2019, saying Tesla will go bankrupt.](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/03/01/tesla-will-go-bankrupt-muddy-waters-researchs-cio.html)\n\n\n**THE SITUATION**\n\nMuddy waters published a NNOX short report in September 2020. It read **\"NNOX has no real product to sell other than its stock\"**. Essentially calling it a complete scam. They are fairly active on twitter, tweeting about NNOX, at times ramping up activity as they increase their short positions. Typical short seller tactics, calling every product fraudulent and accusing any insider selling stock as proof of a ponzi scheme.\n\nNNOX April 1st closing price was $41.33. Single source **FDA clearance was announced Friday April 2nd** (markets closed due to Jesus). Monday April 5th NNOX opened at $64.00, after hitting $70+ in pre-market. Shares started dropping from this high right at the opening bell and closed at $48.55.\n\n*Enter SSR*\n\n**SHORT SALE RESTRICTION (SSR) RULE**\n\nFor those who don't know, when a security **drops 10% or more** (at anytime during the day) from the previous day closing price, SSR is triggered and the opening of new short positions in that security is limited. Under SSR, new short positions can only be opened as stock prices goes up, and this remains in effect until the end of the next day. Essentially **SSR makes it much harder/riskier to short sell successfully.** When a big short seller has enough control of a stock, they can **tactically keep the intraday drop to slightly under 10%, to avoid SSR while maximizing profits**.\n\nOn Tuesday, the NNOX low of the day was $43.71, a 9.97% drop from Monday close. That's an extra **0.03% drop away from SSR**. On Wednesday, the low was $40.40, a 9.74% drop from Tuesday close. That's an extra **0.26% drop away from SSR**. Sure we can't rule out this out as a coincidence, so we'll just call it **statistically extremely improbable.**\n\nDespite a disagreement of their thesis from the FDA, muddy appears to be playing their usual games.\n\n**SHORT VOLUME**\n\nIf any one of you autists has access to **updated** short interest %, please share. Meanwhile [short volume is here](https://imgur.com/Z79jHw1). Jump in short:volume ratio has sustained post fda approval announcement.\n\n**TODAY**\n\nThis morning, there was more positive news for NNOX, involving a partner's (FujiFilm) **[patent filing](https://twitter.com/TerraPharma1/status/1380137316434341890) that would use Nanox rights and IP for innovative mammography equipment**. This news may have helped create a small pop in NNOX price this morning, but once again the shorts squashed any bounce and brought NNOX to even lower levels than yesterday. NNOX closed today at $40.08, a **lower price than it was before FDA clearance**, only three market days after the news. \n\n**PRICE ACTION**\n\nFor anyone familiar with price action when a big short seller is involved, the [NNOX 5 day chart](https://imgur.com/PiFaFfD) paints a pretty clear picture. A gradual slide each day, with any potential peak quickly snuffed out and brought back down to a new low.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nBefore Ellen_Degenerate_69 chimes in, you're right, selling on news is nothing new. However, context matters. The majority of the bear thesis hinged on a lack of regulatory clearance. **Recent price action, short volume, and narrow SSR avoidance is all consistent with a big player at the table**. Considering their outspokenness on this company, all signs point towards muddy waters & co.\n\n**TLDR: Nanox (NNOX) has the potential to revolutionize medical imaging, recently reached a milestone with FDA clearance, shares have been dragged down by \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b\u2019s, and is de-risked at current levels.
