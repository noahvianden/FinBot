{"title": "Is Blink Charging (BLNK) the next Gme?", "selftext": "\n\nBlink Charging is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.\n\nThe main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that Blink is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. Blink has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nBelow I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\n\nAlso I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? \n\nHere is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.\n\nhttps://www.highshortinterest.com/ \n\nhttps://iborrowdesk.com/report/CCGID\n\nHowever I do think that there is reason to claim the stock is undervalued regardless of what the squeeze potential may be if that sanario was to play out.
