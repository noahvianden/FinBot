{"title": "The Weekly Market Recap for Gamblers and Degenerates - March 29th to April 1st", "selftext": "What\u2019s poppin' fellas, Flux here with your weekly market recap! I straight up forgot it was a short week so I was scrambling to write all this out cause I normally do it all last minute like a dipshit college student. If you\u2019re too lazy to read this trash, you can find a video recap of the notes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxzAMzz5GSU). Let\u2019s get into it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Over the weekend, **Bill Hwang, manager of Archegos Capital Management** blew up his entire \u201cfamily-owned\u201d hedge fund in an epic blaze of glory. It was rumored that Billy Boy was running with 20 BILLION dollars of equity on 5x leverage and was margin called after things inevitably went tits up. What blows my mind is that this motherfucker had more money than god, but still felt it was necessary to leverage himself up to the eyeballs like a true degenerate. Live fast, die young, I guess. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks, alongside American media conglomerates **Discovery** (DISC) and **ViacomCBS** (VIAC). Upon liquidation, most of the tickers that were formerly held by the fund plunged over 40%. In a surprise that shocked no one, the banks who allowed yung Bill to leverage himself to the sun and back, Nomura (NMR) and **Credit Suisse (CS), warned that their earnings might take a \u201csignificant hit\u201d following the margin call**, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. Regardless, I hope everyone comes out of this fun little debacle unscathed, and that Bill doesn\u2019t Hwang himself.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- On Monday morning, the massive container-ship blocking the Suez Canal was dislodged! During this week-long blockade, roughly **$9 billion in revenue was lost per day**. That\u2019s equal to 0.5 Archegos Capital Management funds getting blown up every 24 hours, ON TOP of the original one that also got blown up. I know I already went over this, but God dammit Billy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- On Wednesday, the **White House revealed its new, massive infrastructure proposal**, consisting of roughly $2 trillion to help rehabilitate and build out the country's infrastructure, address the crisis around climate change and curb economic inequality. The plan is expected to address a variety of additional issues, such as drinking-water management systems, roads and bridges, refitting and building affordable housing that is environmentally sustainable, elderly welfare, and U.S. manufacturing. To pay for the proposal, Biden will propose **raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% for 15 years and implementing other policies to disincentivize offshoring**. I don\u2019t really know why Biden is acting like us poors won\u2019t foot the bill on higher taxes while the rich use loopholes to get out of it. He claims that \u201cNo one making under $400k will see federal tax increase\u201d, which in a sense, is true. We won\u2019t *see* it, but it\u2019ll indirectly increase anyways. I had the unfortunate pleasure of having to listen to this guys speech, which happened to be boring as fuck. I just wish Biden accidentally muttered \u201cPalantir\u201d on live TV, or told us all to buy APHA and TSLA or something.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Throughout the week **DraftKings** (DKNG) announced a boatload of new partnerships, and acquisitions, the first of which being with the WWE. DKNG and WWE entered an agreement to make the sports betting company the official gaming partner of the WWE, following a deal DKNG made with the UFC recently. I don\u2019t really know why anyone would want to gamble on ***scripted events***, but hey, maybe I'm just a dipshit. People could gamble on Family Guy episodes for all I care, as long as my calls print. **DKNG also acquired Vegas Sports Information Network Inc.**, a multi-platform broadcast and content company providing sports betting news, analysis and data. VSiN, which operates out of Las Vegas, develops, produces, and distributes up to 18-plus hours of live linear sports betting content each day in addition to its sport-themed 24/7 stream. Although DKNG actually closed the week down 1.36%, all these deals and partnerships are really awesome, and are definitely a step in the right direction for the company.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- On Wednesday it was announced that **Microsoft (MSFT) won a U.S. Army contract for augmented reality headsets, worth up to $22 billion over 10 years**. The tech giant is committed to furnish 120,000 AR headsets for the Army based on their Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) design requirements. The standard-issue HoloLens, which costs $3,500, enables people to see holograms overlaid over their actual environments and interact with them using hand and voice gestures. I'm a big ass nerd, so all this kind of gets me excited for the potential future of AR video games and shit. Regardless, this contract comes a year and a half after Microsoft won a cloud contract from the Pentagon that could be worth up to $10 billion, firmly embedding MSFT\u2019s place within our government. MSFT closed the week up nearly 5%, a meteoric rise for such a behemoth of a stock.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **BlackBerry** (BB) reported earnings on Tuesday, and let me tell you, it *wasn\u2019t* pretty. BB reported a loss of $315 million, or 56 cents a share, after posting losses of 7 cents a share a year ago. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $210 million, down from $282 million in the same period last year. The earnings call was a fucking disaster. Our homie John Chen came onto the call and basically said *\u201cyeah, we lost a shitload of money, we've sucked for the past decade, but now we suck way more. Also, the SEC got mad at how we're casually bullshitting our numbers, and oh, the one thing that actually generates consistent revenue for us? We decided to stop doing it altogether on the off-chance that we can get someone else to buy it\u201d*. Obviously I paraphrased it, but that\u2019s more or less what he said. Feel free to listen to the two hour call if you don\u2019t believe me. A poor report, combined with abysmal guidance, means that I\u2019m gonna be bagholding this shit forever. What the fuck. BlackBerry closed the week down 11%.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Thursday was an awesome day for EVs, with both **NIO** and **XPEV** releasing their monthly vehicle deliveries. NIO set a new monthly record of 7,257 deliveries, resulting in a total of 20,060 deliveries in their first quarter, marking a gain of over 423% year-over-year. XPEV reported similar results, having delivered 5,102 vehicles in March, resulting in 13,340 Q1 deliveries, marking an even higher 487% gain YOY. On Friday, the homie Elon finally took a break from pumping Dogecoin, and reported  184,800 Q1 vehicle deliveries, making the Chinese EV manufacturers look like chumps. Luckily for us, this bomb was dropped after hours, though I\u2019m sure come Monday we\u2019ll see a nice jump in **TSLA**. XPEV closed the week out up 17%, with NIO trailing closely behind, closing up a little over 11%.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- To end this week off on some good news, the **S&P 500 (SPY) closed at a new all time high of 400**! Throughout the trading day on Thursday, SPY was sexually attracted to, but equally disgusted by 400. With 15 minutes left on the clock, SPY finally took that leap of faith, and closed the week out at $400.86. I remember a year ago, someone said that they thought S&P stood for Stimulus and Printer 500. At the time, I laughed at the man, but today, I finally understood what he was saying. He wasn\u2019t wrong. What a historic moment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAll in all, that wraps up this week's recap! Just remember, that even if you somehow managed to lose money this month, unless you\u2019ve blown up your account five times over, you\u2019re still outperforming Archegos Capital Management. Let\u2019s pour one out for Billy Boy, for he flew too close to the sun. I hope you all get to spend time with loved ones this weekend, and I wish you all a happy Easter.

{"title": "Looking for diversification advice!", "selftext": "Hello there!\n\nAs the title suggests, I'm currently looking for sectors in which to invest other than Tech (I'm already quite tech heavy). \n\nI'm 21, I have read quite a bit about this and with 2 years of experience in this world, prefered to start early because \"Time in the market beats timing the market\", with a moderate risk tolerance. \nI understand the benefit of being diversified, but I personally think that knowing the sector that you are invested in gives 95% of the time better results than \"diversifying for the sake of doing it\", that's why I went tech heavy for a start.\n\nI have no preference between value or growth, but I value some kind of stability AND dividends (aiming for looong term holding). \n150% a month plays are nice, but I prefer avoiding the -60% that comes the following week / month. \n\nMy current holdings are:\n\n26% TSM (Semiconductor manufacturing)\n\n26% AAPL (Tech)\n\n24% NVDA (Tech / Semic / IA)\n\n24% LOGI (Computer peripherials)\n\n\nEDIT: That's only taking the stocks % into account. Cash makes for ~40% of the portfolio right now.\n\nThe portfolio took a beating last month, but It's already well into the green realm. The beating is what showed me that I should consider diversifying to other sectors (after looking at them in depth) for the sake of stability. \n\nCurrently considering: \n\nVolkswagen (Automotive sector, future safe EV play, nice div., Germany's prefered child)\n\nBlackrock (Financial sector, too-big-to-fall, the \"safest\" I found)\n\nPaypal (FinTech with a foot into the crypto world lately)\n\nAnd a couple of spanish small caps (I'm from Spain) that I know locally that will grow during the upcoming years. \n\nAny suggestion of which I should choose, or what sector should I look into?

{"title": "DD: Boomer Edition round 2 - Construction \ud83d\udea7\ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f Stock - \ud83e\udd85 Eagle Materials EXP", "selftext": "Looking for an undervalued company filled with hard workers and actual physical products?  Tired of stocks focused digital things and imaginary future technology that might exist someday?!  Well my second \ud83e\udd48 round of boomer deep dives is for you.  Last time we talked about \ud83d\ude82 this time \ud83e\uddf0\ud83d\udd28\ud83d\udc77\ud83d\udea7\n\nSo out in Dallas Texas there is great Dividend giving company called Eagle Materials \ud83e\udd85\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf2\n\nLet's look at their profile compared to competitors in the construction materials field.\n\nEagles Materials\nRevenue: $1.2 billion\nRevenue growth: 15%\nProfit Margins: 20%\nEmployees: 2200\nPE 16.37\n\nMartin Marietta Materials \nRevenue: $4 billion\nRevenue growth: 3%\nProfit Margins: 12%\nEmployees:  8800\nPE: 28.92\n\nSummit Materials\nRevenue: 2.33 Billion\nRevenue Growth: 5%\nProfit Margins: 6%\nEmployees: 6,000\nPE: 23.28\n\nLooks like they have far lower price to earnings with better growth and better profits.  They also get a bit more out per employee.  \n\nEffecient and growing \ud83e\udeb4.  This is what we want in companies!\n\nNow for one of the key points on why this is a 2x buy check their financial filings: http://ir.eaglematerials.com/investor-relations\n\nIn their annual report they reiterate the intention of the company to separate their heavy and light materials divisions into entirely independent publically traded stocks.    Why are they doing this?  Because the board and CEO know their stocks are undervalued and a major shareholders they are tired of it.  Splitting the company means you get two stocks with an undervalued PE ratio in more concise markets.  Easier to prove value and easier to get investor intention with a big move.  Those two stocks aren't staying down and even if they evaluate close to properly compared to their competition you are already close to a 2x deal!\n\nBut that's not all.  It isn't just that Eagle is in a good position now, the market puts them in a good position long term to succeed.\n\n1. Materials\ud83e\uddf1 are scarce\ud83d\udd0e across the board right now.  Everyone is behind on deliverys due to COVID related disruptions and the economy reving up too fast.  There is no fast solution to the backlog which means guaranteed revenue stream for over a year AND efficient companies benefit the most by having room to gain market share.  On top of that material suppliers are getting the opportunity to line their pockets with a bit of extra revenue since there really isn't competition for customers in this market.  Many companies aren't even taking on new customers right now because they are already stuck managing allocations for their existing base.\n\n2. Commercial Real Estate is going down hard.  \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\ud83d\udd87\ufe0f\ud83d\udcc9Office space in major cities is coming to an end and nothing can stop it.  Companies now know they need less office space and less people in the office so they aren't going to fork out anywhere near as much leasing space in expensive locations like NYC, LA, Chicago, etc.   The restructuring\ud83c\udfd7\ufe0f needed to account for this will require materials and materials you need for these conversions are the exact types of Products Eagle offers\ud83e\uddf1.  Clear case of forward looking demand.\n\nBoomer Points:\n\n1. While it is true that millennials probably couldn't hang dry wall if their lives depended on it \ud83d\ude34Joe is going let \ud83c\uddf2\ud83c\uddfd\ud83c\udf2e back in and they can definitely help with all the labor shortages in the construction industry.  We may soon be back to the days where you can pay they nice gentlemen outside home depot to come help you finish a project no questions asked.  Don't have to worry about shithead contractors not showing up for quote.  \n\n2. \ud83e\udd85 is a legimate company that offers their employees pensions, stock options, and solid wages.  People who work there want to work there.  It isn't like my job at Wendy's.  This is a company where talent stays.\n\n3. Dividends \ud83e\udd29!!!! You can grow your shares more by having shares!\n\nCons: \n\n1. Commercial Real Estate crash might bring down everything in the real estate and construction market for a while.  Depends on how much bag holding the commercial landlords insist on doing.  If they don't recalibrate quickly or decide to beg for bailouts we might see a mini recession in that market with lots of empty spaces and no activity to refresh or maintain.  \n\n2.
