I mean for example Amazon had a PE of over 1000 a few years ago - and obviously back then it would\u2019ve been a fantastic buy.\n\nWhat I mean is why high PE ratios can suggest the stock is higher risk, big tech generally attracts higher PE multiples due to the fact there is still huge potential even for mature tech companies (for example Google have entire divisions dedicated to technology 5-10yrs away, self driving cars, aiming to develop self aware AI etc)\n\nWhereas a bank like Goldman has a much lower PE ratio because whilst it is a huge reliable cash cow, ultimately a mature bank just can\u2019t grow like a big tech company can. \n\nI\u2019m not saying I necessarily disagree with your strategy (in fact I only have 25% of my portfolio in tech, the rest is in recovery/\u201cold economy\u201d stocks) - but P/E ratios should be just one factor in your analysis", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "May I ask what stocks those are?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "The recovery stocks?

They have big defence contracts, burgeoning green tech, nuclear power station contracts - their bread and butter is jet engines which has obviously been hit hard, but they\u2019ve raised $10bn in funding now so have ample liquidity even if airline travel doesn\u2019t recover.\n\nAnd if there is a big recovery - currently it has a $12bn market cap, pretty much half of it what it was pre covid. If jet engine orders go back to pre Covid levels, they\u2019ll be making $2bn profit a year. Plus you get exposure to their other research eg green tech\n\nBP - similarly massively down from pre Covid levels. Nowadays it\u2019s trendy to sh*t all over big oil, but ultimately whatever happens with green tech, oil will be huge for the next 20-30 yrs minimum (not just cars it\u2019s used in plastics and tons of other materials everyone uses daily). When things go back to normal it should recover 50%+ hopefully\n\nBoeing - similar story to Rolls Royce, still massively below pre pandemic levels. Unless you think air travel will stay low permanently, should be huge scope for recovery\n\nREITs are also worth looking into imho, I own a few - they\u2019ve been beaten up badly during Covid and obviously retail/office has been hit badly, but again I would expect the worst to be behind them - yet many of them are still substantially below pre Covid levels\n\nSo yeah that\u2019s my \u201cold economy\u201d basket of stocks - despite not being as exciting as tech, I\u2019m actually doing very well so far (up around 30% since start of the year) - of course it very much depends on the speed of the recovery", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recovery", "jpm", "ba"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27503085136413574}], "tickers": ["amzn", "recovery"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": -3, "replies": [{"body": "What are you buying", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17983245849609375}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.05678156763315201}, {"body": "Apple is a great company in a dominant position, but the fact is they are overvalued. \n\nI always lean towards value stocks/funds. valuation matters and in the long run you get more bang for the buck with stocks that are fairly valued or under-valued.
