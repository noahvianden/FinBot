Their main utility is that it theoretically allows us to continue to use a central line that has developed bacterial colonization. The problem with this is in hospital settings, when a patient develops a suspected CLABSI, we typically make the diagnosis by removing the catheter and test it for evidence of bacterial colonization. Also, we typically remove it regardless, as a potential source.

So really, concerning complication rate is somewhere around 1% which is much more in line with my experience. True CVC placement complications are rare. I've performed hundreds, and have seen thousands performed. \n\nIf Mino-Lok was able to prevent CLABSIs, I'd be all ears, but having to replace a CVC is not a big deal, and likely most physicians would opt with removing the source of infection rather than potentially leaving the source in and risking significant liability if the patient has a bad outcome.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ah, that all makes a lot of sense.

{"title": "CVM premiums... am I missing something here? Has anybody else been printing money off these absolutely insane premiums?", "selftext": "My account size is relatively small so high volatility options are the only things worth my time to sell. I look at option data, strike premium and prob OTM mostly, and if the numbers say its a good deal I look at the chart to see just how much of a crap show this high volatility stock I just learned about 5 min ago is. This is usually where I see why the premiums are so fat, and I go from seeing dollar signs to seeing a steam roller just waiting for me to pick up some pennies.\n\nSometimes however, I will find what I consider to be the perfect put to sell.  The strike is far from being in the money and low enough for my account size to handle, the bid price is on a totally different level to any other options with similar strikes, and the prob OTM is well within my comfort zone. Even the charts look good, the strike lies well below the lowest price the stock has hit in over a year. Basically, people are paying top dollar to bet on this stock to just absolutely nose dive, anything less than the most extreme bearish movements and I win. Don't you just love it when the odds are heavily in your favor?\n\nFor me, CVM is the stock that fits this description perfectly. Since I discovered this ticker through a high volatility stock scan in November, it has been my premium printing machine. At the time I first found it, stock price was trending around $11-13 and I sold my first CVM put at a 10 strike for .60 with about 30 days left. Its close, but the stock hadn't dropped below $10 since January. Almost every other high volatility stock I was looking at had attractive strike bids because they showed no hesitation dipping below the strike, and the premiums were cheaper despite this. Contrarily, CVM puts are more expensive for a strike that the stock hasn't touched in a very long time, and still hasn't even come close to touching yet.\n\nFast forward to today, and CVM has only become more volatile, however it still hasn't come close to touching 10. Its currently up to about $21 which is shocking, but even more shocking is the fact puts at a 10 strike are STILL going for the same juicy premiums. Yesterday I sold another 10 strike put with 30 days left for .65, its literally more expensive than it was when the stock was just a couple dollars away from the strike. Thats what I call a good deal. I also sold 2 7.5 strike puts expiring the 16th for .40 each, again the stock is at $21. Thats like a 80% drop or something happening in a month just to bring me down to break even, absolute insanity. Even the 5 strike has buyers for .20, but I like to play it dangerous with 7.5 and 10 strikes mostly. Maybe 12.5 if I'm really feeling wild.\n\nSince November I have sold monthly CVM puts at the 7.5 and 10 strikes for around the same premiums I mentioned above, usually 3 or 4 at a time and have made about $1000 total from CVM premiums alone. Thats basically 10% of my current account balance which seems like a hell of a return to make in 8 months to me, especially for the relative low risk I feel I have to take on. Easily the most money I've made off of a single stock is CVM, and I have never owned a single share. God I love selling puts.\n\nThe insane distance between strike and market price makes these contracts just absolutely bleed premium, every day the stock doesn't make a 50% drop the option loses significant value. Red days are never red enough, and green days are just icing on the premium cake. If the whole stock market is down, my CVM puts are up, even when CVM is down. Its a nice light hedge to my account, everything else may be red but you better believe my short CVM put are lit up green like a Christmas tree. The great CVM crash delayed yet another day, CVM option buyers everywhere lose millions.\n\nTo end this, what exactly am I missing here with CVM? Is total bankruptcy actually a massive possibility? Who are these morons paying $40 cash for a strike thats nowhere near market price and hasn't been touched in a long time? Am I moron for selling near 300% volatility options? I feel like I never see this stock mentioned much at all, maybe because recommending high volatility stocks can be irresponsible advice, but the premiums some of these strikes are going for are unreal. .65 for a 10 strike when the stock is at $21... thats like beyond selling FD's to WSB, I'm selling dreams to idiots, or somebody with a massive CVM position just wants their entire portfolio insured by puts. Either one is fine by me, just keep that premium coming baby.\n\nOh yea, I also couldn't tell you exactly what CVM even does as a business. Some kind of biopharm research I think, I'm not gunna waste time pretending to understand. It doesn't really matter especially for short term trades like these, volatile stocks are going to do whatever they want in the short term and no amount of technical or fundamental analysis is going to be reliable. Instead of hopeful speculation buying a stock, playing the odds with short options allows you to customize your risk/reward and gives you real numbers/probabilities to base trade decisions off instead of theoretical analysis and your gut feeling.", "id": "o2d8xy", "created_utc": 1623979617.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 42, "comments": [{"body": "The deal is they are basically waiting on data the will make or break their company.

Cost, revenue, and resource sharing - this has proved incredibly important as it has allowed myovant to have 2 sales teams and a foot in the door, providing the aforementioned rapid sales growth.\n2. Cash payments on a tiered system with double digit royalties if pfizer exercises their rights to serve any of the ex-us markets granted by the deal.\n\nSumitomo (Sumitovant) -\n\nCurrently holding 53.5% of the company, they make the largest investor by far. They were able to acquire an initial stake from Roivant and have increased their stake since with another planned purchase of over a million shares coming before the end of the year. They are also very likely to buyout the company, but this is explained in more detail down below.\n\nOther Institutions -\n\nTheres a nice large chunk of other institutions like Takeda (held by ark) and a few others who own a position here. In fact, so many other institutions are holding, that the shares available to retail are about 5% of the company! To put that into perspective, amc is an 80% retail float. Follow the big money here.\n\n**The current valuation:** \n\nRight now, the current market cap from a very basic perspective is sitting at $1.8b. The company currently has $725m of this in cash with more to come upon completion of future milestones from Pfizer (management has called these \"Achievable\" in past calls) as well as sales from their drug. This means the company is sitting on close to 40% of its market cap in cash.\n\nTo expand, each of the use cases approved is expected to see more than 1b a year in net revenue within the next few years.\u00a0So what do analysts on WS think? Consensus is in mid 30s (50% more than current)\u00a0[with Evercore ISI projecting a $55 PT and another firm at $42!](https://www.markets.co/analysts-have-conflicting-sentiments-on-these-healthcare-companies-constellation-pharmaceuticals-nasdaq-cnst-myovant-sciences-nyse-myov-and-surgalign-holdings-nasdaq-srga/321463/)\n\nValue is the name of the game here\u00a0Looking at the share price and chart, you might say, oh man, why has this dropped? Good question, and good news. There has been no significant news in the past 2 weeks causing a price change. It is my theory that intraday shorting has dropped the price of the stock to a point for a big investor (possibly goldman sachs who seemed very bullish on their last call but doesn't have a position) could make an entrance.\n\n**The future prospects:**\n\nBy the end of June they are expected to submit an NDA for relugolix for the treatment of Endometriosis. This is likely to be approved as their data has been incredibly strong (triple threat) and they already have relugolix approved on the market. Further, the company has 2 peer reviewed publications on relugolix in the New England Journal of medicine for its possibility as a standard of care treatment.\n\nIf you go and look at the end of the [RFP](https://res.cloudinary.com/pcf/image/upload/v1623079191/FINAL_PCF-PFE-MYOV_Relugolix_Challenge_Awards_RFP_vlte5l.pdf) recently published, they are currently exploring Relugolix as a treatment for hormone induced breast cancer. Within this, they are also exploring other opportunities for relugolix with the help of Pfizer.\n\nMVT - they are exploring this compound and seeing positive data for the treatment of infertilityMyovant has also confirmed that they are shopping for other compounds to purchase and add to their already strong pipeline.\n\n**List of catalysts:**\u00a0I am keeping a list of future possible catalysts for the company. It should be noted that these catalysts are only the short term ones to keep the list short.\n\n1. Endometriosis submission to FDA\u00a0 \u00a0\n2. Announcement of further relugolix lifecycle development\n3. Proxy filing - (likely to come in June or july similar to last year) we should learn details about Lynn\u2019s departure and more importantly, payout\u00a0\n4. Part D and Medicare coverage for prostate cancer application - expected in first half of year (any day now)\u00a0\n5. EMA decision to approve for uterine fibroids for sale in EU (positive CHMP recommendation makes this highly likely and comes with multimillion dollar direct cash payment)\u00a0\n6. Pfizer optionality - Pfizer can opt in to sell in EU. Resulting in a 50m cash payment\u00a0\n7. Possible acquisition of new drug pipelines\u00a0\n8. Data read outs for the current trials\u00a0\n9. Q2 earnings - (expected in august)\u00a0\n10. Possible acquisition of myovant\n\n**Buyout possibility:**\u00a0Sumitovant (mentioned above) has a very strong interest in aquiring myovant. This can be assumed for 3 reasons.\n\n1. They have purchased 4 out of 5 of the \"Vants\"\u00a0[from their deal with roivant](https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/news/deals/sumitomo-takes-out-urovant-and-myovant-beckons).\n2. They have a patent cliff on their current pipeline that expires in 2023 and by IFRS standards they can only claim the amount of revenue to their books in comparison to the stake they own\n3. They have shown in multiple investor presentations that they have plans to acquire Myovant.\n\n**Last but not least, fuck the shorts:**\n\nIt should be noted that the companies who are short myovant are the very same ones short $GME $AMC and other notable names. The list includes; citadel, Jane Street, Point 72, Susquehanna, and more!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/margpiml8x571.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=55e4b06fbe4868b44d566a791536a2dad6d9d96c\n\nOne more note: Fuck Cancer.", "id": "o2ciol", "created_utc": 1623977262.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|11|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|74|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2ciol/myov_a_derisked_fire_sale_with_2_fda_approved/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2cgqk/myov_a_derisked_fire_sale_with_2_fda_approved/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mlok9n/myov_deep_value_and_possible_buy_out/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mq5wlw/xbi_107_short_interest_from_hfs_including_citadel/) \n**Account Age**|2 years ago|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46531474590301514}, {"body": "I bought a few\u2026simply because I have endometriosis AND my dad has prostrate cancer.

As more people started eating ass, chocolate demand has also gone up. This is science, fellas.

{"title": "Rite Aid ( RAD ) Earnings Due Out Next Week - June 24, 2021. Strong results due to COVID-19 vaccinations administered could be a catalyst for the stock price to climb higher.", "selftext": "As we head into next week (week of Jun 21, 2021) with Rite Aid ( $RAD ) set to report fiscal Q1 earnings of Thursday, June 24th, some points to consider:\r  \n\r  \n1) The market cap of the stock is now right around one billion dollars. Does that sound reasonable for a company with $24 billion in annual revenue, positive cash flow, and $8 per share in adjusted EBITDA last year (during a COVID-19 stressed year, no less)?\r  \n\r  \n2) The company provided guidance for the new / current Q1 of their 2022 fiscal year and indicated a break-even result +/- $10 million. This represents a net earnings improvement of $63 to $83 million versus the prior year.\r  \n\r  \n3) RAD management indicated they had administered 2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first six weeks of the new / current fiscal year. Through the first half of the year, it appears 6 million doses will likely be delivered by Rite Aid. This will result in $210 million in incremental revenue and $2 per share to net earnings. Also, Pfizer's CEO mentioned today (April 15, 2021) that a third booster coronavirus shot will likely be required and that we should expect the COVID-19 vaccine to be administered annually like the flu shot.\r  \n\r  \n4) The short attacks on the stock have ramped up against RAD recently.  Short interest is up to 15.5% of the total outstanding shares.  That represents 8.33 million shares short.  Institutions, mutial funds, and insiders own more than 60% of the total shares outstanding.  That means that 35.8% to 46.3% shares are short excluding ownership by institutions, mutual funds, and insiders.  **Positive earnings on June 24th could be a catalyst for a major squeeze.** \r  \n5) The Bartell Drugs acquisition closed at the start of 2021.  While it is unlikely to contribute materially to net earnings during the current fiscal year, it is expected to do so next year. The acquisition makes Rite Aid the pharmacy leader in the Seattle market.\r  \n\r  \n6) Year-to-Date high share price is $32.48 and there are only 55 millioin shares total outstanding.\r  \n\r  \n7) The company has $3.1 billion in debt, which is being adequately managed (---meaning Rite Aid was able to service the debt, buy Bartell drugs, and still maintain positive cash flow last year). For the new / current fiscal year, it appears likely that Rite Aid is positioned to book positive net earnings and cash flow (improving cash flow even further).\r  \n\r  \n8) Break-up value of the company is estimated to be in the range of $40 - $50 per share.  This despite a current share price of under $21.  \n\n\rDoes this sound like a company that should be trading at less than $21 per share with a market cap of just $1 billion?", "id": "o2ww7t", "created_utc": 1624041202.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 41, "comments": [{"body": "lmao, WSB has come full circle,", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Very true, very true.

This is conceivably an acquisition target too, no?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, I believe there are at least three (3) parties who would recognize significant strategic gains from an acquisition of Rite Aid:\n\n\\*\\*\\* Amazon ( $AMZN ) \\*\\*\\*\r  \n\r  \nCFRA Research group recently stated (Thursday, June 3, 2021) in its latest Rite Aid (RAD) analysis report:\r  \n\r  \n\"It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.\"\r  \n\r  \nAlso, it should be noted that there is already a partnership existing between Amazon and Rite Aid since July of 2019. Rite Aid was the first partner that Amazon selected for its retail in-store pick-up program called Amazon Counter. Here is the link for the launch of the program:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-rite-aid/amazon-launches-new-in-store-pickup-option-with-rite-aid-as-first-partner-idUSKCN1TS0RI\r  \n\r  \nSo the companies are already coordinating some business activities to a minor extent.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, with the acquisition of Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid became the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle, WA. Should Amazon buyout Rite Aid, AMZN itself would be able to cut out the middleman and provide cost effective prescription drug benefits to its 75,000 employees at the Seattle headquarters.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*\\* Walmart ( $WMT ) \\*\\*\\*\r  \n\r  \nWalmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.\r  \n\r  \nA couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:\r  \n\r  \nWalmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability\r  \n\r  \nAll the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.\r  \n\r  \nBased on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.\r  \n\r  \nThe Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.\r  \n\r  \nIf you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.\r  \n\r  \nWhichever company, Walmart or Amazon, utlimately decides to buy Rite Aid, that corporation will instantly become the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA, and will be well-positioned to someday challenge CVS and Walgreens for the #1 or #2 spots.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*\\* Walgreens ( $WBA ) \\*\\*\\*\r  \n\r  \nAnother darkhorse in this whole race is Walgreens. This week, Walgreens completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen for $6.5 billion (---see link below this paragraph). This windfall gives WBA the needed funds to finally finish the takeover of Rite Aid that it started back in 2015. While that deal was ultimately blocked by the courts, no judge could reasonably claim today that there is insufficent competition to support consumers if the balance of Rite Aid was taken over by Walgreens (NOTE: WBA bought 1,900+ RAD stores in 2018, and RAD currently has 2,500+ stores remaining). With CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger, and numberous mail order prescription services (including Amazon), there is pleny of competition in the USA.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/walgreens-completes-divestiture-of-alliance-healthcare-to-amerisourcebergen-for-%246.5b-2021\r  \n\r  \nAn acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens would be a highly strategic move accomplishing the following:\r  \n\r  \n\\- Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting WBA in a much more competitive position with CVS\r  \n\r  \n\\- Giving Walgreens a PBM in Rite Aid's Elixir group that would help WBA gain more prescription drug business share compete more successfully in that category\r  \n\r  \n\\- Blocking both Amazon ( $AMZN ) and Walmart ( $WMT ) from acquiring Rite Aid thereby removing the threat of a financially powerful competitor moving into the #3 retail pharmacy spot in the USA.\r  \n\r  \nSo, it may very well be the case, that the race is on to see who will acquire Rite Aid!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Brilliant write up here.

{"title": "Transocean $RIG: Energy Stock - 17% Short Interest - 6/18/21 Update", "selftext": "Position Update:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1flv5ugdi2671.png?width=259&format=png&auto=webp&s=25b2ebbcacba61c7e5eb8465887f1c16f61c90f6\n\nWhat Happened This Week:\n\nA bunch of positive developments happened for RIG this week. I'll list them briefly below in plain English.\n\n1. RIG signed two new contracts for $116mm of new backlog, a huge blow to the shorts who said it couldn't be done\n2. RIG announced a $460mm vendor financing deal with its shipyards, delaying the capex on the newbuilds until 2022, which substantially improves the company's liquidity, another huge blow to the shorts\n3. Board Member and Company Insider Frederick Mohn bought $5mm shares between $4.17 - $4.20\n4. Oil prices continue to move higher, even after Fed officials appear to be focusing on controlling rising inflation\n\nAnother development occurred which I view as neutral.\n\n1. RIG disclosed an \"At-The-Money\" mixed shelf offering of $400mm, which could include issuing more stock. However, the filing gives RIG maximum flexibility to help the company beat back the shorts. It's \"credit positive\" in that it allows RIG to avoid drawing on their corporate credit card and makes them a safer lender. It also gives RIG until 2023 or longer for the offshore drilling cycle to kick into gear, which is a lifetime in this business. With the shipyard financing deal they signed, RIG has no immediate need for cash, so there's zero chance they issue this equity today when their stock trades in the $3s. Further, an insider like Mohn isn't stupid. He knows this business is totally undervalued. I think his open market purchases of RIG stock on Jun 15 / 16 indicates that i) offshore drilling has bottomed and ii) the company is going to be supportive of shareholders. Buying today means you're buying into a super undervalued company with a 17% short interest at a cheaper price than a 12% shareholder with a ton of upside if things play out like I think they will.\n\n**Bottom Line: I think $RIG trades to $7 - $10 by October, if not sooner. The investment thesis has never been stronger. All signs continue to point to a massive win for $RIG.**", "id": "o2ym3o", "created_utc": 1624045691.0, "score": 61, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 49, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|24|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2ym3o/transocean_rig_energy_stock_17_short_interest/) \n**Account Age**|10 months ago|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34235477447509766}, {"body": "This is a sleeper stock.

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 21st, 2021", "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 21st, 2021.\n\n# **The Fed will continue to dominate the market in the week ahead after sell-off - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/the-fed-will-continue-to-dominate-the-market-in-the-week-ahead-after-sell-off.html)**\n*****\n> The Federal Reserve\u2019s signal that it is looking to step away from some of its easy policy is expected to be a dominant trading theme in the week ahead and likely for the rest of the summer.\n*****\n> In the past week, investors repositioned across the financial markets after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the central bank was considering tapering its purchases of Treasurys and mortgage securities. That is important since when the Fed eventually acts, it would be the first serious reversal of the easy policies it put in place to add liquidity to markets when the economy shut down last year because of the Covid crisis.\n*****\n> The purchases, which amount to $120 billion a month, would be gradually whittled away once the Fed decides to slow down and end the bond buying, or quantitative easing. That could then open the door to interest rate hikes, which the Fed now projects would come in 2023.\n*****\n> The Federal Reserve sent ripples across financial markets after its meeting Wednesday. The dollar jumped, stocks fell and bond yields moved to imply higher short-term interest rates in the future. The Dow fell 3.5%, its worst week since October. The S&P 500 was down 1.9% for the week, its worst weekly loss since February, and the Nasdaq lost just 0.3%, helped by a small weekly gain in tech.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the market is still digesting the Fed meeting,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. Stocks were trading sharply lower Friday, after weakness Wednesday and Thursday. Yields fell on longer duration bonds, like the benchmark 10-year, but rose on the shorter duration 2- and 5-year notes.\n*****\n> The spreads between those shorter-duration notes and the 10- and 30-year bond yields narrowed dramatically in a so-called flattening trade. That\u2019s common when interest rates are rising. The higher short rates reflect the expected increases in the fed funds rate, while the longer duration yields fall, because the thinking historically has been that a tightening Fed slows the economy.\n*****\n> The Fed also provided new economic forecasts, including a chart on interest rates that shows it expects to hike its fed funds rate twice in 2023, after its prior forecast included no increases.\n*****\n> Fed speakers will get a lot of attention in the week ahead. Powell speaks Tuesday before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis on the Fed\u2019s policy response and the economy. His remarks could be a highlight of what looks to be a slow, but volatile first week of summer for markets.\n*****\n> There are a number of other Fed officials speaking, including New York Fed President John Williams on Monday and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, both Tuesday. Other Fed speakers include Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.\n*****\n> \u201cGetting more color from others will certainly be key,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Global Advisors. \u201cI\u2019m most interested certainly in what Powell has to say. They\u2019re all going to give us now the fine print of what was in the statement and what Powell said\u201d at the end of the Fed\u2019s June meeting.\n*****\n> There should be a lot of interest in personal consumption expenditures data next Friday, since it includes the PCE inflation index, closely watched by the Fed. The Fed has been pressing its view that elevated inflation readings are just temporary and that they should calm down next year.\n*****\n> Boockvar said the inflation data should reflect the same spike in prices that showed up in the consumer price index for May, up 5% year over year.\n*****\n> \u201cIt\u2019s going to show some pretty robust month-over-month increases,\u201d said Boockvar. He said inflation data will be the most important for markets.\n*****\n> \u201cThat\u2019s what the rest of the year is all about \u2014 inflation, inflation, inflation and how does the Federal Reserve adjust to that,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this inflation debate, it\u2019s not just a U.S. thing, it\u2019s a global thing.\u201d\n*****\n> While the Fed has now penciled in two interest rate hikes for 2023, the market is more skeptical about inflation. According to futures markets, investors believe there could be one or more rate hikes next year and at least four in total before the end of 2023.\n*****\n> The Fed forecast 3.4% PCE inflation for this year, up a full point from its March forecast, but it still expects a tame 2.1% pace next year.\n*****\n> Housing data will also be of big interest to markets, after the Fed\u2019s tiny step forward toward tightening unleased a surge in mortgage rates.\n*****\n> The rate for the 30-year fixed loan jumped to 3.25% by Thursday, the highest in months, according to Mortgage News Daily. The Fed is currently purchasing about $40 billion a month in mortgage securities, and that would slow down along with Treasury buying.\n*****\n> Existing home sales are released Tuesday, and new home sales are reported Wednesday.\n*****\n> # Value versus growth\n> Keon said the market is choppy but taking in stride the change in the Fed. He said he has overweight stocks in his portfolios. \u201cWe like that position with earnings likely to grow 40% this year, rates staying pretty low. That\u2019s a good environment for stocks,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> As the market traded lower this past week, tech and some growth names held their ground. Tech was barely positive, registering a nearly 0.1% gain for the week. The worst performing sectors were in the value space \u2014 commodities-related or part of the reopening cyclical trade.\n*****\n> Materials were down 6.3% for the week, and financials were down more than 6% as a flattening yield curve has the potential to hurt bank profits.\n*****\n> \u201cWe had a very good move for value stocks and for the reopening plays. They really did well for six months or so,\u201d said Keon. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the market that keeps going forever. This is probably a bit of a counter rotation. Whether it\u2019s the beginning of a major shift or a slight bounce back [for tech], is hard to say and rates are going to be a determinant.\u201d\n*****\n> Keon said if the closely watched 10-year yield goes to 2% from its current 1.5%, that would be a positive for value stocks. But if it stays anchored around 1.5%, tech could continue to do well.\n*****\n> The 10-year yield, which is the benchmark Treasury, fluctuated widely in the past week. After starting the week at about 1.45%, it moved higher right after the Fed meeting to as high as 1.59% but then fell back down to about 1.44% Friday afternoon.\n*****\n> The 2-year note yielded 0.256% on Friday, up sharply from the prior week\u2019s Friday close of 0.149%.\n*****\n> \u201cMy guess is that the thinking is that at the press conference, Powell made it pretty clear he has no intention of raising rates until 2023,\u201d said Keon. \u201cUntil you get to 2023, you\u2019re going to get the boom we are in now, and you\u2019re going to get pretty strong growth in 2022. By the time, you get to 2023, the economy is going to be slowing and is the Fed going to raise rates in a slowing economy? Probably not.\u201d\n*****\n> Keon said that would keep a cap on the size of the Fed rate hikes. He said there\u2019s little chance the Fed will hike before 2023 unless there\u2019s an upside surprise in inflation.\n*****\n> \u201cThe market thinks the Fed is not going to raise rates until 2023, absent an unexpected surprise to inflation, and that they\u2019re not going to raise rates that much in 2023 because they\u2019ll be risking a recession,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the Fed has now injected a new level of volatility into the markets. He expects investors will be on edge now as the Fed\u2019s late July meeting approaches and again as the Fed heads to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in late August for its annual symposium.\n*****\n> Many economists expect Jackson Hole to be the forum where the Fed releases details of the tapering program. Once the Fed announces it will cut back, it is then expected to wait a few months before slowly paring back the purchases over many months. The end of the easing program is important since it would then open the door to a potential rate hike, based on the strength of the economy.\n*****\n> \u201cThe narrative here is the markets are likely to continue going back and forth with regard to their view on the Fed assessment of whether transitory is correct or not,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cTransitory\u201d is how the Fed describes its view that the surge in inflation will be short-lived.\n*****\n> In the past week, some of the inflationary pressure in the market dissipated with a major sell-off across the commodities complex. The Fed\u2019s policy talk helped spur a surge in the dollar, which was part of the reason for the selling. But the first catalyst was a move by China to cool the hot commodities markets. Reuters reported that a Chinese government agency planned to release reserves of aluminum, copper and zinc.\n*****\n> Copper was down more than 8.4% on the week, its worst week since March 2020.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/QeDvubB.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/c4mOFUy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/nfckMPA.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/7H0ZZUf.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/JBlGnli.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OYV6vlW.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GCWxRIe.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WstlP83.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xNqbPVY.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nyNirM8.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IkwhPC6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/J7KAQ4b.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/yEBCfYQ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Down Triple Witching Weeks Trigger More Weakness Week After\n\n> As stocks continue to sell off on this Q2 Triple Witching Friday it is a good time to review the history and the pattern of down Triple Witching Weeks triggering more weakness the week after. This phenomenon is detailed on page 106 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac page 2022. The updated table of the four annual DJIA TWWs is pictured here.\n\n> The most important fact to note is that the week after TWW is the worst in Q2 \u2013 down 26 of the past 30 years since 1991. Down TWWs not only trigger weakness the week after, but that trend is most pronounce in Q2 and Q3 \u2013 the quarters within the Worst Six Months. Since 1991, of 39 down TWWs, 27 following weeks were also down. But in Q2 10 of the 12 down TWWs were followed by a down week after and it\u2019s 11 of 12 in Q3.\n\n> Proceed with caution next week. And Happy Father\u2019s Day to all the dads!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/722621168e16fd8f0481b3814ac465a9/13339cd31fcce957-b1/s500x750/1fdc67c74f34e17bdc0587af331eda5a373860da.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Big Drops In The Percent of Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs\n\n> In yesterday's Sector Snapshot, we highlighted how the internals of several sectors have weakened dramatically in recent days. One such measure in which there are drastic differences versus a couple of weeks ago is the reading on the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs. In the charts below, we show the changes in this reading across sectors and for the broader S&P 500.\n\n> As shown, the two sectors which have seen the largest share of their stocks fall below the support of their 50-DMAs are Financials and Materials. Two weeks ago, both of these sectors boasted some of the strongest readings of all sectors, but through yesterday, those readings have fallen over 60 percentage points. Meanwhile, Energy and Real Estate have seen almost all of their stocks trade above their 50-DMAs over the past two weeks without much change. While the declines were not as dramatic as Materials and Financials, Industrials and Consumer Staples have also seen a significant share of their members fall below their 50-DMAs. While most sectors have seen a decline in this reading, Tech and Health Care have been notable standouts with both sectors having more stocks above their 50-DMAs now than two weeks ago. This is indicative of the rotation that has been going on underneath the surface throughout the entire bull market that began when the S&P made its 2020 low after the COVID Crash last March.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061821-50-DMA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Leading Indicators Continue to Forecast Growth\n\n> As the economic focus has frantically shifted from inflation concerns to peak growth fears to the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) tightening timeline in recent weeks, it can be helpful to take a step back and assess the broad economic trend with a diversified set of indicators.\n\n> Through this lens, we are encouraged by the latest reading of the Leading Economic Index (LEI), which strongly suggested that economic growth would continue at a strong clip in the near-to-intermediate term.\n\n> On Thursday, June 17, the Conference Board released its May 2021 report detailing the latest datapoint for the LEI, a composite of ten data series that tend to lead changes in economic activity. Many economic data points are backward looking, but we pay special attention to the LEI, as it has a forward-looking tilt to it and spans many segments of the economy. The index grew 1.3% month over month, building on the strength seen in recent months since flirting with negative territory in February.\n\n> \u201cThree consecutive monthly gains in excess of 1% tend to be rare, and in fact, we never experienced that coming out of the 2008 recession,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat we have seen this dynamic twice now exiting the trough of the most recent recession speaks to the speed and strength of the recovery. We certainly understand near-term jitters, but we expect broader economic trends to remain positive over the intermediate term, consistent with the LEI\u2019s message.\u201d\n\n> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI has shown strong growth the last three months after limping through the second half of winter.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.18.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**\n\n> Seven of the ten components grew in May, while two fell and one remained unchanged. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, the ISM New Orders Index, and the interest rate spread represented the three largest contributors. Building permits and manufacturers\u2019 new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft detracted from the overall index\u2019s performance, while average weekly manufacturing hours held steady.\n\n> Strong breadth among the underlying components reinforces our view of continued economic strength. While supply chain bottlenecks and a slower-than-desired labor market recovery have acted as near term speedbumps, we expect those dynamics to largely self-correct and propel the economy further in the second half of the year. Reopening effects are snowballing, and we believe ever-increasing vaccination numbers, warmer weather, and the potential for strong employment growth later in 2021 warrant continued optimism for this economy.\n\n*****\n\n> # Citi Surprise Indices Surging But Not Everywhere\n\n> It is a boring start to the week with nothing on the docket for earnings, Fed speakers, or economic data. With regards to the latter, the slate will pick up tomorrow with several US releases including retail sales, PPI, industrial production, and more. Expectations for tomorrow's releases are a bit mixed relative to the prior readings in each indicator, but overall, recent US data has been beating expectations at a healthy rate. The charts below show the Citi Economic Surprise indices for a variety of global regions and the US. Positive readings in these indices indicate economic data is coming in above forecasts, and vice versa for negative readings. Additionally, higher positive or negative readings would mean that economic data is exceeding or coming up short of those forecasts by a wider margin.\n\n> Currently, the US index is well off record levels from the past year, but it has bounced since the start of June. The index has risen 42.7 points in the ten days from the end of May to last Friday. That move stands in the top 2% of all 10-day changes since the index began in 2003. That also comes not even a full month after the index saw its first negative reading in a year. While the negative reading was far from anything extreme, the sharp rebound has been impressive, leaving the index at a historically healthy level in the 83rd percentile.\n\n> The US is not alone in having seen a rebound. Although it is similarly off the peak from last summer and generally trending lower since then, the global index has consistently sat at the high end of its historical range over the past year. The current reading is still in the top 1% of all periods, and the move higher over the past ten days is again dramatic ranking in the top 5% of ten-day changes in the index's history. While the jump in the US index has likely played at least some part in this, other regions around the world are also pulling weight having seen just as, if not more, significant moves. Sticking with a look at the move over the past ten days, the gains for the indices covering APAC and Central/Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa all rank in the 98th percentile while the move in the index tracking Latin American countries ranks in the top decile. Each of these indices now sits in the top 1% or 2% of their historical ranges. One outlier region not contributing to the pickup in the global index has been Europe. While the Eurozone index is far from weak, it has not seen much of a move higher recently as other regions have.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061421-CESI-Regions.png))**\n\n> Likely thanks to the weakness in Eurozone countries, a similar dichotomy can be seen comparing the indices for major developed economies (the G10 members) and emerging market countries. While the index tracking major economies has simply held up at healthy levels, the emerging markets index has leaped to new record highs, breaking well above the previous records set earlier in the pandemic. BRIC countries in particular are some to thank for that sharp move higher as the index has seen one of its largest short-term moves on record.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061421-CESI-EM.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # June Quarterly Options Expiration Week and After Historically Volatile\n\n> The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last eighteen years, but down five of the last six.\n\n> Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 27 of the last 31 years with an average performance of \u20131.14%. S&P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 31-year span, declining 0.79% and 0.29% respectively on average.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/141a2a5cc757b0258359ef263f470d91/40704b63ac1ec12f-d2/s500x750/ee86f4713788c515bd122988f5c985ef05532feb.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9d41367baa02618174dc7702572999ad/40704b63ac1ec12f-25/s500x750/111c5f72fa726e8c8a34ba1f7c4c85b920df1064.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f92b0fab413284d3f5b71c9e6ebffef5/40704b63ac1ec12f-6e/s500x750/d8a03a5d3da450d13a7a4d98acea5011e421aa94.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Sentiment Shaky\n\n> Although there has not been any sort of dramatic breakout to the upside as the index has fallen over the past few days, the S&P 500 did manage to tag new record highs in the past week for the first time since May 10th. The record-high milestone has done little to shift sentiment though. The AAII survey of individual investor sentiment saw its reading on bullish sentiment rise 0.9 percentage points to 41.1%. While higher, that is still three points below the reading from just a couple of weeks ago.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061721-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n> The biggest move was in neutral sentiment as that reading fell 6.4 percentage points to 32.7%. That is the lowest reading in over a month and marked the biggest drop in neutral sentiment since the week of April 8th. Even though that was a big drop, neutral sentiment remains slightly elevated versus the historical average (31.42%) and especially relative to what has been the norm over the past year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061721-AAII-Neut.png))**\n\n> The past couple of weeks have seen historically muted readings on bearish sentiment. While that is still the case with this week's readings remaining at the low end of its historical range, bearish sentiment saw a big 5.5 percentage point gain rising to 26.2%. That one-week uptick in bearish sentiment was the largest since last September. It also marked the first time since the end of last month that over a quarter of respondents reported as bearish. While the move was not nearly as large, the Investors Intelligence survey echoed that increase in bearish sentiment with the bull-bear spread in that survey falling from 38.3 to 37.8 after inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment. In other words, broadly speaking, optimism has appeared to have peaked for the time being.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061721-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/I65Tz5o.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 6.21.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Monday 6.21.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  6.22.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9Hkdz07.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 6.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 6.23.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bqfPKzo.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 6.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XDze5WZ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 6.24.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FBtMRmq.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 6.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/7xcKWik.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 6.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/nXBoxxn.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 6.25.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n> **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n> #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets.", "id": "o32zxu", "created_utc": 1624058596.0, "score": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "Damn you don\u2019t have any free time do you?

Their main utility is that it theoretically allows us to continue to use a central line that has developed bacterial colonization. The problem with this is in hospital settings, when a patient develops a suspected CLABSI, we typically make the diagnosis by removing the catheter and test it for evidence of bacterial colonization. Also, we typically remove it regardless, as a potential source.

I've performed hundreds, and have seen thousands performed. \n\nIf Mino-Lok was able to prevent CLABSIs, I'd be all ears, but having to replace a CVC is not a big deal, and likely most physicians would opt with removing the source of infection rather than potentially leaving the source in and risking significant liability if the patient has a bad outcome.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Ah, that all makes a lot of sense.

{"title": "CVM premiums... am I missing something here? Has anybody else been printing money off these absolutely insane premiums?", "selftext": "My account size is relatively small so high volatility options are the only things worth my time to sell. I look at option data, strike premium and prob OTM mostly, and if the numbers say its a good deal I look at the chart to see just how much of a crap show this high volatility stock I just learned about 5 min ago is. This is usually where I see why the premiums are so fat, and I go from seeing dollar signs to seeing a steam roller just waiting for me to pick up some pennies.\n\nSometimes however, I will find what I consider to be the perfect put to sell.  The strike is far from being in the money and low enough for my account size to handle, the bid price is on a totally different level to any other options with similar strikes, and the prob OTM is well within my comfort zone. Even the charts look good, the strike lies well below the lowest price the stock has hit in over a year. Basically, people are paying top dollar to bet on this stock to just absolutely nose dive, anything less than the most extreme bearish movements and I win. Don't you just love it when the odds are heavily in your favor?\n\nFor me, CVM is the stock that fits this description perfectly. Since I discovered this ticker through a high volatility stock scan in November, it has been my premium printing machine. At the time I first found it, stock price was trending around $11-13 and I sold my first CVM put at a 10 strike for .60 with about 30 days left. Its close, but the stock hadn't dropped below $10 since January. Almost every other high volatility stock I was looking at had attractive strike bids because they showed no hesitation dipping below the strike, and the premiums were cheaper despite this. Contrarily, CVM puts are more expensive for a strike that the stock hasn't touched in a very long time, and still hasn't even come close to touching yet.\n\nFast forward to today, and CVM has only become more volatile, however it still hasn't come close to touching 10. Its currently up to about $21 which is shocking, but even more shocking is the fact puts at a 10 strike are STILL going for the same juicy premiums. Yesterday I sold another 10 strike put with 30 days left for .65, its literally more expensive than it was when the stock was just a couple dollars away from the strike. Thats what I call a good deal. I also sold 2 7.5 strike puts expiring the 16th for .40 each, again the stock is at $21. Thats like a 80% drop or something happening in a month just to bring me down to break even, absolute insanity. Even the 5 strike has buyers for .20, but I like to play it dangerous with 7.5 and 10 strikes mostly. Maybe 12.5 if I'm really feeling wild.\n\nSince November I have sold monthly CVM puts at the 7.5 and 10 strikes for around the same premiums I mentioned above, usually 3 or 4 at a time and have made about $1000 total from CVM premiums alone. Thats basically 10% of my current account balance which seems like a hell of a return to make in 8 months to me, especially for the relative low risk I feel I have to take on. Easily the most money I've made off of a single stock is CVM, and I have never owned a single share. God I love selling puts.\n\nThe insane distance between strike and market price makes these contracts just absolutely bleed premium, every day the stock doesn't make a 50% drop the option loses significant value. Red days are never red enough, and green days are just icing on the premium cake. If the whole stock market is down, my CVM puts are up, even when CVM is down. Its a nice light hedge to my account, everything else may be red but you better believe my short CVM put are lit up green like a Christmas tree. The great CVM crash delayed yet another day, CVM option buyers everywhere lose millions.\n\nTo end this, what exactly am I missing here with CVM? Is total bankruptcy actually a massive possibility? Who are these morons paying $40 cash for a strike thats nowhere near market price and hasn't been touched in a long time? Am I moron for selling near 300% volatility options? I feel like I never see this stock mentioned much at all, maybe because recommending high volatility stocks can be irresponsible advice, but the premiums some of these strikes are going for are unreal. .65 for a 10 strike when the stock is at $21... thats like beyond selling FD's to WSB, I'm selling dreams to idiots, or somebody with a massive CVM position just wants their entire portfolio insured by puts. Either one is fine by me, just keep that premium coming baby.\n\nOh yea, I also couldn't tell you exactly what CVM even does as a business. Some kind of biopharm research I think, I'm not gunna waste time pretending to understand. It doesn't really matter especially for short term trades like these, volatile stocks are going to do whatever they want in the short term and no amount of technical or fundamental analysis is going to be reliable. Instead of hopeful speculation buying a stock, playing the odds with short options allows you to customize your risk/reward and gives you real numbers/probabilities to base trade decisions off instead of theoretical analysis and your gut feeling.", "id": "o2d8xy", "created_utc": 1623979617.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 42, "comments": [{"body": "The deal is they are basically waiting on data the will make or break their company.

{"title": "MYOV - A De-risked Fire Sale With 2 FDA Approved Drugs and More Coming Through The Pipeline", "selftext": "Myovant has been hard at work. Leveling up in silence. While big pharma takes note and institutions build positions.\n\nAs a disclaimer, before we get started. Im not a financial advisor, I am long myovant ( Positions: 23k Shares and \\~250 xcalls mostly leaps), and there\u2019s serious value to be had in this play. Please also see my previous posts for more information as well.\n\n[Post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mlok9n/myov_deep_value_and_possible_buy_out/)\n\n[Post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nek6rk/myov_back_to_back_catalysts/)\n\n**Quick about the company:** \n\nMyovant is a company specializing in Men and Women's health. Currently, they have 2 approved treatments by the FDA, both based on a GNRH antagonist for the treatment of prostate cancer and uterine fibroids, all received in the past 6 months. Now, the company is beginning a full transformation to commercialization. In this, the treatment for prostate cancer has seen a rapid uptick in sales with product margins of over 1000% and Myfembree launching with the help of Pfizer this week.\n\n**Partners and investors:** \n\nPfizer -\u00a0\n\nArguably the most important.\u00a0[PFE and Myovant signed a deal](https://www.biospace.com/article/myovant-shares-rocket-22-percent-on-news-of-pfizer-deal/)\u00a0in December worth more than $4.2b! This deal came with 2 important notes.\n\n1. Cost, revenue, and resource sharing - this has proved incredibly important as it has allowed myovant to have 2 sales teams and a foot in the door, providing the aforementioned rapid sales growth.\n2. Cash payments on a tiered system with double digit royalties if pfizer exercises their rights to serve any of the ex-us markets granted by the deal.\n\nSumitomo (Sumitovant) -\n\nCurrently holding 53.5% of the company, they make the largest investor by far. They were able to acquire an initial stake from Roivant and have increased their stake since with another planned purchase of over a million shares coming before the end of the year. They are also very likely to buyout the company, but this is explained in more detail down below.\n\nOther Institutions -\n\nTheres a nice large chunk of other institutions like Takeda (held by ark) and a few others who own a position here. In fact, so many other institutions are holding, that the shares available to retail are about 5% of the company! To put that into perspective, amc is an 80% retail float. Follow the big money here.\n\n**The current valuation:** \n\nRight now, the current market cap from a very basic perspective is sitting at $1.8b. The company currently has $725m of this in cash with more to come upon completion of future milestones from Pfizer (management has called these \"Achievable\" in past calls) as well as sales from their drug. This means the company is sitting on close to 40% of its market cap in cash.\n\nTo expand, each of the use cases approved is expected to see more than 1b a year in net revenue within the next few years.\u00a0So what do analysts on WS think? Consensus is in mid 30s (50% more than current)\u00a0[with Evercore ISI projecting a $55 PT and another firm at $42!](https://www.markets.co/analysts-have-conflicting-sentiments-on-these-healthcare-companies-constellation-pharmaceuticals-nasdaq-cnst-myovant-sciences-nyse-myov-and-surgalign-holdings-nasdaq-srga/321463/)\n\nValue is the name of the game here\u00a0Looking at the share price and chart, you might say, oh man, why has this dropped? Good question, and good news. There has been no significant news in the past 2 weeks causing a price change. It is my theory that intraday shorting has dropped the price of the stock to a point for a big investor (possibly goldman sachs who seemed very bullish on their last call but doesn't have a position) could make an entrance.\n\n**The future prospects:**\n\nBy the end of June they are expected to submit an NDA for relugolix for the treatment of Endometriosis. This is likely to be approved as their data has been incredibly strong (triple threat) and they already have relugolix approved on the market. Further, the company has 2 peer reviewed publications on relugolix in the New England Journal of medicine for its possibility as a standard of care treatment.\n\nIf you go and look at the end of the [RFP](https://res.cloudinary.com/pcf/image/upload/v1623079191/FINAL_PCF-PFE-MYOV_Relugolix_Challenge_Awards_RFP_vlte5l.pdf) recently published, they are currently exploring Relugolix as a treatment for hormone induced breast cancer. Within this, they are also exploring other opportunities for relugolix with the help of Pfizer.\n\nMVT - they are exploring this compound and seeing positive data for the treatment of infertilityMyovant has also confirmed that they are shopping for other compounds to purchase and add to their already strong pipeline.\n\n**List of catalysts:**\u00a0I am keeping a list of future possible catalysts for the company. It should be noted that these catalysts are only the short term ones to keep the list short.\n\n1. Endometriosis submission to FDA\u00a0 \u00a0\n2. Announcement of further relugolix lifecycle development\n3. Proxy filing - (likely to come in June or july similar to last year) we should learn details about Lynn\u2019s departure and more importantly, payout\u00a0\n4. Part D and Medicare coverage for prostate cancer application - expected in first half of year (any day now)\u00a0\n5. EMA decision to approve for uterine fibroids for sale in EU (positive CHMP recommendation makes this highly likely and comes with multimillion dollar direct cash payment)\u00a0\n6. Pfizer optionality - Pfizer can opt in to sell in EU. Resulting in a 50m cash payment\u00a0\n7. Possible acquisition of new drug pipelines\u00a0\n8. Data read outs for the current trials\u00a0\n9. Q2 earnings - (expected in august)\u00a0\n10. Possible acquisition of myovant\n\n**Buyout possibility:**\u00a0Sumitovant (mentioned above) has a very strong interest in aquiring myovant. This can be assumed for 3 reasons.\n\n1. They have purchased 4 out of 5 of the \"Vants\"\u00a0[from their deal with roivant](https://www.evaluate.com/vantage/articles/news/deals/sumitomo-takes-out-urovant-and-myovant-beckons).\n2. They have a patent cliff on their current pipeline that expires in 2023 and by IFRS standards they can only claim the amount of revenue to their books in comparison to the stake they own\n3. They have shown in multiple investor presentations that they have plans to acquire Myovant.\n\n**Last but not least, fuck the shorts:**\n\nIt should be noted that the companies who are short myovant are the very same ones short $GME $AMC and other notable names. The list includes; citadel, Jane Street, Point 72, Susquehanna, and more!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/margpiml8x571.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=55e4b06fbe4868b44d566a791536a2dad6d9d96c\n\nOne more note: Fuck Cancer.", "id": "o2ciol", "created_utc": 1623977262.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|11|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|74|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2ciol/myov_a_derisked_fire_sale_with_2_fda_approved/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2cgqk/myov_a_derisked_fire_sale_with_2_fda_approved/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mlok9n/myov_deep_value_and_possible_buy_out/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mq5wlw/xbi_107_short_interest_from_hfs_including_citadel/) \n**Account Age**|2 years ago|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46531474590301514}, {"body": "I bought a few\u2026simply because I have endometriosis AND my dad has prostrate cancer.

COVID killed the demand for [chocolate](https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/17944-covid-19-eats-away-at-global-cocoa-demand), but with airports and hotels and boutiques going back up, candy bars will be flying off the shelves. Tl;dr: The demand for chocolate tracks the popularity of anal sex,\n\n# I don't particularly like Anal sex, why should I invest in Hershey?\n\nTighten your asshole, grab a hot cocoa, and [read this 10K](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000119312511039789/d10k.htm). To my dismay, this thing had a lot more than 10k words, but I did the hard research and selected the most important part to share here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Kit Kats? Kisses? Reese's? TWIZZLERS?](https://preview.redd.it/ljpqwuzo81671.png?width=1227&format=png&auto=webp&s=81cdc54c472cf1911d365d7ccdb0d67542f0b628)\n\nWhen you look at these products you realize that ***Hershey's is a movie theater play***. If you're long AMC you should be long HSY, because who doesn't buy TWIZZLERS at the movies? WHOPPERS? MOUNDS? Mr. fuckin' GOODBAR?\n\n# What was that about slavery?\n\nThat's right, [we use child labor](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/12/mars-nestle-and-hershey-to-face-landmark-child-slavery-lawsuit-in-us) to farm cocoa. There are some obvious benefits to child labor. Hershey's is giving these kids valuable real life skills and experience while lowering the cost of labor. This is really empowering the children, but for some reason HSY doesn't market it as such. I guess that's our little secret, and it's how you can effect societal change with this play. By buying Hershey you are supporting children in other countries striving for a better life. This isn't just some monkeys, these are real humans that might be allowed to eat a couple Almond Joys if the underlying goes up enough.\n\n# What was that about fat people?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A warrior for the cause.](https://preview.redd.it/qgcte3vs81671.png?width=408&format=png&auto=webp&s=4679ea7e165eccc209f7123bad3e73bff0bffff0)\n\nThe rate of obesity in America is incredible. Blue whales are choking on us. It's ridiculous. What do fat people love? Candy. But most people only buy candy when they're out, at the gas station or supermarket or travelling. Fat people especially know they can't just hoard candy or they'll eat it all and catch a coma. Now that most of America is vaxxed and people are out and about again, candy consumption will shoot up. Anecdotally, I bought some Reese's today at Wawa.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[People are fat.](https://preview.redd.it/d62y8htu81671.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=291889bdda0dc9242653e03f48237222e5c6d33a)\n\n# Life is like a box of chocolates, it doesn't last as long for fat people\n\nI have established a correlation between obesity, anal sex, analingus aka rimming, and chocolate consumption. The bullish trend lines for all of the above are irrefutable proof that Hershey will be 200 by the end of the year. This is the summer of brown gold. Hershey's costs have stayed low thanks to slavery while revenue has gone up thanks to inflation.\n\n[Mods trying their best.](https://preview.redd.it/mysvxcx091671.png?width=441&format=png&auto=webp&s=af2891ed342f4942a212b86e4f1c533ccc447a01)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HSY\ud83d\ude80HSY\ud83d\ude80HSY\ud83d\ude80HSY\ud83d\ude80HSY\ud83d\ude80HSY\ud83d\ude80**\n\nHERSHEY HIGHWAY ASSHOLE RIM PLAY\n\n**HSY\ud83d\ude80HSY\ud83d\ude80HSY\ud83d\ude80HSY\ud83d\ude80HSY\ud83d\ude80HSY\ud83d\ude80**\n\nPrice target $190 by July 16", "id": "o2qafo", "created_utc": 1624026263.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 42, "comments": [{"body": "Reflairing as shitpost.

{"title": "Rite Aid ( RAD ) Earnings Due Out Next Week - June 24, 2021. Strong results due to COVID-19 vaccinations administered could be a catalyst for the stock price to climb higher.", "selftext": "As we head into next week (week of Jun 21, 2021) with Rite Aid ( $RAD ) set to report fiscal Q1 earnings of Thursday, June 24th, some points to consider:\r  \n\r  \n1) The market cap of the stock is now right around one billion dollars. Does that sound reasonable for a company with $24 billion in annual revenue, positive cash flow, and $8 per share in adjusted EBITDA last year (during a COVID-19 stressed year, no less)?\r  \n\r  \n2) The company provided guidance for the new / current Q1 of their 2022 fiscal year and indicated a break-even result +/- $10 million. This represents a net earnings improvement of $63 to $83 million versus the prior year.\r  \n\r  \n3) RAD management indicated they had administered 2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine during the first six weeks of the new / current fiscal year. Through the first half of the year, it appears 6 million doses will likely be delivered by Rite Aid. This will result in $210 million in incremental revenue and $2 per share to net earnings. Also, Pfizer's CEO mentioned today (April 15, 2021) that a third booster coronavirus shot will likely be required and that we should expect the COVID-19 vaccine to be administered annually like the flu shot.\r  \n\r  \n4) The short attacks on the stock have ramped up against RAD recently.  Short interest is up to 15.5% of the total outstanding shares.  That represents 8.33 million shares short.  Institutions, mutial funds, and insiders own more than 60% of the total shares outstanding.  That means that 35.8% to 46.3% shares are short excluding ownership by institutions, mutual funds, and insiders.  **Positive earnings on June 24th could be a catalyst for a major squeeze.** \r  \n5) The Bartell Drugs acquisition closed at the start of 2021.  While it is unlikely to contribute materially to net earnings during the current fiscal year, it is expected to do so next year. The acquisition makes Rite Aid the pharmacy leader in the Seattle market.\r  \n\r  \n6) Year-to-Date high share price is $32.48 and there are only 55 millioin shares total outstanding.\r  \n\r  \n7) The company has $3.1 billion in debt, which is being adequately managed (---meaning Rite Aid was able to service the debt, buy Bartell drugs, and still maintain positive cash flow last year). For the new / current fiscal year, it appears likely that Rite Aid is positioned to book positive net earnings and cash flow (improving cash flow even further).\r  \n\r  \n8) Break-up value of the company is estimated to be in the range of $40 - $50 per share.  This despite a current share price of under $21.  \n\n\rDoes this sound like a company that should be trading at less than $21 per share with a market cap of just $1 billion?", "id": "o2ww7t", "created_utc": 1624041202.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 41, "comments": [{"body": "lmao, WSB has come full circle,", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Very true, very true.

This is conceivably an acquisition target too, no?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, I believe there are at least three (3) parties who would recognize significant strategic gains from an acquisition of Rite Aid:\n\n\\*\\*\\* Amazon ( $AMZN ) \\*\\*\\*\r  \n\r  \nCFRA Research group recently stated (Thursday, June 3, 2021) in its latest Rite Aid (RAD) analysis report:\r  \n\r  \n\"It would make more sense for AMZN to acquire a regional drug retailer like RAD to quickly establish a physical presence.\"\r  \n\r  \nAlso, it should be noted that there is already a partnership existing between Amazon and Rite Aid since July of 2019. Rite Aid was the first partner that Amazon selected for its retail in-store pick-up program called Amazon Counter. Here is the link for the launch of the program:\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-rite-aid/amazon-launches-new-in-store-pickup-option-with-rite-aid-as-first-partner-idUSKCN1TS0RI\r  \n\r  \nSo the companies are already coordinating some business activities to a minor extent.\r  \n\r  \nFinally, with the acquisition of Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid became the #1 retail pharmacy in Seattle, WA. Should Amazon buyout Rite Aid, AMZN itself would be able to cut out the middleman and provide cost effective prescription drug benefits to its 75,000 employees at the Seattle headquarters.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*\\* Walmart ( $WMT ) \\*\\*\\*\r  \n\r  \nWalmart is already a leading player in the retail pharmacy / prescription drug segment, and the category is a strategic growth target for the company. However, Walmart has nowhere near the presence in the pharmacy sector of either CVS or Walgreens. In order for Walmart to become competitive in this space, they have to increase their size and scale. If Walmart let's Amazon step up and become the third largest player in retail pharmacy, it's game over. WMT needs to move into this third position and block AMZN from doing so.\r  \n\r  \nA couple of the benefits of Walmart acquiring Rite Aid would be:\r  \n\r  \nWalmart would have double the purchasing power for prescriptions thereby lowering its overall drug cost, improving profitability\r  \n\r  \nAll the goods sold in the front-end of the 2,500+ Rite Aid retail pharmacies are the same products Walmart sells in its own department stores. Once again, when you buy larger quantities you get lower prices. This is a fact of the business world that I know first hand.\r  \n\r  \nBased on the above 2 points, Walmart would improve both its own existing margins and at the same time would improve those of the Rite Aid revenue through such an acquisition.\r  \n\r  \nThe Rite Aid PBM would help Walmart to capture much greater market share in the prescription market, thereby enhaning those gains even further.\r  \n\r  \nIf you look at Walgreens and CVS when they had approximately $25 - $30 billion in revenue, they were earning about $4 - 6 billion per year. Therefore, considering Walmarts expertise in running brick and mortar establishments, one could make the leap of logic that WMT would achieve similar profit levels. So an acquisition of RAD by Walmart essentially provides a 2-3 year payback on the investment.\r  \n\r  \nWhichever company, Walmart or Amazon, utlimately decides to buy Rite Aid, that corporation will instantly become the #3 retail pharmacy in the USA, and will be well-positioned to someday challenge CVS and Walgreens for the #1 or #2 spots.\r  \n\r  \n\\*\\*\\* Walgreens ( $WBA ) \\*\\*\\*\r  \n\r  \nAnother darkhorse in this whole race is Walgreens. This week, Walgreens completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen for $6.5 billion (---see link below this paragraph). This windfall gives WBA the needed funds to finally finish the takeover of Rite Aid that it started back in 2015. While that deal was ultimately blocked by the courts, no judge could reasonably claim today that there is insufficent competition to support consumers if the balance of Rite Aid was taken over by Walgreens (NOTE: WBA bought 1,900+ RAD stores in 2018, and RAD currently has 2,500+ stores remaining). With CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger, and numberous mail order prescription services (including Amazon), there is pleny of competition in the USA.\r  \n\r  \nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/walgreens-completes-divestiture-of-alliance-healthcare-to-amerisourcebergen-for-%246.5b-2021\r  \n\r  \nAn acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens would be a highly strategic move accomplishing the following:\r  \n\r  \n\\- Gaining more size and scale, thereby putting WBA in a much more competitive position with CVS\r  \n\r  \n\\- Giving Walgreens a PBM in Rite Aid's Elixir group that would help WBA gain more prescription drug business share compete more successfully in that category\r  \n\r  \n\\- Blocking both Amazon ( $AMZN ) and Walmart ( $WMT ) from acquiring Rite Aid thereby removing the threat of a financially powerful competitor moving into the #3 retail pharmacy spot in the USA.\r  \n\r  \nSo, it may very well be the case, that the race is on to see who will acquire Rite Aid!", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Brilliant write up here.

{"title": "Transocean $RIG: Energy Stock - 17% Short Interest - 6/18/21 Update", "selftext": "Position Update:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1flv5ugdi2671.png?width=259&format=png&auto=webp&s=25b2ebbcacba61c7e5eb8465887f1c16f61c90f6\n\nWhat Happened This Week:\n\nA bunch of positive developments happened for RIG this week. I'll list them briefly below in plain English.\n\n1. RIG signed two new contracts for $116mm of new backlog, a huge blow to the shorts who said it couldn't be done\n2. RIG announced a $460mm vendor financing deal with its shipyards, delaying the capex on the newbuilds until 2022, which substantially improves the company's liquidity, another huge blow to the shorts\n3. Board Member and Company Insider Frederick Mohn bought $5mm shares between $4.17 - $4.20\n4. Oil prices continue to move higher, even after Fed officials appear to be focusing on controlling rising inflation\n\nAnother development occurred which I view as neutral.\n\n1. RIG disclosed an \"At-The-Money\" mixed shelf offering of $400mm, which could include issuing more stock. However, the filing gives RIG maximum flexibility to help the company beat back the shorts. It's \"credit positive\" in that it allows RIG to avoid drawing on their corporate credit card and makes them a safer lender. It also gives RIG until 2023 or longer for the offshore drilling cycle to kick into gear, which is a lifetime in this business. With the shipyard financing deal they signed, RIG has no immediate need for cash, so there's zero chance they issue this equity today when their stock trades in the $3s. Further, an insider like Mohn isn't stupid. He knows this business is totally undervalued. I think his open market purchases of RIG stock on Jun 15 / 16 indicates that i) offshore drilling has bottomed and ii) the company is going to be supportive of shareholders. Buying today means you're buying into a super undervalued company with a 17% short interest at a cheaper price than a 12% shareholder with a ton of upside if things play out like I think they will.\n\n**Bottom Line: I think $RIG trades to $7 - $10 by October, if not sooner. The investment thesis has never been stronger. All signs continue to point to a massive win for $RIG.**", "id": "o2ym3o", "created_utc": 1624045691.0, "score": 61, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 49, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|24|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o2ym3o/transocean_rig_energy_stock_17_short_interest/) \n**Account Age**|10 months ago|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.34235477447509766}, {"body": "This is a sleeper stock.

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 21st, 2021", "selftext": "Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 21st, 2021.\n\n# **The Fed will continue to dominate the market in the week ahead after sell-off - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/the-fed-will-continue-to-dominate-the-market-in-the-week-ahead-after-sell-off.html)**\n*****\n> The Federal Reserve\u2019s signal that it is looking to step away from some of its easy policy is expected to be a dominant trading theme in the week ahead and likely for the rest of the summer.\n*****\n> In the past week, investors repositioned across the financial markets after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the central bank was considering tapering its purchases of Treasurys and mortgage securities. That is important since when the Fed eventually acts, it would be the first serious reversal of the easy policies it put in place to add liquidity to markets when the economy shut down last year because of the Covid crisis.\n*****\n> The purchases, which amount to $120 billion a month, would be gradually whittled away once the Fed decides to slow down and end the bond buying, or quantitative easing. That could then open the door to interest rate hikes, which the Fed now projects would come in 2023.\n*****\n> The Federal Reserve sent ripples across financial markets after its meeting Wednesday. The dollar jumped, stocks fell and bond yields moved to imply higher short-term interest rates in the future. The Dow fell 3.5%, its worst week since October. The S&P 500 was down 1.9% for the week, its worst weekly loss since February, and the Nasdaq lost just 0.3%, helped by a small weekly gain in tech.\n*****\n> \u201cI think the market is still digesting the Fed meeting,\u201d said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. Stocks were trading sharply lower Friday, after weakness Wednesday and Thursday. Yields fell on longer duration bonds, like the benchmark 10-year, but rose on the shorter duration 2- and 5-year notes.\n*****\n> The spreads between those shorter-duration notes and the 10- and 30-year bond yields narrowed dramatically in a so-called flattening trade. That\u2019s common when interest rates are rising. The higher short rates reflect the expected increases in the fed funds rate, while the longer duration yields fall, because the thinking historically has been that a tightening Fed slows the economy.\n*****\n> The Fed also provided new economic forecasts, including a chart on interest rates that shows it expects to hike its fed funds rate twice in 2023, after its prior forecast included no increases.\n*****\n> Fed speakers will get a lot of attention in the week ahead. Powell speaks Tuesday before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis on the Fed\u2019s policy response and the economy. His remarks could be a highlight of what looks to be a slow, but volatile first week of summer for markets.\n*****\n> There are a number of other Fed officials speaking, including New York Fed President John Williams on Monday and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, both Tuesday. Other Fed speakers include Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.\n*****\n> \u201cGetting more color from others will certainly be key,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Global Advisors. \u201cI\u2019m most interested certainly in what Powell has to say. They\u2019re all going to give us now the fine print of what was in the statement and what Powell said\u201d at the end of the Fed\u2019s June meeting.\n*****\n> There should be a lot of interest in personal consumption expenditures data next Friday, since it includes the PCE inflation index, closely watched by the Fed. The Fed has been pressing its view that elevated inflation readings are just temporary and that they should calm down next year.\n*****\n> Boockvar said the inflation data should reflect the same spike in prices that showed up in the consumer price index for May, up 5% year over year.\n*****\n> \u201cIt\u2019s going to show some pretty robust month-over-month increases,\u201d said Boockvar. He said inflation data will be the most important for markets.\n*****\n> \u201cThat\u2019s what the rest of the year is all about \u2014 inflation, inflation, inflation and how does the Federal Reserve adjust to that,\u201d he said. \u201cIn this inflation debate, it\u2019s not just a U.S. thing, it\u2019s a global thing.\u201d\n*****\n> While the Fed has now penciled in two interest rate hikes for 2023, the market is more skeptical about inflation. According to futures markets, investors believe there could be one or more rate hikes next year and at least four in total before the end of 2023.\n*****\n> The Fed forecast 3.4% PCE inflation for this year, up a full point from its March forecast, but it still expects a tame 2.1% pace next year.\n*****\n> Housing data will also be of big interest to markets, after the Fed\u2019s tiny step forward toward tightening unleased a surge in mortgage rates.\n*****\n> The rate for the 30-year fixed loan jumped to 3.25% by Thursday, the highest in months, according to Mortgage News Daily. The Fed is currently purchasing about $40 billion a month in mortgage securities, and that would slow down along with Treasury buying.\n*****\n> Existing home sales are released Tuesday, and new home sales are reported Wednesday.\n*****\n> # Value versus growth\n> Keon said the market is choppy but taking in stride the change in the Fed. He said he has overweight stocks in his portfolios. \u201cWe like that position with earnings likely to grow 40% this year, rates staying pretty low. That\u2019s a good environment for stocks,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> As the market traded lower this past week, tech and some growth names held their ground. Tech was barely positive, registering a nearly 0.1% gain for the week. The worst performing sectors were in the value space \u2014 commodities-related or part of the reopening cyclical trade.\n*****\n> Materials were down 6.3% for the week, and financials were down more than 6% as a flattening yield curve has the potential to hurt bank profits.\n*****\n> \u201cWe had a very good move for value stocks and for the reopening plays. They really did well for six months or so,\u201d said Keon. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the market that keeps going forever. This is probably a bit of a counter rotation. Whether it\u2019s the beginning of a major shift or a slight bounce back [for tech], is hard to say and rates are going to be a determinant.\u201d\n*****\n> Keon said if the closely watched 10-year yield goes to 2% from its current 1.5%, that would be a positive for value stocks. But if it stays anchored around 1.5%, tech could continue to do well.\n*****\n> The 10-year yield, which is the benchmark Treasury, fluctuated widely in the past week. After starting the week at about 1.45%, it moved higher right after the Fed meeting to as high as 1.59% but then fell back down to about 1.44% Friday afternoon.\n*****\n> The 2-year note yielded 0.256% on Friday, up sharply from the prior week\u2019s Friday close of 0.149%.\n*****\n> \u201cMy guess is that the thinking is that at the press conference, Powell made it pretty clear he has no intention of raising rates until 2023,\u201d said Keon. \u201cUntil you get to 2023, you\u2019re going to get the boom we are in now, and you\u2019re going to get pretty strong growth in 2022. By the time, you get to 2023, the economy is going to be slowing and is the Fed going to raise rates in a slowing economy? Probably not.\u201d\n*****\n> Keon said that would keep a cap on the size of the Fed rate hikes. He said there\u2019s little chance the Fed will hike before 2023 unless there\u2019s an upside surprise in inflation.\n*****\n> \u201cThe market thinks the Fed is not going to raise rates until 2023, absent an unexpected surprise to inflation, and that they\u2019re not going to raise rates that much in 2023 because they\u2019ll be risking a recession,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the Fed has now injected a new level of volatility into the markets. He expects investors will be on edge now as the Fed\u2019s late July meeting approaches and again as the Fed heads to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in late August for its annual symposium.\n*****\n> Many economists expect Jackson Hole to be the forum where the Fed releases details of the tapering program. Once the Fed announces it will cut back, it is then expected to wait a few months before slowly paring back the purchases over many months. The end of the easing program is important since it would then open the door to a potential rate hike, based on the strength of the economy.\n*****\n> \u201cThe narrative here is the markets are likely to continue going back and forth with regard to their view on the Fed assessment of whether transitory is correct or not,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cTransitory\u201d is how the Fed describes its view that the surge in inflation will be short-lived.\n*****\n> In the past week, some of the inflationary pressure in the market dissipated with a major sell-off across the commodities complex. The Fed\u2019s policy talk helped spur a surge in the dollar, which was part of the reason for the selling. But the first catalyst was a move by China to cool the hot commodities markets. Reuters reported that a Chinese government agency planned to release reserves of aluminum, copper and zinc.\n*****\n> Copper was down more than 8.4% on the week, its worst week since March 2020.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/QeDvubB.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/c4mOFUy.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/nfckMPA.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/7H0ZZUf.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/JBlGnli.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OYV6vlW.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/GCWxRIe.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/WstlP83.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/xNqbPVY.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nyNirM8.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/IkwhPC6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/J7KAQ4b.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/yEBCfYQ.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Down Triple Witching Weeks Trigger More Weakness Week After\n\n> As stocks continue to sell off on this Q2 Triple Witching Friday it is a good time to review the history and the pattern of down Triple Witching Weeks triggering more weakness the week after. This phenomenon is detailed on page 106 of the Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac page 2022. The updated table of the four annual DJIA TWWs is pictured here.\n\n> The most important fact to note is that the week after TWW is the worst in Q2 \u2013 down 26 of the past 30 years since 1991. Down TWWs not only trigger weakness the week after, but that trend is most pronounce in Q2 and Q3 \u2013 the quarters within the Worst Six Months. Since 1991, of 39 down TWWs, 27 following weeks were also down. But in Q2 10 of the 12 down TWWs were followed by a down week after and it\u2019s 11 of 12 in Q3.\n\n> Proceed with caution next week. And Happy Father\u2019s Day to all the dads!\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/722621168e16fd8f0481b3814ac465a9/13339cd31fcce957-b1/s500x750/1fdc67c74f34e17bdc0587af331eda5a373860da.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Big Drops In The Percent of Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs\n\n> In yesterday's Sector Snapshot, we highlighted how the internals of several sectors have weakened dramatically in recent days. One such measure in which there are drastic differences versus a couple of weeks ago is the reading on the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs. In the charts below, we show the changes in this reading across sectors and for the broader S&P 500.\n\n> As shown, the two sectors which have seen the largest share of their stocks fall below the support of their 50-DMAs are Financials and Materials. Two weeks ago, both of these sectors boasted some of the strongest readings of all sectors, but through yesterday, those readings have fallen over 60 percentage points. Meanwhile, Energy and Real Estate have seen almost all of their stocks trade above their 50-DMAs over the past two weeks without much change. While the declines were not as dramatic as Materials and Financials, Industrials and Consumer Staples have also seen a significant share of their members fall below their 50-DMAs. While most sectors have seen a decline in this reading, Tech and Health Care have been notable standouts with both sectors having more stocks above their 50-DMAs now than two weeks ago. This is indicative of the rotation that has been going on underneath the surface throughout the entire bull market that began when the S&P made its 2020 low after the COVID Crash last March.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061821-50-DMA.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Leading Indicators Continue to Forecast Growth\n\n> As the economic focus has frantically shifted from inflation concerns to peak growth fears to the Federal Reserve\u2019s (Fed) tightening timeline in recent weeks, it can be helpful to take a step back and assess the broad economic trend with a diversified set of indicators.\n\n> Through this lens, we are encouraged by the latest reading of the Leading Economic Index (LEI), which strongly suggested that economic growth would continue at a strong clip in the near-to-intermediate term.\n\n> On Thursday, June 17, the Conference Board released its May 2021 report detailing the latest datapoint for the LEI, a composite of ten data series that tend to lead changes in economic activity. Many economic data points are backward looking, but we pay special attention to the LEI, as it has a forward-looking tilt to it and spans many segments of the economy. The index grew 1.3% month over month, building on the strength seen in recent months since flirting with negative territory in February.\n\n> \u201cThree consecutive monthly gains in excess of 1% tend to be rare, and in fact, we never experienced that coming out of the 2008 recession,\u201d said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cThat we have seen this dynamic twice now exiting the trough of the most recent recession speaks to the speed and strength of the recovery. We certainly understand near-term jitters, but we expect broader economic trends to remain positive over the intermediate term, consistent with the LEI\u2019s message.\u201d\n\n> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI has shown strong growth the last three months after limping through the second half of winter.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.18.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**\n\n> Seven of the ten components grew in May, while two fell and one remained unchanged. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, the ISM New Orders Index, and the interest rate spread represented the three largest contributors. Building permits and manufacturers\u2019 new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft detracted from the overall index\u2019s performance, while average weekly manufacturing hours held steady.\n\n> Strong breadth among the underlying components reinforces our view of continued economic strength. While supply chain bottlenecks and a slower-than-desired labor market recovery have acted as near term speedbumps, we expect those dynamics to largely self-correct and propel the economy further in the second half of the year. Reopening effects are snowballing, and we believe ever-increasing vaccination numbers, warmer weather, and the potential for strong employment growth later in 2021 warrant continued optimism for this economy.\n\n*****\n\n> # Citi Surprise Indices Surging But Not Everywhere\n\n> It is a boring start to the week with nothing on the docket for earnings, Fed speakers, or economic data. With regards to the latter, the slate will pick up tomorrow with several US releases including retail sales, PPI, industrial production, and more. Expectations for tomorrow's releases are a bit mixed relative to the prior readings in each indicator, but overall, recent US data has been beating expectations at a healthy rate. The charts below show the Citi Economic Surprise indices for a variety of global regions and the US. Positive readings in these indices indicate economic data is coming in above forecasts, and vice versa for negative readings. Additionally, higher positive or negative readings would mean that economic data is exceeding or coming up short of those forecasts by a wider margin.\n\n> Currently, the US index is well off record levels from the past year, but it has bounced since the start of June. The index has risen 42.7 points in the ten days from the end of May to last Friday. That move stands in the top 2% of all 10-day changes since the index began in 2003. That also comes not even a full month after the index saw its first negative reading in a year. While the negative reading was far from anything extreme, the sharp rebound has been impressive, leaving the index at a historically healthy level in the 83rd percentile.\n\n> The US is not alone in having seen a rebound. Although it is similarly off the peak from last summer and generally trending lower since then, the global index has consistently sat at the high end of its historical range over the past year. The current reading is still in the top 1% of all periods, and the move higher over the past ten days is again dramatic ranking in the top 5% of ten-day changes in the index's history. While the jump in the US index has likely played at least some part in this, other regions around the world are also pulling weight having seen just as, if not more, significant moves. Sticking with a look at the move over the past ten days, the gains for the indices covering APAC and Central/Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa all rank in the 98th percentile while the move in the index tracking Latin American countries ranks in the top decile. Each of these indices now sits in the top 1% or 2% of their historical ranges. One outlier region not contributing to the pickup in the global index has been Europe. While the Eurozone index is far from weak, it has not seen much of a move higher recently as other regions have.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061421-CESI-Regions.png))**\n\n> Likely thanks to the weakness in Eurozone countries, a similar dichotomy can be seen comparing the indices for major developed economies (the G10 members) and emerging market countries. While the index tracking major economies has simply held up at healthy levels, the emerging markets index has leaped to new record highs, breaking well above the previous records set earlier in the pandemic. BRIC countries in particular are some to thank for that sharp move higher as the index has seen one of its largest short-term moves on record.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061421-CESI-EM.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # June Quarterly Options Expiration Week and After Historically Volatile\n\n> The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last eighteen years, but down five of the last six.\n\n> Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 27 of the last 31 years with an average performance of \u20131.14%. S&P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 31-year span, declining 0.79% and 0.29% respectively on average.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/141a2a5cc757b0258359ef263f470d91/40704b63ac1ec12f-d2/s500x750/ee86f4713788c515bd122988f5c985ef05532feb.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9d41367baa02618174dc7702572999ad/40704b63ac1ec12f-25/s500x750/111c5f72fa726e8c8a34ba1f7c4c85b920df1064.jpg))**\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/f92b0fab413284d3f5b71c9e6ebffef5/40704b63ac1ec12f-6e/s500x750/d8a03a5d3da450d13a7a4d98acea5011e421aa94.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Sentiment Shaky\n\n> Although there has not been any sort of dramatic breakout to the upside as the index has fallen over the past few days, the S&P 500 did manage to tag new record highs in the past week for the first time since May 10th. The record-high milestone has done little to shift sentiment though. The AAII survey of individual investor sentiment saw its reading on bullish sentiment rise 0.9 percentage points to 41.1%. While higher, that is still three points below the reading from just a couple of weeks ago.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061721-AAII-Bull.png))**\n\n> The biggest move was in neutral sentiment as that reading fell 6.4 percentage points to 32.7%. That is the lowest reading in over a month and marked the biggest drop in neutral sentiment since the week of April 8th. Even though that was a big drop, neutral sentiment remains slightly elevated versus the historical average (31.42%) and especially relative to what has been the norm over the past year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061721-AAII-Neut.png))**\n\n> The past couple of weeks have seen historically muted readings on bearish sentiment. While that is still the case with this week's readings remaining at the low end of its historical range, bearish sentiment saw a big 5.5 percentage point gain rising to 26.2%. That one-week uptick in bearish sentiment was the largest since last September. It also marked the first time since the end of last month that over a quarter of respondents reported as bearish. While the move was not nearly as large, the Investors Intelligence survey echoed that increase in bearish sentiment with the bull-bear spread in that survey falling from 38.3 to 37.8 after inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment. In other words, broadly speaking, optimism has appeared to have peaked for the time being.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061721-AAII-Bear.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!]())**\n(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/I65Tz5o.png))**\n\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 6.21.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n> # ***Monday 6.21.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  6.22.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9Hkdz07.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 6.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 6.23.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/bqfPKzo.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 6.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/XDze5WZ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 6.24.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/FBtMRmq.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 6.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/7xcKWik.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 6.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/nXBoxxn.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 6.25.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)\n> **(T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.)** (T.B.A. THIS WEEKEND.).\n\n> #([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=SPY&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l))\n\n*****\n\n# DISCUSS!\n\nWhat are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?\n\n*****\n\nI hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets.", "id": "o32zxu", "created_utc": 1624058596.0, "score": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "Damn you don\u2019t have any free time do you?
