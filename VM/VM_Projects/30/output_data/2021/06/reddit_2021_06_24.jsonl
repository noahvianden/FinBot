But if not :\n\nPanasonic Corp.\u2019s new President and Chief Executive Officer Yuki Kusumi is embarking on a two-year mission: churn out more batteries for Tesla Inc. and shake free billions of dollars to invest in new areas of growth by making the company more efficient.\n\nHe won\u2019t be doing that from the second-floor office used by the company\u2019s founder, a room overlooking a fountain and manicured lawn dotted with statues at Panasonic\u2019s Osaka headquarters. The 56-year-old, who rose through the engineering ranks, is shunning the space to work alongside staff.\n\n\nKusumi, who formally takes the helm of the 103-year-old Japanese company on Thursday, says he\u2019s focused on improving efficiencies from the manufacturing floor up. That type of work can\u2019t be done locked away in the president\u2019s office, he said in an interview earlier this month. \u201cThose are the type of things I\u2019m out to change.\u201d\n\nSome 20 years ago, Panasonic was topping global consumer electronics sales, with a hand in everything from televisions to digital cameras and mobile phones. In the years since, it\u2019s faced tightening margins and rising competition from rivals in South Korea and China. What\u2019s now critical to Panasonic\u2019s future growth is its relationship with the world\u2019s biggest maker of electric cars and ability to claim a share of the global market for EV batteries that\u2019s projected to reach $35.4 billion in 2023.\n\nPanasonic\u2019s change of guard follows a decade of unparalleled shifts for the company, which operated for most of its time as Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. before changing its name. Kazuhiro Tsuga, Panasonic\u2019s previous chief executive, spent close to nine years shedding struggling businesses, such as plasma TVs, and ultimately handed to Kusumi a leaner company no longer bleeding red ink. Now, it\u2019s Kusumi\u2019s job to steer Panasonic onto a path of growth.\n\nThe immediate plan is to spend two years \u201cspecializing and sharpening\u201d Panasonic\u2019s remaining businesses. As it transitions to a holding company, each business will be expected to operate more quickly and independently.\n\nBetter efficiency in operations such as manufacturing will increase Panasonic\u2019s ability to generate cash, in turn freeing up hundreds of billions of yen to direct toward new initiatives, including mergers and acquisitions. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019ll take two years, but we\u2019re pushing to reach that state,\u201d Kusumi said.\n\nMany of the struggles that Panasonic encountered supplying batteries to Tesla in the past stemmed from insufficient productivity, according to the new CEO. The high-flying automaker\u2019s oldest battery supplier in 2014 committed to invest in the multibillion-dollar battery factory the two jointly operate in Nevada. The years since have been contentious at points, with Panasonic facing frequent \u2014 and at times public \u2014 prods from Tesla CEO Elon Musk to boost battery production.\n\nThe automotive business, which made up about a fifth of Panasonic\u2019s 6.7 trillion yen ($61 billion) in revenue for the fiscal year through March, faced a long stretch of operating losses before turning profitable. Kusumi remembers working under \u201cintense pressure\u201d from customers.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter how much you want to grow sales or increase profit if you don\u2019t have the capacity to do so,\u201d he said. Going forward, the company will focus on raising plant operation rates as much as possible while automating processes and keeping facility costs low. \u201cWithin our new structure we\u2019re going to polish this ability and if you stay tuned we\u2019ll invest again in building supply capacity,\u201d Kusumi said.\n\nPanasonic is working to set up a prototype production line to test 4680 batteries \u2014 a next-generation lithium-ion cell touted as the key to unlocking cheaper and more ubiquitous EVs.

{"title": "NKLA to $0.00. Or the Moon. IDK", "selftext": "Howdy y\u2019all, welcome to a bad DD post, but first! Let me get my butt covered really quick\u2026 I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. If you continue to read, you will lose money whether you agree or disagree with this DD. This is all satire and I\u2019m making everything up. Upon writing this, I have had enough drinks to consider texting all my exes at the same time, especially the weird one.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Nikola, shall we? Other than being a bargain-bin Tesla knockoff, they\u2019re also one of the worst publicly traded companies to ever exist, including Theranos, Enron, and Worldcom. Basically, go watch Patrick Boyle\u2019s video on them and see all the sketchy things they\u2019ve done to pretend to be a real vehicle/tech company. However, instead of taking a nose dive into the ground, they have climbed up to $18.00 per share from their low of like $9.50 a few months back after their crash from $75. So, what\u2019s going on here? Is it time to but puts or calls? If you look at my post history, I am great at losing money on these kinds of questions.\n\nThe fundamentals:\n\nDisclaimer: For the purpose of this analysis, the environment doesn\u2019t matter. Sorry, but business is business. I hope for sustainable practices and want the world to be a cleaner and sustainable place, but that\u2019s currently not a line-item on the income statement.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the financials. Nikola has less revenue than the average ice cream truck. They\u2019re currently all sitting on the edge of their seats to see if they\u2019ll even be able to make a real vehicle that doesn\u2019t have to be rolled down a hill. And they\u2019re burning poopy tons of money doing this. At the end of 2020, they had about $900,000,000 in the bank. That\u2019s a lot of money, but how fast do they burn their Benjamins? According to their cash flow statement, they outflowed about $240,000,000 from Operating and Investing activities. Looking at their growth rate from 2018-2020, I\u2019m ballparking a 75% increase in operating negative cash flow expenses year-over-year, but indeterminant investing activity cash flows. Remember, they want to build a bunch of charging stations around the county because their trucks will only use their proprietary charging system. I have no idea what that would cost to put these stations around the USA, but I\u2019m imagining it\u2019s not written with 9 digits. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to be able to afford the infrastructure or even make a viable product work before they run out of money. Between the large capital expenditures required, the quick burn rate of cash, and the necessity to either leverage up with debt or issue more shares for money, I don\u2019t like the fundamentals for this company surviving. Cathy Wood also doesn\u2019t like it.\n\nNow let\u2019s look the team: Trevor Milton is gone. This is bullish because he\u2019s a fart-monger. If I had to guess, this is why the stock price has rebounded a little over the last few months. I can\u2019t find much on their new CEO Mark Russell, who picked up the gig from just being their President, so I\u2019m going to assume he\u2019s also pretty sus because he was around when all the sketchy stuff went down. I\u2019m probably wrong though, so he might turn this ship around. I\u2019m not seeing anything significant on anyone else in the company, so I\u2019m guessing they\u2019re irrelevant. Bearish.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the problem: What if it doesn\u2019t just go to $0.00 like it should? What if an army of retards decide that this dumpster fire is the next moonshot? I don\u2019t know those answers, but I\u2019m willing to take the risk and lose some money to find out if I\u2019m right or wrong. So how about the part everyone cares about?\n\nPuts or calls? This company doesn\u2019t belong on Wall Street. It belong on Shark Tank with a unanimous \u201cI\u2019m out.\u201d However, I know I\u2019m retarded and terrible at doing stock analysis. There\u2019s only like 4 numbers in my financial analysis, so it\u2019s gotta be bad. Therefore I\u2019m going to outsmart myself by buying some $20 Jan 2022 calls and get some some $10 Jan 2023 puts . It\u2019s either going up a lot or down a lot. Or I\u2019m just wrong, it just stays at $18, and I move into a nice tent under the bridge. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, my next appointment is waking up on my kitchen floor a few hours after my shift starts. Obligatory \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80. Even though I\u2019m thinking down.\n\nEdit: my position is in the reply to the mod comment. Exit plan: close call at 100% profit or Close put when the company delists.\n\nEdit 2: I put my brain to use and realized the big premium on my calls pretty much erases any potential gains on my puts, so I\u2019ll be looking to roll those into a cheaper and closer expiry if I can, like 1-2 months out rather than 7. These options are also pretty illiquid, so I may have just painted myself into a corner on this one.\n\nUpdate: rolled the call down to the October $19 call for $360.

{"title": "Citadel Capital Replenishment", "selftext": " If you find where they are hiding taking profits and take action to prevent any profit taking, the GME moon landing will happen. They can't be margin called if their capital is not reduced significantly. --\"But we are reducing their capital by buying and holding\"-- You were, but over the past year these hedge funds have invested in piggy bank stocks they are using to replenish that capital.\n\nCitadel has been using this particular stock as a piggy bank this year. Orchestrating wild swings with other HF's to pull profits on run ups and rundowns. I tried to post a screenshot of their latest 650,000 put but that just results in an instant post deletion. I tried posting a link to the data on fintel but that got the post deleted. Seems impossible to post DD data in this subreddit, so you'll have to do the legwork if you want to see proof of Citadels shorts on SRNE\n\nI know of this particular stock because I am a long term investor who has watched this play out over the past year. I guarantee you there are many other stocks they are playing this same game with. When GME goes up they loose capital, then they work over stocks like this one to replenish that capital loss.\n\nTo be clear this stock needs nothing from this sub, my investment will rise on it's own accord naturally over the next 3-5 years and that is just fine with me.\n\nHave you all consider figuring out how to stop the inflow of cash to these hedge funds. Unless you can cause a substantial capital decrease the margin call will never happen. As long as they have side stocks that are piggy banks the war will rage on indefinitely. Clearly buying and holding was an excellent phase 1 strategy, so what's the next phase of this movement?

{"title": "Mitigating Risks and Maximizing Returns using Collateral Plays - In Depth Trade Thesis", "selftext": "**Mitigating Risks and Maximizing Returns using Collateral Plays - In Depth Trade Thesis**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat\u2019s poppin\u2019 fellas, hope you\u2019re all doing well. Today, I\u2019m gonna teach you all about ***Collateral Trades***. Collateral trades provide us with an interesting way to dynamically adjust our risk profiles while placing trades and generate an edge while doing so! This strategy is most effective around earnings when IV is high, or if you want to safely play meme stocks. That being said, it can still find it\u2019s application during regular trading conditions as well. Let's get into it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#What is a Collateral Trade?\n\nIn its simplest terms, a collateral trade is a trade where you play a different ticker in the same sector as the one you initially planned on playing, ideally around a big event such as earnings. Since stocks within a sector generally tend to put up similar numbers and move together around earnings, we can abuse this to give us a more favourable risk to reward profile on our trades. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say that I\u2019m bullish on $JPM, and they report earnings this week. Instead of playing options on $JPM, I\u2019d look to make a play on $WFC, $BAC, or any other bank who reports earnings *after* $JPM instead. This allows us to reap most, if not all of the rewards if our trade goes in the direction we were anticipating, while severely mitigating our downside risk in the event that we were wrong.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#How does it work? What are the benefits?\n\nLet\u2019s walk through both situations! I'll continue to use the financial sector  in my first couple of examples.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**If I were to play standard options on $JPM**, I\u2019d be paying a pretty hefty premium because IV is high, and I would instantly get IV crushed right out the gate regardless of how $JPM performs. Furthermore, if $JPM moves in the *opposite* direction that I was anticipating, the value of my options would quickly approach 0, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to recoup much if any of my losses. If $JPM moves in the right direction, it would need to move enough to offset the IV crush of earnings, while also bringing in enough money to make the coinflip we call \u201ctrading earnings\u201d worthwhile. Realistically, you\u2019ve got a 50/50 shot at winning, but very rarely do you actually double your money off of a play like this. You\u2019re essentially playing a coin flip game where if it\u2019s heads, you lose 200$, but if it's tails, you win 50$. It\u2019s not a good look overall, but you still have the opportunity to make money nonetheless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**What if we were to employ some form of collateral play instead?** Instead of playing $JPM directly, let\u2019s play a ticker within the same sector as it who reports earnings *afterwards* - I\u2019ll use $WFC as an example. Generally speaking, stocks within a sector tend to move in tandem with one another price wise, while also putting up similar numbers to each other. It\u2019s very rare to see some stocks rally while others tank - generally they all rally or all tank depending on various market conditions. This also means that if certain stocks within a sector report earnings *before* the others, the market will price the *other* stocks differently following reported earnings from the first batch. If $JPM reports stellar earnings and rallies 4% as a result, $WFC and the other non-reporting banks will almost *always* follow suit and rally as the market prices in a good earnings beforehand from them as well. If we were holding $WFC calls, we would reap the rewards of a 4% rally ***without*** the IV crush, which means more gains in our pocket. Hypothetically, our $JPM calls may have only netted us 40% gain after the IV crush, but our $WFC calls would\u2019ve netted us an upwards of 100% if not more. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The same is true but on the flipside**. Let\u2019s say $JPM tanks on earnings. Our $JPM calls would swiftly approach 0. The other banks would also follow suit, but to a lesser degree. If we had $WFC calls instead, the IV on our contracts would actually go *up* by a decent amount. This would help offset our losses and we wouldn\u2019t have gotten IV crushed in the process. This in turn means that if we do want to bail out of the trade, we can recoup most if not all of our losses, which is extremely beneficial from a capital preservation standpoint.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**By utilizing a collateral play like this, we can increase the return of our winners, while simultaneously minimizing the losses of our losers.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#How can I incorporate them into my own Trades?\n\nI found that there\u2019s three ways you can consistently incorporate collateral trades into your own plays!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe first method is the one I went over above. **Find a set of tickers within the same sector who report earnings during the same week but on different days**. Instead of playing the ticker you have strong conviction on, play any of the adjacent tickers to avoid IV crush and reap any rewards you would\u2019ve gotten otherwise.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe second method is a little different. If you have a strong conviction on a certain sector as a whole, you can actually **look to make a play an an ETF which holds all of the reporting tickers instead**. ETFs are less susceptible to IV crush, generally have cheaper options, and always have a much lower IV than the individual tickers that they hold. I\u2019ve been using the financial sector for my examples, so I\u2019ll continue to roll with that. A few weeks ago, to kick off earnings season, 7 of the largest American banks were set to report earnings the same week as each other. Coincidentally, $XLF consists of 7 of the largest American banks. Every single bank usually sits at an IV of around 20%, but around earnings season, this gets jacked up to around 65%ish, resulting in options becoming 300% more expensive. At the same time, $XLF went from around 12% to 20%, meaning that options only got 66% more expensive. Since we know that tickers within the same sector move in tandem with each other, if we wanted to place a bet on an *individual* bank, we\u2019d actually be better off playing $XLF, since the options are cheaper, the IV is lower, and we can almost be certain that it will move as much as all the other banks will. If I was bullish on $JPM, I could play $XLF instead to reap the rewards.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The third and final way to utilize collateral plays involves meme stocks**. This method is a little less consistent, so I use a tool like [Hungry Bot](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/) to aid me in this. Oftentimes, when one of the major meme tickers starts to run (GME, AMC, etc), other meme tickers follow suit. The issue with this is that the instant one of the major memes starts to run, MMs jack the fuck out of the option prices so us retail traders cant make any money. In order to circumvent this, we can look to make a collateral play on some of the *minor* meme stocks instead - My personal favourite for this is $BB. Last time when AMC started running, the IV on most contracts got jacked up so fast that it wasn't worth playing, however, the IV on BB stayed low for a while. Instead of playing AMC, I ended up playing BB. BB ended up following AMCs price action for a while on a percentage point basis, though you had a much greater window of opportunity to enter a position and reap the rewards. Not to mention, since BB had a lower starting IV to begin with, you actually would have ended up with *better returns playing BB than you would have if you were playing AMC*. Although BB was very profitable, you could\u2019ve made this play with any other minor meme ticker so long as the IV was low upon entry, and they moved along with the other meme stocks. [**CLOV is another great example, which actually ended up being a 40 bagger**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794766298373423136/857753911855546399/clov.png) since we caught it well before it started running. Again, this method is a lot trickier to time and play manually, so I use my bot to alert me whenever a play like this is possible. It often catches the meme tickers before they run and usually spits out the most profitable collateral play while doing so.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Example Plays\n\nMost of the explanations found in this post were directly taken from *real* trades that I\u2019ve conducted, but I'll post them here again regardless.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Week one of earnings, I was extremely bullish on the financial sector as a whole. I ended up playing $XLF on April 12th and ended up catching nearly a 2% move in just two days. This may not seem like much, but on an ETF with an IV of 11%, I ended up getting a really solid return on my FDs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Week two of earnings, I was bearish on solar as a whole due to the semiconductor shortage. Since Enphase was reporting alongside First Solar, I decided to play puts on Canadian Solar instead, since they are in the same sector but don\u2019t report earnings until weeks after. Luckily for me my bet paid off, with Enphase tanking 15% and First solar closely behind with a 13% drop. My play, Canadian Solar, withered away 11% during that time, meaning I also secured a huge bag while walking away unscathed due to there being cheap options and no IV crush. If this play would have gone against me I would have had plenty of time to exit this play with minimal losses.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- Lastly, I played BB while AMC was mooning. [**The 10C was priced at $0.3**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794766298373423136/857753919539118120/bb.png). One week later, Blackberry touched 18$ and I I walked away with a clean 20 bagger. Not much to say here. I had a huge window of opportunity, and the writing was more or less on the wall after I watched AMC run nearly 20% on the day.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nAt the end of the day, trading is a difficult game!
