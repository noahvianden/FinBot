{"title": "The catch-22 with dividends", "selftext": "I am thinking lately about dividends. If a company gives dividends, then they are basically saying: \"we can't see any way to use our extra cash to grow the company further\". So if a company gives dividends it's actually a sign that the company has peaked and will just coast. \n\nBut then if a company swears off of dividends, refusing to ever give them in order to \"keep growing\", then the stock really no longer has any intrinsic value. The stock is now just a collectible traded on the open market. \n\nI noticed that some of the biggest companies don't pay out dividends (google and amazon don't). Do you think this is hubris on their part? You can't grow infinitely - there are only a finite number of resources in the universe. Don't you think that at some point a company should admit that it got adequately massive and should now just pay dividends? Or do you think companies should attempt to be in the growth phase forever?", "id": "ny2m4w", "created_utc": 1623488981.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.39, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "It\u2019s not an all or nothing thing.

Just like how we all came together and blew up meme stocks to the moon, society could randomly decide to crash amazon and google. Share price and market cap are based on supply and demand alone. We decide if we want to demand a certain stock. Why as a society should we demand a stock when the company stated that out of principle they will never share its assets with us?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You\u2019re missing a fundamental understanding of what stocks are, which makes sense if you only started to pay attention during the recent meme stock explosion. \n\nStock is ownership. When you own stock, you own the company. If you were wealthy enough to own 51% of the stock, you would be a majority owner and could bend the company to your will. In reality, 5% owners do this, often exerting control through board seats or influence over proxy voting. \n\nMaybe think of it this way. You own a lemonade stand. The lemons, the stand, and your profits add up to $100. You can take your profits out of the business (dividends) and use them to buy yourself a nice video game. Or you can plow your profits back into the business, maybe open another lemonade stand. Now let\u2019s say the value of your lemons, stands, and earnings are worth $200. If someone offers to buy your lemonade business, are you still going to sell your business for $100? No. You have two stands now and twice as many profits. Maybe you even have a good replicable model that will allow a third and fourth stand to be built cheaper and easier, so you value yourself at $350. That increase in value accrues to you because you can sell your company at anytime for a profit. \u201cSociety\u201d didn\u2019t decide your lemonade company was worth more\u2014math did. \n\nSame rules apply if you divide your ownership, sell only a portion of the business. You might structure the deal so the other owners receive a share of the profits, or they may buy because they see the potential growth in the company\u2019s value as being worth more than the quarterly earnings. If they bought in when the company was only two stands, and then the company expands to have a nationwide presence and millions in sales, they\u2019re not going to sell their stake for the same price they bought in\u2014the company is worth more. It makes more money. It\u2019s assets are more valuable. Hence the stock price will be too. \n\nYou seem to be hung up on the fact that cash flow from the business aren\u2019t going straight into the shareholders pockets. But this isn\u2019t true. The cash flows from the company could go anywhere, it\u2019s just the owners of the company decide where they go. Either back into the business to fuel growth and higher future cash flows/company value, or into Joe Shmuck\u2019s pocket who owns 2 shares that he bought on robinhood. For various reasons, majority shareholders usually believe putting capital back into the business is a better use of earnings than giving a retail investor a few pennies per share to spend on hookers and blow. In any case, owners are receiving the cash flows, the votes have just decided to spend that money on more lemons and stands instead. If the lemonade company gets sold to Pepsi for cash\u2014every stockholder gets paid out in cash. And if Pepsi is buying, you\u2019re not selling for that original $100 value. Get it?\n\nThis is why meme stocks are such a risk. No one honestly believes the assets and earnings are worth this much. Amazon isn\u2019t going to buy the Stop de Game for its current valuation. And basically everything needs to go phenomenally right for that particular\nCompany to ever be worth that valuation (though there are believers). So the price is mostly supported by speculation, not fundamentals. Millions of Joe Shmucks, manipulated by warring hedge funds and trust fund babies doing it for the lols. At any moment, a large holder could say, \u201cwait, someone is offering me a million dollars for a $100 lemonade stand?\u201d And choose to cash in.

I am new to stocks but I have taken the time to fundamentally think about what stocks are and why they are valuable. I am aware that they represent ownership in a company. If an investor owns a lemonade stand, then they'd be foolish to sell the company for $100 when they could liquidate the lemonade stand's assets for $200. But this simplified scenario probably doesn't exist for publicly traded companies. I'm not so sure that for google or amazon it makes sense to value the company by their assets/earnings when there is zero way to access that. An investor can't feasibly liquidate the company, and they can't even hope to receive any of the earnings when they are anti-dividend companies. They just have to hope that the market continues to value the company based on the assets/earnings despite not having any actual access to that.

If there is a dividend, you have a choice what to do with your share of the company earnings. You can take that dividend money, spend it somewhere else. You can buy a coffee. You can buy a video game. You can invest in another company. That\u2019s all your decision. \n\nIf there isn\u2019t a dividend, you are still getting a share of the company earnings. But you don\u2019t have a choice, the decision has been made for you (by the majority owners via the board and handpicked CEO). Instead of you putting that money in your pocket and spending it on whatever you want, that dividend you would have received instead goes towards something the company believes is worthwhile. Maybe they buy a lemon grove. Maybe they buy some new juicing machines. Maybe they spend more for a new talented lemonade engineer. Maybe they build their war chest to buy out their closest competitor. Bottom line, instead of you taking your dividend and doing god knows what, they\u2019re taking your dividend and growing the company. And assuming they make a wise decision, they make the company more valuable, because they either added valuable assets or added more earnings in the future. That added value is reflected in the share price, and that\u2019s where you benefit. If you want to take that money out, you can do it at any time, by selling a portion of your stock. \n\nI\u2019ll say it again, stock is ownership. Even if you have one share, you are an owner. You can show up to the shareholder meeting and vote if you want. Think that lemon grove is a dumb idea? You can vote on it! Sure, if you\u2019re small lemons, you can\u2019t influence anything. But larger investors definitely can. And you\u2019ll benefit from their decisions the same as they do. If they sell the company for cash, you get your share of the cash. If they make their shares more valuable by making the company more valuable, your share gets more valuable too. \n\nYes, sometimes valuations become detached from fundamentals.

I see that reinvesting money becomes a waste and when a company becomes huge they should shift their focus from growth to just maintaining their size/profits and providing income to investors. \n\nAnd I find it to be a fundamental negative that you're required to sell the company in order to profit from it.
