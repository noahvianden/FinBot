They are functionally identical to most other listed options, except with longer times until expiration. They were first introduced by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) in 1990, and are now ubiquitous.\n\n>\nAs with all options contracts, a LEAPS contract grants a buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell (depending on if the option is a call or a put, respectively) the underlying asset at the predetermined price on or before its expiration date.\n\n>\n**KEY TAKEAWAYS**\n>\n* Long-term equity anticipation securities (LEAPS) are listed options contracts that expire in more than a year.\n* These contracts are ideal for options traders looking to trade a prolonged trend.\n* LEAPS can be listed on a particular stock or an index as a whole.\n* LEAPS are often used in hedging strategies and can be particularly effective for protecting retirement portfolios.\n\n\nBasically, you buy a call option two years out.
