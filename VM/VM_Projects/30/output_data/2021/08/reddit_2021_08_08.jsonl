{"title": "SPY Strangle Puts or Puts Comments", "selftext": "IMHO, the investors are very cautious and uncertain currently judging from the mixed futures prices among the global market such as US (DJIA, SP500), Hong Kong (Hang Seng) and China. US futures normally have a positive correlation until recently where there are significant divergence from one another. The SPY recent price action also shows that its daily range are narrowing, a sign of market trading sideways, awaiting the next catalysts or bad news. \n\nMoreover, recently digested market data also indicates that analysts have overestimated the economic recovery from COVID with notables examples like Amazon and US NFP (Non-Farm Payroll) considerable negative variance. Central banks around the world are winding back their quantitative easing program and hinted at hiking up the interest rates. Current market headwinds are the lockdown (huge contributor to global demand), Delta COVID strain, central banks policy, trade war rhetoric and etc. \n\nFurthermore, bond yields (i.e. 5 and 10 years US treasury bonds) are decreasing which indicates that investors are moving their money in \u2018risk-free\u2019 government bonds because rising bond prices will reduce its yield (fixed coupon bond). US Dollar Index (DXY) has also risen tremendously recently and this signal a shift to lower risks assets such as bonds (USD priced government bonds) and away from share. Historically speaking, falling bond yields and a strengthening DXY normally indicates a correction might be incoming. SP500 has slowed recently and this trend could be attributed towards investors downgrading their valuation based on the recently announced earnings.\n\nIn relation to SPY, the price has been trading on the upper end of the Bollinger Bands but didn\u2019t show any signs of breaking out. The linear regression shows that the price is moving around its historical average (red line) and didn\u2019t show any signs of breaking out too. Those indicators supports the hypothesis that the market is unsure and waiting for a catalysts.\nUS is currently in earnings seasons and multiple companies earnings has been published and some of them are a disappointment (lower than estimates). US mining stocks underperform Global Sector Basic Material (MXI) average while its other sector like utilities and healthcare outperformed the Global sector after digesting the overall poor earnings results. Looking at the monthly growth of those ETF above, investors are currently taking a defensive and low risk approach by investing in utilities, healthcare and real estate. In an aggressive bull markets, technology and financial sector will do very well which is on the contrary to the above data.\n\nIn conclusion, the market is very likely to correct/downgrade in the coming weeks, once their earnings play are over as I can\u2019t see any positive catalysts coming up. \n\nMY PLAY: SPY Strangle \n\nI doubt the market will breakout higher, I just want to protect my downside. \n\nSPY ($ 442.52 current)STRANGLE: 20th Aug (2 x $ 437 PUT@1.85) and 1 x $447 CALL@1.27) \n\nNewbie here, please comment and enlighten me.", "id": "p07kvh", "created_utc": 1628394437.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/Psychological-Sky893, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09723402559757233}, {"body": "This is way too conservative for WSB.

So why would you buy this low beta snooze fest? High Dividends, good value, rising revenue, and more.\n\nSo first we start with basic reasons why you should buy into the health sector, demand literally never goes away. You could take out a mortgage to buy a play on oil futures, but you'd be at the mercy of some fat Saudi Arabian man halfway across the world, but with health, it's a market that has constant and steady demand with no catalysts that can diminish it in any significant way. You might also consider it because of the potential of the delta variant, and how health stocks may be one of the few sectors resistant to it.\n\nNow onto the company itself, if you've seen pharmaceutical ads in any capacity you are probably familiar with [Eliquis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apixaban), [Revlimid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenalidomide), and [Opdivo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nivolumab), all of which generate over $1 billion dollars in revenue for BMY. Along with 41 other brands of drugs it produces,  BMY has large enough diversity to hedge itself through the amount and variety of products it offers.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c9jqxii797g71.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=c36b7ebc1da95bdd43058d7c9bfbf47dc607df02\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ab6rai797g71.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cd3f6113a6bbafdb388d38cc99ad4e7018163a7\n\nBMY is also incredibly financially strong, since even though it has a debt to equity percentage of 125% (brought on by financing of its acquisition of cancer and immunology drug maker Celgene), it has a current ratio of 1.54, a quick ratio of 1.21, and an outstanding covered ratio of 6.13.\n\n\ud83d\udcf7\n\nR&D is an important metric to consider when buying pharma stocks and BMY is in the the top 10 of spenders when it comes to percentage of revenue allocated. In order to perpetuate growth, companies need to consistently pump cash into research new drugs, which obviously comes with risk of failure. This puts BMY in a category of pharma stocks that are financially stable enough to warrant a buy on that merit, while also having robust spending in their R&D department to facilitate growth. This spending continues to grow, this being demonstrated by the near 40% increase in R&D spending within the last year by BMY. Forecasts predict the company will grow by around 7% a year for the next 3-4 years and forward EPS growth expected to reach close to 20%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzlqbci797g71.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c763ac1c26001e0f8ed8aceac32e1ab95160fcc\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pvtxebi797g71.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=90666ca6f43a987500091cdcb8f9fc6a2e783d1b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lzzp2ji797g71.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=83bf84d67cdb6e69c93c599725711c6edd523a4a\n\n>\"Bristol Myers' Opdivo -- a cancer medicine -- and anticoagulant Eliquis (the rights of which Bristol Myers shares with Pfizer) will both be among the **top five best-selling drugs in the world by 2026,** according to the research company Evaluate Pharma\"  [Source](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/2-dirt-cheap-dividend-stocks-you-can-buy-right-now-2021-07-22)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile you may not buy for the dividend, it will definitely make you want to stay. With a 2.88% yield and growth rate of 9% over the past year, it is a nice bonus to an already amazing stock.\n\nNow lets talk value, BMY has a current P/E Ration of 10.08 (9.09 FWD) compared to the industry average of 24.01 (23.47 FWD). Already with head start,  BMY has an EV/EBIDTA of 9.75 (7.48 FWD) compared to the industry average 20.29 (16.36 FWD). I could go on, but you get the main idea that in all value metrics BMY is beating the industry (and market). With the recent acquisition of Celgene undoubtedly adding more value, it's undeniably undervalued.\n\nUpside for BMY is crazy, to bring it to the industry average P/E ratio would bring the price per share to around $179 at current EPS estimates ($7.49), an over 250% increase. While this may be wildly optimistic, even an increase to a P/E ratio of 15 would bring the price to around $112.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nBristol Myers:Squibb is a great, financially stable pharma company with good growth opportunity, tons of value, and dividend growth. The overall consensus from analysts is buy for a reason. BMY is a great way to hedge your portfolio from any volatility in the market (Beta of 0.59) while still getting more gains than any other comparable hedge.\n\nPosition: 15 Shares @ $67.76 (I'm broke so this is 34% of my portfolio)\n\n>Chart and table sources can all be found under Annual/Quarterly Reports or 10-k at [https://www.bms.com/investors/financial-reporting/annual-reports.html](https://www.bms.com/investors/financial-reporting/annual-reports.html) and [https://www.bms.com/investors.html](https://www.bms.com/investors.html)\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "p0n45b", "created_utc": 1628457167.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|4 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12298125773668289}, {"body": "I love their personality tests.
