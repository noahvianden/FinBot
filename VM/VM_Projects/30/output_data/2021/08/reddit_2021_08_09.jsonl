{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, August 9, 2021", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 9, 2021**\n\nStocks finished mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) both pulling back from all-time highs last week, pressured by a broad decline in crude energy stocks. The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose modestly. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.55%.  Like I have been saying the last few weeks, I expect the market to be quite choppy moving forward, as market participants continue to balance record-breaking corporate earnings and the expectation for economic expansion with rising concerns surrounding the coronavirus Delta variant and inflation. \n\nOil prices fell over 2% to a three week low, extending recent losses in the sector as concerns that pandemic-era restrictions may be reinstated across Asia, especially China, which would reduce demand. In the face of rising cases, the world\u2019s second largest economy has extended its border closure and implemented new travel restrictions between areas of high transmission and imposed widespread testing. China\u2019s National Health Commission said it confirmed 125 new infections as of Sunday - the third straight day it reported 90 cases and above. Of the newly confirmed cases, 71 were locally transmitted, said the health commission. \n\nWhile those numbers are very small, it is important to note that the Chinese government has a so-called \u201czero-COVID\u201d approach, meaning the government is sure to act very aggressively, much more than is feasible in Western countries, to stamp out the virus. Already, this week we've seen airline seat capacity in China plummet 32% compared to the week prior, the most since the early days of the pandemic. In an article circulated throughout state-sponsored media, Former Health Minister Gao Qiang wrote, \u201cIs it feasible to \u2018coexist with the virus\u2019? The author believes that it is definitely not feasible. The \u2018coexistence with the virus\u2019 \\[seen in\\] Britain, the United States and other countries has already brought serious consequences to global efforts to contain the epidemic. We must not repeat the same mistakes.\u201d I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see more and more restrictions implemented across China, despite the relatively low numbers they have so far. \n\nNeil Shearing, Chief Economist at Capital Economics wrote in a note, \u201cVirus numbers are still very low compared to other countries. But the spread of the Delta variant calls into question China\u2019s \u2018zero-COVID\u2019 approach. Whereas most governments are now starting to acknowledge that we are likely to have to live with the coronavirus for the long term, China\u2019s ambition remains to keep it out of the country altogether. Without a shift in approach, this suggests that China will have to continue with occasional local lockdowns and restrictions on movement. This in turn will prevent a full return to pre-pandemic norms of consumer and business behavior, and is likely to mean that restrictions on foreign travel remain in place for some time to come.\"\n\nIn response, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) slashed their growth outlooks for the near-future. For example, Goldman slashed its third-quarter real gross domestic product forecast to 2.3% from 5.8%, but lifted its fourth-quarter growth forecast to 8.5% from 5.8%.\n\nHowever, while the Delta variant does pose a risk to global growth rates, in the US, the economy continues to recover at a remarkable rate. The Labor Department\u2019s July Jobs Report marked an unexpected upswing in employment, with the economy adding 943,000 jobs to the 845,000 expected. The unemployment rate was 5.4%, also better than the 5.7% expected. With the coronavirus Delta variant forcing some parts of the US to reinstate some pandemic-era measures, like indoor mask mandates, market participants were closely waiting for this unemployment report. Like I said yesterday, this Job Report was a bit of a wild card, with estimates fluctuating widely from 330,000 to the high 900,000s. Earlier in the week a report by ADP suggested private payrolls were much weaker than expected, with only 330,000 private payrolls added versus the 700,000 expected. On the other hand, Bloomberg economists estimated a gain of more than 900,000 jobs. Happy to see the report come in so positive, a great sign, that despite headwinds remaining, the labor market continues to recover. \n\nAs of Friday, 89% of the companies in the S&P 500 (SPY) have reported earnings, with 87% of those topping estimates for earnings-per-share, according to data from FacSet. If this proportion holds, it would be the highest percentage of companies beating earnings since at least 2008, when FactSet began to track this data.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Followng Penn\u2019s acquisition of the Score Media last week, DraftKings (DKNG) bought Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) for $1.56 billion\n* Shares of Moderna (MRNA) continued their remarkably strong performance, gapping up more than 17% on the day. Stock up 200% in the last 3 months. \n* At the median, consumers expect inflation to rise by 4.8% over the next year,[ according to the New York Federal Reserve's monthly survey. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-consumers-near-term-inflation-150329998.html)This matched June's reading, which was the highest level in the survey's history.  For the next three years, consumers expect inflation to rise by 3.7%, ticking up slightly from the 3.6% print from June and reaching the fastest pace expected since 2013.\n* Job openings in the US were at a record-high in June, underscoring the way labor shortages and supply-side disruptions are capping the pace of recovery. \n* Car-rental company Hertz announced much stronger than expected corporate earnings this quarter and announced the intentions to re-list. I find this very funny, in my opinion, Hertz is one of the original meme stocks.\n* After a brief period of underperformance, financial stocks have been rallying in the last few days. \n* **\\*\\*Please note that the current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices.\\*\\***\n* Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) target raised by TD Securities from $63 to $70 at Buy.
