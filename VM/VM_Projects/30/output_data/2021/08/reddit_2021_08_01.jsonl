A terminal multiple of 18 does not mean that the company is expected to grow at 18%. It is about the price tag that investors are willing to put on said stock in 2030.

You're right in the sense that a multiple is a price tag that investors are willing to pay. Therefore, a company trading at premium multiples entails that investors are more excited about it. That said, a multiple IS a direct measure of growth - reflecting the average growth of the underlying metric. The multiples for certain industries are much higher than others because investors assume that the underlying growth profile of that particular business/industry is expected to be higher than a company in a mature industry. To your point, multiple compression occurs as growth prospects for said companies diminish (hence why investors may not be as excited about it), but that's totally okay because companies and industries mature over time.
