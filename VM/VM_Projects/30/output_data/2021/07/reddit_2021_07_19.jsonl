{"title": "Picking options for risky earnings plays", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI wanted to share with you my process of choosing which options to trade around earnings. I am mainly on the buy side here, so very risky with time decay and iv playing against you, but the hope is to catch tail events that are outside the market expectation already priced in.\n\nI pick the stocks from the recommendations of my ML model ([this](https://www.reddit.com/r/EarningsWatcher/comments/om71bf/biggest_expected_moves_this_week_after_earnings/) post). This used to be a model trying to predict high movement (more than +/-5%) and I refined it to actually predict when the movement is more than \"what the market expects\". This is usually derived from the break even of the options prices, and that I approximate to be the average of the movements around the last five releases plus 1.95 times std (basically miming a gaussian if you're familiar with that). The model outputs a list of stocks that should outperform this value and so beat the market (update coming soon on this btw). For this week, we have $AAL $HON and $NEE. Let's continue with AAL.\n\nThen I use [earnings-watcher.tech](https://earnings-watcher.tech) (hosted version of my model) to make some projections. The average historic movement of 6% with a distribution of movements (absolute value) that looks like this\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c739xrpza7c71.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3ebc7a122f2a84c4f9d29a299147eda693ecc2c\n\nWe actually like this type of histogram because of the fat tail we see on the right, and that's what we will be betting on. Lets make some projections about the expected movement based on this\n\n|conservative = +/-4%|ideal = +/-10%|wow = +/-20%|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|range = (19.2$, 20.8$)|range = (18$, 22$)|range = (16$, 24$)|\n\nNow, let's look at different options combinations. We are mostly interested in the movement of the stock, with no preference for direction, so we will be choosing strangles. I automated scrapping options prices to get this summary\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0th8ilp0b7c71.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c13748b6c52512f4bd93d8749d85b5905a63fde\n\nWe see that the price per contract decreases a lot as we go further in the money, but so does the break even. Using [optionstrat.com](https://optionstrat.com), we can estimate gains and losses from these plays. We have to account for the severe IV crush that happens after the release, and that will make our options loose most of their value if they're not in the money. The closer to the money the strangle is, the higher your chances of recouping some of what you payed for, but then your gains are also lower in case of a tail event (same for further expirations). We can see this in the next graph\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sfgar6l1b7c71.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=27230ed7485030bcecaa2b79eed5b36a31c27ed7\n\nBased on this, I made this recap of gains/loss estimates\n\n|strangle|price / 1 contract|break even|gains at +/-20% move|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|19p / 20c|70$|\\+/-8%|\\+300%|\n|18p / 22c|25$|\\+/-12%|\\+600%|\n\nMy strategy here is to pick the riskiest play for each of the recommended stocks, and usually one tail event makes enough profits to compensate for the other losses, so I picked the 18p/22c and fingers crossed for at least a +/-11% move. Basically if no tail I lose small, if tail I win big, sort of like a vc investing in start ups.\n\nHope this helps and happy to discuss more!", "id": "oniai1", "created_utc": 1626714229.0, "score": 141, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "I post about earnings trades and more in r/EarningsWatcher, join if you're interested!", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4181780219078064}, {"body": "Let us know how it turns out, good luck!", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "I think that's a jade lizard", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I think a Jade lizard is selling a put and selling a credit call spread.\n\nBasically, selling an iron condor without the long put as protection on the downside, no?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, you're right", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18997114896774292}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5686469078063965}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10694779455661774}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08485927432775497}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2656577229499817}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11383890360593796}, {"body": "Well written.

The shares you buy are voteless Class C shares which can be upgraded to normal one-vote Class A shares on a case by case basis. In other words, Robinhood tells all the corporate raiders to bug off.\n\nThe growth of the company has been huge. Revenue [growing by 309%](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/01/how-robinhoods-explosive-growth-rate-came-to-be/#:~:text=The%20fintech%20unicorn's%20revenue%20grew,a%20gain%20of%20around%20309%25.) between 2019 and July 1st. The amount of hate mail they get, poor reviews, SEC fines, growing competition from other low-commission brokers, and at least one guy indiscriminately assaulting Robinhood employees this past year has not stopped new accounts from coming in. From 7.2 million in March 2020 to 18 million [as of July 1st.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/01/robinhood-has-18-million-accounts-managing-80-billion-after-rapid-one-year-growth-ipo-filing-shows.html) This growth has occurred despite many veteran users leaving the platform.\n\nThe reason for these trends can be found by how the average Robinhood user is:\n\n1. 31 years old.\n\n2. Has an account size of $4,500 (compared to E-Trade's $100,000).\n\n3. Is a buy-and-hold investor (only 2% of accounts are flagged PDT).\n\n4. Has 2 positions.\n\n5. Did not have any investment account before Robinhood.\n\nYou see how Robinhood has become the Walmart of Stock Brokers, making money off economies of scale and the least common denominator. Robinhood's easy to use platform should continue to be millions of young people's first introduction to stocks for many decades.\n\nAnother point is Robinhood is now offering early IPO access. This is where they, as an institutional investor, buy large blocks of IPO starter shares and immediately resell them for a little more to their clients. The benefit of this is normally small orders don't have a chance of getting filled during an IPO.\n\nOne oddity from this is that Robinhood is, AS OF THIS MOMENT, offering their own shares on the app. The funny thing is, the many Robinhood users here can be sure your buy order will be filled during the IPO because their broker is making a huge amount of money selling you shares and if nothing else they can create more shares in order to sell them to you. I don't know for a fact they are planning to do that, though.\n\nRobinhood is making roughly $2.2 billion a year as of right now and is seeking a valuation of $35 billion.

Tesla started like this, but I don't think they actually fall in this category anymore. Most big automakers are in here somewhere, although without much progress. I might put Nvidia in here, at least from a hardware perspective? And then you have companies like GM that are selling ADAS, but are also investing in Cruise\n* What Tesla is doing. I'd say Tesla is pretty unique because they're making and selling Autopilot, which seems like clearly the most advanced ADAS, while also working on a completely different FSD software that's basically generated no revenue (everything they've recognized now is based on the AP \"stack\"). And using data from the first to improve the second. Although I might put MobilEye in this category too because they're selling ADAS to manufacturers and also working on autonomy themselves. I'd suspect that the data from manufacturer fleets doesn't go back to MobilEye though? But at least they get the revenue, which is clearly important.\n\nTesla is also unusual/unique for a couple other reasons:\n\n* They're just installing the hardware, way ahead of when the software is ready.

They're limited in what they can recognize as revenue from an accounting perspective, but at least they can cover some of the hardware costs. I know that this has been a controversial choice on their part, but given how hard full autonomy is/will be, it might be that having people kickstart/preorder FSD will be really important to having enough revenue to invest in the development needed to actually get it done?", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": ">They're just installing the hardware, way ahead of when the software is ready.
