It's been forever since most of you were on the receiving end.  Another fact:  somewhere deep in that smooth brain of yours, no matter how many you've recently handed out behind a Costco dumpster, you still remember your first with a nostalgic fondness never to be found again.\n\nUntil today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[More fun to get than receive, \\(respectfully\\)!](https://preview.redd.it/devaqljz31b71.jpg?width=112&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5b54f4528eeb7fc5ce7b091dec1f88de5d6e5fa)\n\nFor those poor, unfortunate souls who have no idea what I'm talking about, put down your flesh flute, and try to keep up.  You might just learn something to transform your meager, basement-dwelling existence into Alpha  Chad, an individual your special someone can't wait to fellate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Ginger, what in the name of consumer spending are you talking about?\"\n\nA valid question my degenerative compatriots!\n\nIf all this sounds foreign to you, let me ask it another way:  Have you ever heard of Costco?  (\"Of course, Ginger,\" you'll say.)  Have you ever heard of Sam's club?  (\"Duh, Ginger, [Kanye had to show some ID to get inside that place](https://youtu.be/p4NvOKy7GOU?t=103).\")  How right you are!\n\nHowever, in the event you blindly DoorDash your three squares all day every day, each of the aforementioned entities, Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's Wholesale, operate on the same business model.  That is, they each sell memberships to consumers, thereby providing access to \"wholesale\" priced merchandise.  I'm here today to advocate why putting a portion of you hard earned dumpster dollars into $BJ might get you some creamy returns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"OK, Ginger.  I'm interested.  What can you tell me about BJs?\"\n\n\\* ... ignores joke .. \\*  Well, if you haven't already guessed, BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. is a leading warehouse club that operates primarily on the east coast of the United States.  As of May 1, 2021, BJ's operated 221 warehouse clubs and 151 gas stations in 17 states.  The vast majority of the company's sales are food, (people gotta eat), and gas, (people gotta drive).  But they, just like all their competitors, sell just about everything - from consumer staples to consumer discretionary (electronics).\n\nImportantly, on the last earnings call, BJ's [announced](https://investors.bjs.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/BJs-Wholesale-Club-Expands-its-Footprint-with-Plans-to-Open-Six-New-Clubs/default.aspx) plans to expand and open an additional 6 locations by the end of the current fiscal year.  Also, on the call, BJ's enjoyed a 9% increase in membership fees income thanks to its growing shopper base and strong demand for higher-tier membership plans.  The company is growing and expanding and likely will continue to do so in the coming years.\n\nWithout delving too much into the last 10Q fundamentals, the stock sold off in May following earnings beats for the quarter ending March 31, 2021.  BJs received approx. $3.78B in net sales, and $86M in recurring membership fees, for total quarterly revenue of $3.868B.  Comparatively speaking, (Q over Q) that revenue number was UP over the quarter ending March 31, 2020, which I find rather remarkable, since the March 2020 quarter was when BJ's saw the insane surge in demand for stockpiling bulk item supplies in preparation of the coming lockdowns.  (People gotta eat, and people gotta drive.)  Unsurprisingly, the post-earnings selloff gap has been filled, which should be expected from a company that beats earnings and generates positive cash flow.\n\nIn short, things are trending in the right direction.  But, the next few quarters could have EPS misses as the company spends money on expansion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"OK, Ginger, even when I have a dictionary and investopedia open, I still can't read more than 1 page of a 10Q.  Can you, like, show me a pretty picture or something?\"\n\nHappy to.  Here's two:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Daily Chart, courtesy of FinViz.](https://preview.redd.it/44ju0jdm31b71.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51c1bd8f5d28bc4f042db2a10b840e442541e98b)\n\n[Custom 1 Year Daily. $48.85 resistance.  $45.85 most recent support.](https://preview.redd.it/igoo22q700b71.jpg?width=1366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7007af7c26f0de0b05a605fd74e06ccdc44361d8)\n\nTechnically, BJ's is coming to a head.  The stock is trading in a narrowing & ascending channel, and is approaching an ATH set in late January.  Even better, is the ascending triangle, for which the top resistance has formed - at or about $48.75 - and four consecutive lower lows have been bought up.  Daily avg. vol. has been decreasing, which, admittedly, is not what I want to see, but a breakout above the Jan. 2021 ATH could spark a significant volume inflow and push price action convincingly into the $50s.\n\nOn top of the heady looking chart, is a 9.3% short interest on a 135M common share float.  Not the highest short percentage, but with an average daily volume of approx. 1.35M shares, it would take about 9 days at current volume for shorts to cover.  I'm not advancing that this is major squeeze candidate, but, taken in consideration with the technical setup, a big ole fat 10% - 15% green daily candle could be in the very near future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"But Ginger, why should I buy this, over Sam's Club, $COST, $WMT or $TGT?\n\nWell, dummy, Sam's Club isn't publicly traded.  $COST has a $180B Market cap and trades at 10x $BJ's current share price with a 35x forward PE.  $TGT has a $122B market cap and trades at $250/share with a 20x forward PE.  $WMT has a $390B market cap and trades at $140/share with a 22x forward PE.\n\n$BJ has a $6.5B market cap and trades at $48/share with a 16x forward PE.  If anything, BJ provides a lower cost of entry to the consumer staple and discretionary sectors, with far more upside potential given its market cap in relation to its peers and current forward earnings ratio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Ginger, you are wise, and sage like.  What should I buy to make sure I get the gawk gawk DHT 3000???\"\n\nWell dummies, just like u/fuzzyblankeet, I don't give advice for free.  Although I haven't finished building my BJ position, right now I'm long January 2022 $50 calls.  Based on the chart, I'll add shares below $47.00 with a stop at about $45.00 (which would be slightly more than 2% below the last supportive close of $46.08).  Today's CPI numbers didn't do much to tank the sector, or this particular ticker, (at publication, down .75%, so I'm not sure how many opportunities there will be to buy a dip at that level given the supporting trend lines.\n\nOn average, it's taken 11 trading days to get back to the top or resistance line, and the longest trend upwards lasted 19 days before finding resistance.\n\nOn average, it's takes about 8 trading days for BJs to pull back to the bottom of the channel/support from the top or the resistance point.  The longest trend down lasted 15 days before finding support.\n\nAugust $50 calls are risky today, since the stock is about 3.5% above the current support, and could be starting a trend down back towards resistance.  If you are looking for instant gratification from your BJ position, August $50 monthlies might be a buy around July 22 regardless of price, or if BJs pulls back to $46-$47 any time before then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Damn, Ginger, what's the risk?\"\n\nWe'll, you'll lose your money.\n\nI'd consider the technical setup to be lost after two or three consecutive closes below $45.00.  If run ups to the top of the resistance don't break through convincingly on some increased volume, be wary of a triple top.  I'm not an expert with identifying Elliott Waves, but it might be possible we're already trending down a Corrective Wave C, but corrective waves are notoriously difficult to identify.  (positively, though, my brokerage identified Wave 2 closing on June 18.  If anyone knows more about this, and wants to kick the tires, I'd love to hear your analysis.)\n\nFundamentally, BJ does have some stiff competition.  COST, WMT, & TGT are significant competitors.  Each have nationwide recognition.  The ability for BJs to earn market share won't be easy, but it certainly can be done as evidenced by the company's ability to open 6 new stores this fiscal year.  Insiders have been selling of late:  3 sales the week of and after earnings.  Next earnings are on Aug 18.\n\nThat's about the most obvious hits I can dig up at the moment.\n\nta ta for now.", "id": "ojmga2", "created_utc": 1626203050.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|172|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nuu3fz/forget_britney_fannie_mae_and_freddie_mac_is_the/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3793257772922516}, {"body": "Monica Lewinski was just appointed to the Board of Directors", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "god dammit. i just googled \"Monica Lewinski BJ's\" to see if this was accurate.\n\ni am not a smart man.", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5130279660224915}, {"body": "blue dress?", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0758725106716156}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1932641714811325}, {"body": "Sam's Club\u00a0is a subsidiary of\u00a0Walmart, which trades under the ticker WMT on the New York Stock Exchange, gave you an extra brain wrinkle for good measure.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Did not know that.

It's been forever since most of you were on the receiving end.  Another fact:  somewhere deep in that smooth brain of yours, no matter how many you've recently handed out behind a Costco dumpster, you still remember your first with a nostalgic fondness never to be found again.\n\nUntil today.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[More fun to get than receive, \\(respectfully\\)!](https://preview.redd.it/devaqljz31b71.jpg?width=112&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5b54f4528eeb7fc5ce7b091dec1f88de5d6e5fa)\n\nFor those poor, unfortunate souls who have no idea what I'm talking about, put down your flesh flute, and try to keep up.  You might just learn something to transform your meager, basement-dwelling existence into Alpha  Chad, an individual your special someone can't wait to fellate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Ginger, what in the name of consumer spending are you talking about?\"\n\nA valid question my degenerative compatriots!\n\nIf all this sounds foreign to you, let me ask it another way:  Have you ever heard of Costco?  (\"Of course, Ginger,\" you'll say.)  Have you ever heard of Sam's club?  (\"Duh, Ginger, [Kanye had to show some ID to get inside that place](https://youtu.be/p4NvOKy7GOU?t=103).\")  How right you are!\n\nHowever, in the event you blindly DoorDash your three squares all day every day, each of the aforementioned entities, Costco, Sam's Club, and BJ's Wholesale, operate on the same business model.  That is, they each sell memberships to consumers, thereby providing access to \"wholesale\" priced merchandise.  I'm here today to advocate why putting a portion of you hard earned dumpster dollars into $BJ might get you some creamy returns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"OK, Ginger.  I'm interested.  What can you tell me about BJs?\"\n\n\\* ... ignores joke .. \\*  Well, if you haven't already guessed, BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club Holdings, Inc. is a leading warehouse club that operates primarily on the east coast of the United States.  As of May 1, 2021, BJ's operated 221 warehouse clubs and 151 gas stations in 17 states.  The vast majority of the company's sales are food, (people gotta eat), and gas, (people gotta drive).  But they, just like all their competitors, sell just about everything - from consumer staples to consumer discretionary (electronics).\n\nImportantly, on the last earnings call, BJ's [announced](https://investors.bjs.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/BJs-Wholesale-Club-Expands-its-Footprint-with-Plans-to-Open-Six-New-Clubs/default.aspx) plans to expand and open an additional 6 locations by the end of the current fiscal year.  Also, on the call, BJ's enjoyed a 9% increase in membership fees income thanks to its growing shopper base and strong demand for higher-tier membership plans.  The company is growing and expanding and likely will continue to do so in the coming years.\n\nWithout delving too much into the last 10Q fundamentals, the stock sold off in May following earnings beats for the quarter ending March 31, 2021.  BJs received approx. $3.78B in net sales, and $86M in recurring membership fees, for total quarterly revenue of $3.868B.  Comparatively speaking, (Q over Q) that revenue number was UP over the quarter ending March 31, 2020, which I find rather remarkable, since the March 2020 quarter was when BJ's saw the insane surge in demand for stockpiling bulk item supplies in preparation of the coming lockdowns.  (People gotta eat, and people gotta drive.)  Unsurprisingly, the post-earnings selloff gap has been filled, which should be expected from a company that beats earnings and generates positive cash flow.\n\nIn short, things are trending in the right direction.  But, the next few quarters could have EPS misses as the company spends money on expansion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"OK, Ginger, even when I have a dictionary and investopedia open, I still can't read more than 1 page of a 10Q.  Can you, like, show me a pretty picture or something?\"\n\nHappy to.  Here's two:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Daily Chart, courtesy of FinViz.](https://preview.redd.it/44ju0jdm31b71.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51c1bd8f5d28bc4f042db2a10b840e442541e98b)\n\n[Custom 1 Year Daily. $48.85 resistance.  $45.85 most recent support.](https://preview.redd.it/igoo22q700b71.jpg?width=1366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7007af7c26f0de0b05a605fd74e06ccdc44361d8)\n\nTechnically, BJ's is coming to a head.  The stock is trading in a narrowing & ascending channel, and is approaching an ATH set in late January.  Even better, is the ascending triangle, for which the top resistance has formed - at or about $48.75 - and four consecutive lower lows have been bought up.  Daily avg. vol. has been decreasing, which, admittedly, is not what I want to see, but a breakout above the Jan. 2021 ATH could spark a significant volume inflow and push price action convincingly into the $50s.\n\nOn top of the heady looking chart, is a 9.3% short interest on a 135M common share float.  Not the highest short percentage, but with an average daily volume of approx. 1.35M shares, it would take about 9 days at current volume for shorts to cover.  I'm not advancing that this is major squeeze candidate, but, taken in consideration with the technical setup, a big ole fat 10% - 15% green daily candle could be in the very near future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"But Ginger, why should I buy this, over Sam's Club, $COST, $WMT or $TGT?\n\nWell, dummy, Sam's Club isn't publicly traded.  $COST has a $180B Market cap and trades at 10x $BJ's current share price with a 35x forward PE.  $TGT has a $122B market cap and trades at $250/share with a 20x forward PE.  $WMT has a $390B market cap and trades at $140/share with a 22x forward PE.\n\n$BJ has a $6.5B market cap and trades at $48/share with a 16x forward PE.  If anything, BJ provides a lower cost of entry to the consumer staple and discretionary sectors, with far more upside potential given its market cap in relation to its peers and current forward earnings ratio.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Ginger, you are wise, and sage like.  What should I buy to make sure I get the gawk gawk DHT 3000???\"\n\nWell dummies, just like u/fuzzyblankeet, I don't give advice for free.  Although I haven't finished building my BJ position, right now I'm long January 2022 $50 calls.  Based on the chart, I'll add shares below $47.00 with a stop at about $45.00 (which would be slightly more than 2% below the last supportive close of $46.08).  Today's CPI numbers didn't do much to tank the sector, or this particular ticker, (at publication, down .75%, so I'm not sure how many opportunities there will be to buy a dip at that level given the supporting trend lines.\n\nOn average, it's taken 11 trading days to get back to the top or resistance line, and the longest trend upwards lasted 19 days before finding resistance.\n\nOn average, it's takes about 8 trading days for BJs to pull back to the bottom of the channel/support from the top or the resistance point.  The longest trend down lasted 15 days before finding support.\n\nAugust $50 calls are risky today, since the stock is about 3.5% above the current support, and could be starting a trend down back towards resistance.  If you are looking for instant gratification from your BJ position, August $50 monthlies might be a buy around July 22 regardless of price, or if BJs pulls back to $46-$47 any time before then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Damn, Ginger, what's the risk?\"\n\nWe'll, you'll lose your money.\n\nI'd consider the technical setup to be lost after two or three consecutive closes below $45.00.  If run ups to the top of the resistance don't break through convincingly on some increased volume, be wary of a triple top.  I'm not an expert with identifying Elliott Waves, but it might be possible we're already trending down a Corrective Wave C, but corrective waves are notoriously difficult to identify.  (positively, though, my brokerage identified Wave 2 closing on June 18.  If anyone knows more about this, and wants to kick the tires, I'd love to hear your analysis.)\n\nFundamentally, BJ does have some stiff competition.  COST, WMT, & TGT are significant competitors.  Each have nationwide recognition.  The ability for BJs to earn market share won't be easy, but it certainly can be done as evidenced by the company's ability to open 6 new stores this fiscal year.  Insiders have been selling of late:  3 sales the week of and after earnings.  Next earnings are on Aug 18.\n\nThat's about the most obvious hits I can dig up at the moment.\n\nta ta for now.", "id": "ojmga2", "created_utc": 1626203050.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|172|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nuu3fz/forget_britney_fannie_mae_and_freddie_mac_is_the/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3793257772922516}, {"body": "Monica Lewinski was just appointed to the Board of Directors", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "god dammit. i just googled \"Monica Lewinski BJ's\" to see if this was accurate.\n\ni am not a smart man.", "score": 12, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5130279660224915}, {"body": "blue dress?", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0758725106716156}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1932641714811325}, {"body": "Sam's Club\u00a0is a subsidiary of\u00a0Walmart, which trades under the ticker WMT on the New York Stock Exchange, gave you an extra brain wrinkle for good measure.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Did not know that.
