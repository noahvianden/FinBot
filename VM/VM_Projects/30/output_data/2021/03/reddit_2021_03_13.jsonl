{"title": "Simplying Law DD series - NSCC rule 18 and GME", "selftext": "Alright my first DD hit well, but I've got the impression all those after it are essentially not plain enough. I'm going to try and take a different approach and simplify as much as possible.\n\nNot financial or legal advice, any assumptions drawn are your own, hell I might and probably am wrong on things (have been before) and if I am, do your part - please tell me and I'll update.\n\nThis will be the first in a series and we'll start with a simplified DD on Rule 18 of the NSCC rules, as this forms part of the 'disorderly market' rule spotted where people are afraid the NSCC and friends will just sit back and let the 'participants' mess with trying to prevent the MOASS, ironically, for fear of creating a disorderly market their members already made.\n\nI mean we know they've already done that with GME as other excellent DD shows, but let's get into it.\n\nRule 18. This rule applies **only** when the NSCC declines / ceases to act for a 'participant'. OK great but what does that mean and what causes this?\n\nThe rule states the NSCC will cease to act should a participant become a Defaulting Member, or undergo a Defaulting Event. i.e. the NSCC determines that member either can't settle a trade based on their funds or made a really stupid decision or multiple decisions on a trade or actions involved in it. This means guess what? We block your access in the market and control your portfolio until it's resolved using this rule.\n\nThe list of who this affects is looong. Pretty much anyone with a relationship to the NSCC. For ease for us apes, this affects entities such as Citadel (member). Anyone can apply as any kind of member though, provided they are FATCA certified and have a Cybersecurity confirmation and get approved (i.e. many more than you might think).\n\nSide note: those we suspect are responsible for GME are still members. They might have gone through a Defaulting Event (January?), but as they aren't insolvent and are active in the market, it's safe to assume these rules aren't in play. Even if they get kicked out, this isn't FUD relating to payment if the market goes crazy, more on this later.\n\nOnto the rule. So the NSCC thinks you fucked up or you did, or both and you're either a dreaded Default Member / went through a Defaulting Event. What now? \n\nUnless the NSCC board says otherwise, on their notice being delivered, any CNS trade, Balance Order trade, Special Trade or Foreign trade, Long or Short position(s) for an OW Obligation that was entered for a CNS Accounting Operation, any cash relating to an OW adjustment and uncompleted cash ACATS transaction are the fuck up's responsibility.\n\n*Special mention: fuck Special Trades. Literally defined as security trades between members only and it's allowed. Ripe for manipulation if you ask me.*\n\nI know what you're thinking. What does any of that mean?\n\nThe thing about legal documents, they'll make up a bunch of definitions on the first page, which then refer you to many different pages to explain a definition. Then they expect you know what they're talking about 100 pages later to bore your ass into not looking it up.\n\nFortunately, I have nothing better to do. Or maybe I do, but I'm a retard. For ape understanding, this is basically saying anything you're on the hook for the moment our letter of bye bye is delivered, you're responsible for.\n\nOh no, does this mean they won't pay for the GME squeeze? **Nope.**\n\nPut simply, this is the NSCC's way of clawing back as much money from that member's fuck up as possible before paying the remainder of what they can't liquidate from them first. \n\nIt also states any net loss will be debited to the member, meaning they pay it first in accordance with their rules and get whatever they can when they're liquidated. Not only that, any sums due to the stupid member from other members will also be used to close them out.\n\n*This makes the SLD filing that much more pronounced in my view, as they think even this risk isn't enough to stop members making stupid decisions.*\n\nFor instance, all the following rules gives the NSCC the right to take control of that member's entire NSCC and friends holdings to sort things out. \n\nThe rule also states they will focus on settlement, not profit or loss. The **only** reason they will not just fire sell / buy is if they think it's related to fraud; or would cause a disorderly market to genuine market participants. \n\nWhat I think they mean by this is imagine Blackrock took out an uncharacteristic fat risky short position which dived, and then suddenly the NSCC liquidated their GME position on the bid and the stock tanked before the squeeze and allowed shorters to cover at low prices due to the low volume. \n\nYou'd be furious as you were affected by some third parties stupid decision. That's why they allow it at their **discretion** instead. They'll probably buy the shorts or sell the longs at some point, but they also don't want to cause a crash / surge in any stock.\n\nLet's face it, at this stage a risky, double, tripled etc down short position in GME would likely cause the NSCC to buy at any price, as they'd see what's coming and was only ever being delayed by their members if they hold this position, as they continue to eat billions in interest. \n\nPulling the band aid off quickly may be the better approach if you don't face the risk of becoming insolvent and the loss is theoretically infinite.\n\nThe rule therefore has no impact on the NSCC stepping in and causing / preventing the squeeze for GME. If anything, if a member triggers this rule I'd argue it helps it.\n\nTLDT: this rule is like the NSCC's version of an intervention for that loved one you know is a gambling addict. You take away their cards and cash, sell their damn car if you need to and collect owed money from their 'friends', and pay off the rest yourself until you get them paid off. Then, you never let them into the casino again.\n\nEdit: not even removing the TLDT mistake or the misspelling of simplifying as it shows I belong here", "id": "m3vhmg", "created_utc": 1615596543.0, "score": 135, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for siphoning through all of it.

{"title": "Simplying Law DD series - NSCC rule 18 and GME", "selftext": "Alright my first DD hit well, but I've got the impression all those after it are essentially not plain enough. I'm going to try and take a different approach and simplify as much as possible.\n\nNot financial or legal advice, any assumptions drawn are your own, hell I might and probably am wrong on things (have been before) and if I am, do your part - please tell me and I'll update.\n\nThis will be the first in a series and we'll start with a simplified DD on Rule 18 of the NSCC rules, as this forms part of the 'disorderly market' rule spotted where people are afraid the NSCC and friends will just sit back and let the 'participants' mess with trying to prevent the MOASS, ironically, for fear of creating a disorderly market their members already made.\n\nI mean we know they've already done that with GME as other excellent DD shows, but let's get into it.\n\nRule 18. This rule applies **only** when the NSCC declines / ceases to act for a 'participant'. OK great but what does that mean and what causes this?\n\nThe rule states the NSCC will cease to act should a participant become a Defaulting Member, or undergo a Defaulting Event. i.e. the NSCC determines that member either can't settle a trade based on their funds or made a really stupid decision or multiple decisions on a trade or actions involved in it. This means guess what? We block your access in the market and control your portfolio until it's resolved using this rule.\n\nThe list of who this affects is looong. Pretty much anyone with a relationship to the NSCC. For ease for us apes, this affects entities such as Citadel (member). Anyone can apply as any kind of member though, provided they are FATCA certified and have a Cybersecurity confirmation and get approved (i.e. many more than you might think).\n\nSide note: those we suspect are responsible for GME are still members. They might have gone through a Defaulting Event (January?), but as they aren't insolvent and are active in the market, it's safe to assume these rules aren't in play. Even if they get kicked out, this isn't FUD relating to payment if the market goes crazy, more on this later.\n\nOnto the rule. So the NSCC thinks you fucked up or you did, or both and you're either a dreaded Default Member / went through a Defaulting Event. What now? \n\nUnless the NSCC board says otherwise, on their notice being delivered, any CNS trade, Balance Order trade, Special Trade or Foreign trade, Long or Short position(s) for an OW Obligation that was entered for a CNS Accounting Operation, any cash relating to an OW adjustment and uncompleted cash ACATS transaction are the fuck up's responsibility.\n\n*Special mention: fuck Special Trades. Literally defined as security trades between members only and it's allowed. Ripe for manipulation if you ask me.*\n\nI know what you're thinking. What does any of that mean?\n\nThe thing about legal documents, they'll make up a bunch of definitions on the first page, which then refer you to many different pages to explain a definition. Then they expect you know what they're talking about 100 pages later to bore your ass into not looking it up.\n\nFortunately, I have nothing better to do. Or maybe I do, but I'm a retard. For ape understanding, this is basically saying anything you're on the hook for the moment our letter of bye bye is delivered, you're responsible for.\n\nOh no, does this mean they won't pay for the GME squeeze? **Nope.**\n\nPut simply, this is the NSCC's way of clawing back as much money from that member's fuck up as possible before paying the remainder of what they can't liquidate from them first. \n\nIt also states any net loss will be debited to the member, meaning they pay it first in accordance with their rules and get whatever they can when they're liquidated. Not only that, any sums due to the stupid member from other members will also be used to close them out.\n\n*This makes the SLD filing that much more pronounced in my view, as they think even this risk isn't enough to stop members making stupid decisions.*\n\nFor instance, all the following rules gives the NSCC the right to take control of that member's entire NSCC and friends holdings to sort things out. \n\nThe rule also states they will focus on settlement, not profit or loss. The **only** reason they will not just fire sell / buy is if they think it's related to fraud; or would cause a disorderly market to genuine market participants. \n\nWhat I think they mean by this is imagine Blackrock took out an uncharacteristic fat risky short position which dived, and then suddenly the NSCC liquidated their GME position on the bid and the stock tanked before the squeeze and allowed shorters to cover at low prices due to the low volume. \n\nYou'd be furious as you were affected by some third parties stupid decision. That's why they allow it at their **discretion** instead. They'll probably buy the shorts or sell the longs at some point, but they also don't want to cause a crash / surge in any stock.\n\nLet's face it, at this stage a risky, double, tripled etc down short position in GME would likely cause the NSCC to buy at any price, as they'd see what's coming and was only ever being delayed by their members if they hold this position, as they continue to eat billions in interest. \n\nPulling the band aid off quickly may be the better approach if you don't face the risk of becoming insolvent and the loss is theoretically infinite.\n\nThe rule therefore has no impact on the NSCC stepping in and causing / preventing the squeeze for GME. If anything, if a member triggers this rule I'd argue it helps it.\n\nTLDT: this rule is like the NSCC's version of an intervention for that loved one you know is a gambling addict. You take away their cards and cash, sell their damn car if you need to and collect owed money from their 'friends', and pay off the rest yourself until you get them paid off. Then, you never let them into the casino again.\n\nEdit: not even removing the TLDT mistake or the misspelling of simplifying as it shows I belong here", "id": "m3vhmg", "created_utc": 1615596543.0, "score": 135, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for siphoning through all of it.
