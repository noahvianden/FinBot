I don\u2019t get this concept.\n\nThey are kind of related but not really.  They are more separate than linked.\n\nLet's start with inflation.  Inflation generally occurs in large amounts when there is a prolonged period of high velocity money printing.\n\nA relatively recent example of this is pre-WWII Germany.  In this period, the German government employed a large number of its citizens to print money.  The recounts of the paper mills and printing presses are staggering.  In those days, they had to physically print the bills.  So, they did this for months and months and months and months.  Ultimately, it caused rampant inflation and economic collapse.\n\nSo, there is fear from some US investors that the combination of the 3 stimulus packages, the US government's history of running a deficit, and the federal reserve's current monetary policy will cause inflation.\n\nThis is more or less the inflation argument.  I wouldn't panic or get super worried over it.  The US government has economic tools to create and to reduce inflation.  If it starts to get too high, they can reign it in.\n\nNext, the US Treasury bond interest rates are set by the US Treasury.  At its core, it is that simple.  Any given week, the bankers get together and decide how many bonds they want to sell and at what rate.  Then, they go out and try to sell them.  The results of the sale determine what happens going into the next week when they try to sell more.  If no one bought last week's set of bonds, they likely need to raise the interest rates to make them more attractive to buyers for the following week.\n\nNow, the logical follow-up question, \"Why are people not buying them?\", is a very hard question to answer and is beyond what I know and can explain on the internet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The rates don\u2019t seem that high compared to what they were 10/20/30 years ago\n\nThis is correct.  The US government has been pushing interest rates down since about the 1980s to stimulate the economy.  This is worrisome to certain US investors but, again, is beyond my understanding and ability explain.\n\nAnd finally, stock prices.\n\nThere is a math equation analysts use to predict the future value of stock prices.  So, think like: \"x + y + z + w = stock price in the future\"\n\nOne of those variables is the interest rate.  When the interest rate goes up, the stock price the math equation produces gets smaller.  So, large institutions and investors start selling as the interest rate climbs.", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "This guy gave you the perfect answer but I\u2019ll add a caveat.

In a not so good economy this money is mostly invested in stocks and bonds instead. \n\nAt that point you have significantly less demand for both stocks and bonds.

The ban, relayed to residents of military housing this week, was triggered by concerns that the world\u2019s biggest maker of electric vehicles is collecting sensitive data via the cars\u2019 in-built cameras in a way the Chinese government can\u2019t see or control, one of the people said.\n\nImages of what was purported to be a notice about the ban were also circulating on Chinese social media. Multi-direction cameras and ultrasonic sensors in Tesla cars may \u201cexpose locations\u201d and the vehicles are being barred from military residences to ensure the safety of confidential military information, the notice said.\n\nA representative for Tesla in China declined to comment on the military\u2019s move. China\u2019s Defense Ministry didn\u2019t immediately respond to a fax sent after after business hours.\n\nTesla, like many other automakers including General Motors Co., uses several small cameras, mainly located on the outside of the vehicle, to help guide parking, autopilot and self-driving functions. Most Tesla models also have an interior camera mounted above the rear view mirror that can be used to detect whether a driver is looking at the road, looking down at their lap, wearing sunglasses, or looking at something else entirely.\n\nInternal Camera\n\nThe California-based company -- which produces Model 3s and Model Y SUV crossovers at a Gigafactory near Shanghai -- hasn\u2019t shied away from that fact, with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeting in April 2019 that the internal camera is there \u201cfor when we start competing with Uber/Lyft and people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn case someone messes up your car, you can check the video,\u201d Musk explained.\n\nSince then, Tesla has started using cars\u2019 internal cameras to monitor what it calls FSD (full self driving) beta testers, or Tesla owners who have volunteered to test out the company\u2019s driver-assist capabilities.\n\nEarlier this month, Musk tweeted that the company\u2019s FSD beta trial had been expanded to around 2,000 owners but Tesla had also \u201crevoked beta where drivers did not pay sufficient attention to the road.\u201d Musk said the next significant release of FSD beta would be in April.\n\nConcern over this program contributed to the ban by the military, one of the people said.\n\nNone of the in-car cameras in Teslas sold in China are turned on or part of the FSD beta trial, the Tesla representative said.

I don\u2019t get this concept.\n\nThey are kind of related but not really.  They are more separate than linked.\n\nLet's start with inflation.  Inflation generally occurs in large amounts when there is a prolonged period of high velocity money printing.\n\nA relatively recent example of this is pre-WWII Germany.  In this period, the German government employed a large number of its citizens to print money.  The recounts of the paper mills and printing presses are staggering.  In those days, they had to physically print the bills.  So, they did this for months and months and months and months.  Ultimately, it caused rampant inflation and economic collapse.\n\nSo, there is fear from some US investors that the combination of the 3 stimulus packages, the US government's history of running a deficit, and the federal reserve's current monetary policy will cause inflation.\n\nThis is more or less the inflation argument.  I wouldn't panic or get super worried over it.  The US government has economic tools to create and to reduce inflation.  If it starts to get too high, they can reign it in.\n\nNext, the US Treasury bond interest rates are set by the US Treasury.  At its core, it is that simple.  Any given week, the bankers get together and decide how many bonds they want to sell and at what rate.  Then, they go out and try to sell them.  The results of the sale determine what happens going into the next week when they try to sell more.  If no one bought last week's set of bonds, they likely need to raise the interest rates to make them more attractive to buyers for the following week.\n\nNow, the logical follow-up question, \"Why are people not buying them?\", is a very hard question to answer and is beyond what I know and can explain on the internet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The rates don\u2019t seem that high compared to what they were 10/20/30 years ago\n\nThis is correct.  The US government has been pushing interest rates down since about the 1980s to stimulate the economy.  This is worrisome to certain US investors but, again, is beyond my understanding and ability explain.\n\nAnd finally, stock prices.\n\nThere is a math equation analysts use to predict the future value of stock prices.  So, think like: \"x + y + z + w = stock price in the future\"\n\nOne of those variables is the interest rate.  When the interest rate goes up, the stock price the math equation produces gets smaller.  So, large institutions and investors start selling as the interest rate climbs.", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "This guy gave you the perfect answer but I\u2019ll add a caveat.

The ban, relayed to residents of military housing this week, was triggered by concerns that the world\u2019s biggest maker of electric vehicles is collecting sensitive data via the cars\u2019 in-built cameras in a way the Chinese government can\u2019t see or control, one of the people said.\n\nImages of what was purported to be a notice about the ban were also circulating on Chinese social media. Multi-direction cameras and ultrasonic sensors in Tesla cars may \u201cexpose locations\u201d and the vehicles are being barred from military residences to ensure the safety of confidential military information, the notice said.\n\nA representative for Tesla in China declined to comment on the military\u2019s move. China\u2019s Defense Ministry didn\u2019t immediately respond to a fax sent after after business hours.\n\nTesla, like many other automakers including General Motors Co., uses several small cameras, mainly located on the outside of the vehicle, to help guide parking, autopilot and self-driving functions. Most Tesla models also have an interior camera mounted above the rear view mirror that can be used to detect whether a driver is looking at the road, looking down at their lap, wearing sunglasses, or looking at something else entirely.\n\nInternal Camera\n\nThe California-based company -- which produces Model 3s and Model Y SUV crossovers at a Gigafactory near Shanghai -- hasn\u2019t shied away from that fact, with Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeting in April 2019 that the internal camera is there \u201cfor when we start competing with Uber/Lyft and people allow their car to earn money for them as part of the Tesla shared autonomy fleet.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn case someone messes up your car, you can check the video,\u201d Musk explained.\n\nSince then, Tesla has started using cars\u2019 internal cameras to monitor what it calls FSD (full self driving) beta testers, or Tesla owners who have volunteered to test out the company\u2019s driver-assist capabilities.\n\nEarlier this month, Musk tweeted that the company\u2019s FSD beta trial had been expanded to around 2,000 owners but Tesla had also \u201crevoked beta where drivers did not pay sufficient attention to the road.\u201d Musk said the next significant release of FSD beta would be in April.\n\nConcern over this program contributed to the ban by the military, one of the people said.\n\nNone of the in-car cameras in Teslas sold in China are turned on or part of the FSD beta trial, the Tesla representative said. Tesla\u2019s privacy policies comply with national laws and local regulations in China, they said.\n\nChina Apology\n\nChina, the world\u2019s biggest market for EVs, is key to Musk\u2019s global growth ambitions.
