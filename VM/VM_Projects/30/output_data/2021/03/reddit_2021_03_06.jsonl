{"title": "Market Theory for back half of the year", "selftext": "Hey folks, for those that didn\u2019t read the first post a couple of days ago \n\n[first theory ](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lwyzf7/theory_for_market_outlook_in_back_half_of_2021/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\n\nI had another prediction in r/stocks a little over a week ago that a market correction was still to continue.\n\nI\u2019m hardly the only person that had identified these possibilities, but I do want to continue updating yall with my plan going forward.\n\nPrediction through year end:\nThe selling from this correction is likely over now. May get a couple of dry heaves next week but the heavy selling (-3+% in a given day is likely done). I am waiting to see at least two days of stability in the next week or two. For example, a Green Day like Friday is not stable. Yes it was up which is good, but far from showing footing.\n\nI believe that as the market digests this quick uptick in yields we will settle in and stocks will grind higher towards retesting highs in some names. Many of the momentum names that had eye popping speculative valuations likely won\u2019t be back to highs this year as folks are spooked.\n\nHighs on solid names will be retested by mid May / early June timing as optimism around economy heating up (double edged sword here) and vaccine rollout continues to build. As things reopen I believe the economy is going to run way too hot and inflation will pick up more than expected. I don\u2019t think the fed will have to do anything drastic but the realization that the economy is overheating will cause additional pressure on certain equity valuations yet again. To me, if we retest highs in May I think there is substantially more risk to the downside (10-15% correction again) than to the upside (4-5%)\n\nOnce we get within 1-2% of highs in May I will be building back to roughly 1/3-1/5 cash in my trading portfolio. \n\nHope all of you have some dry powder around and are able to pick up some really solid companies that went on sale in the last week or two! \n\nHappy hunting.", "id": "lz20cg", "created_utc": 1615038880.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "I just googled \" Do markets bottom on Fridays?\" \nOf the 97 market corrections since 1928, markets have bottomed on Monday or Tuesday 54 times.\nWednesday 10 Friday 15, Thursday 18.\nThose are the #s.\nReason for the thinking is that no one wants to hold stocks over a weekend if things are on a downward path. \nBear markets follow the same pattern with lows often on Mondays and Tuesdays and less likely on a Wednesday or Friday. \nI do not know why Wednesday.b", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Really good stuff, and very interesting.

I\u2019m still of the mindset we are in the midst of chop, but I am still holding to the idea that markets head back to retest highs in many names before May. \n\nThe plan for March was always for insitotuonal funds to rotate out of growth that has likely doubled for many in the last year into underplayed names. Any good fund manager had the long term gains timing of March in their heads. What likely exacerbated was the yield run up so quickly. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019d say the market has done a lot of the rotating and that the yield spike has been digested a bit.

Yields generally have fallen. But there are times when yields would go up and bond prices would go down.  This is an analogy for stock prices rising but more specifically about stock prices falling.\n\nIn the case of the fund it was sold to us brokers by the mutual fund company as an excellent income vehicle for our retired clients.  And it was.  We literally poured billions into the fund on behalf of our retirees. (I am retired, not an advisor anymore.)\n\nHere was the catch.  And one you will see on NUSI.  Both had a mandate to pay dividends.\n\nStocks go up:\n\nSo NUSI buys Intel for example.  Its trading around $60 per share.  Nusi writes a 65 call.  Its out of the money.  The stock goes to $80.  NUSI just makes $10 plus the call premium.  NUSI would have been better off holding the stock to $80 and pocketing the $20.\n\nStocks go down:\n\nNUSI does the same thing as before.  $60 INTC, sells a 65 strike call.   Stock goes to $40.  NUSI made the premium but lost $20 on the stock.  \n\nHere's the worst part.  NUSI still  MUST pay dividends.  Just because all their stocks are below what they bought them at, they still have to generate income to pay those dividends.  So they write another out of the money call.  With the stock at $40, they can't write a 55 strike call and get any meaningful premium.  \n\nSo they write a $45.  It's out of the money TO THE CURRENT $40 stock price.  And the stock goes back to $60.  The fund gets called at $45 and immediately books a $15 capitol loss.  \n\nFor as long as the markets stay depressed  and the call strike prices are technically out of the money, they aren't relative to the purchase price.  But they are way down from the original purchase price of the stock.\n\nThe fund gets premium income but the NAV of the fund slowly collapses as they get called for loss after loss.  You got the dividend from the fund but lost  a ridiculous percentage on the original investment.\n\nThe sad part is the mutual fund rep kept telling us, \"We  only write out of the money calls.\"  When pressed, he denied they wrote calls in the money to original stock purchase prices.  But, while technically out of the  money TO THE CURRENT STOCK PRICE, they got deeper and deeper in the money to purchase price as the markets went down.\n\nThough this mutual fund raised billions, clients eventually bailed in droves.

{"title": "Why $NVAX is oversold/really cheap right now, brought to you by your friendly community Pharmacist.", "selftext": "***TL;DR  Market got scared and overreacted big time, sold NVAX to levels lower than when they released P1 (Phase 1) data. Even with a market sell-off, this is something that should recover very well. Expected to recover by May/June latest. It's \\~$175 as of writing this, the fact it's below 200 makes no sense even with this market sell-off!***\n\nContext: I am a community Pharmacist in the UK and have been following vaccine development closely. So I do understand the science behind it fairly well. Also, this is my first DD post so hope it's okay and not too long!\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI will be comparing NVAX to MRNA (Moderna) as they are similar, small companies with COVID being the first vaccine brought to market. There are some differences to bear in mind though, firstly MRNA\u2019s mRNA technology has huge potential in many clinical realms outside of normal vaccinations. The technology could potentially revolutionise cancer therapy, this is where the company has value where NVAX does not. NVAX has been trying to bring a vaccine to market for a longer period of time and on the way have developed technology such as nano-flu, and Matrix-M. So MRNA has tech enabling a greater diversity of therapeutic targets, NVAX is in a better position to provide a vaccine more similar to ones we have seen in the past.\n\nNVAX's latest earnings report missed projections, they are spending money on researching the vaccine further, and investing money into their supply chain (more on this later), I don\u2019t think revenue at this stage of vaccine progress should be that significant, however, the market reacted negatively.\n\nThe dip was more likely influenced by investor skittishness over the fact the FDA are unlikely to issue a EUA for NVAX without completing their US P3 trial, which they did do with MRNA\u2019s vaccine using their UK data. Being first to the market benefited MRNA here.\n\nCombine the above 2 bits of negative news with the recent market sell-off, and you get a big share price drop. This potential crash is a concern for growth companies with little revenue vs the market cap, largely speculative prospects, such as EV companies.\n\nThe whole biotech sector has had a similar sell-off (MRNA has similarly seen dips from these sell-offs, however, their earnings call was better timed and the impact seems to have been reduced vs NVAX). The difference between these companies and TSLA is they have guaranteed cash coming in with these deals in the future, assuming the vaccine is approved.\n\n***This next part is me explaining why NVAX is a great vaccine play if you\u2019re happy with why NVAX is in a great position and the impact of booster shots/annual vaccinations/the supply chain from manufacturer to patient and why NVAX is a winner here, skip ahead.***\n\n**The future for COVID vaccine rollout**\n\nCOVID is not a one-shot deal, it\u2019s increasingly clear we will need to treat COVID like we do with the flu with annual shots to keep up with mutations. This is where NVAX has real potential and the more speculatory part of this DD. NVAX has its nanoflu product that demonstrated great phase-3 results last year before the covid hit.\n\nCEO Stanley Erck has described how a combined vaccination is something the company wants to investigate and produce in the future. MRNA admittedly could make a flu vaccine with it\u2019s technology, but I think it\u2019s less likely due to storage requirements of mRNA vaccines in relation to annual flu rollout, and why I think going forward mRNA vaccines will be seen less for these annual shots etc.\n\nStorage requirements for mRNA are a bitch, need to be maintained at very cold temperatures, and are extremely fragile. So fragile vaccination stations are set up to ensure minimum movement of the product as possible to ensure it doesn\u2019t literally fall apart before administration.\n\nNow, consider the annual flu vaccination set up, in the UK this has historically been delivered on-site to companies, in pharmacies, GPs, hospitals, pretty much anywhere you can get someone trained to hijab with a cool box and you\u2019re set. I see it highly unlikely that this delivery system which has worked so successfully in the past would change to accommodate the mRNA vaccine when other vaccines are able to meet the demands of the previous rollouts. Now, this has happened with COVID for obvious reasons, people needed a vaccine fast and storage requirements can be overcome and it\u2019s worth it for the benefit, but it\u2019s not a long term solution.\n\nNVAX has a similar expiry length of 6 months,  however, can be kept at normal fridge temps (2-8C) vs mRNA vaccine tech (-20C MRNA, -60C PFE), it can be maintained at room temp for up to 24 hours, and won't fall to shit if it\u2019s handled like any other vaccine in use currently.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe risk for NVAX currently is if their vaccine is not approved. I do not see any reason why the vaccine with some of the best results in class (The only \u201cold\u201d style vaccine that can challenge the mRNA vaccine efficacy) would not be approved. I trust the science on this and NVAX is a winner. In terms of how long protection would last, if someone with a greater background in immunogenicity could chyme in here that would be helpful, but my understanding is a higher titer level recorded from the vaccine, the better the immune response, and the longer immunity will last. NVAX titre level from P1 data was best in class, which would indicate it\u2019s the vaccine of choice for long term immunity.\n\n***If you know NVAX is in a great position in terms of vaccine supply & tech then start here:***\n\n**Deals done**\n\nThat brings us on to what countries have ordered NVAX vs other companies. NVAX has the third-highest amount of vaccines pre-ordered in deals worldwide. This is guaranteed cash assuming they get the vaccine out of the door.\n\n[Number of advance purchase agreement by company](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F72761740-7a7b-11eb-919d-0ff232547755-standard.png?dpr=1&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&source=next&width=700)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f593ose28gl61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=898a9eef851132b45467dbb8d61a4236ef3077cf\n\n**Manufacturing capacity**\n\nRemember I mentioned supply chain investment? NVAX is increasing their capacity to be able to produce 2 billion doses a year for 2021 [source](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-agreement-serum), it\u2019s in a better position than MRNA which is hoping for 1.4bln by the end of 2022 [source](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-additional-capital-investments-increase-global). NVAX is ready to churn out doses when the green flag is waved on authorization.\n\n**Market caps**\n\nLet\u2019s compare market caps, nvax is \\~13Bln, MRNA is \\~52bln. MRNA is currently worth 4x NVAX. MRNA does have 2bln more in terms of NTA, but MRNA is either overvalued with speculative price increase due to their future clinical products, or, NVAX is extremely undervalued. I expect it\u2019s a bit of both, but more the latter.\n\n**Why is it cheap?**\n\nWhy is it oversold? The revenue missing targets can be brushed off in my opinion, MRNA also missed projections but the share price increased. The sell-off due to delayed US authorization is the main point here. Look at the above graph and you can see NVAX has most of its agreements made with non-US countries. Also, even if the US authorization is delayed, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re not getting the money from the US, so from a financial standpoint, it\u2019s just a delay to getting cash in.\n\nWhat I think you saw was investor jitteriness of a sell-off due to this delay in FDA authorization, happening as the whole stock market was dropping, and you had increased concerns and people getting out to play it safe. US authorization does not influence other countries in terms of authorization or not. The delay is being blown out of proportion.\n\n[Comparing MRNA to NVAX over the last year, here is MRNA\u2019s price activity covering the last 12 months with points of interest highlighted. ](https://www.tradingview.com/x/BGjHuIyG/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MRNA 12-month chart](https://preview.redd.it/xaxeo5dz7gl61.png?width=1805&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ad64a42d4d978ee415e45630ae296abe54ae4ee)\n\nPost-P3 results you saw a combination of sell the news event, and insiders were restricted from selling stock until after results were released, so you had insiders sell some of their shares. Most significantly you saw hedge funds and money managers selling off stocks that had made large profits as the year closed. MRNA/NVAX both had significant growth this year so both were affected by it.\n\n[Now look at NVAX\u2019s](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ixH0wZgY/). Look familiar?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[NVAX 12-month chart](https://preview.redd.it/mvzr8pg08gl61.png?width=2468&format=png&auto=webp&s=9889727188ca9c9196311928ca581fe9cd3c8fb3)\n\nWhat NVAX has done, is actually reach a low which is **LOWER** than the high they had in Aug 2020 - this was based on a reaction to P1 results! **It hit as low as $147 this week, vs the high of $188 when P1 results were released.**\n\n**Float & volatility**\n\nNvax has a small float, only 60M shares, 50% held by institutions (52% of MRNA is institutions for comparison, but with a 335m, share float), which can lead to large amounts of volatility, which is why I think we\u2019re seeing this massive reaction to what is non-news.\n\n**A point to mention**\n\n[It is worth mentioning a lawsuit was filed ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/novavax-board-accused-of-covid-vaccine-stock-scheme-by-investor)against the board over potential shenanigans over awarding themselves shares before funding from the US government was announced, this snowballed with the above negative sentiment. I am personally not hugely concerned by this as I don\u2019t think it changes anything about why you should be bullish about this play, but if someone disagrees I would appreciate hearing why this should be more concerning than I currently expect it to be.\n\nNothing has changed. Yes the FDA approval may be later but so what? Does that affect anything to do with money coming in through the door? No.\n\n**Price targets**\n\nI know you need to take price targets with a big pinch of salt (pre-P3 results the high target was $180 per share), but as it currently stands:\n\nLow: 207\n\nMedian 310\n\nHigh: 397\n\nAverage: 307\n\n[Source](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NVAX/research-ratings)\n\nLike, are you fucking for real? This is so cheap right now!\n\n**Positions**\n\nI am spread betting on this as i\u2019m in the UK, options aren't really as accessible here. Plus my inept risk tolerance led to my accounts getting almost entirely wiped thanks to a certain  SPAC i can't mention on this sub & the recent sell off. So my position is small as I try to make some money back. I did buy the dip at 150, closed my position down and re-entered later on in the day.\n\nI don\u2019t know enough about the price of options currently, but I imagine a deep OTM call option for August onwards would be safe (I have no idea what the premium looks like though, sorry!)\n\nPosition: \u00a30.17/pt @ 173.9.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(For US people not used to europoor things like spread betting, it's similar to trading on margin but with 0% tax, and that would look like 23.46 shares @ 173.9)\n\n**EDIT 19/03/2020: Congrats on those who got in ~160 the monday after i posted this, closed today at 228.25 (+40%!)**", "id": "lz7f5t", "created_utc": 1615054296.0, "score": 86, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "Great DD, I\u2019ll be buying when I\u2019m on the moon with GME", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "I own alot of nvax but also own gme to hedge against melvin collapsing entire market lol", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Bring new money in bro.

May get a couple of dry heaves next week but the heavy selling (-3+% in a given day is likely done). I am waiting to see at least two days of stability in the next week or two. For example, a Green Day like Friday is not stable. Yes it was up which is good, but far from showing footing.\n\nI believe that as the market digests this quick uptick in yields we will settle in and stocks will grind higher towards retesting highs in some names. Many of the momentum names that had eye popping speculative valuations likely won\u2019t be back to highs this year as folks are spooked.\n\nHighs on solid names will be retested by mid May / early June timing as optimism around economy heating up (double edged sword here) and vaccine rollout continues to build. As things reopen I believe the economy is going to run way too hot and inflation will pick up more than expected. I don\u2019t think the fed will have to do anything drastic but the realization that the economy is overheating will cause additional pressure on certain equity valuations yet again. To me, if we retest highs in May I think there is substantially more risk to the downside (10-15% correction again) than to the upside (4-5%)\n\nOnce we get within 1-2% of highs in May I will be building back to roughly 1/3-1/5 cash in my trading portfolio. \n\nHope all of you have some dry powder around and are able to pick up some really solid companies that went on sale in the last week or two! \n\nHappy hunting.", "id": "lz20cg", "created_utc": 1615038880.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "I just googled \" Do markets bottom on Fridays?\" \nOf the 97 market corrections since 1928, markets have bottomed on Monday or Tuesday 54 times.\nWednesday 10 Friday 15, Thursday 18.\nThose are the #s.\nReason for the thinking is that no one wants to hold stocks over a weekend if things are on a downward path. \nBear markets follow the same pattern with lows often on Mondays and Tuesdays and less likely on a Wednesday or Friday. \nI do not know why Wednesday.b", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Really good stuff, and very interesting.

Instead of stocks they were using US Treasury bonds.  The concept was to sell out of the money covered calls to generate an out sized dividend that was greater than Treasury yields at the time.\n\nAs you recall, we have been in a US Treasury Bull market since 1982.  Yields generally have fallen. But there are times when yields would go up and bond prices would go down.  This is an analogy for stock prices rising but more specifically about stock prices falling.\n\nIn the case of the fund it was sold to us brokers by the mutual fund company as an excellent income vehicle for our retired clients.  And it was.  We literally poured billions into the fund on behalf of our retirees. (I am retired, not an advisor anymore.)\n\nHere was the catch.  And one you will see on NUSI.  Both had a mandate to pay dividends.\n\nStocks go up:\n\nSo NUSI buys Intel for example.  Its trading around $60 per share.  Nusi writes a 65 call.  Its out of the money.  The stock goes to $80.  NUSI just makes $10 plus the call premium.  NUSI would have been better off holding the stock to $80 and pocketing the $20.\n\nStocks go down:\n\nNUSI does the same thing as before.  $60 INTC, sells a 65 strike call.   Stock goes to $40.  NUSI made the premium but lost $20 on the stock.  \n\nHere's the worst part.  NUSI still  MUST pay dividends.  Just because all their stocks are below what they bought them at, they still have to generate income to pay those dividends.  So they write another out of the money call.  With the stock at $40, they can't write a 55 strike call and get any meaningful premium.  \n\nSo they write a $45.  It's out of the money TO THE CURRENT $40 stock price.  And the stock goes back to $60.  The fund gets called at $45 and immediately books a $15 capitol loss.  \n\nFor as long as the markets stay depressed  and the call strike prices are technically out of the money, they aren't relative to the purchase price.  But they are way down from the original purchase price of the stock.\n\nThe fund gets premium income but the NAV of the fund slowly collapses as they get called for loss after loss.  You got the dividend from the fund but lost  a ridiculous percentage on the original investment.\n\nThe sad part is the mutual fund rep kept telling us, \"We  only write out of the money calls.\"  When pressed, he denied they wrote calls in the money to original stock purchase prices.  But, while technically out of the  money TO THE CURRENT STOCK PRICE, they got deeper and deeper in the money to purchase price as the markets went down.\n\nThough this mutual fund raised billions, clients eventually bailed in droves.

If your total is not 1.00 , ask yourself if you are positioned with enough risk or too little.  \n\nAs you do this, you will see which positions give you a lot of volatility and which dont.  \n\nThen look at each position and ask yourself, is this stock percent too small to help me.

Or if the beta is small, way under the S&P, maybe it wont get me the return I am looking for.\n\nIf you are an excel guy, plot the beta versus a return ( as in 1 year performance).  You will easily see the outliers.\n\nThere is no magic number of holdings.  But if you own $10 of a stock in a million dollar portfolio, you should wonder why you own it.\n\nOr if one position is way too high in percent of the portfolio, it will overly affect what the total does.\n\nNext go to portfoliovisualizer.com and load your stocks in their correlation calculator.

{"title": "Why $NVAX is oversold/really cheap right now, brought to you by your friendly community Pharmacist.", "selftext": "***TL;DR  Market got scared and overreacted big time, sold NVAX to levels lower than when they released P1 (Phase 1) data. Even with a market sell-off, this is something that should recover very well. Expected to recover by May/June latest. It's \\~$175 as of writing this, the fact it's below 200 makes no sense even with this market sell-off!***\n\nContext: I am a community Pharmacist in the UK and have been following vaccine development closely. So I do understand the science behind it fairly well. Also, this is my first DD post so hope it's okay and not too long!\n\n**Introduction**\n\nI will be comparing NVAX to MRNA (Moderna) as they are similar, small companies with COVID being the first vaccine brought to market. There are some differences to bear in mind though, firstly MRNA\u2019s mRNA technology has huge potential in many clinical realms outside of normal vaccinations. The technology could potentially revolutionise cancer therapy, this is where the company has value where NVAX does not. NVAX has been trying to bring a vaccine to market for a longer period of time and on the way have developed technology such as nano-flu, and Matrix-M. So MRNA has tech enabling a greater diversity of therapeutic targets, NVAX is in a better position to provide a vaccine more similar to ones we have seen in the past.\n\nNVAX's latest earnings report missed projections, they are spending money on researching the vaccine further, and investing money into their supply chain (more on this later), I don\u2019t think revenue at this stage of vaccine progress should be that significant, however, the market reacted negatively.\n\nThe dip was more likely influenced by investor skittishness over the fact the FDA are unlikely to issue a EUA for NVAX without completing their US P3 trial, which they did do with MRNA\u2019s vaccine using their UK data. Being first to the market benefited MRNA here.\n\nCombine the above 2 bits of negative news with the recent market sell-off, and you get a big share price drop. This potential crash is a concern for growth companies with little revenue vs the market cap, largely speculative prospects, such as EV companies.\n\nThe whole biotech sector has had a similar sell-off (MRNA has similarly seen dips from these sell-offs, however, their earnings call was better timed and the impact seems to have been reduced vs NVAX). The difference between these companies and TSLA is they have guaranteed cash coming in with these deals in the future, assuming the vaccine is approved.\n\n***This next part is me explaining why NVAX is a great vaccine play if you\u2019re happy with why NVAX is in a great position and the impact of booster shots/annual vaccinations/the supply chain from manufacturer to patient and why NVAX is a winner here, skip ahead.***\n\n**The future for COVID vaccine rollout**\n\nCOVID is not a one-shot deal, it\u2019s increasingly clear we will need to treat COVID like we do with the flu with annual shots to keep up with mutations. This is where NVAX has real potential and the more speculatory part of this DD. NVAX has its nanoflu product that demonstrated great phase-3 results last year before the covid hit.\n\nCEO Stanley Erck has described how a combined vaccination is something the company wants to investigate and produce in the future. MRNA admittedly could make a flu vaccine with it\u2019s technology, but I think it\u2019s less likely due to storage requirements of mRNA vaccines in relation to annual flu rollout, and why I think going forward mRNA vaccines will be seen less for these annual shots etc.\n\nStorage requirements for mRNA are a bitch, need to be maintained at very cold temperatures, and are extremely fragile. So fragile vaccination stations are set up to ensure minimum movement of the product as possible to ensure it doesn\u2019t literally fall apart before administration.\n\nNow, consider the annual flu vaccination set up, in the UK this has historically been delivered on-site to companies, in pharmacies, GPs, hospitals, pretty much anywhere you can get someone trained to hijab with a cool box and you\u2019re set. I see it highly unlikely that this delivery system which has worked so successfully in the past would change to accommodate the mRNA vaccine when other vaccines are able to meet the demands of the previous rollouts. Now, this has happened with COVID for obvious reasons, people needed a vaccine fast and storage requirements can be overcome and it\u2019s worth it for the benefit, but it\u2019s not a long term solution.\n\nNVAX has a similar expiry length of 6 months,  however, can be kept at normal fridge temps (2-8C) vs mRNA vaccine tech (-20C MRNA, -60C PFE), it can be maintained at room temp for up to 24 hours, and won't fall to shit if it\u2019s handled like any other vaccine in use currently.\n\n**Risks**\n\nThe risk for NVAX currently is if their vaccine is not approved. I do not see any reason why the vaccine with some of the best results in class (The only \u201cold\u201d style vaccine that can challenge the mRNA vaccine efficacy) would not be approved. I trust the science on this and NVAX is a winner. In terms of how long protection would last, if someone with a greater background in immunogenicity could chyme in here that would be helpful, but my understanding is a higher titer level recorded from the vaccine, the better the immune response, and the longer immunity will last. NVAX titre level from P1 data was best in class, which would indicate it\u2019s the vaccine of choice for long term immunity.\n\n***If you know NVAX is in a great position in terms of vaccine supply & tech then start here:***\n\n**Deals done**\n\nThat brings us on to what countries have ordered NVAX vs other companies. NVAX has the third-highest amount of vaccines pre-ordered in deals worldwide. This is guaranteed cash assuming they get the vaccine out of the door.\n\n[Number of advance purchase agreement by company](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/https%3A%2F%2Fd6c748xw2pzm8.cloudfront.net%2Fprod%2F72761740-7a7b-11eb-919d-0ff232547755-standard.png?dpr=1&fit=scale-down&quality=highest&source=next&width=700)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f593ose28gl61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=898a9eef851132b45467dbb8d61a4236ef3077cf\n\n**Manufacturing capacity**\n\nRemember I mentioned supply chain investment? NVAX is increasing their capacity to be able to produce 2 billion doses a year for 2021 [source](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-covid-19-vaccine-manufacturing-agreement-serum), it\u2019s in a better position than MRNA which is hoping for 1.4bln by the end of 2022 [source](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-additional-capital-investments-increase-global). NVAX is ready to churn out doses when the green flag is waved on authorization.\n\n**Market caps**\n\nLet\u2019s compare market caps, nvax is \\~13Bln, MRNA is \\~52bln. MRNA is currently worth 4x NVAX. MRNA does have 2bln more in terms of NTA, but MRNA is either overvalued with speculative price increase due to their future clinical products, or, NVAX is extremely undervalued. I expect it\u2019s a bit of both, but more the latter.\n\n**Why is it cheap?**\n\nWhy is it oversold? The revenue missing targets can be brushed off in my opinion, MRNA also missed projections but the share price increased. The sell-off due to delayed US authorization is the main point here. Look at the above graph and you can see NVAX has most of its agreements made with non-US countries. Also, even if the US authorization is delayed, it\u2019s not like they\u2019re not getting the money from the US, so from a financial standpoint, it\u2019s just a delay to getting cash in.\n\nWhat I think you saw was investor jitteriness of a sell-off due to this delay in FDA authorization, happening as the whole stock market was dropping, and you had increased concerns and people getting out to play it safe. US authorization does not influence other countries in terms of authorization or not. The delay is being blown out of proportion.\n\n[Comparing MRNA to NVAX over the last year, here is MRNA\u2019s price activity covering the last 12 months with points of interest highlighted. ](https://www.tradingview.com/x/BGjHuIyG/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[MRNA 12-month chart](https://preview.redd.it/xaxeo5dz7gl61.png?width=1805&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ad64a42d4d978ee415e45630ae296abe54ae4ee)\n\nPost-P3 results you saw a combination of sell the news event, and insiders were restricted from selling stock until after results were released, so you had insiders sell some of their shares. Most significantly you saw hedge funds and money managers selling off stocks that had made large profits as the year closed. MRNA/NVAX both had significant growth this year so both were affected by it.\n\n[Now look at NVAX\u2019s](https://www.tradingview.com/x/ixH0wZgY/). Look familiar?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[NVAX 12-month chart](https://preview.redd.it/mvzr8pg08gl61.png?width=2468&format=png&auto=webp&s=9889727188ca9c9196311928ca581fe9cd3c8fb3)\n\nWhat NVAX has done, is actually reach a low which is **LOWER** than the high they had in Aug 2020 - this was based on a reaction to P1 results! **It hit as low as $147 this week, vs the high of $188 when P1 results were released.**\n\n**Float & volatility**\n\nNvax has a small float, only 60M shares, 50% held by institutions (52% of MRNA is institutions for comparison, but with a 335m, share float), which can lead to large amounts of volatility, which is why I think we\u2019re seeing this massive reaction to what is non-news.\n\n**A point to mention**\n\n[It is worth mentioning a lawsuit was filed ](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/esg/novavax-board-accused-of-covid-vaccine-stock-scheme-by-investor)against the board over potential shenanigans over awarding themselves shares before funding from the US government was announced, this snowballed with the above negative sentiment. I am personally not hugely concerned by this as I don\u2019t think it changes anything about why you should be bullish about this play, but if someone disagrees I would appreciate hearing why this should be more concerning than I currently expect it to be.\n\nNothing has changed. Yes the FDA approval may be later but so what? Does that affect anything to do with money coming in through the door? No.\n\n**Price targets**\n\nI know you need to take price targets with a big pinch of salt (pre-P3 results the high target was $180 per share), but as it currently stands:\n\nLow: 207\n\nMedian 310\n\nHigh: 397\n\nAverage: 307\n\n[Source](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NVAX/research-ratings)\n\nLike, are you fucking for real? This is so cheap right now!\n\n**Positions**\n\nI am spread betting on this as i\u2019m in the UK, options aren't really as accessible here. Plus my inept risk tolerance led to my accounts getting almost entirely wiped thanks to a certain  SPAC i can't mention on this sub & the recent sell off. So my position is small as I try to make some money back. I did buy the dip at 150, closed my position down and re-entered later on in the day.\n\nI don\u2019t know enough about the price of options currently, but I imagine a deep OTM call option for August onwards would be safe (I have no idea what the premium looks like though, sorry!)\n\nPosition: \u00a30.17/pt @ 173.9.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(For US people not used to europoor things like spread betting, it's similar to trading on margin but with 0% tax, and that would look like 23.46 shares @ 173.9)\n\n**EDIT 19/03/2020: Congrats on those who got in ~160 the monday after i posted this, closed today at 228.25 (+40%!)**", "id": "lz7f5t", "created_utc": 1615054296.0, "score": 86, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "Great DD, I\u2019ll be buying when I\u2019m on the moon with GME", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "I own alot of nvax but also own gme to hedge against melvin collapsing entire market lol", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Bring new money in bro.
