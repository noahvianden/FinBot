In the last decade, the ionic conductivities of some TSEs (e.g., Li6-xP5-xX1+x (X = Cl, Br) [23,24], Li6+xGexP1-xS5I [25], Li10GeP2S12 (LGPS) [26], and Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3 (LSiPSCl) [27]) have been found to be comparable to or even exceed that of liquid electrolytes. \n\nHowever, the main challenges for the application of TSEs in ASSBs are its poor electrochemical and mechanical stabilities, leading to a constant increase in interfacial resistance during cycling [28,29]. \n\nMoreover, TSEs are chemically unstable against metallic lithium, forming interphases that cause an increase in the local current density at the Li/TSEs interface and lithium dendrite growth [16].\n\nSulfide solid electrolytes (e.g., lithium thiophosphates) have the highest room-temperature ionic conductivity (\u223c10\u22122\u00a0S\u00a0cm\u22121) among solid Li-ion conductors so far, and thus have attracted ever-increasing attention for high energy-density and safety all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs). \n\nHowever, interfacial issues between sulfide electrolytes and electrodes have been the main challenges for their applications in ASSBs. \n\nThe interfacial instabilities would occur due to side reactions of sulfides with electrodes, poor solid-solid contact, and lithium dendrites during charge/discharge cycling. \n\nIn this review, we analyze the interfacial issues in ASSBs based on sulfide electrolytes, and in particular, discuss strategies for solving these interfacial issues and stabilize the electrode-electrolyte interfaces.
