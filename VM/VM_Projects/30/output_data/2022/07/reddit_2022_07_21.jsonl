{"title": "TSLQ and other single stock ETFs", "selftext": "So basically you probably knew this but the SEC allowed single stock ETFs like a week ago. TSLQ is one that shorts Tesla and the one I am mostly interested in. \n\nPeople have drastically underrated how much this changes things. Literally everything will be different in my opinion. People were saying this is just options with extra steps and let me explain why I think its not. \n\nFirst of all you can buy options on these for a massive discount. Let me explain:\n\r\nTesla options are very very expensive. \r\nIf we look at a date like 8/19 (the first available options for TSLQ) we can see that the calls and puts are over 50.00 dollars so over 5k to buy them. And some are even more pricey and the further out you go (date wise) the higher cost overall.\r\n\n\nTSLQ as you would guess are way cheaper. A lot of contracts still have yet to be filled (in my experience the lowest i was able to get was 2.00 for a contract that plummeted already) and 2.75 for one of the 0s. \r\n\n\nTo me this will drastically change and will climb closer to the Tesla prices because these are again just a way to buy discounted Tesla options. For example TSLQ shorts Tesla therefore I have purchased puts (my positions are at the bottom) so really I basically bought calls on Tesla. Buying puts on a Tesla bear ETF = buying Tesla calls for much cheaper. \n\n\r\nThe issue is that the trading volume is low which is because it's new in my opinion. Once people start realizing that you can do this and it is accessible in Robinhood I think the will go up to easily a 1:5 TSLQ to Tesla ratio. \r\n\nThat's just my theory though and I put a lot of money into trusting it (a lot for me cause im broke, not a lot for many of you).\n\n\n\r\n**TLDR:**\r\nBuying puts on TSLQ (Tesla bear ETF) = buying cheap calls on Tesla. \n\nI am not betting necessarily that TSLQ will get to whatever I buy my call/put at I am betting that before it expires people will realize the potential and upside to these insanely undervalue things.\r\n\n\n\nMy positions \n\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1-Fi7Vkn3Uh7P37Ljdfqkx0pu_QrL4BcP/view?usp=drivesdk\r\nWish I had more money I can take this risk with but I hope you all could capitalize on it. (Which also makes me money, obviously)\r\nAnd again I am confident and am fine with taking L if I'm wrong but on the one that I'm down like -190 or whatever that is like 95% of what I put it.
