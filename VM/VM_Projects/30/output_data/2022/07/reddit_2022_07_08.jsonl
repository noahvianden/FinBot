Follow up to [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vu8y7g/market_impact_of_abe_assassination_thoughts_from/ifc4pgk/?context=3) from earlier this morning summarizing my own thoughts and incorporating comments from people who are smarter than me and my dog combined. For all intents and purposes, my dog came up with all of what follows and she doesn't even eat crayons. Her diet withstanding, none of the following is investment advice and you shouldn't listen to any of it because remember, a dog came up with all of it. She's a cute dog, but still a dog.\n\n***From GS:***\n\n>*From Global Market Insights*  \n>  \n>Abe headlines not helping risk, unclear the implications ahead of upper parliamentary elections this weekend (Abenomics historically had a very pro growth, monetary and fiscal policy) .  \n>  \n>*From GS Japan Market Wrap - 7/8*  \n>  \n>Japan Monday: Eco: Money Stock, Core Machine Orders, Machine Tool Orders ...  \n>  \n>Earnings: Cosmos, Lawson, Shochiku  Buy/Sell Skew: Overall +, Foreign LO +, Foreign HF +, Domestics -  \n>  \n>Japanese equities (NKY +10bps, TPX +27bps) closed marginally higher after paring AM gains on headlines released during lunch: \\*JAPAN'S EX-PM ABE COLLAPSES IN NARA, SHOTS HEARD. ABE IN CARDIAC ARREST. NKY futures reached new lows, indicating down -1.4% prior to PM open and trading \\~27% of the full days\u2019 volumes by 12:10pm, while USDJPY tumbled back to 135 handle immediately after the release.\n\n***From MS***\n\n>**MS JPY Rates Daily July 8, 2022**\\*:\\*  \n>  \n>**JGB/Swap: Former PM** **Abe** \\*\\*shot - is that anything to do with Bo J?\\*\\*It was supposed to be a quiet Friday and indeed so before the shocking headline \u201cJAPAN'S EX-PM ABE COLLAPSES IN NARA, SHOTS HEARD\u201d hit the newswire just after the morning close. The initial reaction was a knee-jerk JB futures plunge hitting 148.94 (-0.53), as possibly the headline was associated with the termination of Abenomics and Kuroda-Abe relationship but the weakness was short-lived and trimmed almost all the losses into 3pm close after all. We also believe this is less to do with monetary policy as the current PM Kishida still continues Abe\u2019s legacy / Abenomics and maintains good relationship with Kuroda. Flow wise, overnight session saw decent x-market paying in 5y5y on s dr and 10y LCH paid 3.75bps underperforming JB futures itself, whilst international rm managers were better buyer in sub-10y sector, which richened 5-10yr sector as w by 2-3bps. We would like to see more domestic rm managers activity after the upper house election this weekend, as BoJ is unlikely to move this month, so we prefer flattener (5y30y or 20y30y) and 30y a s w.**Vol:**\u00a0Headline about post PM Mr.Abe has accelerated sell-off in delta in Afternoon session, JPY vol went well bid from front-end with little volume traded in market. 2y15y which is typical point where domestic sells, we saw short covering from domestic names, also 1m5y were paid up from usual gamma seller domestics. As risk events ahead of us together with uncertainty from sudden headlines, gamma is in strong needs everywhere.\n\n***From me:***\n\nThere will be knock on effects consistent with an FX rate shift in the short term at least, curious if this will make it easier for the Liberal Democratic Party to get things done however (eg. restart nuclear power plants which would have a material impact on Japan's current account given how much they spend importing fossil fuels).\n\nTrading some FX outright counting on JPY appreciation/flight to quality and buying 1) Japanese nuclear power complex + 2) military industrial complex (eg. defense contractors) + 3) Lockheed Martin to start. Abe is a firebrand very supportive of building up the military and expanding use of nuclear energy. I do think he is right in those priorities but with an election coming up in TWO days I\u2019ve got to believe the public and the diet will be much more supportive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dty1lluxcca91.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa0bf72be8632123c61c80913c0c9f7dc90ef00e", "id": "vu8y7g", "created_utc": 1657281127.0, "score": 200, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|30|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|41|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vu8n0f/market_impact_of_abe_assassination_is_risk_off/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vu8uw5/market_impact_of_abe_assassination_thoughts_from/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vu8y7g/market_impact_of_abe_assassination_thoughts_from/) \n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vu8y7g)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vu8y7g)\n    \nHey /u/silversnoopy, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4483869969844818}, {"body": "First thoughts how can I profit off this assassination", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "No that was my third thought.

Follow up to [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vu8y7g/market_impact_of_abe_assassination_thoughts_from/ifc4pgk/?context=3) from earlier this morning summarizing my own thoughts and incorporating comments from people who are smarter than me and my dog combined. For all intents and purposes, my dog came up with all of what follows and she doesn't even eat crayons. Her diet withstanding, none of the following is investment advice and you shouldn't listen to any of it because remember, a dog came up with all of it. She's a cute dog, but still a dog.\n\n***From GS:***\n\n>*From Global Market Insights*  \n>  \n>Abe headlines not helping risk, unclear the implications ahead of upper parliamentary elections this weekend (Abenomics historically had a very pro growth, monetary and fiscal policy) .  \n>  \n>*From GS Japan Market Wrap - 7/8*  \n>  \n>Japan Monday: Eco: Money Stock, Core Machine Orders, Machine Tool Orders ...  \n>  \n>Earnings: Cosmos, Lawson, Shochiku  Buy/Sell Skew: Overall +, Foreign LO +, Foreign HF +, Domestics -  \n>  \n>Japanese equities (NKY +10bps, TPX +27bps) closed marginally higher after paring AM gains on headlines released during lunch: \\*JAPAN'S EX-PM ABE COLLAPSES IN NARA, SHOTS HEARD. ABE IN CARDIAC ARREST. NKY futures reached new lows, indicating down -1.4% prior to PM open and trading \\~27% of the full days\u2019 volumes by 12:10pm, while USDJPY tumbled back to 135 handle immediately after the release.\n\n***From MS***\n\n>**MS JPY Rates Daily July 8, 2022**\\*:\\*  \n>  \n>**JGB/Swap: Former PM** **Abe** \\*\\*shot - is that anything to do with Bo J?\\*\\*It was supposed to be a quiet Friday and indeed so before the shocking headline \u201cJAPAN'S EX-PM ABE COLLAPSES IN NARA, SHOTS HEARD\u201d hit the newswire just after the morning close. The initial reaction was a knee-jerk JB futures plunge hitting 148.94 (-0.53), as possibly the headline was associated with the termination of Abenomics and Kuroda-Abe relationship but the weakness was short-lived and trimmed almost all the losses into 3pm close after all. We also believe this is less to do with monetary policy as the current PM Kishida still continues Abe\u2019s legacy / Abenomics and maintains good relationship with Kuroda. Flow wise, overnight session saw decent x-market paying in 5y5y on s dr and 10y LCH paid 3.75bps underperforming JB futures itself, whilst international rm managers were better buyer in sub-10y sector, which richened 5-10yr sector as w by 2-3bps. We would like to see more domestic rm managers activity after the upper house election this weekend, as BoJ is unlikely to move this month, so we prefer flattener (5y30y or 20y30y) and 30y a s w.**Vol:**\u00a0Headline about post PM Mr.Abe has accelerated sell-off in delta in Afternoon session, JPY vol went well bid from front-end with little volume traded in market. 2y15y which is typical point where domestic sells, we saw short covering from domestic names, also 1m5y were paid up from usual gamma seller domestics. As risk events ahead of us together with uncertainty from sudden headlines, gamma is in strong needs everywhere.\n\n***From me:***\n\nThere will be knock on effects consistent with an FX rate shift in the short term at least, curious if this will make it easier for the Liberal Democratic Party to get things done however (eg. restart nuclear power plants which would have a material impact on Japan's current account given how much they spend importing fossil fuels).\n\nTrading some FX outright counting on JPY appreciation/flight to quality and buying 1) Japanese nuclear power complex + 2) military industrial complex (eg. defense contractors) + 3) Lockheed Martin to start. Abe is a firebrand very supportive of building up the military and expanding use of nuclear energy. I do think he is right in those priorities but with an election coming up in TWO days I\u2019ve got to believe the public and the diet will be much more supportive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dty1lluxcca91.png?width=1160&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa0bf72be8632123c61c80913c0c9f7dc90ef00e", "id": "vu8y7g", "created_utc": 1657281127.0, "score": 200, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|30|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|41|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vu8n0f/market_impact_of_abe_assassination_is_risk_off/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vu8uw5/market_impact_of_abe_assassination_thoughts_from/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vu8y7g/market_impact_of_abe_assassination_thoughts_from/) \n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vu8y7g)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vu8y7g)\n    \nHey /u/silversnoopy, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4483869969844818}, {"body": "First thoughts how can I profit off this assassination", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "No that was my third thought.
