{"title": "OTM Puts Jump, ATM Puts Gauss", "selftext": "**Discussion: should one sell ATM straddles/strangles to finance a purchase of OTM puts, using zero DTE options?**\n\n### Abstract\n\nWe analyze the high-frequency dynamics of S&P 500 equity-index option prices by constructing an assortment of implied volatility measures. This allows us to infer the underlying fine structure behind the innovations in the latent state variables driving the evolution of the volatility surface. In particular, we focus attention on implied volatilities covering a wide range of moneyness (strike/underlying stock price), which load differentially on the different latent state variables. We conduct a similar analysis for high-frequency observations on the VIX volatility index as well as on futures written on it. **We find that the innovations over small time scales in the risk-neutral intensity of the negative jumps in the S&P 500 index, which is the dominant component of the short-maturity out-of-the-money put implied volatility dynamics, are best described via non-Gaussian shocks, i.e., jumps. On the other hand, the innovations over small time scales of the diffusive volatility, which is the dominant component in the short-maturity at-the-money option implied volatility dynamics, are best modeled as Gaussian with occasional jumps.**\n\nSource: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\\_id=2350997](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2350997)", "id": "xnilo9", "created_utc": 1664097856.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 28, "comments": [{"body": "What?

{"title": "Just my 2 cents on what to do during all this selling off", "selftext": "I am 29, so maybe I am naive and maybe I have just been lucky in the past. I did time March 2020 correctly with buying up stocks right before the very bottom. For context I bought up VOO, QQQ, W, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA all on March 20, 2020. The bottom was on March 23, 2020. I did not care if I had caught the bottom. I just new when I pressed \"buy\" on my brokerage accounts that I had a discount on all of these ETFs and stocks. Did I get lucky to some degree? Sure. Maybe. \n\nI sold almost everything in August 2022 for a slight profit (note that I sold everything in April 2022 and bought back in early July 2022: VOO, AAPL, MSFT, TSLA). I am up this year, while everyone around me is down. So my plan for this next week is to buy back up in mass quantity until I only have 5% of my portfolio in cash. I will be buying up VOO, QQQ, SCHD, METV, TSLA, GOOG, SOFI. I will consider buying up the following if and only if they dip another 3% the next week: NVDA, V. \n\nSo, here is the dip people. This next week will not trade sideways because we just don't do that in the USA after a massive sell off like we have had. We will either trade up or down but not sideways. So starting Monday make your moves. Buy up ETFs and stocks you want to hold for years. I messed around with SQQQ and broke even twice this year. My 2 cents on inverse/short ETFs is to not touch them.
