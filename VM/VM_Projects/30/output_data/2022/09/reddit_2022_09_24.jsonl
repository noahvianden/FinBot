These media giants have convinced many small investors they can\u2019t compete with big institutions \u2013 with all their computers and degrees and money. It just isn\u2019t true. When this happens, people act accordingly. When they believe it, they buy stocks for a week, and they buy options, and they buy the Chile fund this week. Next week it\u2019s the Argentina fund, and they get results proportionate to that investing style. That\u2019s bothersome. The public can do extremely well in the stock market on their own. The fact that institutions dominate the market today is a positive for small investors. These institutions push stocks on usual lows. They push them on usual highs.

People hear a tip on a bus on some stock and they\u2019ll put half their life savings in it before sunset, and they wonder why they lose money in the stock market. When they lose money, they blame it on the institutions and program trading. That is garbage. They didn\u2019t do any research.

There are reasons for stocks to go up. This is magic. It\u2019s a magic number, easy to remember. Coca-Cola is earning 30 times per share what they earned 32 years ago. The stock has gone up thirtyfold. Bethlehem Steel is earning less than they did 30 years ago. The stock is half its price of 30 years ago. Stocks are not lottery tickets.

When this happens, people act accordingly. When they believe it, they buy stocks for a week, and they buy options, and they buy the Chile fund this week. Next week it\u2019s the Argentina fund, and they get results proportionate to that investing style. That\u2019s bothersome. The public can do extremely well in the stock market on their own.

People hear a tip on a bus on some stock and they\u2019ll put half their life savings in it before sunset, and they wonder why they lose money in the stock market. When they lose money, they blame it on the institutions and program trading. That is garbage. They didn\u2019t do any research.

There are reasons for stocks to go up. This is magic. It\u2019s a magic number, easy to remember. Coca-Cola is earning 30 times per share what they earned 32 years ago. The stock has gone up thirtyfold. Bethlehem Steel is earning less than they did 30 years ago. The stock is half its price of 30 years ago. Stocks are not lottery tickets.
