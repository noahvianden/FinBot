{"title": "Are t Yahoo Message boards hacked and controlled by Funds?", "selftext": "\n\n\n\nRite Aid stock (RAD) has all the ingredients for a GME style runner. RAD has $24 Billion RAD makes $476 million in Free Cash Flow. RAD has Institutional ownership of 71% according to Fintel and shows 27% of the floated shares shorted, but it's likely higher with Dark Pool shares shorted. RAD now has only 54 million RAD shares outstanding. With 15 million shares shorted. It wouldn't take much to trigger squeeze. Now my whole point to this comparison is to say. This discussion isn't all about how it's no way Shorts can cover RAD without a major spike. This about the Rite  Aid Yahoo  message board. Any positive comments seem to get removed or deleted. Positive sentiment posters get blocked from posting. Now I know other posters there have had the same experience, but I want to know have  other posters like on the AMD or GME Yahoo message board had issues.
