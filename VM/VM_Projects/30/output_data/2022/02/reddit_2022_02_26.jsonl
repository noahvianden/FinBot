LEAPs allow for leverage without margin, with a much more forgiving timeframe. Theta decay is almost non-existent if you only hold your LEAPs for a month\n\nYour point of crying about losing money in a market down term for LEAPs feels moot, as they would also be crying when their 30-45 DTE is down with even less time to recover and theta eating away.

I stated they are better for 90% of the people that buy LEAPS. \n\nWhy? Because those people want high reward with the lowest possible risk. No shit you say? Buckle up because this is going to hit close to home for many people. \n\nThe problem is that people think that buying LEAPS will give the underlying stock time to climb back up in the event of a drawdown, while still the retaining significant leverage that options afford. To some degree this is correct. If they were using LEAPS properly. \n\nBut no. What do most people do when buying LEAPS? They buy the lowest cost LEAPS (very OTM) they can find and because they have a year or two to sit back and make money they ALWAYS put in more money than they can afford to lose. \n\nWhat happens next? Johnny McOptions put his life savings into very OTM MSFT LEAPS. There\u2019s a drawdown and he sees his investment reduced by 10, 15, 25%. This isn\u2019t money he can afford to lose. He has 343 DTE, is down 25% and panics. What do they almost always do? Wait or sell? Yep. You got it right because they sell. 2 months later MSFT is back at or past their breakeven maybe even 10% up. Guy kicks himself for selling early and losing 25% when they coulda been up 20% had they just held. \n\nNow at what point did Theta come in to play? Right it did not. It didn\u2019t even matter. Nor would it. \n\nOk so why are 0-45 DTE better for these people? Because they are gambling and know it when it\u2019s on those timelines. They will (usually:more often) adjust their expenditure so they are not throwing their life savings at the short term options. \n\nWill they still lose money? Yes. But more importantly the fire will burn them more times in smaller doses (instead of third degree burns across the entire body all at once from LEAPS). And maybe getting burned more times for less will teach them how to not be idiots with their finances. Maybe they\u2019ll even learn how to use LEAPS properly. \n\nWhich is? Buy ITM/ATM LEAPS for leverage along with real stock. 30/70 split or whatever floats your risk tolerance boat. Is it sexy? Yes. Is it 10 bagger sexy?

Same number of contracts. Same expiry. Strike price is really up to you. You\u2019re making a vertical (debit) spread out of your long call with no margin/cash requirements (collateral are your ITM calls). \n\nYes it will limit (and cap) your remaining upside, but you will collect a large premium to offset your initial cost. I can tell you that it makes a huge difference psychologically in wanting to sell, especially when you\u2019re in a drawdown and seeing losses in the call offset by gains in the covered calls. \n\nThe nice thing about LEAPS done this way is you can do some magic you normally can\u2019t (easily) do with vertical debit spreads. So for example if you have 190/160 AAPL spread, once AAPL goes under 158 you start getting to a point where you can buy to cover your CC, meaning you just paid yourself for borrowing money from yourself, and removed the upside cap for your long calls.

{"title": "Warren Buffett: Buy Stocks At Wartime", "selftext": "Stocks around the world rose on Friday as investors welcomed talk of renewed diplomacy after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and as coordinated Western sanctions left Russia's energy sector largely untouched. The U.S. dollar fell and oil prices dipped as investors bet that the sanctions wouldn't have a significant impact on the global economy.\n\nFor U.S. companies, the Russian and Ukrainian operations are small potatoes. Businesses in both countries account for just 1 percent of total S&P 500 sales, according to FactSet, a research firm. But American manufacturing companies and catering companies have been entering the Russian market one after another since the 1990s--until the Crimea crisis in 2014 when many firms reduced their Russian operations.\n\nGM and Ford Motor exited the Russian passenger car market in 2019, after years of struggling to compete against local producers. Exxon Mobil dismantled an exploration-research business partnership with Russia's state-owned oil company Rosneft following the Crimea crisis.\n\nU.S. chemical and agricultural companies are still doing business in Russia, albeit on a smaller scale than before the sanctions were imposed. Dow, which manufactures resin products and industrial tape outside Moscow, closed down 2 percent yesterday. Shares in Caterpillar, which has factories such as excavators outside St Petersburg, also fell 1 percent.\n\nWarren Buffett has warned investors not to buy gold in times of war, as stock prices have a tendency to rise during such periods. The famed investor made the comments in an interview with American media, citing the Cuban crisis and 9/11 terrorist attacks as examples. Buffett's first stock investment was in 1942, when he was just 11 years old. At that time, stocks were depressed due to the intensifying Second World War, but Buffett later recalled that they would have been worth much less if they had been exchanged for gold instead. In spite of falling oil prices in 2015, stocks only declined modestly compared to the 70% plunge seen in oil prices over 18 months.\n\nOn February 24, the price of WTI crude oil surged above $100 a barrel, approaching the record high of $107 set in June 2014. The rise in prices reflects investors' willingness to challenge the ongoing crisis. While ordinary investors may not be as daring as Buffett, understanding the dynamics of the stock market during this crisis will provide a reference for future investments.\n\nsource: [https://www.riskbrew.com/news/621a2c6c0204e20edcf75c18](https://www.riskbrew.com/news/621a2c6c0204e20edcf75c18)", "id": "t1yek1", "created_utc": 1645885962.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|10 months ago\n**Total Comments**|2|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t1yek1)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t1yek1)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12877854704856873}, {"body": "Its been working for him since world war 1 lol", "score": 28, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25284266471862793}, {"body": "McDonalds & Starbucks operate around 1900 stores there combined.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "So my Puts on McDonald's are safe?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Not with my fat ass keeping them in business.

LEAPs allow for leverage without margin, with a much more forgiving timeframe. Theta decay is almost non-existent if you only hold your LEAPs for a month\n\nYour point of crying about losing money in a market down term for LEAPs feels moot, as they would also be crying when their 30-45 DTE is down with even less time to recover and theta eating away.

I stated they are better for 90% of the people that buy LEAPS. \n\nWhy? Because those people want high reward with the lowest possible risk. No shit you say? Buckle up because this is going to hit close to home for many people. \n\nThe problem is that people think that buying LEAPS will give the underlying stock time to climb back up in the event of a drawdown, while still the retaining significant leverage that options afford. To some degree this is correct. If they were using LEAPS properly. \n\nBut no. What do most people do when buying LEAPS? They buy the lowest cost LEAPS (very OTM) they can find and because they have a year or two to sit back and make money they ALWAYS put in more money than they can afford to lose. \n\nWhat happens next? Johnny McOptions put his life savings into very OTM MSFT LEAPS. There\u2019s a drawdown and he sees his investment reduced by 10, 15, 25%. This isn\u2019t money he can afford to lose. He has 343 DTE, is down 25% and panics. What do they almost always do? Wait or sell? Yep. You got it right because they sell. 2 months later MSFT is back at or past their breakeven maybe even 10% up. Guy kicks himself for selling early and losing 25% when they coulda been up 20% had they just held. \n\nNow at what point did Theta come in to play? Right it did not. It didn\u2019t even matter. Nor would it. \n\nOk so why are 0-45 DTE better for these people? Because they are gambling and know it when it\u2019s on those timelines. They will (usually:more often) adjust their expenditure so they are not throwing their life savings at the short term options. \n\nWill they still lose money? Yes. But more importantly the fire will burn them more times in smaller doses (instead of third degree burns across the entire body all at once from LEAPS). And maybe getting burned more times for less will teach them how to not be idiots with their finances. Maybe they\u2019ll even learn how to use LEAPS properly. \n\nWhich is? Buy ITM/ATM LEAPS for leverage along with real stock. 30/70 split or whatever floats your risk tolerance boat. Is it sexy? Yes. Is it 10 bagger sexy?

Same number of contracts. Same expiry. Strike price is really up to you. You\u2019re making a vertical (debit) spread out of your long call with no margin/cash requirements (collateral are your ITM calls). \n\nYes it will limit (and cap) your remaining upside, but you will collect a large premium to offset your initial cost. I can tell you that it makes a huge difference psychologically in wanting to sell, especially when you\u2019re in a drawdown and seeing losses in the call offset by gains in the covered calls. \n\nThe nice thing about LEAPS done this way is you can do some magic you normally can\u2019t (easily) do with vertical debit spreads. So for example if you have 190/160 AAPL spread, once AAPL goes under 158 you start getting to a point where you can buy to cover your CC, meaning you just paid yourself for borrowing money from yourself, and removed the upside cap for your long calls.

{"title": "Warren Buffett: Buy Stocks At Wartime", "selftext": "Stocks around the world rose on Friday as investors welcomed talk of renewed diplomacy after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and as coordinated Western sanctions left Russia's energy sector largely untouched. The U.S. dollar fell and oil prices dipped as investors bet that the sanctions wouldn't have a significant impact on the global economy.\n\nFor U.S. companies, the Russian and Ukrainian operations are small potatoes. Businesses in both countries account for just 1 percent of total S&P 500 sales, according to FactSet, a research firm. But American manufacturing companies and catering companies have been entering the Russian market one after another since the 1990s--until the Crimea crisis in 2014 when many firms reduced their Russian operations.\n\nGM and Ford Motor exited the Russian passenger car market in 2019, after years of struggling to compete against local producers. Exxon Mobil dismantled an exploration-research business partnership with Russia's state-owned oil company Rosneft following the Crimea crisis.\n\nU.S. chemical and agricultural companies are still doing business in Russia, albeit on a smaller scale than before the sanctions were imposed. Dow, which manufactures resin products and industrial tape outside Moscow, closed down 2 percent yesterday. Shares in Caterpillar, which has factories such as excavators outside St Petersburg, also fell 1 percent.\n\nWarren Buffett has warned investors not to buy gold in times of war, as stock prices have a tendency to rise during such periods. The famed investor made the comments in an interview with American media, citing the Cuban crisis and 9/11 terrorist attacks as examples. Buffett's first stock investment was in 1942, when he was just 11 years old. At that time, stocks were depressed due to the intensifying Second World War, but Buffett later recalled that they would have been worth much less if they had been exchanged for gold instead. In spite of falling oil prices in 2015, stocks only declined modestly compared to the 70% plunge seen in oil prices over 18 months.\n\nOn February 24, the price of WTI crude oil surged above $100 a barrel, approaching the record high of $107 set in June 2014. The rise in prices reflects investors' willingness to challenge the ongoing crisis. While ordinary investors may not be as daring as Buffett, understanding the dynamics of the stock market during this crisis will provide a reference for future investments.\n\nsource: [https://www.riskbrew.com/news/621a2c6c0204e20edcf75c18](https://www.riskbrew.com/news/621a2c6c0204e20edcf75c18)", "id": "t1yek1", "created_utc": 1645885962.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|10 months ago\n**Total Comments**|2|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=t1yek1)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=t1yek1)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12877854704856873}, {"body": "Its been working for him since world war 1 lol", "score": 28, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25284266471862793}, {"body": "McDonalds & Starbucks operate around 1900 stores there combined.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "So my Puts on McDonald's are safe?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Not with my fat ass keeping them in business.
