This had a deflationary effect on the dollar, which restricted lending, which was harming various interests, particularly farmers. A common refrain, then, was to \"free silver\" to be allowed to be minted into dollars again.\n\nThe debate led to a weird compromise in the [Sherman Silver Purchase Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Silver_Purchase_Act), which had a terrible outcome: people took their silver and exchanged it for gold instead of dollars. Eventually the Federal Government ran out of gold to hand out, which caused the worst bank run in US history up until that time - the Panic of 1893.\n\nFrank Baum's allegory, written 7 years into the aftermath of this event, portrayed the farmer Dorothy, the American Everyman, having everything she owns swept up in a tornado into the absurd world of US monetary policy.

{"title": "Tesla DD (\ud83d\ude80)", "selftext": "Ford\u2019s MachE \u2013 a examination of Tesla\u2019s competition, with $TSLA implications\n\nTL/DR upfront:\n\nUpcoming EV competition is *the* driving DD behind the Tesla bear narrative: that EV competition will show up \u00e0 market competition will drive EV prices (and therefore $TSLA margins) down to industry-norms. I think this reasoning is flawed. Ford\u2019s unprofitability with the MachE provides a window into what the competition is facing, and why Tesla is *very likely* to retain unlimited demand and see robust gross margin growth--insulated from the effects of market competition\u2014for several years (until \\~ 2026-2028). \n\n\\---- \n\nArgument:\n\n**Fords issues with EV profitabili**ty (link:  [Ford CFO says inflation has erased Mustang Mach-E profits, but isn't hurting demand (cnbc.com)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/ford-cfo-says-inflation-has-erased-mustang-mach-e-profits-but-isnt-hurting-demand.html) ) i**s a** **PROXY** **for legacy auto\u2019s outlook writ large.** \n\nFord\u2019s \u2018Tesla Killer\u2019 is their Mach E, which is a BEV (full battery) crossover SUV. However, recently Ford announced that they get zero profit from sales of their Mach E. Price information is below. \n\n* The \u2018Standard Range\u2019 RWD (68kwh battery, 230 miles EPA range, the lowest $ base model) is $42,895 before dealer markups and delivery fees\n* The \u2018Extended Range\u2019 (88kwh, 300 miles EPA, the lowest $ long range model) is $52,000 before dealer/delivery\n\nFords lack of Mach-E profitability is VERY interesting because the car is highly priced while also benefiting from several cost-lowering factors:\n\n* $7,500 U.S. federal EV subsidy (Ford has yet to hit the 200,000 vehicle cap for the $7500, at which point it gradually decreases). Tesla buyers do not qualify for any EV tax credits right now. \n* Made in Mexico with cheaper, non-unionized labor \n* Usage of large pouch-style batteries, which are cheaper but lower-quality\n* A more battery-efficient Car form-factor (as compared to a truck), meaning less batteries for a desired range and, therefore, lower cost of production. \n\nIf Ford is unprofitable with a high-priced EV benefiting from $7,500, made in Mexico with lower priced components, how are they going to be profitable with the F150 Lightning? The F150 lightning will,\n\n* Be made by Union labor at U.S. labor prices \n* Have a less-efficient form factor (truck aerodynamics are very bad)\n* Have higher User battery needs (towing range). \n   * F150 lightning loses 50% of its range when towing a 23-foot airstream trailer. Add to this cold-weather battery reductions, heating needs, going up inclines\u2026the trucks 230 mile range\u2019s real drivable radius when towing can get extremely limited very quickly. \n* See a gradually reduced subsidy amount ($7,500 --> $3750 --> $1875) \n\nIt is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future. \n\nAdditionally, Ford has additional issues it has to tackle:\n\n* Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups\n* A need to develop a \u2018supercharging\u2019 network. \n   * Look more deeply into their published numbers\u2014if you nix Tesla\u2019s superchargers (which they can access rn), as Tesla will jack up prices for non-Tesla\u2019s over time (especially when the supercharger network begins to get overburdened), and eliminate low-power chargers, look closely in your area at the ACTUAL NUMBER of high power charging stations individually. There may be chargepoint nodes in your area, but at least in Atlanta, the total stalls are very low. \n* Battery supply shortages --> higher prices for batteries\n   * This is why Fords CEO has been talking about the need for federal support with battery raw material production \n\n**SO WHAT?**\n\n1.  Ford has to raise prices\u2014they have no other choice. \n   1. None of the sub-bullets above (dealership cut, need for expanded charger network, declining subsidy $, higher priced U.S. labor, higher priced batteries with less-efficient form factors) is easily solvable. While Ford talks about separating EVs from its dealership network, that legal fight will take YEARS.  \n2. This same situation will manifest in other legacy automakers \n3. Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can\u2019t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.\n4. Therefore, legacy auto has significant pressure to maintain high prices\n5. Tesla is, therefore, insulated from the price reduction and gross margin contracting effects of market competition. \n\nAdd to this several Tesla-phenomena \n\n1. Tesla\u2019s cost of production will continue to decline, meaning that gross margins will continue to expand \n   1. Technology reasons: dime-casting, structural battery, and 4680 (if it continues to scale) batteries \n   2. Economies of scale reasons: Tesla is centralizing serious production capacity in its main four factories. 50% CAGR can be achieved for several years with the current factory footprint alone. Austin is projected to eventually produce 2 million units alone, per year. I would doubt these projections if it wasn\u2019t for Tesla\u2019s record setting CAGR\u2014which has surprised the entire industry over the past three years. \n2. Therefore, because Tesla has more \u2018buffer\u2019 to decrease prices\u2014in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future \n\nConclusion\n\nTesla will be able to maintain unlimited demand for its cars and will have minimal pressure on gross margins from market competition for several years into the future. While some legacy auto (VW) MIGHT produce EVs in large numbers, this will not negatively impact Tesla gross margins. \n\nWould **love** for folks to put forward a strong counter argument. I have several $TSLA 2024 leaps and, if I am wrong in my assumptions here, would muuuuuch rather know that my thinking is faulty than continue to sit on this volatile position.", "id": "vm23gv", "created_utc": 1656353965.0, "score": 8, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|180|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|3760|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kidiv0/aapl_ev_is_good_for_tesla/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kn6iy2/its_a_boomer_play_but_its_guaranteed_money_ge/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kst6uo/its_a_boomer_play_but_its_absolutely_guaranteed/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vm23gv/tesla_dd/) [x](https://i.redd.it/hsaw0898xpn61.jpg) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fbw8tl/lil_yachty_dropped_a_new_album_first_track_is/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/eeon3u/dd_invest_in_norway_norw/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lj98g6/tsla_is_the_only_ev_company_outside_of_china/) \n**Account Age**|9 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vm23gv)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vm23gv)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2683694362640381}, {"body": "I think this is just a reason not to buy into any vehicle company for the longterm right now.

They're giving people an incentive to buy their car. That's literally competition. There's is a particular demand at a certain price range. And in general, the lower the price, the higher the demand.\"Oh, I wish I had the money to buy a TSLA\" is not demand.\n\nWhat Tesla is doing is giving themselves a cushion to reduce prices. Here's the kicker though - every other manufacturer already has this. Ford can afford to sell the Mach E at zero profit, because people buy F150's everyday. So can GM, Toyota, Honda, Stellantis....ok maybe not Stellantis, VW, Mercedes, Audi, Kia and even Hyundai. And they will take a temporary hit on their margins. This is not inherently wrong, it's market forces at work. More Competition tends to benefit the consumer.\n\nIt's weird how everyone thinks that scaling manufacturing is something that TSLA invented. Do you really think that Ford won't be able to reduce prices as they increase how many cars they produce a year? Further, 2M cars a year is a lot, for a 10 year old company. But it doen't even crack the top 10 by vehicle production.\n\n*It is very possible that the F150 Lightning begins to see razor-thin profit margins (or none at all) over the near future.*\n\nThis is possible, but unlikely. Because the new F150 uses \\~ 30% of the parts of the old ICE F150. Do you really think that's an accident?The F150 is America's best selling truck. The F150 electric will take all that heritage and destroy competition. They have an advantage. They don't need to re-invent the truck - they just have to not Fuck up. Which maybe harder than it seems, but it's def easier than what RIVIAN and TSLA are trying to do.\n\n*Legacy auto debt levels (looking at Ford and VW, in particular) mean they can\u2019t afford to produce less cars or see zero profit.*\n\nLook at that as a % of annual revenue, look at their debt servicing costs relative to gross profit.\n\n*Growing percentages of EV sales will reduce dealership income (most of which is derived from maintenance and repair), leading to more pervasive markups*\n\nThis is unlikely. The US vehicle fleet gets overhauled by \\~8% a year. That 8% is unlikely to be  all electric for a long time. Dealerships that act in bad faith will simply not get allotments, and newer ones will take their place. Alternately, legacy automakers will do a direct to consumer sales model or maybe partner with someone like Carvana. Sidenote : Fuck CVNA. Check out [https://www.amazon.com/adlp/hyundaishowroom](https://www.amazon.com/adlp/hyundaishowroom) as an example.\n\n*Therefore, because Tesla has more \u2018buffer\u2019 to decrease prices\u2014in an environment that is continuing to improve and in the context that legacy auto faces), Tesla has the ability to win any price war for several years into the future*\n\nTSLA has the ability to win the price war in the  electric premium mid size sedan, electric premium compact SUV and electric luxury full size sedan range. That's quite a bit, but there are other, far more profitable vehicle segments that exist too.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Valuable comment", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.071492500603199}, {"body": "Holy shit.
