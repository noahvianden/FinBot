{"title": "I\u2019ve solved it. And I did it while you morons are out here drawing straight lines on pictures of crooked lines. The last DD you\u2019ll ever need.", "selftext": "I won\u2019t waste time presenting you regards with too many facts that you\u2019re small minds can\u2019t handle, so here\u2019s the brief background. While y\u2019all were busy figuring out how to zoom in and out of graphs online I was busy mastering the blade and honing my knowledge of astrophysics. Then in the middle of perfecting the final kata of the Hiten Mitsurugi-ry\u016b style to slay my master my minds eye opened and I saw it all. (That\u2019s the end of the background).\n\nSo we all know inflation is hitting hard by now, but so few truly see the big picture. The why. What if I told you to go back to 2008? You\u2019d immediately think Obama and the recession, but you\u2019d only be half right. You\u2019re thinking of the wrong Obama. It all starts and ends with Michelle. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s truly retarded\u201d you say, but I\u2019m way past retarded. I\u2019m wearing a bright yellow helmet to bed at this point. You see it starts with her and her one goal. She never hid it. In fact she always left it right there in the open because she counted on y\u2019all being too stupid to see it. War on the fattys.\n\nShe saw in 2006 the recession was coming and knew it was her time to strike. She\u2019d been planning it for decades. She\u2019d positioned herself perfectly and was ready to strike with her good friend Jerome Powell. You morons never wondered why a democrat would nominate a republican to the federal reserve? You blind silly stupid fools. \n\n\u201cHow could they possibly be connected?\u201d you ask. Well now we\u2019re getting somewhere. It\u2019s obvious, they both graduated from Princeton. That\u2019s it. There doesn\u2019t need to be more. Occam\u2019s razor.\n\nSo back to 2008 and the war on the fattys. The housing market had collapsed and we were at the bottom with the first black president. No one would have any more room in there primitive minds to think about fighting for the true tendies. The fried and edible kind. She started slow, removing soda from schools and slowing progressed to the most draconian measures possible to destroy your precious BMIs. She believed by attacking our children we\u2019d all be living in her hellscape of pelatons and unsalted asparagus by the end of the presidency. \n\nBut then something she didn\u2019t count on. The rising stock market gave people more money to buy more tendies. And without homes they had nowhere to cook so they fled in droves to holy places of McDonald\u2019s and Chick Fil A, the last bastions of true American freedom.\n\nShe was distraught with such a stupid miscalculation. How could she not have seen this? Then she realized an evil truth. She had unwittingly defeated herself by coming out of the recession. The key to destroying the fried life blood of American goodness was the recession itself.\n\nThat\u2019s when she had to go back to her secret confidant Powell and they decided no more half measures. They needed someone in the place of power. She used her husband\u2019s marionette presidency to get Jerome to the Fed. Then it truly began.\n\nThey sent the stock market to the moon and created this internet fad of calling money \u201ctendies\u201d because of what it could buy. They were removing the gold standard right in front of your regarded little eyes as you slowly forgot why you even wanted money in the first place. Of course it would be too obvious if they wholly replaced the true tendies with the fake green vegetable colored ones, so the created the Trump diversion. She had learned from the 08 recession and subsequent rise that sometimes you had to do the exact opposite of what logic would dictate to get the results you want.\n\nThey would give us what we need to the most extreme extent. Money flowing like water and tendies of every form rose out of nowhere. A holy land where there was a Canes\u2019s, Layne\u2019s, Golden Chick, Popeye\u2019s, KFC, Wendy\u2019s, and every other form of fried chicken on every street corner in America. We were fatter and happier than ever before, but we went too far.\n\nShe used a rare walrus virus to kill all the old people and intelligent citizens who knew not to get vaccinated or where masks. With the smart ones out of the way she and Powell were free to print trillions and inflate the market as high as they wanted.She then used Elon\u2019s space lasers to hack the voting booths and get Biden in and that was that.\n\nNow the plan cannot be stopped. We\u2019re all too fat and there is no one smart or strong enough left to roll us to streets to fight back. It started with gas. When no one can afford to drive we\u2019ll be forced to walk and ride bikes and all other forms of torturous exercise. Of course it doesn\u2019t matter for most of us because the trump years have all but guaranteed enough artery cloggage to ensure widow maker heart attacks. But our children will grow up thinking this tyranny is how it\u2019s always been.\n\nThen it was the corn and wheat. With cost rising and food replenishing they have started making smaller portions. You\u2019ve all seen the \u201cdouble stuffed\u201d Oreo and \u201cthick cut\u201d bacon posts. She\u2019s in control of the manufacturers so of course the packaging won\u2019t change as she feeds you less and less. \n\nSlowly she took our true tendies as we were distracted worrying about the fake tendies. Soon our kids will only know Kale chips and Sevia poisoned Flint water. We are a victim to our own arrogance.\n\nI could on, but it\u2019s pointless. Michelle has won. Thanks Obama.\n\nTLDR: Michell Obama is behind the recession to continue her unholy war on the fattys. \n\nPositions: \nSPY 350P 9/16\nPTON 300C 9/16", "id": "vla6mi", "created_utc": 1656265584.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|7|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|26|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vla6mi)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vla6mi)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1518728882074356}, {"body": "This is truly regarded.", "score": 29, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.044417984783649445}, {"body": "You had me at Occam's razor.", "score": 14, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14258456230163574}, {"body": "This was more better than I thought", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03565410524606705}, {"body": "Please take all unbabying talk to another subreddit.

{"title": "I\u2019ve solved it. And I did it while you morons are out here drawing straight lines on pictures of crooked lines. The last DD you\u2019ll ever need.", "selftext": "I won\u2019t waste time presenting you regards with too many facts that you\u2019re small minds can\u2019t handle, so here\u2019s the brief background. While y\u2019all were busy figuring out how to zoom in and out of graphs online I was busy mastering the blade and honing my knowledge of astrophysics. Then in the middle of perfecting the final kata of the Hiten Mitsurugi-ry\u016b style to slay my master my minds eye opened and I saw it all. (That\u2019s the end of the background).\n\nSo we all know inflation is hitting hard by now, but so few truly see the big picture. The why. What if I told you to go back to 2008? You\u2019d immediately think Obama and the recession, but you\u2019d only be half right. You\u2019re thinking of the wrong Obama. It all starts and ends with Michelle. \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s truly retarded\u201d you say, but I\u2019m way past retarded. I\u2019m wearing a bright yellow helmet to bed at this point. You see it starts with her and her one goal. She never hid it. In fact she always left it right there in the open because she counted on y\u2019all being too stupid to see it. War on the fattys.\n\nShe saw in 2006 the recession was coming and knew it was her time to strike. She\u2019d been planning it for decades. She\u2019d positioned herself perfectly and was ready to strike with her good friend Jerome Powell. You morons never wondered why a democrat would nominate a republican to the federal reserve? You blind silly stupid fools. \n\n\u201cHow could they possibly be connected?\u201d you ask. Well now we\u2019re getting somewhere. It\u2019s obvious, they both graduated from Princeton. That\u2019s it. There doesn\u2019t need to be more. Occam\u2019s razor.\n\nSo back to 2008 and the war on the fattys. The housing market had collapsed and we were at the bottom with the first black president. No one would have any more room in there primitive minds to think about fighting for the true tendies. The fried and edible kind. She started slow, removing soda from schools and slowing progressed to the most draconian measures possible to destroy your precious BMIs. She believed by attacking our children we\u2019d all be living in her hellscape of pelatons and unsalted asparagus by the end of the presidency. \n\nBut then something she didn\u2019t count on. The rising stock market gave people more money to buy more tendies. And without homes they had nowhere to cook so they fled in droves to holy places of McDonald\u2019s and Chick Fil A, the last bastions of true American freedom.\n\nShe was distraught with such a stupid miscalculation. How could she not have seen this? Then she realized an evil truth. She had unwittingly defeated herself by coming out of the recession. The key to destroying the fried life blood of American goodness was the recession itself.\n\nThat\u2019s when she had to go back to her secret confidant Powell and they decided no more half measures. They needed someone in the place of power. She used her husband\u2019s marionette presidency to get Jerome to the Fed. Then it truly began.\n\nThey sent the stock market to the moon and created this internet fad of calling money \u201ctendies\u201d because of what it could buy. They were removing the gold standard right in front of your regarded little eyes as you slowly forgot why you even wanted money in the first place. Of course it would be too obvious if they wholly replaced the true tendies with the fake green vegetable colored ones, so the created the Trump diversion. She had learned from the 08 recession and subsequent rise that sometimes you had to do the exact opposite of what logic would dictate to get the results you want.\n\nThey would give us what we need to the most extreme extent. Money flowing like water and tendies of every form rose out of nowhere. A holy land where there was a Canes\u2019s, Layne\u2019s, Golden Chick, Popeye\u2019s, KFC, Wendy\u2019s, and every other form of fried chicken on every street corner in America.
