Do we think this is a bear market rally? or have we hit the bottom and will trade sideways for a bit? I do no think we will hit all time highs within this year (although what do i know), but if you do would love to know why. \n\nSome of the facts / upcoming factors:\n\n\\-CPI: We know inflation is high, potentially (hopefully) peaked, but still decently high (if estimates for May are 8.2% its not really going down fast yet) with huge inventory numbers from walmart, target, etc it may suggest as cathie wood has said we see inflation go down big quick, potentially deflation. Although gas prices and utilities are still skyrocketing\n\n\\-QT started / interest rates going up: less money in the world, less borrowing, potentially (probably) more slowdown \n\n\\-Q2/Q3 earnings: even if we do not go into a recession (on paper or not), we are already starting to see from Q1 guidance that future earnings reports will not be great. Mix in recession fears, or a recession itself, future earnings will be tough to top for most stocks\n\n\\-Potential rate hike pause or slowdown: Anthony Pomp is thinking inflation will go down big time, and we will be in a bad recession, the fed will pause, or maybe even decrease rates (2h of year), this would be good for market and economy cuz inflation would be going away and incentivize spending again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this point I am not sure what has been priced in or not (lol), and please comment if i missed any other big headwinds (I'm sure i have).

{"title": "Some details about the IDRA 9kT Press showcased to the public in June 2022.", "selftext": "Alright so as I said a couple of days ago, IDRA is showing the new 9kT press to potential customers/investors/students in their HQ in Brescia. \n\nA couple of notes before posting the pictures: When reserving my spot for the day, I told them I was a student, which is true. I was under the assumption that the students visit would have been structured the same way as the investors/customers visit, where we would first have a detailed briefing of the new press and then a tour of the factory. Turns out this was apparently only for that particular group of people, we student only got to see the finished press and speak a bit with some engineers, if we had easy questions. In retrospect, this makes total sense: lots of reserved IP here that you don't wanna speak about unless absolutely necessary. No complaints here, totally fine. Getting some juicy details like the financials of such a project would have been cool, but I understand why it wasn't possible. If I had gone with the other group (the more business-related one), I would have been like a fish completely out of water, believe me.\n\nAlso, I should say I know absolutely nothing about mechanical and/or material engineering. My background is in a different engineering field. Maybe somebody with experience in these fields will appreciate more than me the pictures and maybe provide more informations.\n\nAnyway, the photos are here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/18OeouJzak9ls016LpUSbG4yLYJETPabp\n\nSome of the cool tidbits I gathered:\n\n-\tSpoke with a couple of the engineers there, briefly. The exchange literally went like this: \n\nMe: \"So... would I be wrong to say this whole thing will be going to Tesla in the near future?\"\n\nThem: \"Uhhh... we can't speak about our clients but... I mean, it's painted red and white so....\n\n-\tA detailed mechanical drawing of the press was being displayed at the side of the press, with most of the accurate measurements as far as I can tell. Photos included in the Gdrive folder, taken with permission. Very cool. The 688000 kg weight value is nutty.\n\n-\tIDRA is aware of some of the competitors, local and not, but they feel they have some key advantages that none else can replicate at the moment. No further details given, obviously.\n\nThe guys working there seemed very proud of the complete project.\nSo that's it. I wish I could share more. As I said, I expected a bit more details but in retrospect it makes sense why they don't want complete strangers to get access to the most private informations. Perhaps I can plan this whole thing a bit better if they ever showcase a bigger press in the future. I could say something like \"yo I've been in tsla since before you started supplying your good stuff to them. I want to buy a small press for personal reasons. Now tell me literally everything.\"\n\nBottom line is, this beast is real and it's very, very big.

{"title": "Friday's CPI Is Make Or Break - Why May's CPI Print Is Pivotal To Equity Markets", "selftext": "May's CPI is probably the most important CPI reading of this year.\n\nEconomists are predicting a 7.2% headline and a 5.4% core YoY, which is what the Fed cares more about. If the reading comes around expectations, it will show a drastic slowdown in CPI and could be a tell tale sign that inflation has indeed peaked in March.\n\nThis thinking is also reflected in the most recent Fed minutes where participants are still expecting a 'precipitous' drop in inflation later on in the year. It is also important to note that while 7.2% is the consensus among economists, JPM is forecasting a 8.1% reading. If the reading does come well above the 7.2% estimate, then it can mean that inflation has not in fact peaked or that it is coming down much slower than anticipated, which will mean the Fed needing to become even more hawkish than they already are.\n\nIt is also important to note that in May of 2021, we saw the first spike in inflation to 3%, meaning this time, we have the base effect in the bull's favor, after all, we are now comparing growth rates to a much higher base at the same time last year.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvdZuknyTfk&t=701s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvdZuknyTfk&t=701s)\n\nWSJ has a more detailed take on this.", "id": "v6x6hy", "created_utc": 1654612176.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|79|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|1874|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s85ipj/fed_will_hike_rates_45_times_this_year_this_is/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbvqcy/an_indepth_look_into_aphria_aphato_and_why_this/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0z2zy/an_in_depth_look_into_robloxrblx_and_why_i_am/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5et6z/gme_is_more_than_about_the_squeeze_its_about_an/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbrul4/an_in_depth_look_into_aphria_aphato_and_why_this/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rfy1y4/fed_will_hike_rates_in_july_a_2nd_time_in/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcvy7b/an_in_depth_look_into_aphria_aphato_and_why_this/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obmn9v/an_in_depth_look_into_peloton_why_this_stock_is/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=v6x6hy)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=v6x6hy)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21717685461044312}, {"body": "The numbers Mason...what do they mean", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "VORKUTA!!!!!", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.010043878108263016}, {"body": "> important to note that in May of 2021, we saw the first spike in inflation to 3%,\n\nit means we can have vodka soaked bread instead of just bread on friday", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12137231230735779}, {"body": "Why the dude on the pic look like a waiter when you ask them \"how big are the sandwiches?\"", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Bruh you're going to hell ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04204542189836502}, {"body": "Can 100% confirm that is the exact face*\n\n*Used to run a sandwich shop where the bread the sandwiches would be on was right there in front of the customer", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5270364284515381}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.05891622230410576}, {"body": "Not sure where you got these numbers.
