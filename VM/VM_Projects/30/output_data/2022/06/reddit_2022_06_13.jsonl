{"title": "RDBX Missing the real issue", "selftext": "I know that a few are talking about the options, but most of the chatter is about the short interest.  I think traders have this backward.  I made a ton of money in the GME squeeze, but I lost money for months prior in options trying to time it, having it beaten down by Gabe and Andrew time after time.  The shorts were able to manipulate it until enough attention was drawn to the short float which turned it into the gamma squeeze.  You should be focusing on the gamma squeeze, knowing that it\u2019s what ends up forcing the shorts to capitulate.  \n\nI believe that this is going to be easier to time than GME because the float is so small that it\u2019s easy to see that the gamma squeeze has already begun (on a Friday with big call OI expiring OTM).  There are 76m shares of GME in existence, while this has 12.6m.  GME was like trying to get the Titanic to take off like a rocket in that we had to get all those shares moving.  It was also the first time that social media played a huge role in a squeeze.  This has 6x less shares OS (36x less if you consider float of 1.95m), and is a much worse math problem for both shorts and MM\u2019s because of the Gamma risk.  On top of all that, all of social media (and really everyone in the United States) is waiting for the next GME because it\u2019s all the country talked about for a week, and FOMO is real.  This post will lay out why this math is more compelling than GME (I never thought I\u2019d say this, as I never thought shorts would be dumb enough to let it happen again).\n\nI want to make it simple so people without that much experience can understand it.  There are many things to consider when trying to predict a squeeze, but I think there are two things that matter most: short interest as a percentage of float, and gamma risk as calculated by call options expiring ITM as a percentage of float.\n\nGME had a short float of 141%.  However, at the time of the squeeze the market cap was much bigger.  I can\u2019t remember how many call contracts were expiring ITM on the Friday that began the squeeze when it went from $42 to $76, but it\u2019s likely that that it wasn\u2019t crazy, as a percentage of float, because it had a market cap of $3.5b (maybe someone can look up that historical data).  Typically a stock will close less than 1% of call options in the money as a percentage of float.  In gamma squeeze situations this is higher\u2026 maybe 8-12%.  So let\u2019s say GME had 20% of options as a percentage of float expiring ITM on 1/22/21\u2026 that\u2019s why it began to rocket that day\u2026 the shorts simply couldn\u2019t push harder than the MM\u2019s who needed to hedge their gamma risk anymore.\n\nWith a short interest of over 220%, RDBX is far worse for shorts than GME.  But the one thing they have going for them is that at Friday\u2019s close with a market cap of $166m, RDBX has a much smaller cap than GME did so they can still push it around\u2026 But something changed yesterday.  According to Thursday close numbers (without Friday trade which was huge volume), RDBX had 19k contracts (1.9m share equivalent) close ITM.  That\u2019s 97% of available float that needs to be delivered!  I\u2019m pretty sure this has never happened before, and is why the squeeze began yesterday.\n\nBut the thing that is absolutely mind blowing about the RDBX squeeze is that you can argue that the real squeeze hasn\u2019t even started yet.  When you look at next weeks call OI (again, at Thursday close, excluding Friday trade), you see that this coming Friday at the 6/17 triple witching expiry there are 59k contracts ITM at the $13 strike and under.  Between yesterday and this coming Friday, 4x of the float (and 80% of all shares OS for that matter) will have call options that are ITM.  \n\n220% short float + 300% OI calls expiring ITM\u2026 This is absolutely mind boggling to me.  With options volumes in the markets the highest they\u2019ve ever been, I\u2019m pretty sure there has never been a setup like this.  The math here is so much more compelling than GME.  \n\nI\u2019m excited at the potential of making a life changing amount of money, but also have that same feeling I had with GME and what made me get out at the right time.  I was prepared to hold GME into the thousands because I knew that I had the math right.  I was like \u201cthe only way this doesn\u2019t happen is if they kill it, and if they don\u2019t kill it, it\u2019s going to crash the market\u201d.  So I didn\u2019t have an exit price target\u2026 I had a \u201csell when they crush it\u201d target.  The morning it broke that RH and IB were turning off the buy button, I, like many, sat in disbelief for a few moments, knew that was it, and then sold.\n\nThe math here is much more compelling and I\u2019m pounding the table even harder.  This squeeze IS going to happen this week if they don\u2019t crush this thing early Monday.  I don\u2019t have an exit target\u2026 I have a \u201cI don\u2019t know how they make this stop, but when the excuses start rolling in on why it has to stop\u201d, that\u2019s my exit.", "id": "vb64tm", "created_utc": 1655103619.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 40, "comments": [{"body": "Lets have a look.

If you have them with your broker, you are a beneficiary owner. Which means your broker has it in their name. Not yours. But you kinda have part ownership. *kinda* this dividend will go to the real certified shares. If your broker gets the dividend and your share isn\u2019t real, they will give you something else of a equivalent. Could cost you some potential future gains. And they are in control of your shares too. It can blow up and they\u2019ll sell for you in special events. It\u2019s in their terms and conditions. So considering gme can be a black swan event, people are taking no chances. DRS itself is a catalyst to DRS and that leads to gme potentially having the biggest event. Market is falling. Gme is holding up okay tho. Isn\u2019t it weird? \n\nYeah the place you can look how DRS is going for gme is in recent gme filings. They list the drs numbers. I heard it\u2019s rare for any company to do that. You\u2019ll have to do some math to calculate the percentage. \n\nWe can wait for DRS but it serves many purposes. We just want to own our shares. Other catalysts are Marge calls and dividends and marketplaces. They can create more buying pressure and drs.. another note, The SEC is making fun of meme stocks and investors who invest in them in their recent YouTube video. Rather peculiar isn\u2019t it? SEC raising red flags about actual companies and saying \u201cthey are considered meme stocks\u2026don\u2019t put your money there\u201d 2nd coming? We\u2019ll wait however long we have to.

{"title": "Disney CEO Bob Chapek fires rumoured Successor Peter Rice", "selftext": "From the NYP Full article here:\n\nMorale is at an all-time low at the beleaguered Mouse House after Disney CEO Bob Chapek dumped TV content boss Peter Rice.\n\nRice, who joined Disney after the media giant acquired 21st Century Fox in 2019, was replaced on Thursday by his number two, Dana Walden, in what many have described as a \u201cshocking\u201d shakeup.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not good for the company. Morale is terrible,\u201d a Disney insider told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nNo reason was given by Disney as to why Rice was let go, but sources buzzed Thursday that Chapek sharpened the axe before it fell on him after he butted heads with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\n\u201cDuring all the press about the DeSantis fiasco, it\u2019s incredibly uncomfortable, for a CEO whose power is slipping away, to have the person who is seen as your successor sitting in the room with you,\u201d the source told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cYou kill that person.\u201d\n\nChapek has had a slew of missteps since he took the helm in 2020, including grappling with the fallout from his fumbling response to Florida\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d law.\n\nPeter Rice \u2014 a former exec at Fox \u2014 was seen by some at Disney as a potential CEO successor to Bob Chapek.\n\nAs his boss flip-flopped on his response to DeSantis\u2019 legislation, enraging Disney employees, Rice issued his own memo at the time, saying, \u201cPersonally, I see this law as a violation of fundamental human rights.\u201d\n\nThat likely didn\u2019t win any points with Chapek, or other execs, who viewed Rice as someone who didn\u2019t conform to Disney\u2019s more buttoned-up corporate culture.\n\nRice broke the news of his firing to employees Thursday in a collegial memo, capping a tumultuous ride at the company.\n\n\u201cI am so proud of the work we have done together, the friendships we have forged and the consistent success we have celebrated,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs I depart Disney, may I leave you with a last thought: remain committed to excellence and always recognize that our stories are dependent upon the imagination and artistry of the writers, directors, producers, actors, and craftsman that we have engaged to call Disney home.\u201d\n\nRice, who had more than three decades of experience in the entertainment industry, soared at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox Entertainment, where he grew the profile of Fox Searchlight, green-lighting some of its highest grossing, critically-acclaimed films like \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine.\u201d\n\nHis success at the division led him to a promotion overseeing the media giant\u2019s TV assets. The star exec was brought over to Disney three years ago, where he oversaw the division that made over 300 shows a year for platforms like ABC, Disney Channel, Disney+, Hulu and FX.\n\nRice\u2019s number two, Dana Walden, was elevated by Chapek to replace her former boss.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a bad guy, just grew up in the wrong corporate culture,\u201d a source told The Post Thursday, citing cumulative issues over time for the rift.\n\nBut the bad press for a company that had run rather smoothly under Chapek\u2019s predecessor, Bob Iger, caused some in Hollywood to speculate if Chapek was up to the job.\n\n\u201cChapek\u2019s contract is up in a year and a half,\u201d a Hollywood executive told The Post in April. \u201cI\u2019d be worried.\u201d\n\nSince taking the Disney reigns in 2020, Chapek has had a slew of missteps.\n\nAccording to reports, Disney has yet to re-sign Chapek, but Rice\u2019s dismissal did come with a vote of confidence from Disney\u2019s chairman Susan Arnold, who backed the CEO\u2019s decision on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe strength of The Walt Disney Company\u2019s businesses coming out of the pandemic is a testament to Bob\u2019s leadership and vision for the company\u2019s future,\u201d she said. \u201cIn this important time of business growth and transformation, we are committed to keeping Disney on the successful path it is on today, and Bob and his leadership team have the support and confidence of the Board.\u201d\n\nAxing a potential successor isn\u2019t new in the cutthroat world of media, nor is it an anomaly at Disney.\n\nIger purged chief operating officer Tom Staggs in 2016 when the exec was widely seen as the CEO\u2019s successor, and Michael Eisner pushed out Jeffrey Katzenberg in 1994.", "id": "vbojnf", "created_utc": 1655159995.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m convinced Chapek is there to do the dirty work.

So Apple has the ability to target a surprisingly low number of underlying hardware variants and maintain a limited number of viewports and screen resolutions, allowing them to quite sustainably deploy software on a wide range of vehicles. The nature of auto is to keep variants down because you\u2019re supporting hem for a couple decades, so this naturally plays in to that simple supportability.\n\nAs a side benefit, Apple gets to practice at cars and brain rape the industry as a trusted partner to see what works and what doesn\u2019t, before stabbing them in the back and being able to do it better themselves once they\u2019ve perfected it and also build the hardware, where they could deploy a completely different OS they don\u2019t give to anyone else and tune it further because they control the whole package. \n\nAlso Google is doing it, so if they don\u2019t the cede the space to Android\u2026", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6274198293685913}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, back when Steve was there", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.041837893426418304}, {"body": "How long has CarPlay existed?\n\nI'll tell you, eight years.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08635532855987549}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04200858250260353}, {"body": "Yeah agreed won\u2019t be hard to see them have all other cars have fully UI controls like a Tesla and self driving.

One wonders if your interest in TSLA is because it was such a big hype stock for 2021 - so there's a real selection bias there.\n\n2021 is a pretty short time period for a meaningful backtest.  If your premise is that the 2021 performance is much more predictive/relevant to 2022 than earlier years, you might come up with some studies on price persistence.  i.e., of a basket of say 100 stocks, what is the correlation of returns (underlying, no need for options) from 1 year to the next over the past decade or more.  Otherwise, again a bit of a cherry pick.  Side note, Tiingo has very cheap historic daily price datasets for US stocks.  Norgate is also good, but pricier.\n\n12 trades is not statistically significant.  My average Iron Condor makes about 4% return on risk.  But if you only looked at my first 50 Iron Condors, my average was negative.  It's hard to tell if a trade strategy is even profitable after less than 100 trades, much less measure any kind of expected performance.\n\nAnyway, I hope my comments aren't discouraging - I'm just a random stranger on the interwebs anyway.

I'm currently working on expanding to other strategies, eg strangle and wheel, etc. Once I'm comfortable with the app I'll probably buy more options data to have a bigger sample size and bigger pool of stocks.\n\nCan you point me to any resources on how to calculate the the correlation of returns from 1 year to the next?

I just suggested it to talk you out of assuming 2021 was relevant by itself, which sounds like isn't your thinking anyway.\n\nbokeh is nice because the plots are interactive.  You can zoom in, export to a png, that kind of stuff.  It's 100% python if you don't need some crazy custom widget.  Other than that it's basically feature-parity to matplotlib.
