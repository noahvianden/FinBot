It is not the best time to be opening bullish positions unless you are long oil, gas, or materials right now.  Even there it looks like these might be finally starting to cave under the downward pressure with UNG, XOM, and a few others struggling a bit at these levels.\n\nYour idea of writing aggressive calls isn't a horrible idea.  You're going to get about $600-$800/week depending on volatility so it is a good way to recoup some of your losses.  On the other hand, you have 18 months to make this back.  If you do think this is the start of a longer term bear market like 2001 or 2008 rather than just a flash-crash like 2018 and 2020, then your best option is not to play around and just get out now for as little damage as you can.  Only you can make this decision.  Traders are usually naturally optimistic so it doesn't surprise me that a good portion of the comments are to just hold and it will come back.  However, you bought a $205 strike, that's only 20% away, which is not that much of a stretch if a sustained bear market is on the horizon.\n\nGo with your gut, but make sure you do research first.  Don't just hodl because hodling is cool.  Don't just sell because you are panicking that you are down a few thousand (assuming this isn't a huge deal as you let on in your post).  If you really want to try and salvage the position, writing weeklies is a smart thing to do.  Based on what I can see, it looks like if you started churning weeklies would cap your max loss moving forward to about $6500 (assuming you only sold 1 call for next week).  I think there's a very good possibility you can write away $6k in premium.  Bi-weekly, 0.3 delta is going to net you ~$300-$350.  If my math is correct, and you sell nothing but aiming for $350 every two weeks, assuming you never get called away, you will earn $12,600 in premium from now until then. \n\nIf your call costed you more than that, abandon it.  If it was less than that, and you think there's even a small chance it could rally or bounce in the next 18 months, then hold onto it because you may come out green on this at the end of it all.

Are you serious? When you buy (or go long) a put (or call), who do you think is on the other side of that position? I have like 20 open short put positions. You've never heard of a put spread? How do you think those work?\n\nIf you're long a put, you have the right to sell at the strike if you exercise. If you're short a put, you are obligated to buy at the strike if the option is exercised.\n\nThe reason it's similar to a covered call is because if you're short a put, then on expiration, if the price of the stock is below the strike, you're obligated to buy the stock. And if the price is above the strike, the option expires worthless. Similarly, with a covered call, if the price expires under the strike, you keep the shares you had. And if the price expires above the strike, you don't have shares anymore. So in both scenarios, on expiration, your position will be the same.\n\nIn the long put scenario, if you buy a put and don't own shares, then on expiration, if the option is ITM, you will sell at the strike, and have an open short position on the stock. The reason it's similar to shorting the stock and buying a call is because, on expiration, if the share price is below the call strike, the call will expire worthless, and you'll also be left with a short position. On the other hand, if the price is above the strike, the long put option expires worthless, and you have no position. Or in the case of shorting stock + buying a call, if the stock is above the strike, then your call will be ITM, and the shares you buy would close the short, again leaving you with no position.\n\n\nFurthermore, as mentioned in my previous post, the gains and losses are mostly identical (including option time value). Here's an example:\n\nCurrent price on stock ABC is $100. A $95 put costs $1. The equivalent $95 strike call should be worth $6 ($1 time value, $5 intrinsic).\n\nScenario 1: buying a $95 strike put for $1.\n\n- (ITM scenario) Stock closes at $92: put option is $3 ITM, so I profit $2.\n- (OOM scenario) Stock closes at $96: option is worthless, I lost $1, and end up with no position.\n\nScenario 2: buying a $95 strike call option for $6 and shorting stock for $100.\n\n- Stock closes at $92: the call option expires worthless. I gain $8 on my short position, but I lost $6 on the call. Profit is $2.\n- Stock closes at $96: the call option is ITM, so I buy shares at $95 and sell at $96, which is a $1 gain. I cover my $100 short with the shares that I just acquired for $96, which gives me a $4 gain. But my call option cost me $6, giving the trade a total loss of $1. I'm left with no position.\n\nYou can try it out with any closing price you want, the gain/loss will always be the same.
