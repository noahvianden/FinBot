What are AMD's future prospects? Is it possible that, in 20 years, AMD could have a year with a revenue growth rate of 30% (not saying 30% CAGR for the next 20 years - just wondering if it has the business model to be able to pull off impressive growth at any given point of time in the future)?

Their chips have seen gaming and crypto-mining tailwinds. It is the GPU leader, bar none. Most compellingly, its chips are used in data centers which is the most attractive part of the semiconductor side of its portfolio.\n\nAMD - makes processors for computers like Intel but its absolutely destroying Intel and eating that company's market share, which makes it a big winner. It also makes GPUs like NVDA, but they're not market-leading. It's chips are also used in data centers, which has seen explosive growth.\n\nPersonally, I think both stocks look expensive. I can't pretend to understand where NVDA sits in the AI development world, so I stay away because the semiconductor side seems a bit overpriced especially as we hear gaming companies come out with less-than-stellar quarters and the recent crypto crash. I'd buy this stock for the data center story and AI story, but at lower multiples.\n\nAMD is more reasonably valued and is probably near fair value since it is such a share-taker in its space. \n\nI believe there are better chip stocks out there than these two, especially given their higher multiples, that being said there is no doubt these are best-in-breed chipmakers and companies, and I wouldn't argue passionately that you wouldn't see returns even investing at these levels but given their strong outperformance recently I personally would wait for a price correction for jumping in.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "AMD reiterated its revenue guidance for the full year couple days ago, which will put them at 20 PE in current stock price.\n\nThey have also guided for 20% CAGR for the next 3 years.
