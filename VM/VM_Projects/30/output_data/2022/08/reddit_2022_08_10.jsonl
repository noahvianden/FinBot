We also failed to even hit the 30day volume average. Are bulls still exhausted? Is this a buying the rumor sell the news type of event? \n\nTomorrow will be pretty interesting to watch. We obviously saw weakness earlier this week and end of last week. However, its clear that people are still buying but now that we got the CPI news what is the next bullish catalyst to push us up? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wleu2e3s7yg91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e98a84f02d12badfe6ca263c5dc0139569100f3\n\nSPY has an impressive rising wedge forming on the daily (solid red lines). We rejected it perfectly today. I am surprised we did not break through this resistance today as this felt like an easy layup for the bulls to take spy to a 3% plus green day. \n\nNext major resistance I have is at 421.1 and then 423.7. \n\nOne key takeaway I have from today is that we did back test the daily 200ema and we are holding that support very well. I do favor that as a bullish omen for the markets. \n\nWe are seeing an impressive $3.97 gap on the daily though. We now have three pretty large daily gaps with two down near 370s and now this one in the 410s. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dmmxq3qs7yg91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a43305755af44e1c3c5f2c2ee2055dcd72f9e2ef\n\nSpy weekly is looking pretty bullish though. We have held the weekly 9 week long bull channel support and now we are looking to test this weekly rising wedge. Resistance for the weekly to watch is 423 and key support is now 415. \n\nIf we continue to trend like this I have little hesitation in saying that we touch the 430s next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xmhj7dct7yg91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1013900f7b2941c50e5caafcf0e0fac10b7c22d8\n\nES futures is in the same boat. Key resistance remains at 4223 for the rising wedge and then 4275 for the next rising wedge. \n\nSupport is now at 4184 the daily 200ema followed by 4140. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hkuao6yt7yg91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4899599e98b6cb8605ca97329dd67c52d4f2f56\n\nFutures weekly never did confirm the bull support however we are not trending over that weekly resistance level of 4163. A close over that and I do suspect that we see 4300s next week. \n\nRising wedge resistance is 4232 and support is that 4163 level tomorrow. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yoeyoeku7yg91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebf8a53de06faaae4ad702c0cd8cb90ffae5cd57\n\nApples like that gold fish that no matter how neglected it is, how often you feed it, how often you don\u2019t change the water, or how often the cat tries to eat it\u2026 that mofo just don\u2019t quit. \n\nApple broke through the rising wedge (this is the one that spy/ es rejected today\u2026 omen for tomorrow? Most likely) and closed over the support level of 168.9. \n\nFrom here apple is on a mission to test the bear market resistance level of 173-174.5 depending on how quickly we get there. We now have two MASSIVE gaps on the Apple daily. We have a $1.86 gap from July 29th and then todays $1.08 gap. When will we fill these gaps? This week? Next week? 2023? Who knows at this point\u2026 Apple on a mission for green and I hesitate to bet against that. \n\nKey resistances- 171.8 -> 172.8\n\nKey support- 168.9 -> 166.5 -> 164.9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95lc5i6v7yg91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=902b4257d02803cdaf1ad71b9039f734c801f333\n\nThe VIX has just continued to go lower and lower and lower. I am a little impressed that it bounced directly off my falling wedge support line though and that it didn\u2019t dump into the 18s today. However, the VIX is on an almost 9 week long unwind. \n\nInterestingly enough the bounce today is at the median high level that the VIX spent most of its time at in 2021. The low end is closer to 15.5. If we continue to see the VIX unwind we are going to be looking at a new possible range of 15.5 to 19.75. \n\nHistorically I would say most of 2022 has been spent between 18.6 and 25.5 or 25.5 and 34.7. I would even venture to say that most of 2022 has been spent well over 25.5\u2026. Is there a reversion to mean expected here? Do we short term revert or do we long term revert? \n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall today and really this week has been a great week for me. I was swinging that Apple put that I averaged down yesterday. I did attempt to close it EOD yesterday but it didn\u2019t fill missed it by about 10 cents\u2026 I was already down over 50% at EOD yesterday. I was able to closer it at open before the IV crush for -84.3%. Overall im still at 1.5x weekly profits with that loss. \n\nI am continuing to capitalize on quick scalps using the 1min/ 5min HA candles with STOCH and VOLD/VOLSPD 1min HA candles. The 20/50emas here have been gold for me. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r4rprh1w7yg91.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc5d4a6ac354ff3ab23eb5e50de0ddae975a9e8f\n\nAim small miss small. I am currently 9 for 9 on plays this week and my only red play is that swing play that I opened last week. Overall its been a great week. \n\nToday was a tough one to trade because we had such extreme bull momentum, however, the candles were moving at snail pace all day. Going to be interesting to see what tomorrow brings. \n\nOn one hand this feels like the bulls are exhausted and gives me May FOMC vibes where she dumped like a mofo the next day and on the other hand this felt like a premarket run followed by consolidation all day. EOD I saw some crazy buying coming in on VOLSPD and VOLD. Very organized and consistent buying, however, SPY barely budged and even sold off at the end\u2026 I wonder if we just saw a ton of shorts cover EOD. \n\nRemember in this market guys we don\u2019t need to go for homeruns. We don\u2019t need to play every single candle. A 10% win that you let turn into a -20% loser is actually a 30% loser\u2026 Be smart out here. \n\nYoutube video be up later tonight", "id": "wl8dvu", "created_utc": 1660164517.0, "score": 33,

{"title": "Random musings on what the Fed will do in Sept", "selftext": "**TLDR**: The fed has been put into a corner and will be forced to do 75bp in Sept.\n\nEver since Bernanke introduced massive QE during the aftermath of the GFC, the market has been hooked on monetary stimulus like your local crack addict. This means that any sign of a dovish pivot by the Fed to pause rates sooner or ultimately not going to 4+ % fed funds rate, is extremely bullish and also something that the bond market is already pricing in. The stock market is in a sense playing catch up to the bond market. If September FOMC is 50bp, the stock market will rally hard because it fits the bull's narrative of the Fed easing/pivoting. \n\nNow let's theorize as to what would also happen if the Fed does the expected 50bp instead of 75bp. While the 2y yields may go up, the 10y bond yields will go down. Yes, not up. They will go down because just like stocks, the 10y is forward-looking too and sees the pivot in play. Unlike short maturities, the 10y is less influenced by the Fed's actions and this is why we have an inverted yield curve. The 10y yield is very important because it influences mortgage rates. And lower mortgage rates mean more home demand and thus home prices going back up. Because the stock market will also rally, the so-called \"wealth effect\" will in theory trickle down to consumers' spending habits.  This then leads to commodities going back up again. As you can see, it kind of sets up a trap for inflation to come back again hard. This is why the Fed can't just back off from a couple of decent CPI prints.\n\nI really think the market is mispricing what the Fed will do. The Fed likes to telegraph in advance to the market as to what it plans to do so that it doesn't cause any nasty surprises. You have had multiple Fed governors in recent weeks all confirming that the Fed is no where near pausing. You even had one that said she supports 75bp to be on the table. Their tone has been steadfast in spite of improving data. But the market has been ignoring all this. The market is no longer respecting the Fed and seemingly will continue to \"fight it\".\n\nThe fed has potential next month to lose all credibility, and pull an Arther Burns instead of a Volker.\n\nI think the Fed will be forced to do 75bp in Sept and it will catch the market off guard, causing a nasty pullback.", "id": "wlc1ab", "created_utc": 1660173785.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|3 years ago\n**Total Comments**|599|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wlc1ab)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wlc1ab)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.048295821994543076}, {"body": "If the fed is really concerned about the 10YUST lagging it should communicate its intent to keep rates higher for a longer period.
