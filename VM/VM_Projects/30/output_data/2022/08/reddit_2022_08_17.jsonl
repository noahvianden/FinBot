{"title": "8-17-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Today was FOMC minutes\u2026 what did we learn? Well not a whole lot that we didn\u2019t already know\u2026 essentially feds are once again telling us there are not going to stop rate hikes and most likely we will see a 75bps hike rate in September\u2026 however, markets are still pricing in a 50bps hike\u2026 so markets still fail to believe the feds path. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g9eofaxz1ci91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c79c66ba773ca54b937e82f6791fbdf19ddd4bae\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rtlnl2i02ci91.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ef501d8ff3b442f6011381f10128e380622804a\n\nPerfect play for FOMC minute today I called out for you guys. I saw a lot of people take these trades and kill it today. Proud of each and every person who made killer gains today. \n\nI had a great day two green trades.. no complaints. However, I continue to mental block myself on these big fed days and big moves. In my mind I know that xyz is going to happen cause of historical and I pretty much call it out to the penny sometimes (called the initial 428.5 rejection at 2pm) but I continue to be in a mental block in this market. I had a while where I was going for too many homeruns and I was anticipating too much from this market and got burnt\u2026 I got to a happy place taking my 10% scalps and now im very hesitant going for some of these homerun plays. The more im right the more I trust the analysis. I look forward to actual FOMC in September as that\u2019s usually a killer play. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u8twje312ci91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4841f26e4f4c136eb93a414ce5644e1fb50ae74a\n\nToday was the first day in months that we saw extreme bear momentum maintained almost all day. The issue with the bear momentum is that when we have bull momentum the candles just rip green all day long, however, today we watched with selling volume increasing and at its extreme momentum that SPY continue to trend green for almost 2 hours straight. When we have an extreme like that we should not see the trend inverse it like we saw today\u2026 it was one of the reasons I didn\u2019t take the call play myself as I wasn\u2019t sure if markets were setting up for a massive dump with the fake rally against momentum. \n\nSpy today rejected that 429.7 daily resistance level again and failed to reachout for the bear market resistance level. Overall we closed out with another gravestone doji. However, you can see that the last few times we have done this while it should dump the next day and be a sort of \u201ctop\u201d it actually has signaled a bottom. \n\nWe are still riding within the red rising wedge. \n\nKey support- \n\n425.9 (red rising wedge support) -> 422.9 (daily 8ema)\n\nKey resistance-\n\n427.3 -> 429.8 (daily resistance level)\n\nIf I see a support test of 425.9 in the morning that holds I will be looking to play some calls without a doubt, however, if we break through this level I will look for puts and a bigger sell off continuation tomorrow. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9h80nwo12ci91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f44783c901f926eb421f147903571b376694979\n\nFutures has a more convincing top with that doji from yesterday that formed a double top today. \n\nKey support-\n\n4280 -> 4255 -> 4240 (red rising wedge support)\n\nKey resistance-\n\n4308 -> 4330 (bear market resistance)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uyx21ie22ci91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=10e76bee3598c356619f814d9b0644bb34e2f630\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8h2fbz22ci91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=686bd9ef4c018759c555de8833022e83eca22a13\n\nI am growing more and more convinced the SPY and ES weeklies are putting in the top weekly candle right now\u2026 both are formed with gravestone dojis. \n\nKey resistance remains at 432.8/ 4340. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wvo5cy862ci91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=952867709c83fea66f413cbd9bb1cd704a341d11\n\nThen we have our problem child Apple\u2026 We saw apple BREAK through the bear market resistance line\u2026 effectively apple just broke the 2022 trend of no higher highs\u2026 however, we saw a pretty strong rejection there and the candle body closed AT the resistance of 174.5. So what does that mean for tomorrow? Well there is a theory that sometimes we see a huge fake push through resistance and that is followed by a pretty massive dump. There is also a theory that sometimes we fail the first resistance test and then have to go for round two. \n\nWhich one will it be? We will find out tomorrow and Friday. \n\nAll eyes on 174.5 tomorrow for Apple\u2026 if we hold under that level and especially if we see a bigger sell off back to 173.3 range tomorrow then I am thinking today just put the top in. Again im not getting excited as we finally saw a nicer red day for SPY but apple closed super green\u2026 Apple closing at 0.88% green while spy closed 0.71% red doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense\u2026 especially when the rest of tech was pretty bloody too. \n\nKey support-\n\n173.3\n\nKey resistance\n\n174.5\n\nIf we break out and close over 175 tomorrow im looking at apple making an ATH next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zdaqhov62ci91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=53a3d5c8c66ee3e7cd3d342d5c2e3b6ceb76f9b4\n\nThe VIX continues to trend for the 6th day in a row now near this 19.5 to 20.5 range failing to break down or out from here\u2026 I still am waiting for that VIX breakout towards 22-23 before I get into long term puts\u2026 we are close but not there yet. The top is getting closer but its not there yet. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/svmbpge72ci91.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0fa003df0b2b9136f251bc0f695d53c6971bffc\n\nSurface level\u2026 I had a great day today\u2026 couldn\u2019t be any happier with my day trading today and this week\u2026 8 for 8 this week. Cant beat that right? \n\nBut when I look at the volatility of today and the fact that I could have made 100-200% gains easily today and that I had plans to but failed to execute does hurt a little. The day played out nearly perfectly for what I expected. \n\nSometimes I get in my own head and I look at too much information and I talk myself out of a high risk to reward play because of one indicator. I am still learning that I can trust myself again in this market\u2026 those June to July months where everything look perfect and then we would see a massive 1% reversal out of no where still haunt me. \n\nBut ignoring FOMC minute play\u2026 this week has been great for me\u2026 Thursdays have been my downfall the last 2 weeks and I look forward to changing that tomorrow.\n\nRemember to be patient guys and let the play come to you. \n\nYoutube be up later.", "id": "wqz5or", "created_utc": 1660767934.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 39, "comments": [{"body":
