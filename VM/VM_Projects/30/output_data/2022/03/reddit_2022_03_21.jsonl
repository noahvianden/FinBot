You get the best of both worlds. t401k gives you tax break now allowing you to invest more and allows you to get the free match if available, but in my mind the chances of taxes being higher in this country 20+ years from now are very high. The Roth IRA lets you control your own investments if you want to do individual stocks or options too and you will not have to worry about any taxes moving forward. It also is more flexible because you can withdraw any contributions you've made into it tax free if you really absolutely had to for some reason. Also it has no required minimum distributions, meaning if you could live off the 401k and want to just let the rIRA snowball keep rolling uninterrupted you can, it's up to you and your needs.

I can then borrow the remaining 6k at lets say 9% margin for this example. The monthly margin cost would be around $45. I know that the options will be prices differently but I will use the current 30 delta calls which are priced at $17.40 and then divided by 20= $87 per week.

Real Estate and allied sectors forms 30% of its GDP. And property sales have been tumbling 35% plus for past two months year on year. The debt burden is still high for many property developers and debt market is frozen for most of them with even the best trading at 65 cents to a dollar. It also got dragged in Ukraine Russia conflict trying to pacify Russia while keeping its trade relations with the west intact and given that it has its own geo political ambitions with respect to South China sea and Taiwan in particular, it will be closely watched for its actions.
