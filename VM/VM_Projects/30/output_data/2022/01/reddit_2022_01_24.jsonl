If you got VIX calls out to late feb/march hold them, if you got puts that expire a couple of days, i would take profit and wait for a better entry in the next 24-48 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jk4bdizvlnd81.png?width=2227&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b5dbc7ee167ff1999da74006be368a6591ead62\n\nStrap your crash helmet on, because we are getting to VIX 80 in the next 2 weeks here and VIX 150 in the next month\n\n**Update 11:45am:** looks like maybe we go down lower, not even a small bounce, the liquidation from the large players must be intense, its even overwhelming the lunch algos.\n\n**Update: 2:25pm:** looks like the bounce was from 4120 to 4240, 120 bps jump. I screwed up by forgetting VIX is standard deviation and moves are variance, should've used 1.7\\^2 \\* 60 bps and we would get 180 bps bounce. Oh well. Retace of the VIX and SPX is probably done now and we go to VIX 60 in the next few days.\n\n**Update: 4:00 pm:** Huge volatile action today gave us a good idea of a support/resistance dynamic for the next couple of weeks. High likelihood we get a selloff towards 200 DMA of around 4420. Then a bounce wedneday afternoon as fed tweaks language to slightly less bearish, and then we go down to 3600.  Still targeting 3600 for the near term big support zone, once we hit that, we will likely bounce back up to 4200 towards mid feb before dropping off to 2000 into late feb/early march. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cd4a972eapd81.png?width=2281&format=png&auto=webp&s=384cbc7596caf428613cbb76fcc6a2b15154395e\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "sboq57", "created_utc": 1643038185.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "Why wouldn\u2019t we just find support at 4275.50?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "because of long liquidation as hedging costs explode.

{"title": "GME will go down then up", "selftext": "As we all know, Microsoft has just recently acquired Activision for $69 Billion USD.  This new asset now brings to multiple game studios with some HUGE franchise names to the Xbox team.  There is speculation that new games from these franchises will become console exclusive to Xbox.  Here is a current image of their current game studios they now own.  There is also the possibility that many of the new titles from these games could become Day 1 GamePass titles.  \n\nIf we take all of this news into consideration, the only bad news is for Sony fans.  They now have less game choices and less value to their consoles.  GamePass has always been an INSANE value for the price, but now with these new studios, it increased exponentially.  Which leads to my next point.\n\nMicrosoft purchases GameStop\n\nIt would be the next option to take even more money from Sony.  The new GameStop stores could be a combo of their current versions but also include more Windows/Microsoft products, or they could leave them alone for the time being to save on renovation costs.  Now that Microsoft would own a large amount of the actual games sold in a store, they would now be making money on Sony's items also.  They could always just stop selling Sony items, but that would just push the customers someplace else.  This move would mean Microsoft will profit regardless of the customer choosing Xbox or Playstation.  \n\nGamestop has had immense support in recent times.  They got Ryan Cohen to help lead them and they have plans on expanding their offerings.  With Microsoft's backing and other expertise, it could help their future plans become a successful reality.  GameStop has also Missed their Q2 and Q3 earnings which brings this even closer to a possibility.  I'm probably just losing braincells because my tinfoil hat is blocking the 5G, but I think it's the clear path for GME to go to the moon.\n\nThis pushes Sony to do something that can outweigh the positives that Microsoft has.  Sony has also raised their PS5 game prices up to $69.99 where Xbox kept them at $60.  Microsoft offers gamepass, where Sony has nothing to compete.\n\nThe only people to profit are the consumers.", "id": "sbp60k", "created_utc": 1643039393.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.45, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "Imagine being too retarded for WSB.", "score": 23, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14644549787044525}, {"body": "The hopium in this post is next level retarded", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "The OP is freebasing unadulterated medical-grade hopium fresh from the Golden Triangle.", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48599952459335327}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.02306164987385273}, {"body": "Damn, it's at 90 already", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "GME is dropping like a stone, and it is so wonderful to see!

{"title": "Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered", "selftext": "Im guessing most people here (especially all you newbies that joined this sub after the GME/AMC hype) aren\u2019t feeling too hot right now. Might be time to take a break from the main floor of the casino and play the penny slots for a while. \n\nThis is only going to get worse before it gets better. Here are some of my thoughts: \n\n\n1. Interest rates rise, prices fall. Interest rates are poised to rise 4 times this year and the fed can\u2019t afford not to raise rate due to inflation. \n\n2. Inflation. They can\u2019t run the money printer forever and if the fed wants to reign this in, they will need to continue to raise interest rates. \n\n3. Mortgage debt. How many people do you know that bought a house in the past year or 2? This past summer saw an intense buying spree with people offering $100k+ over asking in some areas. Real estate was also propped up by the iBuyers (which are now taking massive losses). Also see point 1.\n\n4. Student debt. Good \u2018ol uncle campaigned on erasing at least some student loans, but has since reversed course and it looks like payments could legitimately resume in May. If those same people that haven\u2019t been paying their student loans have also been buying homes at the top range of allowable DTI levels, then you might see some folks attempting to downsize. Those folks might come to the unflattering realization that they aren\u2019t able to sell their homes for the same ridiculous prices they paid over this past summer. \n\n5. Covid/supply chain issues - nothing new here, but certainly compounds the issues above\n\n6. China / Evergrande - if you haven\u2019t heard of Evergrande, it\u2019s a massive real estate company in China that is defaulting on hundreds of billions of dollars of debt. This is going to send shockwaves through China and beyond. \n\n7. Other speculative investments - there is another very active community on Reddit that shall not be named that is also seeing massive losses. \n\n\n\nTLDR: Gay bear szn \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b", "id": "sbtjvr", "created_utc": 1643050785.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "I read... stonks are on sale buy more.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "\\*blindly buys more AMC", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2604941129684448}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16200855374336243}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "These post after the fact are quite annoying.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1774689257144928}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.02007938362658024}, {"body": "Buy the dip, you fools.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "What happens when the dip starts dipping?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "You keep buying, right?", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08269363641738892}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46452271938323975}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3873530328273773}, {"body": "People who pick bottoms get stinky fingers", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.022300392389297485}, {"body": "Until real estate solves their supply problem, prices won't budge.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5506253838539124}, {"body": "Who has money to buy a over inflated house or pay student loans when GME is on sale? its like buy one get one free!", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "People and funds who own most real estate with cash offers since \u201809.

Given our 1.7x multiplier based on how high we are relative to that top, i think we will get a 80-90 points rise from the low of \\~4270. Expect a dead cat bounce up to about 4350-70, this is a perfect place to add to some 2/4 SPX puts in the 4000 range. If you got VIX calls out to late feb/march hold them, if you got puts that expire a couple of days, i would take profit and wait for a better entry in the next 24-48 hours.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jk4bdizvlnd81.png?width=2227&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b5dbc7ee167ff1999da74006be368a6591ead62\n\nStrap your crash helmet on, because we are getting to VIX 80 in the next 2 weeks here and VIX 150 in the next month\n\n**Update 11:45am:** looks like maybe we go down lower, not even a small bounce, the liquidation from the large players must be intense, its even overwhelming the lunch algos.\n\n**Update: 2:25pm:** looks like the bounce was from 4120 to 4240, 120 bps jump. I screwed up by forgetting VIX is standard deviation and moves are variance, should've used 1.7\\^2 \\* 60 bps and we would get 180 bps bounce. Oh well. Retace of the VIX and SPX is probably done now and we go to VIX 60 in the next few days.\n\n**Update: 4:00 pm:** Huge volatile action today gave us a good idea of a support/resistance dynamic for the next couple of weeks. High likelihood we get a selloff towards 200 DMA of around 4420. Then a bounce wedneday afternoon as fed tweaks language to slightly less bearish, and then we go down to 3600.  Still targeting 3600 for the near term big support zone, once we hit that, we will likely bounce back up to 4200 towards mid feb before dropping off to 2000 into late feb/early march. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cd4a972eapd81.png?width=2281&format=png&auto=webp&s=384cbc7596caf428613cbb76fcc6a2b15154395e\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "sboq57", "created_utc": 1643038185.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "Why wouldn\u2019t we just find support at 4275.50?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "because of long liquidation as hedging costs explode.

{"title": "GME will go down then up", "selftext": "As we all know, Microsoft has just recently acquired Activision for $69 Billion USD.  This new asset now brings to multiple game studios with some HUGE franchise names to the Xbox team.  There is speculation that new games from these franchises will become console exclusive to Xbox.  Here is a current image of their current game studios they now own.  There is also the possibility that many of the new titles from these games could become Day 1 GamePass titles.  \n\nIf we take all of this news into consideration, the only bad news is for Sony fans.  They now have less game choices and less value to their consoles.  GamePass has always been an INSANE value for the price, but now with these new studios, it increased exponentially.  Which leads to my next point.\n\nMicrosoft purchases GameStop\n\nIt would be the next option to take even more money from Sony.  The new GameStop stores could be a combo of their current versions but also include more Windows/Microsoft products, or they could leave them alone for the time being to save on renovation costs.  Now that Microsoft would own a large amount of the actual games sold in a store, they would now be making money on Sony's items also.  They could always just stop selling Sony items, but that would just push the customers someplace else.  This move would mean Microsoft will profit regardless of the customer choosing Xbox or Playstation.  \n\nGamestop has had immense support in recent times.  They got Ryan Cohen to help lead them and they have plans on expanding their offerings.  With Microsoft's backing and other expertise, it could help their future plans become a successful reality.  GameStop has also Missed their Q2 and Q3 earnings which brings this even closer to a possibility.  I'm probably just losing braincells because my tinfoil hat is blocking the 5G, but I think it's the clear path for GME to go to the moon.\n\nThis pushes Sony to do something that can outweigh the positives that Microsoft has.  Sony has also raised their PS5 game prices up to $69.99 where Xbox kept them at $60.  Microsoft offers gamepass, where Sony has nothing to compete.\n\nThe only people to profit are the consumers.", "id": "sbp60k", "created_utc": 1643039393.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.45, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "Imagine being too retarded for WSB.", "score": 23, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14644549787044525}, {"body": "The hopium in this post is next level retarded", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "The OP is freebasing unadulterated medical-grade hopium fresh from the Golden Triangle.", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.48599952459335327}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.02306164987385273}, {"body": "Damn, it's at 90 already", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "GME is dropping like a stone, and it is so wonderful to see!

{"title": "Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered", "selftext": "Im guessing most people here (especially all you newbies that joined this sub after the GME/AMC hype) aren\u2019t feeling too hot right now. Might be time to take a break from the main floor of the casino and play the penny slots for a while. \n\nThis is only going to get worse before it gets better. Here are some of my thoughts: \n\n\n1. Interest rates rise, prices fall. Interest rates are poised to rise 4 times this year and the fed can\u2019t afford not to raise rate due to inflation. \n\n2. Inflation. They can\u2019t run the money printer forever and if the fed wants to reign this in, they will need to continue to raise interest rates. \n\n3. Mortgage debt. How many people do you know that bought a house in the past year or 2? This past summer saw an intense buying spree with people offering $100k+ over asking in some areas. Real estate was also propped up by the iBuyers (which are now taking massive losses). Also see point 1.\n\n4. Student debt. Good \u2018ol uncle campaigned on erasing at least some student loans, but has since reversed course and it looks like payments could legitimately resume in May. If those same people that haven\u2019t been paying their student loans have also been buying homes at the top range of allowable DTI levels, then you might see some folks attempting to downsize. Those folks might come to the unflattering realization that they aren\u2019t able to sell their homes for the same ridiculous prices they paid over this past summer. \n\n5. Covid/supply chain issues - nothing new here, but certainly compounds the issues above\n\n6. China / Evergrande - if you haven\u2019t heard of Evergrande, it\u2019s a massive real estate company in China that is defaulting on hundreds of billions of dollars of debt. This is going to send shockwaves through China and beyond. \n\n7.
