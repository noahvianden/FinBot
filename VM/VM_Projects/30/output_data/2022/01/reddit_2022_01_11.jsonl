{"title": "What are the best growth ETFs to invest in right now?", "selftext": "I am looking to add to quality growth. \nGrowth stocks have been selling off driven by interest rates. It make sense; 100-200bp higher interest rate can cut valuations by 30-40%. \nI do feel like this sell of is overdone as this rate increase has already been over-publicized. People started talking about tightening this time last year. So by the time the raises actually come, it will be time to buy. \nAmong growth ETFs - which ones look interesting ?\n\nARKK - actively managed innovation fund\n(+) i like the fact that it is actively managed. Not sure about the positions it holds. \n(-) Don\u2019t love consumer tech stocks here - seems like they got a pretty big boost from covid and that boat has sailed. Eg. ZOOM, SQ \u2026 could bounce from lows but is that what I want to hold long term? Prob ok for a bounce. Here is a link to all the holdings: https://ark-funds.com/funds/arkk/\n\nQQQ - passive - holds the largest 100 (non-financial) tech stocks trading on nasdaq \n(+) I like the risk/reward compared to ARKK - when things go well QQQ performs well but when they don\u2019t doesn\u2019t completely implode \n(-) Seems like FANG is the entire index (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, Alphabet and Facebook make up 40+ % of the index). May be ok - fits quality growth, but not sure broad growth exposure will do great in raising interest rate environment long term. Prob ok for a bounce trade. \nLink to holdings: https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html\n\nSPRX active and invests in industrial technology - mix of growth like NVDA, TER, Cybersecurity (ZS & PANW) and some value FCX, TDG, IR\n(+) like the picks and the research\n(-) seems new \nLink to holdings: https://spear-funds.com/index2.php\n\nThan there is SOXX, CLOU, META etc that focus on specific themes. But seem way to volatile and the holdings many times have vague connections to the themes or the themes have played out. \n\nAny good ones that I am missing ?", "id": "s12imu", "created_utc": 1641870298.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor stock recommendations please see our portfolio sticky, sort by hot, it's the first sticky, or see [past portfolio stickies here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22Rate+My+Portfolio%22+-+r%2FStocks+Quarterly+Thread&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all)\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Convexity is high here. Yeah you'll make money a lot of the times but when you lose money you'll lose a lot!\n\n- **Short IV on things with persistently high IV and do so close to the money.** [TSLA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA) is the classic example, [GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME) is another favorite, and [AMC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC) is [another one that you can do](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/nqy5nk/im_dumb_and_feel_so_hopeless_never_sell_naked/). You'll make money for a while (\ud83e\udd2e) but if you don't walk away you'll get crushed. Don't sell those 50 puts though, you'll make some money doing so. Biotech is great for this because while it has a lot of IV you can collect, it also has random 80% drops or 10x gains in the underlying. The best part is they tend to use the \"news pending\" halt so that you'll have a reduced ability to get out.\n\n- **Don't delta hedge.** If you are selling a straddle or strangle, make sure you're exposed in as many ways as possible. If you delta hedge, you'll lower your exposure to the underlying's movement. If you are selling [SPX](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec) options, do not hedge with [/ES](https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500-futures) contracts.\n\n- **Persistently short index IV, even as IV drops lower and lower.** Why sell at VIX 30 when you can sell at VIX 10? [If you're lucky you'll even get an event where VIX doubles in a day](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-06/the-day-the-vix-doubled-tales-of-volmageddon), blowing out your nice short vol position.\n\n- **Sell options right before known market moving events.** BLS releases the [Consumer Price Index](https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/cpi.htm) every month. The [Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm) also has meetings every month or two. There are also plenty of other economic factors that [don't matter until they do](https://readthehedge.com/2020/05/11/market-soars-plummets-reflecting-fears-excitement-over-single-macroeconomic-factor/). If you're selling index options, make sure you're positioned so that you're exposed to any violent shifts in the major stock indexes, which are bound to happen after such an event.\n\n- **Cross the spread/submit market orders.** Citadel is probably the one sitting on the bid and ask, not some WSB person who also crossed the spread to buy a $0.03 lottery ticket. If you submit a market order you can also sometimes hit stub quotes which can significantly decrease your likeliness of profit.\n\n- **Choose illiquid underlyings and contracts if at all possible.** Leveraged ETPs, biotechs no one has heard of, etc are a few examples. If you can, sell nonstandard options and sell weeklies instead of monthlies or quarterlies.

{"title": "My TSLA Investment Thesis", "selftext": "Sharing my general investment thesis because I think looking at history gives a unique perspective that many people glance past when they\u2019re diving deep into the weeds. For this example I am going to completely ignore financial analysis and look at the things which are more difficult to quantify. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Introduction** \n\nI know that many bulls agree that Tesla will be the biggest stock and most disruptive company of all time so let\u2019s take a peek at the most recent example. I believe that Tesla is in a similar position today to where Apple was about 2-3yr after they released the iPhone (10-12yr ago).\n\nBefore we go comparing apples to oranges I\u2019d like to argue that I believe they are really the same as they both disrupted established industries by using a strategy of combining great hardware with software expertise to reinvent an existing product.\n\nApple released the iPhone in 2007 into a crowded market filled with various cellphones which were sold by established competitors yet the products were mostly garbage. There was tremendous FUD by mainstream media and various hit-pieces about why Apple won\u2019t stand a chance against the existing competition and how consumers won\u2019t want a phone with a touchscreen etc. [https://macdailynews.com/2007/01/10/the\\_massive\\_fud\\_campaign\\_against\\_apples\\_iphone/](https://macdailynews.com/2007/01/10/the_massive_fud_campaign_against_apples_iphone/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Competition is Coming**\n\nIn 2008 as the iPhone slowly gained popularity we began to see a shift from competitors where they decided to make smartphones to compete against Apple. The news rang loudly that they would catch up soon and crush Apple. Here is a slideshow deck from a quarterly earnings presentation by Nokia. [http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia4.png](http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia4.png) \n\nWe can see that they decided instead of using the Apple strategy of focusing all energy into making one really great product with high-margins they\u2019d rather make a bunch of mediocre products with low-margins. GM is currently using a very similar strategy by promising to make 30 new EV models when they still haven\u2019t perfected a single one yet. \n\nIn 2009 Tim (COO at the time) is interviewed about how there is a ton of competition coming with dozens of new phones coming out to catch up to them. His response is that \u201cThey\u2019re still catching up with the first iPhone we\u2019ve moved beyond that\u201d. This is a very clear similarity of how the pace of innovation is what truly matters and that Tesla is in a similar point where competitors are trying to catch up with the original Model 3 while Tesla has moved far beyond that point in terms of product development for future releases. [https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/19/apple-on-its-iphone-competitors-theyre-still-catching-up-to-the-first-iphone/](https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/19/apple-on-its-iphone-competitors-theyre-still-catching-up-to-the-first-iphone/) \n\nAnother year or so goes by and the industry realizes that Apple isn\u2019t just in the phone business but that they are also in the software business. They adjust their strategy with a reactive instead of proactive approach again to continue playing catchup. Notice that they finally included a touchscreen after claiming nobody wants one, and also attempted to do music/apps/etc. [http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia10.png](http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia10.png) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A Cult of Personality**\n\nIn terms of the product ecosystem Apple has been noted as having a cult following of people who evangelize their products. This cult of personality has also rippled from their notably eccentric CEO Steve Jobs throughout pop-culture and through their retail investor community. We know that Wall Street hates unpredictability and likes things which are easy to analyze and fit into a certain category. \n\nTesla clearly mirrors this wild cult-like behavior from top to bottom, and arguably to an even greater extreme given Musk\u2019s social media behavior. Both of these companies have been known for being the red-headed stepchild of Wall Street due to always thinking and behaving outside the box.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A Tale of Two Boomers** \n\nMany people say hindsight is usually 20/20 however I\u2019d like to offer unique example of attempting to hone the skill of foresight. To present this I will offer a tale of two boomers I\u2019m fortunate enough to know, followed up by a personal experience of mine.\n\nMeet Bob, he\u2019s your average late 50\u2019s guy that likes to watch CNBC and talks about movement in the DOW in terms of points instead of percentages. One of the coolest family members of mine, great guy with an interesting story. \n\nBob purchased $AAPL in 1993 for around $14 ($0.31 split adjusted) and sold it around 6 months later for $19 per share ($0.42 split adjusted) which was a modest gain for holding under a year. Obviously we can see that if he would have just held he\u2019d be laughing all the way to the bank. However he is your average retail investor that buys random stock in random companies he doesn\u2019t fully understand and hasn\u2019t ever done enough research to develop the conviction to hodl.\n\nMeet Mike, he\u2019s your average late 50\u2019s guy that likes to play guitar and go fishing. His first job out of college in the early 1980\u2019s would fly him around for work and he randomly got upgraded to first class free one day on a nearly empty flight heading from San Francisco to LA. He struck up conversation with two guys named Steve and Steve who thought he may have been wealthy since he was in first class and tried to pitch him on investing in their computer company named after a fruit. Yes that\u2019s right it was Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak\u2026 He politely declined as he was broke and just recently graduated from college, yet reminisces of the pleasant conversation they had that day.\n\nSeveral years later he ended up getting an Apple IIC desktop computer and reflected on his conversation on that flight while he enjoyed using his new computer at work. Over the next few years he began to slowly pick up a few shares of Apple stock as he could afford to but he never had a huge disposable income as he was raising a family and working an average job. Over the next 10yrs through the ups and downs he continued slowly buying because he kept enjoying their new products. Many years have since gone by and his small position has grown into a sizable one which enabled him to achieve waterfront living in South Florida and early retirement. \n\nAbout 2 years ago Mike purchased a Tesla Model 3 Performance and when I asked him how he liked it he instantly began raving about how amazing it is. He also mentioned how it reminded him of when he got his Apple IIC back in the day. Mike even stated to me that he believes Tesla is on a similar path to the one Apple took and that he began converting some of his AAPL holding to begin accumulating TSLA after he got acquainted with the product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BTC**\n\nI\u2019ve always been into computers and began mining this thing called Bitcoin while in college during 2014 which cost about $300 at the time. Over the next three years I accumulated a decent quantity of them. In 2017 the price began to rise significantly and I sold most of them for around $1500-$2500/btc for what I thought was a huge gain. The price continued to climb and I sold the remainder around $5000/btc as I never expected it was possible to achieve that price without being a massive bubble. \n\nI was very excited about my returns but I continued to watch the price continue climbing over the coming years and was too nervous to ever fully jump back in. Hindsight is a bitch sometimes but that\u2019s how you learn that things can continue to surprise you far beyond your wildest expectations especially when there is no existing framework for the disruptive technology in question.  \n\nThis example led me to get a taste of what Bob must feel like, and I am now attempting to hone my foresight so that I can achieve what Mike did. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMany people have done great work here on DCF models and attempting to value Tesla, but I believe that other factors are hard to forecast when looking further past a 5 year time horizon. I think that things will continue to surprise people and disruptive innovation is extremely difficult to quantify. \n\nMy general thesis is that TSLA = AAPL but with a much larger TAM, curious to see how things play out :)", "id": "s1eq7j", "created_utc": 1641912885.0, "score": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "Bro post this to WSB", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I think this contains too many words for the average user there", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "So it just may work\u2026\n\nIn all honesty the mods are trying to promote proper DDs there now. \n\nI\u2019m happy to post it if you want, I get good traction there", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Sure I\u2019m up to give that a whirl, will the BTC word still get it blocked? \n\nAlso will probably revise/add a few things such as:\n\n- EV revolution is inevitable \n\n- links to GM strategy slides\n\n- people trying to find the next TSLA when it\u2019s right in front of them\n\n- maybe links to other resources to dive deeper on the numbers \n\nAny input from anyone on here is appreciated", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Yes absolutely you need to remove crypto mentions or it gets auto locked. \n\nYou\u2019ll need a funny subject, u/IS_JOKE_COMRADE is the best for suggestions.

And almost no one saw that smartphone would become the default internet device in most of the world. But that pattern started to become clearer and clearer as time went on, and the prediction that almost everyone on earth would have a smartphone became obvious.\n\nBut there's not really any limitations to smartphone manufacturing. As more companies got in to the business prices dropped while features and specs improved. The cost of all the important parts (batteries, screens, CPUs, etc.) dropped as volumes went up, and if you wanted to make any money you had to rely on branding or building some kind of ecosystem. Those are both things Apple did well and in some years they captured over 100% of all smartphone profits since the rest of the industry lost money on average.\n\nI suspect that in many ways we'll see a similar story play out with EVs. Most people are probably underestimating the rate at which EVs will replace petrol cars. Cars have a much longer useful life than phones, so the rate at which the installed base changes will be slower, but I suspect the demand for new EVs will be way above production capacity for a long time. And that's not even taking in to account that many countries and state/provinces around the world are talking about outlawing the sale of new petrol cars in the next 10-15 years.\n\nBut EVs aren't smartphones. They're much more expensive, much more complicated with wayyyy more parts. And importantly they all rely on lithium ion cell production. Smartphones were never limited by how many batteries could be made because they needed such small batteries. But EVs will likely be limited by battery cell supply for many years to come.\n\nAs the world switches from 100% petrol to 100% EV over the next couple decades, a company's success in that market will be largely determined by their battery supply. If they can secure a consistently growing supply of cells, at reasonable prices, they'll probably be able to be competitive and maybe profitable. But to be really successful I think an auto manufacturer would need to also be in the cell production business (in the same way that all auto companies manufactured their own engines, that was one part that was almost never outsourced to a supplier, it was just too important). And if you want high volumes and decent profit margins, a manufacturer will probably have to be vertically integrated and either be directly securing a supply of minerals for cell production, or actually be involved in mining and refining in some ways.\n\nAny company that's not currently securing a supply of materials and cell production to be able to make millions of EVs in the next few years is going to be at a huge disadvantage. It would be like if Apple not only had the best brand in smartphones, but manufactured all their own phones, and most of the parts and was also the worlds largest supplier of touchscreens.", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Great post.

It make sense; 100-200bp higher interest rate can cut valuations by 30-40%. \nI do feel like this sell of is overdone as this rate increase has already been over-publicized.

ZOOM, SQ \u2026 could bounce from lows but is that what I want to hold long term? Prob ok for a bounce. Here is a link to all the holdings: https://ark-funds.com/funds/arkk/\n\nQQQ - passive - holds the largest 100 (non-financial) tech stocks trading on nasdaq \n(+) I like the risk/reward compared to ARKK - when things go well QQQ performs well but when they don\u2019t doesn\u2019t completely implode \n(-) Seems like FANG is the entire index (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, Alphabet and Facebook make up 40+ % of the index). May be ok - fits quality growth, but not sure broad growth exposure will do great in raising interest rate environment long term. Prob ok for a bounce trade. \nLink to holdings: https://www.invesco.com/qqq-etf/en/about.html\n\nSPRX active and invests in industrial technology - mix of growth like NVDA, TER, Cybersecurity (ZS & PANW) and some value FCX, TDG, IR\n(+) like the picks and the research\n(-) seems new \nLink to holdings: https://spear-funds.com/index2.php\n\nThan there is SOXX, CLOU, META etc that focus on specific themes.

Convexity is high here. Yeah you'll make money a lot of the times but when you lose money you'll lose a lot!\n\n- **Short IV on things with persistently high IV and do so close to the money.** [TSLA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA) is the classic example, [GME](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GME) is another favorite, and [AMC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMC) is [another one that you can do](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/nqy5nk/im_dumb_and_feel_so_hopeless_never_sell_naked/). You'll make money for a while (\ud83e\udd2e) but if you don't walk away you'll get crushed. Don't sell those 50 puts though, you'll make some money doing so. Biotech is great for this because while it has a lot of IV you can collect, it also has random 80% drops or 10x gains in the underlying. The best part is they tend to use the \"news pending\" halt so that you'll have a reduced ability to get out.\n\n- **Don't delta hedge.** If you are selling a straddle or strangle, make sure you're exposed in as many ways as possible. If you delta hedge, you'll lower your exposure to the underlying's movement. If you are selling [SPX](https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec) options, do not hedge with [/ES](https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500-futures) contracts.\n\n- **Persistently short index IV, even as IV drops lower and lower.** Why sell at VIX 30 when you can sell at VIX 10? [If you're lucky you'll even get an event where VIX doubles in a day](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-06/the-day-the-vix-doubled-tales-of-volmageddon), blowing out your nice short vol position.\n\n- **Sell options right before known market moving events.** BLS releases the [Consumer Price Index](https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/cpi.htm) every month. The [Federal Market Open Committee (FOMC)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm) also has meetings every month or two. There are also plenty of other economic factors that [don't matter until they do](https://readthehedge.com/2020/05/11/market-soars-plummets-reflecting-fears-excitement-over-single-macroeconomic-factor/). If you're selling index options, make sure you're positioned so that you're exposed to any violent shifts in the major stock indexes, which are bound to happen after such an event.\n\n- **Cross the spread/submit market orders.** Citadel is probably the one sitting on the bid and ask, not some WSB person who also crossed the spread to buy a $0.03 lottery ticket. If you submit a market order you can also sometimes hit stub quotes which can significantly decrease your likeliness of profit.\n\n- **Choose illiquid underlyings and contracts if at all possible.** Leveraged ETPs, biotechs no one has heard of, etc are a few examples. If you can, sell nonstandard options and sell weeklies instead of monthlies or quarterlies. Sell 10 SPY contracts instead of 1 SPX contract, as you can donate to your broker straight off the bat, plus SPY is less liquid than SPX (albeit slightly). You also want to use as many legs as possible. Why sell 2 options when you can sell 4 or 6?

I believe that Tesla is in a similar position today to where Apple was about 2-3yr after they released the iPhone (10-12yr ago).\n\nBefore we go comparing apples to oranges I\u2019d like to argue that I believe they are really the same as they both disrupted established industries by using a strategy of combining great hardware with software expertise to reinvent an existing product.\n\nApple released the iPhone in 2007 into a crowded market filled with various cellphones which were sold by established competitors yet the products were mostly garbage. There was tremendous FUD by mainstream media and various hit-pieces about why Apple won\u2019t stand a chance against the existing competition and how consumers won\u2019t want a phone with a touchscreen etc. [https://macdailynews.com/2007/01/10/the\\_massive\\_fud\\_campaign\\_against\\_apples\\_iphone/](https://macdailynews.com/2007/01/10/the_massive_fud_campaign_against_apples_iphone/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Competition is Coming**\n\nIn 2008 as the iPhone slowly gained popularity we began to see a shift from competitors where they decided to make smartphones to compete against Apple. The news rang loudly that they would catch up soon and crush Apple. Here is a slideshow deck from a quarterly earnings presentation by Nokia. [http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia4.png](http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia4.png) \n\nWe can see that they decided instead of using the Apple strategy of focusing all energy into making one really great product with high-margins they\u2019d rather make a bunch of mediocre products with low-margins. GM is currently using a very similar strategy by promising to make 30 new EV models when they still haven\u2019t perfected a single one yet. \n\nIn 2009 Tim (COO at the time) is interviewed about how there is a ton of competition coming with dozens of new phones coming out to catch up to them. His response is that \u201cThey\u2019re still catching up with the first iPhone we\u2019ve moved beyond that\u201d. This is a very clear similarity of how the pace of innovation is what truly matters and that Tesla is in a similar point where competitors are trying to catch up with the original Model 3 while Tesla has moved far beyond that point in terms of product development for future releases. [https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/19/apple-on-its-iphone-competitors-theyre-still-catching-up-to-the-first-iphone/](https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/19/apple-on-its-iphone-competitors-theyre-still-catching-up-to-the-first-iphone/) \n\nAnother year or so goes by and the industry realizes that Apple isn\u2019t just in the phone business but that they are also in the software business. They adjust their strategy with a reactive instead of proactive approach again to continue playing catchup. Notice that they finally included a touchscreen after claiming nobody wants one, and also attempted to do music/apps/etc. [http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia10.png](http://disruptiveinnovation.se/wp-content/uploads/Nokia10.png) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A Cult of Personality**\n\nIn terms of the product ecosystem Apple has been noted as having a cult following of people who evangelize their products. This cult of personality has also rippled from their notably eccentric CEO Steve Jobs throughout pop-culture and through their retail investor community. We know that Wall Street hates unpredictability and likes things which are easy to analyze and fit into a certain category. \n\nTesla clearly mirrors this wild cult-like behavior from top to bottom, and arguably to an even greater extreme given Musk\u2019s social media behavior. Both of these companies have been known for being the red-headed stepchild of Wall Street due to always thinking and behaving outside the box.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**A Tale of Two Boomers** \n\nMany people say hindsight is usually 20/20 however I\u2019d like to offer unique example of attempting to hone the skill of foresight. To present this I will offer a tale of two boomers I\u2019m fortunate enough to know, followed up by a personal experience of mine.\n\nMeet Bob, he\u2019s your average late 50\u2019s guy that likes to watch CNBC and talks about movement in the DOW in terms of points instead of percentages. One of the coolest family members of mine, great guy with an interesting story. \n\nBob purchased $AAPL in 1993 for around $14 ($0.31 split adjusted) and sold it around 6 months later for $19 per share ($0.42 split adjusted) which was a modest gain for holding under a year. Obviously we can see that if he would have just held he\u2019d be laughing all the way to the bank. However he is your average retail investor that buys random stock in random companies he doesn\u2019t fully understand and hasn\u2019t ever done enough research to develop the conviction to hodl.\n\nMeet Mike, he\u2019s your average late 50\u2019s guy that likes to play guitar and go fishing. His first job out of college in the early 1980\u2019s would fly him around for work and he randomly got upgraded to first class free one day on a nearly empty flight heading from San Francisco to LA. He struck up conversation with two guys named Steve and Steve who thought he may have been wealthy since he was in first class and tried to pitch him on investing in their computer company named after a fruit. Yes that\u2019s right it was Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak\u2026 He politely declined as he was broke and just recently graduated from college, yet reminisces of the pleasant conversation they had that day.\n\nSeveral years later he ended up getting an Apple IIC desktop computer and reflected on his conversation on that flight while he enjoyed using his new computer at work. Over the next few years he began to slowly pick up a few shares of Apple stock as he could afford to but he never had a huge disposable income as he was raising a family and working an average job. Over the next 10yrs through the ups and downs he continued slowly buying because he kept enjoying their new products. Many years have since gone by and his small position has grown into a sizable one which enabled him to achieve waterfront living in South Florida and early retirement. \n\nAbout 2 years ago Mike purchased a Tesla Model 3 Performance and when I asked him how he liked it he instantly began raving about how amazing it is. He also mentioned how it reminded him of when he got his Apple IIC back in the day. Mike even stated to me that he believes Tesla is on a similar path to the one Apple took and that he began converting some of his AAPL holding to begin accumulating TSLA after he got acquainted with the product.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BTC**\n\nI\u2019ve always been into computers and began mining this thing called Bitcoin while in college during 2014 which cost about $300 at the time. Over the next three years I accumulated a decent quantity of them. In 2017 the price began to rise significantly and I sold most of them for around $1500-$2500/btc for what I thought was a huge gain. The price continued to climb and I sold the remainder around $5000/btc as I never expected it was possible to achieve that price without being a massive bubble. \n\nI was very excited about my returns but I continued to watch the price continue climbing over the coming years and was too nervous to ever fully jump back in. Hindsight is a bitch sometimes but that\u2019s how you learn that things can continue to surprise you far beyond your wildest expectations especially when there is no existing framework for the disruptive technology in question.  \n\nThis example led me to get a taste of what Bob must feel like, and I am now attempting to hone my foresight so that I can achieve what Mike did. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nMany people have done great work here on DCF models and attempting to value Tesla, but I believe that other factors are hard to forecast when looking further past a 5 year time horizon. I think that things will continue to surprise people and disruptive innovation is extremely difficult to quantify. \n\nMy general thesis is that TSLA = AAPL but with a much larger TAM, curious to see how things play out :)", "id": "s1eq7j", "created_utc": 1641912885.0, "score": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "Bro post this to WSB", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I think this contains too many words for the average user there", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "So it just may work\u2026\n\nIn all honesty the mods are trying to promote proper DDs there now. \n\nI\u2019m happy to post it if you want, I get good traction there", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Sure I\u2019m up to give that a whirl, will the BTC word still get it blocked? \n\nAlso will probably revise/add a few things such as:\n\n- EV revolution is inevitable \n\n- links to GM strategy slides\n\n- people trying to find the next TSLA when it\u2019s right in front of them\n\n- maybe links to other resources to dive deeper on the numbers \n\nAny input from anyone on here is appreciated", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Yes absolutely you need to remove crypto mentions or it gets auto locked. \n\nYou\u2019ll need a funny subject, u/IS_JOKE_COMRADE is the best for suggestions.

And almost no one saw that smartphone would become the default internet device in most of the world. But that pattern started to become clearer and clearer as time went on, and the prediction that almost everyone on earth would have a smartphone became obvious.\n\nBut there's not really any limitations to smartphone manufacturing. As more companies got in to the business prices dropped while features and specs improved. The cost of all the important parts (batteries, screens, CPUs, etc.) dropped as volumes went up, and if you wanted to make any money you had to rely on branding or building some kind of ecosystem. Those are both things Apple did well and in some years they captured over 100% of all smartphone profits since the rest of the industry lost money on average.\n\nI suspect that in many ways we'll see a similar story play out with EVs. Most people are probably underestimating the rate at which EVs will replace petrol cars. Cars have a much longer useful life than phones, so the rate at which the installed base changes will be slower, but I suspect the demand for new EVs will be way above production capacity for a long time. And that's not even taking in to account that many countries and state/provinces around the world are talking about outlawing the sale of new petrol cars in the next 10-15 years.\n\nBut EVs aren't smartphones. They're much more expensive, much more complicated with wayyyy more parts. And importantly they all rely on lithium ion cell production. Smartphones were never limited by how many batteries could be made because they needed such small batteries. But EVs will likely be limited by battery cell supply for many years to come.\n\nAs the world switches from 100% petrol to 100% EV over the next couple decades, a company's success in that market will be largely determined by their battery supply. If they can secure a consistently growing supply of cells, at reasonable prices, they'll probably be able to be competitive and maybe profitable. But to be really successful I think an auto manufacturer would need to also be in the cell production business (in the same way that all auto companies manufactured their own engines, that was one part that was almost never outsourced to a supplier, it was just too important). And if you want high volumes and decent profit margins, a manufacturer will probably have to be vertically integrated and either be directly securing a supply of minerals for cell production, or actually be involved in mining and refining in some ways.\n\nAny company that's not currently securing a supply of materials and cell production to be able to make millions of EVs in the next few years is going to be at a huge disadvantage. It would be like if Apple not only had the best brand in smartphones, but manufactured all their own phones, and most of the parts and was also the worlds largest supplier of touchscreens.", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Great post.
