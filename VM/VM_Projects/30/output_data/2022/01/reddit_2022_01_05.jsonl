OPEC + maintain production plans unchanged U.S. oil closed 1.2% higher on Tuesday\n\nCaroline Bain, chief commodities analyst at Capital Economics, said that oil prices are supported by the fact that, in contrast to other new crown mutant strains, the current Omicron mutant strain has less severe symptoms and lower mortality rates in those infected, leaving the government without a widespread embargo or travel restrictions that could affect crude oil demand.\n\nOn Tuesday, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures for February delivery rose 91 cents, or 1.2 percent, to close at $76.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Turkey's central bank magic? 10 billion dollars profit on balance sheet in one day\n\nBefore the central bank's profit surge, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan unveiled measures aimed at compensating lira investors for their losses. The Turkish lira fell 44% against the dollar last year, in large part because the Turkish central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by a cumulative 500 basis points since September.\n\nThe lira's depreciation has exacerbated consumer price inflation, which ended last year at more than 36%, the highest level since September 2002. Erdogan's popular support has suffered. But even with guaranteed returns on lira deposits, Turkish investors are still holding foreign currency, undercutting Erdogan's efforts to boost the lira without raising interest rates.\n\n6.
