And interestingly sometimes it does this. The market almost priced in a recession at the end of 2018, but that didn't happen because the FED dramatically changed course and most investors clearly didn't expect that.\n\nThat said, I think a lot of the time there are clear signs that something is wrong and a crash is likely if you're paying attention... It's really quite easy to look at a broad market index like the S&P500 and compare it to past valuations. If it's mostly inline with historical valuations (when adjusting for interest rates and growth, etc) then you probably don't need to worry about a bubble in the broader market.\n\nLast year and the second half of 2020 was probably an exception. Most people simply don't realise how massive the impact of interest rates are on valuations so many here were confused how the market could run up so much during a pandemic. Truth is interest rates are simply way more import than earnings until you zoom out to the scale of multiple years or decades, only then do markets trend more with earnings than rates. This is why I and those taking the time to calculate fair value on the S&P500 weren't too worried. I'm going to take a guess and say the people calling for a crash were probably all on Reddit. It was also a weird recession where demand for tech jumped significantly. Companies which have large weighting in the indexes like Apple and Amazon did very well from the pandemic which when combined with low interest rates was a massive catalyst for an extremely strong market in 2021.\n\nBut now everything that made the market great last year is disappearing. People have brought their new Windows / Apple laptops. We don't need to order everything from Amazon or Shopify sites anymore. We're not getting stimulus checks to spend on a new pair of Nike trainers or a Netflix subscription. Interest rates are likely going to increase quickly because of inflation. All this adds up to lower growth and higher interest rates which basically guarantees lower returns in 2022.\n\nNow could something random happen and change this outlook? Sure. No one can tell you with 100% confidence what's going to happen just like no one could have told you there was going to be a global pandemic in 2019. What I will say is that valuations seem quite reasonable right now. The S&P500 probably needs to fall a bit more and seems to be about 5-10% too high, but so long as earnings go well and the FED doesn't make a huge policy error there's no obvious reason to think markets will crash.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that markets are mostly rational and you can absolute reason about valuations to level of accuracy. Understanding where fair value is in the market can help you understand the relative risk and reward of an investment, but markets are not completely rational and the world isn't completely predictable. So while it's not completely random large unforeseen market moving events by their nature generally do require some level of irrationality or randomness.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Best comment here", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.011332830414175987}], "tickers": ["bubble", "amzn", "nflx", "recession", "aapl", "inflation", "crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Just invest in companies you believe in and keep some cash available to buy the dip.

{"title": "The bond market may collapse first.", "selftext": "\nLong-term U.S. government bonds are completely mispriced vs. rising inflation today.\nThis disconnect will not be solved overnight, even if COVID-19 pandemic supply chain issues disappear quickly in 2022.\nFar greater interest rates to match stubbornly high inflation may be the only way to stave off a U.S. currency crisis soon.\nLong-bond ETFs like TLT should be sold and avoided, until inflation cools markedly, the stock market crashes and/or consumer spending falls substantially to better balance with constrained supply.\n\nI have been growing increasingly bearish and pessimistic about the outlook for U.S. interest rates and the bond market generally since the middle of 2020. The extend and pretend exercise of low interest rates and record rates of money printing can only continue so long, before something breaks. The Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet is approaching $9 trillion in bonds, a source of direct interference in our free-market capitalistic system, outrunning any previous central bank shenanigan in human history. Now with inflation beginning to skyrocket as CPI YoY passed +7% in December, either interest rates will rise markedly in 2022 to rebalance the economy, or we risk even higher moves into the annualized 10% or greater CPI range by the end of the year (only rivaled by Civil War inflation), with a massive destructive interest rate spike into the stratosphere soon thereafter.\n\nReally, the last remaining economic scenario to prevent a major rise in long-term interest rates, and properly match escalating inflation, is a stock market crash ASAP followed by a disinflationary recession to properly rebalance consumer supply/demand. Yippie! However, since the stock market refuses to decline for more than a day or two, a monster decline in bond market pricing, including products like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), may lie dead ahead.\n\nDon\u2019t take my word for it.

In theory and if the FED only wants to use interest rate to fight against inflation, then the interest rate has to be higher than the inflation rate to avoid, that the money in the saving accounts do loose purchasing power. This would mean the interest rate would have to be more than 8% to fight the inflation of 7.5%. Ofcourse interest rate of 8% (or even 5%) is ridiculous, they would kill the housing market, since people won't be able to buy (or refinance) houses with mortgages. However the FED (& government) can as well increase the reserve requirements for banks, which would cause that banks have to hold more cash in their balance sheet in order to sell loans. The reserve requirements for deposit in US banks is set at 0% since March 2020. This means all of your money in the bank (saving accounts) is not backed at all (in theory). They can now increase the reserve ratio back to 10%, which would cause, that banks have to hold more cash in their balance sheet. How do banks make profits? 50% of JPMorgans revenue comes from retail banking e.g. with selling mortgages. Means mortgage rate should increase and we should see a decrease in demand in the housing market. Another option is to issue bonds and hope that the bonds are attractive enough that investors do want to hold bonds again in their portfolios.\n\nSince the FED is planning as well to shrink their balance sheet, this should cause in theory the bond prices to drop and the bond yield to increase. Normally when bond prices decrease, the stock prices do go up. However the actions to shrink the balance sheet should be defined here (only speculation possible at the moment).\n\nPotential shrinkage actions are to hold these bonds to maturity (according to BIS avg. remaining maturity of the held bonds are 5.3 years based on December 2021) or sell actively  bonds in the secondary market. As a reminder TLT ETF does hold only 20y+ US treasury bonds. However IEF is an ETF with 10y US treasury bonds. \n\nWith QE the FED bought all of the US gov bonds, mostly fixed rate. This caused the liquidity trap in the bond market, which forced financial institutions to invest their money elsewhere e.g. in the stock market or real estate (maybe a bit in crypto). Since the US gov has such a huge debt (over $30trillion), the only way to get more money is to borrow money with issuing US treasury bonds, this is probably a never ending cycle. When the FED (and other central banks) do stop QE (buying up all bonds) then normally foreign countries and institutions (pension funds etc.) will start to add more bonds to their portfolio. Which means there will be more inflow into bonds, less into stock market and probably even more outflow of the stock market as we have seen the last 3 months. \n\nIf they start to sell these bonds, this will cause the market values of the bonds to drop. The crazy thing is it is not just the FED, which do want to sell their bonds, but also the ECB and Bank of England. \n\nThink about it, if FED stops QE (should cause a drop in demand for bonds) the market values of the bonds should drop as well, means bonds ETF should tank (only if other financial institutions can't fill the gap in demand for these bonds). \n\nHow do you short the bond market as an investor?
