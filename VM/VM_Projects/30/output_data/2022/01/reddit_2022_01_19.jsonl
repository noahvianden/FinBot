{"title": "Thoughts on Upstart (UPST)?", "selftext": "I only have one share I bought at roughly $43.  It\u2019s definitely been fun watching this stock rise over the last year or so and I was sure tempted to sell around its peak but I\u2019ve had a long view on the company since hearing about it.\n\nSince it\u2019s settled down lately, (roughly $109 as of today) would this seem like a good window to add to a position? \n\nI\u2019m not looking for someone to tell me what to do, more just looking for general discussion because I feel like most resources I find feel artificial and have their own motive. I just want to know what other investors like myself think. As I\u2019ve said I\u2019m bullish but I\u2019ve also only been investing for about 2 years so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m coming to that conclusion.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m just about as new to Reddit as I am to investing and the bot scared me about my post being low effort to not having enough DD. Like some have already said I do think it\u2019s priced higher than other companies in that sector which I believe is in part to the retail investing trend and UPST using AI which I think anything tech related excites people, especially those type of investors. Potentially those peaks just being due to hope for some insane breakout and realistically falling somewhere in the middle of where it was and where it is now. Even though it\u2019s priced higher I do think potentially disrupting the loan industry could be positive for the masses and deserve a higher valuation than existing business models in that sector. Amazon, Netflix, Tesla, Microsoft all have made moves to try and disrupt their industries and they have seemingly paid off. I\u2019m not trying to say Upstart will blow up to that magnitude but it could be a push in a better direction.  I\u2019ll just end this by saying if I didn\u2019t include enough stats in this my bad, I\u2019ve buried my nose in numbers and articles about this and just came here for a more laid back, human discussion about the topic.", "id": "s7jzo6", "created_utc": 1642575095.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nPlease direct all simple questions towards the stickied Daily Discussion and Quarterly Rate My Portfolio threads (sort by Hot, they're at the top).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It was way too expensive at $390 though. I got in earlier last year when it was under $100 but sold after it jumped up to ~$150. I was hoping it would come back down all year, but to my surprise it just kept going up. It's still a bit expensive, but it has extremely strong growth so that needs to be factored in -- if they can continue growing at a similar pace in 2022 I believe the stock probably deserves its multiple.\n\nThe less optimistic view would be that interest rate rises or a weaker economy causes their growth to slow. Another risk would be that one of their major partners pulls out as over 80% of their revenue comes from just two partners which is concerning. However on the flip side I would say this also suggests potential upside as clearly adding just one good partner in 2022 could significantly improve revenues.\n\nLong-term I'm less bullish. I think there is a risk large competitors will eventually enter the space and I don't feel UPST has an extremely strong moat. You really have to believe in the team's ability to deliver a market leading product. Some positives is that they have a first mover advantage and a team of ex-Google execs, plus the big players in this space aren't exactly known for being great at innovation and other fintech companies have proven they can be disrupted by innovative tech-focused startups. I can see a good future for UPST but I'd much rather take profits on a volatile high-risk stock like this.\n\nI think you also need to keep in mind that the stock has fallen over 70% in 3 months and many analysts still have price targets in excess of $200 on the stock. I get that doesn't really mean anything from a long-term fundamental valuation perspective, but it at least suggests there were buyers at higher prices in recent history which is nice to know given nothing has fundamentally changed with the business in those 3 months. Sentiment in both the fintech and growth tech space is very poor right now and if this changes we could see a nice rally just based on improved sentiment alone.\n\nWhether it's a good stock for you depends on what you're looking for. If you're looking for something with huge upside potential and are happy to take the risk I think UPST is great. If you're looking for a safe passive investment that's going to give you steady long-term returns, UPST probably isn't the stock for you.

Companies need to pay for labor and goods, both of which are surging in price right now. When that happens, they make less money. When they make less money, their stock becomes less valuable and goes down. This is an ongoing issue with no clear end. Inflation will only continue to have an effect on businesses while the CPI stays where it is.\n\nThere is also the question of high valuations. Many stocks were pushed to price levels not justified by their fundamentals. (Think paying $400 for a penny because someone else did before you.) Now, people are realizing that they overpaid and the current market prices can't be well justified. Demand for those stocks fall as buyers dry up. Less demand = prices fall.\n\nThen consider interest rates. Nobody knows when or how much they will go up for sure, but it's clear they *are* going up. This causes many businesses (especially growth) to be able to invest less money in their growth than they would be able to otherwise, thus make less money, thus not grow as fast, which leads to a repricing of their previous growth expectations that were already priced into their valuations.\n\nA solid understanding of economics and monetary policy would likely help you a lot.
