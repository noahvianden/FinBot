Because the market can most afford to lose if the public does not put too much emphasis on the destruction of retirement accounts.  Private funding, tax breaks for continuing employment programs, war chests of cash all will have a more positive effect on employment while inflation caused by opportunistic greed will wane as a business survival technique.

They actually do well in these times.  \n\nBut the continued .5% Fed interest hikes, while slowing inflation somewhat, will continue to plague the overall market while killing off or forcing retreat of the typical laptop retail investors.
