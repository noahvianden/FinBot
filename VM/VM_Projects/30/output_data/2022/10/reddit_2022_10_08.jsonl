{"title": "The Philadelphia Phillies will determine when the recession starts, not JPOW", "selftext": "Alright regards and aspiring regards. I don't know shit and neither do you. But what I do is the city of Philadelphia is fucking cursed. MLB playoffs started today, and the Philadelphia Phillies are still playing. Why is this a big deal? Because everyone and their mother should be rooting against them. The Phillies have won two World Series titles since they became the Phillies:\n\n1980: Phillies defeated the Kansas City Royal 4-2 to win the World Series.\n\n2008: Phillies defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 4-1 to win the World Series.\n\nWhy does this matter? Just look at the years they won. \n\n1980: The U.S. was in early recession at the start of the decade, with the end of the recession coming around July of the same year. From 1981-1982 stocks saw little to no economic growth with interest rates continuing to rise despite the recession being over. This recession didn't officially end until 1983. \n\nGuess what happened in 1983...\n\nThe Baltimore Orioles defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 4-1 to win the World Series.\n\nThey wouldn't win another World Title until 2008. Which, you know, was only the biggest economic shit-show that most of us here have ever experienced. Do I even need to go into detail about how fucked up 2008 was? It's because the Phillies won the World Series, fight me. I'm convinced the only reason the economy eventually turned itself around was because the following year, 2009:\n\nThe New York Yankees defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 4-2 to win the World Series.\n\nIf you want to get super technical, in 1929 the Philadelphia Athletics defeated the Chicago Cubs 4-2 to win the World Series. The Great Depression followed throughout the entirety of the 1930's afterwards.\n\nHell, if you don't believe me, I have one more though it's a bit of a stretch. In 2017, the Philadelphia Eagles and Nick \"Big Dick\" Foles defeated the New England Patriots 41-33 to win their first Super Bowl in franchise history. Later that year, the corn market crashed. With corn dropping as much as 36% in mid-July 2017. \n\nAt the time of me writing this, the Philadelphia Phillies are leading the St. Louis Cardinals 1-0 in the NLWC, with an impressive win today in the 9th inning. The Philadelphia Eagles have the best record in the NFL as the only undefeated team remaining. Not much on the 76ers, but they're probably fucked too. \n\nTLDR: Go Cardinals.
