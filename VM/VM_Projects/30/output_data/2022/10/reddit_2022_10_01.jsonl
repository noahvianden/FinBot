Company is losing money every quarter. \n\nDo i need to continue? I\u2019m sure there will be plenty more in the comments. \n\nBUT if we take a closer look at this beaten down company we can see the following facts. \n\n1. A new factory has been built and is capable of 2500 BEV trucks per year. \n2. Phase 2 of the factory on pace to be completed in 2023 which will add 20k capacity.\n3. Confirmed orders and rave reviews from customers. \n4. Successful Beta testing of the Hydrogen trucks and partnerships with TC energy to build put infrastructure. \n5. $3 hydrogen credits and energy partnerships to bring the cost of hydrogen in par or cheaper than Gas \n6. Budweiser, Walmart and other large fleets testing vehicles. \n7. Revenue growth figures over or near 100% QoQ/YoY\n8. Trial ending this month and the possibility Nikola will collect 150mm from Trevor. \n9. New CEO Michael Lohscheller to take over in 2023. His past experience as CFO at Mitsubishi and Volkswagen as well as expertise in scaling manufacturing. \n10. Partner with IVECO to also scale in Europe. \n\n\nAll this for 1.5bn valuation and $3.5 per share. This stock may very well keep going down but if they continue to grow their sales not even the Fed and shorts can keep this company\u2019s stock price rolling down hill. \n\nOk ready for the grief but remember big money is made by those that go against the grain.", "id": "xt7cg7", "created_utc": 1664661299.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 41, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|44|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xt7cg7)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xt7cg7)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12115540355443954}, {"body": "Nice bags", "score": 25, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.025025077164173126}, {"body": "Nikola CEO Continues to Sell Stock\r  \nSep 30, 2022\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis pretty much offsets whatever positive you were able to find in this company.", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Planned selling from a long time ago.
