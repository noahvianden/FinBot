Fear is your biggest enemy.", "selftext": "Ray Dalio is doing little more than securing his legacy as a guy they didn\u2019t get forced out of his own company.\n\nIf you understand the culture he built at Bridgewater then you\u2019ll understand why it\u2019s so significant he isn\u2019t dying in his office.\n\nNothing he\u2019s saying is all that profound or even accurate in some cases.  He\u2019s just painting a very grim and very broad macro picture that assumes the world economy is a force of nature.  It\u2019s not.  Like pollution it can easily change course.\n\nAs for your investments, the environment we\u2019re in now is not remotely close to what was happening in the 70\u2019s/80\u2019s and people are drawing unfair parallels.\n\nBack then, rampant inflation had been going on for more than a decade.  There was an aggressive inflation fight happening for some time.  The gold standard was abandoned among other significant political events, and widespread passive investment wasn\u2019t a thing.  Plus, relative multiples were pretty low and it was still rather fashionable for companies to pay high dividends.  So the market didn\u2019t NEED to go up constantly for people to make money.\n\nIf you want to compare it to anything, in the 1920\u2019s we experienced a similar post-war/post-pandemic economic slump with high inflation.  It let to the roaring 20\u2019s and arguably the greatest bull run in history.\n\nWhat investors should be doing now is asking themselves where best to park their money given the potential for 8% inflation for the next couple of years.\n\nBonds?  No.  That\u2019s stupid.  They don\u2019t pay nearly enough to justify.\n\nReal Estate?  Maybe if you bought it before the price spikes.  Now it almost pays less than bonds but with higher risk.  So that\u2019s out of the question.\n\nAlternate assets like art and collectibles?  Crapshoot as to what will hold value and what won\u2019t.  Especially at a time when our culture is changing so rapidly that once significant assets are now deprecated.\n\nLiquid alts like private equity?  Late to the party.  Now that the east money is turned off there\u2019s not much opportunity left.  For those funds already open, their only hope of cashing out is IPO which isn\u2019t happening any time soon.  For the ones that actually plan on holding their portfolio long term, we\u2019re heading into an engineered recession so earning will be subdued same as public equities only you\u2019ll have less transparency.\n\nPublic equities are about the only real option you have.  As much as people what to turn their hair gray complaining about absurd multiples and earnings contractions, the major indices aren\u2019t selling for all that much and are populated with much larger and healthier businesses than \u201801 and better capitalized and legally protected banks than \u201808.\n\nThis is one of those times where we have nothing to fear but fear itself.\n\nBuy and hold with money you don\u2019t need.
