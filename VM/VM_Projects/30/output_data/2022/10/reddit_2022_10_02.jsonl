{"title": "Expected Moves this week: SPY, QQQ, Google, Amazon and more.", "selftext": "### The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week \u2013**\u00a0Following a volatile week of large moves in both directions the SPY ended the week down 2.9% following two weekly declines near 5%. The 2.9% decline was about in line with what options were pricing.\n\n**This Week \u2013**\u00a0SPY options are again pricing about a 2.8% move for the upcoming week.\n\n**Implied Volatility / VIX \u2013**\u00a0The VIX closed the week near 32, up from 30 the week before. It is near some of its highest closing levels of 2022.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week**\u00a0(via Options AI)\n\n* SPY\u00a0**2.8%**\u00a0(+/- $11)\n* QQQ\u00a0**3.4%**\u00a0(+/- $10)\n* IWM\u00a0**3.5%**\u00a0(+/- $6)\n* DIA\u00a0**2.4%**\u00a0(+/- $8)\n\n**Economic Calendar**\n\n* Monday \u2013 ISM Manufacturing\n* Tuesday \u2013 Fed speeches: Williams, Mester, Daly\n* Wednesday \u2013 ADP Employment, ISM Services\n* Friday \u2013 Non farm payrolls\n\n## \n\n## In the News\n\nLast week I looked at how high vol was in the FAANG+ names and detailed some Iron Condors in Amazon. AMZN stock closed last week about where it ended the week before, however, overall market IV was higher. So a scorecard on high IV neutral trades would look like this so far. Stock not moving: yes, IV going lower: no.\n\nMost of these names begin to report in late October with some reporting before Oct 21st expiry, like TSLA, and others after, like AMZN and GOOGL. With that in mind, and with IV even higher let\u2019s look at another high IV strategy for those that may be looking to turn bullish in a stock. We\u2019ll use GOOGL, as an example, using Oct 21st expiry, as earnings don\u2019t come into play until the week after. And we\u2019ll compare two credit put spreads, one at the money, the other out of the money:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lj9t0zoejer91.png?width=498&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fe2ac758c23c94bad4a83411afa6174485e531c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sqs7itrfjer91.png?width=495&format=png&auto=webp&s=da22cbc31d24db489f667c11d13290ed83f5482b\n\nThe first put spread sells the at the money put and buys the expected move put, risking 3, to make 2, if GOOGL is above $94 on Oct 21st. With the way stocks are whipping around this type of trade can be thought of as a fairly straightforward bullish play, with a little but of wiggle room below where the stock is trading (but not much). The more important factor is with IV this high, this trade doesn\u2019t need a big snapback rally. It just needs a small one, or even one that starts from lower and just gets back to this point in the stock. In other words it doesn\u2019t necessarily need to have its timing exactly right, nor its magnitude of move exactly right. Playing for a reversal with calls or debit call spreads kind of needs to have those things perfect at this point, with IV so high.\n\nThe second trade is an out-of-the-money put spread, risking about 75 to make 25 with its strikes set at the expected move. This is the type of trade someone does when they just think IV is beginning to overprice downside risk, and often at levels where they\u2019d psychologically be a buyer of the stock. The advantage with a credit put spread vs a cash-secured put is that if the market crashes, it\u2019s just a $75 loss rather than unlimited risk below.\n\nGOOGL is simply an example here. There are a ton of similar stocks with similarly high IV at the moment. Eventually, there will be a snapback rally where calls work, but until then it\u2019s interesting to look at some credit spreads and the defined risk associated with selling moves rather than trying to time them for a reversal.\n\n## \n\n## Earnings\n\n*Links*\u00a0below go to the Options AI calendar where you can see the other companies each day and click through to see charts (free to use).

If a company wants to use the lidar data for anything besides \"there *something* in this area\", they need to label the data to train on it. And it seems like labeling images or video would be wayyy easier for humans than labeling a lidar point cloud or whatever you get out of a radar.\n\nTesla spent a decent amount of time during AI day talking about autolabeling, and a lot about catching bad labeling and fixing it. And they can do a ton of it automatically, but that's only because they have so much labeled data, and they've invested so much in creating custom labeling tools for human labelers. To make a great autolabeler, you need to start with a ton of high quality labeled data, and it's a constant iterative process to improve it.\n\nNo one is doing perception perfectly, not using any combination of sensors. The question is how quickly can you improve your perception system to reduce the errors more and more, even in very difficult situations. And it seems like with video it's possible to create a lot of very high quality labeled data, with very few mistakes (or at least mistakes that are much easier to catch) and use that to train an autolabeler. Which creates a lot more high quality data with mistakes that are relatively easy to catch and fix, and you can feed that in to your training and then find areas where you need more data and label that, etc. It's an accelerating feedback loop because every step makes the next step faster and more reliable.\n\nBut I have to wonder if labeling lidar data is just very slow and unnatural and has more mistakes (or uncertainty) just because it's not how humans see the world so it's much harder for us to label the data manually.

If you go outside during a rain storm, point your camera at a light source and take a picture, you don't get dozens of light ghosts in the frame. On top of that, lidar is a system where you have to spit photons and then observe their effects on the world to generate data for the ego to work on. FSD consumes photons that naturally exist and works on them via the ego. The inherent energy efficiencies are staggering when you factor in the law of large numbers.\n\nhttps://velodynelidar.com/blog/lidar-and-power-consumption-electric-vehicles/#:~:text=Let's%20compare%20power%20consumption%20of,consumes%20up%20to%2055%20W.\n\n43-55W consumed actively for lidar and will only work if the weather conditions are perfect.

And it seemed like a pretty good demonstration of the tech, and I figured that might be a big breakthrough that would lead to more widespread robotaxis, but then I've heard nothing about it since then.\n\nMy guess is that they could get it to function well with a lot of work in a single area? Or maybe it had a ton of false negatives and ended up filtering out important data sometimes? Or maybe it is working and they're using it, but that wasn't the limiting factor?\n\nIt does seem like it would be technically possible to have people go through and label a pointcloud with good datapoints and noise datapoints and then train a NN to do that filtering? But it's the kind of thing that would require a ton of labeled data, and getting that kind of resolution with human labeling would take forever.\n\nAnother approach might be to compare a noisy point cloud dataset from a rainy day to sunny day and try to do the filtering by comparing them. But then you'd probably need humans to at least label all the moving objects or anything that changed (trash on the ground, leaves, etc.)\n\nActually, Tesla might have a path to autolabeling lidar data if they ever wanted to do that. If you start with the occupancy grid and compare *that* to lidar you could probably filter out the noisy data from the lidar pointcloud and then use that as labeled data to train a NN to filter out precipitation.\n\nOf course Tesla probably doesn't need lidar, especially if their occupancy network continues to improve. But I could see them using a similar technique to train a perception network for an HD radar or something like that? Radar might be useful because it can see through rain and fog, etc. so it could compliment passive photon detection in a useful way.

Which is that both these articles basically state that sensor fusion of data is mandatory. This means you need lidar and radar and camera and a host of other sensors and then you need to act on all that all at once to build your space time slice to act on.\n\nThis adds not only complexity to the ego to handle, it makes the hardware stack on the car expensive. Worse, if sensor fusion is mandatory, then each new sensor system you add into the matrix is going to draw on the EV's battery and that's less range for the consumer. That then means that the car is going to get a bigger battery to compensate. Which makes it heavier. Which means it will also need more cooling to deal with all that battery material. Which means more power draw to cool it. Which means less range for the consumer.\n\nThe extra battery mass means more needs to be mined, purified, and transformed up the supply chain, which is still in it's nascent stages of expansion.\n\nAnd all that cost will ultimately get passed onto the consumer unless each car maker intends to sell the vehicle at a loss to the tune of hundreds of thousands lost and then multiply that by millions of vehicles. You'd be committing market suicide. Oof.\n\nSo Tesla said \"we're gonna do everything with cameras, and we'll build the equivalent of a sensor fusion stack via software using raw photon counts.\" This is smart because you have a single ingress for the visual nature of reality and you can freely swap between sensor interpretations by software without the excess hardware, cost, power requirements, thermal management, range degradation, and creation of upstream supply chain crises.\n\nTesla is approaching FSD as:\n\n# THE ENTIRE PROBLEM\n\nCompanies selling lidar are basically only focusing on that niche. They don't care about what supply chain havoc that causes, it's not relevant to their business. And this is an important point that's often lost in the mix. **Everything you add to the EV must pull power from the battery.**\n\nIt's easier to swap software, it's just an OTA. You can't ota new sensors into a car at will. You can't remove existing sensors from the car via OTA either. Also the potential for software itself for sensor interpretation. NASA figured out how to do spectrum analysis of distant stars and planets using the visible light mirror of Hubble by writing insanely clever software. That's what Tesla is doing.

You only have to maintain the active record state.\n\nThis is a latency advantage that simply cannot be equaled.

{"title": "Ok hear me out about this", "selftext": "Nice I got your attention, I know you crayon eating autists dont have a long attention span but I am hoping it is long enough to read the following.\n\nSo you missed Tesla, you missed GME, are you going to miss Palantir? I know I am risking a perma ban here (that is what it feels like if I bring the ticker symbol up for a split second). But I want to write a few points about Palantir and why the stock is heavily oversold.\n\nThis month alone Palantir signed contracts worth a total of about $700M+ in rev. A lot is still in the government (gov is still a money printer, if they get addicted to Palantir they cant go back, and they give of some junkie vibes). They are aiming for a revenue of about 1,9 B this year (Q1 was $446M and Q2 was $473M).\n\nIt is true that Palantir still is not profitable, and Karp says it will be in 2025 (people argue that if they stop the SBC program they would be already profitable). So okay 2 years no profit, I think Alex Karp is wrong here when you see that in one month Palantir is able to fork in 700M$ of signed deals you can only imagine what the company could do in 2023. I think the sales team is heating up, for commercial clients this would be sufficient. I mean if you are a government you dont want to speak to a VP of sales but to the CEO, so I think Alex Karp is still closing the government deals and the sales team is picking up the commercial deals to relieve some pressure from Karp.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qmy4n4bkldr91.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c85a90b3f5cac230ac127bdb432ae5a5ff130811\n\nSo Palantir has made his way into western governments to make money and get them addicted to the product (some deals they signed this month are long term and end by 2028 for example). But next to this Palantir has got a nice war chest to get through these difficult times (bear market, war in Ukraine, inflation), because they got $2,4B in cash, no debt, option to withdraw $950M of credit (not from credit suisse lol), and $50,7 M of gold bars (dafuq). So no need for hedge funds to worry about the health of Palantir.\n\nSo why wouldn't you YOLO into this stock?\n\n\\-ChrisPBacon\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My position](https://preview.redd.it/h5sc1yn0odr91.png?width=838&format=png&auto=webp&s=32beae759d11b6c40c808f9413664b54f83bad18)", "id": "xtm8k5", "created_utc": 1664709387.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.33, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|6|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wuqrvw/dd_avantium_avtx/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xtm8k5)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xtm8k5)\n    \nHey /u/crispbacon89, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1490 shares", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26011115312576294}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24387383460998535}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Or because Cathy Wood did?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "She sold out?", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2953319549560547}, {"body": "Now now now everyone makes mistakes.
