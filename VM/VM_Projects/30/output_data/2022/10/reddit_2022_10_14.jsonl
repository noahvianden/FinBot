Once I got above the $25K threshold, I started really following economic data and DXY & bonds in real time and started day trading. Obviously there's some up and down in there, but I got out of bad trades quickly for the most part and knew not to fight the Fed. Just in the last couple days, there was some luck involved. I bought 14x 10/21 $356 calls because I had a weird feeling about CPI reaction. I thought I was screwed when we opened around $349 yesterday, but I didn't panic sell my calls, and we all know what happened after that.

All of this volatility has me confused however I held 3 QQQ puts into next weeks open.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hi there, I'll try to answer your questions as best I can.  A lot of the decisions I make are situational.  I follow the market very closely on a day to day basis.  More recently, I use the investing.com app to follow the dollar index (DXY) and bonds (2 yr, 10 yr, 30 yr). Right now, obviously inflation and Fed action is what's been driving markets. The US dollar is around all time highs in terms of strength, and bonds are also very high historically speaking. Therefore, the markets are very sensitive to those 2 indicators. When the dollar and bond yields go up, the markets have been going down and vice versa. This has been the \"hack\" I've been using lately to help with my decisions.\n\nI generally don't bail on options too quickly unless it's apparent that it's going to continue losing value. For example, yesterday when SPY opened at 349ish and started going up, I bought a handful of $350 puts. They started losing value right away, and the clear momentum was upward. Knowing this was the day CPI was released, I recognized that it was a sentiment shift, and I bailed out of those puts at a loss.  \n\nFor my non-day trading options plays (which are 90% puts lately given what the Fed is doing), I have been buying expirations that are 3-4 weeks out and either just in the money or very close to the money. Yes, these generally have high premiums, but instead of chasing a far out of the money strike, you are working from a neutral spot. Also by doing this, if the market has a few days that go in the opposite direction of your options, you have a time buffer for it swing back in your favor. You can also average down when this happens if you so choose.  For day trades, I've choosing expirations that are a couple days out, and I generally buy the nearest in the money strike to the current price. I've been buying 10-15 (sometimes 20) of these options at a time, and with volatility being high lately, the price moves quick. I don't hold onto these day trades for too long and secure profits as they come. Yes, sometimes it goes in the wrong direction on these types of trades, but you have to be smart about cutting bait and taking a loss if it's going bad quickly.\n\nI honestly don't know where the market is headed from here, which is why I sold the majority of my options today. I think ultimately we're headed lower, but we are definitely oversold and due a little sustained bear market rally. Generally speaking, I'm buying puts on any sizeable move to the upside and holding for at least a week or 2. None of this is a science; if it was, there'd be a lot of people following the science. But I feel like I've gotten better at understanding the ebbs and flows of the market by following everything so closely and seeking out any piece of news that could sway markets that I can.\n\nBest of luck in your trading, and hopefully my novel of answers to your questions is helpful!", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Our AI tracks our most intelligent users.

I generally try not to let my options expire worthless. Maybe a few hedge options here and there that are super far OTM will expire worthless, but if it's super clear that I'm going to continue losing money and expiration is within a few days, I generally sell. You have to separate yourself from the \"what if\" situation, i.e. \"what if the market reverses course and I make back my losses?\" More often than not, it doesn't, and losses can accelerate quickly. It's better preserve the value you still have left in the options so that you can make another - hopefully better - play. Options that are in the money at expiration will auto-sell if you don't have the funds to exercise, so expiring in the money isn't a situation I come across. I generally try not to be holding options terribly close to explain because the intrinsic value is gone.

Ladies and Gentleman, we got him", "selftext": "[https://nytimes.com/2022/10/14/business/trevor-milton-nikola-fraud.html](https://nytimes.com/2022/10/14/business/trevor-milton-nikola-fraud.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Trevor Milton was accused of boasting about nonexistent technology to inflate the stock price of Nikola, a maker of electric trucks.\n\nA federal jury on Friday found Trevor Milton guilty of defrauding investors by lying about the supposed technical achievements of Nikola, the electric truck maker he founded.\n\nMr. Milton was convicted of one count of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud, the most serious of which carry a maximum prison sentence of 20 years. He was acquitted on an additional count of securities fraud. The jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan delivered the verdict after about four weeks of testimony and about six hours of deliberation.\n\nProsecutors portrayed Mr. Milton, 40, as a serial fabricator who wooed investors by falsely claiming that Nikola was close to producing long-haul trucks that could run emission-free on cheap hydrogen.\n\n\u201cTrevor Milton is a con man,\u201d Jordan Estes, assistant U.S. attorney, said Thursday as she summarized the government\u2019s case. \u201cHe lied to investors to get their money, plain and simple.\u201d\n\nDefense attorneys argued that Mr. Milton did not intend to defraud anybody and that his statements were not responsible for a plunge in Nikola's stock price that wiped out billions of dollars in value.\n\nMarc Mukasey, a defense lawyer, acknowledged that Mr. Milton sometimes spoke in the present tense about things Nikola hoped to achieve in the future. \u201cHe loved Nikola,\u201d Mr. Mukasey told jurors on Thursday, likening Mr. Milton to an overenthusiastic parent who brags about his child.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Mukasey said, \u201cWe respect the verdict, but we\u2019re going to keep fighting.\u201d\n\nMr. Milton, who had appeared cheerful during much of the trial, shook his head in apparent disbelief after hearing the verdict. His wife, Chelsey Milton, leaned her head against the back of a courtroom bench and sobbed.\n\nU.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos, who presided over the trial, allowed Mr. Milton to remain free on a $100 million bond until sentencing in January.\n\nThe case provided a lesson in the hazards of investing in fledgling \u201cpre-revenue\u201d electric vehicle makers that have ideas but limited or nonexistent sales. With the exception of Tesla, new carmakers have struggled with manufacturing problems.\n\nIn a recent example, [Rivian](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/07/business/rivian-recall-steering.html), a maker of electric pickup trucks, said last week that it was recalling almost all of the vehicles it has produced because a small number have an improperly tightened fastener that could cause the steering to malfunction.\n\nThe Milton trial was also a was a test of prosecutors\u2019 ability to hold managers of publicly traded companies accountable for statements they make on social media and other public forums that can cause share prices to gyrate. Mr. Milton was a prolific user of Twitter and frequently appeared on podcasts and business news programs.\n\nA college dropout with no formal training in engineering, Mr. Milton founded Nikola in 2015 in the basement of his Salt Lake City home. The company listed on Nasdaq in 2020 by merging with a special purpose acquisition corporation, or SPAC, called VectoIQ Acquisition Corporation. VectoIQ is managed by Stephen Girsky, a former high-ranking executive at General Motors. The deal with the so-called blank-check corporation allowed Nikola to avoid some of the regulatory scrutiny usually applied to initial public offerings.\n\nAfter the stock market listing made him wealthy, Mr. Milton, who [owned 25 percent of Nikola shares](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/business/nikola-trevor-milton-fraud.html), went on a spending spree, buying luxuries including a Gulfstream jet and a multimillion-dollar home in the Turks and Caicos Islands. In about six months during 2020, according to testimony, Mr. Milton spent more than $80 million.\n\nNikola shares peaked near $80 in June 2020, when the company was worth more than Ford Motor. Shortly after, the investment firm Hindenburg Research issued a [report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/) accusing Mr. Milton of making numerous false assertions about the company's technology, pointing to a video in which a truck was rolled down an incline to make it look like a working prototype.\n\nMr. Mukasey dismissed the video as mere \u201cspecial effects.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly not a crime to use special effects,\u201d Mr. Mukasey told jurors. \u201cOtherwise the government would have to indict the Energizer Bunny.\u201d\n\nMr. Milton [resigned](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/business/nikola-trevor-milton-resigns.html) as executive chairman a few weeks after the Hindenburg report. Nikola shares closed Friday at $3.06.\n\nLast year, Nikola agreed to pay a [civil penalty of $125 million ](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/21/business/nikola-sec-fraud-investigation.html?searchResultPosition=2)to settle a fraud investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement.\n\nNikola aspired to be the Tesla of the trucking industry \u2014 both companies took their name from Nikola Tesla, a pioneer in developing alternating-current technology. Nikola planned to build trucks that would be powered by emission-free hydrogen fuel cells. The company would build a network of hydrogen fueling stations along major highways, much as Tesla built a network of charging stations.\n\nDuring the trial, prosecutors played video interviews in which Mr. Milton claimed Nikola was already producing \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen with renewable energy for less than the cost of diesel, a major milestone. \u201cGame is over for diesel,\u201d Mr. Milton said on Twitter.\n\nIn fact, Nikola had produced \u201cnot one molecule\u201d of hydrogen, Ms. Estes said. Others in the fledgling green hydrogen industry are still struggling to produce the gas cheaply enough to undercut diesel.\n\nMr. Milton also said he had billions of dollars in binding contracts with trucking companies to buy Nikola vehicles. The \u201ccontracts\u201d were just reservations that could easily be canceled, prosecutors contended.\n\nAmong the witnesses was Scott Damman, a senior manager at General Motors, which planned to build a battery-powered pickup truck, the Badger, with Nikola. The announcement of the Badger in February 2020 caused a spike in Nikola's stock price.\n\nMr. Damman testified that G.M. would have manufactured the truck and supplied all of the engineering and technology, while Nikola contributed some of the design and marketing.\n\nNonetheless, according to testimony, Mr. Milton said on Twitter and other forums that Nikola was responsible for \u201c100 percent\u201d of the technology in the Badger, portraying G.M. as little more than a supporting player. G.M. pulled out of the partnership soon after the Hindenburg report, and the Badger was never produced.\n\nOther Nikola executives including Mark Russell, the chief executive, and Kim Brady, the chief financial officer, warned Mr. Milton repeatedly that his statements could backfire, prosecutors contended. The executives even staged an \u201cintervention\u201d where they tried, unsuccessfully, to get Mr. Milton to hew to the truth, according to witnesses.\n\nMr. Mukasey, the defense lawyer, pointed to internal Nikola emails in which the executives praised Mr. Milton\u2019s media appearances. \u201cThey were telling Trevor what a good job he was doing,\u201d Mr. Mukasey said.\n\nThe convictions include a charge that Mr. Milton defrauded a man who sold him a ranch in Utah. Mr. Milton paid for the ranch in part with Nikola stock options that proved to be worthless.\n\nThe acquittal on one of the securities fraud counts offered Mr. Milton a bit of relief. A conviction on that charge would have exposed him to a maximum sentence of 25 years.\n\nNikola, based in Phoenix, continues to operate, producing a limited number of battery-powered trucks in cooperation with established companies including IVECO, an Italian truck maker that is manufacturing Nikola vehicles in Germany. Michael Lohscheller, an auto industry veteran who was previously the chief executive of the German carmaker Opel, was named president of Nikola in August. \n\nStefan Hartung, chief executive of the German electronics maker Bosch, said in an interview this month that he still believed in Nikola. Bosch, one of the world's largest makers of components for the vehicle industry, is supplying fuel cell technology for Nikola trucks being developed.\n\n\u201cWe are now pretty far in terms of industrialization capability,\u201d Mr. Hartung said. \u201cThis vehicle can be built.\u201d", "id": "y46ero", "created_utc": 1665784480.0, "score": 67, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 39, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|67|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=y46ero)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=y46ero)\n    \n>TL;DR: Trevor Milton was convicted of securities fraud and wire fraud after lying to investors about the technical achievements of Nikola, the electric truck company he founded.
