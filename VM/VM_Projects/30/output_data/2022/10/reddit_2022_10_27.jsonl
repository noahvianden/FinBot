{"title": "Crazy Scenario: TWTR Options Expire Worthless?", "selftext": "I have what may seem like a crazy scenario, so I'm hoping someone with deep experience in options will be able to tell me how this will work out. TL:DR at the bottom.\n\nThe Options Clearing Corporation's [Information Memo #50945](https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=50945) deals with the settlement of Twitter options in the event that Musk buys the company. That seems likely to happen tomorrow. The memo states that contracts will be amended so that the deliverable will be the $54.20 in cash rather than Twitter stock. Here's the weird part though... the adjustment doesn't happen until \"the opening of the business day after the merger is consummated.\" If the merger is consummated \\*on\\* Friday, the next business day would be Monday October 31st.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at $53.90 and the NYSE seems poised to de-list it before the market opens on Friday. As such, there is a very good chance that the stock never trades above $54.00.\n\nIf the above happens, what do the holders of $54 Calls expiring on Friday receive? Their options technically won't be in-the-money... and the amendment to deliver the $54.20 in cash won't happen until Monday... so do they expire worthless?\n\nRight now, the options expiring \\*this week\\* can be bought for a return of 5% (assuming they get paid the full amount) while options expiring \\*all other weeks\\* have a return potential of basically 0% (they've fully priced in the deal going through). This is a weird gap that I can't fully explain other than to think there is some crazy tail risk in the settlement process of options expiring this week.\n\nAnyone have any experience with this kind of situation?\n\nTL:DR - If Musk doesn't official close the deal \\*before\\* Friday, the options Expiring on Friday will settle for stock and not cash... which could mean the $54 calls expire worthless?\n\nEdit: [New OCC memo ](https://infomemo.theocc.com/infomemos?number=51250) came out Friday morning. Because the deal closed the day before, the options expiring today are money good.

Don't let this fool you.
