Let me explain my theory on profit vs debt", "selftext": "It\u2019s counter intuitive but many companies don\u2019t want to make profit these days. There are many problems with being profitable. First you have to pay tax on profits. Second making profit is actually difficult. Third if you start to make profit it will never be enough for the market and you can\u2019t sell a story of hyper growth company to pump your stocks.\n\nWhat companies really wanted is asset appreciation whether it be their stocks or real estate. In world of money printing, cheap debt and fiat system, most asset values always go up in price over time. \n\nAppreciating assets allows businesses to cash out refinance at lower rates. Unlike profit, this borrowed money is tax free as per IRS. The tax free borrowed money is then used to boost revenues through ads, pump stocks thru buybacks & sustain lifestyle of executives and their sugar babies. \n\nThe ponzi continues because some of the borrowed money is used to pump the asset prices. Declining rates help as well. As the debt servicing costs decline it boosts the asset prices allowing businesses to get new round of cash out refinance, pay down smaller debt with bigger debt and continue the ponzi.\n\nPowell grew up in different world where companies actually relied on profits for their liquidity. Not anymore. Business models rely heavily on cheap debt these days. In fact they prefer tax free cheap debt over taxable profits which requires running an efficient business and not just financial engineering.\n\nPowell doesn\u2019t understand simple fact it was the declining rates of last 40 years and access to tax free cheap debt that provided liquidity to businesses and also allowed them to keep prices low for their consumers and inflation in check. \n\nIronically declining rates will reduce inflation and increasing rates will increase inflation", "id": "yl6u9l", "created_utc": 1667491844.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.23, "num_comments": 29, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|30|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|45|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yl6u9l)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yl6u9l)\n    \n>TL;DR: Companies no longer rely on profits for liquidity, they prefer tax-free cheap debt.
