Twitter and Instagram are reliant on users in order to charge advertisers.

Apple has increased their Operating Income from $60B in 2017 to over $119B in 2022 as of Sep.\n\nI think that although Meta and Twitter could be socially/culturally popular, Apple will generate they same amount of revenue if those Apps were not offered.

{"title": "$SOLO will be my moonshot. Here's why.", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/in2abgebev2a1.jpg?width=900&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81e768a0cf32f63e909150df4e692138eead5a25\n\nHello, and good morning to all of my fellow regarded people. Let's cut the mustard and get to the meat and potatoes. ElectraMeccanica has created a vehicle that fits a certain niche, which will only expand as they continue to deliver vehicles (103 vehicles as per IR reports), as well as finalizing the testing of said vehicles to ensure this car doesn't end up with the woes of Tesla's QC. As many of you here are now single while your ex wife's boyfriend fills his gas tank, I am observing a vehicle that turns heads, offers ridiculous amounts of value, and keeps my second born virginity safe when your wife asks to come home. To be fair, this is a car for those who literally commute via. personal mobility (think scooters and lifted trucks), companies where they need to send workers on site, delivery people who get you your tendies on a long, rainy night... Why discuss it now?  \n\n\nFor the last three years, I have been watching them despite the rather lackluster (or buying opportunity) stock price. Originally, I scoffed at the idea of a single seater EV that costs as much as a used Honda Civic, but as a Lincoln Tech Grad and car aficionado, the concept was too appealing. From the BMW Isetta to the Reliant Robin, man dreamed of a small, energy efficient mode of transportation. Yet, in the ICE world (Internal Combustion Engine), you trade size/efficiency for power. Thanks to the power density that electric motors can achieve, as well as the relative nature of batteries to be power dense and flexible in terms of placement, the single seat work car now exists, in a form that is not only SAFE [(designed using the \"digital twin\" methodology that Siemens outlines here; note them showcasing the SOLO)](https://new.siemens.com/global/en/company/stories/industry/the-digital-twin.html), but also CONVENIENT. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of my many hurdles explaining this vehicle is obviously it's three wheeled base, and general atypical design. For the poor masses here who have never experienced a vehicle like the Polaris Slingshot, this vehicle actually has immense handling for it's size and power to weight ratios. It's easy in a world full of Tesla's and new EV's to forget consumer markets where people can own more than one car, and since I've moved upstate New York, I find that the folks who live around here are actually curious about these vehicles. Most people who live outside of urban centers, will structure \"grocery runs\" or driving to work, alone. [According to the owner's manual](https://assets.website-files.com/62d8c97213a88d8e7b274f70/62e0f9a8397ead03ac42edfd_EM%20Solo%20(Edition%208)%20alarm%20update.pdf), the SOLO offers 5 ft3 (0.14 m3) of luggage space, which is more than adequate for most people. This metric is important, as from observations over time, most people wouldn't fill this space if shopping alone, or for the family. In NYC where I am from, many of my friends who own vehicles already are actually excited about this car, since they can leave the family vehicle street parked and not risk losing parking altogether, while tucking a SOLO away in front of their property, to charge and ALWAYS BE READY. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI understand that many here will scoff and laugh at this kind of car, but looking at the company's resilience through the pandemic, and careful approach to development, I feel as though this is a stupidly undervalued play. This company used to make bespoke custom vehicles ([Bill Gates was an early adopter](https://driving.ca/auto-news/news/watch-bill-gates-drives-vancouver-made-electric-porsche-356-replica-to-dq)) but restructured with a focus in mind for the future of personal transportation. As of writing this, $SOLO trades at $1.13 since the company doubled down and was in pre-production mode.  I may be hideously wrong, but given how \"normal\" this feels to a standard car, with many perks like parking, HOV access, 100 mile range which most people will never get close to in terms of daily work... I decided to present this to you all as a car company with a proper focus and product.\n\nPizza Hut (namely a franchise owner called American West Restaurant Group) snapped up 14 CARGO VARIANTS as delivery vehicles. [From the article](https://www.thedrive.com/news/california-pizza-huts-to-get-electric-3-wheeled-single-seater-delivery-vehicles):\n\n\"While ElectraMeccanica's announcement didn't include any pictures of the Pizza Hut-branded fleet vehicles, this could end up being even weirder than the DXP. The [ElectraMeccanica Solo](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/27194/electra-meccanica-solo-prototype-drive-quirk-in-progress) Cargo is a single-seat, three-wheeled electric vehicle with a big cargo box on the back.

{"title": "Bet against the Fed: Cutting Rates To 2% Next Year? Someone Really Did This", "selftext": "[Nov 29 Market Morning Brief](https://www.ainvest.com/screener/screen?q=Morning%20Brief)\n\nAlthough Fed officials have been more hawkish in their long-term interest rate forecasts, and no one has explicitly endorsed a rate cut next year. But that won\u2019t stopped many in the market from betting against the Fed.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/na2n8fubwv2a1.png?width=830&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f06ee5441d424f5a93ac6d13b786b94aa25a614\n\nA Wharton professor recently said he wouldn't be surprised if the Fed funds rate fell to 2% by the end of 2023.\n\nSo what does that mean? It would imply that if current interest rate markets are pricing in a rate hike above 5% by the middle of next year, the Fed would need to cut rates by a cumulative 300 basis points over the next four meetings in the second half of next year -- 75 basis points at each.\n\n**Does that sound crazy?**\n\nYes, but it's such a crazy thing that some people are betting big on the options market right now.\n\nAs early as last Friday, some market insider noticed that one of the standout trades of the day was the purchase of a string of secured Overnight Funding rate (SOFR) futures options expiring in September 2023, a bet that the Fed will make a big move to 2% rates next September!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qluz5ufgwv2a1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1ad25176fc4b3a7d3419aed016454347b2ebef8\n\nAnd this week, rather than letting up, such bets have become more common, with more traders piling into positions that can benefit from a sharp turn in monetary policy by the Fed. The trades involved SOFR futures options with multiple maturities in the next two years.\n\nThe most active of these trades is the call spread structure at 97.00 and 98.00 strike prices, corresponding to the policy rate of 3% and 2% respectively.\n\nWhat was new on Tuesday was buying for the December 2023 contract, which preliminary CME open interest data indicated was newly opened trade. In terms of volume, the September 2023, December 2023 and March 2024 contracts each added about 50,000 options positions, for a combined value of about $35m.\n\nMany investors may wonder why these speculators dared to bet that the Fed would suddenly turn to aggressive rate cuts in the second half of next year. Who gave them the courage to make such an aggressive bet?\n\nWhile the option buyers couldn't be interviewed, fundamental logic suggests that similar bets on rate cuts aren't entirely misplaced. A key reason is that there is a real risk of a recession in the second half of next year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Even the Fed itself cannot deny this.**\n\nThe Fed's own economists estimate that the odds of a recession in the United States next year have risen to nearly 50% because of slowing consumer spending, global economic risks and the risk of further interest rate hikes, according to minutes of the Fed's meeting released Wednesday. It was the first such warning since the Fed began raising rates in March.\n\nIn March, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell pointed to a curve between three-month yields and three-month yields 18 months out, saying it had 100% explanatory power for the economic outlook. At one point, he made it clear that if the curve were inverted, that would mean the Fed would cut rates because the economy was weakening. On last Thursday, it inverted for the first time since the global financial crisis.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rgq5anjtwv2a1.png?width=776&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d378a1a5008452f343353be53994d93ca1edde4\n\nBeyond the threat of recession itself, there are plenty of other reasons why the Fed could cut rates in the second half of next year. For example, historically, when the Fed reaches its terminal rate (currently priced at around 4.90% by the middle of next year), the first cut in the next easing cycle usually comes a few months later.", "id": "z7sx6f", "created_utc": 1669725468.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "IMO, only way to cut it down to that level with that time duration is thru recession.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Recession is the goal, the only way it gets to that level by then is if something breaks so badly during it we start seeing deflation.
