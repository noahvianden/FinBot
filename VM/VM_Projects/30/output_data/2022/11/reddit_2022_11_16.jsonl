{"title": "Confused about the benefits of delta hedging", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI decided to try delta hedging to see what it feels like doing the same thing market makers are doing as I've been told. I decided to adjust delta position once per day (every 24 hours). Let me jump straight into the exact trades I did.\n\n1. I started by selling 1x AFRM Nov18'22 17 PUT on Monday (Nov 14) around 2 PM and got $1.10 worth of premium. At the moment I sold it, the delta was 0.56, so to delta hedge, I also shorted 56 AFRM shares at the price of $16.74.\n\n2. On Tuesday, AFRM went up 12%. At around 2 PM, I decided to follow through with my experiment and adjust delta. Delta on the put I sold was now 0.35 so I figure that I need to close 21 short shares (from 56 to 35) to stay delta neutral. At around 2 PM on Tuesday, AFRM was $17.80 so I booked in a loss of (-16.74 + 17.80)\\*21 = $22.26. While the put I sold was green, I figured that I need to lower my delta exposure on the short position because if AFRM kept going up, I'd be in trouble.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fh6npp2cyd0a1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9a40960656f76d162b817e1a115786954955b27\n\n3. On Wednesday at 2 PM, AFRM was down compared to 24 hours ago. The delta on my short put position was 0.84. To stay delta neutral, I figured I need to increase my short position again going from -35 AFRM shares to -84 AFRM shares. The extra 49 short shares were sold at the price of $15.05.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/92xcrt98zd0a1.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=9adb7c81b22e0b95008e1a8c74480f7d60a08253\n\nWhile I'm planning to run my experiment until Friday, I'm confused how does delta hedging benefit anyone at all? It seems to me that you need to book losses on your short position, when the stock goes up, while you keep re-entering the short stock position when the stock goes down. Say AFRM just oscillates between $16.50 and $18.00 for a few days, it would mean I would be adjusting delta every day, and pretty much book losses on every day from adjusting. Someone might argue that market makers adjust their delta by the hour or the minute, but even in that case, the problem still stays - if stock goes up, down, up, down: you would constantly book losses as you adjust your delta hedge.\n\nMy question is, how do market makers delta hedge and how does it benefit them?\n\nThank you in advance.", "id": "yx82mm", "created_utc": 1668637011.0, "score": 57, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "You need to do way more research before hopping into advanced things like this.\n\nDelta hedging does not have a \u201cbenefit\u201d. Delta hedging is a means to achieve a specific goal for Market Makers and those making bets against an option\u2019s theo IV.\n\nYou were delta-hedging without even having a forecast of IV or looking at the IV of the option you sold beforehand. So you missed the entire point of delta-hedging.\n\nDelta-hedging is used when you believe that an option on the market has a wrongly quoted IV. So you bet against it and make a forecast on the realized vol of the stock. If the option has a lower IV then your theo IV, you buy the option and delta-hedge, if it has a higher IV than your theo, then you sell it and delta-hedge.\n\nIn your example you sold the option and d-hedged. You\u2019d profit only it the theta outweighs gamma. Aka if realized volatility is lower than the volatility implied at the time you sold the option contract. If the stock moves around too much your losses from constantly re-hedging (gamma) will be bigger than the premium (theta) you received.\n\nMost of the time, only Market Makers delta hedge because they are managing an inventory of options and profit from the bid-ask spread where they buy below/sell above their implied vol theo.\n\nYou will lose a lot of money employing strategies if you have not researched them comprehensively.", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "Wow lemme just say, I\u2019m mind fucked by the op and your post\n\nVery fascinating and ego crushing.

{"title": "The Recession has already happened, and you missed it - Part 2", "selftext": " \n\nOriginal here: [The Recession has already happened, and you missed it : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ye7mnq/the_recession_has_already_happened_and_you_missed/)\n\n21 days ago I predicted a positive GDP report for Q3. That's not very impressive, I was going by the Atlanta Fed GDP Now forecast, predicting something happening the next day.\n\nToday I'm just summarizing how indicators are pointing more strongly towards stronger real economic growth for the short and medium term future. I'm also gonna summarize some shit that doesn't matter that people keep bringing up for some reason.\n\nFirst up, the current Atlanta Fed GDP Now forecast for Q4 is currently 4.4% [GDPNow - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (atlantafed.org)](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow)\n\nThis is really good. 4% real growth is what we get during boom times, like the 90s. For 2 decades 2% has been the norm. Now the annual number is going to be lower, because of Q1 and Q2 being negative, but we're looking forward here. Solid growth in the second half of 2022 is basically baked in right now.\n\nIn my first post I pointed out that since 2021 we've had a massive decline in federal government spending and theorized that this was basically the driver of the negative GDP growth we saw in Q1 and Q2. I said that the decline in GDP would halt as federal spending flatlines around its current level. The strong projection for GDP in Q4 is evidence that this is true.\n\nFinally, inflation. Obviously, the big news is several reports coming in lower than expected. If inflation has peaked, then we are likely through the worst of the rate hikes. I doubt the Fed reverses course immediately, but they won't need to crank rates up by 3/4 of a point every meeting anymore. We've come down from 9.1% in June to 7.7% in Oct. If that continues, inflation will be in the 3-4% range in one year.\n\nSo more of the same. I expect growth to remain positive, inflation to flatline or come down, and the pace of rate hikes to slow. Keep in mind, this growth is happening while the Fed hikes are going on. If the hikes stop or reverse even slightly, growth picks up more.\n\nFinally I'm gonna just run through a couple things that don't matter:\n\n1. Headlines about layoffs. Millions of people lose and gain jobs every month. The net number in the monthly jobs report tells us how the job market is doing. As long as that's positive, we're golden. Quit pointing to \"Zuck fired 10k people\" as justification for being bearish when the last jobs report was +261k. No it's not the beginning of a trend, it's confirmation bias and you fell for it.\n2. Midterms. Holy crap people, unless the person saying midterms will impact something has solid historical data backing them up, ignore them. They are just partisans trying to construct a narrative. Especially the heads I win, tails you lose \"predictions.\" If someone is arguing the market will crash if their side loses, and also it'll crash if their side wins but it'll still be the other sides' fault somehow, ignore them. Jeez.\n3. The numbers being fake. No one cares how inflation was calculated in 1970. Unless the inflation calculation changed between June and Oct of this year, it doesn't matter in the context of talking about the current inflation rate. Please find something else to talk about.\n\nPositions: 3X SPY and 3X TLT.", "id": "yx2l1b", "created_utc": 1668625079.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.53, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|46|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yx2l1b)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yx2l1b)\n\nCheck out the [WSB Discord](https://discord.gg/Y6Zw9ZKYdx)\n    \n>TL;DR: The recession has already happened and you missed it.

{"title": "Confused about the benefits of delta hedging", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI decided to try delta hedging to see what it feels like doing the same thing market makers are doing as I've been told. I decided to adjust delta position once per day (every 24 hours). Let me jump straight into the exact trades I did.\n\n1. I started by selling 1x AFRM Nov18'22 17 PUT on Monday (Nov 14) around 2 PM and got $1.10 worth of premium. At the moment I sold it, the delta was 0.56, so to delta hedge, I also shorted 56 AFRM shares at the price of $16.74.\n\n2. On Tuesday, AFRM went up 12%. At around 2 PM, I decided to follow through with my experiment and adjust delta. Delta on the put I sold was now 0.35 so I figure that I need to close 21 short shares (from 56 to 35) to stay delta neutral. At around 2 PM on Tuesday, AFRM was $17.80 so I booked in a loss of (-16.74 + 17.80)\\*21 = $22.26. While the put I sold was green, I figured that I need to lower my delta exposure on the short position because if AFRM kept going up, I'd be in trouble.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fh6npp2cyd0a1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9a40960656f76d162b817e1a115786954955b27\n\n3. On Wednesday at 2 PM, AFRM was down compared to 24 hours ago. The delta on my short put position was 0.84. To stay delta neutral, I figured I need to increase my short position again going from -35 AFRM shares to -84 AFRM shares. The extra 49 short shares were sold at the price of $15.05.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/92xcrt98zd0a1.png?width=668&format=png&auto=webp&s=9adb7c81b22e0b95008e1a8c74480f7d60a08253\n\nWhile I'm planning to run my experiment until Friday, I'm confused how does delta hedging benefit anyone at all? It seems to me that you need to book losses on your short position, when the stock goes up, while you keep re-entering the short stock position when the stock goes down. Say AFRM just oscillates between $16.50 and $18.00 for a few days, it would mean I would be adjusting delta every day, and pretty much book losses on every day from adjusting. Someone might argue that market makers adjust their delta by the hour or the minute, but even in that case, the problem still stays - if stock goes up, down, up, down: you would constantly book losses as you adjust your delta hedge.\n\nMy question is, how do market makers delta hedge and how does it benefit them?\n\nThank you in advance.", "id": "yx82mm", "created_utc": 1668637011.0, "score": 57, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "You need to do way more research before hopping into advanced things like this.\n\nDelta hedging does not have a \u201cbenefit\u201d.

So you missed the entire point of delta-hedging.\n\nDelta-hedging is used when you believe that an option on the market has a wrongly quoted IV. So you bet against it and make a forecast on the realized vol of the stock. If the option has a lower IV then your theo IV, you buy the option and delta-hedge, if it has a higher IV than your theo, then you sell it and delta-hedge.\n\nIn your example you sold the option and d-hedged. You\u2019d profit only it the theta outweighs gamma. Aka if realized volatility is lower than the volatility implied at the time you sold the option contract. If the stock moves around too much your losses from constantly re-hedging (gamma) will be bigger than the premium (theta) you received.\n\nMost of the time, only Market Makers delta hedge because they are managing an inventory of options and profit from the bid-ask spread where they buy below/sell above their implied vol theo.\n\nYou will lose a lot of money employing strategies if you have not researched them comprehensively.", "score": 66, "replies": [{"body": "Wow lemme just say, I\u2019m mind fucked by the op and your post\n\nVery fascinating and ego crushing.

{"title": "The Recession has already happened, and you missed it - Part 2", "selftext": " \n\nOriginal here: [The Recession has already happened, and you missed it : wallstreetbets (reddit.com)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ye7mnq/the_recession_has_already_happened_and_you_missed/)\n\n21 days ago I predicted a positive GDP report for Q3. That's not very impressive, I was going by the Atlanta Fed GDP Now forecast, predicting something happening the next day.\n\nToday I'm just summarizing how indicators are pointing more strongly towards stronger real economic growth for the short and medium term future. I'm also gonna summarize some shit that doesn't matter that people keep bringing up for some reason.\n\nFirst up, the current Atlanta Fed GDP Now forecast for Q4 is currently 4.4% [GDPNow - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (atlantafed.org)](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow)\n\nThis is really good. 4% real growth is what we get during boom times, like the 90s. For 2 decades 2% has been the norm. Now the annual number is going to be lower, because of Q1 and Q2 being negative, but we're looking forward here. Solid growth in the second half of 2022 is basically baked in right now.\n\nIn my first post I pointed out that since 2021 we've had a massive decline in federal government spending and theorized that this was basically the driver of the negative GDP growth we saw in Q1 and Q2. I said that the decline in GDP would halt as federal spending flatlines around its current level. The strong projection for GDP in Q4 is evidence that this is true.\n\nFinally, inflation. Obviously, the big news is several reports coming in lower than expected. If inflation has peaked, then we are likely through the worst of the rate hikes. I doubt the Fed reverses course immediately, but they won't need to crank rates up by 3/4 of a point every meeting anymore. We've come down from 9.1% in June to 7.7% in Oct. If that continues, inflation will be in the 3-4% range in one year.\n\nSo more of the same. I expect growth to remain positive, inflation to flatline or come down, and the pace of rate hikes to slow. Keep in mind, this growth is happening while the Fed hikes are going on. If the hikes stop or reverse even slightly, growth picks up more.\n\nFinally I'm gonna just run through a couple things that don't matter:\n\n1. Headlines about layoffs. Millions of people lose and gain jobs every month. The net number in the monthly jobs report tells us how the job market is doing. As long as that's positive, we're golden. Quit pointing to \"Zuck fired 10k people\" as justification for being bearish when the last jobs report was +261k. No it's not the beginning of a trend, it's confirmation bias and you fell for it.\n2. Midterms. Holy crap people, unless the person saying midterms will impact something has solid historical data backing them up, ignore them. They are just partisans trying to construct a narrative. Especially the heads I win, tails you lose \"predictions.\" If someone is arguing the market will crash if their side loses, and also it'll crash if their side wins but it'll still be the other sides' fault somehow, ignore them. Jeez.\n3. The numbers being fake. No one cares how inflation was calculated in 1970. Unless the inflation calculation changed between June and Oct of this year, it doesn't matter in the context of talking about the current inflation rate. Please find something else to talk about.\n\nPositions: 3X SPY and 3X TLT.", "id": "yx2l1b", "created_utc": 1668625079.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.53, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|46|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yx2l1b)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yx2l1b)\n\nCheck out the [WSB Discord](https://discord.gg/Y6Zw9ZKYdx)\n    \n>TL;DR: The recession has already happened and you missed it.
