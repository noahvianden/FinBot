{"title": "The VIX is Broken. Here's what comes next.", "selftext": "Anyone who has been following the VIX knows that it's not acting normal right now.\n\nSince markets bottomed in March 2009, the S&P 500 and the VIX have consistently maintained an inverse correlation, with the volatility index typically drifting steadily lower as equities powered to new highs (think 2017, when the VIX fell into single digits amid steady stock market gains) while bouts of volatility and short-lived selloffs in the stock market saw the VIX spike higher. Digging into this relationship deeper, when stocks made new meaningful lows below exceptional support levels, the VIX would almost always rise to new highs beyond those that corresponded with the previous lows in stocks.\u00a0\n\nFor example, as the S&P 500 (SPX) dropped below the lows from late 2018 (2,346) during the Q1 \u201920 Covid-19 crash, which carried the index down to 2,191, the VIX blasted through the late-2018 high of 36.20 and peaked at a staggering 85.47. The uncertainty associated with the first pandemic in 100 years certainly amplified the move higher in the VIX in that example, but it does illustrate the point of the traditional inverse correlation between stocks and the VIX very well.\n\nNow, the actual formula and process used to calculate the VIX is very complex and involves some high-level math, but in the simplest terms, the index measures price activity, mainly demand, in the options market. That is why in normal market conditions, the VIX rises amid increasing demand for puts as the broader stock market declines, and this is also the reason it is often referred to as the market's \u201cfear gauge.\u201d\n\nBut at both of the most recent major market peaks that occurred in 2000 and then again in 2007/2008, that historically consistent inverse correlation between the stock market and the VIX broke down as new meaningful lows in the S&P 500 were not met with new highs in the VIX. And it has happened again this year.\u00a0\n\n**The logical question to ask here is: why would this happen?**\n\nAs stocks make new meaningful lows, as they first did in February, then again in May and June of this year, sophisticated investors were actually liquidating long-term, long equity positions as opposed to holding those positions and just adding hedges to manage risk and downside exposure.\n\nSo, what we are seeing in the VIX and the S&P 500 right now is the same thing we saw in both 2000/2001 and 2007/2008 in the early stages of those respective bear markets. And the bad news is that this dynamic only persists during the \u201cdistribution phase\u201d of market cycles when sophisticated investors are liquidating to retail investors attempting to \u201cbuy one more dip.\u201d Once the VIX finally breaks the downtrend of \u201clower highs\u201d and begins to move meaningfully higher, the real breakdown and capitulation in stocks begin.\n\nLooking at the dot-com bubble, the downtrend in the VIX was broken in September 2001, and the S&P 500 proceeded to decline another 30% or so, as the VIX ripped higher, finally bottoming in late 2002. During the financial crisis, the VIX downtrend was not broken until September 2008, and the S&P 500 fell another 47% to the March 2009 lows (of course, the VIX ripped higher as well).\n\n **TL;DR:** The VIX isn't acting normal right now because institutional investors are selling their long positions in stocks, instead of just hedging them. This is a bearish sign that indicates the bottom is not yet in and that the market still has further to fall. \n\n[Not a perfect downtrend but we're still in the process of lower highs since January.  It fits the pattern of 2001\\/2002 and 2007\\/2008.](https://preview.redd.it/40naqh9jzi1a1.png?width=2500&format=png&auto=webp&s=cfeb71a5a72ae0f6a2ba4ca08be492e9bc994297)", "id": "z1xb4p", "created_utc": 1669133004.0, "score": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "I think the VIX is behaving exactly it\u2019s supposed to, this is a controlled sell off and not a widespread panic(like the covid crash).

{"title": "Best Buy shares rise 10% as retailer sticks with its holiday-quarter outlook", "selftext": "* **Best Buy reported quarterly results that topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations.**\n* **The retailer stuck to its holiday-quarter outlook as electronics demand held up.**\n* **Comparable sales fell by less than Best Buy\u2019s own projections.**\n\nBest Buy on Tuesday surpassed Wall Street\u2019s expectations for quarterly earnings, as inflation-dented demand for pricey consumer electronics came in better than feared.\n\nThe consumer electronics retailer, which had cut its forecast this summer, reiterated its outlook for the holiday quarter. It raised its full-year forecast to reflect the beat, saying it expects comparable sales to decline about 10%.\n\nShares of the company rose more than 10% on Tuesday. The stock is trading around $78 after hitting a 52-week low of $60.78 in October.\n\nHere\u2019s how the retailer did for the three-month period ended Oct. 29 compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, according to a survey of analysts by Refinitiv:\n\n* **Earnings per share**: $1.38 adjusted vs. $1.03 expected\n* **Revenue**: $10.59 billion vs. $10.31 billion expected\n\nWhile Best Buy\u2019s quarterly results were better than expected, demand is down from the heights of the pandemic, when consumers turned to its stores for home theaters, computer monitors, kitchen appliances and more while working, playing and cooking at home.\n\nNet sales for the fiscal third quarter declined by about 11% from $11.91 billion year over year in the third quarter. Net income fell to $277 million, or $1.22 per share, from $499 million, or $2 per share, a year earlier.\n\nOn a call with investors, CEO Corie Barry said sales declined across most of Best Buy\u2019s product categories \u2014 with the largest decrease in computing and home theater. However, she said, compared to the same quarter in 2019, its computing revenue is 23% higher and its appliances revenue remains 37% higher.\n\nEven as consumers paid more for groceries, gas and housing, she said the retailer \u201csaw relatively consistent behavior from our purchasing customers.\u201d But she added shoppers have a lot of interest in sales events.\n\n\u201cAcross consumers we can also see that savings are being drawn down and credit usage is going up,\u201d Barry said on the investor call. \u201cAnd value clearly matters to everyone.\u201d\n\nBest Buy is staring down a more uncertain sales environment this holiday season. Some inflation-pinched consumers are pulling back on discretionary items and spending more money on necessities and experiences. The company joined other retailers in slashing its outlook this summer. It said at the time that it expects same-store sales to drop by about 11% for the 12-month period ending in January.\n\nA month after Best Buy warned of slower sales, it cut jobs across the country.\n\nYet, so far, the company has topped its own expectations.\n\nComparable sales fell by 10.4%, less of a decline than the 12.9% that analysts expected, according to FactSet. The key metric, also called same-store sales, tracks sales online and at stores open at least 14 months.\n\nIt was also less of a drop than the retailer anticipated. Best Buy had not given specific guidance for comparable sales in the third-quarter, but its Chief Financial Officer Matt Bilunas had cautioned it would drop more than the 12.1% decline in the second quarter. \n\nThe company said it has resumed share buybacks, which it paused when it took down its forecast in July. Best Buy said it plans to spend about $1 billion on share buybacks this year.\n\nBest Buy, however, is still seeing inflation change shopping patterns. On a call with reporters, Barry said some lower-income consumers have opted for less-expensive TVs. On the other hand, she said, some wealthier consumers are picking premium products and trading up to laptops with more features when replacing them.\n\nAs the level of promotions picks up, CEO Barry said the company is tightly controlling its inventory, which was down 14.7% year over year. The retailer anticipated a decline in demand and lapped a year-ago period when shipments arrived both early and late because of a supply chain challenges.\n\nInventory has been a closely watched metric in the retail industry, as many companies cope with a glut of unwanted goods and have had to mark down items, cancel orders or pack and store goods.\n\nBarry said on an investor call that holiday shopping patterns are also shifting to a more typical pre-pandemic pattern. She said the retailer expects customers to spend more during Black Friday, Cyber Monday and the two weeks leading up to Christmas.\n\nShares of Best Buy are down about 30% so far this year, underperforming the S&P 500 Index. Shares closed on Monday at $70.83, down nearly 2%. The company\u2019s market value is $15.95 billion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/22/best-buy-bby-earnings-q3-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/22/best-buy-bby-earnings-q3-2023.html)", "id": "z1x8re", "created_utc": 1669132851.0, "score": 216, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "A consumer discretionary retailer with overly rosy guidance?\n\nThis isn't going to end well, at least puts are cheap now.", "score": 58, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5931161046028137}, {"body": "Hope is cute.", "score": 25, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06974449753761292}, {"body": "We cut the guidance, we sell the stock, companies barely beat the excessively reduced guidance, we buy the stock. \n\nSame stores sales are down in every single category, Margins are lower to move excess inventory, but its all rainbows", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "It\u2019s not about good vs bad, it\u2019s about better or worse than market expectations.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "The \u201cmarket expectations\u201d are whatever these companies want them to be.
