{"title": "Why do people pretend they know what's going on?", "selftext": "Sure, stock is down, some crashing hard, but yet many people seem to be having some strong opinions on whether not the bottom is in, or a bigger crash is coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut in reality, nobody knows. Indeed, if there was a stronger consensus on how stock should get lower, more people would've cashed out and stocks will be selling at those levels already. Contrarily, if there was stronger consensus on how stock is going to rebound, many people would have bought in fear of missing out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis uncertainty is exactly the reason why stock is low now, the opinions are priced in. Sure you think there's a strong rebound? call options have a high premium for that gamble. Sure you think stock will tank? put options aren't cheap either. Plus, none of us retail investors are experts, and we likely have far less information than wall street pros and analysts. So how can we know when something is really priced in?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen news come out that is slightly better than the institutions expected, they might come in and buy, stock goes up. Same thing for when news is slightly worse, then stock goes down. Without us knowing all those information, how can retail investors possibly predict? Inflation or not, stock up and down or not, these are all public information, and the price already reflects all that. But what happens the next day, is anyone's guess.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only truth I can think of, is the fundamental asymmetry of stock performance. While stock can go down, and $100 can go down to 0$, it can technically go up without bound. So ignoring emotion, what's worse? losing half of a stock value, $50, or missing out on doubling on stock value $100? In the end, that's why time in the market beats timing the market. If I tell you stock will likely say 3x eventually, isn't it better to stay invested and guarantee those eventual gains versus getting out and saving a smaller 1x loss?", "id": "unp4xi", "created_utc": 1652318319.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "Welcome to r/stocks!\n\nFor beginner advice, brokerage info, book recommendations, even advanced topics and more, please read our [Wiki here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index)\n\nIf you're wondering **why a stock moved** a certain way, check out [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) which aggregates the most news for almost every stock, but also see [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/), and even [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/).\n\nPlease direct all simple questions towards the stickied Daily Discussion and Quarterly Rate My Portfolio threads (sort by Hot, they're at the top).\n\nAlso include *some* [due diligence](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/duediligence.asp) to this post or it may be removed if it's low effort.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

{"title": "the market always goes down", "selftext": "\n\nSome people will tell you that the market always goes up. But they base this on the misleading data from the very beginning of the stock market to over 100 years later. And that's a misleading statistic because a lot of economic things happened during that time that affected the stock market. But it doesn't necessarily mean that the stock market always goes up\n\nFor example if you bought into the stock market in 2003 then by 2010 you would still be in the red\n\nAnd there's a lot of other times were you can pick data points and compare them to later datapoints and see that you would be down from where you were. The basic rule of the market is that it always goes down. It doesn't matter when you buy into the market. Pick any random day and put money in the market. Guaranteed that within one week and at the most two weeks Your Position will be lower than what you bought into it for. Sure maybe eventually it will become higher but in the short-term it will always go down. Without fail. It NEVER goes up short term\n\nto prove  this in 2021 I shorted   one share of the snp500. Just one. And then I watched the Returns on that single shorted share..\n\nWhat did I see? The exception of a very short time span in which it went into the red (aka the S&amp;P 500 was worth more than what I bought it for) most of the time it was in the green. Meaning the vast majority of the time of having that shorted share I had actually made money \n\nAnd this isn't unique to the S P 500. It's most stocks. No matter when you buy into them at least in the short-term they're going to go down. They will ALWAYS go down\n\n\nwethe you bought Apple in October of 2020 or whether you bought Tesla in 2020 just to see if crater down to 700 for months on end\n\nThe market always goes down. If you bought into the market in March 2021 you're in the red\n\nwhy? because the market always goes down\n\nSo you can buy into stocks and hope Beyond hope that over the course of many many years they will gradually trickle up to maybe a 10% gain. Or you can recognize that within the shorter-term you they will go down by 20 and 30% easily", "id": "uo99cz", "created_utc": 1652384481.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.52, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|12 seconds ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|9 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uo99cz)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uo99cz)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.026338422670960426}, {"body": "This is especially retarded", "score": 102, "replies": [{"body": "The most retarded thing I\u2019ve read all week, and I just discovered the research chemicals sub this week so that\u2019s saying something.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "Ahhhhh analogs", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05164416879415512}, {"body": "Link to the research chemicals sub?

Instead, you should perhaps be asking, \u201cWhat should I not do?\u201d\n\n>The answer is simple: Don\u2019t panic. Panic buying is often people\u2019s gut reaction when stocks are rising and there\u2019s a drastic increase in the value of their portfolios. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to know beforehand your risk tolerance and how price fluctuations\u2014or volatility\u2014will affect you. You can also mitigate market risk by hedging your portfolio through diversification\u2014holding a variety of investments including some that have a low degree of correlation with the stock market.\n\n>Investing helps you safeguard your retirement, put your savings to their most efficient use, and grow your wealth through the magic of compounding. Why, then, do 44% of Americans not invest in the stock market, according to a July 2021 Gallup survey?1 Gallup posits that the reason is a lack of confidence in the market due to the 2008 financial crisis and the considerable market volatility of the past year. Additionally, those without sufficient savings to get by month-to-month generally don't have money to invest in the market either.\n\n>From 2001 to 2008, an average 62% of U.S. adults said they owned stock\u2014a level never reached since, according to Gallup. A stock market decline, due to a recession or an exogenous event like the COVID-19 pandemic, can put core investing tenets, such as risk tolerance and diversification, to the test. It\u2019s important to remember that the market is cyclical and stocks going up are inevitable. But an upturn is temporary. It\u2019s wiser to think long-term instead of panic buying when stock prices are at their highs.\n\n>After all, the stock market always goes down.\n\n/s", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["recession"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "CNBC guy says more to go on downside for NASDAQ  Not buying today.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "short spy", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2068241536617279}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.44031867384910583}, {"body": "\ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.03547780588269234}, {"body": "Hey man!
