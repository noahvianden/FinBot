To make it even more bull shit, the listed address is also associated with [The Benchmark Company, LLC.](https://opencorpdata.com/lei/254900WNB33E53292541)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sik7l1d2ac091.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba40c2dd9a91dbab32f7b2791c6a13a53ce2fb06\n\nSome more deep diving lead to finding [former names of The Benchmark Company, LLC](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/836902/999999999722001633/9999999997-22-001633.txt). Looking up some of those older names led to the discovery of another [Benchmark's homepage](http://www.benchmark.com/) that has the same format as the shitty Perry Creek site. Furthermore, just like the Perry Creek site, Benchmark also literally has nothing else but the logo and contact information.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e8g5waz2ac091.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=a585dbfca9e2d0f11ff6ee7af2ec70aaa4f08205\n\n# Why The Shit Attempt at Hiding Benchmark?\n\n[In 2009, Benchmark was one of the earlier investors of Twitter. Benchmark later invested $11 million into Uber in 2011.](https://www.investopedia.com/news/biggest-winners-uber-ipo/#:~:text=Benchmark%20Capital%20was%20also%20an,his%20battles%20with%20local%20governments) In 2016, Uber underwent a restructuring of board members, but the veteran Uber members were not able to agree completely with Benchmark's organizational proposal. Thus, [in 2017, Benchmark sued former Uber CEO, Travis Kalanick](https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/10/benchmark-sues-former-uber-ceo-travis-kalanick/) accusing him of fraud, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty.\n\nSince the ultimate goal is for Uber which is owned by the Saudi Prince Alwaleed to join forces again with Benchmark aka Perry (a Waymo investor), it would look REALLY suss if the company that sued Uber was later also a partner. So the quick and lazy PR solution is to make up a name without even trying to cover it up.\n\n# The Fight for Vehicular Autonomy\n\nIn 2013, Alphabet was also an early investor into Uber and placed a $250 million stake into the company. Uber and Alphabet began to become competitive against one another as they both were developing self-driving vehicles. The rivalry eventually got really heated. [Alphabet later sued Uber in 2017 claiming Uber stole trade secrets when it acquired a self-driving tech start-up by another former Google executive, Anthony Levandowski.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/11/alphabet-uber-investment-stake-has-gone-up-20x-since-2013.html)\n\nGoogle was still a pro and able to keep up other huge business ventures. [During this ongoing litigation, Alphabet's investing arm, CapitalG, invested $500 million in Lyft in October 2017.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/29/alphabet-has-more-than-doubled-its-money-on-lyft.html) This stake resulted in Alphabet becoming the 5th biggest outside investor in Lyft. Other significant investors are Fidelity and  Andreessen Horowitz.\n\n*Look at that! We see Fidelity and Andreessen Horowitz again!!!*\n\n[In March 2019, Uber acquires Careem.](https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/technology/uber-acquires-mideast-competitor-careem-for-3-1-billion-229684/) Careem investors include Saudi Technology Ventures and Kingdom Holding Company (KHC), chaired by Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund had a $3.5 billion stake in the ride-sharing app. KHC alreaddy holds significant stakes in both Uber and Lyft\n\n# Convincing the Royals to Bring in Royalties\n\n[Saudi Prince Alwaleed is currently one of the largest Twitter shareholders and has tweeted he will vote to reject Elon Musk's bid for the company](https://nypost.com/2022/04/14/saudi-prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-rejects-elon-musks-twitter-takeover-bid/).

{"title": "BUY BUY BUY GROWTH! (From the guy who said sell)", "selftext": "Hello gang, like thrush I\u2019m back.\n\n**Previous Update Posts**\n\n* September 28 2021: [The Great Market Wheeze is almost upon us](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/pwvway/the_great_market_wheeze_is_almost_upon_us/)\n* February 22 2022: [I told you so\u2026 The Great Wheeze is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/sygjdx/my_prediction_was_correct_the_great_wheeze_is_here/)\n\nAs I predicted in September last year: inflation would be elevated, bond yields would go up and stock yields would have to go up (prices come down). Markets weren\u2019t \u201cpricing this in\u201d because you cannot price in excess or draining liquidity, liquidity is the tide all ships rest on. I predicted this would happen in a cascade of sectors which it has, starting with hypergrowth and then spreading, like thrush. I predicted growth would get oversold.\n\nAlso for the record, I'm up 11% for the year and was up 26% last year. Not a perma-bear who sits in Peter Schiff stocks. Read on and learn what will happen next and how to actually make some money. Or don't. Don't care.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# > Grading My Predictions\n\nIn February 2022 I created a bingo board of the future. For the record, I count shortish as 3-6 months, middish like 6-18 and longterm beyond that. How did I go, I've marked actual performance:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jqzinsi3mf091.png?width=2231&format=png&auto=webp&s=72221d0f1432f3beaf4082e770d0060b34f4a8c6\n\nI was mostly right with relative performance between assets. Everything's down because of Russia/Ukraine war which I definitely didn\u2019t see coming, hence not foreseeing the massive spike in oil prices which jacked commodities. Rather be in $VIG at -6% than $ARKK at -35% though. I thought things wouldn\u2019t be this extreme and happen this fast. Putin hit the gas peddle.\n\nI only speak with complete confidence because people don\u2019t pay attention otherwise. But at the end of the day, as magical as my market abilities appear I'm just a man, or a woman, or a cat, or an ape\u2026 you just never know do you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# > What Will Play Out This Year\n\nPeople don't get that the factors that affect stocks on an *individual* level aren't what effect on the *macro* level. Factors like profitability/growth are great to determine the value of stock A vs stock B. But overall cash is king baby. Liquidity flowing in and out determine overall asset values. Which is why the Fed who controls the printer determines everything.\n\nThe Fed is currently jawboning markets down to cool inflation without having to actually jack interest rates up. This is because they can't for an extended period of time. The US government has too much debt to afford large repayments. Furthermore it will become difficult to complete treasury auctions when the fed is selling not buying.\n\n**The Fed doesn't want to kill stocks**, Powell loves the stock market.\n\nIn practicality his purpose is to keep debt borrowing costs as low as possible for the US government. This boosts stocks as stock's earnings yields sit a bit above the risk free rate of treasuries i.e. if treasuries pay 2% (50 PE) stocks might yield 4% (25 PE). Whereas if treasuries sit at 5% (20 PE), stocks have to sit at 8% (12.5 PE). Halving the stock price.\n\nThis Fed has constantly erred on the side of accommodative, they cut rates in 2019 when there was barely an excuse. They will literally jump on any excuse to drop rates and print print print. The only time they cannot do this is when inflation is so out of control it's pissing people off. They're not different people now, they just are talking different.\n\n**Powell faces 4 dragons right now:**\n\n1. \ud83d\udc09 Post-covid supply bottlenecks,\n2. \ud83d\udc09 Elevated food/energy from Ukraine war\n3. \ud83d\udc09 Supply bottlenecks from China lockdown\n4. \ud83d\udc09 The inflationary echoes of the covid printing bender and stimmy checks.\n\nNotice something?\n\nAll 4 of those will resolve by themselves at some point. While we're not going to wind back the past inflation, we are on trajectory for it to come down. Last month on month reading was .3% or 3.7% annualized. Considering current events not bad. Many leading indicators I use are rolling over.\n\nInflation will remain elevated for a couple years because the Fed is half heartedly tightening with negative real yields and minor balance sheet reduction. But in order for inflation to keep going up, prices have to keep going up from their current elevated levels. In the near future the 4 dragons will begin to kill themselves and this will only help.\n\n**Therefore later this year I expect a softening from the Fed** after a few good inflation prints. This will cause a rally in stocks, not breaking all time highs but higher then now. It doesn't mean we're going back to the 20/21 era, the fed will not be going crazy like that again for a long time. But it's going to look a lot rosier then now.\n\nThis means **depression fears are also overblown**, the problem is valuation like the dot.com crash, not a liquidity crunch like 2008. We still have an extra $5t floating around on the feds balance sheet and negative real rates. Borrowing at 4% while inflation's at 9% is a good deal. We may have a technical recession given difficult short term economic events, but it will be mild and short lived.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# > How To Make Money\n\n**Big money is sitting in cash**, the money isn't gone and the cost of borrowing money is still below inflation - making margin loan expansion likely. This means at the first sign of clear skies later this year we're going to get a big rally as liquidity rushes back in.\n\nAs predicted **Hypergrowth is oversold** and there's quality names trading at attractive prices. This is the worst time to buy inflation or recession hedges as they're already overbought. Trade the cascade as sectors collapse one by one, buy what has collapsed, don't sit in what will collapse. Don't overpay.\n\nAs outlined in a past update, developed nations have no choice but to devalue their currency through persistently elevated inflation. Emerging markets really don't have our inflation problems for the most part since they didn't print. So **EM is about to have an era of outperformance** in stocks and bonds as it enjoys a greater share of global consumption.\n\nCalculating for inflation, real GDP growth and additional cash on the Fed balance sheet the **fair value for the S&P 500 is around 3800**. Anything below that is a steal considering I doubt we're going to have a major economic collapse.\n\nIn bear markets correlations become 1. Meaning everything falls in unison by sector, regardless of which companies are actual stand outs. There's too much going on for accurate pricing. When investors panic every bad event that could happen is more then priced in. I always try and buy on panic. **Incredible mispricing's are being created right now, buy them**.\n\nSo in short BUY BUY BUY GROWTH STOCKS. The good ones. Lots of these are absolute dogs haha.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# > What Stocks To Buy\n\nHere's my actual stock recommendations at this exact moment in markets. A lot of work has gone into these, not going to explain all the rationales, but these will do amazing over next few years. I hold a concentrated portfolio so I only ever have 5-10 of my best ideas at a time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Shopify ($SHOP)** \\- Anything below $300 is a steal. I started at $330, don't want to miss this one.\n* **Sartorius ($SRT.DE**)\n* **JinkoSolar ($JKS)** \\- Will double on a China rally. Not a huge fan of China so don't hold forever.\n* **Austal** ($ASB.AX)\n* **Emerging Market Local Currency Bond ETF** (**$EMLC)**\n* **India ETF ($INDA)**\n* **Indonesia ETF ($IDX)**", "id": "ut33zq", "created_utc": 1652965840.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.72, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|11|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|25|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/syfwrh/i_told_you_so_the_great_wheeze_is_here/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/syg5oe/i_told_you_so_the_great_wheeze_is_here/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/syfrhu/i_told_you_so_the_great_wheeze_is_here/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pwvrsi/the_great_market_wheeze_is_almost_upon_us/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ut305x/buy_buy_buy_growth_from_the_guy_who_said_sell/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ut33zq/buy_buy_buy_growth_from_the_guy_who_said_sell/) \n**Account Age**|7 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ut33zq)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ut33zq)\n    \nHey /u/ini0n, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5880558490753174}, {"body": "Are you for real?
