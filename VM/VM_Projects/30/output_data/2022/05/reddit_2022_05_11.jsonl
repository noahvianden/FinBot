{"title": "Trade Disney Earning with Iron Condor", "selftext": "**Overview**\n\n**The Walt Disney Company** is expected to report earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 on 05/11/2022 after market close.\n\nThe company expected revenues of **$20.04 billion**, indicating a 28.4% YOY **increase** and a 8.2% **drop** from the previous quarter. The company anticipated earnings per share of **$1.19**, indicating a 50.6% **increase** from the prior-year and a 12.3% **increase** from last quarter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Revenue vs. EPS](https://preview.redd.it/le950def0vy81.png?width=1249&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d34449200717b347276f9d125ea7ba77d6f7fcd)\n\n**Price Action**\n\nStock price of the Disney has been following the general market downtrend over the past few months. It was closed at $107.7 on May 10th, and rebounded 1.6% as of 11am May 11th. Recent put-call ratio has been hovering around 0.7-0.8, implying a slightly bearish post-earning sentiment.\n\n[Price Actions](https://preview.redd.it/4i4soq923vy81.png?width=458&format=png&auto=webp&s=8196c9d3b85af264fa815dcb4443495323aa015b)\n\n**Implied Volatility**\n\nGoing into the earnings, the IV has been expanding significantly primarily driven by the overall market selloff. The current IV rank (as of 05/10 after market close) is **100%**,  so is the IV percentile.  This means the current IV is at its 1 year peak. Therefore, a volatility crush strategy seems reasonable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Implied Volatility](https://preview.redd.it/vw5iltjp3vy81.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cf9a56a99f9f2bcc77e23edc1d23999ac86ba3f)\n\n**Implied vs. Actual Moves in the Past**\n\nDisney stock is priced at $109 at 11am on May 11th. The at-the-money straddle expired on May 13 is priced at $9.7. This means that the market expectation of the post-earning price move is between $109\u00b1 $9.7. This is known as the implied move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Implied vs. Actual Moves](https://preview.redd.it/0ldap3os4vy81.png?width=1361&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4a1c9fbb103baf7537a4ce7d4f6b53f1ba6a940)\n\nDuring the last 4 earnings, the actual moves by-and-large closed within the market expectations except for last November when Disney's reported EPS missed the analyst estimates by 23.4% and the revenue missed by 1.24%. The disappointed performance then was due to the slowing down of Disney+, its streaming business, while the theme park business was picking up. The Covid relief would continuously contribute to its Theme park business around the world except for Shanghai. Yet the disappointed earning announcement by Netflix raised the investors' concern around the performance of Disney+. The downward move post-earning move is still likely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Proposed Strategy: Short Iron Condor**\n\nMy proposed trade is a short iron condor strategy expired on May 13th\n\n**Enter**\n\nOn May 11th **before market close**, find out Disney's spot price, and the 05-13-22 at-the-money straddle cost to build the trade. **For example, if** the stock price then is $110 and straddle cost is $10 the iron condor can be built in the following way:\n\nStrike prices for the short legs are based on the implied moves:\n\nStep 1: Sell $100 (110-10) Put\n\nStep 2: Sell $120 (110+10) Call\n\nSelection of the strike prices for the long legs are based on my risk tolerance:\n\nStep 3: Buy $95 Put\n\nStep 4: Buy $125 Call\n\nExpiration date for all 4 contracts is May 13th, 2022. I choose $5 width spreads on both the call and put sides. The breakeven points at expiration date are $98.5 and $121.5. The total credit (max profit) collected from this trade is $150, and the max loss $350 ($5\\*100 - $150). The probability of profit of this trade is above 80%, which is considered as a high probability trade.\n\nThe current spread of $5 is based on my risk tolerance and is relatively small. With a smaller spread, the Greeks on the long and short are more similar, so you won't see much profit until the Greeks start to collapse much closer to expiration. For an earnings trade, you typically won't want to be holding them that long. You'll also see a favorable shift in your break evens, and POP with wider spreads. Yet a wider spread will also introduce higher max loss. Therefore it's up to you to choose spread size.\n\n**Exit**\n\nOn May 12th, if the trade is profited, **close all 4 positions** before market close to reduce the risk exposure for the rest of the week.\n\n**Caveats**\n\n\\- It is **NOT** recommended to hold the strategy through expiration even if the price looks safe. Gamma risk can be dangerous.\n\n\\- Exit after 50% profit is also a popular take-profit strategy.\n\n**Update 5-11 4:30pm**:  trade entered at 3:57pm.  Strikes: 90-95-115-120.  Credit collected: $144.  Max loss: $356.\n\n**Update 5-12 11:00am**: exited the trade with $30 debit.  Total profit $110.\n\nBy: [www.odds.trade](http://www.odds.trade)", "id": "unc70a", "created_utc": 1652282242.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "Decent trade.

{"title": "U.S. CPI beats expectations in April! U.S. stock futures plunge", "selftext": "Recently, the global capital market has been falling, and the Nasdaq index of the US stock market continued to hit a new low since the fall yesterday.\n\nThe three major U.S. stock indexes, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P, will fall by 30% or more from their highs, and now Nasdaq is fast. And Goldman Sachs recently released a report that the S&P index fell by 28%!\n\nThis round of stock market slump, the macro reasons, of course, is the Fed's interest rate hike. After experiencing the most violent water release cycle in history, the Federal Reserve has also ushered in the most violent interest rate hike cycle in history. It feels like it is witnessing history every year. At present, the market expects that interest rates will continue to be raised at every Fed meeting this year.\n\nThe rate hikes have severely pushed up U.S. Treasury yields, the anchor for global interest rates. At present, the yield of the 10-year US Treasury bond has exceeded 3%, and the yield of long-term and short-term Treasury bonds has also inverted. From experience, this is not only bad for the financial market, but also often a precursor to a recession in the real economy.\n\nIn addition, the bubble of the US stock market itself is also one of the internal reasons. If the US stock market adopts the valuation system of Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller, it is currently the second largest in history. At its high point, it was extremely close to the peak of the 2000 Internet bubble.\n\nFrom an industrial point of view, this round of decline is something that has never been encountered since the financial crisis in 2008, and that is the failure of technology giants. The five FAANG giants, which were once all-powerful, changed their name to META on Facebook, and gambled heavily on Yuan Universe, their profits almost halved, and the stock price fell by 48%. Amazon's e-commerce business posted a loss, falling 42%. The results of Google and Netflix also fell short of expectations by 25% and 75%, respectively.\n\nAt present, almost only Apple is still the only one. In the past, technology was the biggest driving force for the rise of US stocks. The top five technology companies alone contributed more than 30% of the index's rise. Now, the performance has peaked, and some large technology companies have even been cut in half, which can be called a double kill for Davis.\n\nEven so, the ceiling is about to appear, and Apple's revenue growth in the first quarter has dropped to single digits, only 9%. This growth rate is difficult to support a price-earnings ratio of 30 times in A shares, let alone in US stocks. The crash of tech stocks\n\nBest wishes to everyone!", "id": "un9gwr", "created_utc": 1652274525.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.56, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": ">U.S. CPI beats expectations in April! \n\n* [CPI is expected to rise 0.2% in April or 8.1% on an annualized basis](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/10/aprils-consumer-price-index-report-expected-to-show-inflation-has-already-peaked-.html)\n* [Inflation hit 8.3 percent in April compared to last year](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/inflation-numbers-april-2022-cpi-data-rcna28194)\n\nU.S CPI did not beat expectations in April", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "Experts predicted 8.1%, actual 8.3%", "score": -23, "replies": [{"body": "The way you worded it is weird.

Earnings are coming in strong, but prices are falling.\n\nTypically equities do really well during inflation. \n\nMakes sense, why would you want to hold cash when your cash is losing value so quickly.  Venezuelans who held stocks over the last 20 years instead of holding their local currency are certainly happy averaging 1000s of % every year  in their local money.\n\nThey also tend to not do this bad when interest rates are this low(they are still historically low), and aren\u2019t likely to reach anywhere close to 4%, which would still seem decently low for anyone who lived through 1965-2000.  \n\nSo what is causing the sell off?  \nAlmost every article I\u2019ve read believes that the market is selling because it is forward looking and believes the fed funds rate will reach 3%-3.5% by the end of 2022 alone.   Forget the fact that nobody actually knows how to perfectly \u201cprice in\u201d inflation, that\u2019s fucking ridiculous. \n\nThere are 5 more fed meetings and the current rate is 0.9%.  To reach 3% requires a 0.42% increase at every single meeting. \n\nSo, the market is convinced there is going to be a recession and they are getting ahead of it. Is the market ever wrong? Of course.  The market is sometimes wrong and sometimes right, which is why it makes sense when Buffet preaches to just buy good companies at good prices and hold through recessions for the long term. \n\nWhat if something else is adding to the sell off though?  \n\nThere are a few smart people out there who think Bill Hwang wasn\u2019t alone.  They believe that there are many funds who are way over leveraged and are under reporting their margin debt, which is illegal of course.    We all saw what Archegos\u2019 margin call did to stocks.  Imagine if that started happening to multiple funds one after the other?  \n\nWhen interest rates are on the rise, so is the vix, which will trigger margin calls.    If this theory is right, then we are seeing funds behind the scenes being liquidated at a rapid rate due to margin calls.  This results in them selling indiscriminately.  It doesn\u2019t matter if a company already has a super low valuation and is crushing earnings. The fund has to sell.  If you found a company with a p/e of 6 and a growth rate of 50% yoy, with massive margins and great FCF 6 months ago, it\u2019s probably got a pe of 3 or less now.  \n\nTimes like these are when investors like Klarman and Einhorn are expected to CRUSH.  \n\nTheir strategy is almost entirely based on simply buying dirt cheap companies with asymmetric opportunities.   Einhorn got fucked in the ass over the last 10 years because he also shorted companies like Tesla, Amazon, and Netflix, but 2021, 2022 and the near future could see him make up for all those losses in my opinion. \n\nMark my words, recession or no recession, Einhorn is positioned to have a very good decade moving forward.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I don\u2019t know if this is related to your thesis but the after hours action before and after ER are published has been very strange.  \n\nYesterday DIS, a blue chip super stable company had its price bouncing around AH (after being pushed down all day during market open).

I have to accept the possibility that interest rates may actually increase more than I think.  Or it could be a combination of both factors.\n\nEdit:  Just read that Bill Miller has had to sell a ton of his holdings due to margin calls.
