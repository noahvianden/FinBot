{"title": "A Retard's Guide to Market Dynamics - Why Stocks Go UP and DOWN", "selftext": "Here's a few concepts that will help you troglodytes understand the basic structure of the market & dynamics for trading based on a Calendar. (Yes, the actual calendar dates matter)\n\n# 1st Concept: The Market Consists of Active and Passive Participants\n\n**Active Participants \"APs\",** are just that, they frequently are buying and selling in an effort to outperform a benchmark or index (Buying & selling shares or options) . \n\n**Passive Participants \"PPs\"** involve less buying and selling, invest through mutual/index funds, or have an automatic schedule for purchase (i.e. 401k deposit from their paycheck) \n\nWhat does this mean? It means that **APs actually control the price**. That's why option driven equity flows are so important. APs are able to use leverage via purchasing an option contract to force option dealers to hedge via purchasing or short-selling shares of the underlying asset. (Long call - dealer buys shares. Long put - dealer short sells shares) These options have a larger effect on the underlying asset's price movement than buying shares with the same positional dollar amount. Please see this graphic below for an easy understanding.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/08jgmvnptf191.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cd07f17baf9b4f6918e8f74c32c04e199738fe4\n\nTo understand what happens each week, you have to know where we are on the Option Expiration Calendar. On the 3rd Friday of every month, participants (bulls & bears) fight each other, **ultimately choosing the direction of the market until next month's Option Expiration Day \"OPEX\".** \n\nYou'll notice most option dates have Friday expirations between Monthly OPEX's, but most participants ultimately choose those 3rd Fridays for liquidity/volume reasons. This means that the delta-gamma hedges from option dealers are likely to \"hold\" that direction into Monthly OPEX.  Here's an example using TSLA's historic run-up in Nov-2020 to January 2021. \n\nSee this open interest \"OI\" TSLA Calls (graph below)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1achiea8qf191.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1682ee582470656a3f203ae46879483323b62d2\n\nAs you can see on 11/20 and 12/18, the OI of call options are far GREATER than other Friday expirations. On 11/20, into close the market sold off as those 11/20 \"hedges\" on call options for the bullish month of October 16th to November 20th sold off their hedges from calls purchased by APs. On this point, I don't want you to assume that this will always happen every Monthly OPEX, because there are always participants purchasing and/or selling throughout the trading session. \n\nIt's fair to assume that when options flow points heavily to the upside that this will occur - especially if the move \"squeezes\" during the week of OPEX because of the skew towards short-dated options. On the following Monday (day after OPEX), November 23, 2020, you can assume that this day is very important.... because it sets us on the train tracks into the next month's OPEX. We had a slight gap up, some volatility intra-day and a ramp into end of day. Tuesday ended green and we held that same level through the rest of the week. This was a good indication that we would continue higher through Nov to December's OPEX. It's never 100% safe to assume that a following Monday OPEX will choose the direction for the next month, as APs could find any reason to sell any moment. (i.e. war breaks out, jpow changes stance, stimulus deal, market runs too hot \\[blow-off top\\], etc.)  Coordinated selling can always drop the price, and price moving down can cause option dealers to sell hedges. \n\nIt can work both ways; as we're seeing now in the current market (put gamma causing market makers to \"short\" shares into the following opex; depressing prices). Once those puts expire, shorted shares are bought back and we \"bounce\" typically near OPEX (quad-witching week more reliable).\n\n# 2nd Concept: VIX Term Structure\n\nAre market participants betting on volatility in the near term? VIX is comprised of Call & Put options on the S&P 500 Index. When VIX goes up, that means participants are purchasing more put options than call options. This is a basic concept, but often overlooked. You need to tie that into concept #1 above. If P/C ratio is low. That means that more calls are being purchased \"Bulls beating Bears\"; therefore, If price moves up, then option dealers are forced to buy more shares of the underlying asset, pushing price higher.\n\n# 3rd Concept: Technical Analysis\n\nYou have to understand charting basics, volume profile, and supply & demand zones. I won't get into this topic in detail since my post history covers this.\n\nYes everyone on WSB loves to shit on technicals - but the truth is anything that isn't fundamental analysis is technical analysis. Most of you guys are using TA in some form or another without even realizing it. **Effective short-term trading is done through proper risk management combined with technical analysis to identify asymmetrical trades.** Knowing about a P/E ratio will do you no good trading options weeklies.\n\nFurthermore, 99% of the people on the internet who do TA, do it completely wrong. Basically almost every single TA post on WSB is just spewing bias and nonsense. This is what gives TA such a horrible reputation around here, and why it appears to be complete bullshit. \n\nIf you want to get into real TA, don't go on YouTube or any of that bullshit - pick up a book or two. I have a few favorites, but **Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets** by John Murphy takes the cake.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n[SPY Monthly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/40azdgx6sf191.png?width=2283&format=png&auto=webp&s=afa5108019232dc64a99f34cbedcb8664d7f6561)\n\nThis is a SPY trendline from the lows of 2007 which held for a decade and heralded one of the 2018 tops, as well as the 2020 top and the election top.\n\nFurthermore, breaking it spurred a rally from 357 -> 480.\n\nOne thing to note about lines in TA - the more significant the points they connect (historically) - the more important they are. In the same vein, the longer the timeframe - the more important they are.\n\n# 4th Concept: Investor Sentiment\n\nAre AP's bullish, bearish, somewhere in the middle? \n\nGo to [https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/](https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/) and look at the fear/greed index. Sometimes outliers (extreme fear or greed) can mean we're at a local bottom or top because being \"too bullish\" can lead to profit taking (calls close/price drops) and \"too bearish\" can lead to profit taking (puts close/price bounces).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fdaleeehrf191.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=05b1d3f38342814abb152e84faf8c5b09aaa43b2\n\n# 5th Concept: The Changing Dynamics of Who Are the Active Participants\n\nThe growing number of active participants in the stock market is changing how it functions. Investors are using options trading more than ever before. The sheer volume is staggering. Mostly attributable to the ease of access to trading on apps like Robinhood & WeBull, etc. This is why Option Driven Equity Flow discussed in 1st Concept is so important. They are moving price more than ever.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/13rxfuwmrf191.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec3eda8a5fd2978081312c4bf70270c353300e01\n\n*Follow the money & check the calendar!*", "id": "ux00np", "created_utc": 1653423568.0, "score": 62, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 39, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|54|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|587|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ux00np)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ux00np)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.010984847322106361}, {"body": "im confused\n\n\n\nis this for retards or by retards or both", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "How should I know?

A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking Satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains.

I get it's a joke, but people take it as an actual, educational joke like it's a man yelling at the sea, and that's just wrong. Furthermore, these things have an actual impact on discussions about conservation efforts---If every time Koalas get brought up, someone posts this copypasta, that means it's seriously shaping public opinion about the animal and their supposed lack of importance.\n\n> Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives.\n\nNon-ecologists always talk this way, and the problem is you\u2019re looking at this backwards.\n\nAn entire continent is covered with Eucalyptus trees. They suck the moisture out of the entire surrounding area and use allelopathy to ensure that most of what\u2019s beneath them is just bare red dust. No animal is making use of them\u2014\u2014they have virtually no herbivore predator. A niche is empty. Then inevitably, natural selection fills that niche by creating an animal which *can* eat Eucalyptus leaves. Of course, it takes great sacrifice for it to be able to do so\u2014\u2014it certainly can\u2019t expend much energy on costly things. Isn\u2019t it a good thing that a niche is being filled?\n\n\n> Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death\n\nThis applies to all herbivores, because the wild is not a grocery store\u2014where meat is just sitting next to celery.\n\nHerbivores gradually wear their teeth down\u2014carnivores fracture their teeth, and break their bones in attempting to take down prey. \n\n> They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal\n\nIt's pretty typical of herbivores, and is higher than many, many species. According to Ashwell (2008), their encephalisation quotient is 0.5288 +/- 0.051. Higher than comparable marsupials like the wombat (~0.52), some possums (~0.468), cuscus (~0.462) and even some wallabies are <0.5. According to wiki, rabbits are also around 0.4, and they're placental mammals.\n\n> additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons.\n\nAgain, this is not unique to koalas. Brain folds (gyri) are not present in rodents, which we consider to be incredibly intelligent for their size.\n\n> If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food.\n\nIf you present a human with a random piece of meat, they will not recognise it as food (hopefully). Fresh leaves might be important for koala digestion, especially since their gut flora is clearly important for the digestion of Eucalyptus. It might make sense not to screw with that gut flora by eating decaying leaves.\n\n\n> Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.\n\nThat's an extremely weird reason to dislike an animal. But whilst we're talking about their digestion, let's discuss their poop. It's delightful. It smells like a Eucalyptus drop!\n\n> Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).\n\nMarsupial milk is incredibly complex and much more interesting than any placentals. This is because they raise their offspring essentially from an embryo, and the milk needs to adapt to the changing needs of a growing fetus. And yeah, of course the yield is low; at one point they are feeding an animal that is half a gram!\n\nWhen the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system.\n\nHumans probably do this, we just likely do it during childbirth. You know how women often shit during contractions? There is evidence to suggest that this innoculates a baby with her gut flora. A child born via cesarian has significantly different gut flora for the first six months of life than a child born vaginally.\n\n> Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher.\n\nChlamydia was introduced to their populations by humans. We introduced a novel disease that they have very little immunity to, and is a major contributor to their possible extinction. Do you hate Native Americans because they were killed by smallpox and influenza?\n\n> This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree,\n\nAlmost every animal does this.\n\n> which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet. I fucking hate them.\n\nErrmmm.. They have protection against falling from a tree, which they spend 99% of their life in? Yeah...

{"title": "A Retard's Guide to Market Dynamics - Why Stocks Go UP and DOWN", "selftext": "Here's a few concepts that will help you troglodytes understand the basic structure of the market & dynamics for trading based on a Calendar. (Yes, the actual calendar dates matter)\n\n# 1st Concept: The Market Consists of Active and Passive Participants\n\n**Active Participants \"APs\",** are just that, they frequently are buying and selling in an effort to outperform a benchmark or index (Buying & selling shares or options) . \n\n**Passive Participants \"PPs\"** involve less buying and selling, invest through mutual/index funds, or have an automatic schedule for purchase (i.e. 401k deposit from their paycheck) \n\nWhat does this mean? It means that **APs actually control the price**. That's why option driven equity flows are so important. APs are able to use leverage via purchasing an option contract to force option dealers to hedge via purchasing or short-selling shares of the underlying asset. (Long call - dealer buys shares. Long put - dealer short sells shares) These options have a larger effect on the underlying asset's price movement than buying shares with the same positional dollar amount. Please see this graphic below for an easy understanding.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/08jgmvnptf191.png?width=647&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cd07f17baf9b4f6918e8f74c32c04e199738fe4\n\nTo understand what happens each week, you have to know where we are on the Option Expiration Calendar. On the 3rd Friday of every month, participants (bulls & bears) fight each other, **ultimately choosing the direction of the market until next month's Option Expiration Day \"OPEX\".** \n\nYou'll notice most option dates have Friday expirations between Monthly OPEX's, but most participants ultimately choose those 3rd Fridays for liquidity/volume reasons. This means that the delta-gamma hedges from option dealers are likely to \"hold\" that direction into Monthly OPEX.  Here's an example using TSLA's historic run-up in Nov-2020 to January 2021. \n\nSee this open interest \"OI\" TSLA Calls (graph below)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1achiea8qf191.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=d1682ee582470656a3f203ae46879483323b62d2\n\nAs you can see on 11/20 and 12/18, the OI of call options are far GREATER than other Friday expirations. On 11/20, into close the market sold off as those 11/20 \"hedges\" on call options for the bullish month of October 16th to November 20th sold off their hedges from calls purchased by APs. On this point, I don't want you to assume that this will always happen every Monthly OPEX, because there are always participants purchasing and/or selling throughout the trading session. \n\nIt's fair to assume that when options flow points heavily to the upside that this will occur - especially if the move \"squeezes\" during the week of OPEX because of the skew towards short-dated options. On the following Monday (day after OPEX), November 23, 2020, you can assume that this day is very important.... because it sets us on the train tracks into the next month's OPEX. We had a slight gap up, some volatility intra-day and a ramp into end of day. Tuesday ended green and we held that same level through the rest of the week. This was a good indication that we would continue higher through Nov to December's OPEX. It's never 100% safe to assume that a following Monday OPEX will choose the direction for the next month, as APs could find any reason to sell any moment. (i.e. war breaks out, jpow changes stance, stimulus deal, market runs too hot \\[blow-off top\\], etc.)  Coordinated selling can always drop the price, and price moving down can cause option dealers to sell hedges. \n\nIt can work both ways; as we're seeing now in the current market (put gamma causing market makers to \"short\" shares into the following opex; depressing prices). Once those puts expire, shorted shares are bought back and we \"bounce\" typically near OPEX (quad-witching week more reliable).\n\n# 2nd Concept: VIX Term Structure\n\nAre market participants betting on volatility in the near term? VIX is comprised of Call & Put options on the S&P 500 Index. When VIX goes up, that means participants are purchasing more put options than call options. This is a basic concept, but often overlooked. You need to tie that into concept #1 above. If P/C ratio is low. That means that more calls are being purchased \"Bulls beating Bears\"; therefore, If price moves up, then option dealers are forced to buy more shares of the underlying asset, pushing price higher.\n\n# 3rd Concept: Technical Analysis\n\nYou have to understand charting basics, volume profile, and supply & demand zones. I won't get into this topic in detail since my post history covers this.\n\nYes everyone on WSB loves to shit on technicals - but the truth is anything that isn't fundamental analysis is technical analysis. Most of you guys are using TA in some form or another without even realizing it. **Effective short-term trading is done through proper risk management combined with technical analysis to identify asymmetrical trades.** Knowing about a P/E ratio will do you no good trading options weeklies.\n\nFurthermore, 99% of the people on the internet who do TA, do it completely wrong. Basically almost every single TA post on WSB is just spewing bias and nonsense. This is what gives TA such a horrible reputation around here, and why it appears to be complete bullshit. \n\nIf you want to get into real TA, don't go on YouTube or any of that bullshit - pick up a book or two. I have a few favorites, but **Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets** by John Murphy takes the cake.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n[SPY Monthly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/40azdgx6sf191.png?width=2283&format=png&auto=webp&s=afa5108019232dc64a99f34cbedcb8664d7f6561)\n\nThis is a SPY trendline from the lows of 2007 which held for a decade and heralded one of the 2018 tops, as well as the 2020 top and the election top.\n\nFurthermore, breaking it spurred a rally from 357 -> 480.\n\nOne thing to note about lines in TA - the more significant the points they connect (historically) - the more important they are. In the same vein, the longer the timeframe - the more important they are.\n\n# 4th Concept: Investor Sentiment\n\nAre AP's bullish, bearish, somewhere in the middle? \n\nGo to [https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/](https://money.cnn.com/data/fear-and-greed/) and look at the fear/greed index. Sometimes outliers (extreme fear or greed) can mean we're at a local bottom or top because being \"too bullish\" can lead to profit taking (calls close/price drops) and \"too bearish\" can lead to profit taking (puts close/price bounces).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fdaleeehrf191.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=05b1d3f38342814abb152e84faf8c5b09aaa43b2\n\n# 5th Concept: The Changing Dynamics of Who Are the Active Participants\n\nThe growing number of active participants in the stock market is changing how it functions. Investors are using options trading more than ever before. The sheer volume is staggering. Mostly attributable to the ease of access to trading on apps like Robinhood & WeBull, etc. This is why Option Driven Equity Flow discussed in 1st Concept is so important. They are moving price more than ever.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/13rxfuwmrf191.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec3eda8a5fd2978081312c4bf70270c353300e01\n\n*Follow the money & check the calendar!*", "id": "ux00np", "created_utc": 1653423568.0, "score": 62, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 39, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|54|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|587|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ux00np)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ux00np)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.010984847322106361}, {"body": "im confused\n\n\n\nis this for retards or by retards or both", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "How should I know?

A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally scream like fucking Satan. Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal. Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths, others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death, because they're fucking terrible animals. Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here). When the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains. This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed helmet.

Furthermore, these things have an actual impact on discussions about conservation efforts---If every time Koalas get brought up, someone posts this copypasta, that means it's seriously shaping public opinion about the animal and their supposed lack of importance.\n\n> Speaking of stupidity and food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking lives.\n\nNon-ecologists always talk this way, and the problem is you\u2019re looking at this backwards.\n\nAn entire continent is covered with Eucalyptus trees. They suck the moisture out of the entire surrounding area and use allelopathy to ensure that most of what\u2019s beneath them is just bare red dust. No animal is making use of them\u2014\u2014they have virtually no herbivore predator. A niche is empty. Then inevitably, natural selection fills that niche by creating an animal which *can* eat Eucalyptus leaves. Of course, it takes great sacrifice for it to be able to do so\u2014\u2014it certainly can\u2019t expend much energy on costly things. Isn\u2019t it a good thing that a niche is being filled?\n\n\n> Koalas are no exception, when their teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to death\n\nThis applies to all herbivores, because the wild is not a grocery store\u2014where meat is just sitting next to celery.\n\nHerbivores gradually wear their teeth down\u2014carnivores fracture their teeth, and break their bones in attempting to take down prey. \n\n> They have one of the smallest brain to body ratios of any mammal\n\nIt's pretty typical of herbivores, and is higher than many, many species. According to Ashwell (2008), their encephalisation quotient is 0.5288 +/- 0.051. Higher than comparable marsupials like the wombat (~0.52), some possums (~0.468), cuscus (~0.462) and even some wallabies are <0.5. According to wiki, rabbits are also around 0.4, and they're placental mammals.\n\n> additionally - their brains are smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons.\n\nAgain, this is not unique to koalas. Brain folds (gyri) are not present in rodents, which we consider to be incredibly intelligent for their size.\n\n> If you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat surface, the koala will not recognise it as food.\n\nIf you present a human with a random piece of meat, they will not recognise it as food (hopefully). Fresh leaves might be important for koala digestion, especially since their gut flora is clearly important for the digestion of Eucalyptus. It might make sense not to screw with that gut flora by eating decaying leaves.\n\n\n> Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.\n\nThat's an extremely weird reason to dislike an animal. But whilst we're talking about their digestion, let's discuss their poop. It's delightful. It smells like a Eucalyptus drop!\n\n> Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk (admittedly, one of the lowest milk yields to body ratio... There's a trend here).\n\nMarsupial milk is incredibly complex and much more interesting than any placentals. This is because they raise their offspring essentially from an embryo, and the milk needs to adapt to the changing needs of a growing fetus. And yeah, of course the yield is low; at one point they are feeding an animal that is half a gram!\n\nWhen the young joey needs to transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus (a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't want to be eaten), it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea (actually fecal pap, slightly less digested), which he then proceeds to slurp on. This partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start developing his digestive system.\n\nHumans probably do this, we just likely do it during childbirth. You know how women often shit during contractions? There is evidence to suggest that this innoculates a baby with her gut flora. A child born via cesarian has significantly different gut flora for the first six months of life than a child born vaginally.\n\n> Of course, he may not even have needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from incontinence. Why? Because koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is 80% or higher.\n\nChlamydia was introduced to their populations by humans. We introduced a novel disease that they have very little immunity to, and is a major contributor to their possible extinction. Do you hate Native Americans because they were killed by smallpox and influenza?\n\n> This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she is ovulating.
