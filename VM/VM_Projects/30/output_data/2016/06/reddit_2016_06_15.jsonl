{"title": "War is coming. How do we profit?", "selftext": "I've been trying to learn more, about the history, and possible consequences of this bonds market going to all time lows and negative. My latest tin-foil-hat theory is that WWIII is coming. Look at the [chart](http://i.imgur.com/4zjtLrm.png), you'll see the US has been here before, but it happened a few years before WWII... of course the reasons for WWII don't really correlate to the markets, or do they? According to history, what exactly was Hitler's End Game?\n\n>Hitler's strategy involved occupying Russia's fertile, food-growing land and using it to feed Germans while 'unnutze Esser' -- 'useless mouths', eg Slavs, Jews, socialists/leftists, the disabled, and Central Asians -- starved to death. This was called the Hunger Plan (der Hungerplan) and he expected it to kill approx 25-30 million people, pushing Russia into submission. Germany would claim much of the USSR's land as lebensraum ('living space') and use it to feed their army; Germany wasn't up to fully satisfying its food needs without imports.\n\nSo, after this continues and we reenter recession, just like the[ 1937 continued 'depression'](http://i.imgur.com/vpeiDFj.png), similar radical reshaping of political views will occur, followed by increased currency and economic wars, eventually ending in WWIII.\n\n#####None of this matters to me, I'm fucking deaf and can't be drafted.
