Wall Street thinks the Internet is a medium like print or TV, but it isn't.  This is why local news, TV news, newspapers, etc persistently fail at the Internet.  You can't convince them that there are bad users, because their 100 year old business model is based on circulation and/or ratings.

If they are not eliminated your internet presence is doomed to failure and when it fails it stays that way, there is no recovering good users once they leave.  Facebook avoids this pitfall by constantly censoring with changes to their news feed algos and not telling people how or why they're doing so.\n\nIt's also a constant balancing act to push ads while not pushing ads.  It's no big secret why we don't see video ads despite the constantly dangling carrot, that carrot is just to appease Wall Street plebs.
