That you want to limit your downside risk.

Not a bad outcome, given you're buying freaking Apple after all.\n\n* If Apple trades above $97.50 and drifts higher the rest of the year, you're going to catch that upside and still participate via the calls.\n\n* If Apple trades sideways and stays in that $85 - $97 range, you can pick your spot to re-buy and effectively miss nothing (except maybe some dividend)\n\nObviously you have the dead zone between October and January, where you'll have to either roll your calls, or close out your puts.

Limit orders guarantee price but not execution. \n\nLike I said above there is software that can offer more functionality than Robinhood in terms of stop losses and different order types but it is not free. You get what you pay for. In this case you get basic functionality but the tradeoff is that sometimes you might get F'd on an order during times of high volatility.
