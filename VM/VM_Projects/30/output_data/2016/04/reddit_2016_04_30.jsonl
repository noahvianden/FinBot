Is apple a lost cause at this point with lack of innovations or is a good long term (5-10 years) investment?", "id": "4h5dhi", "created_utc": 1462037910.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "I'm not sure the selling is done, but if you are going for a long-term investment, AAPL is a very safe bet. However, your timeline is way off for a tech company. You should consider a much shorter timeline as being \"long-term.\" Things can change a lot in 2-3 years regarding tech/trends. \n\nThere is no lack of innovation at Apple. This is something casuals love to pass off as insight. Apple has never been a do-it-first company. They have almost always been a do-it-better-at-the-right-time company. \n\nPeople keep citing VR as something that will kill the iphone, but they apparently don't remember the 3D Android sets (e.g. HTC EVO 3D) that came out that were supposed to do the same (around the iphone 4 timeline, where AAPL experienced some of its best growth). VR tech in your phone is going to end up like the 3D tech in your television (at least for the short term). You are going to use it once to play with/show off, and never use it again. \n\nIf you don't believe Apple is \"innovating\" (in the sense that they are working on cutting edge tech) you should look at this chart:\n\nhttp://www.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Apple-Car.jpg\n\nIf you saw behind-the-scenes how many resources they have compared to HTC, Samsung, etc. (which is all a fragmented system), you would understand why they are in the best position to bring something game-changing to the phone experience. \n\nOne of Apple's most underrated technologies released recently is TouchID. While an acquisition like most tech, Apple has incorporated it into the phone to completely change one of the most basic and often-used features of a phone (unlocking it). No one cares because it isn't flashy. My Android Galaxy Nexus had face-recognition unlock, which most would argue is much cooler and more \"sophisticated\" tech. But which of the two works better and is more pragmatic for everyday use? TouchID by a long-shot. Not only that, but it is integrated into most of my apps now that require a password, and has just made one tedious task that much easier. I used to hate signing into my bank apps/websites to pay bills or check things, but TouchID has made it so easy that I do it much more frequently.\n\nThat Nexus has NFC tech and Google Wallet as well. Cutting edge stuff. Too bad no one used it, and it was a really poor user experience. I used it maybe once because there was a promotional code for free money, but never again. Apple Pay on the other hand? I use it every time I go to Rubios and Trader Joes. It's saved me a few times where I left that card at home, and needed it for a refund at Nike and Foot Locker. If everyone took it, I would use it everywhere I go. \n\nApple was not first on either of these technologies. Arguably, Android was first with Wallet. But who is really playing catch-up? IMO, it's Android. They abandoned Wallet, and only tried Android Pay after seeing Apple's success with Apple Pay. They also incorporated their own (shittier) fingerprint scanner into their phones, but lack the speed, accuracy, and integration of Apple's TouchID version. Not to mention how they are blatantly copying the aesthetic design of iphones. \n\nApple integrates tech to perfect a user experience. It doesn't integrate the latest cutting edge stuff just because it can (and believe me, it can if it wanted to). Mail, Music, Messaging/Facetime (a private free MMS/videochat network with any iphone user), vertical integration with your tablet and laptop (handoff), etc. \n\nAndroid makers have ONE major advantage: and that is pricing, especially in emerging markets like India and China. There is almost nothing Apple can do to cut into this segment since they are a margin machine in the high-end space. There will always be a new low-cost Android maker coming about. It used to be Samsung, and is now Xiaomi/Huawei (who are already climbing into the high-end space).

Corporate phones, corporate machines, etc. Even in 2012 Blackberry was still a dominant (maybe the largest) force in the corporate world. Today: all those large corporations and firms are moving to the iphone. Even look where you would never think to look: in the past, every cash register at a restaurant/gas station was IBM. Now, with more and more small businesses, you see people using Square on ipads. \n\nTake a look in a classroom ~2005, and you still had mostly (90%+) PCs. Now: 90%+ Apple laptops. \n\nA huge reason why Apple struggled so much in the 90s is that they were not compatible with anything. All the software was being developed for PCs. Guess who has the advantage in development these days? \n\nPeople are acting like Apple lost money this quarter, but that couldn't be further from the truth. They just did not grow this quarter (during an S-model cycle), and who could blame them? After 13 years of growth, billions in revenue, and dominating the premium market...It has to end somewhere. There are only so many users to capture. If Apple got 100% of the potential users out there, and got them to upgrade yearly, they would still stop growing after getting that final user. \n\nThe problem is click-bait headlines citing \"Revenue Decline\" without specifying y/o/y, or even if they did, casual readers wouldn't even know. Even sophisticated readers browsing the headlines and not reading more might just take it as if Apple lost money. Nothing could be further from the truth. \n\nOne thing I really can't stand about investing is that it is built on a faulty paradigm of growth. Everything is about growth. You could have no business model at all, but as long as you are growing, you are being valued highly (ah, the Silicon Valley VC model of giving away free things to drive growth numbers). \n\n\n\n\n", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I'm finna get some bananas instead.", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05962627753615379}], "tickers": ["ibm", "aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I have a nexus 5x, and the fingerprint scanner works perfectly.
