If you bought the shares for a short to medium term gain you have to wait until the price drops then buy or there is some change in circumstances or you know some thing that everyone else does not - this is very unlikely. If you are unwise enough to buy when there is low demand for the shares then you should expect if the market outlook is seen as bad - a bear market - that the price will drop. Then as the price drops more will sell and the price will drop further. You should have been very unhappy if you bought at $250 when it went below $225 as you had already lost alot of value. As the price went further down you would get to the stage of not considering selling at any cost. You are underwater and if Tesla failed or suffered a bad set back you could loose a chunk of money or have the money tied up for years. IMHO it is better to take a small loss and make it up with another well thoughout, well timed investment than to stubbornly sit on shares through thick or thin.
