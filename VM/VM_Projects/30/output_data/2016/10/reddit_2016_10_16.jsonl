Low interest rates makes lending cheap, it makes it easy to borrow and when people have easy access to borrowed cash, they can take on debt to purchase assets which in turn inflate the assets price.\n\nThis can only be sustained so long as A. Interest rates stay low or keep going lower, B. Real income rises or C. Supply is kept below demand. \n\nThus far, we know A isn't going to happen according to the fed, so all that's left is for real income to rise, if it does then great, housing prices will continue to appreciate as people can still afford to buy homes, if not then there will be a correction as potential buyers are pushed out of the market. \n\nC, is kind of happening in some places, with local governments restricting new home constructions and buildings in major cities which in turn drives up prices which makes more people rent which also drives up rental prices...
