They are playing the long game here. \n\nIt all started with Mantle and giving the software developers control of the metal. AMD is currently the ONLY supplier of CPUs and GPUs for all the major consoles. The developers are becoming really good at programming and using AMD hardware. Because most of the money is in console gaming, AMD GPUs are programmed for first and programs are optimized for AMD.\n\nNow...\n\nNvidia's chips are getting really large in physical size. This drives the costs of Nvidia's cards up. There is no way around it. Chips get bigger every generation and costs go up or profits go down.\n\nAMD has plans to put multiple small GPU chips on one card and run them like a Crossfire setup. Because the GPUs are all on one board they will be easy to control unlike Crossfire where cards are in different slots. If they put 4 GPUs on one card, the card will each render a frame in succession so the GPU will be rendering 4 frames or more at once. (Rumor has it that they may put as many as 8 GPUs on one card.)\n\nThis won't happen until next year after Zen comes out. Rumor has it that Zen will not have on board graphics. (They will keep their \"A\" series CPUs with on board graphics for people that don't need fast graphics.) This will allow AMD to offer gaming CPUs that have 6, 8 or 10 cores because they will have more room on the chip.\n\nSo end result 2 years from now, an awesome gaming computer will have a Zen CPU with 8 cores driving an AMD video card that has 4 GPUs on board.\n\nThe gaming software developers are currently maximizing the consoles using all the AMD CPU cores and the new consoles will have multiple GPUs on board for really good VR. At that point it will be all over for Intel and Nvidia selling into the consumer market.\n\n(Anybody remember Intel cutting their CPU workforce by 12,000 people recently so they can concentrate on  B2B sales?)\n\n(Why do you think Nvidia is trying to get out of the GPU business by starting to sell vision equipment for cars?
