{"title": "NVIDIA: How to miss a boat", "selftext": "#Name: Nvidia\n\n#Ticker: $NVDA\n\n#^^Accurate ^^as ^^of ^^May ^^26th, ^^2016\n\n-----------------------\n\n#DCF:\n\n#RESULTS--->http://imgur.com/a/GpdhJ<--- (Zoom in)\n\n**Cliff's Note: $50 Target, at 45.72 at the moment giving around 10% upside**\n\n######DATA:https://www.dropbox.com/s/6e90885minapxam/NVDA%20DATA.xlsx?dl=0\n\n\n\n-------------------------\n###Background\nHeadquartered in **Santa Clara California** and employing **9100** **employees** worldwide Nvidia designs graphics processing units (GPUs) for the gaming market, as well as system on a chip units for the automotive market. Primary GPU product line:\"GeForce\", is in direct competition with AMD's \"Radeon\" .\n\n**Focus on: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Centers and Auto.**\n\n\nIn addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers  efficiently run high-performance applications. Deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. More recently, Nvidia has moved out of the mobile computing market, where it produced Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets, as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. \n\n**In addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel and Qualcomm.**\n\n--------------\n\n#$NVDA REPORT\n\n###Capitalization\n\n*Sector | Industry*: **Tech  | Semiconductors**\n\n*Price as of Post* |  *YTD%*: **$45.70** | **43.43 %**\n\n*Market Cap*:  **23.67B** : *Large Cap*\n\n###Revenue, Profits, Margins (FY11 - FY16)\nRevenue Trend: 3.54B --> 5.01B = **+41.5%**\n\nEarnings: 343M --> 780M = **+127%**\n\nNet Margin: 10% --> 15% = **+50%**\n\nGross Margin: 44% --> 56% = **+27%**\n\nRevenue continues to grow, with earnings growth outpacing revenue growth showing good cost cutting and efficiency within, however OpProfit margin <25% so still room for improvement in this regard, dominance over comp AMD in the GPU market with customers highly choosing NVDA over AMD so solid source of cash flows that will continue for foreseeable future, in addition to branching out to automotive tech and research based processors as well as a good foot in the VR door. NVDA will continue to increase its revenue in the near-mid future. \n\n###Comps\n\nUp against AMD in the GPU market, have dominantly stolen market share from AMD and continues to take customers from the struggling company, **has gone from 62% share to 82%** in the GPU market since 2011, ADM on brink of collapse/bought out so in the core GPU market NVDA is very strong. $INTC and $QCOM are other comps but the other 2 don't really go head to head with NVDA has they focus on the CPU market vs NVDA's GPU base. **TLDR: RIP AMD**\n\n###Multiples\n* **P/E**: **41.83** *pretty high* *note: that '17-'18 ests come in around 30, '16 was a really good year for NVDA* : **INTC and QCOM both have P/E of 12-14 then of course AMD has -6**. Could be a good sign that investors expecting more growth in the company but could also mean company overpriced *(as we will see later this is **by my math* false)*. Could also be sign that INTC and QCOM underpriced, etc\n\n* **P/B: 5.57:  INTC's = 2.42 QCOM=2.77** AMD = N/A ::SSDD as above\n\n* **Entreprise Multiple: (EV/EBITDA) : 17.15**|| INTC: 6.88 , QCOM: 9.40 |||||So again NVDA leads the way and SSDD reasons as above, no one knows for sure (welcome to finance)||||| For valuation purposes EV/EBITDA range of 13-15x used has older companies begin to get lower EM's has keeping constant EM's become unsustainable.\n\n###Management and Ownership\n\n* 5% Insider\n* 88% Institutional\n* 7% us individuals\n\n**CEO, President and Co-Founder ^(^^what ^^a ^^big ^^boi) : Jen-Hsun Huang** : founded NVDA in 1993, holds 7300 patent assets fundamental to modern computing, invented the GPU in 1999. Been with the company his whole life obviously and knows what the fuck he's doing clearly even if he has no experience elsewhere (other BOD hacks can cover this) Holds multiple awards regarding innovation, yadda yadda, guy has led this company to success so I see no wrong here and no negative\n\n **Co-founder: Chris A. Malachowsky**: 30 years industry EXP, key figure in the path the company goes down, has led numerous departments throughout his time with Nvidia like stated above Malachowsky has exp at HP (rip Fiorina) and Sun Microsystems so he has that outside edge that the CEO doesn't. Also won some Emmy in 2009??? So good for him I guess\n\n\n**VP and CFO: Colette Kress** : Joined in 2013 after 25 years of xp at other tech companies (mirin). Including CFO at Cisco and CFO of MSFTs \"Server and Tools\" divison. Prior to that was at TI in a variety of roles. This girl knows what's up (couldve went somewhere else for her MBA but whatcha gonna do now)\n\n3 other BOD members but they all hold similar xp and shit\n\n###10K Notes\n\nNVDA 2016-10K Notes\n\n* GeForce = #1 PC gaming platform: 2.8B +37% 77M users\n\n* Quadro = #1 design platform 78% mrkt share\n\n* DRIVE PX: self driving platform (70 corps using NVDAs tech)\n\n* ITC ruled in fav of Samsung regarding patent suit\n\n* Exited mobile market\n\n*  Stopped building modems\n\n* VR gonna fuck your shit up fams\n\n###Stock History (here's where we start to go south...)\n\n*No preferred shares*\n\nStock chilling at 45.75 when I began writing this 45.8 right now. As we have all seen it has completely dominated this year and as we will see later is basically at the margin of error for fair value right now. This thing was a steal a few months ago but right now you have no guarantee of gains, this will be a buy the dip kind of stock.\n\n\n###Expectations\n\nThe high analyst estimate is $50 (they have 1 year timeframes), I'm getting $51 with a very conservative estimates for intrinsic value based on current figures. You can still squeeze out 5-10% perhaps on this stock but is by now means a YOLO, unless you want to delve into some <monthly all or nothing 50C play. Average estimate is where the stock is right now. \n\n###Risks\n\nAMD makes a miraculous comeback (as if)\n\nThe more serious one is that VR doesn't do as well as people are thinking. Even with my conservative figures VR has to at least do \"ok\" for NVDA to grow at all. VR could make or break a play on NVDA, outlook looks good but this could become the next fad for all we know. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nNVDA is a buy/hold, not a sell by no means, but also not a strong buy, as I will present in my figures below it has 5-15% upside to it with 15% being really optimistic.\n\nThe company is strong and doing well, so go ahead and allocate 2%  (or 200% because what's the point to life without margin) of your portfolio towards NVDA, I myself am picking up at a Jan17 ATM call spread on the stock.\n\n##Wait for a dip to buy in because it's not going much higher if at all \n\nHope you guys enjoyed, week got busy af and I counted my chickens before they hatched so this was the most thorough one I got around to doing but will make my way through the list as I can.\n\n\n\n\n\n----------------\n\n#TLDR:\n\n##http://imgur.com/a/GpdhJ\n\n##+\n\n## Wait for a dip to buy in because it's not going much higher if at all \n\n-----------------\n\n#I am not a licsensed financial representative; nothing written above constitutes as financial advice", "id": "4l7123", "created_utc": 1464290845.0, "score": 73, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "Did you create this spreadsheet (in the imgur)?

Primary GPU product line:\"GeForce\", is in direct competition with AMD's \"Radeon\" .\n\n**Focus on: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Centers and Auto.**\n\n\nIn addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides parallel processing capabilities to researchers  efficiently run high-performance applications. Deployed in supercomputing sites around the world. More recently, Nvidia has moved out of the mobile computing market, where it produced Tegra mobile processors for smartphones and tablets, as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. \n\n**In addition to AMD, its competitors include Intel and Qualcomm.**\n\n--------------\n\n#$NVDA REPORT\n\n###Capitalization\n\n*Sector | Industry*: **Tech  | Semiconductors**\n\n*Price as of Post* |  *YTD%*: **$45.70** | **43.43 %**\n\n*Market Cap*:  **23.67B** : *Large Cap*\n\n###Revenue, Profits, Margins (FY11 - FY16)\nRevenue Trend: 3.54B --> 5.01B = **+41.5%**\n\nEarnings: 343M --> 780M = **+127%**\n\nNet Margin: 10% --> 15% = **+50%**\n\nGross Margin: 44% --> 56% = **+27%**\n\nRevenue continues to grow, with earnings growth outpacing revenue growth showing good cost cutting and efficiency within, however OpProfit margin <25% so still room for improvement in this regard, dominance over comp AMD in the GPU market with customers highly choosing NVDA over AMD so solid source of cash flows that will continue for foreseeable future, in addition to branching out to automotive tech and research based processors as well as a good foot in the VR door. NVDA will continue to increase its revenue in the near-mid future. \n\n###Comps\n\nUp against AMD in the GPU market, have dominantly stolen market share from AMD and continues to take customers from the struggling company, **has gone from 62% share to 82%** in the GPU market since 2011, ADM on brink of collapse/bought out so in the core GPU market NVDA is very strong. $INTC and $QCOM are other comps but the other 2 don't really go head to head with NVDA has they focus on the CPU market vs NVDA's GPU base. **TLDR: RIP AMD**\n\n###Multiples\n* **P/E**: **41.83** *pretty high* *note: that '17-'18 ests come in around 30, '16 was a really good year for NVDA* : **INTC and QCOM both have P/E of 12-14 then of course AMD has -6**. Could be a good sign that investors expecting more growth in the company but could also mean company overpriced *(as we will see later this is **by my math* false)*. Could also be sign that INTC and QCOM underpriced, etc\n\n* **P/B: 5.57:  INTC's = 2.42 QCOM=2.77** AMD = N/A ::SSDD as above\n\n* **Entreprise Multiple: (EV/EBITDA) : 17.15**|| INTC: 6.88 , QCOM: 9.40 |||||So again NVDA leads the way and SSDD reasons as above, no one knows for sure (welcome to finance)||||| For valuation purposes EV/EBITDA range of 13-15x used has older companies begin to get lower EM's has keeping constant EM's become unsustainable.\n\n###Management and Ownership\n\n* 5% Insider\n* 88% Institutional\n* 7% us individuals\n\n**CEO, President and Co-Founder ^(^^what ^^a ^^big ^^boi) : Jen-Hsun Huang** : founded NVDA in 1993, holds 7300 patent assets fundamental to modern computing, invented the GPU in 1999. Been with the company his whole life obviously and knows what the fuck he's doing clearly even if he has no experience elsewhere (other BOD hacks can cover this) Holds multiple awards regarding innovation, yadda yadda, guy has led this company to success so I see no wrong here and no negative\n\n **Co-founder: Chris A. Malachowsky**: 30 years industry EXP, key figure in the path the company goes down, has led numerous departments throughout his time with Nvidia like stated above Malachowsky has exp at HP (rip Fiorina) and Sun Microsystems so he has that outside edge that the CEO doesn't. Also won some Emmy in 2009??? So good for him I guess\n\n\n**VP and CFO: Colette Kress** : Joined in 2013 after 25 years of xp at other tech companies (mirin). Including CFO at Cisco and CFO of MSFTs \"Server and Tools\" divison. Prior to that was at TI in a variety of roles. This girl knows what's up (couldve went somewhere else for her MBA but whatcha gonna do now)\n\n3 other BOD members but they all hold similar xp and shit\n\n###10K Notes\n\nNVDA 2016-10K Notes\n\n* GeForce = #1 PC gaming platform: 2.8B +37% 77M users\n\n* Quadro = #1 design platform 78% mrkt share\n\n* DRIVE PX: self driving platform (70 corps using NVDAs tech)\n\n* ITC ruled in fav of Samsung regarding patent suit\n\n* Exited mobile market\n\n*  Stopped building modems\n\n* VR gonna fuck your shit up fams\n\n###Stock History (here's where we start to go south...)\n\n*No preferred shares*\n\nStock chilling at 45.75 when I began writing this 45.8 right now. As we have all seen it has completely dominated this year and as we will see later is basically at the margin of error for fair value right now. This thing was a steal a few months ago but right now you have no guarantee of gains, this will be a buy the dip kind of stock.\n\n\n###Expectations\n\nThe high analyst estimate is $50 (they have 1 year timeframes), I'm getting $51 with a very conservative estimates for intrinsic value based on current figures. You can still squeeze out 5-10% perhaps on this stock but is by now means a YOLO, unless you want to delve into some <monthly all or nothing 50C play. Average estimate is where the stock is right now. \n\n###Risks\n\nAMD makes a miraculous comeback (as if)\n\nThe more serious one is that VR doesn't do as well as people are thinking. Even with my conservative figures VR has to at least do \"ok\" for NVDA to grow at all.
