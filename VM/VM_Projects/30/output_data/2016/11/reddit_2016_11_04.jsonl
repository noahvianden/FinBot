{"title": "It's time to cash out on NVDA", "selftext": "I've been following NVDA since April. We can all agree this stock has been exceptionally good the past few months. Though it definitely looks like the momentum is coming to an end.\n\nFor starters [the 200 day moving average is starting to cross the 50 day moving average](http://i.imgur.com/y4CC6NH.jpg) You can also see that the RSI is losing momentum. Along with that the new high did not match previous highs when reaching the line of resistance.\n\nNot only are there a lot of bearish indicators but notable people within the company have sold shares.[Including their CEO](http://reviewfortune.com/2016/11/01/which-way-nvidia-corporation-nasdaqnvda-insiders-are-heading-5/)\n\nNow I love NVDA they have been absolutely wonderful. What has me conflicted is many analyst still rate NVDA as a buy or hold. Only Wells Fargo rates it as a sell but who can trust those mother fuckers anymore?\n\nAlong with that I can't tell if the decline it has faced this past week is just the markets reaction to the upcoming election. To be fair the whole market last week has be relatively down.\n\nI'm up like 90% roi on nvda and if I've learned anything from you nut cases it's to get out when your all buttered up.\n\n[I stumbled upon this article as I was typing this](http://investorplace.com/2016/11/nvidia-corporation-nvda-stock-earnings-trade-iplace/#.WByGuxkpDqA) This says they are scheduled to report earnings on the 10th. This is also the second article I've come across that has warned of a reversal in an otherwise sea of good NVDA news.\n\nEdit: let this post die pls.
