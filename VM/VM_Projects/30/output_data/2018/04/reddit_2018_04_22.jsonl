{"title": "Significant Insider Trading Activity (Last 7 Days)", "selftext": "\n\nThis is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.\nThe SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares. In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public, insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good track record at timing their purchases.\n\n## Largest Insider Buying (Last 7 Days)\nCompany|Count|Direct Changed|Indirect Changed|Total Changed\n--------|-----:|-----:|-----:|--------:  \n[AKCA / Akcea Therapeutics Inc.](https://fintel.io/n/us/akca)|1|18,666,666|0|18,666,666 \n[EYEG / Eyegate Pharmaceuticals Inc.](https://fintel.io/n/us/eyeg)|5|13,358,198|0|13,358,198 \n[PRLX / Parallax Health Sciences Inc.](https://fintel.io/n/us/prlx)|4|8,500,000|0|8,500,000 \n[VRML / Vermillion, Inc.](https://fintel.io/n/us/vrml)|2|0|4,945,864|4,945,864  \n[MATN / Mateon Therapeutics, Inc.](https://fintel.io/n/us/matn)|3|1,125,000|0|1,125,000  \n[ETM / Entercom Communications Corp.](https://fintel.io/n/us/etm)|2|431,838|0|431,838   \n[VSI / Vitamin Shoppe, Inc.](https://fintel.io/n/us/vsi)|1|0|156,142|156,142 \n[CERC / Cerecor Inc.](https://fintel.io/n/us/cerc)|1|150,000|0|150,000 \n[LGCY / Legacy Reserves LP](https://fintel.io/n/us/lgcy)|1|119,815|0|119,815 \n[OPK / Opko Health, Inc.](https://fintel.io/n/us/opk)|5|0|115,000|115,000 \n[JILL / J.
