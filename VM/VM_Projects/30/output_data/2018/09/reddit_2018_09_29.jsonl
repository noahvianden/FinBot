You wish.\n\n>Short seller activism is generally associated with prominent hedge funds and \u201ccelebrity\u201d activists, such as David Einhorn and Bill Ackman. These short sellers often launch short attacks capitalizing on their notoriety and name recognition. [1] In recent years, however, a new breed of short activism has emerged: individuals who anonymously post negative research reports and articles about targeted public companies on widely followed online financial and research platforms, such as Seeking Alpha. According to Activist Insight, \u201cactivist short sellers are more often than not anonymous entities and funds.\u201d [2]\n\n>Unlike the typical investor, a short seller seeks to take advantage of bear markets and profit from the decline in a company\u2019s stock price. Short attacks are most effective where long investors lose confidence in their own appraisal of a stock\u2019s value. This most commonly happens when a company\u2019s financial position is complicated, when a new industry or product is being valued, when a government investigation is disclosed to or suspected by the market, or when other forces create ambiguity in the valuation.\n\n>Under current regulations, investors are not required to disclose short positions, making it difficult for companies and the market to track the existence of short sellers and monitor their activity. [3] The inherent anonymity of the internet exacerbates these challenges. As long as online short activists have access to the internet, they can theoretically launch a short attack that reaches millions of investors from anywhere at any time\u2014and with little accountability. [4]\n\n>Until recently, the market dismissed anonymous short activists as illegitimate and not credible, as \u201creal\u201d short sellers with legitimate claims do not hide behind fake pseudonyms and aliases. [5] That premise has been proven wrong. Anonymous short sellers can be, and often are, disguised prominent hedge funds and individuals. For example, in December 2015, a short seller using the pseudonym \u201cInvestors for Truth\u201d published an anonymous report about United Development Funding IV (\u201cUDF\u201d) on the investing websites Harvest Exchange and Value Investors Club, causing UDF\u2019s stock price to plummet 35%. After much speculation, Kyle Bass, founder of Hayman Capital Manager, eventually claimed responsibility for the articles posted under the pseudonym Investors for Truth. [6] Such prominent short activists have incentive to post under pseudonyms in order to protect against litigation and reputational risk in the event of public or company backlash, and to protect their bets against premature public exposure.\"\n\nLuckily, if Elon is found guilty, prosecuting these criminals will be much easier.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Where's the part that supports the idea that saying things which are negative yet not false about a company is illegal when short?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Everywhere, if you are not reducing to the absurd.

You wish.\n\n>Short seller activism is generally associated with prominent hedge funds and \u201ccelebrity\u201d activists, such as David Einhorn and Bill Ackman. These short sellers often launch short attacks capitalizing on their notoriety and name recognition. [1] In recent years, however, a new breed of short activism has emerged: individuals who anonymously post negative research reports and articles about targeted public companies on widely followed online financial and research platforms, such as Seeking Alpha. According to Activist Insight, \u201cactivist short sellers are more often than not anonymous entities and funds.\u201d [2]\n\n>Unlike the typical investor, a short seller seeks to take advantage of bear markets and profit from the decline in a company\u2019s stock price. Short attacks are most effective where long investors lose confidence in their own appraisal of a stock\u2019s value. This most commonly happens when a company\u2019s financial position is complicated, when a new industry or product is being valued, when a government investigation is disclosed to or suspected by the market, or when other forces create ambiguity in the valuation.\n\n>Under current regulations, investors are not required to disclose short positions, making it difficult for companies and the market to track the existence of short sellers and monitor their activity. [3] The inherent anonymity of the internet exacerbates these challenges. As long as online short activists have access to the internet, they can theoretically launch a short attack that reaches millions of investors from anywhere at any time\u2014and with little accountability. [4]\n\n>Until recently, the market dismissed anonymous short activists as illegitimate and not credible, as \u201creal\u201d short sellers with legitimate claims do not hide behind fake pseudonyms and aliases. [5] That premise has been proven wrong. Anonymous short sellers can be, and often are, disguised prominent hedge funds and individuals. For example, in December 2015, a short seller using the pseudonym \u201cInvestors for Truth\u201d published an anonymous report about United Development Funding IV (\u201cUDF\u201d) on the investing websites Harvest Exchange and Value Investors Club, causing UDF\u2019s stock price to plummet 35%. After much speculation, Kyle Bass, founder of Hayman Capital Manager, eventually claimed responsibility for the articles posted under the pseudonym Investors for Truth. [6] Such prominent short activists have incentive to post under pseudonyms in order to protect against litigation and reputational risk in the event of public or company backlash, and to protect their bets against premature public exposure.\"\n\nLuckily, if Elon is found guilty, prosecuting these criminals will be much easier.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Where's the part that supports the idea that saying things which are negative yet not false about a company is illegal when short?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Everywhere, if you are not reducing to the absurd.
