{"title": "Berkshire DD ahead of earnings", "selftext": "Warren stated a few years ago that even though he's against the idea of using C&CE to distribute a dividend or buyback shares, there would be one exception to that rule - when Price/Book is below 1.3. This week, P/B dipped to 1.28 according to Bloomberg. Given that Berkshire right now has $120bn in cash, the time for buybacks might be right around the corner, which would cause the stock to soar. Buybacks decrease the number of shares outstanding and aren't taxable, since they don't result in shareholder distributions. Warren is very sensitive to tax considerations and his shareholders' return experience, so this is a likely route. \n\nOn the other hand, he doesn't have to go the buyback route. The other options are pursuing M&A, issuing dividend, or just holding on to his treasury bills. Warren Buffett's T-Bill portfolio is by far the biggest on the street. His stockpile is so big that institutions trade with Berkshire for the sheer liquidity. This is a source of revenue for the company. A much larger windfall though has to do with rising rates. 12 Month rates started 2017 at around 0.8%. Since then yields have exploded as inflation and economic expectations have picked up, and they are yielding 2.2%. On $100bn, 0.8% would get Berkshire $800mm a year in pure profit. At 2.2% this increases to $2.2bn straight to the bottom line. As yields continue to rise and more cash accumulates, this will impact earnings. \n\nM&A is also a very viable option. Earnings have increased by 20% YoY for most S&P constituents, but price has remained level to down since the start of the year. Bloomberg has the 1 year forward P/E at around 16, as the numerator is decreasing and the denominator increases. If we close the year flat and P/E next year is between 16-17, companies are much more reasonably valued and an acquisition would definitely be accretive. \n\nLastly comes dividends. I don't think in Buffett's lifetime we will see the announcement of a regular dividend. He prefers to accumulate cash to have enough liquidity to make any size acquisition he pleases. The company has no net debt and one of the lowest risks of default of any company on Bloomberg. We may however have a one time special dividend of around 10%, though I again think this is unlikely given how valuations have stopped expanding. \n\nFinancials have sold off a little recently and so have insurers on the back of AIG's dismal earnings. I think this is temporary however as financials/insurers benefit from higher volatility and higher rates. A lot of Berkshire isn't even insurance though, it's railroads and other companies. In 2017 insurance counted for 27% of total revenue, and the rest was diversified among dozens of child companies. The company is very well diversified and primed for outperformance in the future.
