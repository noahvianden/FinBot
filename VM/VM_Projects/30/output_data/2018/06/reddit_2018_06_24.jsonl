{"title": "Any thoughts on JD, China\u2019s No. 2 Ecommerce Site", "selftext": "I feel like JD.com is about to blow and it\u2019s current $40 stock price is a steal.  I noticed Google just invested $550 million in this vastly growing site and I think they could be head-to-head with Alibaba (China\u2019s no. 2 ecommerce website). Granted Alibaba has a market cap of $550 billion (10x JD\u2019s current market cap of $50 billion), JD has still maintained the same level of growth as Alibaba over the past 5-6 years of 3x growth. The only problem I see with JD.com is their profit-earning ratio has been in the negative but Amazon experiences the same thing early on and during the recession. JD\u2019s strategy is very similar to Amazon but JD is just beginning to get started. I could see JD getting a $200-$250 billion market cap, resulting in half the value of Alibaba and a $200 price up from today\u2019s steal of $40. Ecommerce is the future. Amazon is the future so companies like Alibaba and JD have tremendous long term potential especially in a Chinese market as China eyes being the world\u2019s largest economy. I am an independent investor and have no connection with any of these companies, just wondering on everyone\u2019s thoughts including any other potential Ecommerce companies for the next 5 years. I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s too late for Amazon and see them $3K-$5K per share in the next 5 years. Any thoughts are appreciated.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/18/google-to-invest-550-million-into-chinas-jd-com.html", "id": "8tljqg", "created_utc": 1529879875.0, "score": 100, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "Yeah.
