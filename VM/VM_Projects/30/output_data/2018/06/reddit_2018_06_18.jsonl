In addition to selling stuff online, Amazon now publishes books, extends credit, sells online ads, designs clothes, and produces movies and TV shows. It is also one of the world\u2019s largest providers of cloud storage and computing power.\" \n\n\"These two practices\u2014predatory pricing and integration across business lines\u2014may sound normal. But under old readings of U.S. antitrust law, they are illegal.\"\n\n\"And then, in 1978, a Yale Law professor named Robert Bork promoted a clean new theory of antitrust law, inspired by the libertarian Chicago school of economics. \n Bork decreed that all antitrust suits should be judged by one question: What will most lower prices for consumers?\"\n\n\"And predatory pricing? It is \u201ca phenomenon that probably does not exist,\u201d [Bork] wrote. The Chicago school, he said, had proved that companies would always pursue short-term profits over long-term growth.  Amazon\u2019s history seems to belie this claim.\"\n\n\" ' When a company comes to monopolize a market\u2014when it grows so big that it can threaten other industries just by entering them\u2014it ceases to be merely a company. It becomes an institution so powerful that it can rule over people like a government. That was the insight of Brandeis,' \u201d [Khan said].\n\n\n---\n\nFurther reference:  \nAmazon's Antitrust Paradox    \nLina M.
