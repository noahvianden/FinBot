{"title": "Is there an edge to selling premium when implied vol is high?", "selftext": "Selling premium when implied volatility is high is considered by many traders to be an obvious play. It appears to be a valid approach, given that volatility is mean reverting and the credit received is higher. Rather than take this at its word, I wanted to test, empirically, whether there's actually any edge to this approach.\n\nI used SPX options from Jan 2013 \\- May 2018 with approximately 20 delta (so \\-20 for puts). The trade I'm looking at here is selling 5 wide call/put spreads exactly 15 days before expiry. I split the data into 4 bins based on the level of VIX when the trades were opened. There were about 100 points in each bin. That's not a whole lot of data, but I thought the results make sense intuitively and were interesting enough to share. In the below plots, the x axis is the range for each VIX bin.\n\nFirst off, the following claims are definitely valid:\n\n1. You receive higher credit on a 20 delta spread if you sell when implied vol is high, as evidenced by [these](https://i.imgur.com/yM74bmM.jpg) [plots](https://i.imgur.com/SKenfFV.jpg).\n\n2. The higher the vol, the further your 20 delta short strikes are from the spot price when you enter the trade, as shown in [these](https://i.imgur.com/oTYtm9U.jpg) [plots](https://i.imgur.com/ZRBb3Vm.jpg).\n\nThe [final](https://i.imgur.com/z2LwlmP.jpg) [plots](https://i.imgur.com/Tg7UZlQ.jpg) show the empirical probability of your short strike being hit during the length of the contract. I consider this to be a more relevant measure than the assignment probability, given that we'd usually cut our losses if our short strike is hit sometime before expiry. \n\nThis is my conclusion \\- it's much more likely that your short strike will be hit if you sell premium when implied vol is high. It doesn't really matter that your strike is further away from the spot price when you enter the trade. The higher credit you receive is basically compensation for the higher likelihood of your strike being hit. It's a testament to market efficiency. I'd even go so far as to say that any edge you have is based primarily on your trade management skills, regardless of the implied vol. \n\nGiven this information, do you still think there's any edge to selling premium when implied vol is high?\n\nAs a side note, the plots also show that it's a terrible idea to sell call spreads when vol is very low.", "id": "8qgj9a", "created_utc": 1528782428.0, "score": 2, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "I'll start off by saying that I have a lot of respect for TastyWorks and Tom, who I learned how to trade options from with the webinars on ThinkorSwim during the early 2000's. I would not be here where I am today if it wasn't for him. With that, I will say that I feel that TastyWorks has created this overgeneralization about vol which is an extremely complex and not well understood concept by most options traders. \n\nYou bring up a very good point and we've found similar results when we were backtesting covered call strategies on S&P 500 Stocks over the past trading years (2007\\-2017). We had over 6000 data points in our backtests for each particular strategy and we tested hundreds of them. Markets are quite efficient from what we've found and I think what you've found is that while selling credit spreads during high vol gives you decent exposure to Vega, it is still very small in comparison to your Delta exposure which will have a much bigger impact on your trading. As you pointed out, what causes you to get stopped out is a move in the underlying, not a move in implied vol. Just calculate your profit/loss if vol drops by 25&#37; vs the underlying moving a few percentage points, and see which one provides more profit/loss to your strategy. Moreover, being short Vega in theory means that you think Vol is going to move lower, which if you're only scanning just for periods of high implied vol, doesn't necessarily tell you that at all. It's only putting probabilities in your favor which is fine since vol is mean reverting, but I would say is a crude trading strategy. That's like shorting all stocks that are above it's Bollinger band without looking at any other factors. Vol of Vol for example, is an indicator that vol traders will look at to provide some views on the direction of volatility. If you look at institutional vol funds that trade this strategy, they do not just sell 20 Delta Calls/Puts or Spreads when vol is high and hope that vol goes lower and delta doesn't wipe out their trade, they have very calculated Vega and Delta exposure based on their models for both where they think implied vol is headed and where they think the underlying is headed.
