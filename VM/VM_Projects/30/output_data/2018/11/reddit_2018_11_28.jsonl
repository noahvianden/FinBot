{"title": "What it costs Tesla to borrow money vs. Ford, GM, and Toyota", "selftext": "Most people don't look at bonds very often because bonds are complicated, hard to trade, and can't make you rich quickly. Boring people who work at banks, insurance companies, pensions, buy bonds. \n\nTelsa's bonds, by law, have basically 0 retail investors buying and selling them, since they are Rule 144A bonds that can only be bought by \"[qualified institutional buyers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rule144a.asp)\" or QIBs. Individual investors in the U.S. couldn't buy them if they wanted to.\n\nIf you can't buy them, you should still watch how they trade. \n\nBond prices are based on:\n\n1. Risk-free rates. The U.S. Treasury can print money, so it won't default on its debt. Companies always borrow at a premium to the risk free rate because a company can't just print more USD to pay back debt.\n\n2. The risk or probability of default. What are the odds that the company cannot repay its obligations in the future? A company that is more likely to default will pay more to borrow money. \n\n3. The loss given default. Assuming a company defaults on its bonds, how much will a bondholder receive if the company is liquidated? If two bonds have an equal probability of default, but one has assets that will return 90% of creditors' money, and another will only return 10% of a creditors' money, the former is less risky than the latter. It's kind of like how a mortgage at 50% of the home's value is less risky than a mortgage at 99% of a home's value.\n\nWhen you compare bonds, you have to make sure to compare them to similar bonds. That means bonds that mature at roughly the same time, and have similar characteristics (unsecured vs. secured, issued by the parent company vs. issued by a subsidiary).\n\n\nAutomaker | Yield-to-Maturity | Maturity Date | Source | \n:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | \nToyota | 3.86% | 7/20/2028 | [link](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/BondDetail.jsp?ticker=C769797&symbol=TM4654837) | \nGeneral Motors | 5.07% | 4/1/2025 | [link](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/BondDetail.jsp?ticker=C620023&symbol=GM4181482) | \nFord | 6.32% | 11/15/2025 | [link](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/BondDetail.jsp?ticker=C32037&symbol=F.GM) | \nTesla | 7.98% | 8/15/2025 | [link](http://finra-markets.morningstar.com/BondCenter/BondDetail.jsp?ticker=C705185&symbol=TSLA4530906) | \n\nThe market, right or wrong, believes Toyota's bonds are the least risky. They have the lowest [yield to maturity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yieldtomaturity.asp) even though they have the greatest amount of time until the bonds mature and investors are repaid.\n\nToyota doesn't have many unsecured bonds outstanding, so I had to pick one that matures a few years later than the bonds of Ford, General Motors, or Tesla. Toyota's low debt outside of its financing arm probably explains its bonds' low yield. Japanese businesses are known worldwide for using very little debt. Toyota falls in line.\n\nFord is having a lot of problems, so its bond yields have increased in the past few months. The company stopped selling cars (minus the Mustang) to focus on gas guzzling trucks and SUVs. Its bonds trade at a high yield of 6.3%! Moody's [downgraded](https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-downgrades-Ford-ratings-to-Baa3-outlook-is-negative--PR_388144) its bonds to one notch above \"junk\" in August. \n\nGeneral Motors is in the middle. It got rid of a lot of debt when it filed for bankruptcy, making the \"new GM\" less risky than the old GM. But it's making changes too, closing factories and abandoning many of its sedans. The bond market wants a 5.07% yield to maturity to buy its debt.\n\nTesla is an outlier. At a YTM of 7.98%, its investors require more than 2x the return to buy Tesla bonds vs. Toyota's. This could be because the market expects that, if Tesla were liquidated, the unsecured bonds wouldn't recover much, since most of its hard assets (inventory, factory, and so on) are pledged to other lenders first.
