Guidance can be just as important, or more important in certain cases, than earnings. Example is GEs recent earnings release beat, but had lowered future guidance.\n\n**Volume of buyers** If a huge investing company owns a shit ton of shares and wants to exit the position, they have to have enough buyers otherwise it will actually affect the stock price majorly. Some stocks don't have enough buyers until good earnings are released. When good earnings are announced, they know many buyers will be available and the investing company or whoever has a large position will dump their shares. This reason I am the least educated on so I'm not 100% sure if it stagnates the stock price, causing other investors to panic sell, or what, but I do know sometimes big positions get dumped after a good ER.\n\n**Buy the rumor sell the news**. Many investors buy early (maybe a few weeks to months) beforehand, knowing the stock will run up until earnings because everyone knows they will beat earnings. Once earnings is beat, these people cash in on the price pop. I think this reason is more prominent during scarcity in the market. For example we have been in a big bull run and tech stocks have been rising extremely fast. Some people think many tech stocks are overpriced so they just want to play the run up, take profits, and GTFO.
