This only keeps up if they perform on the software and hardware side. If and when they have a \"Vista\" moment people will jump ship. At the very least they will shop around and many will be amazed at what they can get outside of Apple's world.\n\nApple also must generate overseas sales to continue to grow. They are not retaining customers abroad nearly as readily as they are in the US. In part this is due to the fact in some countries the new iPhones are pushing near (or over) $2,000USD once you add in the exchange rate plus taxes. That is alot of money to ask of anyone. It will help Apple's bottom line but it most certainly will limit expanding their userbase.\n\nLet me be clear, I don't think Apple will burn into the ground. I simply think they are overweight in stock price currently. They are also very exposed if Trump adds on final tariffs to all Chinese imports (something I expect he will roll out post-midterms).
