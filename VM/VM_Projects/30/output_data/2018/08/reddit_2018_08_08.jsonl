{"title": "Is MSFT really a good long term investment?", "selftext": "Microsoft has always been a growth and innovative engine. \n\nFrom the DOS to Windows platform, to MS Office to the Xbox, they\u2019ve dominated the computer industry since the beginning. \n\nBut Microsoft lost the mobile war, and unfortunately, mobile devices are replacing PCs. Yes, they have the surface pro. But the Surface pro marketshare pales in comparison to IPhones and IPads. \n\nThey do have a good CEO - but is this company innovating enough for long term growth? \n\n-Xbox lost the war to Sony this generation. On top of that, mobile gaming is becoming a more and more popular experience. Add even to that, the emergence of Virtual Reality from other competitors such as the Occulus Rift make for a shaky Xbox future. They may be able to ride the storm, but that remains to be seen. \n\n-Microsoft Office (mainly excel and PowerPoint) still reign supreme in business applications. But with IPads slowly creeping into the white collar workspace, there is a chance Google or Apple develop a product of similar quality. Office is also heavily dependent on PC usage, which has been in a decline for years. \n\n-They\u2019ve made some moves to migrate to the cloud. But I just don\u2019t see them beating out Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud. Both companies have enough operating capital to undercut Microsoft in this space and capture the majority of the marketshare. \n\nSo 5-10 years from now, where do we see MSFT? PCs will be more scarce then ever.

We are at a very early cycle of the move to the cloud. Nearly all medium-to-large size, non-tech companies still have data centers and are either moving them or making plans to move them to the cloud. Azure's IAAS offering (infrastructure as a service) will be a likely choice for companies that wish to move to the cloud and have a lot of apps running on Windows, but don't want to rewrite all their apps to do so. (Lift-and-shift model, vs creating 'cloud-native' apps.) The install-base of .NET applications in corporate America is huge. Many CIOs with their MSFT enterprise licenses are going to want the security of moving to a familiar platform, and keeping many of their skillsets within the organization viable. I have friends in many companies, and Azure is being used in most of them, and most moves to it are not cloud-native. I only know of one company among my contacts who is using a cloud provider other than AWS, Azure or Oracle Cloud. Only one of them is using Google's cloud. More than a few companies I know are using multiple cloud providers, as they explicitly don't want vendor lock-in. Others are still in that early stage and still learning which ones I like best. I think we have a solid 10 years of massive cloud growth across all of the companies. I personally have no fears about either MSFT or AMZN, as their cloud numbers are going to be blow outs for years to come.\n\nOn the dev side (I'm a developer for 20+ years) Microsoft has made insane moves to win back developers. Their Visual Studio Code IDE is a massive hit. They've been a huge open source contributor lately. They are adding support for non-Windows devices. The adoption appears to be low, but some of their latest frameworks (.NET Core) blow the doors performance-wise off of some competing technologies, such as Node.js. As these mature, and continue to add cross-platform support, and get awesome tooling with VS Code, I expect them to continue to win back developer mind-share.\n\nMost of Microsoft's money comes from businesses, corporations. (Not Xbox...) These companies don't want to mess around: they want support. CIOs and CTOs want to have licenses and support agreements in place where they can get rapid resolution to problems. Despite moves to the cloud, I don't see many competitors (other than the ones already there...Oracle, IBM, etc...) in the space of offering what Microsoft does now to corporate customers. Companies are going to continue to spend on Windows, Office 365, Skype, and the lot because it's a low risk proposition to those making the decisions, especially for medium-to-large size businesses. \n\nIf you aren't seeing the innovation at Microsoft ever since Satya took over I don't think you've really been paying attention.\n\nFinally, Microsoft is still sitting on a mountain of cash. They are positioned as well as anyone to dominate for years to come. I think Microsoft and Amazon are the two strongest positioned cloud companies moving forward. Google unfortunately has a really bad reputation of killings things off, quickly, without much notice. (Google Translate API, Google Reader, etc...) They also have a really spotty hardware history. (Google 'bricked nexus' or 'bricked pixel'.) I'm personally taking a very 'wait-and-see' approach to Google's cloud offering. I don't think it is nearly as important to them as it is to MSFT or Amazon, since they are still primarily an advertising company. I own GOOGL as well, but not because of seeing them as a threat to MSFT or AMZN.
