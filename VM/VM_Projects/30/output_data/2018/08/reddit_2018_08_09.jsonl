{"title": "Musk Mystery Enters Day 3 as Pressure to Show the Money Mounts", "selftext": "[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-08/tesla-take-private-skepticism-grows-after-musk-s-funding-claim](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-08/tesla-take-private-skepticism-grows-after-musk-s-funding-claim)\n\nWall Street and Washington have the same question for [Elon Musk](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1954518): Where\u2019s the money?\n\nTwo days after he vowed on Twitter that he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d for a spectacular $82 billion deal to take [Tesla Inc.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/TSLA:US) private, he has offered no evidence to back up the statement. No one has stepped forward publicly -- or privately -- to say they\u2019re behind the plan. People with or close to 15 financial institutions and technology firms who spoke on the condition of anonymity said they weren\u2019t aware of financing having been locked in before Musk\u2019s tweet.\n\nAll of which could be problematic as the [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/13165Z:US) starts investigating the matter. Regulators have asked the company if what Musk tweeted was factual and why such a disclosure was made via social media rather than in a filing, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter. Judith Burns, an SEC spokeswoman, declined to comment. Tesla also declined to comment.\n\n\u201cWhen Musk tweeted this, was he saying this was something that was definitely going to happen? Something that might happen?\u201d said Ira Matetsky, a partner at Ganfer & Shore in New York, outlining questions the SEC might ask. \u201cHow would a reasonable investor interpret that and was it consistent with the facts as they existed at the time?\u201d\n\n### \u2018I Wish\u2019\n\nTesla fell 0.8 percent to $367.50 in trading before U.S. exchanges opened Thursday -- well below the $420 at which Musk said shareholders would be bought out.\n\nThe chief executive officer raised the go-private possibility with the board last week, according to a [statement](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PD584M3RXUKG) from six of Tesla\u2019s nine directors. They said he had \u201caddressed the funding for this to occur,\u201d without providing details.\n\nAs for Tesla shareholders, Musk said in one of his Twitter posts that [\u201cinvestor support is confirmed\u201d](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/terminal/PD3VSGAIBMDC) for his plan. The largest shareholders declined to comment. At the California State Teachers\u2019 Retirement System, which as of March owned about 213,000 shares, spokeswoman Michelle Mussuto said there was no advance warning.\n\n\u201cWe have not been contacted by Tesla IR,\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t reach out before the tweet either.\u201d\n\nLeaving the public marketplace isn\u2019t a new vision for Musk, who told Rolling Stone in an interview [published](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/elon-musk-the-architect-of-tomorrow-120850/) in November, \u201cI wish we could be private with Tesla. It actually makes us less efficient to be a public company.\u201d\n\nIn April 2017, when Musk held talks with [Masayoshi Son](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/id/1455295) about [SoftBank Group Corp.](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/9984:JP) investing in the electric carmaker, they touched on the possibility of fulfilling Musk\u2019s wish, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. The [talks](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-08-08/musk-is-said-to-have-talked-with-softbank-about-tesla-investment) failed to progress due to disagreements over ownership and have not started up again.", "id": "95wexb", "created_utc": 1533821159.0, "score": 79, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "$420 stock price\n6 out of 9 board members commenting\nAka 69\n\nMusk is literally just memeing at this point ", "score": 11, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3980102837085724}, {"body": "We're playing this short trade using options to limit our risk, but TSLA is sliding on this lack of follow up and I bet Musk has to keep quiet publicly even if the SEC isn't really investigating this.

{"title": "$TSLA to Mars - DD inside", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I know jack shit about stocks and am talking out of my ass.\n\nOkay so let's take a look at Papa Musk. He's says a lot of shit, but he's no liar. He tweeted that he'd put his fucking car in space. People laughed. What did he do? **He put his fucking car in space.** And right now, it's [past Mars orbit](http://www.whereisroadster.com/). So then he said he was going to put *motherfucking* thrusters on the 2020 Roadster and sell it to the public. People laughed. Then he revealed he's serious, and a SpaceX package will include several goddamn thrusters powered by compressed air in a SpaceX-developed COPV. You know what else he tweeted? That's right. He straight up told us: [the fucking short burn of the century](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/992388944774938626?lang=en). Now he's laid out exactly what how it's going down, but first, let's take a look at other short burns this century. Oh yeah, there's that time that Porsche executed such a [beautiful short squeeze](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen/short-sellers-make-vw-the-worlds-priciest-firm-idUSTRE49R3I920081028) that they also briefly drove the share price up 5x, making VW the most valuable company in the world (on paper), and *caused a fucking billionaire short seller [to commit suicide](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-merckle-newsmaker-sb-idUSTRE5055O820090106)*. Now, Musk has laid out how he's going to execute an even grander short squeeze: allow and encourage stock holders to not sell their stock, with the promise of even greater riches in the future. Normally, when a company is bought out, stockholders are forced to sell at a specific price, so if a short seller offers even a penny over, it's a better deal. Not this time, fuckers. In a completely unprecedented move that analysts have no fucking clue how it will work, public shares will be converted to private shares. In the last day that TSLA is public, it's going to fucking skyrocket as the shorts scramble to cover their positions. TSLA will be the most valuable company in the world briefly, and guess what? Papa Musk owns 20%. Who does Musk really want to give the middle finger to even more than the shorts? That's right, fucking Bezos. The goddamn Beez. Fuckin' Beez, man. Lording it over Musky with his $150 billion fortune. Musk has engineered this whole damn thing to ensure that TSLA skyrockets so high that not only does he beat Bezos, but fuck it, why not Andrew Carnegie too ($372 billion), to become the richest fucker in modern history? That's right: TSLA is going to be worth $2T, meaning each share will hit **$11,000**. Take out a loan against your house, take out a loan against your grandma's house, take out a loan against your neighbor's house, sell your organs, do whatever you need to do and put all your fucking money in TSLA.

The meat and potatoes of this is that they are screwing over large customers who have what they call \"enteprise agreements\" that give them better discounts and more flexible license options, price locks, deploy now pay later, things like that. They are increasing pricing on specific products anywhere from 10%-30%. This is basically their continued effort to squeeze people in to their pay monthly/yearly per user subscription model because they make more money. As this continues to unfold and large customers who have not yet moved to cloud/subscription model will have their hands forced by Microsoft and basically not have a choice but to do so. MSFT profits are going to soar and we're going to be eating tendies. I do not know how long this will take in terms of seeing it reflected in stock price and revenue, probably a couple of quarters after it is implemented - again October 1st is when the hikes become effective.
