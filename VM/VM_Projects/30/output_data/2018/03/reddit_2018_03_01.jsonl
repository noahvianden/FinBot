As for answering those questions:\n\nI'm not quite sure when I would pull out of the market.

A company that costs $100m should be making $10m at the least for me to be interested.\n\nI like dividends so a dividend higher than interest rates on a 10y-bond are what I look to find.\n\nShares should be getting repurchased, especially if the market has been undervaluing the particular company.\n\n\nI usually go through a mental checklist I\u2019ve formed over dedicating hours to reading investment theory\u2019s and seeing what\u2019s worked in the past over a certain time period.\n\n\nIf this doesn\u2019t sound like something you want to give too much thought into then an index fund tracking the s&p 500 is your best bet. It\u2019s low cost, and the s&p 500 returned over 20% last year, while averaging 10% since inception. Much better than say a treasury bond. \n\nIf you want to be more active in stock buying and see yourself as a business than you\u2019ll make it happen and eventually ask the right questions and learning from your mistakes.
