I don't think the way they do it is going to be ever as efficiently as Tesla since Tesla had the \"opportunity\" to start from scratch with modern/advanced tech, but that's NOT the point I look to defend: \n\nLike Tesla, it's the **batteries** and **charging infrastructure** that stops you from going to \"make as many as we can!!!\" to \"make 25,000 at first, then as we draw down battery costs, install charger infrastructure, and ramp up production efficiencies, we can sacle that to 50k..100k...200k... \" \n\nIf Tesla just kerplunked 250k Model 3s in 2015, the superchargers would be fucked, the service centers would be fucked, and the quality would be fucked (heh. a lot of coverage on questionable quality, but they were incredibly scrutinized with tight deadlines. Porsche's timeline is a little more leisurely). They neeeded to throw so much capex over so many years to get the world ready for this. When they were criticzied for \"burning cash\" they were actually building the backbone for scaling at an unprecedented rate... which is an investment, and not burning cash...at all. \n\nSince Porsche had no interest in teaming up with Tesla RE: Charging, they're basically on their own for infrastructure which is just putting them a good few years behind before they can even consider mass-production.
