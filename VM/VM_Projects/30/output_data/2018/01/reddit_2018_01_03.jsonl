Two of them are specific to Intel hardware (unless you enable the non-default AMD PRO flag for BPF JIT). So the truthiness seems to be that flavor one is widespread, and causes/allows processes to bypass their own bounds, and read their own stuff. This does not allow 'crossing privilege boundaries'. So a VM or an application with a Virtual Memory allocation can disobey rules to read it's own space.\n\n2) In (at least Haswell Xeon, and AMD PRO only if you enable a non-default setting) some Intel hardware (and AMD see before) will allow exploits of a 4GiB range of the kernel virtual memory space. This may be out-of-process allocated space. Meaning, somebody else's VM / host machines keys etc.\n\n3&4) There are further exploits possible on at least Intel Xeon Haswell generation on an \"outdated\" version of Debian (and maybe sub-versioned distros?). It allows for very fast sampling of the of the compromised virtual page space, and even reading kernel memory.\n\nTL;IaF:\nThis is a shit tsunami about to subsume the enterprise world.
