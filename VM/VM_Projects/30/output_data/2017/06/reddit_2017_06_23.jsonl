But what's 1000% on $1? Is it the same as 10% on $100? Is it the same as 1% on $1000?

There are reasons to do each, but knowing you can make the same trade multiple ways, can meet whatever objective is the priority. \n\nBest example I can give is that you buy a stock and it runs on you. Let's say you bought 1000 shares of stock for $5 and the stock. You have $5000 of your original principal + $5000 of gains. It matters not what is principal and what is gains as it's $10000 of capital, period. \n\nYou think the stock is going higher, but what do you do? Leave $10000 at risk? Stupid. \n\nYou sell it all, and buy 10 $5 calls. These will be about $5.00 each. You now have $5000 in cash and $5000 worth of calls with about a 0.98 Delta. \n\nWith the stock you had 1000 delta with $10000 of capital at risk. Now you have 980 Delta but only $5000 at risk. Basically the same position you were in but you got two benefits... \n\n1. Only Original Capital at risk but same economic return as owning stock. \n\n2. Maximum loss is limited to $5000 and is reached at $5. With the stock, the maximum loss $10,000 and the losses continue to accrue down to $0.\n\nHope that helps! \n\n\n\n\n", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.02221788838505745}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.02989373542368412}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.02989373542368412}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.050885844975709915}], "tickers": ["bac"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19648204743862152}, {"body": "this stock is such a bitch. bought more aug $24 calls", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That's not a bad plan...
