A high P/E indicates that future earnings are expected to increase, not fall. \n\nI think that the market has simply priced in future earnings slowing, and an increase in stock price would be the result of an increase in projected future earnings. Of course if that happens and Target gets back into some growth, the stock price will increase, but I personally don't think Target is unfairly valued when you account for their near term outlook.\n\nAnother gamble you're making with target is that they'll aggressively adapt to competition from the likes of Amazon, although I'm beating a dead horse there. Not just in groceries but in electronics, toys, clothing, kitchenware... virtually everything they sell. You can't succeed when you're losing the electronics game to Best Buy, the digital (and soon to be grocery) game to Amazon, and the clothing game to everyone. Who goes into Target to buy Champions branded clothing? (No one)\n\n\nIf you're buying Target now, just like any physical retail sector company, you're betting on management shifting strategy and effectively adapting to the new age of shopping. Will they be able to do it? Maybe - I'd say they have a better shot than many of their peers. I'll have to think about it but I'll probably end up buying some Target. It is a gamble however, because I don't think all of these companies will make it into the new age alive.\n\n\nP.S. Another thing I'm interested in is how Target is rolling out mini stores into metropolitan areas to compete with the likes of Walgreens. I think it's a great idea, these places will be the ones where physical retail will survive the longest. These stores aren't supposed to have any meaningful impact on their bottom line for a while though so it'll be a little until we know how they fare.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "It's a 1% or less decrease per quarter projected in 2017, 2018 is expected to be back to single digit growth and 2019 double digits growth. They are dumping a few billion on this turn around. To me that doesn't justify the huge decline, as it seems like fear.\n\nWhile BBY is doing well they have existed in the same capacity for a long time, the only thing that really got changed is the store in store idea. So im not exactly sure how they will be destroying targets 100x100 ft of electronics.\n\nAnd I touched on WFM, same deal, except owned by Amazon now, who says they won't be using them for autonomous shopping (which GO has been indefinitely delayed anyways due to issues). So what? We see Amazon restructure them somehow in 5 years? Not a reason to drop a discount retailer, but a grocer, sure.\n\nBoth those comments could apply to WMT too.\n\nAnyways I just see it as an overreaction. People see Target as a flop for some reason while Walmart is facing the same deal and is getting by fine. Yeah they are slightly different but it's pretty clear that there is room for general b&m retailers for decades to come.\n\nAs for the small format stores, I haven't seen one in person, so it will be interesting to see what is cut, probably TV's, furniture, bikes, etc but will they cut back on clothes or another department? Also could see them splitting costs and taking CVS with them, as CVS wants cheap premium real estate, especially if Walgreen gets Rite-aide.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Those small format stores really intrigue me.

Should give some people an easy overview.", "id": "6iqf7i", "created_utc": 1498096088.0, "score": 40, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "Don't see how the P/E is unreasonably low if their short/mid term earnings are projected to actually decrease. A high P/E indicates that future earnings are expected to increase, not fall. \n\nI think that the market has simply priced in future earnings slowing, and an increase in stock price would be the result of an increase in projected future earnings. Of course if that happens and Target gets back into some growth, the stock price will increase, but I personally don't think Target is unfairly valued when you account for their near term outlook.\n\nAnother gamble you're making with target is that they'll aggressively adapt to competition from the likes of Amazon, although I'm beating a dead horse there. Not just in groceries but in electronics, toys, clothing, kitchenware... virtually everything they sell. You can't succeed when you're losing the electronics game to Best Buy, the digital (and soon to be grocery) game to Amazon, and the clothing game to everyone. Who goes into Target to buy Champions branded clothing? (No one)\n\n\nIf you're buying Target now, just like any physical retail sector company, you're betting on management shifting strategy and effectively adapting to the new age of shopping. Will they be able to do it? Maybe - I'd say they have a better shot than many of their peers. I'll have to think about it but I'll probably end up buying some Target. It is a gamble however, because I don't think all of these companies will make it into the new age alive.\n\n\nP.S. Another thing I'm interested in is how Target is rolling out mini stores into metropolitan areas to compete with the likes of Walgreens. I think it's a great idea, these places will be the ones where physical retail will survive the longest. These stores aren't supposed to have any meaningful impact on their bottom line for a while though so it'll be a little until we know how they fare.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "It's a 1% or less decrease per quarter projected in 2017, 2018 is expected to be back to single digit growth and 2019 double digits growth.

To me that doesn't justify the huge decline, as it seems like fear.\n\nWhile BBY is doing well they have existed in the same capacity for a long time, the only thing that really got changed is the store in store idea. So im not exactly sure how they will be destroying targets 100x100 ft of electronics.\n\nAnd I touched on WFM, same deal, except owned by Amazon now, who says they won't be using them for autonomous shopping (which GO has been indefinitely delayed anyways due to issues). So what? We see Amazon restructure them somehow in 5 years? Not a reason to drop a discount retailer, but a grocer, sure.\n\nBoth those comments could apply to WMT too.\n\nAnyways I just see it as an overreaction. People see Target as a flop for some reason while Walmart is facing the same deal and is getting by fine. Yeah they are slightly different but it's pretty clear that there is room for general b&m retailers for decades to come.\n\nAs for the small format stores, I haven't seen one in person, so it will be interesting to see what is cut, probably TV's, furniture, bikes, etc but will they cut back on clothes or another department? Also could see them splitting costs and taking CVS with them, as CVS wants cheap premium real estate, especially if Walgreen gets Rite-aide.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Those small format stores really intrigue me.

{"title": "Keep an eye out for Neurometrix. Possible (very likely) buyout and/or expansion.", "selftext": "They have one specific technology that works as a pain relief, but doesn't use meds. It's also FDA approved that it works by sending impulses for your brain to ignore the pain or something like that. Truly revolutionary. \"Why aren't they soaring, then?\" You might ask. The answer is simple: God awful management and because they are constantly being undermined by the pharmacists lobby. \n\n\nThey advertise almost exclusively on Fox News and other dead advertising platform as opposed to advertising it on websites to young people who don't want to use mess (healthy lifestyle and whatnot). And also, I don't think they have even tried to contact those \"Anti Opioid\" organizations, nor politicians that are going directly against the Opioid crisis. Again, I think they haven't done this. They may have, unsuccessfully, which would lead you back to bad management.\n\nTheir product is supposedly great as a cheaper and healthier alternative to Opioids, and according to Amazon reviews they have a somewhat good product- the technology works great but the product design is apparently awful, that's an unanimous opinion among all reviewers.\n\nAnyway, I plan on digging deeper, but so far that's what I've come up with: they have a great technology patented, but they are managing it awfully. So what happens when they have a great parent and awful management? One of two things: Another company steps  in and buys the patent, or another company steps in and buys them out.\n\nEither of the two will certainly boost their minuscule market cap of just $4 Million. Obviously a technology that can overtake the entire opioid market is worth more than $4 Million. That goes back to 'why is it worth so little?', and the answer is, as I said, bad management and being undermined by lobbyists.\n\nNow they can have the greatest tech, but if they don't do anything with it they will keep on being worthless. But the thing that is being overlooked is that they are expanding to Europe. Their multiple-dozen pages long 10K only has the word 'Europe' 15 times or so, that's pathetic. They aren't informing the customers not the investors about their future. Regardless, in Europe they should be able to soar because of the least pharma reliant society they have there. \n\nMy entire DD can boil down to one thing: This technology alone is worth more than their market cap.", "id": "6iud9j", "created_utc": 1498146691.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "tech rallies while im into biotech\n\nbiotech rallies while im into tech\n\nfuck this life yo", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "But since biotech is tech, technically, when tech rallies biotech also does.

The most likely ones being Licensing or Being bought out.\n\nIf they license it, then I'd sell my positions asap after it turns a profit (if they license it will go up for a while, then down when they don't make a significant amount), if they get bought out, then I'll just hold it.
