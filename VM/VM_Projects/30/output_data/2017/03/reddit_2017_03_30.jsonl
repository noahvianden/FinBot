I.e. you essentially buy debt in AUD and if the Aussie housing market crashes their banks will get crushed, the currency will collapse, and you can convert your USDs back to AUDs and pay back the debt for cheap. The Aussies are pretty good at keeping their currency somewhat stable though and they'd just hike interest rates if things got dire. It would probably have to involve a larger, global financial crisis in which case they'd fall into deep recession and the banks would collapse anyway.\n\nThe slowdown in China has already hit AUD/USD pretty hard to the tune of a >25% decline in 4 years and it seems to have bottomed out.
