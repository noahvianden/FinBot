Morgan Early Look at the Market \u2013 Mon 1.9.17\n\nTrading Desk Commentary; For Institutional Investors Only\n\n**PLEASE DO NOT FORWARD THIS DOCUMENT**\n\n#Morning Levels\n\n\u2022 US futures are down 1-2 points\n\n\n\u2022 Asia: Japan Nikkei closed, Japan TOPIX closed, China +0.54%, Hong Kong +0.25%, KOSPI -\n0.02%, Taiwan -0.32%, Australia +0.90%\n\n\u2022 EuroStoxx 50 -0.52%, FTSE +0.17%, DAX -0.45%, CAC -0.68%, Italy -0.90%, Spain -0.55%\n\n\u2022 USD (DXY) up 0.23%, EUR down 0.12%, GBP down 1.00%, JPY down 0.02%, CNY Onshore\n\ndown 0.15%, CNH Offshore down 0.41%, AUD up 0.22%\n\n\u2022 VIX up 5.39% to 11.93\n\n\u2022 Gold up 0.37% to $1,177.18\n\n\u2022 Silver up 0.01% to $16.52\n\n\u2022 Copper down 0.35% to $253.45\n\n\u2022 WTI Crude up 0.58% to $53.18\n\n\u2022 Brent Crude down 1.49% to $56.25\n\n\u2022 Natural Gas down 0.82% to $3.24\n\n\u2022 Corn up 0.07% to $3.59/bu\n\n\u2022 Wheat up 0.12% to $4.26/bu\n\n\n\u2022 Treasuries 2yr yields are down ~0.4bps at 1.206%, 10yr yields are down ~2.4bps at 2.396%\nand 30yr yields are down ~3.1bps at 2.977%\n\n\u2022 Japan 10yr yields 0.046%, down ~0.0bps on the day\n\n\u2022 France 10yr yields 0.804%, down ~2.1bps on the day\n\n\u2022 Italy 10yr yields 1.884%, down ~7.4bps on the day\n\n\u2022 Spain 10yr yields 1.457%, down ~7.6bps on the day\n\n\u2022 Germany 10yr yields 0.286%, down ~0.8bps on the day\n\n#Trading Update\n\n\u2022 Market update \u2013 from the perspective of US equities, it was a quiet weekend and US S&P\nfutures are about flat as a result (Eurozone stocks are off ~40-50bp and Asia ended mixed).\nEco data was solid out of Germany and Taiwan but none of those numbers are altering the\ndomestic narrative (the China Dec FX reserve figures were about inline). On the political\nfront GOP support for the \u201crepeal-without-replace\u201d ACA strategy appears to be waning\n(which is likely neutral for the S&P although could be an indirect positive to the extent it\npreserves political capital for Trump to expend elsewhere such as on tax reform).\n\n\u2022 Calendar \u2013 the focus for Mon 1/9 will be on US consumer credit for Nov (3pmET), a few Fed\nspeakers (Rosengren and Lockhart), some earnings (AYI, CMC, GPN pre-open and APOL,\nCUDA, and WDFC after the close), and conferences (ICR and JPM Healthcare).\n\n\u2022 Eurozone stocks \u2013 the main Eurozone indices are off ~40-50bp. Chemicals, banks,\ninsurance, media, real estate, healthcare, telecoms, and energy are all lagging while autos,\nbasic resources, and tech are outperforming.\n\n\u2022 FX \u2013 the DXY rebounded Fri and that strength is persisting into Mon (the DXY is up ~20bp).\nThe USD is up a lot vs. the GBP (the GBP is down ~100bp) following remarks from PM May\nover the weekend. The CNY/CNH both saw weakness Mon following the China FX data out\nover the weekend.\n\n\u2022 Treasuries \u2013 2yr yields are flattish while 10 and 30yr yields are down ~2 and 3bp.\n\n\u2022 Asia \u2013 trading was relatively quiet in Asia w/Japan closed for a holiday. The other markets\nwere mixed: Hong Kong (Hang Seng +0.25%, HSCEI -0.09%), mainland China (SHCOMP\n+0.54%, Shenzhen +0.3%, CSI 300 +0.48%), Taiwan (TAIEX -0.32%), Korea (KOSPI -0.02%),\nAustralia (ASX 200 +0.9%), and India (down ~10bp for the major indices). There wasn\u2019t a lot\nof major Asia-specific news other than the China Dec FX reserve figures (about inline) and\nthe Taiwan trade figures (which hit after the close and were solid).\n\n\u2022 Hong Kong - Macau was the clear outperformer +2.9% while Cement -0.55% and Coal -0.4%\nlagged. COLI +1.4% moved higher after its project Kai Tak No.1 (II) received ~1,500\nreservations for 125 units available, 11x oversubscribed. HK property names remained well\nbid despite the recent 6-7% rally on demand recovery, technical breakout and improving\nfunding, CKP +0.71% SHK +0.6%. Large dispersion amongst Energy names with Petrochina\nmaking new high +2.3% while CNOOC declined 0.9%. China gas names were well bid after\nmedia reported Air Products has placed a bid to acquire Yindge Gases, all large caps reacted\npositively ENN Energy +4.15% China Res Gas +6.2% China Gas Holdings +5.26%. Macau\nnames put on strong performances driven by external broker comments and ahead of\npositive seasonality (Chinese New Year), Sands +2.67% Wynn +3% Galaxy +4.26%. In the\nfinancials, we saw some risk-off with all Chinese Insurers offered China Life -0.5% CPIC -\n0.54%; at the same time AIA +1.23% outperformed mainly driven by its defensive feature.\nAutos were very active with Geely +3.8% announcing a profit warning (more than double\nthe earnings in FY17) and GWM +1.24% announcing a target of 1.25m units for FY17.\n\n\u2022 South Korea \u2013 Samsung Electronics extended its gains from last week following the Thurs\nnight upside earnings report (up another 2.82%) while Hynix did very well too (up 3.23%).\nThis was offset by weakness elsewhere \u2013 NAVER -2.5%, KEP -2.27%, POSCO -2.4%,\nAMOREPACIFIC -4%, etc.\n\n\u2022 Taiwan \u2013 the TAIEX ended down 0.32%. A lot of the large-cap tech names finished in the\nred (Largan -3.26%, Hon Hai -0.36%, MediaTek -1.36%, Novatek -2.73%, etc) although there\nwere some pockets of green (Quanta +1.99%, Inventec +4.46%, AUO +2.39%, Foxconn\n+0.71%). TSMC ended flat ahead of its earnings later this week.\n\n#Top Headlines for Monday\n\n\u2022 German eco numbers come in solid \u2013 Nov IP came in +2.2% Y/Y (vs. the St +1.9%), exports\n+3.9% (vs. the St +0.5%), and imports +3.5% (vs. the St +1.1%). See JPMorgan takeaways:\nhttp://bit.ly/2i7MJm7\n\n\u2022 German politics \u2013 the SPD, Linke, and Green parties in Germany have outlined the\nconditions by which they would form a coalition. The parties in aggregate have more seats\nthan Merkel\u2019s coalition and thus their alignment could result in a new chancellor for the\ncountry. However, the SPD and Linke have in the past differed materially on certain policies\n(which could complicate any attempt to combine in a coalition). Reuters.\nhttp://reut.rs/2jshXJC\n\n\u2022 Brexit negotiations \u2013 PM May said the UK would make a definitive break w/the EU but\nwants to negotiate the best possible trade deal w/the bloc \u2013 WSJ\nhttp://on.wsj.com/2iTQOfE\n\n\n\u2022 Taiwan \u2013 trade numbers for Dec come in strong (exports +14% vs. the St +10.4% and\nimports +13.2% vs. the St +10%). Bloomberg.\n\n\u2022 Trump/cabinet \u2013 Trump\u2019s management policy in the WH will represent a sharp break from\nthe Obama era. According to Politico, Trump plans on giving his cabinet secretaries and top\naids sig. latitude to run their agencies. Trump also is encouraging his secretaries to \u201cmake a\nsplash\u201d within the first six months of his presidency \u2013 Politico http://politi.co/2iUOOWE\n\n\u2022 Trump/Sessions/immigration \u2013 the Washington Post discusses how the Trump team could\nwind up imposing significant restrictions on the H-1B visa program. Trump and Sessions\nwant to materially overhaul the program and could even scrap it all together. Washington\nPost http://wapo.st/2i9sCXY\n\n\u2022 Corporate tax reform \u2013 Larry Summers criticizes the Ryan/Trump corporate tax proposal in\na Washington Post editorial; while tax reform is crucial, Summers thinks there is a better\nway (Summers sees four problems w/the Ryan/Trump blueprint \u2013 it increases inequality,\nharms certain American business sectors, could spark protectionist measures from other\ncountries, and would threaten entitlements by eroding the tax base) \u2013 Washington Post\nhttp://wapo.st/2i5pv53\n\n\u2022 Fiat Chrysler \u2013 the co said it would invest an extra $1B in the US, creating 2K new jobs in the\nprocess \u2013 FT http://on.ft.com/2iSKwie (the WSJ discusses how auto makers are\nincreasingly in the \u201chot seat\u201d as Trump pressures the industry over production plans\nhttp://on.wsj.com/2iYRkLZ).\n\n\u2022 Dialog Semi has pre-announced preliminary 4Q16 sales of $365m (+5.6% QoQ, -8% YoY),\nbroadly in line with Bloomberg consensus. The underlying cash generation was modestly\nhigher than our estimate. Company hasn't given any commentary on 1Q17 and FY17 \u2013\nUdeshi http://bit.ly/2iUyF3x\n\n#Top Headlines from the Weekend\n\n\u2022 Trump facing economic headwinds and tax doubts \u2013 Politico discusses that while US\ngrowth remains decent, trends are quietly slowing and in contrast to Obama in \u201909 Trump\ntoday is inheriting an economy resting on relatively solid foundations and at/near fullemployment\n(thus while Obama\u2019s record benefited from easy economic comparisons,\nTrump\u2019s will suffer from the opposite set of conditions). Meanwhile, further Fed tightening\nwill act as a headwind while investors are growing increasingly nervous about the fallout\nfrom the GOP tax reform proposal. Politico. http://politi.co/2j2a0aM\n\n\u2022 Growth/inflation risks skewed to the upside \u2013 the latest JPMorgan Global Data Watch\n(from Bruce Kasman) discusses how upside risks are building to the growth and inflation\nforecasts. The clearest case for a positive GDP growth surprise is in the manufacturing\nsector. The improvement in manufacturing aligns with better news on global consumption\nand our global services activity PMI, building the case for stronger global GDP growth. A\nsurge in animal spirits could turn the tide in the direction of sustained stronger growth.\nUpside risks to inflation complement upside growth risks. The global economy isn\u2019t without\nobstacles \u2013 we are mindful of headwinds to EM growth and remain skeptical that US fiscal\npolicy will turn materially stimulative. http://bit.ly/2irBCVX\n\n\u2022 Tax reforms \u2013 the NYT looks at the House GOP corporate tax reform plan. Over time the\nproposal could have virtuous effects on the US economy by encouraging more domestic\nproduction and employment while reducing the reliance on debt. However, those benefits\nwould only accrue over the long-term while implementation of the GOP blueprint (which\nthe NYT calls the most revolutionary overhaul in the history of the corporate tax code) could\ncreate enormous disruptions almost immediately (harming sectors particularly dependent\non imports like retail while strengthening the dollar to such an extent it impacts EMs and\nothers). NYT http://nyti.ms/2jhceCx\n\n\u2022 Retailers face multibillion dollar tax hit under GOP plan \u2013 the WSJ discusses how the\nborder tax adjustments in the GOP plan threatens to cost the retail industry billions \u2013 WSJ\nhttp://on.wsj.com/2iP0s3k\n\n\u2022 Border taxes \u2013 the WSJ notes that the border tax proposal has the support of House\nRepublican leadership but Senators and Trump have yet to definitively weigh in on the\nsubject \u2013 WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2iP0s3k\n\n\u2022 Taxes - Larry Kudlow on CNBC (Fri afternoon at ~3:40pmET) says he is \"worried\" that\nmarkets are too upbeat around tax reform; tax reform details won't be known until the end\nof this year at the earliest and Kudlow thinks there is the risk that companies defer\neconomic activity in anticipation of this legislation.\n\n\u2022 Healthcare \u2013 ACA repeal at risk as four Republicans in the Senate express doubt \u2013 the\nWashington Post notes that four GOP senators have expressed doubt over the ACA repeal\nstrategy which means the party may not have enough votes even for the reconciliation\nprocess. Washington Post http://wapo.st/2jmX8zi (the WSJ http://on.wsj.com/2inrRIv,\nThe Hill http://bit.ly/2jeSdfA, and Politico http://politi.co/2jmYudr also highlight rising GOP\nopposition both in the House and Senate to the ACA repeal-without-replace strategy).\n\n\u2022 Healthcare \u2013 Republicans grapple w/ACA taxes. The GOP is trying to figure out whether to\nscrap the ACA taxes during the repeal process or leave them in place. Removing the taxes\nwould add to the deficit and make it harder to pay for a replacement \u2013 WSJ\nhttp://on.wsj.com/2i1B9J0\n\n\u2022 Obama thinks ObamaCare will survive \u2013 Obama thinks his signature healthcare law will\nremain intact (although it could get a new name). \"It may be called something else. And as\nI said, I don't mind. If in fact the Republicans make some modifications, some of which I may\nhave been seeking previously, but they wouldn't cooperate because they didn't want to --\nmake the system work, and relabel it as Trumpcare, I'm fine with that\u201d \u2013 ABC\nhttp://abcn.ws/2i3b1CH\n\n\u2022 Entitlement reform \u2013 Trump doesn\u2019t want to \u201cmeddle\u201d with Medicare or Social Security\naccording to The Hill. Reince Priebus spoke over the weekend and said Trump intends on\nhonoring his campaign pledge when it comes to entitlements (he won\u2019t pursue entitlement\nreform). Priebus said Trump plans to \u201cshore up\u201d Medicare and Social Security for future\ngenerations by achieving 3-6% economic growth \u2013 The Hill http://bit.ly/2iRJCTr\n\n\u2022 China Dec FX reserve data (numbers out Sat morning 1/7) \u2013 takeaways from JPMorgan\u2019s\nGrace Ng - China\u2019s FX reserves fell by $41.1 billion in December and registered $3.01 trillion\n(J.P. Morgan: 3.025 trillion; consensus: $3.01 trillion). This is the lowest level since March\n2011, and compared to the peak of $3.993 trillion in June 2014. We estimate that capital\noutflows in December were around $55 billion. http://bit.ly/2irrqwK\n\n\u2022 China \u2013 the country\u2019s Vice Finance Minister said he was confident China\u2019s economy grew\n6.7% last year. Growth expanded at a 6.7% pace in Q1-3 and Q4 is expected to have been\nat or above that level \u2013 Reuters http://reut.rs/2i2v8AQ\n\n\u2022 EU breakup risk \u2013 German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel warned that political support for\nthe EU is at its lowest point ever and a break-up of the union is no longer inconceivable. \"I\nonce asked the chancellor, what would be more costly for Germany: for France to be\nallowed to have half a percentage point more deficit, or for Marine Le Pen to become\npresident?\u201d \u2013 Reuters http://reut.rs/2iRs1sP\n\n\u2022 Russia/US \u2013 Reince Priebus said Trump accepts the findings of the US intelligence\ncommunity regarding Russia\u2019s involvement in the US election and the President Elect may\ntake actions in response once he enters office \u2013 Reuters http://reut.rs/2jhEc0P\n\n\u2022 US/NATO \u2013 the US military has vowed to conduct additional training exercises in Europe\nand bolster NATO further in a bit to deter Russian aggression. \"Let me be clear: This is one\npart of our efforts to deter Russian aggression, ensure the territorial integrity of our allies\nand maintain a Europe that is whole, free, prosperous, and at peace\u201d \u2013 Reuters\nhttp://reut.rs/2iWF26E\n\n\u2022 Fund flows \u2013 update from JPMorgan\u2019s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou - inflows to favor equities in\n\u201917 - Q4 equity funds flows increased to close to $90bn worldwide on our estimates, while\nbond fund flows decreased to $40bn. Extrapolating these Q4 flows into this year\nmechanically implies equity fund flows of close to $400bn for 2017 and bond fund flows of\nless than $200bn. http://bit.ly/2iRoVqz\n\n\u2022 Semiconductor M&A \u2013 the White House reiterated its desire to protect American\nsemiconductor IP from foreign buyers amid Chinese goals of dominating the industry;\nrestrictions around investments by Chinese entities in the US semi industry are likely to rise\u2013\nWSJ http://on.wsj.com/2iMsxIB\n\n\u2022 North Korea \u2013 NK on Sun said it could test an ICBM at any time and from any location.\n\"The ICBM will be launched anytime and anywhere determined by the supreme\nheadquarters of the DPRK\u201d \u2013 Reuters http://reut.rs/2irDT3D\n\n\u2022 North Korea \u2013 US Def. Sec threatens to shoot down NK ICBM test - Defense Secretary Ash\nCarter called NK\u2019s nuclear and missile programs a \u201cserious threat\u201d and threatened to shoot\ndown any North Korean ICBM test \"if it were coming towards our territory or the territory of\nour friends and allies\u201d \u2013 Reuters http://reut.rs/2i5zdj2\n\n\u2022 Nigeria \u2013 the Niger Delta Avengers are preparing to resume attacks against facilities as\npeace talks w/the gov\u2019t begin to break down \u2013 Reuters http://reut.rs/2j22koL\n\n#Macro Update\n\u2022 US macro update - sentiment remains quite effusive looking out over the course of the year\nalthough there is nervousness about a near-term digestion pullback (that could coincide\nw/the inauguration on Fri 1/20). The large gap between political expectations and reality is\nthe single biggest cloud hanging over equities but the problem with allowing that chasm to\ninform an overly negative view is: 1) growth (the nominal growth improvement predates\n11/8 by several months and remains in place) and 2) timing (markets appreciate that any\nTrump-linked change won\u2019t be immediate and thus appear willing to give him the benefit of\nthe doubt potentially into the end of the summer).\n\n#Calendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Jan 9\n\u2022 US speakers \u2013 the week of Mon 1/9 has a big lineup of speakers w/Obama\u2019s farewell\naddress on Tues 1/10, Trump\u2019s press conf. on Wed 1/11 (11amET), and a Yellen speech\nThurs night 1/12 7pmET). Trump on Wed will be the most important assuming he holds a\ntrue Q&A-format press conf. and fields questions from a variety of reporters (he hasn\u2019t done\nthis in several months) \u2013 this would help shed light on a variety of topics including ACA\nrepeal/replace, deregulation, tax reform, etc. Yellen\u2019s speech Wed night (7pmET) isn\u2019t likely\nto be a major catalyst.\n\n\u2022 Trump catalysts for the week of 1/9 \u2013 a lot of events coming up w/a slew of confirmation\nhearings and Trump\u2019s press conf. Sessions (AG) confirmation hearing Jan 10-11, Tillerson\n(State) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Pompeo (CIA) confirmation hearing Jan 11, DeVos\n(Education) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Kelly (Homeland Sec) confirmation hearing Jan 11,\nChao (Transportation) confirmation hearing Jan 11, Ross (Commerce) confirmation hearing\nJan 12, Carson (HUD) confirmation hearing Jan 12, and Puzder (Labor) confirmation hearing\nJan 12. More confirmation hearings will be added to the calendar (Price at HHS and\nMnuchin at Treasury will be important). In terms of market-moving news, the ones to\nwatch are Tillerson, Ross, and Puzder; Carson could be interesting but only for FNMA/FMCC\n(technically he will be in charge of both companies). These articles provide some more\ndetails (Washington Post http://wapo.st/2hYBgKd and Politico http://politi.co/2ikW4rx).

The Q4 numbers will prob. be\nsomewhat of an afterthought with investors much more focused on mgmt.\u2019s guidance\ncommentary (impact from higher rates, deregulation, etc.). Also, any deleterious effects of\nhigher rates will be watched closely too (including any softening in loan demand, esp.\nmortgages, credit deterioration, etc.).\n\n#Catalysts for 2017 \u2013 big events to watch for 2017 (preliminary list \u2013 additional events likely to be\nadded)\n\n\n\u2022 ICR consumer conf.
