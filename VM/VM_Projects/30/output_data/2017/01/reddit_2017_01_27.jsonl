{"title": "To those who own GOOG, GOOGL...", "selftext": "If you look back over the past 4 earning releases.  GOOG usually does a run up into earnings, then they release their earnings, which almost always beat on the top and bottom line, and then the stock retraces significantly and this is because they are spending vast amounts of money on moon shot programs and people get concerned.  \n\nThese earnings released today, they beat on the top, but MISSED on the bottom, so I would probably recommend that you sit the next two weeks out. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I love Google and don't like telling people to sell their stock, but just take a two week breather with your profits and then get back in for a cheaper price.  Please look at the charts regarding earnings and the two weeks after earnings release for the past year.  After the two weeks of decay are over, they slowly start their trending upwards again, right into the next quarter release.\n\nThe point I'm trying to make here is if it retraces significantly WITH a beat on the top/bottom usually, I'm not sure HOW significant this retracement will be because they actually missed the bottom.
