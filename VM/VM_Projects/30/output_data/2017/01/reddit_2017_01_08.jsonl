Risking 2.3 to make 1 which is well within my risk profile personally.  POP is 56% and Probability for 50% profit is 73% so the odds are favorable.  Think we can do something better so might adjust a bit.  \n\n2175/2185/2335/2345 nets $305 and max loss $695.  POP is 60% and P50% is 76% so odds are a little better in your favor with a bit better risk profile.  I might stick with this one...the short delta on the call side is .20 and is within 1 SD so a several up days could threaten that side.

POP is 63% and P50% is 77% so again, odds are in your favor for this one.  I'll probably do several contacts.  Maybe 5 for $150 max profit for $350 max loss.  Close out around $75 to keep it mechanical.  This one straddles the 1SD line so I'm comfortable with that.  \n\nSince volatility is pretty damn low I'm still weighing whether to open something up on VXX.  January monthly 21/21.5 short put spread yields $44 profit for $56 loss per contract with POP at 63% and P50 at 67%.  Not bad numbers there if we sell a bunch. I'm thinking since it's basically impossible to predict when volatility will spike maybe a debit spread would be better?  Cheaper if it doesn't work and you can really reap if vol does spike.  For example, same expiry (jan monthly), 23/24 debit call spread 82 profit for 18 loss.  POP is 31% so statistically I'll probably lose but if vol spikes I could secure a good profit.  Lets extend out to February...20/21 short put spread is 94 profit for 106 loss with P50% right around 70% so odds are better here.  Doing it a a little further out gives more time for vol to spike.  But there is risk if it doesn't with the nature of VXX itself.  I'll probably sell a couple of these but hold tight until I see how market reacts monday/tuesday.
