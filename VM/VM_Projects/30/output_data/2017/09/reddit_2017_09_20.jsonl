I'm 100% equity.  \n\n**My belief is in the very long term ( 20-40 years) the market is very difficult to beat.**\n\nSo here is my basic Portfolio:\n\n1. $VOO: S&P500 Index. About 50-60% of my portfolio\n\n2. $VTMGX: International Developed Markets (non-USA). 10-20%\n\n3. Individual Stocks: 10-30%\n\n4. Cash. Remainder. Usually about 5-10%\n\n**For individual stocks, I only invest in 1-3 stocks I feel will totally destroy the market.**\n\nI will only invest in an individual stock if it is grossly undervalued by the market or have massive growth opportunites.  I will not invest in individual stocks that will only slightly beat the market.  And if I can't find any super undervalued stocks or super growth?  Then I don't buy any individual stocks. \n\n**Right now I only hold 2 individual stocks. These are the only stocks I feel has a great chance of destroying the market.**\n\nIn 2013 I bought $AAPL for $60.  I'm still holding many of those shares at $160.  In 2013 AAPL was crazy undervalued and I bought a ton.\n\nThis year in March I purchased $SHOP.  Granted this was a much smaller position than AAPL.  It is about 5% of my portfolio.  I bought at $69.  Now the stock is at $122.  SHOP is all about hyper growth in my portfolio. I truly believe that this stock has a chance to be a 10 bagger in 5-7 years.\n\n**Again I only invest in stocks that I feel will destroy the market. I only buy AAA++ stocks. Then put the rest of my money in market ETF's.**\n\nAnother benefit of only owing 1-3 stocks is I can research the hell out of the companies.  If I owed 30 stocks it would be impossible to have a deep knowledge of all 30 stocks.

I'm 100% equity.  \n\n**My belief is in the very long term ( 20-40 years) the market is very difficult to beat.**\n\nSo here is my basic Portfolio:\n\n1. $VOO: S&P500 Index. About 50-60% of my portfolio\n\n2. $VTMGX: International Developed Markets (non-USA). 10-20%\n\n3. Individual Stocks: 10-30%\n\n4. Cash. Remainder. Usually about 5-10%\n\n**For individual stocks, I only invest in 1-3 stocks I feel will totally destroy the market.**\n\nI will only invest in an individual stock if it is grossly undervalued by the market or have massive growth opportunites.  I will not invest in individual stocks that will only slightly beat the market.  And if I can't find any super undervalued stocks or super growth?  Then I don't buy any individual stocks. \n\n**Right now I only hold 2 individual stocks. These are the only stocks I feel has a great chance of destroying the market.**\n\nIn 2013 I bought $AAPL for $60.  I'm still holding many of those shares at $160.  In 2013 AAPL was crazy undervalued and I bought a ton.\n\nThis year in March I purchased $SHOP.  Granted this was a much smaller position than AAPL.  It is about 5% of my portfolio.  I bought at $69.  Now the stock is at $122.  SHOP is all about hyper growth in my portfolio. I truly believe that this stock has a chance to be a 10 bagger in 5-7 years.\n\n**Again I only invest in stocks that I feel will destroy the market. I only buy AAA++ stocks. Then put the rest of my money in market ETF's.**\n\nAnother benefit of only owing 1-3 stocks is I can research the hell out of the companies.  If I owed 30 stocks it would be impossible to have a deep knowledge of all 30 stocks.
