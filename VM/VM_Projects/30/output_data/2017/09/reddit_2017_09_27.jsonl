Once again it was a slow evening. The US newswires are\nfilled w/previews of today\u2019s big tax unveil but all the major numbers have been circulating\nin the press for several days at least (see full preview below) and thus the actual release\nmay wind up being anticlimactic (note that Thy God-Emperor Trump is due to speak in Indiana on the subject\nat ~3pmET). Keep in mind that the Wed tax blueprint is just the beginning of what will be\na very long and arduous process; while the odds of passing \u201csomething\u201d are relatively good,\nthat \u201csomething\u201d will likely look a lot different from what Republicans will unveil today\n(the GOP plan is too ambitious and will need to be pared down). Overall US politics\ndominated the overnight narrative as Moore won in Alabama (as expected), healthcare dies\n(also as expected), Corker retires (not a complete shock but not fully anticipated),\n\u201cEstablishment\u201d Republicans shutter, Mueller advances, taxes arrive, and more. Eco\ndata/monetary policy was relatively minimal overnight (although the industrial profits\nfigure out of China was positive). The main co-specific news highlights included MU (solid\nQ/guide; only mild neg. was elevated capital spending number but on the whole this was a\nstrong print), NKE (Q was OK but the guide fell short and the stock slumped during the afterhours\nsession), and Alstom/Siemens (they formally announced a merger of their train\noperations). The major Eurozone indices are sitting on decent gains (up ~30-50bp); banks\nare leading on the upside (SX7P up ~1.5%) thanks to the ongoing embrace of reflation\nthemes globally (recall this is a multi-week trading trend). Incidentally, the US BKX advance\nremains very powerful and still has legs \u2013 the sector paused Fri/Mon but is having a hard\ntime sustaining material downside and eked out a small gain on Tues (it seems like this\nlatest BKX rally will be the one to finally break it up and out of its months-long trading\nrange). The major Asian indices were mixed \u2013 TPX -0.5%, NKY -0.31%, Hang Seng +0.47%,\nSHCOMP +0.05%, HSCEI +0.61%, Taiwan TAIEX +0.68%, Korea KOSPI -0.07%, Australia -\n0.12%, and India down ~1.1%. Taiwan\u2019s TAIEX bounced following the US tech rally on Tues\n(Largan +5.5%, Hon Hai +1.45%, TSMC +0.47%, Nanya Tech +4.3%, MediaTek +1.95%, etc.);\nnote that the US tech rally on Tues felt somewhat tentative and it seems like the space has\nmore to go on the downside over the coming days and weeks. US S&P futures are up ~2-4\npoints. The USD continues to rip higher (it\u2019s up another ~40bp this morning) thanks to a\ncombination of Germany (as the election outcome continues to pressure the EUR), tax\nanticipation (even though the tax plan will likely be deficit-negative, the USD is focused for\nnow on its growth implications), and Yellen (as the odds of a Dec hike continue to creep\nhigher).\n* Calendar of events for Wed 9/27 \u2013 the focus will be on US durable goods for Aug\n(8:30amET), US pending home sales for Aug (10amET), Fed speakers (Kashkari, Brainard,\nBullard and Rosengren), the Republican tax plan (Thy God-Emperor Trump to speak on the subject in Indiana\nat ~3pmET), analyst meetings (AMAT, DLPH, KMX, PANW, and SPR), and earnings (ATU preopen\nand JBL, PIR, PRGS, and THO after the close).\n\n#Top Headlines for Wednesday\n\nUS politics \u2013 it was a big night of news as Moore wins, healthcare dies, Corker retires,\n\u201cEstablishment\u201d Republicans shutter, Mueller advances, taxes arrive, and more.\n\n*  Republican tax blueprint \u2013 what to expect on Wed 9/27. It isn\u2019t clear just how\nmuch detail Republicans plan on releasing but the initial rough draft will likely call\nfor 1) bringing the corporate rate down to ~20% (from 35%), 2) cutting the top\n\u201cpass-through\u201d (i.e. small business) rate to 25% (from 39.5%), 3) collapsing the\ncurrent seven individual brackets down to three (new brackets will be 12%, 25%,\nand 35%), 4) cutting the top individual rate to 35% (from 39.5%) although the\nlanguage may allow for the creation of a new top individual rate if Congress needs\nto find extra revenue, 5) a doubling of the individual standard deduction, 6)\neliminating the deductibility of corporate interest expense in some form (the\nlanguage around this topic will probably be vague), 7) immediate expensing of\ncorporate capital expenditures (although this may only be for a ~5 year period), 8) a\n\u201cdeemed\u201d tax on all accumulated overseas earnings (likely at a reduced rate of\n~10%), 9) eliminating the deductibility of state/local taxes on individual returns (it\nsounds like the proposal will retain the deductibility of mortgage interest and\ncharitable donations), and 10) eliminating the estate tax. In total, the plan will call\nfor tax cuts worth ~$5T over 10 years w/Republicans planning on recouping more\nthan half of that lost revenue by eliminating various tax breaks (not all of which will\nbe outlined today). Combined w/dynamic scoring, the net tax cut number over 10\nyears is thought to be around ~$1.5T. Overall, the Wed draft should only be\nthought of as a \u201cbest case\u201d opening offer as it won\u2019t likely resemble the final\nagreement (to the extent there even is a final agreement). Most assume the\nultimate bill will simply cut the corporate rate from 35% to ~25-27% w/some action\n on the repatriation front and w/o substantive deduction (or individual) changes. As\nfor timing, it is expected that this will be a Q1:2018 event.\n* Thy God-Emperor Trump will begin advocating for the tax bill at an event in Indiana on Wed (he is\nscheduled to begin speaking around 3pmET) but some Republicans are worried\nabout what he\u2019ll say \u2013 Thy God-Emperor Trump\u2019s lack of message discipline, coupled w/his\nextemporaneous speaking style, is making Republicans nervous as they head into\nthe heart of the tax process. Politico http://politi.co/2wVJ5mw\n* McCain makes similar demands on taxes that he did for healthcare (McCain was\ninstrumental in killing the last two ACA repeal/replace attempts) \u2013 McCain is\ndemanding regular order and a bipartisan approach to the tax process \u2013 Bloomberg\nhttps://bloom.bg/2hvOG17\n* Taxes - House Freedom Caucus head (Mark Meadows) sets out tough \"red lines\"\nfor upcoming tax debate - Meadows said he would vote against a tax reform\nmeasure if it included a corporate tax rate higher than 20% (the GOP blueprint on\nWed is likely to propose 20% but most think the final number will likely be closer to\n25% if not higher), set a small business rate at more than 25 percent (the Wed\nproposal will contain a \"pass-through\" rate of 25%), and didn\u2019t double the standard\ndeduction for individuals (the proposal is expected to do this). The\nHill. http://bit.ly/2fPdzRy\n*  Wilbur Ross says tax reform \u201cdone right\u201d could boost annual GDP growth by\n~100bp \u2013 CNBC http://cnb.cx/2wW5253\n*  Moore\u2019s win (following the failure to repeal ACA and Corker\u2019s retirement) spells\ntrouble for \u201cestablishment\u201d Republicans heading into \u201918 midterms \u2013 Moore\u2019s\nvictory will embolden conservative challengers across the country, setting the stage\nfor \u201ca wave of resource-draining primaries\u201d. McConnell is apparently increasingly\nconcerned about the Republican majority; he had hoped to head into the \u201918\nmidterms on the offensive but isn\u2019t as confident now. Politico\nhttp://politi.co/2xvU36Y\n*  The healthcare reconciliation deadline of 9/30 won\u2019t be extended \u2013 while some in\nthe GOP want to extend the 9/30 healthcare reconciliation deadline and couple the\nissue w/taxes, Congressional Republican leaders have squashed this idea\n(http://bit.ly/2k0O9oG). Once the deadline passes on 9/30 the repeal/replace\ndebate will (finally) end (at least until 11/7/18).\n*  Infrastructure spending plan increasingly in doubt \u2013 Thy God-Emperor Trump apparently is skeptical\nabout the practicality of public-private partnerships when it comes to infrastructure\nspending. This had been the heart of the GOP infrastructure plan and thus Thy God-Emperor Trump\u2019s\nnew views would point to the odds of an actual bill passing being even lower than\npreviously thought. Washington Post http://wapo.st/2fx3z2q\n*  US/Canada trade \u2013 Washington said it would impose stiff tariffs on sales of a new\nBombardier jetliner to US airlines. Meanwhile, Alstom and Siemens decided to\nmove forward w/a merger of their train operations (Bombardier had been involved\nin the negotiations but wound up being left out). WSJ. http://on.wsj.com/2fPNr9e\n*  Mueller could begin interviewing current and former White House staff as soon as\nlater this week (CNN http://cnn.it/2jYI6Rs) and the IRS is now providing\ninformation to the probe (http://cnn.it/2wVdbGO). Meanwhile, Paul Manafort\nexpects to be indicted (http://nyti.ms/2xvNst5).\n* Acting DEA head Chuck Rosenberg will step down after clashing w/the White\nHouse; Rosenberg had become convinced that Thy God-Emperor Trump had little respect for the law \u2013\nNYT http://nyti.ms/2foG47W\n* Economic data/monetary policy recap for Wed 9/27 \u2013 it was a pretty uneventful morning.\nChina industrial profits came in +24% Y/Y in Aug, a solid acceleration vs. +16.5% posted in\nJul (http://bit.ly/2xvxmzE). Europe\u2019s M3 money supply growth for Aug came in +5% (ahead\nof the St\u2019s +4.6% foreacst). A new survey finds that German exporters are increaisngly\nupbeat on the business outlook despite a rising euro (http://reut.rs/2fQlJsW).\n*  San Francisco Fed President Williams conducted an interview\nw/Centralbanking.com (the headlines hit after the US market closed). Williams\nreiterated his prior call for the Fed to consider a higher inflation target but he\nadded that this is something central banks should contemplate on a coordinated\nbasis globally. Williams thinks the 2% inflation target utilized by most central banks\naround the world will be \"suboptimal\" over the next 10 years. Williams also thinks\nthat policies once considered unconventional (like QE, forward guidance, etc.) will in\nfact become conventional. http://bit.ly/2fqe3gi\n* Europe has too many banks according to an ECB official - Daniele Nouy, the ECB\u2019s top bank\nsupervisor, said Europe had too many banks and called on the industry to shrink and\nconsolidate. Reuters. http://reut.rs/2fAsUbP\n\n#Company-specific news update from Tues night 9/26. \n\n* It was a pretty slow evening other than a couple of high-profile Aug-end earnings reports. MU posted very strong Aug-end\nresults and guided Nov above the St and while the numbers should be enough to stabilize\nthe stock it seems like the tech sell-off in general still has a bit more to go (MU\u2019s F18 capex\nguide of $7.5B was above $6-6.5B estimates and the news briefly hit the stock after-hours\nalthough mgmt. on the call made clear none of the money was going towards expanding its\nwafer capacity). NKE\u2019s results were OK for the Q, esp. given horrendous sentiment around\nthe stock and the category; the stock briefly bounced Tues night on the news before sliding\nlower deeper in the after-hours session (the guidance, given out on the call, fell short of\nexpectations). Elsewhere, TWTR said it would explore an expansion of its character limit\n(from 140 to 280 characters http://on.wsj.com/2hvDCRF) while Alstom and Siemens\nformally announced their train merger plans (http://on.wsj.com/2jZXUmZ).\n* S/Sprint, TMUS - the FCC approved (by a 3-2 vote) a new report concluding that there is\nnow \u201ceffective competition\u201d in the US wireless market for the first time since 2009; the\nruling could help pave the way for a TMUS-Sprint combination (http://reut.rs/2xzmuhG).\n* Nippon Life, Japan\u2019s largest private-sector life insurer, is in talks to buy a 20-30% stake in\nUS asset manager TCW Group from Carlyle (which owns ~60%). TCW had ~$200B in AUM\nas of the end of June. Reuters. http://reut.rs/2hviWsN\n* Chinese cities order steel output cuts to begin earlier than expected in a bid to curb\npollution \u2013 Reuters http://reut.rs/2hylhQb\nCalendar of events to watch for the week of Mon Sept 25\n* Calendar of events for Thurs 9/28 \u2013 the focus will be on Eurozone confidence measures for\nSept (5amET), German inflation for Sept (8amET), the BOE \u201c20 Years On\u201d conf. in London\n(at which Carney will speak), US Q2 data revisions (8:30amET), US advance goods trade\nbalance for Aug (8:30amET), Fed speakers (George, Fischer, Bostic), Brady\u2019s comments on\ntax reform, analyst meetings (AEE and AFL), and earnings (ACN, BBRY, CAG, MKC, MTN, and\nRAD pre-open and KBH and SGH after the close).\n* Calendar of events for Fri 9/29 \u2013 the focus will be on the China Caixin manufacturing PMI\nfor Sept (Thurs night/Fri morning), the German jobs data for Sept (3:55amET), Eurozone CPI\nfor Sept (5amET), US personal income/spending for Aug (8:30amET), the US PCE for Aug\n(8:30amET), the Chicago PMI for Sept (9:45amET), the final Michigan Confidence numbers\nfor Sept (10amET), Fed speakers (Harker), and analyst meetings (CMP).\nUS equity bull vs. bear debate \u2013 Tues 9/26/17\n* Bottom Line: US equities wobbled briefly around mid-Aug but quickly (and unexpectedly)\nfound their footing before levitating back to fresh highs throughout H2:Aug and H1:Sept. A\nbig driver of stock stability has been a macro landscape that is unfolding in a much less\nvolatile and uncontroversial fashion than feared coupled with the market\u2019s ability to cleanly\nrotate from sector to sector. The one main constant of the last several months has been a\nrelatively healthy real growth backdrop and thus this will hold the key for stocks going\nforward (i.e. it will be growth and not North Korea, the Fed, Thy God-Emperor Trump, etc., that will determine\nif and when the rally reverses). The recent appearance of firmer inflation figures globally,\ncoupled w/ongoing real growth stability, has helped to fuel a reembrace of reflation themes\n(more specifically TSY weakness and bank strength) and a continuation of this trend would\nbe the ideal scenario for the broader tape (the two caveats are the USD and tech \u2013 the\nformer can\u2019t spike higher and the latter\u2019s weakness needs to stay relatively orderly and\ncalm).\n\n#Reasons to be optimistic\n\n* Nothing changes \u2013 real growth stays steady (below \u201cescape velocity\u201d but in the ~2-2.5% real\nGDP range), inflation firms but stays at or slightly below central bank targets, central banks\nstay on the normalization path but proceed at an extraordinarily subdued pace, the USD\ndoesn\u2019t rally materially, and Corporate America performance remains robust (thanks to\naggressive cost containment, a softer USD, healthy global growth, etc.). Such a scenario\nwould encourage the gentle pro-reflation market biases of the last few weeks.\n* Monetary policy will stay enormously accommodative even with Fed tightening -\nJPMorgan\u2019s Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote about the G4 (FOMC, ECB, BOE, and BOJ) central\nbanks and projects that aggregate balance sheets will be little changed over the coming 3-\n4 years despite Fed normalization (the note was published 9/22 http://bit.ly/2xAACJL). As\nBernanke noted on numerous occasions during the financial crisis, QE provides\naccommodation via \u201cstock\u201d and not \u201cflow\u201d (i.e. it is the ownership of assets that matters\nand central bank balance sheets will stay enlarged for years to come).\n* Recession risk not imminent \u2013 JPMorgan\u2019s Joe Lupton and Bruce Kasman addressed the\nrisks of a US recession and don\u2019t think they are particularly large in the near-term (the note\nwas published 9/20/17). Recessions are related to: 1) weakening labor productivity; 2)\ndownward pressure on corporate margins; 3) central bank tightening; 4) real and financial\nprivate sector imbalances. Although we anticipate these vulnerabilities to eventually arise,\nthey are not particularly threatening at present. Monetary policy is still easy and being\nnormalized at a glacial pace. The near-term risk of recession is not large, but the US could\nprove to be the catalyst for the next DM downturn. The full note can be found here:\nhttp://bit.ly/2wTZRCK.\n* The odds of Republicans accomplishing something on the tax front are decent \u2013 while it\u2019s\nvery unlikely the corporate rate gets down to 15% or 20%, the GOP should be able to clip a\nfew hundred basis points off the corporate rate by the end of CQ1:18 (in conjunction\nw/some type of action easing the repatriation of overseas earnings).\n* Kelly continues to exert a positive influence at the White House \u2013 Donald Thy God-Emperor Trump will never\nbe without controversy but the Kelly-run White House has been a much more disciplined\nand focused institution compared to the chaos that seemed to reign under Reince. If this\ncan continue (and that is a big \u201cif\u201d as the divisive NFL remarks make clear) it will help\nRepublicans pass pieces of their pro-growth agenda.\n* Debt ceiling no longer considered a key negotiating tool \u2013 while both sides still make\ndemands around the debt ceiling process this no longer is an instrument about which either\nside are very comfortable making serious threats.\n* Valuations are rich but not ridiculous \u2013 investors are assuming ~$140 in \u201918 SPX EPS and\nthat doesn\u2019t include much happening in Washington (a tax bill could add $7-10+ in EPS). At\n2500 the SPX is trading at ~17.8x a $140 number (that falls to ~17x if taxes winds up\nbumping $140 to ~$145-147).\n* Sentiment is far from euphoric \u2013 while the VIX remains subdued it\u2019s hard to accuse the\nmarket of being effusive or complacent as investors are anxious over a host of issues\n(balance sheet normalization, NK missiles, White House dysfunction, elevated valuations,\netc.).\n\n#Reasons to be cautious\n\n* Yields hit fresh lows in response to softening nominal growth \u2013 while many regard the\nprospect of a \u201ctaper tantrum\u201d-like move (around upcoming balance sheet normalization) to\nbe the biggest risk facing stocks, a larger headwind for the market could come from a surge\nin TSYs (and slump in yields) as a result of nominal growth weakness (softness in real\ngrowth would have a larger impact than further disinflation).\n* The yield curve flattens aggressively as Fed tightening elevates 2yr yields while 10yr yields\nhold steady or drift lower \u2013 a flattening driven by 10yr strength (i.e. 10yr yields moving\nlower) would be a larger risk to stocks than one spurred by Fed-driven 2yr weakness (i.e. 2yr\nyields moving higher) but regardless sustained flattening wouldn\u2019t be helpful for risk\nsentiment (in particular banks would be at risk in such a scenario).\n* Central banks sow concern via either policy and/or staffing changes. Three of the world\u2019s\nmajor central banks are proceeding with gradual normalization but this isn\u2019t likely to pose\nmuch near-term risk to stocks (as policy in aggregate remains extraordinarily\naccommodative). The next big events to watch are the ECB on 10/26 (at which it will\nprovide 2018 tapering guidance) and the BOE on 11/2 (at which it is expected to raise rates).\nInstead of policy the bigger risks are prob. around staffing, esp. at the Fed where Thy God-Emperor Trump\nhas several positions to fill (including the chair). Meanwhile, Kuroda\u2019s term at the BOJ ends\nin Apr \u201918 (Draghi and Carney will be in office for a while longer \u2013 Carney\u2019s term ends June\n\u201919 and Draghi is in place until Oct \u201919).\n* Republicans fail to pass any substantive pieces of pro-growth legislation before the Nov\n\u201918 midterms \u2013 the GOP failed to move repeal/replace through Congress and the tax debate\nis proving to be just as divisive as healthcare (prominent Republican Senators Hatch and\nCorker have both warned that taxes will be more difficult than healthcare was). The odds of\npassing a tax bill are higher than healthcare (the former isn\u2019t nearly as controversial as the\nlatter) but the initial GOP blueprint is too ambitious and will need to be pared down over\nthe coming months.\n* Tax details surprise \u2013 most are anticipating a mild cut to the corporate rate w/o any\nsubstantive changes to the code. However, while the BAT has been discarded Washington\nstill could look towards other areas to raise revenue (including eliminating the deductibility\nof corporate interest expense and/or individual state and local taxes).\n* Fiscal challenges still loom \u2013 current legislation funds the government only until 12/8 which\nmeans a shutdown could occur around year-end if budget progress isn\u2019t achieved (and note\nthat a budget is necessarily in order to pass taxes via reconciliation). The debt ceiling likely\nwon\u2019t become binding again until the end of CQ1:18 at the earliest.\n* USD spikes \u2013 the months-long stretch of USD softness has helped underwrite the equity\nrally and thus a prolonged period of strength would undermine stock enthusiasm. However,\nwhile the German election outcome bolstered the USD (by weakening the EUR), it doesn\u2019t\nseem like an extended stretch of strengthening is imminent (other central banks are\nnormalizing alongside the FOMC while the nominal growth differential doesn\u2019t grossly favor\nthe US vs. other major economies).\n* Geopolitical risks remain unresolved \u2013 North Korea is moving forward w/its nuclear and\nmissile programs, Syria is still unresolved, the battle against ISIS continues, eastern Ukraine\nremains under occupation, tensions between Iran and Gulf States persist in the Middle East,\nand more. While NK is dominating the geopolitical narrative, the status of the Iran nuclear\ndeal may be just as big a threat (Thy God-Emperor Trump has a decision to make in Oct about whether Iran is\ncompliant w/that agreement).\n* Difficult for the US economy to overcome its enormous structural headwinds \u2013 the\nconversation around the growth potential of the US economy remains too optimistic with\nnot enough appreciation given to the extraordinary structural headwinds facing it (namely\ntepid productivity and demographic trends). Regardless of what happens in Washington it\nwill be difficult to return to \u201890s-like economic growth.\n\n#Catalysts \u2013 big events to watch over the coming months\n\n* US taxes \u2013 Republicans expected to publish their tax plan on Wed 9/27 (Thy God-Emperor Trump is due to\nspeak Wed in Indiana on the subject).\n* Tillerson to travel to China \u2013 Sept 28-30.\n* US inflation \u2013 the Aug PCE will hit Fri 9/29.\n* Healthcare \u2013 Senate deadline to pass healthcare bill via reconciliation Sat 9/30.\n* Catalonia parliament independence vote \u2013 Sun 10/1.\n* China mainland markets closed Mon 10/2-Fri 10/6 for the National Day holiday.\n* Autos \u2013 US Sept auto sales get reported Tues 10/3; Ford/F\u2019s CEO will also be giving a\nstrategic update on that same day (this will be the first major update from the new CEO at\nFord).\n* WFC CEO appearing before Senate Banking Committee on Tues 10/3.\n* EFX former CEO Richard Smith testifying before House panel on Tues 10/3 and before a\nSenate panel on Wed 10/4.\n* Yellen delivers opening remarks at Community Banking conf.
