{"title": "Harmonic Trading | AMD | Intel | Apple |", "selftext": "Hey fags, you probably didn't listen to me earlier when i had posted about AMD forming a bullish bat. That thread is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6a54zw/bullish_bat_harmonic_pattern_formed_in_amd_cmp/). The chart is [here](https://in.tradingview.com/x/3MppI09S/).\n\nAs we can see AMD has moved from recommended price of 10.04 to 11.26, representing a  12.1% return. The may 19th 11 CE option has appreciated more than 100% and if you were using leverage, you would have earned 100% as well. \n\nIn my opinion there is still a lot of juice left in the up move, resistance will be stiff at the 11.71 mark which is the gap-down red candle high witnessed a few days ago on significant volume. Once that high has been breached we can see 13.5 soon in no time. However we could see a breakdown if significant volume is not witnessed soon. \n\nI feel so fucking bad for all the autism-ridden trades i see in this sub, i couldn't bare it anymore, so here are 2 more. If you want analysis on any other companies let me know. I don't usually trade American scrips but hey, as i said, i feel bad for the retards every now and then. \n\n\n**We are seeing some interesting formations in [Intel]\n(https://in.tradingview.com/x/sD69gpSm/) and [Apple](https://in.tradingview.com/x/C3VRvcGd/) as well.** \n\n\n**[Intel](https://in.tradingview.com/x/sD69gpSm/)**\n\nIn this chart we are seeing signs of reversals with another harmonic bat pattern. Traders can enter at the CMP of 35.53 for a T1 of 36.11 and a T2 of 36.52. Riskier traders can stay invested for a target of 37+ booking partial profit along the way according to risk appetite. Stop loss here would be 35.18.\n\nOur volume is characteristic of the bat, tapering off towards the end, with a sudden spike in upward volume. RSI has also entered 20 territory, which is again a comfortable thing to see in a reversal. Breaching of the 35.91 mark is crucial for us here as it represents the B point, a significant inflection point. \n\n  \n\n\n**[Apple](https://in.tradingview.com/x/C3VRvcGd/)**\n\nFor apple we are seeing a bearish crab forming. Crabs are volatile patterns and the pattern completion at the D point usually comes swiftly at the end. 161 is our entrance point, but note due to the volatility of the pattern we can keep the stop loss around 165. Risk averse traders can keep it 164. T1 in this instance is 138 and T2 is 125. Risk averse traders can book between T1 and T2. \n\nReinforcements to the short call are given by the RSI which is in a comfortable 80+ zone in the weekly and the diverging reduction in volume on the uptrend. Both these lend conviction to an unsustainable upward move. \n\nWe must be cautious here however since the upward leg of the pattern is happening rather fast. Watch for gap-up type movement near the D point, this would invalidate the pattern. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "6b3vzj", "created_utc": 1494768545.0, "score": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "This user account is one of the most sophisticated troll bots ever made", "score": 62, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10446061193943024}, {"body": "Fucking chart fag", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "I was about to say, and the only thing about that whole post that I was going to say, was:\n\nSo you're a chart guy eh?\n\nEvery moron in this bull market can make money...should make money, but \"have you ever seen the rain...\"", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "That's why there's a short recco in there right?

{"title": "Harmonic Trading | AMD | Intel | Apple |", "selftext": "Hey fags, you probably didn't listen to me earlier when i had posted about AMD forming a bullish bat. That thread is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/6a54zw/bullish_bat_harmonic_pattern_formed_in_amd_cmp/). The chart is [here](https://in.tradingview.com/x/3MppI09S/).\n\nAs we can see AMD has moved from recommended price of 10.04 to 11.26, representing a  12.1% return. The may 19th 11 CE option has appreciated more than 100% and if you were using leverage, you would have earned 100% as well. \n\nIn my opinion there is still a lot of juice left in the up move, resistance will be stiff at the 11.71 mark which is the gap-down red candle high witnessed a few days ago on significant volume. Once that high has been breached we can see 13.5 soon in no time. However we could see a breakdown if significant volume is not witnessed soon. \n\nI feel so fucking bad for all the autism-ridden trades i see in this sub, i couldn't bare it anymore, so here are 2 more. If you want analysis on any other companies let me know. I don't usually trade American scrips but hey, as i said, i feel bad for the retards every now and then. \n\n\n**We are seeing some interesting formations in [Intel]\n(https://in.tradingview.com/x/sD69gpSm/) and [Apple](https://in.tradingview.com/x/C3VRvcGd/) as well.** \n\n\n**[Intel](https://in.tradingview.com/x/sD69gpSm/)**\n\nIn this chart we are seeing signs of reversals with another harmonic bat pattern. Traders can enter at the CMP of 35.53 for a T1 of 36.11 and a T2 of 36.52. Riskier traders can stay invested for a target of 37+ booking partial profit along the way according to risk appetite. Stop loss here would be 35.18.\n\nOur volume is characteristic of the bat, tapering off towards the end, with a sudden spike in upward volume. RSI has also entered 20 territory, which is again a comfortable thing to see in a reversal. Breaching of the 35.91 mark is crucial for us here as it represents the B point, a significant inflection point. \n\n  \n\n\n**[Apple](https://in.tradingview.com/x/C3VRvcGd/)**\n\nFor apple we are seeing a bearish crab forming. Crabs are volatile patterns and the pattern completion at the D point usually comes swiftly at the end. 161 is our entrance point, but note due to the volatility of the pattern we can keep the stop loss around 165. Risk averse traders can keep it 164. T1 in this instance is 138 and T2 is 125. Risk averse traders can book between T1 and T2. \n\nReinforcements to the short call are given by the RSI which is in a comfortable 80+ zone in the weekly and the diverging reduction in volume on the uptrend. Both these lend conviction to an unsustainable upward move. \n\nWe must be cautious here however since the upward leg of the pattern is happening rather fast. Watch for gap-up type movement near the D point, this would invalidate the pattern. \n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "6b3vzj", "created_utc": 1494768545.0, "score": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "This user account is one of the most sophisticated troll bots ever made", "score": 62, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10446061193943024}, {"body": "Fucking chart fag", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "I was about to say, and the only thing about that whole post that I was going to say, was:\n\nSo you're a chart guy eh?\n\nEvery moron in this bull market can make money...should make money, but \"have you ever seen the rain...\"", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "That's why there's a short recco in there right?
