Also TSLA is a mover so even if I said \"let me profit off some of that implied volatility\" and tried to sell options, I don't think I could make anything that would justify the potential risk because the damn thing could gap like a monster.

We could get philosophical here though and say that ultimately maybe no earnings report matters, what matters is how the market reacts to it and unless you have a strategy that can reliably predict that, you're guessing/gambling. Nothing wrong with that either as long as you realize it's a gamble and size/hedge/manage risk accordingly. If I value my prize cow at $2,000 today and say \"It's only going to get bigger, fatter, and more valuable as time goes on! Buy it today for $5,000!\" and people generally agree and agree to buy it for $5,000. Great. Except I didn't lock the gate to its pen and as I was hyping it up and selling it, the cow decided to get into a headbutting match with a tractor trailer. \n\nWe go to the pen, my investors and I, and lo and behold it's gone. We go to the nearby highway and the only quantity of 5,000 left, are the 5,000 pieces the cow is laying in. Of course, even then, there's still probably going to be someone in that crowd that says \"but wait a second...what if we put the cow back together?\" The opposite can happen as well and there can be unexpected positive factors. The point is, that I personally can't see the future and I'll freely admit that. 10 years from now, 20 years from now, whatever. A nuke could hit us tomorrow and suddenly the 10 year plan changes. I have to go on what I have here right now and what I have behind me that is as similar as I can find to what's ahead. You ask \"what good is the earnings report today?\" and my answer to that in short is \"who knows\", I'll wait and see what the market thinks and go from there. \n\nEdit: Also I should note that I'm generally operating on mid-duration time horizons so if you're asking your question from a buy and hold/long term perspective the answer is probably closer to: the earnings report serves only to either provide you with a favorable opportunity to increase your position size in a company you believe will stand the test of time and outperform alternative investments over the time line of your holding period OR it will serve to generate higher demand and propel your current holdings ever higher. If you're asking from the perspective of someone doing an earnings play, maybe you have a system/strategy that is reliable and you've done your homework to conclude that you actually have an edge there.
