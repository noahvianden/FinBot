I spoke to some of these spammers and less than 1% wanted to comply (text post, no links/website mentions).  These types of posts still come in by regular users (not spammers, botters, or self promoters) and that's great, but it's so much less.\n\nSo where does that leave us?  Well, you're here to discuss stocks, right?  And that's pretty much the major post type now.\n\nHowever it would be great if the community came in to share their experience/knowledge or post gains (or losses) and explain what happened; I know we do in comments and that's great, but reddit runs on daily threads, so if you're reading this, consider submitting a post on how you got gains (like weekly because if it's not good, it'll look like spam).  And I don't mean I-told-you-so posts because I've already banned 1 user for spamming r/stocks with \"warning sell ___ stock now or else\" and then the next day \"I told you so\" that's shit & spam; anyone can say anything in hindsight, but if you have knowledge & gains to back it up, then that's meaningful & a quality post.\n\nI would love to read a post by someone who used stochastic & another indicator and made profit that day (or any indicator/concept), or even a loss & learned-a-lesson story.\n\nUnfortunately I know many traders that just end up selling their experience/knowledge, and that's where all the spam comes from.
