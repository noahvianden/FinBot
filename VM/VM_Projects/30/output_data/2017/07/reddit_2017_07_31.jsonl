It's so good that the prices of shares 6 months ago really did seem like a bargain. Has the market rallied under Trump? Yes, it's been a great year thus far but it a lot of it comes on an empty promise (the dude can't math or write a bill to save his life).

The stock gets punished because their growth came at a steep operating cost this quarter. You'll see a return if you plan to hold medium to long term.
