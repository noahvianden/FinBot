I've been a coder for a long time but only recently moved to options, so my perspective is more from the technology side.\n\nIts just, the coding process here (start at the midpoint and walk towards the ask) is so very simple to implement. I built one early on because I hated doing that \"change the price every few seconds\" process. Mostly I was trading 10-lot credit spreads. I noticed that I tended to get filled from the \"walking\" around a quarter of the way between the midpoint and the ask. But I saw almost the same pattern if I just entered a limit order at the ask, so there seemed no need to bother. I kinda assumed my broker did something like that behind the scenes even if I didn't (it was that similar), but maybe not.\n\nYMMV of course, and I only traded a few hundred contracts while I was directly comparing the two, and they could be conflicting with each other from a price discovery standpoint (though I never filled from the same underlying), so by no means is that definitive. But the coder/business guy in me thinks that if a \"walk limit\" order was noticeably better at getting fills, and is so easy to implement, then every retail brokerage would be doing so.
