Selling a cash-secured put is a good way to acquire stock at a discount. Of course it has its risks (like any investing), but it\u2019s not a bad approach. It\u2019s also not generally a strategy you use to acquire stock as much as it is a neutral/bullish strategy you put in place to generate income with the understanding that you may end up acquiring the stock at your strike. In other words, you might expect to sell 5% OTM monthly puts for 3-4 months before getting assigned (this is a completely arbitrary example). Or the stock may regularly rise and you\u2019ll only gain from your premiums without ever acquiring the stock.\n\nIf you\u2019d be open to getting assigned on the puts, then I\u2019d suggest thinking of it as a \u201ccash-secured\u201d put as opposed to a \u201cnaked\u201d put. The only difference is margin: cash-secured puts can be sold at any option level, as long as they have the cash to support assignment. Naked, on the other hand, follow a different margin requirement (top options level) that allows you to leverage up significantly and get really hurt if you bet wrong. The whole point here is that you shouldn\u2019t put up more margin that you want to own. It might seem obvious, but if you want to own 500 shares, then only sell 5 puts.\n\nBesides missing out on upside in a surge, the biggest problem with selling puts like this is that it gets more expensive to close the trade if it turns against you and you change your mind about owning the stock. Beyond the obvious delta costs of a put as the stock drops, you\u2019ll also need to deal with a rise in implied volatility since that spikes when a stock tanks.\n\nYou should also consider whether you\u2019d really want to own the stock after an X% decline. Some people look at a 100 stock today and decide to sell the 90 put because they\u2019d love to own it at a 10% discount. (This also comes up a lot with analyst and recommendation services who have a \u201cbuy below\u201d price that\u2019s well below the market price.) However, what you really need to think about is the circumstances under which the stock would drop 10% over the term of your trade. Something would have to happen to drastically change the market\u2019s view of the underlying, so wouldn\u2019t it also change your view when the time comes? But if you\u2019re looking to own the stock for years, then maybe that\u2019s acceptable for your goals.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for giving some insight into the argument for the positive side of the strategy. Yeah my main goal with selling the puts would be to generate somewhat consistent predictable income on a stock that I wouldn't mind owning 100 of anyways. The reason why my interest has been piqued on this strategy is that even in this very bullish market we are in currently, even the hottest stocks take a break and trade sideways for a few weeks to a few months, and as an active swing trader in my 20's without hundreds of thousands of dollars in capital to employ, it can really suck to start a position and just watch it trade sideways for a couple months. So I would essentially be looking to trade the potential for explosive upside potential for the element of making an income even if the stock just trades sideways for a bit. \n\nMy idea with it is to always sell puts a bit below what I perceive to be a strong support level (as for my swing trading I trade almost purely off technicals) and then probably treat it like I'd treat any normal swing trade I make, if it breaks below the support just accept that I was wrong on the trade and close the position for a minor loss.
