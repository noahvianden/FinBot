I'd guess the vast majority of Tesla shareholders aren't in it for the infinite P/E ratio or the negative profit, but rather the possibility of an annoucement/strong quarter pushing the price up in a short period of time. \n\nIf you think about it considering the risk in a Tesla type company, holding options makes quite a bit of sense. A shareholder and a call holder both are really looking for the exact same thing. Its not like some insurance/bank stocks which are actively making money and paying dividends. \n\nTo me, selling options kinda makes sense though, because in the worst case scenario you lock in some profit (strike-share price + premium) and Tesla's volatility/speculative nature means that the premiums may actually be slightly more than they \"should\" be. Many of the Tesla people who I talk to IRL are so bullish they are leveraged by either options or margin, so based on that alone I'd imagine the other side of the coin may not be as efficient as the rest of the market. Best case scenario they expire worthless and you keep the premium which basically lowers ACB.\n\nSo I wouldn't say its without risk, as you won't participate in the gap ups Tesla bulls are dreaming of, but in a way you are reducing risk by lowering ACB or cashing in on a profit. If you are truly bullish though sell them at a level where you don't mind being put out of the position. That could happen sooner or later.
