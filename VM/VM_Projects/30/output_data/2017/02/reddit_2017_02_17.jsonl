I'm not looking to exercise the options.\n\n\n**EDIT: Throwing a specific question in here:**\n\nToday: AAPL underlying price is $135.

Assume no significant news has come out.\n\n**Is there way to predict, approximately, what the price of the contract would be now?

This tends to be about 25% of the time, so be prepared to lose a lot. Hopefully the 1/4 winners will make up for all the losing, but for most novices, it doesn't happen that way and they end up in the red with straight call buying.\n\nI suggest novices trade at the money to keep things simple. At the money options tend to have a delta of .5, so a 1 point immediate move in the underlying translates into 50 cents on the atm option (both up and down). This is for small moves, for big moves, it changes.\n\nTo get an idea of what the decay is like, look at the shorter term options, or an options simulator. For example, if a person is buying a 3-week option, look at the 2-week at the same strike and that will estimate the decay for the coming week. There are exceptions if there are big news events such as earnings and/or significant dividends, so check the event calendar.\n\nAdvice? I always advise folks to have a plan for every trade, and to keep a trading journal. Keep in mind that it's been a rip roaring bull market the last few weeks. Best bull move in 25 years, by some measurements. Buying calls tends to make sense and profits, during strong bull moves. So, again, be prepared for a lot of losing if and when the bull starts to cool off.\n\nWhile 2 to 3 week options tend to cost less per contract, they cost a lot in terms of decay per day.
