{"title": "VIX for hedge, good or bad idea?", "selftext": "I have seen recommendations to use VIX (or its derivatives such as VXX) as a hedge against long positions. Looking at VIX's historical data, I realized that:\n\n1) Scenario 1: from February 2, 2018 to February 6, 2018, VIX jump from 12 to 50. During the same period, SPY dropped around 10%.\n\n2) Scenario 2: from October 3, 2018 to October 11, 2018, VIX jumps from 12 to 28 and hangs around 22 until December 17, 2018 when it increases to 36 in a matter of a week and quickly goes back to 22 in the next few days. During the same period, SPY has a maximum drop of 20%.\n\nBacktesting on VXX (pretty much consistent with VIX) shows that having a long position in VXX would be very profitable in the first scenario however, in the second scenario even though VXX goes up slightly, it is nowhere close to compensating for the loss in the long positions. The reason is that VIX jumps high so hard back in February of 2018 but its increase in winter is very gradual and minimal. Having said that, I have two questions:\n\n1) Why do you think VIX jumped very quickly in February 2018 while its move was smooth in December 2018? Can we say market was surprised in Februrary but it was kind of prepared for a drop in December? or market did not believe that SPY would in December?\n\n2) Have you used VIX as a successful hedge? If so, please provide examples on when VIX long position paid off and when it failed to return on investment.", "id": "e0mt8z", "created_utc": 1574537713.0, "score": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "A few things...\n\n- First of all, you may know it but it isn't clear from your post, VIX is an index and you can't hold it, long or short. You can only hold derivatives on the VIX, such as VIX Options, VIX Futures, ETPs based on the VIX such as VXX that you mention, etc.\n\nHolding any of those derivatives (or ETPs built based on them) will not be equivalent to \"holding VIX\". It's just impossible to properly replicate.\n\nThe main reason why it's impossible to properly replicate pure exposure to the VIX is due to the fundamental nature of the VIX and how humans perceive and deal with uncertainty/fear.\n\n- Then, there's the fact that due to how VXX is constructed, *it will go down a lot over time*.\n\nVXX is built by holding VIX futures in the front month and the next in a proportion that is equivalent to 30 days. So you're basically long something like a synthetic 30-day VIX.\n\nDue to the very nature of volatility, VIX futures are nearly all the time in very strong contango. Because of that, and because the VIX will typically spend incredibly long periods in very small ranges (much smaller than the basis of the futures!), the trade will inherently lose money over time, with occasional very quick spikes quickly followed by quick drops.\n\nOver time, it's a loser. Just look at a \"total return\" chart of the 30-day VIX index, or simply VXX.\n\nThe same thing is true for any other attempt to construct long exposure to the VIX. Buying futures, buying calls, buying call spreads, selling puts, selling put spreads, buying synthetic longs, etc, all will generate losses and more losses over time. The occasional spikes won't pay you back.\n\nAs a side note, a lot of funds and traders have been playing a short volatility trade for years: it would be doing exactly the opposite of the above, i.e., establishing some sort of short position on the VIX. It worked great for many years, as all those losses from the longs were profits for the shorts. But eventually when the VIX spikes, the shorts that possibly got over-leveraged thinking they found the holy grail had their accounts blow up. E.g., see what happened to XIV on that day in Feb/2018.\n\n\n- Then, while it is generally the case that a sharp drop on SP500 coincides with a spike on the VIX, it's incredibly difficult to anticipate *when* those sharp drops on the SP500 will happen.\n\nIf you knew when the sharp drop would happen, you could just hedge your portfolio by shorting SPY, /ES, or buying Puts on any of that for example. You would establish the hedge right before the sharp drop, and close it right after. Not a reliable strategy, though, as predicting it that precisely isn't feasible.\n\nIn the event of an actual sharp drop on the SP500, it's also incredibly difficult to anticipate *how far* the VIX will move. Which means *it's really hard to determine what a good hedging ratio would be*, even if you could anticipate when the sharp SP500 drop would happen.\n\nHolding the hedge longer term could help with not being able to anticipate when the sharp drops happen. However, it doesn't work either.\n\nLike I mentioned on the previous bullet point, trades that try to simulate holding the VIX long will suffer with passage of time. They will in fact suffer so much that when the SP500 sharp drop happens, and the VIX spikes, the gains from the hedge will most likely not pay for the long term losses.", "score": 85, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "> My next study is happens to be long puts on SPY.

I may be wrong but my theory is that VIX  index is really what everyone says: fear factor. When market is caught by surprise, everyone freaks out and rush into buying SPX (or SPY) puts, causing VIX to jump.
