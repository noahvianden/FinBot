Unless you're literally playing a game of holding/shorting until 2021 to see actual purchase orders, there is only one true metric that is going to change the stock a large amount now that the announcement is out - pre-order numbers.\n\nTesla is going to announce a ridiculously high number of pre-orders this weekend or on Monday. The media is going to run with it as if it is actual concrete orders when in reality, it's just a $100 refundable deposit (far cheaper than any pre-order deposit for a Tesla product ever).
