To give you an idea:\n\nboeing produces about 500 737's a year. They have 5,000 outstanding unfilled orders for 737's. So based on that, if you ordered a 737 today, you'd be lucky if you got your plane in a decade. The ratio is almost identical for airbus, at about 200 a year with a 2,000 long backlog.\n\nSo if it currently takes 10 years from order to delivery, don't you think the companies would increase production quickly if they were able?\n\nJudging by the graph here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_737#Orders_and_deliveries\n\nBoeing seems able to scale their production by about 20 planes a year. Assuming airbus would be able to scale similarly, it would take them nearly a decade to reach boeing's production numbers in this family of jets.\n\nSo whether you believe it or not, it simply takes a massive investment to scale the production of airplanes. It's not just some hangars...it's all the factories that produce all the parts along the way...and for airbus, this is far more decentralized than boeing's operation is.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": -1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.06482291221618652}], "tickers": ["ba"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Long story short with regulatory compliance and design it really does take a decade.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not sure im the person to explain how complicated it is to manufacture a plane but just trust me it's a fucking massive operation.
