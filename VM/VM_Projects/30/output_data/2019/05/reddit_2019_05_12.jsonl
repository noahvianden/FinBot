The Pentagon told the watchdog that it identified 117 aircraft -- about 40 percent of the worldwide F-35 fleet at the time -- with the same type of fuel tubes that had to be replaced. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n The disclosure was the first official information about the crash since the Pentagon program office in late October issued a status statement while the Marine Corps was still conducting its investigation. United Technologies Corp\u2019s Pratt & Whitney unit \u201cis fully responsible\u201d for \u201cthe propulsion system and has the lead in working\u201d the failure analyses, according to the statement at the time. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n A spokeswoman for the Pentagon F-35 program office deferred comment to Pratt & Whitney, whose spokesman, John Thomas, said the company had no comment. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Marine Corps spokesman Captain Chris Harrison said in a statement that the crash probe is continuing, and that the results will be released once complete. The Corps has replaced all of the relevant fuel supply tubes and \u201cwe continue to strive each and every day to ensure the safety and readiness of our aircraft,\u201d he added. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n The Sept. 28 crash of the F-35B near Beaufort, South Carolina, was the first in the two-decade old program\u2019s often-rocky history of delays, cost increases and technical glitches. Although the pilot safely ejected, the incident prompted concerns about the aircraft, which is being built by and sold to an international consortium of U.S. allies, including the U.K, Italy, Australia and Turkey. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n The Pentagon program office last year said \u201cmore than 1,500 suppliers are on the F-35 program and this is an isolated incident which is quickly being addressed and fixed. Safety is our primary goal.\u201d \n\n&#x200B;\n\n The defective part identified in the report provides operating pressure to the engine and fuel to the engine combustor. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Aside from the defect, Pratt & Whitney\u2019s recent track record delivering engines on time has been spotty. Deliveries surged to 81 in 2018 from 48 in 2012, according to the GOA-- yet 86% of those were delivered late, up from 48% in late 2017. The delays were due in part to an increase in the \u201caverage number of quality issues per engine\u201d -- 941 in 2018 against 777 a year earlier, the GAO said. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n Pratt & Whitney told the GAO that \u201cits late engine deliveries increased in 2018 partially due to a subcontractor that did not have all of the needed tooling in place to produce more F-35B engines,\u201d according to the report. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n \n\nThe F-35 is the Pentagon\u2019s most expensive weapons program, at a projected cost of more than $428 billion. More recently, a Japanese F-35A crashed off Japans coast in April, with only portions of the jet\u2019s wreckage found since then despite a monthlong search.
