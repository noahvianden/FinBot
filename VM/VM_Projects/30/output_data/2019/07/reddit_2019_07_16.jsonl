The truth is that glib judgments based on general market trends, personal experiences, or even a couple of metrics are not going to give you an edge when it comes to investing. \n\nWant to become a better investor? Become an expert in their individual markets. Find out what competitive advantage makes each company successful. Then, find out if those advantages will continue to provide growth, or if competition has made the advantage non-unique. \n\nThen, keep all of that in your brain and start looking deep into the quarterly reports. Are the profit margins getting better? Are managers making decisions that are just keeping the company afloat, or are they making decisions that will make the company grow further, and in a profitable way. \n\nFinally, after all that research, can you see any of those stocks tripling in the next 5-6 years? Do you think you\u2019re smart enough even after all your research to pick one out of 4 stocks to buy and be right? Is diversification an option, or are some of the same factors influencing all four stock prices? \n\nYou won\u2019t be a successful investor just laying some money on the table and rolling the dice. You\u2019ll be even less successful if you start drinking the company Koolaid and getting hopeful about the future based on what the company says about their own business.
