To say the least, it does not work. At all. It may be even safe to say it does more harm than good to patients of DMD - an already terminal illness. \n\nSarepta has a better solution and is the main competitor to Pfizer for DMD. They are working on genetically manipulating the root cause of DMD. Based off studies it seems that Sarepta\u2019s actually seemingly works, and the negative attention from Pfizer\u2019s mishap is enough alone to propel Sarepta\u2019s stock forward. These two are head and head and if one fails the other succeeds. With the successful study on Sarepta\u2019s side these two factors are going to ensure that the stock moves forward. This is exactly what Sarepta has been waiting for. \n\nIn the wake of this news, major investors have been dumping stock into Sarepta - which is always a good buying sign. They also have incredibly strong forecasts and \u201cbuy\u201d ratings from top analysts worldwide. \n\nFurthermore, stacked with the insight we just obtained on \u201cinsider selling,\u201d we can see that this is even more-so confirmed  based on the fact that Pfizer\u2019s team internally is massively dumping / selling their stock in anticipation of their stock dropping enormously. They know things are really bad after this study. This will add ammo to Sarepta\u2019s backing and stock price + bullish incentive. \n\nSOURCE ON INSIDER SELLS/BUYS = FINTEL.IO/Insiders\n\nI believe this is a very safe investment in Sarepta and we will expect +30% - +40% by 2020, to be conservative.", "id": "cb11ip", "created_utc": 1562679754.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "Therapeutic drugs take months, if not years, to hit the market and become profitable for a company.
