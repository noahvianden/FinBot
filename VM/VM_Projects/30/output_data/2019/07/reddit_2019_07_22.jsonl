Before with serial and parallel cables you have different cables and ports for different things; you have a plug for your mouse, a different plug for your keyboard, a different plug for a printer, and a different plug for an external storage drive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe USB port was able to standardize the ports (and potentially additional lengths of cables by allowing hundreds of devices to be plugged into 1 port) by using signal processing (software) and controllers to control multiple devices. I.E. when you plug a device into a USB port, a hardware address gets assigned and the computer can talk to a specific device by addressing the device (in software) instead of routing the signal to a unique port (in hardware).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs applied to cars, the way I understands the patent, is that now you have a controller at say the door panel, and a single cable that connects all the electronics on the door to the rest of the car. The car's central computer can then control everything from power windows, to mirrors, and speakers through that one cable because it uses software and signal processing to address them instead of using 3 separate and independent sets of cables for each of those devices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI suspect this was not done before because this is a software and computer architecture paradigm and car companies traditionally have not done software and computer hardware. The idea that you can do something like a USB for all electronic devices on a car probably never even occur to them (most people honestly).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on this paragraph in the patent.\n\n> The present disclosure relates to a wiring-system architecture and the cables and connectors necessary to implement the architecture. The overall wiring system disclosed herein approaches wiring in a different manner than traditional automotive wiring architectures. Traditional automotive wiring architectures often have many miles of cables snaking from centralized controllers and power sources to devices through the vehicle. This new architecture reduces the number and length of cables, and moves certain controllers into subassemblies which then control one or multiple devices present in the vehicle.
