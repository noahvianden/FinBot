Tesla is not only a car company. If you value different divisions seperately you get way quicker to a trillion dollar valuation than an outright car company. Cars, battery storage, autonomous driving and solar division can all grow seperatly from each other.  Because toyota is capped by only making cars, there is a much bigger limiting factor. If cars sold from tesla stagnates they can easily shift to other assets.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "> Your post makes no sense, but just wanted to point out how crazy this is in particular.\n\nYour argument is \"forgetting\" autonomy, which is an entirely new market **in addition to automotive valuation**, and which is probably going to be part of the valuation of the global automotive leader.\n\nBy 2030 we'll certainly have highly functional FSD functionality and broadly available services, ride-sharing and fleets of autonomous cars driving around and generating cash. Car makers are uniquely positioned to have a leading role in those new markets:\n\n- Here's [a study of autonomous growing into a trillions dollar per year market](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/585c3439be65942f022bbf9b/t/591a2e4be6f2e1c13df930c5/1494888038959/RethinkX+Report_051517.pdf).\n- Here's [another study that projects 7 trillion dollars by 2050](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/1/15725516/intel-7-trillion-dollar-self-driving-autonomous-cars).\n- [Waymo is already valued at around 175 billion dollars](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/alphabet-s-waymo-has-how-much-upside-14711459), and they have neither vehicle manufacturing capacity, nor a fleet of hundreds of thousands of vehicles training their networks, nor an inexpensive FSD sensor architecture that leaves out LIDAR.\n- Also, FSD is high-tech, and \"first mover advantage\" is much stronger in the high-tech industry than in the largely commoditized ICE automotive market. I.e. whoever is going to be the FSD leader will probably capture a large percentage of the profits - similarly to how Apple captured over 90% of the profits in the smartphone market, for 10 years.\n- You also forgot the much higher profit margins Tesla is working with. Valuation scales up with profit margin, and higher profit margins help the company grow faster.\n\n> That is why Tesla's stock price has only grown at an annualized compounded rate of 4.7% over the past 5 years.\n\nAh, the tried and true \"driving a car by looking into the back mirror\" $TSLAQ logic.

I see several strong reasons why Tesla's FSD advantage is strong:\n\n- Existing large fleet of hundreds of thousands of vehicles driving billions of vehicle miles, growing very fast.\n- A resulting very large and sophisticated training database for Tesla's neural networks.\n- A 'shadow mode' testing method that reports back disengagements automatically to Tesla, without having to have \"test drivers\" on the roads. Literally every customer using AutoPilot is helping train the networks.\n- A new Tesla AI chip designed from ground up by the designers of AMD's x86-64 architecture and Apple's 64-bit chip, 10x-20x faster than the current NVIDIA GPU Tesla is using.\n- An OTA update method to distribute new versions of the neural networks to the existing fleet, which allows a very fast cycle of testing and deployment.\n- A Tesla leasing program that creates a flow of 2-3 years old FSD capable vehicles returned to Tesla which can be used to build a large fleet of autonomous vehicles with very little extra capital cost, once Tesla decides to unveil the Tesla Network.\n- An aggressively vertically integrated company that owns almost every aspect of the whole product: the car and sensors, the processing hardware and the software stack.\n\n> There\u2019s many bigger and better companies to do this.\n\nThere's no other company that comes even *close* to being in the technological and market position Tesla is today. If you know of any, mention them. Size only isn't enough: Coca Cola is large and prosperous but won't suddenly be able to build an AI chip, right?\n\nIf combine those advantages with the usual \"first mover advantage\" of disruptive high-tech markets that catapulted Apple and Amazon into trillion dollar valuations it's easy to see how this could go very well.\n\nOr not.
