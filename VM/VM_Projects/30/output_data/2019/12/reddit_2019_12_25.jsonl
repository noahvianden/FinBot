No option for scheduling delivery, they are picking one. Fine with me, lets just do this.\n\nTesla plans to continue producing cars until the very last day of the year, and plans to also deliver these cars before the end of the year through a \"New Year's Eve Delivery Event at the Tesla Factory\".\n\nNormally Tesla switches to producing cars for overseas market at the very end of a quarter, because it's very difficult to produce and deliver a car in such a short period of time. However, it looks like this quarter they're pulling out all stops and trying to deliver a few thousand extra cars produced in the very final days, and even hours of the quarter.\n\nThe only question now is, do they need to jump through all these hoops to hit their guidance, or are they simply trying to crush their delivery numbers and finish the last quarter of the decade off with a bang.", "id": "efnqpw", "created_utc": 1577317807.0, "score": 72, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "I think it\u2019s an effort to get tax credit to as many people as possible.", "score": 78, "replies": [{"body": "Very good point.

I didn't see many people talking about the implications of what could have happened, but the way he wanted to structure it would have meant an absolutely absurd short squeeze, for the first time bringing the realization of \"potentially unlimited losses\" could have been.\n\nThe structure he wanted to go private with was an offer to buy out any shareholders for $420, with them not being able to get back in if they sold their shares. This created a price floor, rather than a price ceiling, meaning that no long would have ever sold for less than $420. This means every short would have had to buy back 34% of the float at a minimum of $420.\n\nSince it also would have been a last-chance-to-get-in-the-club opportunity, few believers would have, and shorts would have had a hard time finding shares to clear their obligations. The price would have immediately risen beyond $420, clearing out the majority of the order book available on the NASDAQ and locking shares up permanently. Not sure of the rate/mechanism of the margin calls, but if these were triggered automatically, the entire order book could have been cleared out very quickly, with folks obligated to buy at any price available.\n\nIt could have resulted in a squeeze well into the thousands of dollars per share, perhaps breaking into 5 figures if the margin calls happened quick enough.
