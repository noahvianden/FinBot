{"title": "Netflix is the new ACB", "selftext": "`<shitpost>`\n\nHere are all the similarities:\n\n* Look at the charts. ACB had 3 peaks, each lower than the previous, before starting its gradual decline. Netflix is currently on its third peak.\n* ACB started trying to expand to other countries to save itself due to competition in Canada. Netflix is currently facing competition in the US and is trying to save itself by expanding to other countries as well.\n* Both have a massive amount of debt and negative cash flow.\n* Most of ACB's assets are in goodwill while most of Netflix's assets are in its original content. Amortization is in huge play here on their balance sheets.\n* Netflix\\[7\\] has an average of 7 letters per word. Aurora\\[6\\] Cannabis\\[8\\] also has an average of 7 letters per word.\n* Aurora's original logo was black with blue art.  It's rebrand to Drift is red. Netflix's original logo was black with blue art and was later changed to red.\n* ACB was extremely overvalued at its peak. Netflix is currently considered overvalued with a P/E of 105.\n* Reed and Terry, the CEO's of both companies, both have the letter E and two of the same letter in a row in their first name.\n\n`</shitpost>`", "id": "ehi67o", "created_utc": 1577686127.0, "score": 95, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "Why is this flaired as shitpost, this is top 3 best DD i've seen on this sub", "score": 103, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.015097234398126602}, {"body": "I think Netflix buys ACB because of the overlap of their viewers and stoners", "score": 35, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "GOt it\n\nall in on put weeklies", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Based on my autist analysis, $NFLX will drop this week to $318 then rally up to $362 where it will begin to crash and burn throughout the next year.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Buy puts against netflix for friday.
