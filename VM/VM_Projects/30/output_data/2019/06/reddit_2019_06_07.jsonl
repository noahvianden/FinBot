MSFT dipped to like 120 after the news. We're only recovering on hope of a rate cut and hints by Powell that there might be one. Second, investors don't care about MSFT gaming that much, it's mostly about what they're doing with the cloud. I wouldn't expect much of a bump from anything from E3. If you do buy calls though, best time is when the price is low, so if its as low as you think it'll go before E3 then that's as good as you're gonna get.\n\nAs for ATVI. I wouldn't expect a big stock bump for them unless they announce Overwatch Battle Royale, or something similar. ATVI is however near what I believe is its bottom, so most likely it will go up just because gaming will be hype for about a week. The problem with ATVI is it's dead money until we get some big news or earnings start to get better. I'd buy the stock, but not bet on calls. Only way, like I said, that it gets a substantial gain is with a battle toyale game reveal.\n\nNo these stocks will rise off of announcements from the companies, not time leading up to the event.\n\nI like EA more than both of these. I think we know everything about what's coming from them, but they might have some small surprises. However, EA has been to mid 100s and I think it'll reach that again on Star Wars and Apex hype, and could be E3 week. Thing is, market needs to be in good shape as a whole for that to happen. Gaming stocks almost always drop with the market, like investors have no patience for holding game companies when things look bad. \n\nPersonally, I see no good call plays here.

The answer is three big things to look for: \n\n1) Incredibly Low float- just 11m shares \n\n2) Highly Shorted - 51% short, 160% borrow rate \n\n3) The Hype - more art than science. \n\n**There are a LOT of shitty stocks with low floats and that are highly shorted.** Penny stocks, Chinese Meme stocks, off brand electric car companies, etc. **The difference between those POSs and this POS is hype.** To learn how to spot beautiful hype in the wild, I recommend you read the following introduction from Beyond Meat's conference call. If you can read the following few paragraphs without getting goosebumps or imagining someone in a black turtleneck on a stage explaining how they can transform lead into gold, you are missing the crucial third ingredient in your \"Why isn't my shitty stock rallying like this?\" question. These types of speeches typically only happen at the choicest parts of a bull market- so enjoy it while it lasts. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Given that many of you are new to our story, I want to take a little more time on this first call to provide an overview of our business model and global growth strategy. At Beyond Meat, our focus is squarely on the center of the plate protein, a segment traditionally is seen very little in step change innovation. We began with a simple question, do you need an animal to produce meat? The common understanding of meat is it has to come from a chicken, cow or pig or some other type of animal.\n\nWhen we think about meat, we define it in terms of its composition. And as it turns out, meat is at a high-level, an assembly of amino acids, lipids, trace minerals and vitamins and water. We\u2019ve developed a scientific and technological understanding as well as infrastructure over the past decade to assemble these core parts into the architecture of meat, drawing directly from plant-based sources.\n\nWe understand and use the architecture of meat to present these inputs in a way that to the best of our ability today offers the same satisfying taste, texture, aroma and nutritional benefits as animal-based meats. So instead of running plant materials in the form of feed to an animal to build meat, we are bypassing the animal and using plants to build meat directly.\n\nWe view our work as a progression of advancements, some big, most incremental toward a build of meat from plants is indistinguishable from its animal protein equivalent. Since the first days of the company, we do this in dialogue with the consumer. The voice of the consumer is deeply embedded in our products. We ask our scientists and engineers what can science do, but we ask the consumer what should science do. And here is what they told us. They\u2019ve made it very clear that they don\u2019t want \\[indiscernible\\] in their food, that they don't want artificial ingredients, that they feel they have too much soy and wheat in their diets already, they want familiar and short ingredient list.\n\nIt is this dialogue that led us to trademark the phrase \"eat what you love, because we believe that we are enabling consumers and their families to continue to enjoy and even increase their consumption of burgers and sausage by using our plant-based meats and avoiding some of the concerns they may have around animal derived meats.\"", "id": "bxtguq", "created_utc": 1559906786.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "Great post and you could replace this with TLRY and it would read the same.\n\nMy takeaway as someone with fresh tendies for those with FOMO in the sub:\n\nIf you see shit in the news everyday... and its going up everyday... and the volume is through the roof over and over.... don't fight the tape.
