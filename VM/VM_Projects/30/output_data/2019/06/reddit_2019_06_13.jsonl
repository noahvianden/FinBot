This is betting against ourselves as I see it.\n\nA CSP is easy to roll to avoid assignment, but in a JL this will be far more complicated.\n\nLastly, the added cost, both in commissions and those times when the stock rises, which is what we want to occur, reduces profitability. \n\nMy goal was a simple strategy with few moving parts that have a high percentage of wins.

This is betting against ourselves as I see it.\n\nRight, but that's a standard JL, I was describing a JL where the upside is what you would get if you were to do a 0.30 delta CSP.  Do you see that?  For example:\n\nIf a CSP 0.30 delta had max gain of $1 and you set your profit taking limit for $0.50, then you could look for a JL that would net you $0.50 on the upside.  But overall in the JL scenario you're not getting $1.. you're getting $1.5 or more premium meaning a lower BE/CB for the same profit targets as a CSP.\n\nI agree with you on the other disadvantages, but they're miner compared to getting a lower BE/CB especially if you don't manage it.

It can be with a fake stock, but seeing it in a position will help.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That's right, less downside risk because the credit call spread provides extra premium and the total premium provides upside protection.\n\nOk, so I'll use a real example that shows you a JL that can get the full profit at 50% level as a CSP would with a lower break even:\n\nCSP:  CVS 42d DTE strike 52 0.31 delta $1.10 premium; a 50% profit taker limit would be $0.55; break even = 50.90\n\nJL:  CVS 42 DTE same strike 52 for the short put + credit call spread strikes 54.5/55.5 total premium $1.55; the upside max gain (at expiration) is $0.55; break even = 50.45\n\nThe JL also provides a chance to give you the full premium; also a chance to get more than the at-expiration-upside-max based on blacksholes.\n\nI think the above example demonstrates what I'm talking about, but surprisingly it's a bad example because usually when I start my wheel with a JL I can get the short put to have a lower delta reducing my breakeven further.\n\nLike I said, this isn't a standard JL where the upside pays nearly zero; my version of the JL you have to match the upside to what 50% of a 30 delta CSP would get you, and yeah my JL still gives you a higher probability of success over a CSP.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I do these but completely lost me with the jargon.

Seems like over time the put side may be assigned more often, but perhaps this is offset by the added premium collected?\n\nIn my trade plan I would likely be trading the 51 strike for around .80.  If you factor in the lower strike the BEP would be $50.20 ($51 - .80).  As you note in your example it would be $50.45.  Not a lot of difference, but some.\n\nAlso, I know this was just an example, but CVS has a $0.50 Dividend with the ex-date on 7/24 which is 2 days prior to expiration.  As we know a short call can be exercised so the buyer can collect the dividend.  Is this an event you include in your trading plan?\n\nLastly, if these 3 legs do need rolled how do you go about it?  Roll just the CSP?  Or, maybe roll just the call spread?  Roll all legs?\n\nThis is the best explanation of the JL I've seen and I could never really comprehend why we were protecting a trade that profits from a bullish move from a bullish move up!
