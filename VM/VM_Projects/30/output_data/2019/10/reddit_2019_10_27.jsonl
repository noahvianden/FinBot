If we assume they are comfortable with a very small margin of safety (say a week) that would mean they would deliver 105,000 vehicles by Christmas and then spend the next week delivering additional cars.\n\nAssuming zero improvement in S/X over Q3 and a linear growth rate of Model 3 production, they would be at a weekly run rate of 8455 by the last week of 2019.  Assuming they only deliver half that many additional cars in the last week because of holiday time off, they would deliver 109,227 cars in Q4.\n\nIf we then make some pretty conservative assumptions about this quarter's financials, like\n\n* energy revenue stays flat and services revenue grows with deliveries\n* the combined profit margin on energy, services, and other revenue holds steady\n* automotive ASPs and margin hold steady\n* SG&A grows with deliveries\n* R&D grows by the same amount as from Q2 to Q3\n\n**We wind up with a profit of $229m**\n\nIf instead we assume automotive margins improve to 24% and services revenue and SG&A only grow half as fast as deliveries do, **then we instead wind up with a profit of** **$326m**\n\nSo that's my current range of expectations.

(Not to mention better pricing discounts from suppliers.)\n\nAs a rough estimate, 12% more deliveries would improve margins by another 1-2%, and this really matters, because every 1% margin improvement adds about +$50m of profits, all other things equal.\n\nAlso note that despite deliveries going up in Q3 compared to Q2, SG&A actually ***dropped*** significantly even in absolute terms and went down from $647m to $596m, an 8% reduction. While I wouldn't expect it to go down from here, I wouldn't bet on any significant increase either.\n\nBut, having said all that, I agree with your $200m-$300m estimate for Q4 GAAP profits, as a baseline figure - should Tesla meet Q4 guidance of at least 105k deliveries.\n\nFinally, **the magic Q4 profit threshold to watch is $266m**, that is the profit level after which even minimal Q1 profits would trigger immediate S&P 500 inclusion of Tesla around May next year.

Plus there's a *lot* of hedge funds who try to front-run the index funds and try to estimate S&P 500 inclusion probabilities *before* the earnings report that makes it clear that it's probable to happen.\n\nA good demonstration of this process is when Twitter was included in the S&P 500 in 2018 - which was a bit of a surprise event. Twitter ($TWTR) was included in the S&P 500 in June 2018: price went from ~$28 to over $45, a +65% increase, which was sustained until Q2 results were announced in late July 2018.\n\nInterestingly, [when Twitter announced their Q1 profitability on April 25 2018, shares only rose by +13% on the next day](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/25/twitter-earnings-q1-2018.html) - IMO many traders didn't realize the S&P 500 inclusion effects. The CNBC geniuses didn't even *mention* the likely S&P 500 inclusion event.\n\nWhile the \"correlation might not imply causation\" warning clearly applies, IMO Twitter's +65% rise it was clearly mostly due to a S&P 500 inclusion bubble: Q2 results marked revenue growth and continued GAAP profitability, yet the bubble deflated to \n\nI'd expect about ~5% of TSLA to be bought by passive index funds alone (i.e. 9 million shares - more than the Saudi investment last year) - plus a lot of other funds and money managers that only invest in S&P 500 companies, which could easily be twice the passive index fund demand.\n\nBTW., an interesting comparison: Twitter's market cap was about half of Tesla's - so their initial inclusion weight was much lower.
