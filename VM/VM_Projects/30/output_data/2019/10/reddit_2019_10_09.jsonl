Everyone misses this one and it's why 90% this sub thinks crashes are short money printers. SPY can shed 15% in 3 days and gain back 12% *intraday* on no news. 12% is spy rallying to 326 tomorrow.

We didn't qualify for HARP because there were income requirements and she never stopped paying the mortgage.    Biggest joke of them all right there.  The folks paying the bills on time just kept on working and getting fucked by the banks that let it all happen in the first place.    In order to get any  sort of relief from the housing crash, if I recall right, you had to exhaust all resources, and get way behind on your mortgage before you could qualify.   Couldn't afford to do that as it would have  submarined my credit and caused big problems at work.  But I'd by lying if I said we didn't think about it.   We even joked around about getting divorced just so she could say fuck that house and let the bank have it.  Paying two mortgages sucks.    I learned a couple of  important lesson from all that.  1) Houses can go down in value.    2)  When shit hits the fan (for real, not this 2% shit we are dealing with now, I mean an actual crash where the Dow is down 9% and nobody's bidding)  have cash ready to go when it's over and get ready to hold everything you buy for years and years to ride the recovery all the way out.   I remember buying Ford at $1.00 after that shitstorm, and sold it at $4.00 because I was still gunshy and headlines were making me nervous, blah blah.  Even back then, finance news wanted you scared all the time.   If you look at the 10 year chart on any stock you'll see what you could have bought it at back then.

We're living in a time of experimental central bank tactics and negative interest rates. A lot of people just \"buy the payment\", but that's about as fucking stupid as it gets.
