{"title": "Why I'm bullish on tesla off the top of my head", "selftext": "I know on paper tesla looks terrifying but the vast majority of drivers drive I.C.E. cars (internal combustion engine, another word for gasoline vehicles). Currently in 2019 I think only less than 2% of cars on the road are electric, this means there is A LOT of room for growth. On top of this Tesla already produces the best of the best electric vehicles and old car manufactures are unable to compete. Tesla is decades ahead on technology compared to the rest of the world when it comes to electric vehicles. It quite funny, other car companies are releasing electric vehicles in 2019 that don't even beat Teslas very first car that came out in 2012! I'm very bullish on this case alone but tesla has so many other avenues for growth it's truly mind boggling. I'll quickly summarize the other growth factor and can go in more detail if you're interested.\n\n1. Self driving vehicles, tesla is working on self driving vehicles which could allow them to have their own \"uber\" company in the future. Once again, tesla is wayyyyy ahead on the competition when it come to self driving. (They also plan on selling self driving semi trucks within the next few years and Elon estimates that car will be 100% self drivable in less than 5 years. (I'm really excited for this because self driving cars are a lot safer than human driven cars, and less traffic because self driving cars are also statically proven to be much more efficient!\n\n2. Self driving cars leads me to my second point, tesla insurance. Elon has his own insurance for Teslas because Teslas are statistically way safer cars (and will become safer as self driving is implemented) I don't know much about insurance tbh but I know Warren buffet got rich off of buying an insurance company and Elon has his own the far exceeds what other companies offer (only for Teslas which is kinda creating its own ecosystem, same with their tesla \"uber\" service\n\n3. Tesla has a premium super charger network. So basically this means if you need to fill up your tesla, you have to go to a charging station, similar to a gas station, the only difference is when you fill up you're giving your money to tesla, so it's almost like tesla owns the gas stations aswell! Also tesla allows other vehicles to charge at their stations which means more $ for tesla. Also no other car company has even 1/10 of the amount of charging stations as tesla.\n\n4. Solar roofing tiles/ battery storage. As if there aren't enough reasons to be bullish on tesla I saved the best for last. So tesla can essentially save every person (who lives in a sunny state) money by installing solar panels on their roof, they can do it cheaper than most other companies aswell and their tech is very impressive. Buying their solar panels is a no brainer and can the original cost to buy the solar panels pays itself off in about a year. Also they can install a battery into your house which you can use to charge your tesla (for free) and you can even sell the electric you don't use back to the grid or just use it for your house... so like I said it's a no brainer to get especially if someone live in a sunny state.\n\nRandom other thoughts, once a democratic politician gets in office, there will likely be huge incentives to both electric cars and solar panels, may as well buy in now while theres a ton of ridiculous news going on about tesla. Also keep in mind Elon musk is a brilliant human who owns space X which makes them loads and loads of money which Elon uses for tesla, also Elon can raise money with a snap of a finger, so Tesla isn't actually in a danger like the media loves to portray. Also Elon musk is really popular among the youth, he's in a lot of memes, tons of popular youtubers have Teslas and constantly praise the vehicle so all those viewers will consider buying a tesla and all the kids that idolize Elon will also likely buy a tesla.\n\nOh my, I almost forgot..... Elon is about to finish the tesla gigafactory in China and Elon is also on the board of China's envirmomental government agency or something like that (he has an \"in\" with china) and china is also a HUGE market for electric vehicles. I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting but yea I'm bullish on tesla :)\n\nEdit: one more thing I just remembered, tesla is completely self integrated, they produce all of their parts in house and they just bought Maxwell Technologies and will make their own batteries which is a huge deal (no other car company does that) Elon even \"joked\" about getting into the mining business and mining the minerals they need instead of buying it from others.", "id": "d62t6w", "created_utc": 1568834798.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "And don\u2019t forget about the Starlink internet and Boring Company. \nYes I am buying TSLA.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I think you\u2019re bullish for the wrong reasons at the wrong time.\n\nThere is really one main reason to own Tesla and that\u2019s Elon. I mean, without looking it up, think of the name the CEO of Ford, GM or VW. Can\u2019t think of it? I couldn\u2019t.\n\nWhat you bet on with Tesla is the next new thing. Their electric cars are the iPhones of cars, and while they\u2019ve been stagnant for a while, there\u2019s a greater chance for a next new development with Tesla than there is with any other car company. There\u2019s also the possibility for an unknown factor to come into play, like when Apple opened the App Store.\n\nI think the timing is wrong in that it\u2019s too early. I\u2019m near term bearish on them in part because Elon\u2019s attention seems partly focused on SpaceX and those satellites he\u2019s sending up. The next phase for Tesla might come from that development though. Either that or 5G connectivity for the cars, with that constant communication then the system can become greatly optimized. It might be as interesting as the developments in Detroit\u2019s smart traffic management system rollout. \n\nThis is all conjecture, but still lol.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "> What you bet on with Tesla is the next new thing. Their electric cars are the iPhones of cars, **and while they\u2019ve been stagnant for a while**, there\u2019s a greater chance for a next new development with Tesla than there is with any other car company.\n\nDepends upon what you mean by 'they've been stagnant for a while'. In terms of stock price, they're essentially at the same place they were 5 years ago. But 5 years ago Tesla had one car on the market, the Tesla Model S. Lets be frank, the stock was definitely overvalued 5 years ago. But now look at what the company has done since then that says that their share price today is now justified.\n\n* Brought the Model X to the market in 2015 (admittedly they don't sell that many because of the high price tag, but it's a lot of profit per car sold).\n\n* Have vastly expanded their super charger network in much of the world, a serious competitive advantage over other EV's.\n\n* Brought the Model 3 to market in 2017, and brought to near the top of a lot of best selling car lists. [This Image](https://cleantechnica.com/files/2019/08/Tesla-Model-3-vs-Luxury-Car-Sales-by-Brand-Q2-2019.png) from the 2nd quarter of 2019, which combines a number of similar cars from competing auto-makers shows just how massive a lead the Model 3 has in sales. [This image](https://cleantechnica.com/files/2019/08/Tesla-Model-3-vs-Luxury-Car-Sales-Q2-2019.png) lists the cars individually.\n\n* Despite only selling luxury cars, Tesla is selling their cars to lots of people who don't normally buy luxury cars (i.e. they're expanding the market segment), as seen by their [top 5 most commonly traded in cars](https://electrek.co/2018/08/01/tesla-model-3-top-5-trade-in-cars/). Non-luxury cars on the list include the Toyota Prius, Honda Accord & Civic, & Nissan Leaf. (BMW 3-Series is the only luxury car in their top 5).\n\n* So far all the hyped up 'Tesla Killers' have all failed miserably at making much of a dent in their sales when brought to market. Even Tesla bears have started to admit in the last few months that Tesla killers from the competition aren't coming anytime soon.\n\n* After losing money for years Tesla finally had 2 profitable quarters in 2018, and their unprofitable quarters are getting less unprofitable then they used to be, so their financial situation is clearly improving. And there's reason to expect the financial situation to continue to improve with the China giga-factory coming online by the end of this (cutting off a 25% import duty on Tesla's in China), and the Model Y in the next year or two (which will probably sell better then the 3 in the US).\n\nMy point, if you're a Tesla investor and you look back at what they've done in the last 5 years, you should feel pretty pleased with what they've accomplished.

Their autopilot innovation is ongoing, they have world class autolabeling, a 140TOPS ASIC that draws 72W, smart summon about to release, and HW4 is in development with a claimed 420 TOPS with similar power requirements. This alone makes Tesla incredibly valuable, their data set is peerless, and their progress is staggering.\n\nEqually impressive is their quest for \"lights out\" production. Their recent patents on rigid wiring harnesses and multiplexing data signals to reduce the wiring requirements from 1km of wire to 100m of wire is spectactular. This combined with their in house assembly robot division engineering a press that will reduce the number of chassis welds from 70 to under 10. Tesla claims they're new suite of assembly innovations will reduce COGS  related to assembly by 50%. The pathway to an \"alien juggernaut\" is clear.\n\nTheir battery innovations are spectacular.  They recently bought maxwell technologies for their dry press cathode manufacturing IP.  This technology reduces the footprint of cell manufacturing by 16x, eliminates drying ovens and toxic N-methylpyrrolidone use. Most importantly the technique improves the cathode lithium oxide utilization within the cathode. Existing solvent based techniques cause much of the expensive NCA (or other cathode oxide) to get stuck inside an inaccessible part of the graphite cathode. The new process improves utilization allowing higher energy density without using more oxide material. The company said in their publications that there is a \"clear path to 500kWh/kg\".  At this level of energy density, batteries are suitable for powering intercontinental aircraft . This represents a tectonic shift in the total addressable market for tesla's products. All this with a cost savings of 20-30% in production without considering the reduced oxide utilization.\n\nAgain on the battery front. The recent patent filing around single crystal cathode oxide fabrication shows that Tesla's new cathodes will be able to sustain thousands (as opposed to hundreds) of complete 0 to 100% 1C cycles. This technology represents million mile+ capabilities for future tesla EVs AND the ruggedness and total cost of ownership that makes Tesla's new batteries a competitor for stationary storage projected to be a 500 billion$ market.\n\nThis is just a small sample of the stuff Tesla is doing faster and better than anyone else. \n\nLike I say, you need to do some more research.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Again, all that is fascinating and great but generally means little to the common consumer.

So why are you making a fuss about a \"garish\" wall charger.\n\nThat's not true at all, many people do care about that sort of thing and making a spurious connection between two unrelated things doesn't do anything to demonstrate that. Of course, like I said, wall chargers can not make sense for a lot of people, particularly city dwellers without garages and people who live in apartments in general, and for them the less than omnipresent availability of charging stations and having to wait an hour and fifteen minutes to get a full charge to go 150-200 miles presents more than a minor inconvenience. Just one of those easy problems to ignore when feeling optimistic. And something like 70% of new vehicle sales are light trucks and SUVs that require longer charging times and have shorter ranges. But, whatever, right?\n\n>Most cars are more expensive than a Civic. The fact that that EVs start at ~$30k is not a problem. The average cost of a new car in America is ~$34k. Again, it doesn't need to be perfect for everyone, just enough people.\n\nYou think you're making an honest comparison by comparing the cheapest electric cars to the average gas car? EVs still have a long way to go before they become on par with gas cars in terms of purchase price. If you want to cite what EVs start at, comparing them to what ICEVs \"start at\" is what makes sense. But that wouldn't be convenient, would it? It's another inconvenient fact you choose to ignore in order to make an apples to oranges comparison to disingenuously make your point. That average number is inflated by the correspondingly higher cost of SUVs and light trucks, while the starting cost of EVs reflects sedans and coupes. A more honest apples to apples comparison that would paint a more accurate picture of the challenges of acceptance of EVs would have been of typical gas sedans and coupes to similar EVs. \n\n>You just need to plug it in when you enter the garage, this isn't hard. The fact that you think this is a problem just shows the weakness of your argument.\n\nNo, it just shows how your argument's reliance on optimism indicates how weak it is. Your lack of understanding of inconvenient realities does you no favors.\n\n>~5% of vehicles sold in the US last year were plug in cars, and that percentage is clearly on the way up with that number nearly doubling from what it was in 2017. With more of them being introduced in the next year I'm sure it will continue to rise. It's very clearly \"going to be a thing\" very soon.\n\nElectric cars still only constitute about a tenth of a percent of all registered vehicles. Citing a barely significant statistic like 5% share of new cars sold in one year doesn't mean much considering how much more they need to sell to make enough of a dent in the overall number. \n\n>Again, the average price of new cars was $34k last year. I think you underestimate how much is spent on cars and overestimate the inconveniences.\n\nAgain, that's significantly less than EVs. I know what you think, because you'd never allow anything to convince you otherwise, like the limited range, which I'm sure to you is every bit as good as an outlier like Tesla.

Tesla only produced prototype Roadsters in 2006 and first mass-market Model S in 2012 (13 and 7 years ago respectively). 3-5 years ahead in tech, sure. Decades ahead, certainly not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Tesla is approaching autonomy in a more robust way than competitors and, I believe, will reach full autonomy first. I think Tesla's lead in this field is underestimated by Wall St. and may well help Tesla reach $100bn+ valuation within the next 5 years or so.\n2. Technically Tesla does not have their own insurance, they're just acting as a front for State National insurance. Tesla will get a cut of profits but it's unlikely to be a game-changer imo. The main benefits of Tesla insurance are to:\n   1. Simplify insurance.\n   2. Reduce premiums for Tesla drivers to make buying a Tesla a more attractive proposition.\n3. Yes Superchargers are a great moat for Tesla. They have many more charging stations than anyone else in US but their lead is much less outside the US.\n4. Tesla's technology is impressive but whether they can produce solar panels significantly cheaper than competitors is doubtful. Batteries and storage seems to be their main competitive advantage, especially as production ramps. Also, battery installation is not free. It costs several thousand $.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>huge incentives to both electric cars and solar panels\n\nA democrat being elected in 2020 would likely be pro-environment, which would likely benefit Tesla but this is conjecture on conjecture so probably best not to read too much into this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>money which Elon uses for tesla\n\nTesla and SpaceX are separate company. Elon does not use money from one to fund the other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>raise money with a snap of a finger\n\nYes, Elon seems to be able to raise money successfully, although in a recession (more likely than normal in the next few years) raising money becomes more difficult for everyone. Also Elon raising money at Tesla comes at a high price due to Tesla's poor credit rating.\n\nI agree with your points about appealing to young people via YouTube etc. This is one of Tesla's main strengths and will serve them well in the next decade or two.\n\nTesla's vertical integration is very important to Tesla's success and will be help Tesla control costs and improve pace of innovation vs. competitors.
