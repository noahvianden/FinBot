That cash generated will likely be enough to pay back the Solar City debt and will also bring some returns - even if none of the other Solar City derived businesses make money.\n\nI.e. Solar City was a \"bank\" with a good portfolio of outstanding long term loans to customers, facing a bank run - and was bailed out by Tesla, and Tesla shareholders gained value in the fire sale.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Well put.

The present value amount paid + debt incurred is never going to be recouped by Tesla. If Tesla\u2019s board failed to disclose material information to shareholders prior to the deal, they at a minimum breached their fiduciary duty and possibly committed fraud.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "> Except there were no other potential buyers \n\nFirstly, Tesla was already a creditor of Solar City at the time, which gave it both an insight into the financial status of company, and an extra incentive to buy it.\n\nSecondly, it's also irrelevant whether there were any other buyers: there were no other buyers of various distressed banks either in 2008 when they merged with other banks - and quite a few of those mergers were legalized theft of the assets of those distressed banks that just didn't have the short term liquidity and faced a \"bank run\".\n\nAgain, the short term liquidity status of a company has no relation to its long term value. It was well understood at the time that Solar City was distressed: you only had to look at the short term cash burn rate. It was a widely and loudly shorted stock, Jim Chanos became a Tesla short through Solar City.\n\nIf these lawyers base their case on *that* primarily then they don't have much of a case and are just angling for a quick settlement.\n\n> the alleged actions of the board caused Tesla to grossly overpay for SolarCity. \n\nThat's not clear at all, and I suspect not even the court case can settle this, unless it goes on for another ~35 years, which is roughly the time how long these leases run, with a renewal event in ~15 years.\n\n> Lacking other buyers, Tesla should have acquired SolarCity for basically nothing and wiped out the equity of SolarCity shareholders or bought SolarCity out of chapter 7. \n\nIt's not *at all* clear that there wouldn't have been other buyers or a recapitalization of Solar City with new investors had Tesla not shown strategic interest in a merger. Many companies will avoid takeover battles and go for simple buyouts.\n\nAgain, the fact that Solar City didn't have enough cash doesn't mean it couldn't have acquired it through a worse deal than they made with Tesla.\n\nAllowing Solar City to actually go bankrupt would have destroyed the brand value and market position, and put its future business into doubt: in 2008 half a dozen mergers happened, but only Lehman was allowed to go bankrupt, with disastrous consequences.\n\nTesla clearly bought Solar City for the solar business and thought that the value of its leases and its future sales would cover its obligations plus the purchase price.\n\n> Indeed, Tesla almost certainly lost value on the deal. \n\nFirstly, even if after ~35 years we look back and determine that Tesla has lost value on the deal, that won't create liability: mergers and buyouts are fundamentally speculative and they can go wrong and do go wrong all the time - nobody has a crystal ball - but at this point the worst that the lawyers can point at is a broad break-even deal, or a small loss - with the benefit of many years of hindsight ...\n\nIf \"value loss\" was actionable then no company would ever buy another company. This is why these lawyers and the TSLAQ scammers are misleading about this case, to try to force a settlement.\n\nMore importantly, **your statement is also 100% wrong**: we will only know whether the Solar City deal created value in ~15+20 years which is the run time of the leases... Actual return and value depends on the default rate of these homeowners (which rate is low so far), plus on renewal rate percentage when the first phase of the lease runs out.\n\nNeither of these values can be predicted in advance (there might or might not be another 2008 style recession in that time frame, nor do we know what the renewal behavior of lessees will be), let alone with 'certainty'.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Secondly, it's also irrelevant whether there were any other buyers: there were no other buyers of various distressed banks either in 2008 when they merged with other banks - and quite a few of those mergers were legalized theft of the assets of those distressed banks that just didn't have the short term liquidity and faced a \"bank run\".\n\nExcept that when the FDIC shuts down a bank (at least in the US), the receiving bank often nothing or picks and chooses the pieces of the business it wants and jettisons the rest. Yes, its legalized theft but its part of the game you play if you want to run a bank. If you can't immunize your bank to interest rate, credit, and timing risk, you are in the wrong business. \n\n> Again, the short term liquidity status of a company has no relation to its long term value.\n\nHave to disagree with this. If a company is facing a liquidity threat, it clearly has less value. A company which makes $1 million a year but has a 50% chance of facing a \"bank run\" is clearly not as a valuable as a company that makes $1 million a year with no chance of a \"bank run\". \n\n> Tesla clearly bought Solar City for the solar business and thought that the value of its leases and its future sales would cover its obligations plus the purchase price.\n\nThe [last 10-k](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1408356/000156459017003084/scty-10k_20161231.htm#Consolidated_Statements_of_Operations) from SolarCity showed it was *losing $800 million* annually.

Tesla paid $2.6 billion for this. \n\n> More importantly, your statement is also 100% wrong: we will only know whether the Solar City deal created value in ~15+20 years which is the run time of the leases.\n\nA dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. Its possible that by the end of 35 years, the total revenue for SolarCity exceeds the cost of that revenue. Sure. Pretty much everyone doubts it and Tesla hasn't presented any audited financials that break out all SolarCity-related revenue and costs--its all meddled together with organic Tesla initiatives in the \"energy generation and storage\" line.
