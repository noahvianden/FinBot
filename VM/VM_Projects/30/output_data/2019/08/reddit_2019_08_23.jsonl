Previously they had slapped a big ol' Made in the US of A tag on the outside of their pillow BUT the inside was made in gyna...it even HAD a tag saying so.

Plus for whatever reason the market likes TGT.\n\nThe market is irrational (Read stupid as fuck.) therefor TGTs price will probably continue to fall / consolidate this week, then when tariffs hit September 2nd and 3rd the market will again over react and bring TGT down with it. (You're puts sound good in this environment.)\n\nWe could monitor the position for a little bit, then when the market calms back down and \"gets used\" to the tariffs affecting prices, we go long until it's next earnings when it's price is bottoming out.  It's earning last year came out around late November. I say long calls into December time frame, this way time delay won't totally fuck us.\n\nIf you can actually find out how much tariffs will actually affect TGT that would be pertinent.  If the market overreacts and expects tariffs to hit retail a lot harder than it should, but we know that Target will not really be as affected as other retailers when it beats earnings expectations, the market will over react and say \"LOOK HOW GOOD TGT IS DOING\" and rally the stock. All while we sell into the Rally making a profit. (This is dependent on the market overreacting to Targets impact by the tariffs INITIALLY and PRICING IN tariff expectations.) \n\nHowever this is dependent on finding out the D&D with how much tariffs will affect the stock, if everything looks good, and the market over reacts in September we can get a cheap buy, on a good company, that isn't affected by tariffs that we can project will do better than expected when earnings show up again.\n\nThis is on the assumption that Target is not impacted more so than other retailers.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tgt"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Sir, this is a Target.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
