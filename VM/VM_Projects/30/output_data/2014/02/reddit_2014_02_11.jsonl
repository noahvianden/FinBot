Calls, however, could result in a hypothetical infinite loss for the option writer because the underlying asset has no maximum limit for how much it can appreciate. If the writer does not buy back the contract, it could be exercised and the writer will be obligated to purchase the stock at any price so long as it's in the money. \n\nSounds kind of scary, but a stock is not going to go from $10/share to $10,000,000,000 or more a share, so the loss isn't really going to be \"infinite.\" ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What would the option be called in my stock account to do that?

To get to this level of options trading, you probably will need a few years experience of just buying options or selling covered options (or cash secured puts).

I don't have the ability to sell naked options in my account, so I'm not 100% sure of everything that goes into that, but I'm pretty sure you also need some sort of margin account in case the option you write expires in the money and you have to buy shares.
