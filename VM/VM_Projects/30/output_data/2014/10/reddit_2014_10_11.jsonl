The Assets-Liabilities figure is called Shareholder's Equity, and Tesla has $952 million of shareholders equity, and this figure is used to determine the price-to-book value of a company (which is 31 for Tesla). However, this isn't a very good metric because it neglects brand-name, patents and other intellectual property, as well as other reasons, read more [here](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental/03/112603.asp). A better metric is Price per Earnings or P/E, which is astronomical now because Tesla has small non-GAAP profits, but will come down significantly as the company grows.\n\nThe reason Tesla is so highly valued is because they have met all of their business goals with excellent execution, and are taking many steps to be selling at least 500,000 cars at an average selling price of ~$58,000 by 2020. They also have the goal of getting to 15% operating margins in the future. So if we take this information and add a tax rate of 25%, then the net income in 2020 would be $3.26 billion and using a 20 P/E (this is a slight premium to the 15 P/E average for the auto industry because of high growth) will get a valuation of $65.25 billion in 2020.  If we assume that the amount of shares goes up significantly to 145 million from today's 124.6 million, the per share price in 2020 would be $450. Discounting that at a high market rate of 8% per year over 6 years, we get the stock is worth $284 at the end of 2014 assuming that the company executes their plan. Currently, many people believe that Tesla will execute decently well on their plan as the stock is at $237. Using all the same numbers, the stock is currently pricing in that Tesla will sell about 420,000 cars in 2020 and that will represent all of their revenue. However, the stock does not take into account that Tesla plans to enter the battery storage industry, or that extra revenues can come from developing electric cars for partners, or allowing other car manufacturers to use their fast charging network for a pretty penny. \n\nSo overall, the main idea is that Tesla is a growth company, and it burns through money because it is expanding in so many different ways. But within the next few years, Tesla will become more and more profitable and sell more and more cars and grow into their valuation. When looking at the fundamentals of a growth stock, you can't look at their current financials and say they are overvalued, you have to look at future potential and likely-hood that they will execute their goals (a lot of investors currently believe in Tesla, thus the high price). So eventually, Tesla will grow into their valuation as long as they execute.\n\nTL;DR Tesla is a growth company and therefore burns through cash and will eventually grow into their valuation provided that they execute at least decently well.\n\nEDIT: Why the downvotes?
