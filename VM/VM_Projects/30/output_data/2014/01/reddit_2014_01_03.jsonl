{"title": "ONCS... Perspective from a Scientist.", "selftext": "I wrote this earlier and I thought I'd share here considering the hum lately about this stock.\n\nI'm a biologist working in a lab and I conduct experiments similar to those done by ONCS (we routinely do electroporation) and I thought I'd offer some perspective. \n\nFirstly, to be in collaboration with UCSF is an immediate green light--UCSF has one of the most comprehensive, well respected medical departments in the entire world.   This first and foremost puts this company on a pedestal.\n\nNow, the best part about this company is what made that collaboration possible.  From a scientific point of view-what OncoSec is doing with its cancer treatments is similar to what many cutting-edge researchers are doing.  Electroporation is a technique to introduce a small dosage of substance into a cell.  As I mentioned above, I routinely do experiments where I use this technique to introduce DNA into cells. In one of their trials, OncoSec is using electroporation to introduce a plasmid (a DNA construct that codes for a protein), causing the immune system to acknowledge the cell as foreign and target it.  This is brilliant! Basically, the only problem with cancer is that your body doesn't recognize that cancerous cells are bad. As a result, the immune system ignores them and the cells grow and grow until they overwhelm your body and you die.  By introducing this protein (IL-12), however, they're labeling the cancer cells as bad enabling the body to naturally get rid of them. From a scientific point of view, this is truly a brilliant technique.  To support my point further, consider this: this is a treatment already as effective as surgery and IT'S ONLY IN CLINICAL TRIALS! There is incredible room for growth here, and incredible scientific potential.  This is the future of cancer therapy--It's literally the next Apple of bioengineering! \n\nThis stock is horrendously undervalued considering OncoSec's collaborations and technologies--I would buy at $10 in a heartbeat.  \n\nI hope my perspective helped, it's imperative that everyone understands this opportunity.\n\nGood luck to all!\n\nEdit: Typo", "id": "1uau0p", "created_utc": 1388738916.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 39, "comments": [{"body": "> collaboration with UCSF...puts this company on a pedestal.....cutting-edge...This is brilliant!.....this is truly a brilliant technique.....IT'S ONLY IN CLINICAL TRIALS!.....incredible room for growth here, and incredible scientific potential.....the future of cancer therapy--It's literally the next Apple of bioengineering!...I would buy at $10 in a heartbeat...it's imperative that everyone understands this opportunity\n\nYou call yourself a scientist, but you sound more like a salesman.

I have not done a ton of research on ONCS to figure out exactly what their protocol is, but how do they go from doing electroporation, which introduces foreign DNA into single cells through high voltage, and is not a very specific technique (the reason it works in vitro is we only really grow up a dish of one cell type at a time) to making a successful drug in humans, which have tons of different cell types? \n\nEdit: So electroporation can be done on a larger scale (like on a tumor mass), but that still doesn't solve the problem of how to get the DNA to the target area by the time of electroporation. Are you saturating the blood supply with the DNA and then using an electroporation burst on an extremely controlled area? What if the tumor is large enough to have hypoxic areas where vasculature isn't close enough for the DNA to enter the cell? I'd like to hear your take OP.\n\nAlso, a treatment as effective as surgery is not a very good treatment for removing cancer. Unless the tumor mass is completely contained, we're talking about trying to remove mets, single migrating cells, a tumor mass, and potentially atypical but phenotypically \"normal\" cells. Surgery is a terrible treatment, that's why we have more detrimental techniques like chemotherapy and radiation treatment.
