This is already starting to snow ball as more investors see that bonds will soon crash as a result of credit contracting they are going to initiate the self full filling prophecy by closing their investments in the funds and when a large enough fund goes belly up and has to liquidate all of its bonds on the open market to satisfy investor withdrawals the game is over.\n\n2) Major Default (Credit swaps) - Because of the absolute destruction in the price of all commodities lately resource companies are getting hammered. Most of the large one (you have probably heard of Glen Core recently) have taken out substantial loans when prices were high and now they aren't making enough money to even cover the interest. They are scrambling to get loans so they can roll over existing debt. When a large enough resource company defaults on a its loan its not that catastrophic accept that many people buy credit swaps (derivatives) against those loans and the originators (think AIG 2008) go belly up because they can't pay out on swaps. This cascades until it blows up.\n\n3) Geo-Political Event - A major terrorist attack or war escalation will send the markets cratering lower and expedite either of the 2 scenarios listed above.\n\nWe have maybe 6 months max before one of these things happen but I would wager we don't make out of next quarter before it does...\n", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "First of all have an up vote for actually posting something that made me think over my beer for a minute.\n\nNow let me ask you a few questions.

The next thing I would ask is that don't you think after a quarter of suppressed prices in bonds that the bond market would start to come back as more investors flock to a safer investment that is yielding higher returns than it has in the past? Also if investors are fleeing the bond market it would make sense that they would come over to stocks and not into cash, don't you think?\n\nAs for situation number 2 I don't think that the price of commodities  has been especially weighing on the market in general. These prices have been decreasing and floating around this depressed price for the last year, and while it has increased the volatility of the market hasn't destroyed it. But I do agree that we will see a consolidation within that market, maybe from defaults but more than likely from M&As.\n\nSituation 3 looks like the one that will be more probable to happen any day now.
