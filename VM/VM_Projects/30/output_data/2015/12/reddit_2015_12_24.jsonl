The creator of this series runs a gold a silver bullion website and in the business of selling gold and silver and his book and created this series to encourage more sales. I'm not advocating in any way that you buy his book or put any or all of your money in Gold or Silver. What I am advocating is that you watch the series because he does one of the best jobs of explaining the our monetary and banking system, its flaws and where its all headed. I believe the fundamental knowledge of our money/banking system will enable you to make better trades by better associating value and recognizing the primary drivers for inflation and deflation and how it affects the market.\n\n[Hidden Secrets of Money - Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DyV0OfU3-FU)\n\n[Hidden Secrets of Money - Episode 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdSq5H7awi8)\n\n[Hidden Secrets of Money - Episode 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-IemeM-Ado)\n\n[Hidden Secrets of Money - Episode 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0)(I would start with this one, its the best of the series)\n\n[Hidden Secrets of Money - Episode 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQWMd_NPSBA)\n\nHidden Secrets of Money - Episode 6 (The Great Deflation) can only be found on his website.

Is there even anyone arguing that near-zero interest rates and QE don't inflate asset prices? You seem to be one of the only people I've seen claim that they don't. It's widely known that raising interest rates used to be the tool of choice to \"cool off\" an overheated economy; it only makes sense that the opposite stimulates the economy and generally leads to higher asset prices. Stock prices don't exist in a vacuum, the discount rate is an important part of determining the expected return of the market.\n\n[Here is an interesting discussion of interest rates policy changes by Brad DeLong.

They buy the dips happily knowing the trend no different than I buy SPXU on the ralleys knowing the market is going down. both are a safe bet. Many of the gold bugs however are smart enough to know that nothing moves in a straight line. I my self know for sure that deflation is going to push gold lower in the short term. What I cant guarantee is that there will be any supply of gold and silver left at those prices. So rather than time the bottom I buy gold and silver now while its still available and short the market at the same time to make up the difference. Why not win both ways and lock in gains if you can. Because when a credit event like 2008 occurs (some time next year) that will be 10x larger than the last, as a bank run occurs for the first time in the US for many generations that have never known what thats like, the panic of the people will lead the government to ban cash(withdrawals) to keeps the banks solvent (There are tons of trial balloon articles already talking about this to push the idea of a \"cashless society\" on the public), they will then go to negative rates (also in the news a lot) as a means of quelling the underlying deflation that is still present and while that will hold things together for a little while longer when the final collapse of this deflationary spiral occurs as economic output stalls under the pressure money literally disappearing both from credit destruction and negative rates eating it away at the money supply they will drop helicopter money in the form of \"basic income\" to the people this time which will be what starts the hyper-inflationary process that all gold bugs know is coming.
