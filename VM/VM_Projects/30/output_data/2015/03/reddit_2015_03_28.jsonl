How do you avoid this? You do fundamental analysis on every company you buy, and then hold out for a solid entry point. Do this and you will be less likely to get cold feet.\n\nThis is because you know why you like the company, and you'll feel like you got a good price when you bought it. Feeling good about your entry point is really important, because otherwise you'll get jittery and worried you should sell. I track maybe a dozen or more companies I have reviewed the fundamentals on and know I like. If they don't also reach a good technical position, I won't buy them.\n\nYou will always have the natural fear of losing out. This will be multiplied massively if you buy and sell a select few favorite companies, because you will *want* them to work. You will convince yourself you should buy when you should not. If you have lots of companies you are interested in, you will ease your own anxiety over missing out and help teach yourself patience.\n\n**With respect to your current positions:**\n\nI would hold Intel and I would consider selling TSLA. I like both companies, but you should have never bought TSLA. Why? Because it's a company that is going to give you cold feet. In my personal opinion, TSLA will reach its low point for the year in the next 2-3 months before the model X comes out. After that, it will probably rebound. But you can't say for sure, and I think some of the confidence in Elon is waning due to Tesla's botched expansion into China. If the market loses faith in Elon the stock will crash hard.\n\nI'm in Intel myself. I bought in because its been on a steady decline, but there has been some resistance around the 30$ level. I bought a little after you, after I saw the price stabilize at 30. I think my cost basis is 29.85. The news on Friday was a nice surprise, but it changes nothing for me. I know why I bought Intel - because its a market leader who owns the entire market for servers. Even if they have no presence in the mobile market now, this is probably something they will address soon. They have a powerful R&D department, and even if they don't expand into mobile computing, the market is not giving them enough credit for the server side of things. News that they may be buying a company who makes FPGAs in order to firmly cement their grip on servers only makes the company more attractive to me.
