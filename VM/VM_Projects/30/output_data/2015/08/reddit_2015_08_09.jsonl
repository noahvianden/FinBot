{"title": "Does anybody have any experience with swing trading (successfully) on Robinhood with modest amounts of money (e.g. 3 k to 10 k)?", "selftext": "I got Robinhood back in December and bought a bunch of hold positions, but seeing how much the market moves up and down as of lately, I am starting to think I will make more gains just by swing trading. My strategy is to find stocks that are pretty solid (that I won't mind being stuck with if they don't swing up for awhile) but bounce up and down a lot...even if it is just by a percent point. JNJ and BTI are two of the stocks I plan on doing this with. Alas though, I am a freshly graduated college student, so I don't have A LOT of funds to do this with. That said, should I go through with this idea, or just use my money for long positions?\nAnd my long positions are mostly things like MO, PM, BTI, RTN, LMT, GE, BA, PEP and shit like that.", "id": "3gax4d", "created_utc": 1439083508.0, "score": 5, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": ">I generally pick a stock that's in a uptrend that I wouldn't mind holding if it crashed.\n\nThat's exactly what I plan to do.
