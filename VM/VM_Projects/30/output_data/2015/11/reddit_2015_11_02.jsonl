I personally think the market(at least the US) is starting to slowly approach an over priced area and we're due for a correction sometime in the near future. I doubt it will be large, maybe another 5-10% at best as the US fundamentals still make it the best area to invest your money but there are long term issues that could affect that(slow downs in China and Europe leading to an overall slow down which would have a negative impact on forward earnings, changes in the fed rate, QE ending or not working in foreign countries). I think some of these are longer term issues that just the next 10-12 months.\n\nPersonally I think earnings growth will be muted in the next 12 months or so due to overseas economic slowdowns and that could have a negative impact on the stock market but I don't think it will be substantial. It's hard to tell how the economy will be after 2016 but if we're seeing a period of prolonged mediocre earnings growth combined with a US stock market that keeps going up then I could see a potential issue for 2017 and onward and that's when we can start talking about crash potentials. \n\nWe're looking at a current P/E of 22 which is high versus the historical average but far from where it was prior to the crashes. It's hard timing the market but I could easily see this P/E rise up to the high 20s before we see any significant corrections simply because at this point in time, the US Stock Market is by far the best place to park your money.
