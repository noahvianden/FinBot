{"title": "Foot Locker shares fall after heavy promotions lead to holiday-quarter losses", "selftext": "Shares of Foot Locker fell in premarket trading Wednesday after the sneaker retailer reported a holiday-quarter loss, issued weak guidance for the current year and said it\u2019s behind on meeting its financial goals.\n\nGiven how poorly its past fiscal year went, the company is now expecting the profitability goal it laid out during its March 2023 investor day to be delayed by two years, Foot Locker\u2019s finance chief Mike Baughn said. It now expects to reach an EBIT margin of 8.5% to 9% by 2028, said Baughn.\n\nHere\u2019s how the company did in its fourth fiscal quarter, compared with estimates from analysts surveyed by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:\n\nEarnings per share: 38 cents adjusted vs. 32 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $2.38 billion vs. $2.28 billion expected\n\nThe company swung to a loss in the three-month period that ended Feb. 3. Foot Locker lost $389 million, or $4.13 per share, compared with an income of $19 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one time items, Foot Locker reported earnings of 38 cents per share.\n\nSales rose slightly to $2.38 billion, up about 2% from $2.34 billion a year earlier.\n\nIn the current fiscal year, Foot Locker is expecting profits to be worse than analysts had expected. It anticipates adjusted earnings per share will be between $1.50 and $1.70, compared with estimates of $1.40 to $2.30, according to LSEG.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, Foot Locker is expecting sales to be between down 1% and up 1%, compared to estimates of down half a percent, according to LSEG.\n\nCEO Mary Dillon said in a statement that Foot Locker managed to drive full-price sales \u201cin addition to compelling promotions\u201d during its holiday quarter. But the retailer\u2019s gross margin fell by 3.5 percentage points \u201cprimarily as a result of higher markdowns.\u201d \n\nWe \u201cproactively reinvested in markdowns to end the year with leaner inventory levels compared to our expectations,\u201d said Dillon. \u201cAs we continue evolving into a modern, omnichannel retailer for \u2018all things sneakers,\u2019 we are making important progress strengthening our brand partnerships, increasing customer engagement, transforming our real estate footprint, and driving growth in digital.\u201d \n\nOverall comparable sales decreased 0.7%, which is better than the 7.9% drop that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Comparable sales at Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker in North America increased 5.2%\n\nIt\u2019s been a little over a year since CEO Mary Dillon took the helm of Foot Locker. During her tenure, sales have consistently fallen as the retailer grappled with a changing mix of sneaker brands and a target consumer that has felt the brunt of inflation more acutely than those in higher income brackets. \n\nFoot Locker has also been repositioning its Champs Sports brand and has grappled with high inventory levels that, unlike its peers, it has struggled to curb. During the quarter, Foot Locker relied on markdowns to reduce inventory levels by 8.2% compared to the prior year.\n\nIn her past life as Ulta Beauty\u2019s chief executive, Dillon skillfully won over buzzy beauty brands and turned the company into a powerhouse cosmetics retailer. When she took over as Foot Locker\u2019s top boss in Sept. 2022, she was seen as the savior the legacy retailer sorely needed. \n\nWhile Dillon inherited a slew of problems that existed long before she took over, and is still highly regarded across the retail industry, her turnaround of Foot Locker has come more slowly than some analysts had expected. \n\nDuring its fiscal third quarter, Foot Locker eked out surprise beats on the top and bottom lines. Dillon told investors the company was making progress with its turnaround initiatives. The company inked a new marketing deal with the NBA, made plans to enter India and said the holiday quarter was off to a strong start.\n\nDillon has also worked to revamp Foot Locker\u2019s store footprint. Many of the retailer\u2019s stores are in underperforming malls, and Dillon wants the company to focus on more experiential stores that are better suited for the communities they operate in. During the fourth quarter, Foot Locker opened 29 new stores, remodeled or relocated 66 locations, and closed 113 stores. \n\nLast March, Dillon touted a renewed and revitalized relationship with Nike, which has long been the largest driver of Foot Locker\u2019s sales. She has also sought to reduce the company\u2019s reliance on the sneaker giant as it has focused on driving direct sales and squeezing out wholesalers.\n\nThe relationship between the two brands still appears to be in a state of flux. On earnings calls, Nike routinely points to Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and JD Finish Line as its treasured wholesale partners.\n\nBut in mid-February, Foot Locker announced a new partnership with its longtime supplier. The partnership, dubbed The Clinic, brings together Foot Locker, Nike and Jordan Brand, and will feature \u201cinteractive activations, high reach media, real life basketball clinics, social media content, community events and more.\u201d \n\nThe partnership officially launched during the 2024 NBA All-Star Game in Indianapolis, In. \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/06/foot-locker-fl-earnings-q4-2023.html\n\nEarnings report: https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/events", "id": "1b7ziqm", "created_utc": 1709731223.0, "score": 158, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "I dont see how Foot locker stays in biz.

In the 5G, and arguably 6G era, edge computing is almost always inferior to cloud computing except for some very special usecases where every millisecond counts e.g., autonomous driving. The thing is, there is no real usecase of On Device AI on the smartphone that wants to support you on your daily tasks, healthcare, decision-making etc, because there is no need for instant computation. You can easily do the computing of all of the data in the cloud on a larger, more complex model, and show the results with a bit of delay on the device afterwards. Who cares about hours of delay of personal healthcare data from your last 6 month training sessions? What you really care about is the quality of the output, not the time it takes to compute it.\n\nI think what will really be the determining factor is whom's AI will be superior in understanding your personal data. If Apple's Siri is a bigger QoL gain for you than Amazon's Alexa, then people will pay for that AI rather than the other. I am inclined to think that Personal AI Advisors is a winner takes all market. It could be an extra service on top of your smartphone that is offered by various big tech firms and depending on the amount you pay you get a better or worse AI. People may use Microsoft's AI on Apple smartphones or their proprietary AI.\n\nSo I dont think this is a hardware issue, as in, who has the best chips that can fit into a tiny smartphone to generate the most complex AI. It will rather be a batte of whom's AI is the best at doing certain tasks for us humans, and then making that accessible via smartphones or similar devices with the computing being done of very complex models in data centers.

It is a very complex matter and to me, AI appears to bring upon us a fundamental shift of many things, first and foremost how we understand and importantly interpret data, but also how we convert this into actual actions.\n\nI see it this way: it takes understanding, energy and actual work to accomplish anything in this world, be it painting a wall, writing a news article, doing cancer research, designing chips, building hardware, coding software, etc. Right now, the understanding, the energy and the actual work is done by humans. But with AI, the former (understanding) will by taken over and we will be primarily doing the physical work required. In order for AI to \"understand\", it requires hardware, software, and data, and of course energy as well.

{"title": "Foot Locker shares fall after heavy promotions lead to holiday-quarter losses", "selftext": "Shares of Foot Locker fell in premarket trading Wednesday after the sneaker retailer reported a holiday-quarter loss, issued weak guidance for the current year and said it\u2019s behind on meeting its financial goals.\n\nGiven how poorly its past fiscal year went, the company is now expecting the profitability goal it laid out during its March 2023 investor day to be delayed by two years, Foot Locker\u2019s finance chief Mike Baughn said. It now expects to reach an EBIT margin of 8.5% to 9% by 2028, said Baughn.\n\nHere\u2019s how the company did in its fourth fiscal quarter, compared with estimates from analysts surveyed by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:\n\nEarnings per share: 38 cents adjusted vs. 32 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $2.38 billion vs. $2.28 billion expected\n\nThe company swung to a loss in the three-month period that ended Feb. 3. Foot Locker lost $389 million, or $4.13 per share, compared with an income of $19 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one time items, Foot Locker reported earnings of 38 cents per share.\n\nSales rose slightly to $2.38 billion, up about 2% from $2.34 billion a year earlier.\n\nIn the current fiscal year, Foot Locker is expecting profits to be worse than analysts had expected. It anticipates adjusted earnings per share will be between $1.50 and $1.70, compared with estimates of $1.40 to $2.30, according to LSEG.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, Foot Locker is expecting sales to be between down 1% and up 1%, compared to estimates of down half a percent, according to LSEG.\n\nCEO Mary Dillon said in a statement that Foot Locker managed to drive full-price sales \u201cin addition to compelling promotions\u201d during its holiday quarter. But the retailer\u2019s gross margin fell by 3.5 percentage points \u201cprimarily as a result of higher markdowns.\u201d \n\nWe \u201cproactively reinvested in markdowns to end the year with leaner inventory levels compared to our expectations,\u201d said Dillon. \u201cAs we continue evolving into a modern, omnichannel retailer for \u2018all things sneakers,\u2019 we are making important progress strengthening our brand partnerships, increasing customer engagement, transforming our real estate footprint, and driving growth in digital.\u201d \n\nOverall comparable sales decreased 0.7%, which is better than the 7.9% drop that analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. Comparable sales at Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker in North America increased 5.2%\n\nIt\u2019s been a little over a year since CEO Mary Dillon took the helm of Foot Locker. During her tenure, sales have consistently fallen as the retailer grappled with a changing mix of sneaker brands and a target consumer that has felt the brunt of inflation more acutely than those in higher income brackets. \n\nFoot Locker has also been repositioning its Champs Sports brand and has grappled with high inventory levels that, unlike its peers, it has struggled to curb. During the quarter, Foot Locker relied on markdowns to reduce inventory levels by 8.2% compared to the prior year.\n\nIn her past life as Ulta Beauty\u2019s chief executive, Dillon skillfully won over buzzy beauty brands and turned the company into a powerhouse cosmetics retailer. When she took over as Foot Locker\u2019s top boss in Sept. 2022, she was seen as the savior the legacy retailer sorely needed. \n\nWhile Dillon inherited a slew of problems that existed long before she took over, and is still highly regarded across the retail industry, her turnaround of Foot Locker has come more slowly than some analysts had expected. \n\nDuring its fiscal third quarter, Foot Locker eked out surprise beats on the top and bottom lines. Dillon told investors the company was making progress with its turnaround initiatives. The company inked a new marketing deal with the NBA, made plans to enter India and said the holiday quarter was off to a strong start.\n\nDillon has also worked to revamp Foot Locker\u2019s store footprint. Many of the retailer\u2019s stores are in underperforming malls, and Dillon wants the company to focus on more experiential stores that are better suited for the communities they operate in. During the fourth quarter, Foot Locker opened 29 new stores, remodeled or relocated 66 locations, and closed 113 stores. \n\nLast March, Dillon touted a renewed and revitalized relationship with Nike, which has long been the largest driver of Foot Locker\u2019s sales. She has also sought to reduce the company\u2019s reliance on the sneaker giant as it has focused on driving direct sales and squeezing out wholesalers.\n\nThe relationship between the two brands still appears to be in a state of flux. On earnings calls, Nike routinely points to Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and JD Finish Line as its treasured wholesale partners.\n\nBut in mid-February, Foot Locker announced a new partnership with its longtime supplier. The partnership, dubbed The Clinic, brings together Foot Locker, Nike and Jordan Brand, and will feature \u201cinteractive activations, high reach media, real life basketball clinics, social media content, community events and more.\u201d \n\nThe partnership officially launched during the 2024 NBA All-Star Game in Indianapolis, In. \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/06/foot-locker-fl-earnings-q4-2023.html\n\nEarnings report: https://investors.footlocker-inc.com/events", "id": "1b7ziqm", "created_utc": 1709731223.0, "score": 158, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "I dont see how Foot locker stays in biz.

In the 5G, and arguably 6G era, edge computing is almost always inferior to cloud computing except for some very special usecases where every millisecond counts e.g., autonomous driving. The thing is, there is no real usecase of On Device AI on the smartphone that wants to support you on your daily tasks, healthcare, decision-making etc, because there is no need for instant computation. You can easily do the computing of all of the data in the cloud on a larger, more complex model, and show the results with a bit of delay on the device afterwards. Who cares about hours of delay of personal healthcare data from your last 6 month training sessions? What you really care about is the quality of the output, not the time it takes to compute it.\n\nI think what will really be the determining factor is whom's AI will be superior in understanding your personal data. If Apple's Siri is a bigger QoL gain for you than Amazon's Alexa, then people will pay for that AI rather than the other. I am inclined to think that Personal AI Advisors is a winner takes all market. It could be an extra service on top of your smartphone that is offered by various big tech firms and depending on the amount you pay you get a better or worse AI. People may use Microsoft's AI on Apple smartphones or their proprietary AI.\n\nSo I dont think this is a hardware issue, as in, who has the best chips that can fit into a tiny smartphone to generate the most complex AI. It will rather be a batte of whom's AI is the best at doing certain tasks for us humans, and then making that accessible via smartphones or similar devices with the computing being done of very complex models in data centers. The future will be ever more connected and in the AI world, better often means not 2x or 4x better but a magnitude or two (10x, 100x) better.

It is a very complex matter and to me, AI appears to bring upon us a fundamental shift of many things, first and foremost how we understand and importantly interpret data, but also how we convert this into actual actions.\n\nI see it this way: it takes understanding, energy and actual work to accomplish anything in this world, be it painting a wall, writing a news article, doing cancer research, designing chips, building hardware, coding software, etc. Right now, the understanding, the energy and the actual work is done by humans. But with AI, the former (understanding) will by taken over and we will be primarily doing the physical work required. In order for AI to \"understand\", it requires hardware, software, and data, and of course energy as well. I think that everything that deals with chips, computing power, data storage and energy production will do very well, because we will require exponential amounts of it. Ofc, physical work is also taken over in some areas, e.g., drones collecting fruits. What we witness right now is just the beginning ofc.\n\nFor apple, I dont think they are in bad shape though. At last, we humans need a sort of interface to make use of AI and it will be primarily the younger generations that will require to interact with AI on a daily basis to harness the biggest benefit for their daily life. And those generations use smartphones and smartwatches. There will most likely be another product, maybe in the sorts of spatial computing that will overtake this.
