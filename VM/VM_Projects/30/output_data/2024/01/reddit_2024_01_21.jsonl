The brilliant chiplet design that OP was fellating? Yeah the 7900M, their high end mobile GPU, made it into exactly one Dell laptop that will be low volume. The rest are getting dumped into a Chinese market desktop GPU which is slightly preferable to throwing them in the trash.

If you buy a \"cheap\" Nvidia product like an RTX 4060, *every* game that is released will be tested against that. Every productivity app that can use GPU acceleration will support it.

Many highly anticipated chips have failed in past because they are too hard to program.   \n\n\nLisa's leadership is indeed strong, but the middle management is not as effective and driven. The employee salaries are kept at middle of the market pay scale unlike Nvidia, so maybe this is what leads employees to not have the motivation/drive to build truly powerful and effective products (typically just marginal improvements rather than groundbreaking strides). At least based on my personal experience.   \n\n\nThe only point which has substance from the technical standpoint is the chiplet bet. However, that remains to be seen. Needs for AI engine require lot of multiply-accumulate operators & memory and when you scale the neural network across chip, networking capabilities too.

And yes, we are also going to be talking about \"Cross border arbitrage\" as one of you were asking and how we are going to use it in our   strategy but just one time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, w/o any further delay let's begin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Recap:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, in our last [newsletter](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18xe8ss/wall_street_newsletter_s03e05_market_outlook_q1/) we talked about \"Hedging\" and how we are going to target specific windows by dividing all OPEX's just like we used to do way before. We categorized them in three windows.\n\n\\- Jan 3rd - Jan CPI/OPEX: Expecting -2% correction with multiple compression. (A down)\n\n\\- Jan CPI/OPEX - Feb OPEX: ATH's and beyond (B up)\n\n\\- Feb OPEX - March OPEX: The most dangerous period (C down)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, an ABC like structure where B is higher than A.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Proof in case someone hasn't got time to read the whole thing.](https://preview.redd.it/812yv8zk0tdc1.png?width=1046&format=png&auto=webp&s=7878d0e462c163c915ca890ce9adcc9a32c441fc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut there is something wrong with this analysis in Jan CPI/OPEX - Feb OPEX and that is what we have to talk about in this upcoming experiment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tldr:**\n\n**Jan OPEX - Feb OPEX**\n\nATHs (current state) -> Down (Till Jan end) -> Up (Feb OPEX) -> Down. See y'all at March Fomc.\n\nDidn't understand it. Read the whole thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Experiments:**\n\nDate: January 21, 2024\n\n\"Let's begin the melt-down\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAssumptions: E constant i.e. 231.xx\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVol events:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpcoming week\n\n\\-> Q4 prelims GDP: January 25 (est 1.7%, Atlanta Fed is at 2.4%)\n\n\\-> PCE & Core PCE: January 26\n\n\\-> Netflix and Tesla guidance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext week\n\n\\-> QRA informal release: January 30, Tuesday\n\n\\-> Fomc live: January 31, Wednesday\n\n\\-> Big Tech Earnings guidance: Microsoft, Google, Apple, Meta,\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFebruary\n\n\\-> Jobs: February 2\n\n\\-> CPI: February 13\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: EOM/BOM flows on 31-1 will give us an idea how things must look like for February just like January. But man, this window is action packed so keep your energy levels high. A lot of turbulence is expected. The door of airplane will pop off in the next window so don't worry about that right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheories:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Vana charm flows:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yi4p06li1tdc1.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=f66acefd0d58a2fb3a1b80d7ced1d289f006e691\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExperiment No 1:\n\nJan OPEX - Feb OPEX can be further classified into two categories:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-> Jan OPEX - Jan end: As you can see from above many events are going to happen in this window. Now out of them Fomc and QRA is the most important ones and that requires hedging. So stock market must go down in this window as there is some risk especially with QRA.\n\n(A down)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/siekbyxl1tdc1.png?width=1116&format=png&auto=webp&s=2761b2193f54ed815d33b3feb64d30c21dd63c1c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-> Jan end - Feb OPEX: This is as simple as you like. We know the hedges have to come off in previous window and then in this window we also have CPI release (Spoiler alert: 0.1% mom headline, 0.3% mom core) which will be euphoric and that will not just end on CPI day but continue till OPEX coz people know about these vana charm flows and they will buy calls till OPEX. Now you must be thinking do we have to go up even more than before. Well I mean 2.9% CPI = 21PE coz back in July 3% CPI was = 20.8 max PE. And we are already pricing close to 20.9 PE right now and the 21PE may get priced on Monday ($4851-$4872 on SPX500) So I think not.\n\n(B up)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rsa1j0hr1tdc1.png?width=1789&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a9f1f6898b4406d4574103d9a334bacdda48fc9\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResult: Down and then up. Wait for Feb OPEX/Vix expiration and then set the downtrend for \"Real interest rates\" shock using Vix seasonality in March. Like Druckenmiller says: What are we doing at these high PE's when 10yr is this high. (C down)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aiuab9iv1tdc1.png?width=1790&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd44f9962d97226c978cec3df79fc3a13d49a781\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) Cross border flows arbitrage\n\nNow this theory is still progress and even I don't know why it's happening. But the reality is it is happening. So we all know the world is deglobalized right now and the supply chains are being rebuilt. We also know most of the money is exiting China and going elsewhere. So where is this money going? Well, it is going back to USA coz of near shoring and then some of it is going to countries like Vietnam, Mexico, Japan and India. I personally trade all the markets globally and from what I have seen is the country India is benefitting the most out of this. I think it is the top 5 exchange in the world now.\n\nAs you study more about India you will realize that people are investing heavily into the stock market especially after 2020. There is a euphoria in India right now which even far exceeds the euphoria in US. Just look at valuation's w/o any AI company and 10yr at 7% appropriate PE is 25.\n\nIf you look deeper into flows you will find out that there is some sort of lead-lag relationship going on in the flows. Sometimes it is the Indian mkt which leads and sometimes it is US. But most of the times you will find that it is the Indian stock market that is predicting things in the future and the US stock market is lagging. You all guys were asking for a time machine in WSB. This is it. Now why is the US market lagging?\n\nSo from what I have researched so far is most of the money that goes into Indian stock mkt by its domestic population is through mutual funds but for the US it is not the mutual funds. it is the passive investment vehicles like for ex Vanguard. Now what it does is when things are predicted to go bad, mutual funds shifts allocation to more cash and therefore imo stock market of India is leading most of the times. In US the dominance in market are these passive 401k's. Hypothetically speaking, mkt won't crash big time until you or your friend (my friend lost his in dec) loses their job and that's why US markets are lagging.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExamples:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nhloppkj2tdc1.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=645e4b271ad3fca9729b006356e2e37355efd509\n\nIn the figure above I have shown the previous examples from 2021 and 2022 where the lag time was months and I know its too much of a lag for some of you and you guys don't have the patience to wait for that long therefore let's take another example from December 2023 where the lag time was reduced even further.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Wednesday VIX exp: 00:30 am](https://preview.redd.it/1nzc87yl2tdc1.png?width=1497&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0516a3f5cc179d2333c77ca5184b7c59e752bf7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Wednesday VIX exp: 13:00](https://preview.redd.it/nfe1kx8o2tdc1.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9f62c168e667d559d02043991bb5965c19017a1)\n\nLag time: 12.5hrs (NYC UTC -5 time-zone)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow you must be like \"Impossible! No one could have seen this before\"\n\nCmon guys I posted about this [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18mq7ec/mayday_mayday_mayday_liquidity_is_deteriorating/) and I even predicted (although by accident) the exact top on Nifty first time it happened and knew SPX was going to fall off the cliff in 2022 using this lead-lag relationship. Because of that 2022 letters were so good at predicting tops and bottoms coz i already knew about the downtrend. Although I was so stupid back then and didn't understand these things. But guys those things are happening again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nExperiment No 2:\n\nIf we use the above approach, then we come to a conclusion that markets will fall starting Tuesday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xflg0k7v2tdc1.png?width=1729&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e1497d5f0aadd255c9654b4b57e36adff03b9d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nResult:\n\n\\- Most of the time the relationship is the leading one and US lagging.\n\n\\- The lags can be anywhere from between a day to three or four months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrent theory suggests that US stock market will go down next week once this melt-up is over. Let's see. But hey do not try to time the exact date. I too was trying to do that this week but I missed the trade man. And boi it hurts bad. :\\_(\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo don't make the same mistakes as me. And don't get caught up in the narrative media will sell you next week. \"Flows is all that matters\" \"Narratives follows the price and not the other way around\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\np.s. I have kept one important detail out. Figure it out on your own.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Invalidation:**\n\nI forgot to mention this one in the last post but every theory must have an invalidation. I have two.\n\n\\- If Powell cuts rate in Jan Fomc then throw this analysis out of the window. It will be something different.\n\n\\- Fed sets up a BTFP permanent like facility before Minsky moment happens. Right now, they are thinking about that use of Discount window once every year by regionals allegedly. Nothing has been confirmed yet.\n\n\\- Wait maybe 3 but it has to be something with QRA. I am not an expert. Contact your financial advisor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final thoughts:**\n\nSo I was watching multiple podcasts the other day just to see what other minds are thinking. And man the bears are angry and sad coz government took their recession away. Here are some of the points they are making.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJobs report: We all know how dumb establishment survey is and how it is calculated. Just look at that spread. They do anything to make it to 100%. Ex: Okay 30% people reported surely rest 70% are doing just as fine as 30%. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ct7zci83tdc1.png?width=1399&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1b4d82d758e8d02b8fb1eb1da4970c2506956d9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGDP vs GDI both nominal and real: Basically GDP should be around 0 or 1 like Europe + UK. But hey who cares do the deficit spending and boost Real GDP even though tax receipts are falling like a rock. Add inflation and wow what a spectacular Nominal GDP and GDI we have going on. We can't even fall into recession mate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5j6x5jib3tdc1.png?width=1646&format=png&auto=webp&s=4653ee4d6d3d6e372aa7f705029e925a14252b13\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w2xwihcc3tdc1.png?width=1650&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b6bc866f92a2debd42d81e344f5883dfa91cff7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeige book & Lorie Logan: Something has spooked Powell and that's why tapering QT is being mentioned by Dallas Fed. Also what a horrible report that recent one was.\n\n[Federal Reserve Board Publication](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/BeigeBook_20240117.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r05og0bh3tdc1.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=d368c4d3c6cbf5ff629bf7832233678570a58218\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCPI Lie: Do I really have to explain that?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I know most of you guys are like \"Don't hate the players hate the game\" \"You get paid for making money in this business not waiting\" \"Stocks only go up in an election year\" What is it 16/16 it's been +ve. And then we also have the consensus \"Soft landing\" being priced into markets. But guys i am stressing this point again \"Consensus is not always right\" \"Whipsaw can occur when you least expect it\" You don't have to go back 100yrs just look at last year in bond yields, recession calls, spx price targets etc. Now I am not calling for a recession. Like I said in last newsletter I have no right to call one so I am calling for \"Great crab mkt of 1972\" till October.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut again, just be careful going into 2024. It's a leap year and just like shmita year you gotta watch out for these one's as well. And I am trying my best not to post silly stuffs. I only posted a \"MSFT vs AAPL\" chart and \"Where is the bottom in the index\". One was the video which got deleted. That's it. Rest I am posting elsewhere so don't look much into it. And hey if this all doesn't play out please criticize me all you want in the comments section. I will definitely read them and if this really happens you guys are shipping an Apple VR. God these shortages. xD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you.\n\nLove you guys, Take care.\n\nHave a great weekend.\n\nCheers..!!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRegards\n\nDesmond\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bye.

Let me give you some food for thought...\n\nThe reason I changed my mind from mid March to April is because of the Treasury actions.  Last year, the Treasury guidance stated that it would end March with a TGA balance of 500B.  However, the whole debt ceiling debacle started, and it ended March with a TGA balance of around 200B... effectively pumping 300B into the economy/markets.  That's also what broke the downward trend, and caused markets to bounce up.  That's not going to happen this year though, and the markets could easily keep going down beyond mid March.

I've been telling people that it's going to be like running out of gas while driving...\n\nSure, cars have gas gauges (just as we know how much is in RRP), but a car doesn't give much advanced warning before running out of gas.  It will be running along fine and then starts to sputter.  It won't sputter and then keep running for 5-10 min before quiting; it will sputter and then quit within the minute.\n\nThat's how I think the economy/markets will go.
