Yours may have been one that there was no interference fit, so the operator didn\u2019t need to use the soap to get the parts to fit together so they could be glued. For the ones with such a tight fit, I suspect there was more than a poor glue bond, if the plates were forced together and truly didn\u2019t fit that well, the stresses being held in check temporarily by the clamping of the fixture, would still be there when the brand new glue job, just minutes old was put immediately to the test of keeping these two surfaces together again forces of the ill fit, trying to push them back apart in the relaxed position of being separated. These ill fitting parts made for the perfect Stress and strain and glue sandwich. Most glues are great against lateral forces, and compressive forces, but when force is trying to separate the two surfaces, strain on the glue can lead to peeling, fracturing and stretching of the softer glue material until an air gap forms and the glue bond totally fails.

On US Navy Ships, such a system is used to stop rusting of steel hulls and is electrically charged to enhance the action. This method prevents the salt water from stripping away electrons from the metal being protected, instead, it attacks the sacrificial anode rod and strips it of it\u2019s electrons, eventually destroying the rod which is regularly replaced.\n\nHere is an example of the products specifically designed to protect aluminum boats.

Chrysler starting using aluminum hoods and water would collect where the under frame is crimped to the upper aluminum sheet metal in the Town & Country, Dodge Grand Caravan, and Chrysler Pacifica. Stellantis had to replace and paint new hoods for most of these minivans under their corrosion warranty, as the Bauxite Bubbled lines would appear at the lowest point on the hood, right above the grill. The reason for the problem in that case is the interaction between the Steel under frame and the Aluminum Sheet Metal formed a galvanic Cell, like a battery, where the Steel is the protected Cathode and the part you see, the aluminum, used to save weight, with the paint job on the outside, is the sacrificial Anode once salty water gets between the dissimilar metals.
