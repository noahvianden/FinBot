Tesla is not aware of every crash involving Autopilot even for severe crashes because of gaps in telematic reporting. Tesla receives telematic data from its vehicles, when appropriate cellular connectivity exists and the antenna is not damaged during a crash, that support both crash notification and aggregation of fleet vehicle mileage. Tesla largely receives data for crashes only with pyrotechnic deployment,2 which are a minority of police reported crashes.3 A review of NHTSA\u2019s 2021 FARS and Crash Report Sampling System (CRSS) finds that only 18 percent of police-reported crashes include airbag deployments.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c55 crashes were identified where Autopilot was in use, but it appeared that the driver may have inadvertently or unknowingly deactivated Autosteer while TACC remained engaged.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor 135 incidents, the driver response to a hazard prior to impact was identified through a review of the EDR and vehicle data logs. Drivers either did not brake or braked less than one second prior to the crash in 82 percent of the incidents, and either did not steer or steered less than one second prior to impact in 78 percent of the incidents.\u201d\n", "id": "1cdytrh", "created_utc": 1714171204.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.42, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "Almost all manufacturers don\u2019t know their crash rate data because they don\u2019t have any telematics that auto report.", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "Yea, I wonder why NHTSA framed the report so negatively.

NHTSA has a wide variety of ways to receive crash reports and ODI did not rely on a simplistic crash rate comparison between Tesla and its L2 peers based on report counts alone. Rather, ODI also relied on a qualitative review of the crash circumstances as reported by the Tesla systems, including such information as how long the hazard was visible, whether the crash was reasonably avoidable, and vehicle/driver performance.\n\nThis sounds like Tesla would be over-reporting crashes compared to its peers because it doesn\u2019t rely on a person to manually report a crash, but instead does it automatically through telemetry.

To ensure our statistics are conservative, we count any crash in which Autopilot was deactivated within 5 seconds before impact, and we count all crashes in which the incident alert indicated an airbag or other active restraint deployed.

In practice, this correlates to nearly any crash at about 12 mph (20 kph) or above, depending on the crash forces generated.*\u00a0\n\nI dug into this a while back so I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but as I recall, other OEMs (not every one, but predominantly) use a sampling system based on surveying a number of municipalities and tracking every vehicle with a police report.

{"title": "For you weak paperhands, who actually managed to lose money this week, CPNG may be your last chance", "selftext": "So after 6 straight days of red, and caving into your FOMO self, you chose **this** week to be a bear?\n\nLook, I know all you downy looking regards are very talented at losing money,  but if you want to actually try **making** some money for once, I\u2019ll let you in on some of my cooking \ud83c\udf73\n\nOkay great, the reason for the post today, is that something **just** came across my desk and it is perhaps the **best** thing I've seen in six months.\n\nFor all you uneducated burger flippers, let me tell you about CPNG (Coupang) a growing Korean e-commerce company. After taking a look at the charts on my robinhood app, I could tell that this stock has **HUGE** upside potential with **very little** downside. Their earnings are on **May 7th** and it could easily be one of those rare 1**0 baggers** we get every so often. \ud83d\udcb0x10\n\nThe fair value for CPNG is estimated at $32.41 based on the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Meanwhile, it's trading at a measly $22.91. That means this stock is undervalued by a staggering 30% meaning it can moon, HARD. \ud83c\udf15 \ud83d\ude80\n\nFor the intellectually challenged among you, let me explain the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to explain why I think this is. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca1\n\nLet\u2019s Project CPNG's future free cash flows (FCF) for the next 10 years:\n\nI\u2019m not going to explain how inflation works to you poors, but generally, money is more valuable today than in ten years. Bottom line, you discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7wdna9rphwwc1.png?width=2636&format=png&auto=webp&s=73befba8f4425a925cad0208c5fd71579c707c20\n\n**Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)** = US$18b\n\nNext is what you call Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. Now discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.\n\n\\*\\*Terminal Value (TV)\\*\\*= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$3.7b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (7.1%\u2013 2.3%) = US$79b\n\n\\*\\*Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)\\*\\*= TV / (1 + r)10= US$79b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$40b\n\nCrunch the numbers and add up all the present values of CPNG's future cash flows, which gives us a total equity value of $58 billion\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\n\nNow, here's where it gets juicy. Take that $58 billion and divide it by the number of shares outstanding and you will get $32.41.\n\nCompared to the current share price of $22.91, and you'll realize this stock is undervalued by a whole 30%! \ud83d\udcc8\n\nNow, I know some of you are probably trembling in your Crocs, afraid to take the plunge. But **guess what**, betas don\u2019t make money, they just choose a nice ETF like VOO after paperhanding on options **once**.\n\nSo, here's the deal. CPNG is practically begging you to buy it at this massive discount. Don't be a wimp, grab some calls and strap in, because this rocket is about to blast off to the moon, and leave you whining about how you can't achieve generational wealth.\n\nTLDR; CPNG is undervalued by 30%, you neckbeards. If you don't go all-in right now, you'll be stuck working at Wendy\u2019s while the rest of us count our tendies \ud83d\udcb0\ud83c\udf5f\n\nPositions: 10 x 28c 6/21 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcb0\n\n\\*Not financial advice, do your own research before investing, I may have an extra chromosome", "id": "1cdyxbo", "created_utc": 1714171472.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 month ago\n**Total Comments** | 23 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cdyxbo/for_you_weak_paperhands_who_actually_managed_to/) \n**Account Age** | 9 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.38051149249076843}, {"body": "After all that bullshit why only 10 sissy ass contracts?? $200 bucks\u2026..really?", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "Cant wait to meet up OP behind Wendy's I will give him another $5 to add to his wallet.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06800435483455658}, {"body": "Starter position regard", "score": -43, "replies": [{"body": "In the time it spent you to write all that, I already made $200 while taking a dump on company time.", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "PTP is the best.

{"title": "For you weak paperhands, who actually managed to lose money this week, CPNG may be your last chance", "selftext": "So after 6 straight days of red, and caving into your FOMO self, you chose **this** week to be a bear?\n\nLook, I know all you downy looking regards are very talented at losing money,  but if you want to actually try **making** some money for once, I\u2019ll let you in on some of my cooking \ud83c\udf73\n\nOkay great, the reason for the post today, is that something **just** came across my desk and it is perhaps the **best** thing I've seen in six months.\n\nFor all you uneducated burger flippers, let me tell you about CPNG (Coupang) a growing Korean e-commerce company. After taking a look at the charts on my robinhood app, I could tell that this stock has **HUGE** upside potential with **very little** downside. Their earnings are on **May 7th** and it could easily be one of those rare 1**0 baggers** we get every so often. \ud83d\udcb0x10\n\nThe fair value for CPNG is estimated at $32.41 based on the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Meanwhile, it's trading at a measly $22.91. That means this stock is undervalued by a staggering 30% meaning it can moon, HARD. \ud83c\udf15 \ud83d\ude80\n\nFor the intellectually challenged among you, let me explain the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to explain why I think this is. \ud83e\udde0\ud83d\udca1\n\nLet\u2019s Project CPNG's future free cash flows (FCF) for the next 10 years:\n\nI\u2019m not going to explain how inflation works to you poors, but generally, money is more valuable today than in ten years. Bottom line, you discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7wdna9rphwwc1.png?width=2636&format=png&auto=webp&s=73befba8f4425a925cad0208c5fd71579c707c20\n\n**Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)** = US$18b\n\nNext is what you call Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. Now discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.\n\n\\*\\*Terminal Value (TV)\\*\\*= FCF2033 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$3.7b\u00d7 (1 + 2.3%) \u00f7 (7.1%\u2013 2.3%) = US$79b\n\n\\*\\*Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)\\*\\*= TV / (1 + r)10= US$79b\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$40b\n\nCrunch the numbers and add up all the present values of CPNG's future cash flows, which gives us a total equity value of $58 billion\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\udcb0\n\nNow, here's where it gets juicy. Take that $58 billion and divide it by the number of shares outstanding and you will get $32.41.\n\nCompared to the current share price of $22.91, and you'll realize this stock is undervalued by a whole 30%! \ud83d\udcc8\n\nNow, I know some of you are probably trembling in your Crocs, afraid to take the plunge. But **guess what**, betas don\u2019t make money, they just choose a nice ETF like VOO after paperhanding on options **once**.\n\nSo, here's the deal. CPNG is practically begging you to buy it at this massive discount. Don't be a wimp, grab some calls and strap in, because this rocket is about to blast off to the moon, and leave you whining about how you can't achieve generational wealth.\n\nTLDR; CPNG is undervalued by 30%, you neckbeards. If you don't go all-in right now, you'll be stuck working at Wendy\u2019s while the rest of us count our tendies \ud83d\udcb0\ud83c\udf5f\n\nPositions: 10 x 28c 6/21 \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\udcb0\n\n\\*Not financial advice, do your own research before investing, I may have an extra chromosome", "id": "1cdyxbo", "created_utc": 1714171472.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 month ago\n**Total Comments** | 23 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cdyxbo/for_you_weak_paperhands_who_actually_managed_to/) \n**Account Age** | 9 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.38051149249076843}, {"body": "After all that bullshit why only 10 sissy ass contracts?? $200 bucks\u2026..really?", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "Cant wait to meet up OP behind Wendy's I will give him another $5 to add to his wallet.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06800435483455658}, {"body": "Starter position regard", "score": -43, "replies": [{"body": "In the time it spent you to write all that, I already made $200 while taking a dump on company time.", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "PTP is the best.
