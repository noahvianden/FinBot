{"title": "Between Two Growth Curves: What should investors do?", "selftext": "\\# Listening to Q4 earnings call, I initially understood two growth curves to mean: \n\n* **OLD GROWTH**: Model SEXY\n* **NEW GROWTH:** ramping Cybertruck and starting Model 2.\n\n\\# However, *reading between the lines of what Elon has been saying*, I get the sense that it's ACTUALLY:\n\n* **OLD GROWTH**: making driver-led EV's (and energy)\n* **NEW GROWTH**: autonomous EV's and humanoid robots\n\n\\# Initial thesis for driver-led EV was:\n\n* **BEFORE**: It's like flip phones to iphones. Starts small, then takes over. 50% cagr. Cost will dramatically come down. Battery will dramatically improve. ICE extinct.\n* **FOR NOW**: macro/ interest rate/ pandemic playing a role for sure, and cost has improved, but still cost and battery have not improved dramatically *yet*. Not only not 50% cagr, but '24 Q1 delivery was actually less than '23 (yes there were terrorists/pirates to deal with, but there is definitely *some* demand issue).\n\n\\# The current thesis for autonomous EV's and humanoid robots, as I understand it:\n\n* **Gigantic TAM:** Totally revolutionize mode of travel with robotaxi, and revolutionize human labor with optimus. Led by best talent/ management in Tesla and Elon who has done the impossible before. Instead of simply thinking in terms of how to sell more EV's to make profit, he seem to be thinking first principle in terms of just fixing mode of travel broadly instead, and same with human labor. The AI/ compute era coming online is a big tailwind as well. *It's very compelling*.\n* **BUT**: Youtube influencers \\*love\\* to say *\"Wallstreet people this, wallstreet people that.\"* But bottom line is, as it pertains to robotaxi and optimus, it's a **pre-revenue, pre-product start-up businesses**. No idea if/ when/ and how much this business will actually turn in to. It's a tough call not just for wallstreet people, but for any investor.\n\n\\# What to do as an investor:\n\n* **On one hand**, I think this equation generally works: (conviction) \\* (portfolio weight) < (desire to buy the dip). Meaning we should assign portfolio weight in such a way that we are still happy to buy the dip and sleep soundly.\n* **Why not just wait**: for some more data about robotaxi and optimus to surface before betting the farm. *It could be 3-5 years or longer for all we know, and that could be years of side-ways action for the stock*. If Tesla is going to solve all the problems, then even if I heavily buy the stock later at the first sign of real product, shouldn't I easily make good money on the investment, but in a safe way?\n* **The FOMO**: have you read Peter Diamandis' \"Future is Closer than You Think?\" *Technology is going at an exponential pace now, and all these things will be done way faster than you think- think like 1-2 years*! But also, you see this is a generational opportunity. Don't want to just make good money. I want to make retire-tomorrow money, and *betting on Elon now is the ticket*. If I wait until there's obvious sign, then the stock price will have run up so much by then and *I will have missed out*.\n\n\\# What I did:\n\n* After the delivery announcement, before the 8/8 announcement, I decreased my portfolio weight of Tesla from 40% to 30%, as I felt afterwards that I would feel much happier about stock price going down and would happily buy more. Plus, even at 30%, if Tesla is going to moon, I think I will be plenty fine. **But looks like because I sold, I called bottom; you're welcome**.\n\nX: eyedoctorjae", "id": "1bxvko3", "created_utc": 1712464165.0, "score": 27, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 44, "comments": [{"body": "I don't get the \"trader\" mindset.\n\nWe'll never be quicker or more clever that the algo-bots.
