Yes, the weekly premium was a little low this week. The PUTs were lower this week to due to an overall rise on my positions. PUTs were easier to sell in the last 4 weeks prior to this last week due to a short term downtrend in the market. Another major factor was that it was earnings week and I was cautious with my positions, with the exception of INTC and SNAP. Those earnings plays turned out well for me.   \n  \nAMZN reports next week (4/30 after-hours), so I ended up buying back my covered call for them. I'll wait for their earnings to sell another covered call on them. Same with HOOD, they report on 5/8 in two weeks. With their push for retirement dollars through 4/30, I feel like they will beat, so I don't want too many covered calls out on them when that happens. Some of the others I was not able to sell covered calls on were: BIDU, UPST, NTLA, CRSP, TWLO, and TLRY. So, throw a few more PUTs in and some of the other weekly positions and it was a normal week. I can't predict next week, but I do think it was a little lower than it should have been. \n\nCongrats on the positive net premiums! I also like how you converting your options to low deltas/more DTEs. It's smart to adjust things gradually. Is it possible for you to go from margin to cash?

The first is that I was not selling options from 2015-2021, I was building a dividend portfolio. I was introduced to options in 2021. It was a slow steady approach that got to about $200 per month in dividends.   \n  \nI started in January 2021 only selling covered calls. Because I was green and learning, I fell into the premium chasing trap. This can only be described as short term thinking that ultimately led to bag holding companies that had short runs followed by significant downturns.   \n  \n2022 I incorporated PUT selling. I had many lessons learned from selling covered calls and was ready to expand the options repertoire. I also experimented with closing out positions at various percentages. Now, I buy back or close out positions sparingly. With this experience, I knew I wanted to be on the selling/writing side of the equation. 2022 was not a good year for the market in general. This ended up being a blessing in disguise as I discovered and incorporated LEAPS toward the end of the year.   \n  \n2023 I felt like I was putting it all together. The timing was good because almost everyone had a great 2023, so I took advantage of this good period by honing the option selling skills.  \n\nIf you made it this far, I am finally answering your questions: Since I have only been using this overall strategy since 2023. I will provide the equity curve since then. In 2023 the overall value of my account, including of my initial capital, profits and losses from options trades, and cash secured from selling options was $65,403 or a 41.31% increase. The largest peak-to-trough decline my account has experienced was a peak of $240k in July 2021. This dropped to $141k in January of 2023. More caveats: because of this draw down, I have made better decisions on the companies I own and the options I sell.  \n  \n2024 YTD I peaked at $220k in march. I am down $2,436 or 1.17%. The low point was $193k back in January.   \n  \nHope I was able to shed some light on your questions. If I missed anything, please let me know. \n\nBest of luck to you in your investing journey.

With thetaing, you're essentially profiting off of high IV and theta decay, but if there's a swift move against your trade, it could feel nerve wecking and disheartening to see your premium go to negative.\n\nI been assigned when the trader on the other end exercised their options too early (i.e., before their expiration date). Then, I'm forced to exercise my long leg bc my account can't take assignments most of the time. The spread you create limits your max loss. So if my spread was $5 wide, then the most I could lose is $500 if I exercise my long leg. The problem is that my broker also charges me margin interest fees for 4 days on assignment amount even if I exercise my long leg on the morning of my assignment. So sometimes I could end up paying an additional $100~$300 PER assignment bc 4 days of the margin interest could add up to that, depending on your strike.\n\nAlso if I don't close my weekly spreads on Friday before the closing bell and one of my strike ends up being ITM, then I'll be assigned. That has happened to me before bc my sleeping schedule was off \ud83d\ude05\n\nIf you have a big enough account and can take the assignment, you can always sell cover calls on them to soften the margin interest fees (if you're paying them to borrow the money to take the assignment) or even make more money depending how the market moves.\n\nThe net value of all the premium I collected this week added up to $1,300 for me. I'm not sure why it looks different for others.

Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).\n\nThis is what a great post looks like:\n\n[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!\n\nHere are examples of what could get your post removed:\n\n* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help.
