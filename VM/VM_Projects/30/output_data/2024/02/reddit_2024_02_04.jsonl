It seems like you've caught onto that. You lose your deltas when the position goes in your favor. You'd have to trade very aggressively to participate in an upmove like we've seen over the last few months.\n\nSelling premium is really an expression of short volatility, because you'll only have a positive expected return, if volatility is overpriced. This is true for directional traders as well.\n\nI've commented on this before, but this has been a particularly bad time for neutral trading. Its not the fact that we're in a bull market, or that volatility is low, although, those are significant factors. Its because we're in a melt up. Its the worst I can recall since the spring of 2020. The market rips higher almost every day, like a commodity facing a global shortage.\n\nThis is extremely abnormal. You could have bought the 45 DTE straddle every day since Nov 1 and you'd be up with an 88% win rate. Under normal circumstances, that strategy would be at a 100% loss within a few months.\n\nThat said, these periods never last very long. I suspect we are at the tail end of this, although I could be wrong! If you look at what the individual stocks are doing, its really just the \"mag 7,\" that are driving the rally. The equal weight S&P and small caps are down or flat. Small caps are still in a bear market.\n\nIts funny to see people say things like, \"sell puts, cause we're in a bull market.\" No one who's ever traded through a bear market would say something like this.

The market will be comparatively strong, but the indices will drift lower as tech drags them down. Could happen in a month or 5 years, but it will happen.\n\nSomething to consider also is, the first year of the bull market that started in 2022 was one of the weakest in history, barely making 10% off the bottom.

I use their most popular called High Options Volume (basically companies that have weekly options, you\u2019ll identify them because they have more than 2 near-term expirations) and sort the watchlist by IVx%% which is just an easy way to identify high IV stocks. That is not all though. Using Tradingview or Seeking Alpha (my preferred websites, their offerings aren\u2019t unique so it\u2019s ok to use what you prefer) I look for companies that are profitable by looking at their statements and balance sheet, but for convenience you can just check if the company has an EPS number (nothing == negative earnings)\nI also prefer trading stocks that cost around 50-150 USD, because their option pricing takes into account option greeks, because they give edge to option sellers and negatively impact buyers. Stocks that are too cheap give almost no room for the extrinsic value of the option to materialize using the different components that establish the bid/ask prices. Going higher than 400 USD for an underlying is fine, but it\u2019s a bit rich for my blood, because I regularly double-down on positions while rolling and you can\u2019t do that more than a few times before it outsizes my portfolio. \n\nI hope your biggest takeaway here is\n1.

The fewer days there are, the strongest gamma is to help buyers make money even if most of the time value and volatility is gone. Holding options to expiration is a dumb risk when you are a seller.\n\nTheta is weakest the more time you have to expiration, selling 100 days out or 300 days out virtually has the same theta dacay and it is a waste of capital. About 60-30 days is the sweet spot when theta accelerates and chips off the biggest chunks of the extrinsic value of an option. You can be greedy with theta. I usually roll options when I have about 16-17 days to expiration (Tuesday/Wednesday 2 weeks before expiration) \nTastytrade swear by rolling or closing 3 weeks before expiration(21 days to expiration at the latest) \n\n\nVega is the IV component which spikes and plunges for a singular reason, but very complicated on how it all comes together: \n- There is a ton of volume and open interest in a specific expiration: that can be because people speculate on an event like a company presentation or earnings date or something more obscure like licensing contract ending, share lockup period ends after IPO, it can be earnings or whatever the end result is that there is a lot more open interest in a given expiration. \nWhat you may not have guessed is that the market maker balancing the options chain by trading contracts through algorithms buy and sell the underlying in an effort to offset what the options market is doing and that \u201chedging\u201d the MMs are doing puts premium into very OTM options that increase vega for them, hence you see junk options with extrinsic value on them -> that is almost 90% vega and the rest is theta.\n\nThe cool hidden benefit of vega is that you can see in real time what the market thinks about the underlying for that specific time period. Market participant actions accumulate and create a skew on either the puts or the calls side. Call skew means that calls are more expensive compared to equidistant puts when using ATM as base. That easily means the market sees more upside risk or the market thinks the stock will go up by that expiration (not guaranteed it won\u2019t come sooner or later than the expiration you are analyzing). Theta gang dictates we sell calls to speculators, because premiums on the call side are higher, so you get an edge by going further out of the money (13 delta call and 13 delta put aren\u2019t equidistant when you have skew and skew naturally forms as market participants take positions and the market maker takes positions to offset the customer) \n\nAs I wrote to OP in my original comment I play both sides and sell strangles and straddles so I don\u2019t really care about skew, but I try to stay delta neutral, so I sell equal delta options on both sides or in cases when the skew is really noticeable at least if there is call skew I sell more aggressive puts to gain more premium than I would have staying neutral.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5765694379806519}, {"body": ">Look for stocks that have IV Rank above 40 or stocks with IV index (or percentile) above 60%.\n\nsorry for the potentially dumbass question but what platform are you using to screen for this?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hey, there are no stupid questions!

It seems like you've caught onto that. You lose your deltas when the position goes in your favor. You'd have to trade very aggressively to participate in an upmove like we've seen over the last few months.\n\nSelling premium is really an expression of short volatility, because you'll only have a positive expected return, if volatility is overpriced. This is true for directional traders as well.\n\nI've commented on this before, but this has been a particularly bad time for neutral trading. Its not the fact that we're in a bull market, or that volatility is low, although, those are significant factors. Its because we're in a melt up. Its the worst I can recall since the spring of 2020. The market rips higher almost every day, like a commodity facing a global shortage.\n\nThis is extremely abnormal.

Under normal circumstances, that strategy would be at a 100% loss within a few months.\n\nThat said, these periods never last very long. I suspect we are at the tail end of this, although I could be wrong! If you look at what the individual stocks are doing, its really just the \"mag 7,\" that are driving the rally. The equal weight S&P and small caps are down or flat. Small caps are still in a bear market.\n\nIts funny to see people say things like, \"sell puts, cause we're in a bull market.\" No one who's ever traded through a bear market would say something like this.

I personally stay away from stocks that cost less than $10-15, because the premiums there are shit. I was trading through tastytrade and they have preset watchlists. I use their most popular called High Options Volume (basically companies that have weekly options, you\u2019ll identify them because they have more than 2 near-term expirations) and sort the watchlist by IVx%% which is just an easy way to identify high IV stocks. That is not all though. Using Tradingview or Seeking Alpha (my preferred websites, their offerings aren\u2019t unique so it\u2019s ok to use what you prefer) I look for companies that are profitable by looking at their statements and balance sheet, but for convenience you can just check if the company has an EPS number (nothing == negative earnings)\nI also prefer trading stocks that cost around 50-150 USD, because their option pricing takes into account option greeks, because they give edge to option sellers and negatively impact buyers. Stocks that are too cheap give almost no room for the extrinsic value of the option to materialize using the different components that establish the bid/ask prices. Going higher than 400 USD for an underlying is fine, but it\u2019s a bit rich for my blood, because I regularly double-down on positions while rolling and you can\u2019t do that more than a few times before it outsizes my portfolio. \n\nI hope your biggest takeaway here is\n1.

The fewer days there are, the strongest gamma is to help buyers make money even if most of the time value and volatility is gone. Holding options to expiration is a dumb risk when you are a seller.\n\nTheta is weakest the more time you have to expiration, selling 100 days out or 300 days out virtually has the same theta dacay and it is a waste of capital. About 60-30 days is the sweet spot when theta accelerates and chips off the biggest chunks of the extrinsic value of an option. You can be greedy with theta. I usually roll options when I have about 16-17 days to expiration (Tuesday/Wednesday 2 weeks before expiration) \nTastytrade swear by rolling or closing 3 weeks before expiration(21 days to expiration at the latest) \n\n\nVega is the IV component which spikes and plunges for a singular reason, but very complicated on how it all comes together: \n- There is a ton of volume and open interest in a specific expiration: that can be because people speculate on an event like a company presentation or earnings date or something more obscure like licensing contract ending, share lockup period ends after IPO, it can be earnings or whatever the end result is that there is a lot more open interest in a given expiration. \nWhat you may not have guessed is that the market maker balancing the options chain by trading contracts through algorithms buy and sell the underlying in an effort to offset what the options market is doing and that \u201chedging\u201d the MMs are doing puts premium into very OTM options that increase vega for them, hence you see junk options with extrinsic value on them -> that is almost 90% vega and the rest is theta.\n\nThe cool hidden benefit of vega is that you can see in real time what the market thinks about the underlying for that specific time period. Market participant actions accumulate and create a skew on either the puts or the calls side. Call skew means that calls are more expensive compared to equidistant puts when using ATM as base. That easily means the market sees more upside risk or the market thinks the stock will go up by that expiration (not guaranteed it won\u2019t come sooner or later than the expiration you are analyzing). Theta gang dictates we sell calls to speculators, because premiums on the call side are higher, so you get an edge by going further out of the money (13 delta call and 13 delta put aren\u2019t equidistant when you have skew and skew naturally forms as market participants take positions and the market maker takes positions to offset the customer) \n\nAs I wrote to OP in my original comment I play both sides and sell strangles and straddles so I don\u2019t really care about skew, but I try to stay delta neutral, so I sell equal delta options on both sides or in cases when the skew is really noticeable at least if there is call skew I sell more aggressive puts to gain more premium than I would have staying neutral.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5765694379806519}, {"body": ">Look for stocks that have IV Rank above 40 or stocks with IV index (or percentile) above 60%.\n\nsorry for the potentially dumbass question but what platform are you using to screen for this?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Hey, there are no stupid questions!
