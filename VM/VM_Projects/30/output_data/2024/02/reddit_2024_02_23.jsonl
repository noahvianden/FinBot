You need to combine money odds and winning odd to find the overall odds of profitability. So if the money odd is 25% then you want the delta odds in your favor. So if delta is an average of 17 in your example the overall odds are in your favor. Typically the trades I enter in are 2-1 money odds against me but the delta odds (winning odds) are 80% in my favor. For instance if I can make $130 or lose $370 then if I win 4 out of five times then my profits are 4x 130 =$520 and the loss is $370 so overall it\u2019s beneficial. Obviously not all spreads work this way and it takes time to find ones that make sense. Also if a trade is losing you can roll it up or out to try to avoid steep loses. Also I try to find charts that are mildly bullish so there is directional bias because a short put vertical is a bullish trade.
