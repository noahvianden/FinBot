That is it control is something people think they have even when they really don't. I understand putting everything on black at the roulette wheel is gambling or yolo everything on buying ODTE  puts or calls is gambling but equally it can still be a strategy.... maybe its a bad strategy or excessive risk, etc... especially when you lose but the more I look at it, I just see risk and a lack of genuine control exists in many activities and occupations that people don't think of it as gambling but in many ways it is.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Risk exists on a continuim.
