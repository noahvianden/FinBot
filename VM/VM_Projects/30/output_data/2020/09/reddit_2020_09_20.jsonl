We'll fucking buy the stock market, thats right, buy the fucking global stock market, because that's how fucking bomb ass rich we will be. We'll buy a couple jumbo jets to take you fuckers to the U.A.E. and see who can hook up with the most hookers while simultaneously injecting liquid chicken tenders into our fucking arm.\n\nWhat do you say, retards.
