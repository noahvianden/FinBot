I was borrow my friends fiat 500e and was pretty impressed. Used they were under $10,000 for like 15,000 miles. Big problem is they have like 80 miles of range and are super tiny. So I was looking at VW and their eGolf. Problem with that was everything before 2017 had the same battery size as the fiat. So I was looking at the 2017 and newer models, but those were around $20,000 give or take a few thousand and we\u2019re only rated around 130 miles which wasn\u2019t much better. \n\nI\u2019m currently sitting in my $35,000 Model 3 at a super charger adding about 200 miles of range in like 30 minutes. I\u2019d be here for hours with any other car. \n\nNo other EVs come close to this. Once Tesla release a compact car to compete with the VW $20,000 range, they will slaughter every other car maker out there. \n\nThen there\u2019s also the cyber truck, and maybe some sort of van?

We're waiting for those demonic criminals to get back from summer vacation (imagine that)...\n\nThe dollar has had a bit of a bounce but is clearly in a brain dead down channel. You can look at my chart here for proof: [https://imgur.com/BOSazKL](https://imgur.com/BOSazKL)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why is it going to go back down after it hits resistance?** Bc they fucking told us so. Jerome literally promised from Jackson Hole and Donnie been trying to kick it in the teeth for years so that the US can be more competitive with manufacturing. Here, I added more things to the chart to show you NEET's: [https://imgur.com/RQAsvKh](https://imgur.com/RQAsvKh)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How can we trust Congress to do something?**\n\n*We actually can't...can you believe that's the biggest risk?* People are rioting in the streets when they should be rioting in the halls of congress - but that's neither here nor there (*I swear if this is considered political bullshit then we are fucked and wont be able to discuss fiscal at all on here*). These political apes need to do something to save middle and lower class America. 70% of NYC restaurants are said be go out of biz by March 2021...and we're not even talking about the real estate market yet. These cucks need to start helicoptering money ASAP and that ought to be the catalyst that gives Jerome what he wants - *a weaker dollar!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SO WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?**\n\n**Buy metals here retard**...\n\nLiterally it's so fucking obvious.\n\nIf you don't get it then literally fuck off and buy a TSLA stock split and then get liq'd you poor idiot. Here is a chart showing the inverse correlation between gold and DXY: [https://imgur.com/81XZlPu](https://imgur.com/81XZlPu) \n\nThe entire trade is based on real rates which is (imo) a bullshit thing to begin with bc one of the inputs is inflation and the inflation measure that is widely depended on (TIPS) is literally voodoo magic with even worse inputs than CPI - but thats neither here nor there.\n\n*So how do you get rich*...just follow DXY and punt metals. It's so easy. Btw...there are alternative currencies which are even higher beta to gold and silver - you'll need to figure out what they are for yourself. Hint: they are digitally native.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Good luck you fucks - I look forward to someone trying to prove me wrong!

Its been a week since I started. Nothing too risky tbh, but I got lucky on some news w/ Pelaton last Thursday & Draft Kings today. Turned what maybe wouldve been $400-$500 to $3.5k. Just wanted to share the tendies, and a backstory if you're into that stuff.\n\nAlways been into stocks, mostly paper trading since HS, and once I had money I never gave options a try because I never had THAT much money. I have a better job now and in May I had about $2.5k to throw in and told myself I wanted to double my portfolio by the end of the summer so I could propose to my girlfriend (really happy about this btw). It was going well, made like $700 in the first month, which is kind of easy considering the Market, but then I made a risky play I couldn't get out of (stupid, I know), and I lost almost all of my gains. Rinse and repeat and I was back at like $2400 mid July. Bought some SPXS (for why?) and held that as my only stock until I woke up out of the depressive trance in August and came back. After a few weeks of trading, my older brother made $400 off Apple one day on a single option and I couldn't help but be enticed. I'm pretty confident in my fundamentals. So I started last week Wednesday, and now I'm proposing to my girlfriend over candlelight and a chicken tendie dinner!!
