If you know anything past kindergarten math, it means options are more expensive, especially puts since that is the direction of the huge move today. What did we learn in stonk school? Buy low sell high. What am I suggesting we could be doing here? Both. Sell puts on high implied volatility and time value, and set a level to buy low. Short Vega, positive theta, long stonks. Implied volatility is mean reverting (HV 30 at 155), Father Time always wins, and stonks only go up. \n\nTake a look at the chain. You can sell 10/2 puts at 20 for $155 with only $2,000 of collateral. Look up and down the chain, and there are plenty of different plays here. That\u2019s almost 8% in 11 days. For this to fuck you, NKLA has to drop 25% in 11 days. Is it 300% you think you could get playing the Tesla battery day hype? No, but let\u2019s be real, you\u2019re going to find a way to fuck up that trade anyways and play the what if game, while jerking off to the 5 members of this sub who actually happen to get it right. This trade carries the risk of assignment and losing all of the principal, but this is a cheap enough stock and I know more people have $1,845 ($2,000-$155) they are willing to risk in the quest for learning the ways of the tard. Why not do it on a play with a 90% probability of success?\n\nThis is still wsb level autism let\u2019s be clear. Nikola probably is a bullshit company and might implode at some point. That being said, I don\u2019t think GM would just throw money into something that had completely zero value. I\u2019m sure they did due diligence, and the preorders they have for their trucks are real orders. The short seller calling them fraudulent has his own obvious interests and is looking to scare out the weak hands for a quick buck. We know this shit will probably have some crazy positive and negative days ahead regardless. All I\u2019m saying is, you can make exciting plays, while actually having some options mechanics working in your favor like volatility reversion and theta decay. This should be a moment celebrated by the autismos but I\u2019m seeing more comments being scared off by the volatility and Trevor Milton stepping down. Hopefully someone will have taken away something from this. \n\nTldr- sell NKLA 10/2 20P", "id": "ix763q", "created_utc": 1600715841.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.44, "num_comments": 40, "comments": [{"body": "I like the post, and the third paragraph is fire; however I need to reiterate that GM has just about zero risk in their deal.

I believe that Milton probably doesn\u2019t have the answers to all of the questions, but he is legitimately trying to make a product even if a lot of it is marketing hype right now.
