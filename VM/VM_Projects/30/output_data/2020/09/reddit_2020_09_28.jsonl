{"title": "Federal judge postpones Trump ban on popular app TikTok", "selftext": "The ruling followed an emergency hearing Sunday morning in which lawyers for TikTok argued that the administration\u2019s app-store ban would infringe on the company\u2019s First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business.\n\nEarlier this year, President Donald Trump declared that TikTok was a threat to national security and that it must either sell its U.S. operations to U.S. companies or be barred from the country.\n\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lawyers for TikTok pleaded with a U.S. federal judge on Sunday to delay the Trump Administration\u2019s ban of the popular video sharing program from app stores set to take effect at the end of the day, arguing the move would infringe on First Amendment rights and do irreparable harm to the business.\n\nThe 90-minute hearing came after President Donald Trump declared this summer that TikTok was a threat to national security and that it either sold its U.S. operations to U.S. companies or the app would be barred from the country.\n\nTikTok, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, is scrambling to firm up a deal tentatively struck a week ago in which it would partner with tech company Oracle and retailer Walmart and that would get the blessing of the Chinese and American governments. In the meantime, it is fighting to keep the app available in the U.S.\n\nThe ban on new downloads of TikTok, which has about 100 million users in the U.S, was delayed once by the government. A more comprehensive ban is scheduled for November, about a week after the presidential election. Judge Carl Nichols of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said he would make a decision by late Sunday, leaving TikTok\u2019s fate hanging.\n\nIn arguments to Judge Nichols, TikTok lawyer John Hall said that TikTok is more than an app but rather is a \u201cmodern day version of a town square.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf that prohibition goes into effect at midnight, the consequences immediately are grave,\u2019\u201d Hall said. \u201cIt would be no different than the government locking the doors to a public forum, roping off that town square\u201d at a time when a free exchange of ideas is necessary heading into a polarized election.\n\nHall called the ban \u201cpunitive,\u201d noting that this is \u201cjust a blunt way to whack the company now while doing nothing to achieve the stated objective of the prohibition. \u201c\n\nTikTok lawyers also argued that a ban on the app would stop tens of thousands of potential viewers and content creators every month and would also hurt its ability to hire new talent. In addition, Hall argued that a ban would prevent existing users from automatically receiving security updates, eroding national security.\n\n\u201cThis is the most immediate national security threat,\u201d argued Schwei. \u201cIt is a threat today. It is a risk today and therefore it deserves to be addressed today even while other things are ongoing and playing out.\u201d\n\nSchwei also argued that TikTok lawyers failed to prove it would suffer irreparable business harm.\n\nTrump set the process in motion with executive orders in August that declared TikTok and another Chinese app, WeChat, as threats to national security. The White House says the video service is a security risk because the personal information of its millions of U.S. users could be handed over to Chinese authorities.\n\nTrump has said he would approve a proposed deal in which Oracle and Walmart could initially own a combined 20% of a new U.S. entity, TikTok Global. Trump also said he could retract his approval if Oracle doesn\u2019t have \u201ctotal control.\u201d\n\nThe two sides of the TikTok deal have also appeared at odds over the corporate structure of TikTok Global. ByteDance said last week that it will still own 80% of the U.S. entity after a financing round. Oracle, meanwhile, put out a statement saying that Americans \u201cwill be the majority and ByteDance will have no ownership in TikTok Global.\u201d\n\nChinese media have criticized the deal as bullying and extortion, suggesting that the Chinese government is not happy with the arrangement. ByteDance said Thursday it has applied for a Chinese technology export license after Beijing tightened control over exports last month in an effort to gain leverage over Washington\u2019s attempt to force an outright sale of TikTok to U.S. owners.\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/archive-donald-trump-ad614fb615efe904057a1911985bb108?utm_medium=AP&utm_campaign=SocialFlow&utm_source=Twitter", "id": "j12giu", "created_utc": 1601254414.0, "score": 92, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "Honestly who really cares anymore.
