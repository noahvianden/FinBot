This year\u2019s event should be no different as analysts and tech journalists offer their speculation on what we should expect from the tech giant. Most expect to see the reveal of the new iPhone 12, which many believe will be Apple\u2019s first 5G product. Others are hoping for Apple to reveal a new generation of AirPods, under the name AirPod studio offering studio quality sound. Fortunately for us the guessing game has come to an end. Tim Apple himself, Apple\u2019s big boss man and playboy has come forward with some exciting news about tomorrow\u2019s event. Tomorrow on 9/15/20 Apple will release its newest phone, the iPhone 12, but perhaps even more exciting, they will be releasing their newest accessory  \u201cApple Scuba\u201d. Apple Scuba is a new function on the next generation iPhone series that allows users to breathe underwater via a breathing apparatus that can be plugged into the phone\u2019s charging port. Users simply plug in the new accessory, open the Apple Scuba app, put their mouth on the mouth piece and click the lock button for fresh Apple oxygen. Tim Apple believes this will allow users to seamless travel underwater like never before possible and states \u201cI wanted users to experience underwater travel like never before possible\u201d. This is definitely going to set Apple apart from its competitors and help people that want to breathe underwater breathe underwater.", "id": "ism6b9", "created_utc": 1600094575.0, "score": 69, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "Is this the same as microwave fast charging that exists currently?", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "I couldn't imagine a world where I couldn't pop my iPhone in the microwave for a minute and have a fully charged phone.", "score": 20, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5524164438247681}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09804438799619675}, {"body": "Actually got me excited about an apple dive watch", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "kevin oleary would loose his shit.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "It\u2019s been loost", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "My shirt is too tight it's not lose.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16802716255187988}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.026380904018878937}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0049422867596149445}, {"body": "Garmin puts then, right?", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16060082614421844}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I remember when they pushed out the software update to make my iphone 5s waterproof!", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46925729513168335}, {"body": "This is great.
