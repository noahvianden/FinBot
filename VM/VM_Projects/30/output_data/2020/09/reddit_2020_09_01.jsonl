{"title": "Idea: Poor Man's Covered Call on INTC", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.tradingview.com\\/chart\\/INTC\\/SssvzRTE-Options-Idea-Buy-The-Jan-21-2022-INTC-40-0-Call-13-90\\/](https://preview.redd.it/zafjaiy26kk51.png?width=2662&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0cbab1e05f9e4c3535930fe7f9019ef68e959f8)\n\nIntel just gapped down after its last earnings release as margins tightened from almost 60% last year to 53.3%. Trouble lies ahead as well since Intel\u2019s 7-nanometer manufacturing is delayed which will give AMD a 6 month head start to eat away at Intel\u2019s market share. Intel has responded by initiating a huge $10 billion stock repurchase program. This is in addition to the Oct 2019 repurchase program already in place, bring total repurchases to around $20 billion.\n\nEven though Intel is in trouble, we think there\u2019s an opportunity for a longer-term play. Observe the historic Price/Sales ratio for Intel in the weekly view. We are buying today at 2.75. We\u2019ve marked entries over the last few years at the 2.75 PS level. Every entry would have been successful over a 1 year holding period. The 50 week average on the PS ratio for Intel is 3.32.\n\nNevertheless, we like to reduce risk with options, so we are not going long in Intel. We are buying a deep in the money LEAP call on Intel today at $13.90, which gives us unlimited profit potential above $53.90 and limits our losses below $40.\n\nSince this is such a long term LEAP call, we have 16 months (or 72 weeks) to sell monthly or weekly calls against this position. So while our current breakeven point is $53.90, we intend to lower our cost basis through the sale of out of the money shorter term calls.\n\nThis is strategy is called the poor man\u2019s covered call. The important point is that with a $53.90 breakeven, the lowest priced call we can sell is $54. If we sell a lower priced call and INTC were to rise too quickly, the trade could lose money.\n\nSelling next month or next week 15 delta out of the money calls should produce more than enough income to compensate us for the loss of dividends on this position and reduce our cost basis below $51, which is where Intel was trading today when we opened our long position.\n\nOur objectives for short call income generation against this position are as follows:\n\n* Initial Objective: $2.90 (Extrinsic Option Premium)\n* Secondary Objective: $4.55 (5 Quarters Dividends on 100 shares)\n* Stretch Objective: $13.90 (100% of capital recovered)\n\nIf we complete our initial objective we\u2019ll have recovered our extrinsic option premium, giving us the benefit of going long in INTC at no additional cost. If we complete the secondary objective we\u2019ll have not only recovered the option premium, but also generated 5 quarters of INTC\u2019s $0.33 dividend, making our position equal to a long position in Intel, but at 20% of the capital outlay. And our final stretch objective is to recover $13.90 over the life of this call, recovering our capital early.\n\n**Standard Exit**: Exit the trade for a profit when INTC reaches a PS ratio of 4.\n\n**Early Exit**: We exit the trade as soon as the PS ratio on INTC has recovered the 50-week moving average.\n\n**20-INTC-03**\n\n* Opening Date: Sep 1, 2020\n* Expiration Date: January 21, 2022\n* DTE: 507\n* IV: 35.81%\n* IV Percentile: 69%\n* Odds of Winning: 32.60% (before selling short calls)\n* Odds of Losing: 67.40% (before selling short calls)\n* Win: > 53.90 @ Expiration (before selling short calls)\n* Loss: < 53.90 @ Expiration (before selling short calls)\n* Reg-T Margin: $0 (long position, uses $1390 cash)\n\n**Chart Legend**\n\n* Green Area: 100% Win Zone. If we finish above or in the green area, we\u2019ve made a profit on our call. This is a long call, so our potential gain is unlimited.\n* Red Area: If we finish in this area we have a loss. The size of the red area is the size of our maximum loss. Since we\u2019ve bought a call instead of gone long, we have no additional losses below $40.\n* 1 standard deviation, 2 standard deviation, 3 standard deviation projections from Opening Date to Expiration Date are included.\n\n[See the interactive chart for this trade on TradingView.](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/INTC/SssvzRTE-Options-Idea-Buy-The-Jan-21-2022-INTC-40-0-Call-13-90/)", "id": "ikmyae", "created_utc": 1598976025.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "This is how to execute a poor man's covered call.

So we keep on offering at higher and higher levels (and retail keeps on buying) which is nuts.\n\nBecause the big tech stocks make up a huge portion on the NDX (QQQ) and SPX (SPY), we can get a little hedge on buy bidding up calls in the NDX (QQQ) and SPX (SPY).

Of course, nobody knows when that will happen. Notwithstanding, the 'edge' you get selling at x+y+z volatility is more than you got at x+y which is more than what you got at x. You may be wrong at the x and x+y levels, but at the x+y+z level you made up for your losses (from x and X+y) and then some. Thus, the snowball effect of implied volatility becoming actual volatility might be true at the x and x+y level and overstated at the x+y+z level. (There has to be some edge selling options because you need a balance sheet selling options versus buying options).\n\nSo I do agree with what you are saying that the implieds will eventually be overstating what is happening with actual volatility.

{"title": "ZNGA: Low premium, low IV call options, ready for take-off", "selftext": "Looking for something that hasn't taken off?\n\nZynga as you all know has seen its stock rise by 50% this year. The stock now trades at over 4x projected 2020 revenues, despite the fact that the company will post a loss this year. Does this make the stock expensive? I don\u2019t think so, considering that revenues could grow over 3x by 2023, along with expansion of Net Margins. I believe the stock could be north of $15 levels over the next 3 months. Here\u2019s how this is possible.\n\n**Significant outlook:** According to analysts Zynga\u2019s Revenues could grow by a little under 3x from $1.3 billion in 2019 to over $3.6 billion by 2023, representing a growth rate of roughly 29% per year (for context annual growth was about 24% between 2017 and 2019). There are multiple trends that support this continued growth. Firstly, Zynga over the recent years has acquired gaming portfolios of Small Giant Games, Gram Games, and Peak Games, and they have been doing well with increased sales. While Zynga\u2019s Daily Active Users grew slightly from 21.7 million in 2017 to 21.9 million in 2019, its Average Booking Per Daily Active User grew sharply from $0.11 in 2017 to $0.19 in 2019. The company recently announced its plans to acquire Rollic, a mobile games developer with a portfolio of hyper-casual games, and it will further bolster the company\u2019s sales growth. With the recent acquisitions of Peak and Rollic, the company\u2019s daily active user base is expected to surge to 40 million, and it will likely expand over the coming years.\n\n**Recession Proof:** Also, gaming companies, such as Zynga, have benefited in the current crisis, as the demand for gaming has gained traction, given that more people are confined to their homes, eschewing more public forms of entertainment. I believe that a significant portion of newly acquired users will stick even after the crisis winds down.\n\n**Deferred revenues will boost Q3 earnings:** While Zynga will post a loss of $550 million (on a GAAP basis as per the company\u2019s guidance) this year due to a significant change in deferred revenues, it will likely post net positive adjusted earnings. Also, the company\u2019s past investments in R&D and product development along with new acquisitions have start paying off. While other gaming companies, such as Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts, posted margins of more than 25% over the last few years (Non-GAAP Net Income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues), Zynga is a high growth company, and it could see gradual growth in margins. However, it\u2019s probably reasonable to assume that as Zynga\u2019s business gains scale, it can boost margins to about 25% in 2023. Considering our revenue projections of roughly $3.6 billion and 25% margins, $900 million in adjusted earnings is likely possible by 2023.\n\n**Bottom line:** Zynga is a solid growth stock with stellar fundamentals. The company is long overdue a big spike, so I expect this stock to jump anywhere from 10-15% in the next rally this month, so load up on September calls for maximum gains. You'll also find that IV is pretty low (around 38% for 9/25 calls) - an opportunity for those who want to ride the IV fluctuations for quick gains.  \n\n\n**Position:** ZNGA 10c 9/25", "id": "ikk29e", "created_utc": 1598966213.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "All in my entire portfolio from this DD.", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2135808765888214}, {"body": "why 9/25?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "To ride the IV fluctuations before the earnings hype", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "That way too early for the earnings hype.
