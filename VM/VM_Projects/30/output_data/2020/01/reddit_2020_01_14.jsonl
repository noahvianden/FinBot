You won't be able to successfully trade options overnight. You just won't. But I will try my best to write a quick tutorial.\n\nSo options trading involves many variables that, unless properly managed, can fuck you. First things to know:  An option is a contract giving the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset (a stock or index) at a specific price on or before a certain date (listed options are all for 100 shares of the particular underlying asset). If you think a stock will go up, you must buy calls. If you think a stock will go down, you need to buy puts. See, the important thing to know is that an option isn't like a stock. Options contracts have their own intrinsic value that is affected by their associated stock going up or down. Let's go over how you would basically approach looking into buying an option.\n\nLet's say that I think a stock (Tesla, for instance) will go up in 2 weeks. Let's say the stock is roughly where it is in today's numbers, roughly 540. I would first open the stock on Robinhood, my preferred platform, and check out the stock's history over the last week, month and year, doing cursory due diligence. If the stock looks like it is doing well, I will proceed to look up what options for that stock cost. The first thing i notice is that there are different options for each expiration date. Right now, I would likely choose a January 31st option, for two reasons: one, because it will not expire this week; Options expiring the same week you want to buy them are called FD's, and should be avoided at all costs. Two, because we know the stock is going up in like 12 days so I want an option that will expire after the stock has had a chance to go up off of the good news we know about.\n\nSo now, to review, I know I want a Tesla ($TSLA) call expiring January 31. We also know the stock is currently at $540. From our quick research earlier, we know good news can make TESLA go up fast and hard (yesterday it went up 48 bucks for no reason). With this, we want to buy a call roughly at the money (ATM), so a $540 call for TESLA. As the stocks value goes up to $550 and above in the coming weeks, the value of our option will rise as well. If the stock falls to $530, the value of our option also falls. So lets say I want to buy 10 540 calls for TESLA, at $1000 each. If the stock rises to 560 from here, I have likely made 5-10k in returns. I then sell the options at an opportune time, like the start of a trading day or a particularly good price during a day's chart where demand for the option is pushing it's value up and up. This kind of sale is called a \"naked call\" because I am not waiting until the option expires and am not excerising the option to buy, in this case, 100x10 shares of Tesla stock at a lower price than wherever it currently stands. TADA! I make tendies.\n\nThis is a fairly simple way of explaining it and is in no way a complete guide. Before these returns, I had 5 months of trial and error experience, and lots of time just watching other people make money on r/wallstreetbets. Do the time and read into this before investing, or you'll lose whatever cash you have in a dumb call or put.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you! May reply again with questions as I read.

And finding a charger becomes something limited to long road trips. They accelerate aggressively, drive smoother, cost less to maintain, they even use less brake pads because of regenerative braking. By my own real life calculation my Tesla has an MPG of over 70 and that is assuming a $2 gallon of gas. \n\n7) internal combustion engine have reached the end of their improvements, no one is going to be able to make gas cars that have an mpg even remotely close to electric. There is no significant improvement on these engines in the past 10 years. Electric is just getting started. \n\n8) Tesla already solved the problem of battery degradation, making batteries that stay within usable capacity for 500,000 miles and even claiming a million mile battery to be their standard soon.
