So any reader that disagree, I'm sorry I disagree with you, but this is just how I do it.\n\nIt's pretty simple. The investment that I'm planning to invest, will it be here for long run? Is it something that people will continue to use year, after year, decade after decade? Even when the world is in recession? I can tell you that technology is not going anywhere. Technology has become so rooted in our life it has pretty much become part of our body. So I look for technology investment, and I research and study which one is likely to be strongest tech that will survive the stock market crash, and thrive afterward. For me, that number 1 company is Microsoft. I believe - literally betting my money in it - that Microsoft is going to be with us even after we die. \n\nAnother essential in our live is energy. Our world's economy runs on energy. If there were major incident that happen somewhere in middle east that affect the oil, you can bet the entire world will feel it. But currently the problem with oil/energy is that they have been struggling really, extremely, bad to growth. Based on the Fidelity research, energy has only gain 5.44% in last 10 years while S&P 500 has grown 191.73%. That's unacceptable in my book. But one thing most oil company excel is their dividend. They're one of the top sector that pays really good dividend. \n\nAnother one I would say is bank. Bank is gonna be here forever. Imagine the world without bank? How is that gonna work out for everyone. \n\nSo basically, you want to look for company that's essential to our live. If you want long-term investment, that's why I highly recommend you look for.\n\nI know I sound kind of cocky in this post, I apologize if I offend you.

{"title": "My take on why Bed Bath and Beyond is doing so poorly.", "selftext": "$BBBY is performing so poorly,[it's largely seen as not possible to turn around by potential activists.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/26/bed-bath-beyond-has-been-a-puzzle-others-have-passed-on-solving.html) \n\nSome of the problems are obvious. You literally won't step foot in that store unless you have a physical or online coupon and unless you saved one from the mail or you are a regular on their text messaging marketing and email marketing, you can't easily obtain one **instantly.** Yes, they are \"easily\" available if you wait for one, but if I want to get a 30% coupon right now so I can go get what I need and I don't already have one, I can't do that. That's the key problem here, unlike Kohls and JCP which operate on a similar \"mandatory coupon\" strategy, BBBY doesn't make their coupons as easy as a click like JCP and Kohls have plastered all over their websites. Same goes for the other major properties they own (Buy Buy Baby and Cost Plus). The other problem is most of their 30% coupons are for one single item, which is completely retarded. Kohls and JCP issue % off the entire purchase. It just makes it even harder to want to shop there, forget about the fact that even after 30% Amazon still beats them in price. I think the rationale is that they want you to sign up for a steady marketing stream to get their coupons but that's a relationship you can only have with customers if you sell unique goods. \n\nBBBY has NO proprietary brands. Kohls has shit like \"The Big One\" and \"Apt. 9\" and JCP has an in house brand, where they can leverage their \"names\" against shitty Chinese products and make a decent margin while still selling crappy goods. BBBY sells the same shit Amazon does with a huge barrier to entry (coupon) compared to the competition. They are basically asking you not to shop there.\n\nI think the only thing keeping this company afloat are wedding and baby registries and gift cards. I have hundreds in unused gift cards to this place because it's so damn difficult to make a purchase there that even with gift card money I won't pay their prices.\n\nThere is no point to this store.", "id": "emhfhl", "created_utc": 1578609969.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 44, "comments": [{"body": "\"There is no point to this store.\"\n\nThat pretty much sums up my side of the argument with my wife whenever I find 3839393 BBBY coupons in her glove box. \n\nAnd by glove box, you know...", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "God, this has been too many of my Saturday\u2019s. \n\n\u201cWhich one of these do you like?\u201d\n\n\u201cNone because I can buy it cheaper online and there\u2019s the added benefit of not having to see any of the people in this store", "score": 24, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5029220581054688}, {"body": "Women have more hiding places than guys.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Go on and explain please.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I think you are smart enough to figure that out on your own.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "he's on wsb.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Ah shit you're right.\n\nGirls are the ones with vaginas.\nIf you've ever had less than 15 seconds to hide a condom filled with cocaine then you would know how useful vaginas are.\nThey also have other uses but as stated. \nYou are on r/WSB so those applications would just confuse you.\n\nAsk you mom to explain it after you discover hair down below.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03128289431333542}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1213487982749939}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03837951272726059}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16395574808120728}, {"body": "Men have pockets.
