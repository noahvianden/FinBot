In fact, it's the opposite:  **you'll make money in a bull market, as it results in a (hedged) bullish portfolio**.\n\nSay you have $10M invested in a diversified portfolio of large caps. We'll assume it's highly correlated with the SP500 index.\n\nTo protect the portfolio using the idea I described, you buy slightly OTM puts on the SPX. How many? Depends on how much you want to hedge, but close to a notional of $10M would make sense. So you'd buy around 30 slightly OTM puts on SPX, say the 3200 puts.\n\nThat hedge costs money. To finance it, you sell slightly OTM calls on the SPX. How many? Again, depends on how much you're hedging, and also on how much upside gains you're willing to potentially sacrifice for the sake of financing the hedge. You could for example sell 30 slightly OTM calls on SPX. Say you sell 30 of the 3400 calls expiring in 1 month from now.\n\nYou have:\n\n* \\+$10M worth of large caps\n* \\+30 SPX puts, 3200 strike, expiring in about a month\n* \\-30 SPX calls, 3400 strike, expiring in about a month\n\nThis portfolio is bullish. Specifically, it's equivalent (right now) to a \\~6.2M exposure on the SP500. Should the market go up, the portfolio will gain in value. The short call will lose value, but at a much slower pace than the whole portfolio.\n\nIf the market goes up a lot, then the short call position may eventually get in the money, until it gets to a situation where it's so deep ITM that the calls have delta close to 1, so that the overall portfolio becomes neutral: as the market goes up, the stocks make money, but the short call loses the same amount of money.\n\nYou made money on the way up: it's bullish.\n\nHere's an example: [https://i.imgur.com/2jxZBIT.png](https://i.imgur.com/2jxZBIT.png)", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5403026938438416}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.28128913044929504}, {"body": "One side talking about long call, another - about short one.\n\nBTW, short call and index going up doesn't mean losing money necessarily.

Launching at the start of 2020, the tool will be available to 5 million federal employees and their families \u2014 and Livongo is optimistic that the partnership will afford it 45,000 new members and a revenue boost of up to $60 million through 2021.

But the long-term numbers speak for themselves: https://stockcharts.com/freecharts/perf.php?SSO,SPY\n\nLet's suppose you you invest at the worst possible time in the past 20 years, September of 2007 (that's actually worse than summer of 08), and that you held until the last couple years.\n\nIf you look at the charts (link above) which take into account fees and leveraged decay, you'll see that after 10 years it outperforms the index. More specifically, you'll see that after the crash it took the normal S&P index (SPY) 4 years to get back to 0% return, whereas it took SSO an extra 1-1.5 years (about 5-6 years from the crash), about another year (about 7 years from the crash) to catch back up to the the SPY yield, and another 4-6 more years to get close to 2x-ing the SPY (got close in 2017 and currently it's close again). Keep in mind those comparisons take as a given that you invested in the worst possible time (right before the 2008 crash) and also that the market goes up (as it did) after the crash (or if it takes several years longer that's OK too)\n\nThe argument, then, is that this bet makes sense given time horizons of 20-30 years. I'm willing to make the bet that on average, over the course of say 25 years, the stock market will (1) probably have a 2008 style crash (2) and then, if that happens, it would go up to it previous levels (aren't we all betting on that?).\n\nAnd of course that's all absolutely worse case scenario. I expect it to do significantly better. If you'd have bought in, say, 2010, it was doubling the S&P pretty consistently over time and after 2 years (2010 onward) it was significantly above 2x maintained until the current day (because of the compounding effect).\n\nSo the downsides of a 2x leveraged investment are offset over long periods of time even when those long periods of time include huge stock market crashes (i.e. 2008).", "id": "ep4nl9", "created_utc": 1579106594.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "\"The long term numbers speak for themselves!\"\n\n> Links to a fucking 200 day chart in a record high year\n\nI want you to buy as much 2x as you can and hold it for 3 decades as punishment for this shitty DD", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "> Links to a fucking 200 day chart in a record high year\n\nExpand the fucking time period.
