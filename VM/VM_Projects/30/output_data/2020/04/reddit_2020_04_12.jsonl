{"title": "Is it a V or is it a U? Some food for thought.", "selftext": "I have been thinking about our current economic crisis and ingesting some of the comments of my fellow WSB\u2019ers and I wanted to really gather some of the main thoughts that I\u2019ve had and hopefully spur a conversation that goes beyond \u201cbrrrrrrr\u201d or whatever. I am no genius, and my approach to trading and investing comes more from a fundamentals standpoint than from TA.  I\u2019ve been a small business owner since a lot of you guys were in diapers (yeah, I\u2019m fucking old), and that informs a lot of my thinking on these things.  I\u2019ve also been investing/trading since 2008, so I have at least a little experience of what it\u2019s like, emotionally, to trade day to day through a crisis.  \n\nWhat I can tell you for sure about my methodology of both thinking and trading, is that it is ok for predicting movements of stocks or the market as a whole, but it is not great at timing them.  The market has humbled me into recognizing that timing things consistently (for me, anyway) is next to impossible.  This makes options trading both difficult and terrifying.  And yet here I am. \n \nSo\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nI think that everyone can look around and recognize that the situation in the economy is not ideal.  No shit, right? This is not exactly reflected in the market at the moment because of a mixture of hope for a robust recovery sooner than later, FOMO, and serious price obfuscation created by the Fed\u2019s printer turned up to 11.  I\u2019m not going to debate the necessity of JPow\u2019s actions, as I believe they were warranted to some degree, but it has injected some level of confusion into the market for sure.  We rolled into 2020 in roaring fashion, with an overall consensus of high growth and the market was priced as such.  Priced for perfection, in my opinion. For the last few weeks, we have seen forward guidance rescinded by many companies, and many are expecting an average contraction of somewhere around 30%-50%.  This is bad for shareholders obviously, but many would argue that a couple of bad quarters have been priced in to current share prices and that a bottom has been put in already.  \n\nSo where do we go from here? Everything seems, in my mind, to hinge on what happens in late Q2/early Q3.  Will it be a robust recovery or will it be slow going? Here\u2019s a few things that I\u2019ve been considering:\n\n**Many small businesses are going to go away.**                                                                This is unquestionable.  As an owner myself, and being married to another one, I can tell you that this current situation is fucked.  Our personal businesses will survive in the long term, but only because our businesses have some quirks that make us a bit more resilient.  Tons of small restaurants, shops, hotels, etc. are simply going to go away.  The longer we stay shut down, the more pronounced the effect will be, but this point is simply a fact.  Small businesses are the main driver of job creation in the US, accounting for 64% of net new jobs created.  So much of the unemployment that has arisen in recent weeks will not be going away quickly, and the rate will very much be determined by the length of the shutdown.\n\n**Businesses that do not go away are going to be in \u201csurvival mode\u201d after the shutdown.**                                                        \nThis is the second time I\u2019ve been through a financial crisis as a business owner, so I know well how this goes.  The businesses that are able to survive are going to be extremely cautious for the foreseeable future. Many will cut costs in very meaningful ways, maintaining fewer staff and doing less new hiring.  Many businesses will move even further toward using contract work/freelancers and will keep their overhead as low as possible to try any way to survive and profit.  There will likely be much less put into capital expenditures and long term (high dollar)investments for growth.  Once again, the severity of this lies very much in the length of the shutdown.\n\n**Supply Chain Shock**                                                                                                                          This survival mode of small businesses is going to put negative pressure on the buy side of supply chains in addition to the supply side damage that was done during the first part of the shutdowns.  There will be lasting damage done to trade partnerships due to unmet obligations on both sides of many contracts causing a lot of fragmentation and instability in the market.  \n\n**Consumer Shock**                                                                                                                              The cautious spending will not be limited to business owners trying to survive.  This can and will trickle down into consumer spending, also driven by the high levels of unemployment.  With consumption accounting for 70% of the US GDP,  any psychological damage to the consumption mechanism of the US economy is going to make any recovery anemic at best. \n\n**Vaccine/Therapies**                                           \t\t\t\t\t       This is another of the \u201cmake it or break it\u201d aspects, as everyone can see.  If we were to develop and manufacture a vaccine or a highly effective therapeutic in the next few weeks, I believe we could very well get the V shape recovery that everyone wants.  Being able to open up the country sometime in May could very well make a lot of the economic effects of the crisis less permanent.  It sounds like a tall order to me, and is so far out of my wheelhouse that I don\u2019t know the probabilities of such an occurrence.  To listen to Fauci, I would say the odds are low, but his is not the only opinion out there.  Maybe someone in the medical/pharmaceutical manufacturing field could chime in on this.  \n\n**Inflation/Stagflation**                                                             \t\t\t                       Monetizing the fiscal deficit\thas been necessary, and we can expect more of it in the coming year (especially in an election year).  But if the worst case scenario starts to play out and we have a recurrence of the virus with no vaccine or therapies available and another shutdown is required, there is a point at which we run the risk of incredible inflation/stagflation.  The printer can end up causing more problems than it solved, but I feel that political pressure will keep it humming for a good portion of this year.  If the incumbent president is re-elected, I would not anticipate that to continue into 2021. \n \n**Recurrance of Virus**\t\t\t\t\t\t                                       Political pressure to reopen the country\u2019s economy is incredibly high.  However, if we reopen without highly effective therapeutics or a vaccine, we will almost certainly see a wave 2 outbreak, causing us to have to shut down the economy again.  If you thought the first leg down in the market was bad, try imagining what it\u2019s going to do when California or NYC announces that they are shutting down a second time. This is a tricky tightrope that the president\u2019s administration is trying to walk.  \n\n**Election Year Shenanigans**              \t\t\t\t\t                              I\u2019m not going to go into any kind of conspiracy theories or anything like that, but suffice it to say that there seems to be a significant opportunity for \u201cirregularities\u201d to occur during this upcoming US election.  Between Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea, I would say that somewhere out there lies an appetite for regime change here in the US.  High-level cyber-attacks are almost a given.  Likewise, our President seems to have some dictatorial leanings and it would not seem unlikely for him to take unprecedented steps to remain in power.  If we move more toward digital absentee voting, maybe as a social distancing measure, there will very possibly be public outcry of a rigged election regardless of the outcome, and social unrest would not be a surprising result. \t                    \n\n**TL;DR:  Small businesses are fucked, unemployment may remain high even after reopening the economy.  Much is dependant on the speed at which we develop/manufacture/distribute treatments for the virus.  Fed printer is needed, but keep it up for too long and 2021/22 will be ffffffuuuuuucked. \nSPY 12/18 220p**", "id": "fzmrqt", "created_utc": 1586652383.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "It\u2019s wubble U", "score": 30, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07255759835243225}, {"body": "Sir, this is the bread line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A miracle treatment is possible, but not a vaccine. The reason why is simple.\n\nTo get one approved by the FDA you have to do a small human trial for 12 months, say 40-50 people. If those people don't have side effects and the vaccine is effective at preventing them from getting rona, you get approved for a second 12 month trial of a much larger sample, say 40,000-50,000. This one is giving you better data on efficacy and checking for rarer side effects, drug interactions, etc. This one can be lowered to 6 months with FDA approval.\n\nThat's why literally every doctor at the start of the crisis was saying 18 months. That's the best case, but also very likely since we started a very high number of stage one human trials concurrently. If they try to roll one out sooner, say at the 12 month mark, just know that they're basing it on a tiny sample size and have somewhat limited data to support it working, ie, no fucking way I'm getting it. I'm not in a high risk group and I'll take my chances with the rona.\n\nIf they try to roll one out really soon, say at the 4 month mark, the medical community will lose their minds.

{"title": "Is it a V or is it a U? Some food for thought.", "selftext": "I have been thinking about our current economic crisis and ingesting some of the comments of my fellow WSB\u2019ers and I wanted to really gather some of the main thoughts that I\u2019ve had and hopefully spur a conversation that goes beyond \u201cbrrrrrrr\u201d or whatever. I am no genius, and my approach to trading and investing comes more from a fundamentals standpoint than from TA.  I\u2019ve been a small business owner since a lot of you guys were in diapers (yeah, I\u2019m fucking old), and that informs a lot of my thinking on these things.  I\u2019ve also been investing/trading since 2008, so I have at least a little experience of what it\u2019s like, emotionally, to trade day to day through a crisis.  \n\nWhat I can tell you for sure about my methodology of both thinking and trading, is that it is ok for predicting movements of stocks or the market as a whole, but it is not great at timing them.  The market has humbled me into recognizing that timing things consistently (for me, anyway) is next to impossible.  This makes options trading both difficult and terrifying.  And yet here I am. \n \nSo\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\n\nI think that everyone can look around and recognize that the situation in the economy is not ideal.  No shit, right? This is not exactly reflected in the market at the moment because of a mixture of hope for a robust recovery sooner than later, FOMO, and serious price obfuscation created by the Fed\u2019s printer turned up to 11.  I\u2019m not going to debate the necessity of JPow\u2019s actions, as I believe they were warranted to some degree, but it has injected some level of confusion into the market for sure.  We rolled into 2020 in roaring fashion, with an overall consensus of high growth and the market was priced as such.  Priced for perfection, in my opinion. For the last few weeks, we have seen forward guidance rescinded by many companies, and many are expecting an average contraction of somewhere around 30%-50%.  This is bad for shareholders obviously, but many would argue that a couple of bad quarters have been priced in to current share prices and that a bottom has been put in already.  \n\nSo where do we go from here? Everything seems, in my mind, to hinge on what happens in late Q2/early Q3.  Will it be a robust recovery or will it be slow going? Here\u2019s a few things that I\u2019ve been considering:\n\n**Many small businesses are going to go away.**                                                                This is unquestionable.  As an owner myself, and being married to another one, I can tell you that this current situation is fucked.  Our personal businesses will survive in the long term, but only because our businesses have some quirks that make us a bit more resilient.  Tons of small restaurants, shops, hotels, etc. are simply going to go away.  The longer we stay shut down, the more pronounced the effect will be, but this point is simply a fact.  Small businesses are the main driver of job creation in the US, accounting for 64% of net new jobs created.  So much of the unemployment that has arisen in recent weeks will not be going away quickly, and the rate will very much be determined by the length of the shutdown.\n\n**Businesses that do not go away are going to be in \u201csurvival mode\u201d after the shutdown.**                                                        \nThis is the second time I\u2019ve been through a financial crisis as a business owner, so I know well how this goes.  The businesses that are able to survive are going to be extremely cautious for the foreseeable future. Many will cut costs in very meaningful ways, maintaining fewer staff and doing less new hiring.  Many businesses will move even further toward using contract work/freelancers and will keep their overhead as low as possible to try any way to survive and profit.  There will likely be much less put into capital expenditures and long term (high dollar)investments for growth.  Once again, the severity of this lies very much in the length of the shutdown.\n\n**Supply Chain Shock**                                                                                                                          This survival mode of small businesses is going to put negative pressure on the buy side of supply chains in addition to the supply side damage that was done during the first part of the shutdowns.  There will be lasting damage done to trade partnerships due to unmet obligations on both sides of many contracts causing a lot of fragmentation and instability in the market.  \n\n**Consumer Shock**                                                                                                                              The cautious spending will not be limited to business owners trying to survive.  This can and will trickle down into consumer spending, also driven by the high levels of unemployment.  With consumption accounting for 70% of the US GDP,  any psychological damage to the consumption mechanism of the US economy is going to make any recovery anemic at best. \n\n**Vaccine/Therapies**                                           \t\t\t\t\t       This is another of the \u201cmake it or break it\u201d aspects, as everyone can see.  If we were to develop and manufacture a vaccine or a highly effective therapeutic in the next few weeks, I believe we could very well get the V shape recovery that everyone wants.  Being able to open up the country sometime in May could very well make a lot of the economic effects of the crisis less permanent.  It sounds like a tall order to me, and is so far out of my wheelhouse that I don\u2019t know the probabilities of such an occurrence.  To listen to Fauci, I would say the odds are low, but his is not the only opinion out there.  Maybe someone in the medical/pharmaceutical manufacturing field could chime in on this.  \n\n**Inflation/Stagflation**                                                             \t\t\t                       Monetizing the fiscal deficit\thas been necessary, and we can expect more of it in the coming year (especially in an election year).  But if the worst case scenario starts to play out and we have a recurrence of the virus with no vaccine or therapies available and another shutdown is required, there is a point at which we run the risk of incredible inflation/stagflation.  The printer can end up causing more problems than it solved, but I feel that political pressure will keep it humming for a good portion of this year.  If the incumbent president is re-elected, I would not anticipate that to continue into 2021. \n \n**Recurrance of Virus**\t\t\t\t\t\t                                       Political pressure to reopen the country\u2019s economy is incredibly high.  However, if we reopen without highly effective therapeutics or a vaccine, we will almost certainly see a wave 2 outbreak, causing us to have to shut down the economy again.  If you thought the first leg down in the market was bad, try imagining what it\u2019s going to do when California or NYC announces that they are shutting down a second time. This is a tricky tightrope that the president\u2019s administration is trying to walk.  \n\n**Election Year Shenanigans**              \t\t\t\t\t                              I\u2019m not going to go into any kind of conspiracy theories or anything like that, but suffice it to say that there seems to be a significant opportunity for \u201cirregularities\u201d to occur during this upcoming US election.  Between Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea, I would say that somewhere out there lies an appetite for regime change here in the US.  High-level cyber-attacks are almost a given.  Likewise, our President seems to have some dictatorial leanings and it would not seem unlikely for him to take unprecedented steps to remain in power.  If we move more toward digital absentee voting, maybe as a social distancing measure, there will very possibly be public outcry of a rigged election regardless of the outcome, and social unrest would not be a surprising result. \t                    \n\n**TL;DR:  Small businesses are fucked, unemployment may remain high even after reopening the economy.  Much is dependant on the speed at which we develop/manufacture/distribute treatments for the virus.  Fed printer is needed, but keep it up for too long and 2021/22 will be ffffffuuuuuucked. \nSPY 12/18 220p**", "id": "fzmrqt", "created_utc": 1586652383.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "It\u2019s wubble U", "score": 30, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07255759090185165}, {"body": "Sir, this is the bread line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

A miracle treatment is possible, but not a vaccine. The reason why is simple.\n\nTo get one approved by the FDA you have to do a small human trial for 12 months, say 40-50 people. If those people don't have side effects and the vaccine is effective at preventing them from getting rona, you get approved for a second 12 month trial of a much larger sample, say 40,000-50,000. This one is giving you better data on efficacy and checking for rarer side effects, drug interactions, etc. This one can be lowered to 6 months with FDA approval.\n\nThat's why literally every doctor at the start of the crisis was saying 18 months. That's the best case, but also very likely since we started a very high number of stage one human trials concurrently. If they try to roll one out sooner, say at the 12 month mark, just know that they're basing it on a tiny sample size and have somewhat limited data to support it working, ie, no fucking way I'm getting it. I'm not in a high risk group and I'll take my chances with the rona.\n\nIf they try to roll one out really soon, say at the 4 month mark, the medical community will lose their minds.
