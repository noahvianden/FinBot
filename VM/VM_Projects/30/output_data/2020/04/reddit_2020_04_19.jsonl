{"title": "Why you should be writing jade lizards in this market", "selftext": "Many of you are still bearish and some of you have gone full retard mode bullish, but there\u2019s a theta gang play that will satisfy both your bearish and bullish desires. The jade lizard is a spread that will allow you to take advantage of the inherent larger IV on puts while simultaneously hedging you further from downsides via the sale of a call credit spread.\n\nHow does it work? You write a cash secured put as well as a call credit spread on a security. For instance, for the week that just passed, I wrote a 56.5 put on SQ and simultaneously sold the 61.5/62 call credit spread. I closed the spread at 50% profit.\n\nFor May 15, I\u2019m looking at MSFT as well as MGM. Personally, I\u2019m an ultra msft bull and wouldn\u2019t mind getting assigned a 100 satya shares. I\u2019m also happy holding MGM shares, and the IV for puts is crazy. Personally, for MGM, it seems that weekly options will also give you quite lucrative returns with relatively little risk. Twitter is also a good stock for this as well as AMD. Basically, you wanna do this on a stock u wouldn\u2019t mind holding. I\u2019m bullish on all the tickers above but also don\u2019t wanna go full bull mode hence this mildly bullish trade.

At about 6AM after basically blowing all my cash on making everything perfect, I tried to take out my last $40 while she gave me $60 so I could finally try Poker.\n\nSomehow, on the way to the table at Harrah\u2019s, I couldn\u2019t find the $40 I just took out of the ATM. Okay, everyone\u2019s laughing at me too poor to play. So I leave the $100 buy in table and join two old people working on the $20 table. \n\nOpen my wallet and somehow, $100 is magically there. Okay, fuck these old hacks back at the only table at 4AM with people playing. My wife showed me ring #10 at the gift shoppe, let\u2019s do this.\n\nThe moment she dealt while everyone got their last minute guffawing in, I pulled my cards up to peek at two fucking aces, hearts and spades. My guy, I nearly fell off the fucking chair. I decided to play it smart, lifted the cards off the table like its fucking Uno and pretend I suddenly can\u2019t see without glasses.\n\nThe rancorous laughter as the dealer told me \u201csir, put your cards on the table\u201d only sent my erection into full pressure zone as I let them laugh and pretended I was just \u201cnew\u201d.\n\nDidn\u2019t push the first table draw, let them basically up thinking they can bust the newbie. Simply \u201ccall\u201d (I asked her how to do it to let them laugh just a little more). If I remember next is the turn, cards are all over, all chances of straight are basically gone except for like a 3-6 which had potential on the flop. Flop comes out, nice it\u2019s just another 7, someone probably thinks they have a two pair. Decide to say \u201chey if I win or lose I had fun all in\u201d and everyone is like \ud83d\ude0a\n\nShowdown comes and I asked them to all show first, and I said \u201care these good?\u201d\n\nPut the aces down and it was stone silence. Just the sound of me sorting all their chips from the pot, carved off what I think was $20 because I made about $500+ that moment, went to the gift shoppe right that moment, got her the ring, and the next day we blew it all at the little pool party club they have at Harrahs.\n\nThat\u2019s how you get a supermodel to marry you, and now we make masks and crush Etsy sales.", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "This is the stupidest fucking thing I\u2019ve ever read. \n\nP.S.
