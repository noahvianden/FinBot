{"title": "For Trading April 7th", "selftext": "\nFor Trading April 7th\n \n \nSTOCKS RUN-UP\nOil Falls\n \nFalse Hopes\n \n \nToday was an amazing day!  I don\u2019t believe that the bottom has been made, and I don\u2019t think that today was a day to be a buyer, but as my Closing Comments says, \u201cI could not have been more wrong.\u201d  We cut through every area of supply that I pointed out in last night\u2019s Weekly Strategies.  Here is the closing comment for tonight: https://youtu.be/JHjU3KOAQR8 .  My problem with today\u2019s action is that while everyone wants to believe that this was the bottom, historically, it is without precedent.  There are many problems that we will face that are not currently known. The earnings of the companies that have no idea how long consumers are not buying clothes at Macy\u2019s or TJ Maxx, or restaurants, where it\u2019s not like you can make up the business with people eating 2 meals at a time.  The closure of the Airbus plant in Alabama, or American Airlines cutting their N.Y. flights from 271 /day down to 13 is just not something that can be quantified when it comes to the net effect to both the balance sheet and profits.  But the DJIA was +1627.46 (7.73%), NASDAQ +540.16 (7.33%), S&P 500 +175.03 (7.03%), the Russell +86.72 (8.24%) and the DJ Transports +532.38 (7.29%).  Market internals left a lot to be desired with the A/D solid at NYSE 9.5:1 and NASDAQ 5.5:1, but volume was anemic with NYSE 1.4 billion and the NASDAQ 3.8 billion. All 30 DJIA stocks were higher with BA leading the way +113.31 DP\u2019s but no other triple digit winners.  On the +11.37% gainer on 3/24 there were 10 triple-digit winners.  The strongest groups were Information technology, financials and consumer discretionary, with only Consumer Staples weak.\n \n \n \nOur \u201copen forum\u201d on Discord, which allows me to interact with subscribers and others to allow direct questions and chart opinions on just about any stock, continues to grow with more participants every day.  It is informative and allows me to share insights as the market is open and moving.  The link is: https://discord.gg/ATvC7YZ  and I will be there and active from before the open and all day.  It\u2019s a great place to share ideas and gain some insights, and we\u2019ve grown to almost 1400 members.\n \n \nSECTORS: We started with positive numbers from Europe on COVID-19 deaths and the first group pre-market were the some of the smaller biotech firms with Inovio Pharma (INO) started with a gap up and after trading over $8.80, never quite made it back in regular hours and closed $8.44 +.70 (9.04%), Immunomedics (IMMU) ended a trial for their breast cancer treatment because it\u2019s efficacy was confirmed.  The stock, which traded as high as $27.33 in 2018 had fallen to $8.80 last week opened the day at $20.09 but sold off a bit to close $18.78 +9.38 (99.79%).  Also in the same group, CODX finished $10.31 +2.11 (25.73%) and VIR $36.70 +7.70 (26.55%).  In another group, Wayfair beat both revenues and earnings and the home goods company, which traded down from $173 last year to a low of 21.70 on 3/19 gapped up to open $70.28 and closed $71.50 +20.87 (41.22%).\n \n \nBIOPHARMA: was HIGHER with BIIB +9.58, ABBV +2.31, REGN +10.95, ISRG +37.33 (8.07%), MYL +.30, TEVA +.94 (11.19%), VRTX +17.69 (7.42%), BHC +1.27, INCY +6.80, ICPT +3.90, LABU +4.44 (22.11%) and IBB $110.50 +4.25 (4%).\n \n \nCANNABIS: This group was HIGHER with TLRY +,45, CGC +1.10, CRON +.20, GWPH +4.78, PYX +.18, NBEV +.05, CURLF +.13, KERN +.80 (14.75%) and MJ $10.96 +.52 (4.98%).\n \n \nDEFENSE: was HIGHER with LMT +16.50 (4.71%), RTX (the combination of RTN and UTX) was +7.32 (14.66%), gd +8.07, txt +2.49, noc +18.98, bwxt +.42, tdy +19.66 (6.81%) and ITA $148.00 +12.10 (8.9%).\n \n \nRETAIL: was HIGHER with M + .94 (19.54%), JWN +3.38 (25.9%), KSS +3.04 (26.41%), DDS +8.93 (37.41%), JCP +.05 (18.34%), WMT +5.92, TGT +4.93, TJX +5.15 (12.57%), RL +7.60 (12.46%), UAA +.77, LULU +12.75, TPR +2.09, CPRI +2.17 (25.44%) and XRT $30.21 +3.02 (11.11%).\n \n \nFAANG and Big Cap: were HIGHER with GOOGL +89.36, AMZN +83.41, AAPL +21.29 (8.82%), FB +10.82, NFLX +17.22, NVDA +25.47 (10.44%), TSLA +32.99, BABA +9.39, BIDU +5.66, BA +23.38 (18.78%), CAT +5.33, DIS +5.92 and XLK $83.70 +6.58 (8.53%).\n \nFINANCIALS were HIGHER with GS +10.07, JPM +5.45, BAC +1.41, MS +3.40, C +3.51, PNC +9.12, AIG +1.11, TRV +5.09, AXP +10.70 (14.54%) and XLF $21.05 +1.41 (7.18%).\n \n \nOIL, $26.08 -2.26. The explosive moves in Oil recently have been news driven and the cancellation of the OPEC meeting and the threat of tariffs from Mr. Trump have cut off the rally from the $20.00 level.  Today\u2019s decline had little to do with the Oil stocks as all were higher.  CVX +5.40, XOM +1.40, OXY +.50, NBL +.49, MRO +.02, MPC +3.03 (15.10%), RIG +.05, APA +.62, BP +.28 and XLE $31.41 +1.58 (5.3%).\n \n \nMETALS, GOLD: $1,693.90 + 48.20. After the recent gains, Gold has failed to break through the highs around $1700 until today when it traded $1,715 before selling off a bit. Tonight, it has traded as high as $1742.00 and looks to be higher in the near future.\n \nBITCOIN: closed $7,330 +530. After we traded in a short-range day followed by a $1,000 range on Friday BTC closed above $7,000 for the first time since it broke to the downside early last month.  While I want to add the 350 sold just over a week ago, I want to wait and see some stabilization.  We still own 400 GBTC with an average of $8.06. GBTC closed $7.95 + .47 today.\n \nTomorrow is another day.\n \nCAM", "id": "fwczcz", "created_utc": 1586229353.0, "score": 203, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "Spy is gapping up again as I read this.

It all depends on what you think will happen. Say you bought BA at 125. If BA is worth 145 now then you're at +20 per share. If you think that it will dip to a lower amount at any point then it makes sense to sell. So if it dips again to, say, 135 and you buy again at that price then you make an extra $10 per share, because you bought the same exact stock for $10 cheaper than you owned it for.\n\nHowever, if you sell and BA does not dip below 145 again then you essentially lost money because you could have either held it or sold it for higher value. And if you choose to sell at 145 and later buy for 155 then you lost $10 per share that you could have had (but you still come out +10 because you originally gained 20).

{"title": "Do Those Options You Are Looking to Buy Seem Expensive?", "selftext": "*\"Even a seven sigma event cannot touch us.\" - some douche bag at Long Term Capital Management and the Origin of \"this can't go tits up.\"*\n\nI like to share something I use and observe each week with this community. If you are a sole stock picker (per se), let me save you the time and tell you this post is pointless to read. Move on. \n\nFirst are foremost. as most of you know, volatility is a bitch. And like a bitch, it can be expensive. Trust me, I'm a little bitch and I''m expensive, or so says my boyfriend's girlfriend.\n\nBut the term \"expensive\" depends on what lens you look through. If you say, \"It's expensive relative to history.\", then yes; this tends to be the lens most I speak with look through. However, I prefer to say, \"It may just be inline with financial conditions.\" I'll further argue this from a bull and bear point of view.\n\nI am not going to drag this post out with explanations and definitions. I will provide link(s) so you can do your own research. I'll ask myself seemingly smart questions, provide logical answers, and likely post loss porn by the end of Q2. For those who wish to know my position and don't give a shit about the rest of this post, scroll down to the end. \n\n**I believe the single best indicator of financial market conditions, i.e. the health of the financial system, is** ***The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago's National Financial Conditions Index****.* \n\n[Here is the background to the NFCI](https://www.chicagofed.org/research/data/nfci/background). Within this, you can find a list of indicators which are used within the formula to derive its value. \n\n***Laymen: the more negative the NFCI, the looser financial conditions; positive values mean tighter conditions. Fed likes it loose right now. Powell was new and he was tight, then Trump grabbed him by the...***\n\nWhat the fuck does this have to do with the price of the options you ask? **81% of the time, implied volatility across four assets correlates to the movement of the NFCI**. Those four assets are: \n\n1. S&P 500 (VIX), \n2. EUR/USD proxy FXE (EVZ), \n3. 10Y UST Note Futures (VXTYN) and,\n4. Gold proxy GLD (GVZ).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is the breakdown of correlation by each, and the average of the four IV indexes:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Correlation of IV Indexes to NFCI](https://preview.redd.it/8qfq9zulgbr41.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e919acca9f61328f888b51adaa1a9958375c77e)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**NFCI lags, which does not make it a predicative indicator.** That is bad news. However, NFCI is not very volatile over history, which means it trends pretty well. Good news. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[NFCI W\\/o\\/W changes and 52wk average](https://preview.redd.it/wihc3l3pgbr41.png?width=1117&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9901b62efa0ad69f181d2fe27455c9da9612804)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCharting all implied volatility indexes to the NFCI gives us this picture:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[10 Years of Values for NFCI and Implied Vol Indexes, including an Average of IV Indexes](https://preview.redd.it/so4lvgjtgbr41.png?width=1166&format=png&auto=webp&s=a74890273e819c99e539a5191780c1d64065c3cc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nZooming in to the chart above, only viewing YTD:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Same chat as above, but YTD](https://preview.redd.it/m7sh9a4zgbr41.png?width=844&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b466d3c3fe474251a83beb839c8cd06c67d3728)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNarrowing the chart down to just the average of the four looks like this (10 Year Period):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Same as two charts above, but IV Index Averages Only](https://preview.redd.it/vnuvp791hbr41.png?width=1229&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e5ed7ee4dced41a37fba0c3a65743b4f5a5f2c7)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's talk about downfalls. For one, the period of data is very limited. Number two, the VIX carries much more weight within the average of the four given it is, historically, the most volatile of the implied volatility indexes. This could mean the average may not budge much with the explosion of IV in EUR/USD (FXE) or USTs (in 10Y note futures). Third, as mentioned before, you cannot predict much with this.\n\nSo what do I use it for? As someone who is primarily macro, US (ec)centric, I observe it as a measure of how I choose to \"play\" options. **In other words, is my options book net debit or net credit.**\n\n**What are the values telling me at present? As of the latest reading, options are expensive. But this simple view is derived from the average, which is weight more so the the VIX.** It could be argued that as financial conditions worsen (presumably given indicators), implied volatility is, at worst, slightly elevated, but likely in line. I'll explain further in by bull and bear arguments.\n\nA better way to visualize could be take current implied volatility index readings and divide it by its historical 10 year average. When plotted against NFCI, you can better see how the average (of the four implied vol indexed) relates to NFCI values. Doing this improves correlation slightly, to 0.83. The green line represents the 10 year average, where the red line represents double the average. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Visually, an easier way to identify implied volatility levels compared to average, relative to NFCI values](https://preview.redd.it/ed12arq5hbr41.png?width=1106&format=png&auto=webp&s=c830d6e199d99f61112d74101b0c4acbfd8c2e15)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo put this into numbers, over the past 10 Years, the VIX average is 17.09, EVZ 9.64, VXTYN 5.44, and GVZ 16.93. As of the latest readings, VIX is 267% above its average, EVZ +36%, VXTYN +78%, GVZ +129%.\n\nThe following ***Bull and Bear Arguments*** are from a more-equity (SPX) perspective. However, it also takes into account a bull and bear perspective on implied vol, where a bull view is an option writer and a bear view is an option buyer.\n\nWith that, the ***Bull Argument*** is quite clear: financial conditions are worsening, however the Federal Reserve actions are likely to work as they have in the past, and at worst, implied volatility levels will continue to fall, moving ever so closer to trend(line). The Fed's action may soon improve financial conditions, implying that options are very expensive. Seems like buy writes would make the most sense, observing from a long-only standpoint. Also, put-writes or risk reversals.\n\nThe ***(gay) Bear Argument*** is that the data provided only is for the past 10 years, does not display a recession, and the \"outlier\" readings may not be abnormal when the economic cycle is shifting, i.e. financial conditions are tightening. We are in the early innings of a cycle of de-risking and de-leveraging (likely, forced) and any calm that may come, where implied volatility gravitates towards trend(line), is an opportunity to buy options; puts, calls, debit spreads.\n\nThe trend I speak of refers to the linear trendline in my charts.\n\nLast note: ***higher implied volatility does not equate to direction of price movement.*** Yes, for VIX, it tends to move higher when SPX is falling. But this does not have to occur. Another way of looking at this is to play the game of hindsight: if the average implied vol of the four assets were at all-time lows then ***long straddles and strangles*** would have been ideal as opposed to picking the direction of price.\n\nI might update these charts as time goes on, depending on feedback, or lack thereof. I'm sure I'll have some edits along the way.\n\n**Position: generally, bent over.**", "id": "fwdmda", "created_utc": 1586231983.0, "score": 110, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 38, "comments": [{"body": "Long PowerPoint.\n\nGiving the .ppt a whole new meaning.\n\nI mean what in God\u2019s name is all this info.", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "It was .sh", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16563013195991516}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10441869497299194}, {"body": "Enjoyed the read.

Same with EUR, and the 10Y is a bet on the yield curve shape.  But is it different for VIX (which is purely about SPX value)?  I'm thinking that when VIX is at all time lows it's best to hold puts since VIX moves inverse to SPX.  Since most investors are long, a big drop in SPX is scary so they want options.  But if it goes up big, they're not scared and writing options looks like free money so VIX goes down. \n\nIt would be interesting to see what the overall payoff on writing options is.

They sell options for peanuts when it's smooth sailing then every couple years things blow up and they get fucked.  But presumably it pays off overall.  Or maybe it only pays off if they sell options only above a certain VIX level, especially if they have risk limits that could force them to buy high after selling low.
