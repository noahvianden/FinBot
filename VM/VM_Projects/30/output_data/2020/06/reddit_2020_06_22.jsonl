It's the money you don't need that you can choose to put into stonks, into another investment or spend it on hookers.\n\nAsset inflation is because of interest rates: You put your money in stonks instead of bonds because they yield zip.\n\nThe money \"printing\" doesn't inflate assets it maintains their value.

You have to remember that heavy subsidization of entire markets takes place to keep enough producers around to avoid supply shocks. Take agriculture for instance, billions of dollars goes to it every year. Or key manufacturing (defense and auto). There aren't many producers around anymore either. 1/3 of jobs are government jobs which are usually bureaucracy and infrastructure maintenance. Another 1/3 is government contracts (defense, utility, etc). So 1/3 is service and producing. I think you're more likely to see the service side bottom out, go unprofitable because commercial rent is insane, and lose a lot of service companies (and entry level jobs). So money velocity is going to crater but the Fed is just going to let service industries fail and make banks absorb the commercial real estate hit. This way money velocity doesn't pick up causing hyperinflation. But there's tons of unemployed so the Fed will (and has) push for temporary extension of unemployment until most of the treasuries have matured off the balance sheet to reign loose dollars back in. \n\nThe problem is if the treasury can't pay the Fed, this means taxes on a stressed economy and will lead to stagflation as new competitors struggle to get into the market because of tighter lending requirements, bad market health, and lower returns (because of taxes). Add in the very real possibility of an increase in minimum wage and public works programs again and we might hit the Greatest Depression. But that also means war is brewing so expect things with China to go south (proxy wars until shit goes really bad).\n\nThe curve ball is if enough people die from the virus, then entitlements go down, which lets the government pillage social security benefits to pay the Fed on the short term treasuries. So, it's a real possibility that the retirement states don't close down (Florida, Arizona, etc). They'll put in triage orders for anyone in their 70s, maybe even 65. But enough young people still need to pay their social security taxes so we're going to overhaul the bridges and roads. So the best move is for the government to downplay the virus.\n\nWe're several steps away from hitting any commodity issues. There needs to be something that locks up agriculture. But they're in low density areas (no virus concerns), heavily subsidized, and unaffected if manufacturing closes because they can repair equipment. They have a huge built in buffer for corn production because of the ethanol gas subsidies, so that production can be sold for food at any time. I guess meat plants will have a harder time with the virus, but then we rotate crops to high protein plants to fill in the substitute market. \n\nThe issue is in 2-3 years, not right now.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.057074174284935}, {"body": "I went all in on SLV calls so my autism is developed", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Jnug when gold/silver goes up, Jdst when gold/silver goes down.
