DD", "selftext": "#Thesis: Kind of a stale company which is lagging behind its competitors, *buy it on valuation alone*. \n\nWe also have a new CEO coming in for the last 6 months providing some tail upside and also some possible downside(net-net, a minor positive)\n\nCloudera made money by creating solutions for Hadoop, which customers are moving away from. So instead, Cloudera is moving toward leveraging AWS, MSFT, GOOG's cloud infrastructure and building tools on top of it to pivot their existing client base toward products that actually work. Whether this succeeds or fails will remain to be seen. \n\nThe company also has a pretty significant consulting arm which generates around 10% of their sales, and of course is involved in selling the company's products. Kinda like IBM or other shit companies. The difference is that Cloudera is actually growing their subscription revenue at the clip of 20% in 2020 compared to these others which just decline. (This consulting arm is not a profit center, but exists to drive subscription revenue)\n\nMy personal belief working in this industry: You can deliver a kinda shit solution and get an A+ because the customers are so hungry to be able to actually look at their data and there is a shortage of the relevant expertise. We can still have a turnaround story, and Cloudera is at the end of the day a young company. It's not quite \"IBM selling mainframes in 2020\" just yet. \n\nOK so let's take a look at some valuation metrics around this here company:\n\nP/S: 5x\n\nSubscription Sales FY 2020: 825M - 875M (doubled since 2 years prior, also had doubled 2 years prior before that, reflecting consistent sales growth. Of course the growth going forward is NOT gonna be consistent, it is gonna Fuck.You.In.The.Ass.jpeg. Don't say I didn't warn you).\n\nGross margin: Around 85% for their subscription revenue (read: pretty fuckin' good) and not going down.\n\nIn other words we have a stock trading around 7x gross profit -- that's pretty low... the single relevant question revolves around how much reinvestment is necessary to preserve that gross profit? Ballpark I'd say around 1/3, making this a stock that trades around 10x steady state earnings... pretty good.\n\n\nMoral of this story: If you're impressed by this laundry list of numbers and some words, then be long with me on CLDR and lose some money with honor. I will print out a sticker for you that says 'value investor like Warry Buffy' and we can share a few drinks at the autism convention. \n\nNOW --- the most important thing. If this stock hits $18, and I think it will, then unless the fundamentals have moved significantly since then, I am prolly going to sell. What we're seeing now is something like a bear #market rally and I'm happy to walk away with a 40% return.", "id": "hi86va", "created_utc": 1593462960.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "It took me the first word \u201cthesis\u201d to realize a true autist was the author of this post", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "I\u2019d like it better if it was a hypothesis.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3088163733482361}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04968414455652237}, {"body": "I yolod into cloudera earnings, set my account back -75%.
