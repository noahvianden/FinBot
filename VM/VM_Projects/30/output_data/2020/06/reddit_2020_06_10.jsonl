I thought their agenda is to keep the index up?**\n\n# A Stock Market Crash or Correction Is Inevitable -- History Says So\n\nIt's an absolutely wild time to be an investor. It could be argued  that in a span of less than four months, investors witnessed about a  decade's worth of volatility.\n\nThe physical and  financial toll tied to the COVID-19 pandemic led to an incredible amount  of selling pressure in the broad-based **S&P 500** (SNPINDEX: \\^GSPC)  by mid-February. After closing at an all-time high on Feb. 19, the  benchmark index proceeded to lose 34% of its value in a stretch of just  33 calendar days. The 17-trading-session [decline into bear market territory](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/12/rip-to-the-longest-bull-market-in-history-2009-202.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=19b6aa15-b6be-4dd3-a2a1-5723d6f74c1a), as well as the expediency of the 30% drop, mark the swiftest descents from a recent high in history.\n\nBut just  as quickly as the stock market fell off a cliff, it seems to have  reestablished a brand-new bull market. Over the past 11 weeks, the  S&P 500 has rallied more than 40% off of its March 23 lows and even  has its all-time high within sight.\n\nThe question is:  Can this immense rally last in the wake of weak economic data, or should  investors expect another stock market crash or correction? History  would suggest that the latter is inevitable.\n\n## Statistically speaking, crashes or corrections following a bear market are normal\n\nAccording to data provided by Wall Street analytics company [Yardeni Research](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/sp500corrbear.pdf), there have been eight official bear-market declines (a non-rounded drop of at least 20%) since 1960 in the [S&P 500](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/indexes/sp-500/?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=19b6aa15-b6be-4dd3-a2a1-5723d6f74c1a),  not counting the COVID-19 bear market. In the three years subsequent to  each of these previous eight bear markets, or until the next bear  market hit, if less than three years, there were 13 official stock  market corrections of at least 10% (again, not rounded). On average, the  bounce-back from a bear market is going to feature either one or two  10% to 19.9% drops in the S&P 500.\n\nFor example, the Great Recession wiped away almost 57% of the value  of the S&P 500, before bottoming out in March 2009. Though in  hindsight, we know the rally from those lows was ferocious, investors  put up with a 16% decline spanning 70 calendar days in 2010, and a 19.4%  drop covering five months in 2011.\n\nAlso, following  the end of the dot-com bubble in 2002, the market almost immediately  corrected for 104 calendar days after a double-digit-percentage bounce  for the S&P 500 from its lows.\n\nThe point being that anytime a new bull market is established, volatility doesn't suddenly disappear.\n\n## There are fundamental reasons supportive of a correction or crash\n\nOne of the weird  quirks about Wall Street and the stock market is that it's always  forward-looking. It's almost always the case that equities bottom out  well before the U.S. economy hits its trough. But there's little denying  how wide the gap is between Wall Street and Main Street at the moment,  which leads to a strong likelihood of an eventual downside in equities.\n\nAside from the  fact that historical data shows a crash or correction to be highly  likely within three years of a new bull market beginning, perhaps the [biggest fundamental threat to the U.S. economy](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/14/opinion-stock-market-crash-round-2-is-coming.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=19b6aa15-b6be-4dd3-a2a1-5723d6f74c1a) is the upcoming end of certain aspects of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act, for short).\n\nWhen the [CARES Act](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/14/8-highlights-of-the-cares-act-you-should-know.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=19b6aa15-b6be-4dd3-a2a1-5723d6f74c1a)  was passed in late March, it apportioned $260 billion to expand the  unemployment benefits program. This expansion entailed sending approved  beneficiaries $600 extra a week for up to four months. But this extra  $600 a week is set to end July 31. As of May 23, there were almost 21.5  million continuing claims (i.e., people receiving unemployment  benefits), per the U.S. Employment and Training Administration, which  suggests that the economy is nowhere near healthy. When these benefits  stop, it's a near certainty that, without additional stimulus, we'll see  a dramatic increase in rental, mortgage, and loan delinquencies.\u00a0\n\nIt's also not  unreasonable to expect the U.S. economy to ramp up slowly throughout the  remainder of June and into the third quarter. As we've witnessed from  the opening of nonessential businesses throughout most of the country,  many are not functioning at full capacity, and consumers are still far  too scared to part with their cash. In April, the personal saving rate  in the U.S. hit 33%, which is nearly double the all-time record of 17.3%  set in May 1975, shortly after the oil embargo. If people aren't  spending in a consumption-driven economy, that's a bad sign.\u00a0\n\n## Here's what smart investors do when the stock market crashes or corrects\n\nIf the historical  data suggests that some form of correction is likely coming, and the  economic data appears to concur, you might be thinking that the best  thing to do is tuck your tail between your legs and run for the hills.  But that's [not what smart investors will be doing](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/06/yes-another-stock-market-crash-is-coming-how-to-be.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=19b6aa15-b6be-4dd3-a2a1-5723d6f74c1a).\n\nThe first thing  to do when the stock market corrects (aside from realizing that  corrections are a normal part of the investing cycle) is to [review your initial investment theses](https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/11/21/stock-market-corrections-11-things-you-should-know.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=19b6aa15-b6be-4dd3-a2a1-5723d6f74c1a)  throughout your portfolio. You'll find that, more often than not, the  reasons you've bought into a company haven't changed just because  investor sentiment has been temporary hijacked by the latest worry. It  rarely makes sense to sell great companies during periods of panic.\n\nThe next thing to  do is ensure you have dry powder at the ready. Billionaire investing  mogul Warren Buffett, who's been the CEO of conglomerate **Berkshire Hathaway** (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B)  for more than five decades, has always been a strong believer in having  a healthy cash position for periods of panic and fear. In fact, Buffett  can't even [repurchase Berkshire Hathaway stock](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/05/06/the-1-stock-warren-buffett-cant-stop-buying.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=19b6aa15-b6be-4dd3-a2a1-5723d6f74c1a) unless both he and his right-hand man Charlie Munger agree it's intrinsically cheap *and*  Berkshire Hathaway has at least $20 billion in cash, cash equivalents,  and marketable securities at its disposal. Buffett has historically made  some of his best investments during stock market corrections and  crashes, which should incentivize you to always have some cash at the  ready for investment.\n\nLastly, take a deep breath. Despite undergoing 38 official corrections over the past 70 years, the S&P 500 [has put 37 of those corrections firmly in the rearview mirror](https://www.fool.com/investing/2019/06/05/how-often-is-buying-into-a-stock-market-correction.aspx?utm_source=nasdaq&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=19b6aa15-b6be-4dd3-a2a1-5723d6f74c1a). Eventually, the same will be true for the COVID-19 crash.\n\nAlthough a correction or crash may be inevitable, that's no reason to deviate from a successful buy-and-hold strategy.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "h0e6xv", "created_utc": 1591805983.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "NASDAQ didn't say this.. it just wants clickbait for ad revenue as well.  \n\nIt's an opinion piece from Motley Fool posted on their site.\n\n*The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.*", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5418258905410767}, {"body": "If the market actually does crash, holy shit I'm going shopping.", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": ["crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "A few weeks ago I was 50% in cash.
