{"title": "Up 800% in the last 5 weeks trading only calendar spreads", "selftext": "Last month performance:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/Hd1mbYJ\n\nGraph starts at -$481, but my bottom was about a week before that at -$934 since I withdrew $1500 before taking the screenshot. The huge drop is from holding illiquid BBBY calendar spreads that displayed inaccurate values after market closing.\n\nPositions:\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/MuqKctd\n\nStarted trading options in January, literally a month before a giant market crash (lol). I made some money on airline puts but held through the recovery and I was down more than 90% after losing more than $10,000 on puts betting against JPow, was down to about $500. I'd had some good success with calendar spreads in the past so I ditched long options completely. So far I've finished plays on 10 companies and I've profited on all of them except one (fuck you WORK). Made my way up to about $3500, withdrew $1500 to pay some bills. I'm still down 70% from my starting deposit, so I've got aways to go before breaking even on my all-time graph.\n\nCurrently sitting on a bunch of JPM put debit spreads that I picked up at Friday close and some PEP calendar spreads (tried to close these before closing but couldn't get them filled at my exit price, gonna just hold through earnings).\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/pbbMeb7\n\nThis is kinda the crazy part: in the last 29 trading days, I've only had TWO red days (not counting the funky days holding illiquid BBBY spreads that don't accurately display my portfolio value). Calendar spreads are theta positive, so as long as the UL stays close to my strike, I almost always make money. Initially, I held most of my calendar spreads through earnings reports. Normally calendars lose value when IV decreases, but I've actually been able to grab huge profits from this strat because the short leg in the spread will always have a higher IV than the long leg right before the ER, so the IV crush will hit that short leg harder. In addition, I've mostly had success predicting the direction of the UL after the ER by setting my strike below or above the UL price before ER, and profiting when it moves towards that strike. The only time this hasn't worked was when WORK had a massive 20% drop post ER that destroyed my portfolio. Since then I've been a bit more careful about holding through ER and recently I've been closing most of my calendars the day before ER if decent profits are there.\n\nI've also started branching into more complex spreads to better play these ERs. So far I've started vertical spreads, double or triple calendars, and I'm planning on using ICs and butterflies as well. The kangaroo market has presented a perfect opportunity to play neutral strats on mid-cap companies that haven't been mooning like big tech. Would I have made more money if I had just gone long calls on tech a month ago? Perhaps, but personally I find my strat to be safer, especially since I expect the overall market to keep moving relatively flat for the next few months until the election gets closer. Next goal is to reach my AT break-even at around $6800!", "id": "hp2qe1", "created_utc": 1594436407.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is the unemployment line.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The value of this short gave it the dubious distinction of being the largest short ever recorded against a single stock. At the same time, this gave the wsbtards the illusion that there are still huge short interest in the stock and in true WSB fashion, implied \"massive upside\" on the stock.\n\nThe true however is that the short interest is actually declining with short interest at a 18 month low of less than 15 million shares compared to 45 million at the peak around August last year. The only reason why there is \"record short\" on the stock is due to the massive increase in stock price lately. This however is not the contrarian indicator you are looking for.
