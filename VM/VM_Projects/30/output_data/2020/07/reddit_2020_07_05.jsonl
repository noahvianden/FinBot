Any good/recent threads on this, let me know. \n\nI\u2019ve made just over $600 in the time being, and currently averaging 3.46% weekly returns. Is this sustainable?

For these two in particular, I was seeing 9% a week for short durations. Haven\u2019t seen a big loss yet, less than $9 loss one week. I\u2019ve buying back contracts if I see the stock turning away, I am not interested in assignment, or cash secured calls.\n\nI guess I am asking, anyone with a similar strategy? For how long? What\u2019s your account look like, weekly/annual ROI?\n\n\nEDIT: thanks for the conversation, I appreciate the info. Looks like it\u2019s not exactly scalable or as profitable in the long term.
