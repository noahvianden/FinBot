I believe in these companies and wanted to keep these stocks long term. I started writing covered call in these companies earlier this year since CC is touted as an \"income generating strategy\". However, this is when I realized that CC isn't that great of a strategy and severely caps your upside potential for growth stocks. \n\nThe way some of these stocks **mooned**, it busted my covered calls. I tried to defend those short calls as much as I could. I rolled them out and up, out and up, and so on till the point that I'm out to January next year. Even after that, my short calls have gone deep in the money. I can't keep rolling out and up  indefinitely since the deeper the short call goes ITM, the more difficult it becomes to roll it out for a credit big enough to roll up. \n\nOn the other hand, CC is doing well for stocks like CSCO, MU and T. These stocks didn't moon. I'm slightly positive on these stocks and CCs are also supplementing to the overall returns. But these stocks won't probably ever moon, so what's the point of holding them if your overall goal is to ride the wave on the growth stocks. These are kind of safe haven, low beta stocks. \n\nSo I guess the takeaway for this is -\n\n1. Don't write covered calls on growth stocks that have potential to moon if you want to hang on to them.\n2. If you do write CCs on growth stocks, then don't roll out.
