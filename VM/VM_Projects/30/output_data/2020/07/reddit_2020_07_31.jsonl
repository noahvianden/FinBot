{"title": "AAPL split will be a juicy wheel target", "selftext": "#TLDR:  The Apple stock split will lead to a large increase in volume for Apple stock and options, especially on the calls from freshly minted RH users.  Sell your puts and then sell your calls.\n\nI've been thinking about what is behind the Apple stock split.  Who is behind it, and what are they after.  Most importantly, how can I ride their coattails and gleam something for the family. In the end, the why and what end doesn't matter as much as what am I going to do.\n\nI present 3 ideas:\n\n1. AAPL is already the top traded stock on Robinhood.  https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/most-popular-robinhood-stocks?slide=7\n\n2. Robinhood is the easiest way for anyone with a smartphone to get into trading.  https://www.wsj.com/articles/everyones-a-day-trader-now-11595649609\n\n3. Robinhood traders are orders of magnitude more likely to trade options than any other platform users, and they know less about them. https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/technology/robinhood-risky-trading.html\n\nWith these three thoughts, I believe $100 AAPL shares will bring an explosive growth in the volume of call purchases by RH users, likely drawing in other platforms as the FOMO takes over.  However, RH users can't afford anything else in tech for long.  And when they start to learn about OTM call buying being a bad play, the will look at ~$100 stocks to begin learning spreads.  Intel  (poor outlook but solid base), AMD (great outlook), TWTR (?), Disney (included for price and name recognition).\n\nCompared to all of these, AAPL is a goldmine.  Except maybe AMD.  AMD looks like it will have the next decade in the sun as Intel suffers from complacency from 2007-2017.\n\nAt $10,000 entry, it's a little steep for a junior theta-banger, but much more accessible than the $400/share.\n\nI wouldn't buy AAPL outright yet.  I believe the run-up to the split is designed to allow for [bigboy profit taking.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0x1y7/where_is_aapl_going_after_the_split/)  I'll think about selling $97.5 puts and then slowly inch that up.", "id": "i1bkvn", "created_utc": 1596216277.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "I've been pouting because I have mustered up 53 shares of apple over my trading career, just waiting until I've made enough gains to sell covered calls.

In that case, the primary qualification of the new engineer would not be her ability to lead a complicated, difficult turnaround; it would be her second X chromosome and her ability to advocate on behalf of other people whose primary qualification was their second X chromosome.  That kind of cultural turnaround, while ultimately probably the right thing to do, is hard enough to execute at the best of times, never mind when there is a giant Moore's-law technical failure elephant in the room that hasn't been addressed for 10 years.  Companies do this kind of deck-chair rearranging while the ship is sinking so often that the minority/female leadership position has a name, it's called the '[glass cliff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_cliff)' because the hapless underrepresented candidate is thrown into shark-infested waters that he or she has literally no chance of navigating.

{"title": "BECKY has changed", "selftext": "When you start spending time with BECKY, you learn things about her. They're cute at first. The anything-but-actual-coffee purchases from SBUX. The anything-her-other-boyfriend-will-buy-her purchases from TGT. Then things change. She gets a third boyfriend. COVID hits. Her friends start spending money elsewhere. Autists, it's time to talk about BECKY. She's changed. Let's talk about what tickers still make sense, what should be added, and what should be dropped. Much of this is based on where I see my girlfriend and her friends spending their money during ongoing quarantine, and what products are being advertised on the TV shows they stream.\n\nSBUX - Ambivalent. This is a good recovery stock, but remember that a lot of their money came from everything-but-coffee. Sadly, many of the replacements (sipsby.com) are not publicly traded. Consider Unilever (UL) as an alternate. They own Tazo, Lipton, Ben  & Jerry's, Breyer's, Klondike - basically a long list of tea and ice cream, among other random stuff. PEP is also a decent alternative; they're making a killing from Bubly and La Croix.\n\nTGT - They offer curbside delivery. TGT is a stronger BECKY stock than ever.\n\nDECK - On hold. There's not as much \"dress up and go out\" happening. This is where a lot of people are saving money; sometimes they'll put on makeup and dress up for a special date night that is still just a night in. Expect shoe sales to be down. \n\nLULU - Stronger than ever. Yoga pants are the default \"I don't want to wear pants while working from home\" pants. My girlfriend tried buying cheaper yoga pants but she didn't like them and went back to name-brand.\n\nPINS - Still in. Duh.\n\nW - Wayfair is going to keep going up. Spending time at home results in new light fixtures, curtains, work-from-home furniture, etc. Wayfair is the alternative to shopping at Ikea (why is it people will only shop at Ikea in person? No one uses their website except to try and look up what their friends spent on the latest thing they bought from an Ikea store.)\n\nCHWY - Girls all have cats now. All of them, including the ones that have dogs. Chewy has decent prices on good litter, food, etc and they ship right to your door. \n\nI'm sure that I am missing some.
