{"title": "Hyliion: The REAL TSLA/NKLA killer - at least in the trucking industry", "selftext": "Hyliion (future ticker HYLN) should be IPOing via reverse merger sometime within Q3. Hyliion makes electric power trains for semi-trucks and their system fits in existing OEMs so trucking companies don't have to buy an entire new truck and retrain the drivers like with TSLA or NKLA.\n\nThe current version runs on renewable natural gas (recycling farm and landfill waste, reducing overall methane and carbon emissions to negative levels), and the next generation Hypertruck ERX that should be released in 2021 will be fuel agnostic and also able to run on hydrogen.\n\nThis is an important IPO because unlike Tesla and Nikola, the Hyliion power train not only helps the environment but actually saves trucking companies money over traditional diesel over the lifetime of the truck - it pays for itself in less than two years, after which every year it saves up to $20K in gas. Not only that - it goes 2-4x further and fills 3x faster (1300 miles per 10 minute renewable natural gas fill) than the Tesla semi (300-500 miles per 30 minute charge.)\n\nHere is a price comparison of cost of 7 year ownership:\n\n* Traditional Diesel - $431,850\n* Hyliion Hybrid Electric (current version) - $404,493 (6% savings vs. diesel)\n* Hyliion Hypertruck ERX (next gen coming 2021) - $279,776 (35% savings vs. diesel)\n* Tesla Semi - $438,000 (costs 1% more than diesel)\n* Nikola - $637,500 (costs 48% more than diesel)\n\nThe Hyliion Hypertruck ERX also is the only one that gets better 7-year total payload than diesel - gaining $35,000 worth of payload capacity, while Tesla loses $140k and Nikola loses $52.5K in payload capacity.\n\nGiven the drastic cost savings relative to traditional diesel, much less their even more expensive and worse performing electric semi-truck rivals, Hyliion has the opportunity to be a game changer in the trucking industry, saving both money and the environment at the same time. Other than a higher upfront cost than traditional diesel, there is no real disincentive for the trucking industry to convert to Hyliion power trains.\n\nThis will make it harder for Tesla and Nikola to compete outside of niche appeal - it is a luxury in an industry on slim margins that cares about the bottom line. Once Tesla gets their semi truck driving fully autonomously will it have a bigger advantage, but until then Hyliion should win the next decade.", "id": "hswxle", "created_utc": 1594997186.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.75, "num_comments": 35, "comments": [{"body": "Soooo when can I buy it is the real question?", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.014417422004044056}, {"body": "Around Dec 1st 2020 is the earliest HYLN will trade, but it could take longer.

{"title": "Staying Sane and a Few Thoughts on TSLA", "selftext": "Remarkably this crowd seems quite thoughtful, so I wanted to post a bit of what I feel is general good advice mixed in with hopefully informed opinions.  This has been a pretty crazy run-up in a company that we obviously believe in, and believe in several ways viz. financial / environmental / practical.\n\nReading the Fun Thread there are some pretty nutty posts.  I get that most are in jest or exaggerated reality.  Like many of you, I have made some life-changing money by concentrating a portfolio and doing some well-timed plays.\n\n**HOWEVER... my sincere advice:**\n\nStay sane.  This means that if you make five, six, or seven figures, don't do anything rash.  If you lose five, six, or seven figures, don't do anything rash.  This is a volatile time for many reasons and wait for things to stabilize before you even count your chickens!  Keep a long term perspective on investing and you will do ok regardless of short term gains or losses.  If you really can't take the gyrations, just lower your % invested or look into some protective option plays.  Keep a level head IRL also, you're still the same person.\n\nInvest in yourself in addition to TSLA and stocks.  Especially if young - I spent most of my youth getting a medical degree - think of this as the ultimate hedge and dividend producing play.  Of course I would have loved to strike it rich early, but it was not needed for a healthy and wonderful life.\n\nRegarding investing of time, early self-investment allows a more interesting future, even if you are able to attain FIRE.  I could run a free clinic, if you are a teacher you can volunteer or start a program, if a musician can fully put yourself into craft.  If you don't do these things a bit early, they are still possible, but more difficult.\n\n**Don't waste formative years hitting F5 at the expense of developing yourself.**\n\nTake a long term view.  In life and in stocks.  People that bought TSLA at 1600 and are mad it is now 1500, well that is silly.  It really doesn't matter how much AMZN you would have bough at 300 vs 280 per share.  It doesn't matter that much and it is near impossible to time the market consistently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk this came across as much more preachy than I wanted, but some of it was advise to myself, particularly the staying sane during wild gyrations of personal funds, as we head into earnings.\n\nGO TSLA.", "id": "hso8ne", "created_utc": 1594955617.0, "score": 139, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "Good advice, doc", "score": 39, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22718152403831482}, {"body": "Nice!\n\nMy sanity is maintained by the awesome folks conversing here.

The first video that really resonated with me was [Dave's Exit Plan](https://youtu.be/r9HtG-jJSTY), the video is only ~5 months old. This completely changed my mindset towards investing. Dave (over many videos) discusses really thought provoking investing techniques.\n\nThen, quite recently, I came across Chicken Genius Singapore, also thanks to this sub.

{"title": "How I learned to stop worrying and love the bubble, A conversation for 'tards, by 'tards.", "selftext": "With the sub split roughly down the middle regarding a tech bubble, I thought we should have a conversation about it.\n\nPopular convention seems to be that bubbles can't be seen by their nature.  I'm of the mind that that sentiment is horseshit.\n\nI would suggest that even bubble I've been able to find data about has followed a \"Ziphian\" trajectory, or roughly an exponential curve on the way up and most of the time unwinding in the exact same way.\n\nI think there is a social reason behind this, once the barrier to entry is sufficiently lowered, people tend to pile into trends at a roughly predictable curve.  That is, in a reverse Ziph fashion.\n\nOne tells two and those two tell 4 and so on.\n\nNow, I want to be clear that I am not a mathematical guy, my education trends more along sociology than numbers, but I think the market in a bubble is more sociology based, anyway.  In fact that's what I would define as a bubble.  A moment where cultural sentiment decouples from underlying fundamentals, a transfer from brain to feelings.\n\nI made a picture with crayons, my wife is very proud, it's on the fridge.  \n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/jB8L3qz.jpg\n\nThe fist trend line is famous.

While bubbles seem to be difficult to identify during the formation period, they always peak with a nearly vertical line up at the very end.\n\n3. We may now be in a bubble, but COVID makes the analysis of this difficult.  Was this just the fastest recovery in the history of the market, or was it something more sinister?  Is the trend line of QQQ the nearly vertical line that indicates the pop is imminent?\n\nI'd love you guys to tear this apart.
