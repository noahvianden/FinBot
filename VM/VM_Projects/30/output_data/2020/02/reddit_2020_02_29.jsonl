{"title": "A Serious Discussion About Corona-Related Conversation", "selftext": "**Note: This is a serious discussion and not an argument. Be mindful to others.**\n\nAs the topic of the Corona virus becomes popular online and on the news, it is expected that more and more discussion will take place. With that being said, a decision has to be made as to what will be allowed to be posted in r/teslainvestorsclub. The Corona virus could be a hot topic for months to come and surely the faster this is established the better.\n\nBefore a decision is made as to what we allow in the subreddit, I want to go on record and say when I accepted the position as a moderator it was made clear the community would be ran with two things in mind:\n\n1. First and foremost, this online community was created for the community, regardless of your stance. To me, it does not matter what your stance on TSLA or world events is, as you should and will be allowed to voice your opinion so long as they abide the rules.\n2. As referred to above, there are six rules that are expected to be followed. These rules can be found in the sidebar and, if followed, create a safe and welcoming environment to all who visit and contribute.\n\nAs per the first numbered point above, I do my best to remain unbiased when moderating here and notice that other active moderators do a great job at handling issues without bias. Whether you are bear or bull, I make it a point to stick to decisions governed by the rules. As per the second numbered point above, this is where it gets messy.\n\nRule 3 states that posts must be about investing in Tesla and goes further into detail by stating \"posts which are not directly related must have relation in the form of a question or comparison\". Some will argue that the virus is a macro issue and thus is related to Tesla, while others claim that relation is widespread and not **directly** related. Personally, I agree with the latter. There are dedicated communities like r/worldnews who currently have a [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/14d816ty1ylvo/) of updates on the virus. Not only does posting here flood the daily comments, but there are sources in the linked above discussion about COVID-19 that produce reliable and accurate information. Above all else, if you are going to collect and spread information please get it from a dedicated factual source.\n\n# What I am suggesting\n\nI am suggesting that going forward, we disengage from broad conversation regarding the Corona virus and keep it to a **focused** topic involving Tesla. This suggestion sprouts from a few deciding factors including the official rule (rule 3) interpretation as well as the high volume of non-company related comments that deal with the virus. Comments that are loosely tied to the company through macro events should be dis-encouraged (i.e. the Pope's test results and Country activity). With that being said, comments/posts involving the company directly are encouraged (i.e. supply chains and California's first case being miles from Fremont).\n\nAs some of you may have heard, r/teslainvestorsclub lost one of their most active moderators, and although the other moderators here do a fantastic job, it is hard to keep up with the increased volume of comments. This subreddit is growing and will soon surpass 15,000 subscribers. I am proposing, with the agreeance of the community and other moderators, that we return to focused discussion that many come here to contribute and read. If you want to discuss the virus at large please visit r/WorldNews and r/CoronaVirus. If you find Tesla relevant information from a reliable source, please share with the community!\n\nPlease use the area below to discuss what you would like to see with this week going forward. **Moderators, please distinguish your initial comments within the thread.** The Corona virus may be a hot topic for months to come and deciding on how we approach the conversation in this subreddit sooner than later would save time and efforts.\n\nThank you all for contributing.", "id": "fbhas6", "created_utc": 1583003086.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "I agree that top level posts should reserved for Direct Tesla relation. \n\nThe pandemic affects Tesla both directly (factory output) and indirectly (macro environment), and in my opinion deserves to be the topic of many conversations in this subreddit.

The virus is the hot topic in this subreddit the last 6 days because the market collapsed the fastest in 12 years and took Tesla with it. Extrapolating that because the effects of the virus will last for months so the conversation will be dominated by it for months is a bad prediction. When it ceases to be the main driver of the stock it will cease to be the main conversation. And later in the year the election will be more commonly discussed.\n\nThere's some strange impulse driving this need to censor this. It has been 6 days but TeamHume was striking to shut it down in the first couple. Why the assumption that people have lost sight of this being a Tesla forum? All conversation related to the virus is as related to Tesla as conversation on this sub ever is directly to Tesla. Let's recall that the overall quality of this sub isn't that high to start with, where there is a high percentage of not particularly interesting or related commentary, so there isn't an average deterioration in effect. I suspect the intention to censor is simply a desire to hear only good news frankly, but that's just a guess. the most perenially bullish seem the most interested in denying the significance.\n\nCertainly there are gradations of \\*quality\\* and how well any comment is attached to an impact on Tesla specifically, but that's always the case and the same basic principals can be expounded. Also this is the Tesla investors club, not the general fan sub, any issue that clearly affects the stock is basically fair game imo. If some dude thought brexit was a huge deal and wouldn't shut up about it then that should be suppressed because reasonable people know that would have minimal impact.

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 2nd, 2020", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week and month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 2nd, 2020.\n\n# **Stock rout may deepen in the week ahead as coronavirus impact starts to show up in economic data  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/stock-rout-to-deepen-as-coronavirus-impact-starts-to-show-up-in-data.html)**\n*****\n> Stock investors just experienced one of the nastiest weeks in history that recorded the S&P 500\u2032s fastest correction on record, but hold on tight, the market might have more room to fall as the coronavirus damage starts to creep into upcoming economic data, analysts warned.\n*****\n> Major U.S. stock averages suffered their worst week since the financial crisis as fears about the coronavirus disrupting the global economy scared investors away from risk assets. However, stocks might still be searching for a bottom next week when investors grapple with a slew of economic data potentially dragged down by the outbreak.\n*****\n> The Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing gauge on Monday. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will publish its latest Beige Book on Wednesday, which will detail anecdotal information on current economic conditions. Many expect U.S. manufacturing to have taken a hit from the coronavirus.\n*****\n> \u201cLook out for ISM surveys and Beige Book for early signs of COVID-19 impact,\u201d Michelle Meyer, Bank of America\u2019s head of U.S. economics, said in a note Friday. \u201cIt will take time for the \u2018hard\u2019 economic data to show the impact but we are already seeing evidence in early economic indicators.\u201d\n*****\n> Weekend action?\n> The outlook for the week could be changed this weekend by coronavirus headlines or by some sort of intervention by central banks. Expectations are rising on Wall Street that there could be some potential move from the Federal Reserve to get ahead of what could be another rough week.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank is monitoring the coronavirus and pledged action if necessary. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh recommended the Fed act as quickly as Sunday before the markets reopen. The market is already pricing in a 100% chance of at least one rate cut at the Fed\u2019s March policy meeting.\n*****\n> Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, is worried about the cascading effect of coronavirus hitting upcoming economic data points. \u201cISM manufacturing is going to be widely scrutinized,\u201d he said.\n*****\n> The ISM manufacturing index rose to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July (Any reading above 50 signals expansion.) Bank of America expects ISM manufacturing to pull back to 50.0 and said Fed Beige Book may provide \u201cearly insight\u201d into the U.S. economic impact from the deadly virus.\n*****\n> Cutting forecasts\n> Next week, investors will also likely grapple with more warnings from major companies about broken supply chains and easing demand due to the outbreak.\n*****\n> Apple, Microsoft, Nike and United Airlines have all sounded alarms that they will not meet their earnings and revenue guidance because of the virus.\n*****\n> Wall Street strategists this week were quick to slash their forecasts on corporate earnings and the stock market. Barclays sees the S&P 500 to end the year at 3,000, down from a previous forecast of 3,300. The bank also expects a 2% drop in profits this year. Meanwhile, Goldman said it sees zero earnings growth for American companies in 2020.\n*****\n> To be sure, some believe the steep stock rout has gone too far too fast, betting on at least a small rebound.\n*****\n> \u201cThe level of panic has become very extreme and the level of downside price movement is pretty extreme. All of that is to me more of a sign that we are getting closer to the beginning of the end of it,\u201d Paulsen said.\n*****\n> Another source of support could come from the Trump administration, where officials are discussing tax cuts, among other economic reactions, as one option to make up for the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Washington Post reported Friday.\n*****\n> Still, investors will have to be on edge for a while now with more virus headlines, as well as the key Super Tuesday Democratic primaries. Some notable investors including \u201cbond king\u201d Jeffrey Gundlach blamed the rise of Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders for helping accelerate massive sell-off.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xxV96kn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3XfCFrl.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/zbhTBQr.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zASmUSl.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wv7Xef1.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qPOD5uN.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2z1n5iA.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jgqhUBR.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j7kavSk.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4awCCsW.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ElXoU2T.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xH2GYRk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/HyXxrSJ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/GIw7Oq6.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gauging Potential Economic Impact of Covid-19\n\n> The coronavirus outbreak\u2014or Covid-19 \u2014has caused significant market volatility over the past week. Our approach as always is to focus on economic fundamentals first, but the uncertainty around the scope of the outbreak has made it very difficult to assess potential impact. The situation clearly is unsettling for investors as more cases are reported across Europe and Asia, and the first case of community transmission has been reported in the United States. As this was written, the S&P 500 Index was 10% below its February 19 all-time high.\n\n> \u201cThe Covid-19 outbreak continues to significantly disrupt economic activity in China and throughout Asia,\u201d said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. \u201cGiven that China is such a big component of many global supply chains, we will almost certainly see weaker economic data globally over the next several months.\u201d\n\n> Even as the situation remains fluid and very uncertain, we want to provide some sense of the potential U.S. and global economic impact.\n\n> **China**: If virus containment holds in China, which is our base case, we could see something like a 3\u20134 percentage point impact to Chinese economic growth in the first quarter\u2014possibly 2\u20133% gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than 5\u20136%\u2014followed by a much more modest hit in the second quarter. We think we would see a return to trend growth by the third quarter of 2020. This scenario would put China\u2019s 2020 GDP growth below the current 5.6% Bloomberg-tracked consensus, shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, and the Chinese government\u2019s previous 6% annual target. In other words, China\u2019s GDP growth in 2020 could end up closer to 5% than 6%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> United States: At this point, our base case is that any economic disruption in the United States may be modest and short-lived, as we expect domestic efforts at containment to be more successful and have less economic disruption than in China. The outbreak may trim 0.25\u20130.5% from U.S. GDP over the next couple of months due to global supply chain disruption, falling export demand, and decreased tourism. If evidence emerges over the next month or so that the virus is being contained successfully, as we expect, the economic impact would likely be at the better end of that range (0.25%). In that scenario, damage to business and consumer confidence would be limited, setting the stage for a potential second-quarter rebound. We believe our 1.75% U.S. GDP growth forecast may still be achievable.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> **Global**: In the short-term, the collective hits to global GDP from China, South Korea, Japan, and Italy\u2014the countries where the outbreak impact has been greatest to date\u2014may comprise 0.2\u20130.3% of global GDP. Our latest global GDP forecast of 3.5% from our Outlook 2020 publication is probably a bit too high in light of the latest news. We expect to update or reaffirm our economic forecasts once we have more clarity around Covid-19 impact in the weeks ahead.\n\n*****\n\n# Can the Market Bottom on a Friday?\n\n> It's often said that equity markets can't bottom on a Friday. One of the reasons for this line of thinking is that during a market downturn, no one wants to hold onto or bid up equities into a weekend for fear of further bad news. It may just be a matter of semantics, but based on that line of reasoning, the more accurate way to phrase it would be that markets can't bottom on a Thursday or rallies can't begin on a Friday. However you want to think about it, the chart below shows the number of times the closing low of a 10%+ correction has occurred on various weekdays.\n\n> Of the 97 S&P 500 corrections since 1928, the day of the week that has marked the low close of a 10%+ decline the least frequently is actually Wednesday with only 10. Behind Wednesday, Friday has been the second most infrequent day of the week for a bottom (15), and Thursday is the only other day of the week where the S&P 500 has made a low on a closing basis less than 20 times. The days of the week where the S&P 500 most frequently bottoms are Monday and Tuesday with 26 and 28, respectively.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-10-Corrections.png))**\n\n> Regarding bear markets (20%+ declines), the trend is very similar. Bear markets have been the least likely to end on a Wednesday or Friday and most likely to end on a Tuesday.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-Bear-Markets.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dividend Stock Spotlight: S&P 500's Highest Yielders From The Sell-Off\n\n> Given the lower prices of stocks, dividend yields have been on the rise over the past couple of weeks. The dividend yield of the S&P 500 now stands at 2.12% which is the highest since June 3rd of last year when it reached the same level, but only stayed there for a single day. Prior to that, yields were only higher during the Q4 2018 sell-off through February of 2019. At the beginning of the current sell-off on February 19th, the S&P 500's yield was 26 bps lower at 1.86%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Div-yield-sp.png))**\n\n> Of the individual stocks in the index, there are now 81 stocks that have dividend yields of 4% or more. That compares to only 64 at the beginning of the sell-off. In the table below, we show the 25 highest yielders of the S&P 500 as well as the price change and change in the dividend yield since the 2/19 record high. As shown, there is only one stock, Macy's (M), that yields over 10% at the moment. This major retailer has fallen out of favor in the past few years but the stock has gotten crushed since the 2/19 market peak having fallen just under 21% in that time. That decline has raised the dividend yield by 2.44 percentage points, but there is one other stock that has seen its yield increase by even more. That stock is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the second-highest yielder in the index (9.93%). Being an Energy name, OXY has fallen the most dramatically (-29.05%) since 2/19 of all the highest yielders.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Highest-Yielding-table1.png))**\n\n> While there is a lot of overlap, in the table below we show the stocks that have seen their dividend yields rise the most as stocks have declined since 2/19. Again OXY and M top the list. While no other stocks have seen their dividend yields increase by more than 2 percentage points, there are another 17 who have risen by at least 1 percentage point. Notably, two cruise line stocks, Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) find themselves on this list. Carnival (CCL) now yields 6.28% while Royal Caribbean (RCL) yields 4.05%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Biggest-Change-yield-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Biggest Losers (and a few winners)\n\n> It is no secret that energy stocks have gotten crushed this year, and the list of the 25 worst-performing stocks in the Russell 1000 since the previous record close on February 19th is a prime example of this. Seven energy stocks find themselves on this list, two of which, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Kosmos Energy (KOS), take up the number one and two spots having fallen 45.73% and 41.95%, respectively since 2/19. CHK had already been weak headed into the broader market sell-off with a YTD loss on 2/19 over 40%; the past week has added fuel to the fire as it is now down 68.5% YTD. Continental (CLR), Centennial Resource Development (CDEV), Transocean (RIG), and Apergy (APY) are other energy stocks that were down 20% or more on the year headed into this sell-off, and each one has fallen another 20%+ since the 19th. While most of the other biggest losers since 2/19 had already been down on the year, there are some that have seen their gains in 2020 get erased due to this sell-off like Nutanix (NTNX), Qurate Retail (QRTEA), Anaplan (PLAN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Chemours (CC), and CommScope (COMM). Some other notable losers of this group have been those heavily reliant on travel like American Airlines (AAL) and the cruise line stocks like Norwegian (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Worst.png))**\n\n> Given how breadth has been over the past week, it may not come as any surprise that since the February 19th high there are only 18 stocks of 1000 in the Russell 1000 index that are higher. Four of those are up less than one percent. In the table below we show all of these stocks. Given the sell-off has centered around coronavirus fears, it is sensical that a coronavirus vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) is the best performing stock since 2/19. What is amazing is there was not much momentum with this name headed into the sell-off. As of 2/19, the stock was actually down 3.27% year to date, but as the Covid-19 saga has moved along it is now up well north of 30% on the year. A few other health care names like Regeneron (REGN) and Gilead (GILD) have also benefited from the coronavirus.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Best.png))**\n\n> The histogram below shows the distribution of performance of Russell 1000 stocks since 2/19. As mentioned above, there are very few stocks in the index that are up since the 2/19 high. The highest share of stocks are down between 10% and 15% while the next highest share are down between 5% and 10%. Of the worst decliners, there are 75 stocks that have fallen over 20%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/hist.png))**\n\n> Looking at the individual sectors, again Energy was extremely weak even before equities sold off. On 2/19, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1000 in that sector was down 15.6% YTD. While they hadn't tipped into the red yet, Consumer Staples were only up 1 bp.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/YTD-of-219.png))**\n\n> Since the 2/19 high for the US equity market, the average stock in the Russell 1,000 is down well over 10%. The average Energy stock is down the most at -21%, followed by Communication Services and Technology at -13%. Consumer Staples stocks have performed the best with an average decline of 8.9%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Since-219.png))**\n\n> This leaves every sector down year-to-date. Utilities have generally outperformed only falling 2.3%, but the sector is sitting on a loss nonetheless. Of the worst sectors, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, and of course Energy have fallen 10% or more.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RIY-CYTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equity Benchmarks Distance From YTD Highs\n\n> The recent equity sell-off has clearly been global in nature as concerns of a global pandemic rise. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the way equities have sold off recently is that the country that has been hardest hit by the virus is closer to its YTD high than any other major global equity benchmark. The chart below shows the distance that each major global equity benchmark has declined relative to its YTD high. China's Shanghai Composite is down just 4.45%, which is better than any other country shown. Sure, you could argue that the Chinese government is manipulating the market and prohibiting investors from selling, but even the ETF that tracks the CSI 300 (ASHR) is down less than 6%, so anyone could go in and trade at these levels. Manipulated or not, the numbers are the numbers.\n\n> At the bottom of the list, Brazil's Ibovespa index is down more than any other country at 11.6% and that country has only reported one confirmed case so far. With respect to US indices, the Russell 2000 is down the second most of any major global benchmark (-9.19%), while the Nasdaq is down the fourth most at 8.68%. Even the S&P 500 is down close to 8%. These weak US readings come in a backdrop where there have only been 57 confirmed cases and all but a couple are instances where Americans contracted the virus outside of the United States and have been brought to the US under quarantine.

Since WWII, there have only been four other weeks where the S&P 500 was down more than 10% in a given week. On a related note, there are also only four stocks in the entire S&P 500 that are positive for the week! Leading the way higher, Regeneron (REGN) is up a healthy 7.1% while Gilead (GILD) is up just over 4%. Behind these two, the only other stocks that are higher now than they were at last Friday's close are Clorox (CLX) and CME Group (CME).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Gainers.png))**\n\n> On the downside, there are a lot more losers, but in the interest of space, below we have only listed the 17 stocks in the S&P 500 that are down over 20% this week alone. Looking through the names on the list, the cruise lines are well represented with Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Besides these names, American Airlines (AAL) is down 26%, while Live Nation (LYV) is down 22.2%.\n\n> One thing we've heard a number of people argue the last few days is that some of the weakness this week is related to the increasing likelihood that Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. If that's the case, why is not a single one of the worst-performing stocks from the Health Care sector, and why is the Health Care sector the third best performing sector this week and one of just four that is not down 10% so far this week?\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Decliners.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$TGT** \n> * **$PLUG** \n> * **$JD** \n> * **$ZM** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$TLRY** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$KSS** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$XRAY** \n> * **$SE** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$FOLD** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$STNE** \n> * **$BLDP** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$ALBO** \n> * **$MAXR** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$ITCI** \n> * **$FNKO** \n> * **$JWN** \n> * **$EPRT** \n> * **$VIPS** \n> * **$GTT** \n> * **$CORE** \n> * **$BNFT** \n> * **$LVGO** \n> * **$EVRG** \n> * **$ROST** \n> * **$EGRX** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$TGLS** \n> * **$ATRS** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$NWN** \n> * **$WVE** \n> * **$WSC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/j7kavSk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/x29nduD.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 3.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WpXhdqA.png))\n\n\n> # ***Monday 3.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ycdhPpa.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.3.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VIBwP3J.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0CU1CX3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BCVHMu2.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6EsJdZf.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3YUYSb9.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M3Hifok.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.6.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0W1FLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.6.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n# Target Corp. $103.00\n> **Target Corp.

{"title": "Complete Market Analysis", "selftext": "TL;DR: Scalp SPY calls early next week, VIX Calls and SPY Puts for the Month, Bulls are gay now\n\nThis is going to be a very thorough and extensive post riddled with some light humor so if you are too lazy and retarded to read just leave now. If you want my opinion and to be spoon fed some good data then sit down, shut up, and get ready to get a full load of knowledge to the face.\n\nMy vix play to 47 worked like a charm. I sold at the top and now am working on picking up calls around 50-70 as we consolidate for the next rocket ship up which will take us to 08' levels of 90 next month. Here is a chart i made with an explanation attached below regarding the vix play and the technical reasons behind it. So i am not going to double dip on my explanation here. [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/VIX/kx4Pygsl-Vix-to-90-in-March/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/VIX/kx4Pygsl-Vix-to-90-in-March/)\n\nI tend to try and avoid details on fundamentals so i am not going to talk about coronavirus other than acknowledge it is going to kill supply chains and consumerism for at the very least Q1. Repo market liquidity is drying up slowly and also expecting to be evaporate by April when the fed pulls out which will also pull another support peg this market may crutching on. Bernie's universal healthcare plan alone would wipe out about 16% of the S&P 500. Global economy as a whole has been teetering for awhile and just needed the final push off the ledge. I want to emphasize our corporate debt, overleveraged balance sheets, excessive derivative securities, all exacerbated by passive investing has helped build this problem. I point this out because this environment is perfect for overvaluations and bubbles to form and thrive. Its NOT coronavirus that is at fault for this upcoming recession, it is simply the spark that started the flame.\n\nI like looking at the vix and the market together as it helps me get a better picture for what is really occurring. This free fall dive is on pause for the moment in my opinion but definitely not over. I will belooking to scalp calls for a quick buck as the market rebounds for a breather early next week before we continue down. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/CYA8csw5/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/CYA8csw5/) I see 3200 as a likely candidate for a target as it is the bottom of the ichimoku cloud and also a serious support/resistance line as well as a round psychological number that the great jesse livermore loved so much. Once we kiss that level we can continue back down. 3125 is my next candidate for the top of this rebound because of tenken/kijun sen on daily as well as on the weekly. Ill be eyeing the RSI and Chaikin Oscillators to touch 30 and 0 respectively on daily as a possible resistance level on this bounce.\n\nId like to also address an interesting point regarding gamma and the dark pool Index (despite referencing it so often). This is a very interesting and unusual situation occurring. [https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix](https://squeezemetrics.com/monitor/dix). Notice how gamma is so low right? This allows for the massive chop in the market and favors downside. As it tightens we usually tend to move up. But i want to call into question the dark pool index which allows for market makers to improve profitability and take positions/sell positions without influencing the market (read the documentation page for a better understanding, im not gonna hold your hand and wipe your ass too, but i will fuck your mother.) So a quick look historically will show that before a market sells off like this the DPI tends to offload positions ahead of time. Then as it bottoms it tends to get bought up as they load up positions. This clearly isn't happening so far to the extent that should be expected, it looks like they were also caught off guard by the drop as it doesn't seem they were able to offload their positions ahead of time. More interesting, they aren't loading up too excessively yet either.\n\nJust a thought, I always thought bears are gay because they take it up the ass from so much loss on puts. With the drop last week and the future drops to come bulls are taking it up the ass on their calls. So realistically aren't the bulls gay now?\n\nGL Autists and godspeed", "id": "fbiff7", "created_utc": 1583007615.0, "score": 104, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "Read enough to know this guy is speaking Japanese because he has the corona.
