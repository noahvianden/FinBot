{"title": "Trade VXX Options and Predicting When VIX Will Spike", "selftext": "When it comes to trading VXX options, I mainly trade VXX options in the direction of price decay and do not buy VXX Call in anticipation of its price to go up.\n\nWhat is your experience trading VXX, UVXY, or any other volatility-related ETN? Do you have a process predicting the next Spike? I would love to hear your story.\n\nBelow is the process I take. For more details, [check out this post](https://alphapursuits.com/how-to-trade-vxx-options/).\n\n**1) Keep it simple (sell Naked Call options)**\n\nI like to sell out of the money (around 0.1 Delta) Naked Call options for two main reasons.\n\n* It gives me more time to react when VIX spikes compared to ATM or ITM Call options.\n* Avoid getting an early assignment.\n\n**2) Watch VIX9D**\n\nVIX9D estimates the expected 9-day volatility of S&P 500 stock returns. I watch this carefully because if it spikes up above VIX, in most cases something big is affecting the stock market.\n\nIf VIX9D is above VIX, it is one of the signals for me to consider closing out my VXX short Call positions.\n\n**3) Watch VVIX**\n\nVVIX is the volatility of VIX. Essentially volatility of volatility. When it's below 90, expect VIX to spike sometime relatively soon. VVIX has not gone down below 90 recently and at a calmer time, it frequents below 80, so the base number changes based on the market environment at the time.\n\nThis is just one of the many signals I watch so just because it is below 90, doesn't automatically mean that I close out all of my VXX short Call positions, but I would consider scaling back at opening new positions or decreasing my existing positions.\n\n**4) Watch VIX to VIX3M ratio**\n\nVIX 3M is a measure of 3-month implied volatility of the S&P 500. It gives a longer-term outlook of what the market is worrying about in the next few months. For example, most recently there was the US presidential election. As a result, the VIX-VIX3M ratio (Pink line) went above the average line (Green line) around October. Back in March was when COVID-19 hit the US. When a spike like that happens (red arrows), VIX will likely remain high for a while so it would be wise to get out or wait to open a VXX short Call position, until things start to calm down (green arrow).\n\nAnother factor to look for is how low the ratio is at the time. If it is close to the bottom (red boxes), most likely that trend will change at some point. This has happened recently during the summertime when COVID-19 case numbers started to go down worldwide. Even though VIX was still pretty high relative to last year's level, the VIX-VIX3M ratio reached close to the bottom. It spiked shortly after that.\n\nThe key is that VIX always reverts back to the mean. If it goes up, it comes back down. If it goes way down, it always goes up. We just need to find the right time to jump on and off the waves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VIX to VIX3M ratio](https://preview.redd.it/31bfuz453f161.png?width=1803&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e03ae0852f8290e86de15845ca7c7bb67ea0f8c)\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "k0trfg", "created_utc": 1606316750.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "I've been selling VXX calls for two months now.

I know these industries are not similar at all, but it's to help put things into perspective mathematically. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla has a revenue of 20 billion. Tesla has a market cap of 544 billion. This is an extremely overvalued stock for a multitude of reasons, but just looking at it mathematically and their revenue projections for a year on don't add up to their market cap. Basically, Tesla's market cap exceeds Tesla's revenue 27 times over. \n\nPalantir has a revenue of 800 million, but let's just say 1 billion. In their earning report, they said they can release their revenue 50%! I believe them 100%. A revenue increase from 1 billion of 50% is 500 million right? Maybe there is something fundamental that I'm not understanding, but I just don't see how Palantir can get from 1 billion revenue to their 50 billion market cap. I understand that stocks are basically a way of betting on future potential growth, but I don't see how Palantir can grow 500% in the next 5 years even. Growing to that size in a decade is more realistic to reach that market cap. \n\nJust know that when you buy PTLR right now, you are betting on basic momentum continuing forward or the continued hype around it.

{"title": "PLTR to $500/share - The Origin Story, Paypal Mafia", "selftext": "For those of you who enjoyed my post on why the WSB is moving markets, see below. \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why\\_wsb\\_is\\_now\\_running\\_the\\_entire\\_equity\\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/)\n\nNow Let me tell you a story about Palantir and why it is so important. \n\nSee, back in 1998, there were two internet payments company who were trying to make it big, one run by Peter Thiel and one run by Elon Musk. They eventually merged and created paypal. You can see the two of them here in the same picture. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ie03xvwgg161.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9368996a40228d96dae30a8d14c9a7b22d446a8\n\nSo why is paypal important. Well the Paypal mafia is known for building basically the entire post dot-com tech landscape that you know today. Yelp, youtube, square, linkedin, tesla/space X. And who is Peter Thiel, well, he is basically the smartest venture capitalist in the world and very well known in Silicon Valley. He was the first outside investor in facebook, he backed Tesla and SpaceX. \n\nSo why does this matter? Well, Peter Thiel is one of the smartest men in the world. He was Chess grandmaster in his youth and he has a brilliant, contrarian mind. He foresaw the rise of SJW in the late 90s, this man either can predict the future or he is a time traveler. Either way, he is a savant. \n\nNow on to Palantir \n\nSo why does this matter for Palantir. Peter founded Palantir in 2003. That was 17 years ago. What was his plan? Well, I think his plan is to create the next IBM. So hear me out. Well, historically the development of internet technology swung between enterprise and consumer. Prior to 2000, nobody in Silicon valley knew anything about consumer internet, everyone was busy chasing HP contracts or trying grab a DOD tender. But it swung to consumer for the next 20 years. He is making a calculating bet that consumer is played out and the next swing will be in the form of enteprise/government sales. \n\nAnd who was the big boss of enterprise/gov sales. Well it was IBM. See IBM wasn\u2019t just the giant in computing that dominated from 1940-1980s, it started off selling office tools like punch cards and typewritters. They didn't have the best technology, but they had a big rolodex of government and corporate clients. When the computing revolution came around in the 1950s, it wasn't the best technology that won, but the one with the customer distribution. \n\nThe same thing is happening with Palantir, they are doing manpower intensive work for governments and large corporates now, its not really a high margin scalable business (which is why wallstreet poo-hoos the stocks). But the thing is, they are positioned perfectly for the rise of AI. Much as the same way IBM was well positioned for the rise of computing. \n\nAnd that is why, PLTR will hit $500/share by 2030", "id": "k11uq6", "created_utc": 1606341330.0, "score": 177, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "TLDR but I\u2019ll upvote whatever confirms my bias", "score": 98, "replies": [{"body": "Peter Thiel is your lord and savior", "score": 26, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16269023716449738}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09550201147794724}, {"body": "Pays \n\nLong\n\nTerm\n\nReturns", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "Penis\n\nLength\n\nTotally\n\nRetarded", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Pussy \nLIips\nToo\nRestricted", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Please Listen To Redditors", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1630498319864273}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2495630532503128}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16606605052947998}, {"body": "Probably \nListened \nTo \nRetards", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04742378741502762}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24379286170005798}, {"body": "Before or after 5 to 1 stock split?", "score": 27, "replies": [{"body": "After.
