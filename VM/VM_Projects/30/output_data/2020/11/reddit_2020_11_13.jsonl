{"title": "Pandemic or Not, Visa Remains a Growth Stock Stalking Its Biggest Rival, Cash", "selftext": "Visa stock has made investors more than 1,000% over the past decade -- peppy for an organization that dates back to the Eisenhower administration. But here comes a gaggle of app-based hopefuls eyeing not just the toll roads that make credit cards work, but also the $2 trillion in worldwide revenues collected for payments of all kinds.\n\nYou know about PayPal (ticker: PYPL) and maybe Square (SQ) and Venmo. How about Remitly, Stripe, Circle, and Bolt? There are dozens more with Seussian names. To skip out on a dinner check with under-30s, just mock the encryption protocol of their favorite fintech platform, and tell them you'll froop them ticklecoins.\n\nI spoke this past week with Visa (V) chief Al Kelly about the competitive landscape in payments. That's a sensitive subject now, because Visa is trying to buy a company called Plaid, which serves as a data go-between for banks and apps. For example, Venmo uses Plaid. This month, the Department of Justice sued to block the deal, alleging that it would deprive consumers of a potential alternative to Visa. Kelly calls the deal pro-consumer and says Visa will fight the suit vigorously. \"We feel very, very good about that,\" he says.\n\nVisa was spawned from the first true credit card -- the paper, $300-limit BankAmericard, launched in 1958. Bank of America kept the credit business but licensed the financial plumbing for cards to other banks. This eventually became Visa, and a rival system launched in 1966 became Mastercard (MC). Today, Visa links 70 million sellers with 3.5 billion account credentials issued by 13,000 banks. It collects fees per transaction for authorization, clearing, and settlement, and it sells add-on services for things like detecting fraud and increasing customer loyalty.\n\nThis year, I've come to view paying in cash and receiving change as the financial equivalent of shaking hands during a bilateral sneeze. Giving over a credit card for swiping, or sliding my own and pawing a number pad, is more like an elbow bump -- better, but do we really have to? Tap-to-pay is the norm in most of the world, but not the U.S. -- yet. Kelly says it will be common here soon. If past patterns from other markets repeat, tap-to-pay will bring a big jump in the percentage of U.S. transactions done with cards.\n\nCard adoption is already climbing -- to 82.1% of in-store transactions from 78.7% in January, according to industry researcher The NPD Group. But opportunities for spending have shriveled. So, during Visa's fiscal year ended in September, revenues decreased 5%, to $21.8 billion, and earnings per share fell 7%, to $5.04. Visa is larger than Mastercard and is particularly dominant in debit cards, but Mastercard has been growing faster, especially in Europe. Both have been smaller for years than China's UnionPay.\n\nAnalysts call these networks card rails, and the bank-controlled Automated Clearing House, or ACH, system for money transfers, bank rails. Many upstart players operate as digital wallets that depend in part on card or bank rails, or else use cryptocurrency. Kelly says the payments industry is filled with \"frenemies.\" For example, PayPal, the best-known digital wallet for online purchases, used to steer customers to cheaper ACH rather than Visa cards. Now, under a partnership, Visa gets equal footing with ACH, and PayPal makes inroads at stores using Visa's contactless mobile-payment technology.\n\nStocks in general trade at elevated valuations now, and growth stocks especially. Even so, Visa's price of 38 times this fiscal year's estimated earnings suggests that investors feel confident about its future role in payments, and its return to speedy growth. This fiscal year, earnings-per-share growth is pegged at just 9%, as the pandemic continues and then hopefully lifts. Early estimates for next year's growth put it at 24%. Beyond the tap-to-pay rollout and spending rebound, Visa is hoping to win over push transactions that use bank rails -- like tuition, rent, and wages. Banks will have a say, but they make good money on card businesses, and ACH is a nonprofit.\n\nChina is a wild card. Visa doesn't have a license to operate there domestically, so it partners with local players like AliPay to create new uses for travelers' Visa cards. But phase one of the trade deal between China and the Trump administration is supposed to open China to foreign payment companies like Visa. We'll see. For now, Kelly calls cash his biggest competitor. I'm Purelling just thinking about all that market share up for grabs.\n\nThe stock market is said to be driven by the battle between greed and fear. Right now, it looks more like hope and stupidity. The vaccine results announced this past week by Pfizer (PFE) are the best hope yet that the pandemic's end is in sight. That vaccine and perhaps others could receive emergency-use authorization within the next two months, and much of America could receive needle pokes in the first half of next year. Life could look normal by Thanksgiving 2021.\n\nBut the virus is raging like never before. We've turned simple advice -- keep a bit of distance or wear masks -- into a culture war. And Washington is distracted. That President Donald Trump is denying clear election results is folly. That an overwhelming majority of his party's senators won't speak up is dangerous. If it doesn't damage our democracy, it could kill us by the tens of thousands this winter from inaction on the virus. And it could cripple our economy again.\n\n\"Sell the vaccine,\" wrote Bank of America in an investment strategy note on Friday. It means to reduce holdings of risky assets ahead of what could be a difficult stretch before the economy reopens in earnest. Like Goldman Sachs, BofA is recommending a barbell strategy, with cyclicals on one side, but not distressed ones, and the sort of virus-immune tech stocks that have been flourishing all along on the other.\n\nI know; I dipped too far into politics there for a moment. Media bias, a few will say, and they're right. I don't endorse politicians or parties, but secretly, I'm in the tank for science and representative democracy.\n\n**Source: Barron's Article**", "id": "jtrewh", "created_utc": 1605311098.0, "score": 90, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 39, "comments": [{"body": "Visa seems super popular around here, but Mastercard seems to have higher growth in the last decade.
