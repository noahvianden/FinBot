{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, Nov 12, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 12, 2020**\n\nStocks fell today, with the Dow Jones and S&P 500 adding to yesterday\u2019s losses with market participants closely monitoring the political situation in the US and a worsening virus situation despite positive vaccine data.\n\nThe Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.46% down, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.93%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the worst, finishing 1.03% down.\n\nSince Joe Biden\u2019s victory on Saturday, President Trump has struck an increasingly defiant tone, refusing to concede the election and baselessly claiming widespread, national voter fraud in favor of the Democrats. Since then Trump filed a flurry of lawsuits against key states, alleging voter fraud. Most of these suits have been thrown out of Court for insufficient evidence. Moreover, Trump is purposefully blocking Biden from accessing key information needed for a smooth transition of power. \n\nToday, Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration was pulling back from negotiating a new stimulus package. There will likely be no further stimulus until a change in administration is made on January 20th. \n\nSadly, this week alone, daily new coronavirus cases in the United States went from a little over 100,000 (a record at the time) to more than 145,000 cases as of Wednesday, a new record of daily cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The US has set a new number of daily infections every day this week, a very worrying sign. Hospitalizations are also on the rise, with the country recording record amounts of patients hospitalized with COVID the past two days, climbing from 61,964 on Tuesday to 65,368 on Wednesday, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. That\u2019s double the number of hospitalizations compared to a month ago. North Dakota and Wisconsin have warned their hospitals are reaching capacity, with both State\u2019s governors declaring a state of emergency. Texas became the first state to surpass 1 million cases of coronavirus. The rise in infections comes with new highs in the number of deaths reported in a single day at 1,549, the highest since May 14. Tennessee, Alabama and Minnesota all reached new highs in the number of deaths reported in a single day, according to data compiled by the Washington Post.\n\nEarlier in the week, hopes of market participants and the public overall were greatly raised by Pfizer\u2019s (PFE) announcement that their clinical trial showed their vaccine candidate had a 90% effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 in participants with no evidence of a previous infection. However, optimism moderated after it became clear that even with approval, widespread distribution of the vaccine wouldn\u2019t take place until 2021.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Weekly jobless claims fall again in a sign of labor market improvement: a Total 709,000 actual claims vs 740,000 estimate\n* India announces $35B economic stimulus package to aid in recovering from the pandemic.\n* EV (Electric Vehicle) stocks were on absolute FIRE on the back of a nice earnings call by Xpeng Auto $XPEV!!!

These stocks haven't really popped off yet but some of them show some real potential. KNDI, for example, is offering the cheapest, fully electric, fully-fledged cars in North America right now. Their K27 model is only $10k after the federal tax credit you get for buying an EV. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSOLO, on the other hand, is producing smaller, 3-wheeled vehicles that don't qualify as cars and also don't qualify for the federal tax credit, but they're still small and could prove effective in certain demographics in the US. They're also producing fleets for first responders and mail carriers which could really help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKNDI 7c 6/18/21\n\nSOLO 5c 6/18/21", "id": "jt2p9p", "created_utc": 1605213505.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "I'm bullish in the short term for FSR.
