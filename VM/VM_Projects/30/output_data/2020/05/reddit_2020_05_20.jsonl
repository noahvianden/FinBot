{"title": "Day 7 5/16 : From Down to Up - The Road to $18385.37 -19.40% ($2364.82 - $1904.13)", "selftext": "Well it's official, working my day job provides better returns than me day trading. I will admit that I was kind of hoping to put that to rest and be able to double my income, but the unfortunate reality is that I cannot.\n\nToday was by far the worst day of me day trading so far, and a myriad of issues came up that really prevented me from not only getting out of bad decisions, but making bad ones worse. At this point I have completely lost all of the gains that I made in my first 3 days, which while is disappointing, there's also strangely freeing? I definitely feel bad about it but I feel less bad about this than I did yesterday when I lost \\~$100.\n\nToday I got off to a bad start, not going in on my trading plan with DDOG and TWLO at the entry point that I wanted, completely ignored DDOG to my misfortune and focused on TWLO, which is where I made my biggest error day trading so far. I was trying to set up a limit order that would go into effect if TWLO went up to a certain price point. Unfortunately I set it up incorrectly, and ended up purchasing a contract well above its current mark price. I ended up taking a $100 loss on that one, because TWLO proceeded to go in the opposite direction. I then tried a little later on TWLO, but ended up losing that as well. And that was really the day, everything else was that mistake compounded again and again and again.\n\nTomorrow I am going to do my best to execute my morning trading plan - which is to look at DDOG, TWLO, AMZN, FB, and MAYBE Netflix, all of which I think have upside potential within the first 30 minutes or so. We shall see which I end up entering\n\nI think coming out of today I have learned two lessons.\n\n1. I need to stick to my strategy, it actively inhibits my worst instincts, and keeps me out of trouble. Today I was really tired of watching my stops hit and then seeing something go up afterwards, so I tried to let things run instead of stopping out. This ended up costing me big time in several plays.\n2. My recent losses have made me gun-shy to hop onto things that I think are going to go well, and it's actively making me avoid hopping on trends when I see them. The reason this is an issue is because I keep watching the stock, wait for it to come to a plateau, buy in then - and watch my profits get eaten away as the IV goes down and it reverses direction I'm basically putting myself in the worst position of catching the falling knife - literally catching it after its gone through my hands and into my toe.\n3. I need to get more sleep and wake up earlier. I spent this morning making mistakes that cost me because I was tired and not able to focus. I need to get to sleep sooner and wake up better in the morning. \n\nDay 7: 5/19 -19.40% ($2364.82 - $1904.13)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mf32an52htz41.png?width=1258&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a2927492a316018818b97fa94faf4039c80f5fa\n\nDay 6: 5/18 -4.98% ($2489.82 - $2364.82)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BA 5/22 140c|\\+ $7|2|$183|$188|\n|DDOG 6/19 75c|$0|2|$285|$285|\n|DIS 5/22 122c|\\-$14|1|$66|$52|\n|JD 5/22 55c|\\-$3|1|$129|$126|\n|LRCX 5/22 280c|\\+$12|2|$100|$106|\n|LUV 5/29 27c|\\+$2|1|$98|$100|\n|NVDA 5/22 400c|\\-$26|1|$266|$240|\n|PDD 5/22 75c|\\+$15|1|$140|$155|\n|VTIQ 6/19 25c|\\-$44|1|$309|$265|\n|W 5/22 125p|\\-$27|1|$135|$108|\n|ZS 5/22 77.5c|\\-$30|1|$165|$135|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 5: 5/15 -6.57% ($2665.08 - $2489.82)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BYND 5/22 120P|\\-$18|1|$186|$168|\n|JD 5/22 50C|\\-$14|1|$134|$120|\n|JD 5/22 51C|\\+$1|1|$120|$121|\n|NEM 5/22 68.5C|\\-$23|1|$179|$159|\n|TWLO 5/22 205C|\\-$49|1|$400|$351|\n|TWTR 5/22 30C|\\+$30|3|$73|$78|\n|UBER 5/22 33C|\\-$12|2|$109|$103|\n|VTIQ 6/19 30C|\\-$4|1|$285|$281|\n|WIX 6/19 240C|\\-$55|1|$419|$364|\n|WORK 5/22 32C|\\-$13|1|$129|$116|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 4: 5/14 +9.96% ($1968.86 - $2165.08)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|TWLO 5/22 200c|\\-$26|1|$425|$399|\n|BAC 5/15 21C|\\+$63|3|$41|$62|\n|GS 5/15 172.5C|\\+$46|2|$183|$206|\n|JPM 5/15 87C|\\+$135|5|$68|$95|\n|LCRX 5/15 270C|\\-$77|1|$342|$265|\n|MS 5/15 37.5C|\\+$10|5|$44|$46|\n|WFC 5/15 24C|\\+$67|3|$41|$63.5|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 3: 5/13 +8.35% - $1356.57 - $1469.84\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CODX 6/19 20C|\\-$22|1|$277|$255|\n|TWLO 5/22 200C|\\+$174|1|$469|$643|\n|DDOG 5/15 70C|\\+$45|1|$200|$245|\n|NVDA 5/15 335C|\\-$39|1|$213|$174|\n|ZM 5/15 180C|\\-$39|1|$180|$141|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 2: 5/12 +29.53% - $1046.34 - $1356.57\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CRM 6/19 200C|\\+2|1|$263|$265|\n|EGHT 6/19 20C|\\+59|1|$191|$250|\n|TWLO 5/29 205C|\\+30|1|$370|$400|\n|VTIQ 5/15 30C|\\+224|2|$103|$215|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 1: 5/11 +5% - $1000.89 - $1046.34\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|DDOG 5/15 55c|\\+54|1|$380|$434|\n|CSCO 5/15 44.5c|\\-16|2|$214|$198|\n|CHWY 5/15 39.5c|\\+12|1|$134|$146|", "id": "gn1bo2", "created_utc": 1589935867.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is a casino", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "that be taking me to the cleaners on a daily basis.", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12369219213724136}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.148185595870018}, {"body": "youre playing way too many positions (while still working fulltime?)\n\nif you cut that to 1-2  you have less stress managing your postitions, life and real work and you should pick better plays. what is your boyfriend thinking when you check your positions every 2 minutes? thats not sustainable", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I'll admit my job has taken a bit of a backseat.

{"title": "LK resumes trading tomorrow at 7:00 AM (Bullish and Bearish case)", "selftext": "NASDAQ announced Luckin Coffee will resume trading tomorrow morning from 7:00 am ET\nThey have also announced they plan on delisting the stock, Luckin has appealed this and there will be a hearing. These hearings usually take 30 to 45 days from the date of the appeal.\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/luckin-coffee-to-resume-trading-wednesday-as-company-receives-delisting-notice-2020-05-19\n\nDURING THE HALT:\nSince the stock was halted because of the accounting scandal, they have fired their CEO and COO. \nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-luckin-coffee-investigation-idUSKBN22O29J\n\nThe company is also under investigation by Chinese regulators\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/luckin-coffee-under-investigation-by-chinas-top-commerce-regulator-11587967299\n\nHowever they have continued to open new stores at the rates of 10 per day, and had a total of 6912 stores as of May 12th\nhttps://www.bloombergquint.com/china/luckin-coffee-still-expanding-full-steam-despite-sales-scandal\n\nThe company has increased its registered capital by $500m to bring it to $2B\nhttps://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/scandal-stricken-luckin-coffee-adds-usd500-million-to-registered-capital\n\nGOLDMAN SACHS:\nGoldman Sachs is bagholding over $350m of the stock because Luckin chairman defaulted on the terms of his margin loan. It was a $518m loan, so Goldman is down $169m based on the current LK stock price. Goldman have said they intend to sell the stock.\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/d0c81e1b-88db-4609-aaa6-ec3a18af374f\n\n\nThe stock closed at $4.39 before it was halted. That gives it a $1.11B valuation.\n\nBEARISH CASE:\nLongs are going to try and get out of their positions tomorrow morning after being forced to hold for so long, the delisting news makes the situation much much worse.\nWith all this pressure, the stock might drop to as low as $1 or atleast $2\n\nBULLISH CASE:\nYou really wanna be bullish on this? Alright autust, have it your way. \nThe company has continued to expand during the halt and may have been oversold after the scandal. The stock has been halted since April 7th, thats a lot of interest that shorts have had to pay up and after having held for so long they will wanna cover their positions too. Since Goldman Sachs owns such a huge stake they might do some Goldman things to prop it up.\n\nTLDR:\n(It might be too late by the time options markets open, you will have to buy/short the stock. Sorry autists, no strike, expiry here but the risk is still there.)\nShort it if you are autistic but sane, go long if you are the kind of retard that buys bankruptcy stocks for a bounce. If you aren't either get your ass back to r/investing.\n\nMy positions:\nI am currently badholding 207 shares of the stock thanks to 2 puts I sold just before the halt, the other 7 shares I bought because I was bored.", "id": "gn3pr5", "created_utc": 1589944923.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "Buying 10k worth of shares in the morning let's gooooo", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "rip this guy", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20915935933589935}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3730543851852417}, {"body": "I\u2019m diving into LK like Your dad\u2019s jizz into your mommies panties.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Good luck trying to get into the position then \ud83d\ude02", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22811277210712433}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1350872665643692}, {"body": "Gayman sackless bagholding?

It also claimed to have exited 2019 with about $500 million in cash and to have cut down selling, general and administrative expenses by $130.4 million.\n\nCons:\n\nA) You can buy video games at so many places now - Target, Walmart, Best Buy, digital downloads from the publisher, etc. \n\nEDIT:This includes publisher platforms like Steam, GOG, XBox store, PSN, Nintendo store, Epic games, even Green man gaming.\n\nB)   Hestia Capital Partners LP and Permit Capital are activist investors and fighting to put their own board picks for the annual meeting schedule on 6/12/20.  GME has responded by sending out letters to their shareholders urging them to vote for their own picks.  Regardless uncertainty continues to be a pressure point for them going ahead.\n\nReminds me of the HOG (many autist bears like myself got smoked on that trade) activist shareholder battle which was ultimately resolved ahead of earnings.  I don't see GME resolving anything before earnings but it could do so before the June 12 meeting.\n\n[http://www.RestoreGameStop.com/presentation](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2809120-1&h=1273700596&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.restoregamestop.com%2Fpresentation&a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.RestoreGameStop.com%2Fpresentation)\n\nC) All of their stores were closed\\*( see above) for March and April.  Some may have reopened in states that lift ed restrictions but foot traffic is probably low.\n\nD) Accounting officer resigned recently (claimed it was for personal reasons) but people are skeptical.\n\nE) IV is ridiculously high for options. even same week like this week options.  Maybe better to play this buying the stock outright and riding it much like bargain shoppers on r/Investing are buying Macy's stock.\n\nBUT the IV for LEAPS is more reasonable ( by GME standards) and there is actually some decent volume on them. See the Jan 21/5c's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME IV closing bell snapshot.](https://preview.redd.it/4r9s1wfc7zz41.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c081cdc7a208ed00da2dc819064afb4d99945f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Buy GME LEAP calls. The proxy fight and other uncertainties should be resolved by the next meeting but don't count on it.

{"title": "Day 7 5/16 : From Down to Up - The Road to $18385.37 -19.40% ($2364.82 - $1904.13)", "selftext": "Well it's official, working my day job provides better returns than me day trading. I will admit that I was kind of hoping to put that to rest and be able to double my income, but the unfortunate reality is that I cannot.\n\nToday was by far the worst day of me day trading so far, and a myriad of issues came up that really prevented me from not only getting out of bad decisions, but making bad ones worse. At this point I have completely lost all of the gains that I made in my first 3 days, which while is disappointing, there's also strangely freeing? I definitely feel bad about it but I feel less bad about this than I did yesterday when I lost \\~$100.\n\nToday I got off to a bad start, not going in on my trading plan with DDOG and TWLO at the entry point that I wanted, completely ignored DDOG to my misfortune and focused on TWLO, which is where I made my biggest error day trading so far. I was trying to set up a limit order that would go into effect if TWLO went up to a certain price point. Unfortunately I set it up incorrectly, and ended up purchasing a contract well above its current mark price. I ended up taking a $100 loss on that one, because TWLO proceeded to go in the opposite direction. I then tried a little later on TWLO, but ended up losing that as well. And that was really the day, everything else was that mistake compounded again and again and again.\n\nTomorrow I am going to do my best to execute my morning trading plan - which is to look at DDOG, TWLO, AMZN, FB, and MAYBE Netflix, all of which I think have upside potential within the first 30 minutes or so. We shall see which I end up entering\n\nI think coming out of today I have learned two lessons.\n\n1. I need to stick to my strategy, it actively inhibits my worst instincts, and keeps me out of trouble. Today I was really tired of watching my stops hit and then seeing something go up afterwards, so I tried to let things run instead of stopping out. This ended up costing me big time in several plays.\n2. My recent losses have made me gun-shy to hop onto things that I think are going to go well, and it's actively making me avoid hopping on trends when I see them. The reason this is an issue is because I keep watching the stock, wait for it to come to a plateau, buy in then - and watch my profits get eaten away as the IV goes down and it reverses direction I'm basically putting myself in the worst position of catching the falling knife - literally catching it after its gone through my hands and into my toe.\n3. I need to get more sleep and wake up earlier. I spent this morning making mistakes that cost me because I was tired and not able to focus. I need to get to sleep sooner and wake up better in the morning. \n\nDay 7: 5/19 -19.40% ($2364.82 - $1904.13)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mf32an52htz41.png?width=1258&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a2927492a316018818b97fa94faf4039c80f5fa\n\nDay 6: 5/18 -4.98% ($2489.82 - $2364.82)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BA 5/22 140c|\\+ $7|2|$183|$188|\n|DDOG 6/19 75c|$0|2|$285|$285|\n|DIS 5/22 122c|\\-$14|1|$66|$52|\n|JD 5/22 55c|\\-$3|1|$129|$126|\n|LRCX 5/22 280c|\\+$12|2|$100|$106|\n|LUV 5/29 27c|\\+$2|1|$98|$100|\n|NVDA 5/22 400c|\\-$26|1|$266|$240|\n|PDD 5/22 75c|\\+$15|1|$140|$155|\n|VTIQ 6/19 25c|\\-$44|1|$309|$265|\n|W 5/22 125p|\\-$27|1|$135|$108|\n|ZS 5/22 77.5c|\\-$30|1|$165|$135|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 5: 5/15 -6.57% ($2665.08 - $2489.82)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|BYND 5/22 120P|\\-$18|1|$186|$168|\n|JD 5/22 50C|\\-$14|1|$134|$120|\n|JD 5/22 51C|\\+$1|1|$120|$121|\n|NEM 5/22 68.5C|\\-$23|1|$179|$159|\n|TWLO 5/22 205C|\\-$49|1|$400|$351|\n|TWTR 5/22 30C|\\+$30|3|$73|$78|\n|UBER 5/22 33C|\\-$12|2|$109|$103|\n|VTIQ 6/19 30C|\\-$4|1|$285|$281|\n|WIX 6/19 240C|\\-$55|1|$419|$364|\n|WORK 5/22 32C|\\-$13|1|$129|$116|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 4: 5/14 +9.96% ($1968.86 - $2165.08)\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|TWLO 5/22 200c|\\-$26|1|$425|$399|\n|BAC 5/15 21C|\\+$63|3|$41|$62|\n|GS 5/15 172.5C|\\+$46|2|$183|$206|\n|JPM 5/15 87C|\\+$135|5|$68|$95|\n|LCRX 5/15 270C|\\-$77|1|$342|$265|\n|MS 5/15 37.5C|\\+$10|5|$44|$46|\n|WFC 5/15 24C|\\+$67|3|$41|$63.5|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 3: 5/13 +8.35% - $1356.57 - $1469.84\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CODX 6/19 20C|\\-$22|1|$277|$255|\n|TWLO 5/22 200C|\\+$174|1|$469|$643|\n|DDOG 5/15 70C|\\+$45|1|$200|$245|\n|NVDA 5/15 335C|\\-$39|1|$213|$174|\n|ZM 5/15 180C|\\-$39|1|$180|$141|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 2: 5/12 +29.53% - $1046.34 - $1356.57\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|CRM 6/19 200C|\\+2|1|$263|$265|\n|EGHT 6/19 20C|\\+59|1|$191|$250|\n|TWLO 5/29 205C|\\+30|1|$370|$400|\n|VTIQ 5/15 30C|\\+224|2|$103|$215|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDay 1: 5/11 +5% - $1000.89 - $1046.34\n\n|Position|Day P/L|Quantity|Bought|Sold|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|DDOG 5/15 55c|\\+54|1|$380|$434|\n|CSCO 5/15 44.5c|\\-16|2|$214|$198|\n|CHWY 5/15 39.5c|\\+12|1|$134|$146|", "id": "gn1bo2", "created_utc": 1589935867.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "Sir, this is a casino", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "that be taking me to the cleaners on a daily basis.", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12369216978549957}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1481858491897583}, {"body": "youre playing way too many positions (while still working fulltime?)\n\nif you cut that to 1-2  you have less stress managing your postitions, life and real work and you should pick better plays. what is your boyfriend thinking when you check your positions every 2 minutes? thats not sustainable", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "I'll admit my job has taken a bit of a backseat.

These hearings usually take 30 to 45 days from the date of the appeal.\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/luckin-coffee-to-resume-trading-wednesday-as-company-receives-delisting-notice-2020-05-19\n\nDURING THE HALT:\nSince the stock was halted because of the accounting scandal, they have fired their CEO and COO. \nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-luckin-coffee-investigation-idUSKBN22O29J\n\nThe company is also under investigation by Chinese regulators\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/luckin-coffee-under-investigation-by-chinas-top-commerce-regulator-11587967299\n\nHowever they have continued to open new stores at the rates of 10 per day, and had a total of 6912 stores as of May 12th\nhttps://www.bloombergquint.com/china/luckin-coffee-still-expanding-full-steam-despite-sales-scandal\n\nThe company has increased its registered capital by $500m to bring it to $2B\nhttps://www.yicaiglobal.com/news/scandal-stricken-luckin-coffee-adds-usd500-million-to-registered-capital\n\nGOLDMAN SACHS:\nGoldman Sachs is bagholding over $350m of the stock because Luckin chairman defaulted on the terms of his margin loan. It was a $518m loan, so Goldman is down $169m based on the current LK stock price. Goldman have said they intend to sell the stock.\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/d0c81e1b-88db-4609-aaa6-ec3a18af374f\n\n\nThe stock closed at $4.39 before it was halted. That gives it a $1.11B valuation.\n\nBEARISH CASE:\nLongs are going to try and get out of their positions tomorrow morning after being forced to hold for so long, the delisting news makes the situation much much worse.\nWith all this pressure, the stock might drop to as low as $1 or atleast $2\n\nBULLISH CASE:\nYou really wanna be bullish on this? Alright autust, have it your way. \nThe company has continued to expand during the halt and may have been oversold after the scandal. The stock has been halted since April 7th, thats a lot of interest that shorts have had to pay up and after having held for so long they will wanna cover their positions too. Since Goldman Sachs owns such a huge stake they might do some Goldman things to prop it up.\n\nTLDR:\n(It might be too late by the time options markets open, you will have to buy/short the stock. Sorry autists, no strike, expiry here but the risk is still there.)\nShort it if you are autistic but sane, go long if you are the kind of retard that buys bankruptcy stocks for a bounce. If you aren't either get your ass back to r/investing.\n\nMy positions:\nI am currently badholding 207 shares of the stock thanks to 2 puts I sold just before the halt, the other 7 shares I bought because I was bored.", "id": "gn3pr5", "created_utc": 1589944923.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 32, "comments": [{"body": "Buying 10k worth of shares in the morning let's gooooo", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "rip this guy", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20915931463241577}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3730543553829193}, {"body": "I\u2019m diving into LK like Your dad\u2019s jizz into your mommies panties.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Good luck trying to get into the position then \ud83d\ude02", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22811292111873627}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13508734107017517}, {"body": "Gayman sackless bagholding?

It also claimed to have exited 2019 with about $500 million in cash and to have cut down selling, general and administrative expenses by $130.4 million.\n\nCons:\n\nA) You can buy video games at so many places now - Target, Walmart, Best Buy, digital downloads from the publisher, etc. \n\nEDIT:This includes publisher platforms like Steam, GOG, XBox store, PSN, Nintendo store, Epic games, even Green man gaming.\n\nB)   Hestia Capital Partners LP and Permit Capital are activist investors and fighting to put their own board picks for the annual meeting schedule on 6/12/20.  GME has responded by sending out letters to their shareholders urging them to vote for their own picks.  Regardless uncertainty continues to be a pressure point for them going ahead.\n\nReminds me of the HOG (many autist bears like myself got smoked on that trade) activist shareholder battle which was ultimately resolved ahead of earnings.  I don't see GME resolving anything before earnings but it could do so before the June 12 meeting.\n\n[http://www.RestoreGameStop.com/presentation](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&l=en&o=2809120-1&h=1273700596&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.restoregamestop.com%2Fpresentation&a=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.RestoreGameStop.com%2Fpresentation)\n\nC) All of their stores were closed\\*( see above) for March and April.  Some may have reopened in states that lift ed restrictions but foot traffic is probably low.\n\nD) Accounting officer resigned recently (claimed it was for personal reasons) but people are skeptical.\n\nE) IV is ridiculously high for options. even same week like this week options.  Maybe better to play this buying the stock outright and riding it much like bargain shoppers on r/Investing are buying Macy's stock.\n\nBUT the IV for LEAPS is more reasonable ( by GME standards) and there is actually some decent volume on them. See the Jan 21/5c's.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME IV closing bell snapshot.](https://preview.redd.it/4r9s1wfc7zz41.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7c081cdc7a208ed00da2dc819064afb4d99945f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: Buy GME LEAP calls. The proxy fight and other uncertainties should be resolved by the next meeting but don't count on it.
