I bought 40 shares at $6.50, and that was me getting in what I considered to be late (opened my trading account when it was at $4.93 and by the time my funds hit the stock was already well into the high $5s). It looks like a good move so far, but anything can happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway,  I've been holding... holding... waiting to get my big chunk into the market (not much, \\~$2K). Haven't made big buys yet, but yesterday and today I've put in limit buys for 5 stocks I've been staring at for 2 weeks, and now I've missed a couple different +10% days. Now where I've put my limits is much higher than it would've been last week. It doesn't feel right because I've been holding off waiting for another drop, but it doesn't seem like it's coming now. The Memorial Day rally has caused me to rethink this and now I feel like I may need to get back in before it's WAY too late. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI opened my Fidelity account right smack dab in the middle of the bottom out, but the funds weren't available until days later when the market had already corrected itself. Unfortunately for me, I decided to hold, take notes, and watch the markets every day since, hoping for another dip. The problem is the opposite happened with the Memorial Day rally and now I'm afraid that dip might not happen, and if it does and I buy in now, I'll take unnecessary losses that may have been avoided with some patience and trust in my fundamental knowledge.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI guess my question is this. Do I buy in now? Do I continue to be patient for what could be an inevitable 2nd crash or down spike? Or do you think we are in the clear and I should just buy now and try to forget about what could have been? It just really feels like this rally bubble could burst, even if it happens gradually. At the same time, it may not.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now I've got limit buy orders in intentionally too low to hit today, probably. But this is what got me here in the first place. Could really use at least some conversation about it. No one here is going to convince me either way, but it is nice to read others having the same concerns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor the record, I am a purely fundamental trader.

There is the school of thought that it doesn't matter because we own the currency that all of our debt is in. Essentially, this argument goes, you can't owe money to yourself. Other more doomsday arguments, say that the whole thing must collapse any day now. The truth is, we don't know. It's not like we have another planet in the future where we can compare ourselves to their world currency inventor and see what ultimately happens to them. The future is not written yet. We may get to a point technologically where everyone owes gazillions to everybody and we all just throw our hands up and say F#%k it, cancel it all and start over. Or only we do that, basically saying, we're never going to pay everyone back their money. Then various bond and treasury holders around the world could try to stage a revolt, but as long as we have the nuclear missiles, that argument is moot.\n\nThe interesting question is, will we allow a private corporation like spacex to gain enough power and control over the planet, that the private capital groups who want their money actually go through a private corporation to execute their revolt?\n\nI believe the US move to create a \"space force\" which can enforce the superiority of our currency beyond the atmosphere, is happening precisely so that we can control the chessboard when the time comes. Tesla, for example, could threaten to turn starlink off to select areas,  unless a foreign VIP gets their their capital out.\n\nSuper unlikely, but thats how I envision a run on the US treasury looking.\n\nI say super unlikely, because it appears that the companies that intend on controlling the energy and communication infrastructure in the future, are all based in the USA and run by people that believe in the continued dominance of the US dollar.

{"title": "Overall Market - 10,000 ft view", "selftext": "Bears, Bulls, Fags, and Autists, \n\nI'm honestly sick of the memes. Blahblahblah money printer go brrrr... technical analysis of blahblahblah recession is coming. Enough. I need you all to suddenly be smarter. So please read the following. Take an adderall or something, this is important. \n\nIf you are buying options on indexes, or derivatives of indexes, just fucking knock that shit off. It's not a wise investment, even if we are pretending any options play is 'wise'. In fact, it's much, much better to be trading options on individual stocks. \n\nFurther, it is better to be looking at stocks that actually have\\*not\\* gained 100% since March 3. No, it isn't smart to buy puts on these stocks ($W, $CHGG, $OKTA, $LOGI, etc.)\n\nWe are in a **market recovery phase**, not a recession. As someone who actually has a job, and is friends with actual rich people, I can tell you with reasonable confidence what's going on. \n\n1. Quarantine is awesome if you're rich, bc your life didn't change other than you now work from home. If you work. \n2. If you're rich, you want to get richer, and you are salty about the losses you took, and probably are putting **more money into securities now than you had in the market on Jan 1, 2020.** \n3. Many stocks are having a fire sale, and all we have to do to make money is pick some companies that got unfairly hammered by scared little bitch hedge fund managers who pulled their stake when things were uncertain. \n4. New York had an emergency, but many other US cities where rich people live did not. \n5. If you're running a company, or your wealth is sort of treated like a company, you are now keeping more cash on hand (less stonk buybacks), but this money is burning a hole in your pocket... so you keep using it to buy stonks. \n6. If you're rich, you're actually good at making money, so you are taking profits on your $W and $ZOOM positions, and are reinvesting in recovering stocks that have more growth potential in the medium term (end of year)\n   1. Once shit totally settles, lots of money probably goes back to indexes, but we're a long way from that. \n\nI say all this to tell r/wsb to stop thinking from their own perspective, and think like a rich person. Rich people buy securities. Poor people don't. None of the money that mattered has left the market (some of it is sitting as cash, but it's coming right back), and $6 trillion + is getting injected into the economy. It's a race back to 30,000, but individual stocks will recover value during different periods, as different sectors come online. \n\nSo what do you buy? Literally any stock that is undervalued. Here's a short list of the ones I made some money on ( can post screenshots but who cares honestly, this is easier to read):   \n\n\n* UBER - bought at $29.50, holding at \\~$33.50 now. Waiting for some volatility to explore call options\n* CHGG - sorry, this was just me being lucky - bought @ $33.50, sold at $60 (shares only, got cold feet before earnings)\n* ELY - bought and sold so many different plays... god I love golf. Currently holding shares with avg. basis of $13.00, just sold 6/19 $16 calls for 500% (0.15 per contract to 1.00 per)\n* YETI - bought \\~$24, holding at \\~$32 or whatever. Huge growth potential. Rich people buy expensive shit. \n\nJust look for things that sold off, and are on the path to their previous value - nothing really changed for many companies, except that their business was temporarily halted. The investors sold off too severely because everyone was expecting a crash for a long time. The crash is unpredictable. Maybe it happens. Probably it doesn't. If the US gov't has to build a country full of high speed rail lines to put people back to work, they will. There is no weirdness in the market. It's behaving exactly like a rich dad who got spooked by a virus. Initially held onto some cash, now slowly rolling it back in. \n\nTl;dr stocks are going to continue to go up, not all at once, so pick some good tickers and stop posting shitty memes", "id": "gscw4u", "created_utc": 1590693991.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "Honestly, I think this is spot on.\n\nI think BUD is a perfect example of something yet to recover, but will and will big.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "just checked that chart, I concur.
