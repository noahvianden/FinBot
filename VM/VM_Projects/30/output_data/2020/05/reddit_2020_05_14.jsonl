Say the expiration date is 6/19, that means at market close on 6/19, you can sell 100 shares of TSLA at $815.\n\nIf TSLA stock is above $815 on 6/19, the option expires worthless because you'd be selling at a loss. But you still paid $4,394, so it's a loss of $4,394.\n\nIf TSLA stock is below $815, you get $100 for each dollar it is below $815. So if it's $814, you'd sell for $815 per share netting you a profit of $100 on the sale but since you paid $4,394 for the contract, it would be a loss of $4,294.\n\nYou break even at $771.06 because the value of your option is the same as what you paid for it, $4,394.\n\nI just demonstrated intrinsic value, that is, the value of the option if it were to expire right now.\n\nThere's also extrinsic value, which includes TTM (time to maturity), and implied volatility (IV - how volatile TSLA stock is expected to be). The higher TTM and IV are, the higher your extrinsic value. The more volatile the stock is, the more likely it is to go deeper in the money. The longer until maturity you have, the more likely it is to go deeper in the money. This is why higher IV and longer dated options charge higher premiums.\n\nSo everyday, your TTM drops, thus lowering the extrinsic value of your option. If IV goes up, the extrinsic value goes up. If IV goes down, the extrinsic value goes down.\n\n**What happened to your TSLA put?** Well, since TTM always drops, that was a part of it. The closer dated your option is, the greater TTM will affect it on a per day basis. If it's dated for 1/2022, TTM won't drop the value much. But if it's dated 5/15/2020, TTM will drop it a ton each day. You also have IV, so if IV dropped a lot, the value of your option will drop a lot as it's less likely to get deep in the money.
