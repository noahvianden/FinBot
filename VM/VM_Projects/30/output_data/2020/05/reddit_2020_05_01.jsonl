I remember putting in my savings and making trades here and there, celebrating small gains and learning from losses. \n\nI was 100% stocks when everything started to crash. I was traveling in the US at the time, and away from my computer, which was at home. I remember being in the back seat of a car listening to George Bush addressing the nation, thinking how dumb I was for being fully invested. I resolved right then to not check my portfolio for the foreseeable future..... \n\nI cracked once a few weeks later, the value of my portfolio was so low I just closed out of the session in a small panic. \n\nTime passed and I ignored the whole thing. Got caught up in life. Even met my future wife. I remember her handing me the phone at my house (landline so anyone around would answer)... someone was calling from a group trying a hostile takeover for Neomaterial Technologies, which I had about 100 shares in. I bought at $4.45 and they were offering $2.50 or something, the current price was around $1. I said no thanks over the phone and the caller was quite annoyed with me. He said \u201cyou realize this is over double the market value\u201d. I thought to myself, if this guy is going to call me at my house and pay over double, then it\u2019s not worth a dollar, is it. That was the first bit of hope I had for my portfolio. \n\nAnother company I owned was a solar panel company called Timminco. I was perhaps a little excited about the potential of solar energy before the crash and had a 100 shares at about $30, which was pretty much peak bubble for that one. The whole thing was a scam and it was worthless by the time I did something about it. I eventually donated the shares back so I didn\u2019t have to look at my 100% loss every time I checked my portfolio. \n\nI also owned larger companies such as Apple. I used Apple computers at work and wanted to invest in something I was familiar with. I had no idea they were working on an iPhone and what that meant for my portfolio. But thanks to Apple, none of the other speculative holdings I was attempting to make money on before the crash  really mattered. Water under the bridge. \n\nA mentor of mine who got me into investing in the first place told me to just buy companies I think will still be in business in ten years and then just forget about them. That turned out to be solid advice. \n\nForgetting about them was the best thing I could have done. Looking back I perhaps wish I had some spare cash on the side for when the market tanked, but I have no idea if that would have worked out anyway... \u201cSpare cash\u201d in a downturn is not something you easily spend on stocks that might go down further.

There are two main factors here:\n\n1) Different states have different numbers of people, so we have to take the population into account to see how bad the virus situation is. California has about 50,000 cumulative confirmed cases, but an enormous population, nearly 40 million. The state of New York has about half as many people, but about 300,000 cumulative cases (that is, all the cases that have ever been confirmed - a lot of those people have recovered, so the number of current cases is smaller). So with half the population but 6 times the number of cases, things have been 12 times as bad in New York as they have been in California. (Or more, because the loading of hospitals was much worse in New York.) California's lockdown was early and more strict, which may have a lot to do with the difference in results.\n\n2) Remember that it takes up to a week or two (sometimes longer) for people who have been infected with COVID-19 to start showing symptoms (and another long time lag for sick people to die). So the number of new cases per day right now shows how many people got infected maybe about 10 days ago (and the number of new deaths right now relates to how many people got infected several weeks ago). \n\nThe mathematical models for control of an epidemic by social distancing indicate that the number of new cases starts small, rises very rapidly until the controls are put into place, then keeps rising for weeks (because of the number of people who had already been infected before the controls were put into place), then starts to level off and after a while drops rapidly.\n\nEven though California has a lot of Covid-19 cases and a lot of new cases per day and a lot of deaths, the mathematical models and the numbers of cases and deaths appear to show that California is now in the range where no more than a few hundred new infections are taking place per day (across the entire state!), and dropping rapidly, so that in a week or two the rate of new infections in California should be \"too low to track\". (If that's correct, we should soon be seeing a rapid drop in new cases, though they won't be \"near zero\" for a few weeks after that.)\n\nOf course the social distancing isn't perfect, and people will continue to bring in new cases from out of state, so the rate of new cases won't drop totally to zero. But at a very low new infection rate, the kinds of social distancing, detection, tracking, and sanitation techniques that Tesla has used successfully in Shanghai and proposes to use in  Fremont should work very well. Which is why Elon is extremely frustrated about the extended closure of the Fremont factory - opening it now (with the safety controls in the factory) would add very little risk to the employees and the public.\n\nTesla has been telling its Fremont employees that the furlough will continue for \"at least a week\", so maybe there has been some progress in the negotiations about the shutdown - a week or two extended shutdown would be much less hardship to Tesla than a month shutdown.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18838664889335632}], "tickers": ["tsla", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Well said.
