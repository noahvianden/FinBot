{"title": "Uber Earnings DD", "selftext": "Here's an interesting indicator for Ubers upcoming earnings. An Uber eats competitor (Foodora) has just up and left Canada with about two weeks notice, citing profitability issues [CBC News article] (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbc.ca/amp/1.5546642). Note they indicate the competitive landscape is rough in Canada. This is no different than the US with the exact same players everywhere. And Foodora operated a lot out of major cities that are similar in size and density to US cities (Toronto, Montreal). I believe this is a great indicator of upcoming shittier-news-than-expected for Ubers earnings call. \n\nNow seeing as how Uber eats is one of the only theorized things to be making money for Uber these days, they are clearly suffering what Amazon is in that revenue may be there (maybe it isn't even there really), but profit isn't. Earnings are may 7th and it should drill to 25 I would say if earnings miss something like 30%+ from revised consensus. Now I know I will catch some \"priced in\" shade, but the market is irrational right now and the stock is irrationally high for a company that already lost fuck tons of money under normal circumstances, and now can't get any fucking volume. \n\nFor the ambitious it might even drop to 22.5 given the absolute fallout this upcoming earnings will have. They are so fucking junk grade that I don't even know if pow pow would print for their bonds. \n\nTLDR: $UBER 25p 05/08.\n\nEdit: added context to the link between the two and minor shit\n\nEdit: there's been some shade about using the Canadian market as an indicator...think size guys.

If you saw a post saying doordash couldn't make a profit in Chicago or Philly, you would be like oh fuck maybe I'll short skip. It's the same fucking thing guys....

Preferably on a company with a cheap underlying...and a business that even wsb can comprehend?\n\n$TACO (Del Taco) reports earnings on Monday AMC, here is why it\u2019s going up and how to play it:\n\n1) QSRs (quick service restaurants) will benefit disproportionally from pandemic per several studies\n\n2) 99% of del taco restaurants have drive thrus, per 10-K. Per company statement on 4/2, 85% of their sales PRE corona were from drive through + takeout\n\n3) MEANINGFUL insider buying before and after pandemic, and mgmt team increasingly focused on execution. mgmt team is aligned with shareholders and has said theyre willing to sell company if opportunity presents itself. (I\u2019m not banking on this short term but it\u2019s cheap and attractive business (ill get to this in moment)). also mgmt team came out last week and said theyre all taking 20% pay cuts. they\u2019d rather the stock go up.\n\n4) CHEAP STOCK. $189M market cap was valued by PE at $500M a few years ago. p/b of 0.65, forward p/e 14, little l/t debt, strong fcf \n\n5) strong customer base that loves the food. go on twitter and reddit and search del taco. look at google trends and search glassdoor reviews. loyal customers. Lot of Glassdoor reviews saying it\u2019s always busy and understaffed\n\n6) increased and timely marketing that will finally present itself in q1. They introduced the app and have been pumping coupons since start of 2020. and it will drive sales. Also go on youtube and look up del taco on SNL; the skit with Adam Driver is actually fucking funny and it was the first SNL skit of 2020. effective marketing is effective. AW MAN IM ALL OUT OF CASH\n\n7) they have already pulled guidance which dropped stock, should fall even if bad er\n\n8) other random thoughts: stock doesnt screen well (go on finviz youll see comps missing). everyone loves tacos, there arent many fast food mexican restaurants in USA, there\u2019s really just taco bell and i suppose cmg. also the demographic market of the chain (southwest and west coast) increases effectiveness of branding and helps the growth argument throughout country. also the mgt team has been closing restaurants that arent profitable since last year, this will help bottom line and tailwind going forward \n\nTLDR: everybody loves cheap tacos, tendies will rain on cinco de mayo. $TACO calls\n\n$TACO 7.5c 6/19\n$TACO 10c 9/18\n$TACO shares for the r/investing lurkers\n\nEDIT: Grammar\nEDIT 2: ER is Monday AMC", "id": "gc92qt", "created_utc": 1588436129.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 40, "comments": [{"body": "DD with no links?

And it\u2019s small cap but the franchise is not irrelevant like pbpb or similar chains that will inevitably head to $0 imo (absent mgmt turnaround). \n\nBut from a share price perspective and technicals, I still think this is a good entry after it dropped nearly $1 the past couple days. 52-week high was $13.50, and there was insider buying between $7-8 which is clearly a good sign. It\u2019s traded in downward channel past couple years but was flat from nov til March, so I think it was basically a \u201cshow me\u201d story from the market before doing anything.
