Does it mean that the price of tesla will increase from now until 12/21, because people will be buying now knowing that institutions will have to buy a lot of tesla stock starting on 12/21? And that the tesla stock price will probably continue to rise for a few days after 12/21 as these firms continue to buy the shares that they need?\n\n3. So does this basically mean that the company that is named on 12/11 will experience an immediate price drop on that date since the general public will sell it in anticipation of a sell off coming frominstitutional firms of that stock in order to make room to add tesla instead on 12/21 (an early sell off)?\n\nthanks all\n\nSo: buy tesla now and sell on 12/21?

But thousands of other people are thinking the same thing you are, making it unlikely.  Even worse, there are groups of very smart people who do nothing but look for high probability profit situations to jump on them.  These people have billions of dollars at their disposal to make bets when they see them.

Firms will just be buying existing shares of stock.  Subsequently, the price will continue climbing as demand increases.

Right now it\u2019s mostly private investors and investment companies trying to profit from the inclusion, but the higher the price goes the less these groups are interested because there\u2019s less potential profit, thus the price flattens out and falls as people or companies decide that the stock is maxed out, or just high enough for them, and they take their profits.

The flood of supply on the market will cause the price to plummet and make it more than possible for index funds to find enough shares to track the fund.\n\n3:  Yes.  There will be a two-step drop for whatever company is removed from the index.  As with Tesla the first drop will be on the 11th when the private and corporate investors try to beat everyone else out the door before the price drops.

VALE, however, has been solidly rising every single day.\n\nI think VALE is the next meme stock because (1): VALE has the largest supply of materials used to make electric batteries and (2) the market for EV's is starting to become oversaturated. People haven't even taken into account the main name brand automakers that are adding more EV's to their fleet or converting current vehicles. So while there is only room for a specific amount of players and their is a \"cap\" on the market, as most Americans only own one vehicle, the inherent value of materials and batteries are unlimited, as every EV will need them.\n\nLong story short, why gamble on specific EV names when there will only be a few winners? The true winners will be the supply chain that has a death grip on those industries regardless if it's Tesla, NIO, Toyota, GM, or Xpeng. At end of the day, the winner will be TSLA and the automakers people are already familiar with: Toyota, Honda, Ford, GM, etc. Not some obscure name like SOLO that operates out of a mall kiosk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVote to keep this post, otherwise the stupid mods will delete it.
