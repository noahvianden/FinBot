{"title": "Buying options after market drops with large IV spike", "selftext": "So I have a question about buying options when the market drops significantly but IV spikes. Is there ever a situation where this is viable?\n\nLet's take 3/23 of this year where we saw the lowest point in the S&P 500. IV had spiked to incredibly high rates but over the following months we saw a huge recovery. What would have been the best move here? Would buying LEAPS have been a smart decision? Waiting a few weeks for IV to drop more? Or perhaps buying straight shares?\n\nIf anyone can provide some examples or data to help me understand this concept I would be grateful. Thanks!\n\nEDIT: After looking at some active calls I see LEAPS would have been a pretty good option. This must be because the delta outweighed the vega. I suppose short term calls of 2-3 months would be an interesting view, but I'm thinking maybe delta and theta are really the biggest players", "id": "kd2hdg", "created_utc": 1607968236.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 34, "comments": [{"body": "A large spike in IV makes option prices higher.

The 1x2 has a much lower break-even point, which is great for hedging.\n2. The 1x2 has a larger limited profit (like 65% more).\n\nWould you say that lines up with your experience?

Think of a stock + 1x2 call spread as 2 separate positions --> Stock w/ an overwrite + a regular call spread.\n\nThe overwrite leg helps reduce the cost of the overall call spread at the expense of overwriting your stock.  \n\nWhen you think about a call spread, you think about your max profit as being the width of the spread typically.  I buy a $5 point call spread for 1.00, i make max $4 profit (5 - 1 cost).  With a 1x2 you can think of your profit as a \"zone\".  A triangular landing strip if you will.  You make the max profit right a your short strike, and it tails back off as you go through, ultimately going back to 0 profit at your 2nd breakeven.  So there are 2 breakevens to a 1x2 call spread - the point at which you *start* making money (traditional breakeven) and the point at which you *stop* making money. \n\nAn easy way to think about this is lets say you paid $0.50 for a 10-15 1x2 call spread.  max profit? (15-10-0.50= 4.50).  2nd breakeven? add you max profit to the top strike --> 15 + 4.50 = 19.50.  your 2 breakevens are 10.50 and 19.50.  you are profitable anywhere in between.  Don't get too caught up about going thru short strike.  if it landed at 16, you still were profitable ($5 of value in the 10-15 1x1, less 0.50 original cost, less the $1 you lost in the extra overwrite leg = 3.50 of profit)\n\nThis is why i say in times of high vol i look for suuuuper wide 1x2s.

{"title": "Market Recap - Monday, December 14, 2020", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, December 14, 2020**\n\nThe S&P 500 and the Dow Jones pulled back Monday, with market participants closely monitoring the rollout of Pfizer\u2019s (PFE) vaccine in the US and stimulus negotiations in Washington. The tech-heavy Nasdaq outperformed the other indices, finishing the day roughly 0.5% up. \n\nOver the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s coronavirus vaccine for use in individuals aged 16 and older. Distribution of the vaccine is scheduled to start today and will prioritize frontline health care workers and nursing-home residents. . In response to the vaccine news, analysts at Bank of America said, \u201cWith the vaccine now shipping, we expect greater reaction from the broader market over the potential return to normal. However, we caution much work remains to vaccine the population and don\u2019t expect to see major progress until mid-2021.\u201d In order to safely and fully reopen the economy and return to some semblance of normalcy, a safe and efficient vaccine is required. That said, widespread distribution of the vaccine is likely to take a few months, so until then we must all continue to do our part to flatten the curve. , Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) said, \u201cThe reality is December and January and February are going to be rough times. I actually believe they\u2019re going to be the most difficult in the public health history of this nation, largely because of the stress that\u2019s going to be put on our health-care system.\u201d\n\nModerna\u2019s (MRNA) vaccine, which uses similar technology to Pfizer\u2019s, is under review with the FDA as well and could be granted authorization in the coming days. The company first filed its request for emergency use authorization in late November, about one week after Pfizer\u2019s request. The U.S. government on Friday said it doubled its orders of Moderna\u2019s vaccine to 200 million.\n\nToday, a group of bipartisan lawmakers unveiled the specific language of their $908 billion stimulus package proposed last week. The proposal will be composed of two different bills. One will include $748 billion for the vaccine rollout, aid for small businesses, and enhanced unemployment benefits. The $160 billion proposal includes aid for state and local governments and liability protections for businesses. Here at Psycho, we think it is extremely unlikely any sort that any sort of stimulus will pass through the Senate until after Georgia\u2019s election and the Biden Administration takes power.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* After a monster day on Friday, Disney (DIS) pulled back around 3.5% today. \n* NIO recently signed an agreement with a state-woned electric grid company in China to construct 100 battery charging and swapping station in 2021.\n* More than a dozen Google services, including Gmail and YouTube, were experiencing issues Monday morning, interrupting access for individuals and businesses.\n* United Health Group target raised by SVB Leerik from $378 to $390 OUTPERFORM.

It's a discounted stock at the moment. Wait to see what it does market open. Could dip farther. But the tightness of the candles show that the investors picked bottom value for the shares. Look at wednesdays tightness before the jump thursday.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/PyuHoKJ](https://imgur.com/a/PyuHoKJ)\n\n2) $ZNGA - ZANGA\n\nTrends are pointing up right now. More gains this week. Once again look at the investors coming in after the dip. They know the stocks undervalued. It's trending up. Wait for a good entry point. Trend points up!\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RoxWfTJ](https://imgur.com/a/RoxWfTJ)\n\n3) $M ->MACYS ( Very sure on this one )\n\nMight go red for a day or two before it jumps back. Watch for the trend setting back up to reach 12$. 10% Increase EOW isn't unlikely here. These stocks are at a discount right now. Could go lower. Buy around 11$ depending on the first 3 hours monday. You should be able to decide if its green or red by then. If the swings are crazy though don't buy just yet. But it looks tight after that last dip Friday. Really good sign before a nice climb up.\n\n(YEAR) [https://imgur.com/a/clirf5x](https://imgur.com/a/clirf5x) (Notice the yellow? Thats people realizing how undervalued this stock is.

{"title": "Popular Contracts on Reddit 12/18... What to sell this week?", "selftext": "As the side bar of this subreddit says \"We are selling options to WSB degenerate using #thetagang strategie!\".  I think the data I am collecting will be interesting to many of the members here. \n\nI have been analyzing comments and posts on reddit to determine what stocks are mentioned the most. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits we track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/18.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 12/04 \u2013 12/10.  For Friday\u2019s expiration there are 448 contracts and 714 mentions of these contracts.  Quite an increase from last week which is pretty exciting.  Though, I mostly attribute this to improvements in the machine learning models we are using to identify stocks and contracts.  The most popular contracts this week are the PLTR 30 Call and the LAZR 30 Put.  \n\nThe goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF\u2019s such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index\u2019s year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  \n\nAs of week 1, I would have profited $1710 betting against reddit [Last Weeks Recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers/comments/kbcc6x/weekly_results_what_if_you_sold_the_most_popular/).  I will continue to track my progress each week. \n\nI just want to emphasize it does not matter if I am right or wrong.  More importantly this research is to identify if there are any trends worth following. \n\nCall Data\n\n* Out of the 448 contracts 356 are calls (80% Long)  \n* 70.8% of the calls are out of the money\n* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. \n* The in the money calls are an average of 26% in the money. \n\nPut Data\n\n* Out of 448 Contracts 92 are puts\n* 67.4% of the puts are out of the money\n* The out of the money puts are an average of 18.7% out of the money\n* The in the money puts are an average of 22% in the money \n\nOn both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 448 contracts only 134 are in the money as of last Friday\u2019s close. \n\nThe most popular calls that are in the money are: \n\n* PLTR 20, 22, 26 \n* TSLA 600 \n \n\nThe most popular puts that are in the money are: \n\n* LAZR 30\n* CRSR 35.  \n\nThe most popular calls that are out of the money are \n\n* PLTR 30, 32, 35 \n* TSLA 630, 650, 700\n* ARKG 100\n* NIO 50 \n* SPY 380\n\nThe most popular puts that are out of the money are:\n\n* LAZR 25, 20\n* SPY 350\n* PLTR 25, 26\n* SNOW 330\n\nMy hypothesis is that the majority of these contracts will be losers.  Based on the data I would be looking to sell the PLTR 32 and TSLA 630 calls and LAZR 20 / 25 Puts. I will update with the premium prices first thing tomorrow morning at market open.\n\nEdit:\n\n[Data updated daily](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers) Got a few questions about data via DM.

I buy a $5 point call spread for 1.00, i make max $4 profit (5 - 1 cost).  With a 1x2 you can think of your profit as a \"zone\".  A triangular landing strip if you will.  You make the max profit right a your short strike, and it tails back off as you go through, ultimately going back to 0 profit at your 2nd breakeven.  So there are 2 breakevens to a 1x2 call spread - the point at which you *start* making money (traditional breakeven) and the point at which you *stop* making money. \n\nAn easy way to think about this is lets say you paid $0.50 for a 10-15 1x2 call spread.  max profit? (15-10-0.50= 4.50).  2nd breakeven? add you max profit to the top strike --> 15 + 4.50 = 19.50.  your 2 breakevens are 10.50 and 19.50.  you are profitable anywhere in between.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq outperformed the other indices, finishing the day roughly 0.5% up. \n\nOver the weekend, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization to Pfizer and BioNTech\u2019s coronavirus vaccine for use in individuals aged 16 and older. Distribution of the vaccine is scheduled to start today and will prioritize frontline health care workers and nursing-home residents. . In response to the vaccine news, analysts at Bank of America said, \u201cWith the vaccine now shipping, we expect greater reaction from the broader market over the potential return to normal. However, we caution much work remains to vaccine the population and don\u2019t expect to see major progress until mid-2021.\u201d In order to safely and fully reopen the economy and return to some semblance of normalcy, a safe and efficient vaccine is required. That said, widespread distribution of the vaccine is likely to take a few months, so until then we must all continue to do our part to flatten the curve. , Dr. Robert Redfield, the Director of the Center for Disease Control (CDC) said, \u201cThe reality is December and January and February are going to be rough times. I actually believe they\u2019re going to be the most difficult in the public health history of this nation, largely because of the stress that\u2019s going to be put on our health-care system.\u201d\n\nModerna\u2019s (MRNA) vaccine, which uses similar technology to Pfizer\u2019s, is under review with the FDA as well and could be granted authorization in the coming days.

They loved eating out, watching a movie at the cinema, and taking their kids out to play at $PLAY while they sit back and enjoy a beer.\n\nThese feelings haven't changed.

{"title": "Popular Contracts on Reddit 12/18... What to sell this week?", "selftext": "As the side bar of this subreddit says \"We are selling options to WSB degenerate using #thetagang strategie!\".  I think the data I am collecting will be interesting to many of the members here. \n\nI have been analyzing comments and posts on reddit to determine what stocks are mentioned the most. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits we track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/18.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 12/04 \u2013 12/10.  For Friday\u2019s expiration there are 448 contracts and 714 mentions of these contracts.  Quite an increase from last week which is pretty exciting.  Though, I mostly attribute this to improvements in the machine learning models we are using to identify stocks and contracts.  The most popular contracts this week are the PLTR 30 Call and the LAZR 30 Put.  \n\nThe goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF\u2019s such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index\u2019s year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  \n\nAs of week 1, I would have profited $1710 betting against reddit [Last Weeks Recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers/comments/kbcc6x/weekly_results_what_if_you_sold_the_most_popular/).  I will continue to track my progress each week. \n\nI just want to emphasize it does not matter if I am right or wrong.  More importantly this research is to identify if there are any trends worth following. \n\nCall Data\n\n* Out of the 448 contracts 356 are calls (80% Long)  \n* 70.8% of the calls are out of the money\n* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. \n* The in the money calls are an average of 26% in the money. \n\nPut Data\n\n* Out of 448 Contracts 92 are puts\n* 67.4% of the puts are out of the money\n* The out of the money puts are an average of 18.7% out of the money\n* The in the money puts are an average of 22% in the money \n\nOn both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 448 contracts only 134 are in the money as of last Friday\u2019s close. \n\nThe most popular calls that are in the money are: \n\n* PLTR 20, 22, 26 \n* TSLA 600 \n \n\nThe most popular puts that are in the money are: \n\n* LAZR 30\n* CRSR 35.  \n\nThe most popular calls that are out of the money are \n\n* PLTR 30, 32, 35 \n* TSLA 630, 650, 700\n* ARKG 100\n* NIO 50 \n* SPY 380\n\nThe most popular puts that are out of the money are:\n\n* LAZR 25, 20\n* SPY 350\n* PLTR 25, 26\n* SNOW 330\n\nMy hypothesis is that the majority of these contracts will be losers.  Based on the data I would be looking to sell the PLTR 32 and TSLA 630 calls and LAZR 20 / 25 Puts. I will update with the premium prices first thing tomorrow morning at market open.\n\nEdit:\n\n[Data updated daily](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers) Got a few questions about data via DM.  If you are interested in more frequent updates.\n\nPremium As of 11:A.M. Monday Morning:\n\n* TSLA 630 $3710\n* PLTR $40\n\n* LAZR 25 $130\n* LAZR 20 $ 20", "id": "kcn7w3", "created_utc": 1607908060.0, "score": 100, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 36, "comments": [{"body": "Selling Tesla options this week seems risky.
