It immediately pulled back to $60 and then at noon pulled back to $55, which is where I sold a -40p+25p spread that expired that week, for 0.68.  My logic was that even if the stock did nothing but pull back for the rest of the week it would probably still end above $40.  I ended up buying back the spread the next day for 0.10.  (Well, technically I only bought back the short put, the 25p was unsellable.)\n\nIf you're careful about the strikes of the puts you sell your only real risk should be tail risk... in the ARVN example if it had come out that the results had been falsified the stock could have dropped like a rock and I would have had to eat maximum loss.  That said, the reversal would have to happen fast, because I usually take my profit within a day or three.\n\nAn extra warning: don't do this if you don't know why the stock pumped, and you need to think the pump was for a good reason.

{"title": "VMware (VMW) Exploit Chaining in Combination with SolarWinds (SWI), What Does It Mean for Investors? CVE-2020-13169 and CVE-2020-14005", "selftext": "**TLDR**\n\nThe first impact on VMware (VMW) was Friday when Brian Krebs (World renowned Cyber Security Investigative Reporter known for highly effective campaigns in tracking and neutralizing cybercriminal threats) tied the SolarWinds (SWI) based hacks to the VMware vulnerabilities reported by the NSA. This combination of capabilities explains persistence and how it was formed.\n\nVMware (VMW) dropped 5.6% by end of day after the publication of the Krebs article.\n\n[https://www.barrons.com/articles/vmware-stock-falls-as-report-links-its-software-to-solarwinds-hack-51608327990](https://www.barrons.com/articles/vmware-stock-falls-as-report-links-its-software-to-solarwinds-hack-51608327990)\n\nPatches already exist but VMware has found itself thrown into the fire of the SolarWinds hack. At this point since VMware was not a victim, but instead a utility, they may find themselves following the downward path of SolarWinds as the reputation of their Identity Management products takes a beating. 5.6% may be the beginning of a weeks long drop as customers reassess their ties to VMware identity management products and investors panic on the correlation to the SolarWinds hack.\n\n**What is VMware?**\n\nVMware provides the worlds premier virtualization software. \"VMware, Inc. engages in the provision of cloud infrastructure and business mobility. Its products include Software-Defined Data Center, Hybrid Cloud Computing, and End-User Computing. It supports modernizing data centers, integrating public clouds, empowering digital workspaces and transforming security.\" -Forbes\n\n**Who uses VMware?**\n\n\"More than 500,000 customers of all sizes have chosen VMware as their virtualization platform, including\n\n\u2022 99 percent of Fortune 100 companies  \n\u2022 99 percent of Fortune 500 companies  \n\u2022 100 percent of Fortune Global 100 companies \u2022 99 percent of Fortune Global 500 companies\"\n\n[https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/whitepaper/vmware-advantage.pdf/subassets/page15.pdf](https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/whitepaper/vmware-advantage.pdf/subassets/page15.pdf)\n\nVMware is also GSA approved and distributed through Dell (DELL), Carahsoft, and Ingram Micro/Promark and used by all levels of government and the US military.\n\n[https://www.vmware.com/solutions/industry/government/federal-government-it-solutions.html](https://www.vmware.com/solutions/industry/government/federal-government-it-solutions.html)\n\n**Who discovered the latest VMware vulnerabilities?**\n\nThe vulnerabilities were disclosed to VMware by the NSA. VMware subsequently disclosed to the public.\n\n**What was the major exploit within VMware products?**\n\n\"A malicious actor with network access to the administrative configurator on port 8443 and a valid password for the configurator admin account can execute commands with unrestricted privileges on the underlying operating system.\"\n\n[https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0027.html](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2020-0027.html)\n\n**How would someone be able to accomplish the exploit?**\n\nYou may be asking, how could someone accomplish a login to the administrative port of a VMware configuration with a valid password?\n\nWell this is simple, SolarWinds Orion stores and utilizes the adequate credentials to monitor and maintain all devices placed within it's scope......including your VMware entities.\n\n[https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success\\_Center/orionplatform/Content/Core-Adding-VMware-Servers-for-Monitoring-sw89.htm](https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/orionplatform/Content/Core-Adding-VMware-Servers-for-Monitoring-sw89.htm)\n\n**So the VMware has been compromised, what can they really do?**\n\nThrough VMware Workspace One Access and VMware Identity Manager the actor is able to create unauthorized but VALID SAML tokens which enable authentication to network resources. Once an administrative level authentication is established to resources such as Active Directory the actor is able to create persistence.\n\n\"It is critical when running products that perform authentication that the server and all the services that depend on it are properly configured for secure operation and integration. Otherwise, SAML assertions could be forged, granting access to numerous resources. If integrating authentication servers with ADFS, NSA recommends following Microsoft\u2019s best practices, especially for securing SAML assertions and requiring multi-factor authentication\"\n\n[https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/07/2002547071/-1/-1/0/CSA\\_VMWARE%20ACCESS\\_U\\_OO\\_195076\\_20.PDF](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/07/2002547071/-1/-1/0/CSA_VMWARE%20ACCESS_U_OO_195076_20.PDF)\n\n**But did it really happen this way? Were the exploits chained?**\n\nIt seems so from all assessments. For all authenticators that could not be harvested from within SolarWinds, in the condition of existence of VMware Workspace One Access and VMware Identity Manager served as the final hurdle to full domain control.\n\n\"The exploitation occurs after the actors have gained initial access to a victim\u2019s on-premises network. The actors leverage privileged access in the on-premises environment to subvert the mechanisms that the organization uses to grant access to cloud and on-premises resources and/or to compromise administrator credentials with the ability to manage cloud resources.\"\n\n\"In the first Tactics Techniques and Procedures, the actors compromise on-premises components of a federated SSO infrastructure and steal the credential or private key that is used to sign Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens (TA00061, T1552, T1552.004). Using the private keys, the actors then forge trusted authentication tokens to access cloud resources. A recent NSA Cybersecurity Advisory warned of actors exploiting a vulnerability in VMware Access\u00ae2 and VMware Identity Manager\u00ae3 that allowed them to perform this Tactics Techniques and Procedures and abuse federated SSO infrastructure\"\n\n\"Regardless of how the initial on-premises compromise occurred, detecting authentication abuse can aid in detecting the compromise and even contain it if responded to quickly enough. The recent SolarWinds Orion\u00ae9 code compromise is one serious example of how on-premises systems can be compromised leading to abuse of federated authentication and malicious cloud access\"\n\n[https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/17/2002554125/-1/-1/0/AUTHENTICATION\\_MECHANISMS\\_CSA\\_U\\_OO\\_198854\\_20.PDF](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Dec/17/2002554125/-1/-1/0/AUTHENTICATION_MECHANISMS_CSA_U_OO_198854_20.PDF)\n\n**Why would this shift VMware (VMW) stock price down if there is already a patch?**\n\nVMware has gone from having patched an exploit disclosed to them by the NSA, to having been placed in the spotlight of previous and current utility by those that exploited the SolarWinds hack.\n\nThe NSA had already written very detailed documentation of how the VMware and SolarWinds exploits chained together but it had not proven digestible to most.\n\nAfter Krebs wrote his article it brought up questions within consumers of VMware products of why they needed their version of identify as a service (IDaaS) for their single sign-on. This sentiment moved forward into investors and we saw a 5.6% drop in VMware (VMW) stock by end of day.\n\nIt is highly likely that as SolarWinds falls on news of the hack that now that VMware has been identified in the same exploit chain they may fall with it.\n\nWMware thankfully were quick to disclose their own vulnerability, and none of their board attempted to exit their positions before that disclosure. This is the opposite of what had been done by SolarWinds, with whom they have now been linked by technical means.\n\nWe may see a further fall in VMware stock price on Monday and throughout the upcoming weeks as a result of the above information.\n\n**Updates will come.**\n\nAs updates become available they will be posted here, either as edits or links to independent posts.\n\nThis post welcomes comments both technical and layman\u2019s level.
