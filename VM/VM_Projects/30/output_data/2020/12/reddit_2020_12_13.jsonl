{"title": "The Week Ahead: Playing FOMC meeting amidst a bunch of other stuff happening (SPY, VXX, TLT)", "selftext": "**For months now, each meeting of the FED and Jerome Powell speech has stated the same things in varied terms:** 1) We are not raising interest rates 2) We really, really need a congressional stimulus and 3) Yes we are deep in our fucking bag, but we still got Qauntitiative Easing tools, so don't sleep\n\nGiven this repetitiveness of guidance, you'd assume the FOMC meetings to come are just boring ass affairs.  But, if you dig a little deeper into the nerdom, there are specific, subtle reasons this meeting in particular could have a huge affect on quantitative easing measures and the broader market, including SPY.\n\n**I\u2019m particularly viewing this through the lens of Federal Reserve pushback to Treasury and Congress**. His rhetoric has been clear; \u2018we have done what we are going to do, for now, and the onus for a healthy economy is on the fiscal stimulus.  Our measures designed to be a temporary stopgap, not polic\u2019 Yet the treasury and congress haven\u2019t done their part. But his response choices do exist; and are more subtly complex than it may seem.  Let's take a journey through QE, and what the options are at the FOMC.\n\nThe first thing to understand is what the 2 popularized big guns of QE are, and that it is very, very unlikely we're going to see change to them.\n\n**1) The lowering of the Federals funds rate**\n*Current: ~0 (.25%, goal between 0 and .25%)*\n*Last year this time: 1.75%*\n**Any likely changes?** Hell no\nGood news is that the Fed rate is obviously not increasing, as Powell has made it clear this isn't even on the table until 2023.  The other option--a negative federal interest rate--is also unlikely.  Not solely because of the fact that it's a tool to be saved for a much more distressed market, but because it would signal a level of panic that the Fed would see as a detrement to the markets, particularly heading into the new year.\n**MM quote:**\n>... the Fed will leave the Fed funds target rate at 0-0.25% next Wednesday, promising to keep it there until the goal of maximum employment and inflation being \u201con track to moderately exceed 2% for some time\u201d is met \u2013 their \u201cdot\u201d diagram will continue to suggest this won\u2019t happen before 2023.\n\n[MORE HERE](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/fundamental/forecast/weekly/usd/2020/12/13/US-Dollar-Outlook-Hinges-on-Federal-Reserve-Interest-Rate-Decision.html)\n\n**2) Expansion of Fed asset purchases**\n*Current: $120B (80B of treasuries purchases, 40B of Mortgage-backed securities)*\nThis has been the Fed's most powerful tool in stimulating the markets, particularly the treasuries.  More on this type of activity here [DD link], but the long and short of it is that the more treasuries the Fed purchases, the more market participants are pressured to buy stonks instead of bonds.\n**Any likely changes?** Probably not.\nGiven that the stimulus talks are stalling for like the 70th time while COVID cases are rising and important economic factors like weekly jobs numbers are tanking,  there *has* been reserved optimism that the Fed could decide to expand it's balance sheet on asset purchases.  The overall sentiment, however, is that its unlikely to see an expansion for the same reason we won't see a change to the Federal interest rate: the desire not to create panic at such a sensitive time for the markets.\n**MM quote:**\n>\tThey have to get incrementally more dovish next week...Increasing the size of QE might send a little more alarming signal than they would like to take at this moment.\u201d\n\n[MORE HERE](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/heres-everything-the-federal-reserve-could-do-at-its-policy-meeting-next-week.html)\n\n**So, if these changes are unlikely, what are the options left, then?**  They are subtle, but important; two FOMC factors that may not make a huge splash in the news, but could make a huge splash in the markets.\n\n**1) Tweaking which treasuries they purchase, shuffling around the 80B to longer dated maturities:**\nThe Fed could decide to fuck around with the steepening yield curve.  By moving their purchases to more longer dated bond maturities (for example, shifting more of the 80B QE fund to purchasing 20/30 year maturity bonds instead of 10) they could end up providing a fairly large boost to stonk buying without actually spending more money overall on the balance sheet.  There is chatter that the Fed wants to do whatever is possible to keep yields on the 20 at 1% or lower, and this move could do it.\n**Is this likely to happen?** 50/50\nSome market watchers think it will happen because the factors mentioned earlier necessitate it (stimulus deadlock, virus uptick, struggling jobs numbers).  Yes, there is a vaccine coming, but the market has to *survive* in the meantime, and a lot of factors are stacked against it.\n**Do I think it will happen?**Probably not.  \nI don\u2019t think the Fed wants to roil the treasuries market around the holidays, AND would want to stay hands off with stimulus talks ongoing while this meeting is taking place\u2014the Fed wants, and needs, to put pressure on congress for fiscal stimulus and leaving the yield curve untouched will do that.  Any further yield curve tinkering will signal to congress that help is there for their precious stonks wiht or without the stimulus passing.  If stimmy talks fail again, though, I definitely think this could come to fruition at the January meeting.\nMM quote:\n>A number of economists believe that the Fed should tamp down on any further steepening of the U.S. Treasury yield curve by shifting the focus of its purchases to longer-dated bonds from shorter-dated instruments.\n\n**2) Outcome-based guidance:**\nThis term sounds like bullshit but it is not.  This essentially means \u201cthe Fed will peg QE measures 2021 to how the economy is performing, on this predetermined scale\u201d  The reason it\u2019s not bullshit is because, without discussing the Federal funds rate, it gives both the public and (probably more importantly) Congress an idea of what kind of footing the economy needs to be on, by when, and how the Fed will respond.\n**Is this lilkely to happen?** Yes.  \nMost market watchers are expecting some sort of firm guidance to show us where we could go in 2021.\n**Do I think it will happen? ** Yes.  \nI think, [especially after the Treasury started beef with the Fed by putting an end to critical crises-era programs ](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/treasury-seeks-to-extend-some-emergency-fed-programs-but-end-others-including-main-street-facility.html), the Fed is going to pushback by tying the Fed\u2019\u2019 programming to economic indicators which can be largely effected by fiscal stimulus.  There is more the Fed can do, as they\u2019\u2019e stated many times, but at this point our growing economic woes are self-inflicted, and I expect guidance to reflect that.\nMM quote:\n>We could see a change in guidance relating to the asset purchases, which currently stand at $80bn of Treasuries and $40bn of Mortgage Backed Securities each month. At present they merely comment that \u201cover coming months\u201d the purchases will continue \u201cat least at the current pace\u201d. Officials have hinted they could make the pace of purchases more conditional on economic conditions. \n\n[MORE HERE](https://think.ing.com/articles/us-what-to-expect-from-the-december-fomc-meeting/)\n\n**Conclusions I\u2019m drawing:**\nI don\u2019t think the Fed is offering shit in terms of solid market help through, really, the only potential way it would\u2014\u2014a shift into purchasing a larger amount of longer-dated maturities within the current 80B treasury purchase budget.  It seems like the market, from a lot of articles I\u2019ve read, is holding out hope on that (especially in light of worsening conditions), so if it doesn\u2019t happen we definitely got a dip coming.\n\n**I\u2019m viewing the importance of this meeting in the context of several problematic outside factors\u2014stimulus talks stalling, Brexit and the Europoors on they full Oliver Twist rn, and terrible job numbers likely coming this week.**  I know PFE was given the go-ahead this weekend, but I don\u2019t have much confidence in that carrying us much past the likely green Monday with such a turbulent week ahead (my 367c 12/14 im bagholding certainly fucking hope so on the Monday part).\n\nSPY is already unperforming by typical December standards, and certainly by the year\u2019s insane standard. **So then, by my logic, market momentum truly becomes an issue of two factors: FOMC meeting results, and the stimulus talks going well.  I will be the first to admit that my optimism on the stimulus is seeming increasingly incorrect**, and I\u2019m growing doubtful it will be finished next week\u2014though there will be lots of little meaningless \u201ctalk\u201c going well\u201d pum\u201ds.\n*The questions is\u2014will\u2014Pow and the FED use their big, swinging QE tools to save EOY market optimism during this FOMC meeting? For me, the signs point to no.*\n\n**Positions**\nI know I know, I literally just said I hate VIX and have broken up with it, but I took another look, and rethought about it\u2019s purpose.  **I do believe by Tuesday, especially assuming we are green-ish or flat Monday, **there will be a spike in options premiums in preparation for the FOMC and Stimulus shenanigans.

{"title": "PYPL/SQ/ARKF fintech DD", "selftext": "Paypal was an early COVID investing pick due to its nature of contactless payments and its rise in young populations with Venmo. Paypal has a storied history, founded by some of the most influential Silicon Valley VC\u2019s and entrepreneurs they started as two smaller companies founded in the middle of the tech bubble (1998 and 1999) as Confinity and X.com by Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. They were able to weather the storm of the 2000 tech fallout by being bought out by eBay for $1.5B beforehand. Under eBay, Paypal grew their services into what most of us know them for: digitized payments. Starting from effortless check transfers for unauthorized vendors to working their way to B(!)tcoin, Paypal has made it more convenient for payments to be processed, and in our consumerist economy that\u2019s an absolute goldmine. Square is a relatively new player in the digital transaction space but they\u2019ve had quite a run up this year under the leadership of Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter. Their first product was a card reader that fit into the headphone jack of smartphones, so naturally Square expanded into the enterprise services market and continued developing solutions for small businesses like payroll management. I\u2019ll further discuss the respective structures of both companies in this due diligence\n\n**The Expansion of Digital Transactions**\n\nPaper currency has been the standard means of exchange for ages, but the digital method of exchange, particularly mobile exchanges has now become far more convenient. In 2017, digital payments were expected to reach a market value of [$726B](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/09/digital-payments-expected-to-hit-726-billion-by-2020-study-finds.html) in 2020, and here we are post covid with the value of digital payments at over 910B.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mr9elex5z0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=18e6eb1b9039d738af6c2ea5277018d2749cbbfd\n\nStatista forecasts that most of the sales growth for digitized payments past 2020 will come from mobile POS, and that most of the user growth for digitized payments will also be in peer-to-peer transactions. Paypal has both bases covered with Venmo when it comes to mobile transactions and it has E-Commerce covered with its major retailer partnerships and with eBay. Square has Cash app, which is a peer-to-peer payments app plus they also have in-person small business products for digital payments like their \u201ccash register\u201d called the Square Stand which is useful for freelancing professionals and small businesses.\n\nSo a pro of Square is that it has a far more established presence in the growing sector of digital payments which is mobile POS payments, not E-Commerce. However, E-Commerce is the much larger sector by users alone:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x99o8v39z0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=c12fa73d91b1948acec47fe715cdefe8b4bfb3bb\n\n### As you can see, mobile POS payments are expected to triple in the same time that E-commerce will grow by around\u00a020%.\n\nThis makes a lot of sense to me as E-Commerce still makes up a small amount of all transactions and its trajectory is very much fixed and established now. POS payments are definitely growing though, as on my last trip to India, one of the fastest growing countries, I observed that every small business had a PayTM barcode for transactions, and this is where both Paypal and especially Square will eventually expand to. CNBC also forecasts most digital payment growth will happen in emerging markets (which is why I\u2019ll suggest an ETF at the end which incorporates emerging market companies) \u201cEmerging markets are expected to grow at a rate three times that of developed economies in terms of digital transaction volumes. Digital payments in developing markets grew 21.6 percent between 2014 and 2015, compared to a 6.8 percent rise in mature markets. Non-cash payments in Asian emerging markets are projected to grow by almost a third (30.9 percent), led by powerhouses China and India\u201d. According to CNBC analysts though, cash will still remain supreme for the following reasons: speed of exchange, universal acceptance, anonymity, absence of record and free of charge. Anonymity and absence of record are things that are being fixed by the incorporation of cr(!)ptocurrency into transactions, but it\u2019s likely the biggest reason people don\u2019t switch to cashless is because not all merchants use it and the fees add up especially for many transactions a day for the *merchants*. Eventually when the digital transaction economy grows fully, there will be enough competitors to offer sellers competitive rates to a point where they\u2019ll choose mobile payments for the convenience it provides in terms of not having to use physical cash but as of now only small businesses are willing to make the opportunity cost of losing fees so they don\u2019t have to store cash.\n\n***Paypal***\n\nPaypal is \u201ca global, two-sided network at scale that connects merchants and consumers with 305 million active accounts (consisting of 281 million consumer active accounts and 24 million merchant active accounts) across more than 200 markets. PayPal helps merchants and consumers connect, transact, and complete payments, whether they are online, on a mobile device, in an app, or in person\u201d. They have a variety of new products in development as they have made several acquisitions since their establishment. Paypal offers merchants a technology-agnostic platform that requires no hardware and little time to set up with its Braintree product which is primarily for online sellers and iZettle which is used for POS payments primarily in international markets and they have a user base of 19 million. This acquisition was made with the full intention of competing with Square and since Paypal has had an extremely talented eye for acquisitions in the past in Xoom and Venmo, this [relatively new acquisition](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2018/06/07/why-did-paypal-pay-such-a-high-price-for-izettle/?sh=60f035216860) has a lot of potential, but it could also just be a last minute scramble to catch up to Square\u2019s huge market share in POS payment offerings. Paypal has a great P2P ecosystem in Venmo and Xoom and a credit partnership with Synchrony bank as well which helps diversify revenue streams. Paypal also owns a company called GoPay, which basically provides the same services Paypal does but in China, which expands them into a market that\u2019s more likely to grow in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3vmknzbz0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=23c083f35611ffa86a997cf3a9f75a7c29de7a9f\n\nAs you can see, Paypal has some pretty consistent revenue, profit, and EBITDA growth, but a bit more concerning may be the fact that margins have been relatively stable and they haven\u2019t been increasing at all. I believe the reason for this is because PayPal\u2019s full potential isn\u2019t close to being realized, and even founder Peter Thiel said in his book \u201cZero to One\u201d that Paypal wouldn\u2019t start realizing a majority of their cash flows until 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/78wifzfdz0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bce649ad199031a1c5ddbfbdb663324b7ae3454\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u00a0While Paypal was able to increase earnings per share by a strong 21% from 2018 to 2019, they decreased cash flows from operating activities by 17% from 2018. This requires that we go into the capital expenditures in their CF statement, which will provide a clearer idea of why and how Paypal lost cash flow despite rising net income. Another thing standing out may be the fact that the operating margin is pretty constant, which can be a concerning sign for investors seeking a growth stock. Plus, considering how much the price for PYPL has run up in the past few months you\u2019d expect better profitability to come with it hand-in-hand. But the future being factored into Paypal isn\u2019t based on its face value, or else the price would be very stagnant right now and it wouldn\u2019t have grown nearly as much as it has.\n\nHere\u2019s what I mean:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/47r8msvez0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cefbcab0e52e1a1ca9e42b946f569f4a1595785\n\nThe amount of profit Paypal can squeeze out of its main product is pretty much at a maximum as transaction expenses are growing at the same rate as revenues are and operating expenses are still going up at a somewhat proportional rate to that of net income, meaning that no more value is going to come out of the existing product. While the existing product is still going to grow in popularity, its profitability is only going to decrease or stagnate as Paypal expands into developing markets that aren\u2019t willing to cough up as much in fees. As Thiel himself puts it, that\u2019s \u201chorizontal innovation\u201d AKA just globalism. That alone isn\u2019t enough to justify the investment levels in Paypal, but investments and acquisitions into the future of transactions will expand it, and on top of this it is only recently Paypal has experienced such tremendous growth in cash flows YoY.\n\nNow you\u2019ll see below PYPL\u2019s historic cash flows, and if you go to the bottom you\u2019ll see their free cash flow decreased from 2018 to 2019 as I previously mentioned. The root cause of this is investment purchases, which increased by $5B in 2019 and contributed to the Free Cash Flow decreasing by 800M. Again, if we look at Paypal\u2019s track record when it comes to acquisitions they\u2019ve been very successful, so there\u2019s not much reason to expect much different this time around. If Paypal\u2019s investing, investors are excited. They\u2019ve piled up cash up until last year, and they\u2019re finally using it now based off their cash per share:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rq6x4g8kz0561.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=976d294dbc9ceb68d288570648b9a894fde8c1ac\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jh21m90lz0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=b77b71f08785127aea6cad5afa30e6ff37f78f11\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z2kkuyilz0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dc69e6a4ecd333adf5c3e9fa851a266473fe4ec\n\nAdd to this the tremendous increase in digital payment volume in the past year and we can expect a real change in the entire sector\u2019s trajectory. Hedge funds have been piling up on this supposed legacy company for a valid reason: their time for expansion is ***now, and COVID-19 has only spurred in realizing this perfect storm, as net income and revenue has seen a jump in the past two quarters:***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/v4cgyl1nz0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=272965de645fa1a9aac0ff763863cc28e7942035\n\nSo you must be wondering why Paypal\u2019s cash from operations was down in 2019 from 2018, but in their most recent 10k Paypal explained cash from operations and free cash flow was only down due to \u201cpositive impact of $1.4 billion of changes in loans and interest receivable, held for sale, net following the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio\u201d which was added into the operating income as it was a noncash expense and that\u2019s why 2019 looks down about $1B in cash even though operating income for 2019 was up $0.4B:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7i979ldoz0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=798113837df594aa112574facc98df32685c8c79\n\nPaypal\u2019s newly acquired capital is already being used and it\u2019ll be put to good use based on the meteoric rise in transactions in the past two years. Contactless payments will eventually become a norm and their established e-commerce platform will set them up pretty well on this end.\n\nNow to address the flip side of the coin: POS or Point of Sale transactions, which is a market Square has wrapped around its finger as it\u2019s had the head start since the iPhone 4. Here\u2019s how Square got started, instead of giving 10$ to people for using their product, founder and CEO Jack Dorsey (who also is the founder and CEO of Twitter) gave them the product for free and built an infrastructure around it. It was simply a credit card scanner that could be inserted into the headphone jack of a smartphone. This simple product is still being sent out for free to small businesses and the software and business model that surrounded this tiny card reader has expanded like a wildfire since then. Square would collect 2.75% on each payment similar to Paypal.\n\nSquare also made a \u201ccash management\u201d app, Cash App to dive into a non-retail market.\n\nAbout Cash App: \u201cCash App provides an ecosystem of financial products and services to help individuals manage their money. While Cash App started with the single ability to send and receive money, it now provides an ecosystem of financial services that allows individuals to store, send, receive, spend, and invest their money.\u201d\n\nIt appears as if Square is trying to become an all-round player in the consumer and producer financial ecosystem as Cash App has become more like a bank or brokerage account rather than just a P2P service like Paypal or Zelle. Now, Cash App makes 25% of SQ\u2019s revenues.\n\nIn Square\u2019s 2019 annual report, they reported the following:\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2019, we processed $106.2 billion of Gross Payment Volume (GPV), which was generated by nearly 2.3 billion card payments from 407 million payment cards. At the end of 2019, our Square point of sale ecosystem had over 180 million buyer profiles and approximately 230 million items were listed on Square by sellers.\n\nAs of December 2019, Cash App had approximately 24 million monthly active customers who had at least one cash inflow or outflow during a given month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The above image shows Square\u2019s payment volume distribution across different industries, and as you can see in 2019 payment volume was very diverse which bodes well for SQ\u2019s stability.](https://preview.redd.it/rjjzniarz0561.png?width=371&format=png&auto=webp&s=efe83afdb1c1d8adc38f4c37325fde9c1b125f93)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[This shows the increasing size of sellers who use Square, and this shows that Square\u2019s mission of making small businesses big and having them stick to their product regardless of their stage in growth is working.](https://preview.redd.it/cj0vx6gsz0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7f72e7dad5f7cbe846c489a90be6fa8d81067dd)\n\nAlthough their main business is in processing payments, Square is making itself a fin-tech institutional force with 30 different API\u2019s for retail and e-commerce sellers along with invoicing, appointment, payroll, loyalty/gift card, and account management services. Square also has financing for small businesses in Square Capital, which I find to be the most interesting part of their model. They give small loans to businesses based on the data that they ***already have as Square manages the business\u2019 finances, remember? And this puts them at an advantage to make good debt because of the transparency into the business\u2019 finances. This will allow Square to make extremely profitable and high turnover loans that have virtually NO risk of default***. The types of loans they give are generally small, and they could be as little as $500. They describe these loans as the type you\u2019d ask for from your parents or relatives. Square has such in-depth data from these businesses that when they make loans they don\u2019t even *consider* credit scores: \u201cGenerally, for loans to Square sellers, loan repayment occurs automatically through a fixed percentage of every card transaction a seller takes. Loans are sized to be less than 20% of a seller\u2019s expected annual GPV (their payment volume) and, by simply running their business, sellers repay their loan in eight to nine months on average\u201d\n\nSince 2014, Square has made over $6B in loans with a failure rate of only 4%, which makes sense because Square has access to all of its client\u2019s financials so therefore they possess the ability to make fully transparent loans.\n\nWhen you jump into Square\u2019s financials, there\u2019s a lot of promise to say the least:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4zkobuvz0561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=35c1273cb128c0d627add76e54bb36a9b34941a1\n\nNot only has revenue grown by 42% from 2018 to 2019, net income finally became positive in 2019 and free cash flow increased from 232m to 400m in the same span.\n\nHere\u2019s the revenue breakdown for Square, and as you can observe while transaction revenue saw much stronger compared to Paypal, the real deal was Square\u2019s expansion of its enterprise solutions as those revenues increased by 74% last year, these are revenues recognized as the following: \u201cRevenue from Cash App, Square Capital, and Instant Transfers for sellers currently comprise the majority of our subscription and services-based revenue. Cash App subscription and services-based revenue is primarily comprised of transaction fees from Cash App Instant Deposit and Cash Card. Our other subscription and services-based products include website hosting and domain name registration services, Gift Cards, Square Appointments, Customer Engagement, Employee Management, Payroll, Square Card, and other product offerings.\u201d\n\nB(!)tcoin revenues from Cash App investing whose revenues increased by 210% (in this case B(!)tcoin is an asset that Square owns and sells to those using Cash App to invest in cr(!)ptocurrency.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6krvne7101561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=87bb78977eaa222762e5f24f5061651850ad74e5\n\nAlso in that same span, Square\u2019s cash has nearly doubled. This liquidity will be necessary as Square Capital continues to grow and will require financing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0b3gxlr201561.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=068b3f2d994b04f67fd2ad5c6de629851dd658ae\n\nObserving some long term trends now for $SQ:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Lower SG&A expenses per $ of revenue](https://preview.redd.it/gz1ncgq301561.png?width=398&format=png&auto=webp&s=52195d2a61cfd59582c11349b010a4203c5ca5b9)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Low receivables\\/sales despite expansion of Square capital because revenue has grown so fast](https://preview.redd.it/xa3wpk1501561.png?width=402&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d87e93f2f5a146b7506dbb47cad697b7366adbf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Increasing return on equity \\(higher net profit margins and leverage\\)](https://preview.redd.it/mwzv067601561.png?width=390&format=png&auto=webp&s=d91926c27c23d593e8b951cacc99e32d98babdbc)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Consistently increasing free cash flow points to stability \\(especially since 2019 turned positive\\)](https://preview.redd.it/xzbtkm8701561.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8044e4e5413607ece7c32c4a9e093522ffa9469)\n\nWhile Square is far riskier than Paypal, they seem to be capturing a much larger market and have a bigger vision for the future at this point. Paypal becomes more like Microsoft and Square is kind of like Apple if we went back 10 years. One of them has widespread use and an established platform but still has consistent growth (about 15%) and the other is finding itself in a competitive market but is also slowly establishing absolute dominance. Square is absolutely overvalued, but for a growth stock that\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary, and so is Paypal considering they don\u2019t have nearly as much a prospect for growth unless leadership shows a huge change in direction some time soon.
