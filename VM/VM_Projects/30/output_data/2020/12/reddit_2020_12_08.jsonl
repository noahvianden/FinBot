{"title": "What are your guys thinking on the airlines and cruise industry over the next year?", "selftext": "I bought into both AAL & CCL about 4 months ago. Played my position for a few months and then dumped into them the day before the election. My change was from about 15% combined portfolio weight when I bought in 4 months ago and today I am sitting at about 50% of my portfolio invested in these 2 stocks.\n\nThey are both level with there little peak from about 6 months ago but well off the match highs.\n\nThe way I predict the beginning of the Biden presidency going is a significantly heavier \u201clockdown\u201d then we have seen, for a set period of time. Of course there\u2019s a million different factors and opinions that can go with that prediction but boil down to just the broad sentence for this. \n \nI think a heavier lockdown can only be positive for these industries (more so for the airlines, but the cruise industry I think will follow and could boom). Like I said before I think once Biden takes office in January we are gonna figuratively zip this thing up for the winter. So thinking forward to, let\u2019s say, April, it either worked or it didn\u2019t. \n\nScenario 1: it worked, we nipped it in the bud and heading into the spring we are seeing very low numbers and the vaccine has panned out successfully and is maybe at the phase where all essential workers and at risk populations have access to a vaccine (not really up to date on the vaccine status) \n\nMy prediction: These two industries are pretty much guaranteed to rise back to if not exceed the March highs. If the case load is low and vaccine is on track heading into summer these industries will rise back to March high levels. Heading into fall and winter if we are still seeing very positive signs pandemic wise I can see these industries booming over the winter months. \n\nScenario 2: it kinda worked. The lockdown didn\u2019t really do all that much more then what we have been doing. The vaccine has a lot more impact on this scenario. If it\u2019s cruising ahead of schedule that would be great, if it\u2019s lagging behind not so much. For my prediction let\u2019s say the vaccine is kinda working.\n\nMy prediction: these industries still rise from the current levels. Not quite to the March highs but maybe recover 60-85% of the current gap. The way I see it is: we locked down for 3 months and it\u2019s didn\u2019t really make the impact we thought. So bows the time to test out if lighter restrictions make it worse. Therefore we \u201cunzip the jacket\u201d for the summer which will lead to the rise toward the March highs. If the summer goes well the stocks will continue to rise, if it doesn\u2019t they will drop but still remain above current price.\n\nScenario 3: it doesn\u2019t work and the vaccines a bust. This scenario is probably bad for 99% of the market and everyone of us. However, if this scenario occurs, Which I would say is the least likely of the 3, I don\u2019t think it will be as bad for these industries as it will be for most. The cruise industry could potentially drop well off of where it is right now, but that\u2019s a risk I\u2019m taking. I think the airlines are pretty much bottomed out or at least we saw the bottom a month and a half ago. \n\nAnyways I\u2019ve rambled for long enough.

In order to establish herd immunity using vaccines, minimum requirement must be provided for 60-70% population vaccinated. But, we live in, what's called, the land of freedom, where anyone can refuse to take vaccines for whatever reasons. \n\nSo, we can definitely say that there just is not population around 60-70%, given that even wearing mask was a huge controversy in many parts of the country. I mean it will be somewhere around 20-40% at the most, of all population, which will still help a lot to fight with COVID19, but not enough to call the pandemic a thing of past. \n\nSo what I think will most likely happen is that some population will take vaccines, who are more likely educated (and therefore, have more spending powers) and therefore, will spend a lot of money for travel. \n\nHowever, I think it will depend on travel industry's broad consensus, where they may refuse to accept customers if customers fail to provide proof of successful vaccinations record. Then, it will help them to prevent potential risks and spread while the industry can assure those who are vaccinated that they are more than happy to serve in the cruise ship or airplane. (They are already doing it similarly for mask mandates). \n\nAlso, due to political background, the vaccinated population will be highly skewed. Both shores of the country (CA and NY) will have higher population, perhaps, enough to establish herd immunity while the middle of the continent (WY or SD) will have population vaccinated, perhaps, only among those working in medical field . \n\nSo the takeaway is that when investing stocks for travel industry, it's important to take a look at where the company is based.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46025988459587097}, {"body": "> Not quite to the March highs but maybe recover 60-85% of the current gap\n\nWhere do you get this from?

A company once having paid a dividend can go bankrupt. Through the last 20 years since 2001 growth stocks have outperformed dividend payers. I\u2018m not saying it\u2019s a wrong strategy to invest in dividend stocks but it\u2019s a safer one thus having lower risk-reward.\nThe fact that a payment of dividend doesn\u2019t create any value is shown by the following effect: the date that a company pays the dividend (it\u2019s called ex-div date) the shares of the company drop by exactly the market capitalization it has decided to spend on dividends. So let\u2019s assume Microsoft spends $5bn on dividends, then the same day it gives this money to their investors the stock price drops by the equivalent of those exact $5bn (some 50 cents or so in the stock). So after all paying dividends doesn\u2019t create value, it REDISTRIBUTES. Company\u2018s, whose fields are very competitive or who have a lot of room to grow most of the time are better of to reinvest the money to grow, to stay competitive, to increase their top and bottom line. And maybe, in 15 years, when the company has 10x sales and 15x profits of what it has now it can start to pay a big nice dividend. Basically, paying dividends is a way to show that a company has run out of ideas where to put the money (stock buybacks the other way to put the money somewhere).\n\n(2) the thesis that someone has to be dumber later to pay more for the same share is wrong, because someone will pay more money! Someone WILL buy it higher if the company is worth more. And the company is worth more when their numbers go higher (more revenue, more profits, higher margins). Now you will ask why is that? Well, a growth company like Amazon reinvests the money that in the best case will lead to increasing revenue and profits, thus classical valuation metrics start to go lower (P/E, P/S) and it becomes more attractive to buy the stock because you get more value for your money. You will ask again, why is it a better deal for you to buy a company not paying a dividend but with low metrics, how does a low P/E ratio help me or creates value for myself? Well, let\u2019s take a look at it the other way: Don\u2018t think of yourself who wants a nice dividend each quarter but think of somebody like Warren Buffet or Bill Gates. They have enough money to buy so many shares of a company that they can get control of the entire company (50%+). So in the end buying shares is after all a way to get a fraction of a company that eventually by just accumulating enough shares results in OWNING the company. If a company is cheaply valued (that would be the case if following your thoughts the company grows but the shares don\u2019t go higher) you can buy more and more shares and the big fish could eventually take control of a company by buying shares. Bill Gates and Warren Buffet not necessarily care about dividends or smth like that, they care about whether it\u2019s a good business that will grow and is successful. \nExample: Amazon never paid a dividend. So in your case drastically said you would have considered it a scam when the stock price was at $1. But then someone like Warren Buffet or Bill Gates or anybody else with enough money could take control and own amazon for some $800 millions or so (just an example). But a company like amazon who creates 400bn in revenue this year and billions if profits with all their properties, infrastructure, cloud services etc is worth so so so so so much more ($1.6 Trillion to be exact) that it would be a steal to get it for $1 instead of $3200.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["msft", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Investing in no dividend stocks can also be strategic for tax purposes.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks!", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.017090531066060066}, {"body": "One year later........ please explain", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.013959000818431377}, {"body": "One year later........ please explain", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": -0.013959000818431377}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.45436832308769226}, {"body": "There have been a 1000 posts in this sub asking similar questions (scam, Ponzi scheme, call it what you want), and every time there have been very good points why this is complete nonsense.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.351917564868927}, {"body": "Why would you want a lowly dividend when they could use it to create a more valuable business overall for their stockholders?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What if no one else bought the stock.

{"title": "Board the rocket that is *VXRT*", "selftext": "So here is some DD from myself. Myself being an admitted amateur, but knows how to read patterns and news when I see it. Tired of seeing the word PLTR? Well, in a short couple of months you may get tired of seeing VXRT.\n\n**What is VXRT?**\n\nVaxart, Inc., a clinical-stage biotechnology company, engages in the discovery and development of oral recombinant protein vaccines based on its proprietary oral vaccine platform. The company's product pipeline includes norovirus vaccine, an oral tablet vaccine, which has completed Phase I clinical trials with bivalent oral tablet vaccine for the GI.1 and GII.4 norovirus strains; seasonal influenza vaccine, which is in Phase II clinical trials for treatment of H1 influenza infection; respiratory syncytial virus vaccine; and coronavirus vaccine. It is also developing therapeutic immune-oncology vaccines for cervical cancer and dysplasia caused by human papillomavirus. The company has a research collaboration agreement with Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V. (Janssen) to evaluate the company's proprietary oral vaccine platform for the Janssen universal influenza vaccine program. Vaxart, Inc. is headquartered in South San Francisco, California. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**YTD History**\n\nVXRT was a penny stock coming into the new year and quickly found its feet mid summer rocketing up to 15 per share, 5 dollar short of its 5 YR ATH in 2016. VXRT has been trading relatively sideways for the past couple of weeks and is teetering on being an interplanetary rocket that soars well past the moon. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**My Research and Thoughts**\n\nVXRT will be offering among many other vaccines, and ORAL COVID-19 vaccine. That's right, oral. Now, Why is this huge you might ask? Well for starters the current vaccines are sensitive to specific temperatures and makes transportation ,storage, and administration a large hurdle. With a pill form it can be distributed en mass, globally, in any regular package. This not only relieves staffing issue to administer a vaccine on such a grand scale, but also allows many people that have a huge fear of needles to take it in an oral form. \n\nThe company is getting ready to publish phase 1 trials and finding with word of this happening around December 10. They recently hired a team of 5 manufacturing experts and have quality control expert job openings, which to me signals a need for an all hands on deck operation for when the manufacturing officially starts soon. Vaxart will be the first company to actually bring out mucosal immunity. \n\nThere are grumblings of a **Bill Gates** connection with a new Stanford hire at VXRT. If you dig deep enough, things start to get pretty interesting. Pfizer also recently came out and said that they would have trouble with initial demand for the vaccine and might not have enough till summer of 2021, in turn allowing other major players to enter the market and crush. Joe Biden said it himself, \n\n ***\u201cCost of actually getting the serum into an injection needle into someone\u2019s arm costs a lot of money. It takes a lot of people. It takes a lot of folks to get this done.

{"title": "The Affirm IPO and A New Way to Rip People Off", "selftext": "So I was browsing LULU looking at new joggers (ok fine, I was checking out the guys/girls modeling their shit) and it says $128 OR 4 payments of $32 with Afterpay which made me realize I have seen a lot of \"offers\" like that and wanted to see if it is a money making opportunity.\n\n**TL;DR: Buy Affirm when its IPO goes live. Former PayPal execs are starting microlending and \"buy now, pay later\" companies which could become the modern credit card. Affirm is a large one is going to IPO with a potential $100M offering. The Affirm/Shopify partnership could be like Ebay/Paypal back from the internet stone age**\n\n**EDIT 1: There's no IPO date schedule. Will probably be early next year**\n\nFor the purpose of this DD, we will be looking at Sezzle and Afterpay which are currently publicly traded and Affirm which has recently registered for an IPO (more on that later). All of these companies bill themselves as Fintech companies offering alternative payment platforms and a micro financial lender. Merchants have an incentive to sign up with one of these guys because the payment platform assumes the risk while the business gets advertised on their service. These companies make money by charging merchant fees and interest on missed payments.\n\nStarting with Sezzle cause that is the least interesting, its listed on the upside down market in Australia trading around $5 but is HQ'd in Minnesota and has [estimated revenue](https://growjo.com/company/Sezzle) of \\~30M.  Sezzle reported in February that they had achieved 1M users and now with the pandemic are estimated to be around 1.8M. 6 months ago they brought in [former PayPal executive](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/paul-paradis-promoted-to-company-president-and-veronica-katz-from-paypal-to-take-chief-revenue-officer-role-301090602.html) Veronica Katz as Chief Revenue Officer. Sezzle [advertises](https://sezzle.com/merchants) its business product as \"Engaging the next generation\" and the ability to \"unlock millions of users and increase sales with zero risk\".\n\nNext is AfterPay, an actual Australia based company. They [reported](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/afterpay-announces-full-year-results-301119541.html) their year ending June 30 and revenue topped **$11B with 10M Users and 55.4K merchants.** There are tons of highlights in that report which are worth the scroll. Afterpay has a huge number of customers/products to choose from including the aforementioned LULU and other major retails stores youve heard of. They also have tons of Becky products on there including Shein, Ulta Beauty, Soma, and other places your girl shops at.\n\nThis company, unsurprisingly, is teeming with former PayPal folks. [VP Xin Ge](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xin-ge-b6b258?trk=org-employees_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click) 7 years at paypal, [Dana Stalder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dcstalder/?trk=org-employees_profile-result-card_result-card_full-click) VP back in 04-08 who is now a VC and on the Afterpay board, [Amanda Pires](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amandapires1/) 9 years at Paypal now a VP at afterpay. the company is also littered with former Visa and citigroup folks\n\nAt this point for those still reading you understand what this game is all about, Affirm does the same thing as the other two. We're going to talk about Affirm and its upcoming IPO. Affirm's CEO/founder is [Max Levchin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxlevchin/) who YOU GUESSED IT was an original cofounder of Paypal and was the CTO. Affirm shares unprofitable status like so many other silicon valley companies (PLTR, UBER, etc) but totaled 174M in Q1 2020 revenue. The biggest draw here for Affirm is it's [partnership](https://www.affirm.com/press/releases/affirm-to-power-shopify-shop-pay-installments) with Shopify to use its installment payment platform and gain access to shopify's >200M users. Affirm filed for an IPO to offer 100M in stock with an unannounced IPO date but will probably go in the next few months. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like there is a way to get exposure before IPO (unless you like Morgan Stanley) but the [investors](https://equityzen.com/company/affirm/) in this should tell you how big this company could be. That being said Affirm is seeking to be the credit card of the next generation who have no concept of money but will gladly take the pay for it later method. While they aren't yet profitable, this is a potential billion dollar company with potential buyouts from SQ, big banks, in the future.\n\n**Conclusion: These companies are a hybrid of payment processors, micro lenders, and advertisers that support merchants of all sizes. With the continued explosion of online shopping and the natural human desire to worry about it later, investing in Affirm at IPO could be like getting in the ground floor of PayPal. We know about the PayPal mafia but even the lesser known execs are working on some very forward leaning companies that have huge potential.

Another risk is that Shopify develops their own version of \u201cAffirm.\u201d Like how amazon stolen the toy business from toysrus.

During covid, one of our companies were able to take out a 100k loan from them that was extremely fast and easy (they already have a pattern of our sales data) and they took a 10-15% cut of every sale to go back to loan. This was great for our cashflow as opposed to large amounts being paid once every month. We were able to pay it off in less than 5 months because of this.\n\nThere is also another fraud protection app called signify that we used. They take 1% of every transaction they insure incase there is a chargeback. Guess what, Shopify is now rolling out their own for the platform like this and forced Signify to increase their prices significantly for new applicants.
