{"title": "AMZN 10/16 put sellers therapy group", "selftext": "\nTwo weeks ago I opened twelve 3350-3340 credit put spreads for 2.5, keeping in mind the ER date of 10/23.\n\nMeant to close or roll them out yesterday, missed because I broke a glass on the floor under the desk. Cleaned it fast to get back to it, apparently not well enough as I got a piece stuck in my foot and then the market closed. But I digress... \n\nHad a chance to close them for a decent profit - about 1.6 this morning. But then I saw the SPY block prints, the premarket activity, call:put ratios etc. Of course I ignored the postponing of ER and the negative talk about prime day and GEX. Thought I was smart and concluded this looks like a green day, so why lose out on $160*12, right? \n\n... Wrong. Well it was indeed green, until 11am, I reckon. Then sideways, then hell.\nIt just didn't make sense to me so I kept holding, even though I had another opportunity to close it at 2:55pm, which I skipped due to similar reasoning - seems like it's going up, power hour, pump before market close, hubris.\n\nEventually ended up rolling them out before the final smackdown, when $AMZN was around $3300. Silver lining, I guess.\n\n\n**TL;DR:** So to avoid losing $1000 for each 10/16 3350-3340, I ended up having to pay $140 for the great privilege of owning 10/23 **3500-3490**. Idk what I'm gonna do with it next week if we start with multiple red days in a row. \n\nAt the point in which $AMZN was already at $3300, was there anything I could've done better other than to roll it out to a terrible position like that?\nAny other tips on how to be not stupid?", "id": "jcl820", "created_utc": 1602893245.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 39, "comments": [{"body": "My opinion....\n\nTheta strategies are hard to make quick profits on. The edge is in time decay, and time moves slowly when you want to pull in fast money.\n\nMany times people ramp up the size of the trades in the hopes of more profits. Obviously this can go great if you're right in your 50/50 shot on a directional play. Not so much if you're wrong.\n\nIf you want to trade big you need to close faster when you see those profits. Don't aim for 100% profits or even 50% profits if you're risking 12k. I'd shoot for 25% or less and continue looking for other opportunities.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "What this man said is solid advice. I would listen to him.

Hell maybe same underlying but different strikes. \n\nDONT double up on a winner at 50% thinking you got a sure thing. Got boned on AMD last week doing this and watched some nice profits turn into huge losses. Thankfully my risk management limited the downside, but it still hurt quite a bit. \n\nFar better to lock in profits at 50% and open up a new position and reset your delta and maybe theta. Gamma and tail risk are a bitch. \n\nLastly, cut your losers quickly.

I was almost going to employ same strategy as you (just wider spread/less position size), but after thinking about how crazily AMZN moved around at times, and how it's kinda sitting near the middle of what its price has been for the past bit (3000-3500) - and considering if you have a bull put spread already open, it costs no extra margin to open a bear call on the other side, I decided on condors.\n\n\nI had a 10/16 condor whose put bull side was 31/3200 - closed that shit on *Thursday* - I usually watch each side almost as it's own position, and closed the call side first for about 0.27, then the put side later Thursday for 0.93, so a total buy-back cost of $120. I opened the condor just 3 days before for $11.\n\n\nEven if you pick way OTM call spreads that will only add a fraction of the premium that the put side does to collect (although I've found the opposite to be true lately), at least your bet is no longer directional. \n\n\nMoreover, even if you do start with just a put credit spread - if AMZN has risen a decent amount and your bull put spread has already decreased in value/profited a bit - instead of just hoping things continue along in the right direction to collect more bull put premium, use the opportunity of AMZN being at a higher price than when you opened the put spread, to open a bear call spread same DTE. \n\n\nThis will sort of \"lock in\" your put spread gains to date, since you've now hedged it with a bear call spread that you were able to sell for *more* than had you just opened a condor all at once when you opened the put spread. So the result is an iron condor that you'll effectively have sold for more than it was ever going for at any single point in time in the day.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes time to close them, you can close a side at a time when it's getting close to expiry - I usually just wait for them to be worth about $1 a side or so then buy back.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "This is great advice.

Costco continues to report great quarterly and monthly numbers and the stock is crushing it, and that's good reason to think BJ's will too. This will easily be $50 by year-end, and could go as high as $80. Earnings is November 19, but I'm getting in early in case it catches an upgrade and starts to soar.\n\nMy advice: if it dips into the $39s, buy a little more than you want to hold so you can swing trade back above $41, likely within 48 hours. If you see a 38-handle, mortgage your wife's boyfriend's children and buy calls. $43 is a signal that the rocket is starting, so that's the last stop before moon.\n\nPosition: 1/21 $45c + shares\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BJs](https://preview.redd.it/vr4b498y0pt51.png?width=1985&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef70af223031f6cc7b1a882b3592414efb840d01)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**SNE -** Sony is another company that handily beat expectations last quarter and traded well after earnings, only to be forgotten and left behind by the market's rebound from it's September slump. The chart reminds me of Ebay two weeks ago. Sony reports earnings 10/28, but it has a lot more upside than downside closing out Friday at a 3-month low. I wouldn't be surprised by some nice price-action before the earnings call. Strong retail sales numbers bode well for Sony. I expect another great quarter.\n\nPosition: Nov 20 80c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SNE](https://preview.redd.it/w8gkoea31pt51.png?width=1991&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f069a5b0131b42e52a20c52729accfd5faf8453)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAn update on other recent names [I suggested](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j3fu63/tickers_im_watching/):\n\n**CHWY -** Broke out to the upside. Congrats call holders! I'm mostly in shares now plus some 1/21 $70c\n\n**AAWW -** Set new highs, but I'm less confident in its continued march higher than I was\n\n**UPS -** Underperforming Fedex, but setting higher lows and I think this stock will jump $10 higher sometimes before earnings on 10/28. I'm in Jan 21 $180c and Jun 21 $200c\n\n**BYD -** Boyd Gaming is going to smash estimates when it reports on 10/26, but this is starting to become priced-in. This is my top performer of the week.\n\n**ROKU -** Has exceeded my wildest expectations. I'm currently holding shares because I am getting nervous with how quick it went up. If there's a market crash and it dips 10%, I'd suggest picking up some calls. $300 by mid 2021 would be easy, up from current price of $220.\n\n**OSTK -** I expect +100% or -50% by year end, depending on whether or not sales continue to benefit from COVID for this small-cap retailer. It's traded up slightly over the last two weeks, but remains range bound. There's no shame on FOMO-ing in after earnings on 11/9 if they are good, these shares could triple by the end of next year. I expect some run-up into earnings, but that could be complicated by election jitters.\n\n**CWH -** It beat earnings in August and traded up to $42. Now down around $32. Traders are betting the COVID bump will be temporary. Hint: it's not. I'm expecting another monster quarterly report on 11/5, though election jitters could fuck with me. I'm holding many shares and Dec $35c.\n\n**ECPG -** This debt collector just settled a lawsuit against it by the government for a slap on the wrist, setting it up to crush earnings again on 11/2. It's trading at just 3x annualized earnings from last quarter. A lot of you guys probably already are familiar with this company from its friendly phone calls. With stimmy money running out, I expect this chart is up and to the right.
