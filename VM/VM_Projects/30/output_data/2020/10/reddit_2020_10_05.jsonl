Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 5, 2020**\n\nStocks rose Monday, mostly recovering Friday\u2019s losses, as market participants continue to closely monitor developments around the health of President Trump and additional fiscal stimulus. \n\nLast Friday, Pres. Trump announced that he and the First Lady had contracted COVID-19 and that he was going to Walter Reed Military Medical Center to receive treatment. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley, said Sunday that the President was being treated with steroid dexamethasone (which is typically used in severe cases), remedesivir (broad-spectrum antiviral medication developed by Gilead (GILD)), and  REGN-COV2 (which is used to alleviate symptoms and reduce viral load developed by Regeneron (REGN)). Since then developments around the President\u2019s health have been mostly positive. About an hour or two before market close, Pres. Trump tweeted that he planned to leave the hospital today at 6:30 p.m. ET. \n\nMarket participants also continue to closely eye updates around the election in light of Pres. Trump\u2019s diagnosis and his inability to continue campaigning in the last few weeks before the election on Nov. 3. A new poll released Sunday by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal conducted after last week\u2019s presidential debate, but before news emerged that Trump had tested positive for Covid-19, found that former Vice President Joe Biden was leading Trump 53% to 39% nationally among registered voters in the survey.\n\nHouse Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin have committed to keep working together to try and come to an agreement regarding additional fiscal stimulus after last week\u2019s failed meeting. Today, Pelosi and Mnuchin met once again, for about an hour, but were again unable to come to a consensus. The pair expects to talk again Tuesday as the White House and Democratic leaders try to craft an elusive second pandemic relief package, Pelosi\u2019s spokesman Drew Hammill said in a tweet. While Mnuchin and Pelosi are pushing to come to an agreement, there are still a range of outstanding disagreements between Democrats, Republicans, and White House officials.\n\nEconomists and FOMC officials are once again pushing for the passage of additional stimulus. With millions of Americans out of work and small businesses struggling to stay afloat, economists are worried that a lack of additional fiscal stimulus would completely stunt the already slowing US economy. Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors said, \u201cEconomic scarring is likely to become more apparent in Q4 as more companies finally start to throw in the towel, reporting closures and job cuts. Without additional aid \\[fiscal stimulus\\], the struggles will become more widespread and evident.\u201d\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* Shares in Cineworld Group, which owns Regal Entertainment Group, plummeted nearly 40% in London after the second-largest cinema chain in the U.S. said it was closing all of its locations nationwide, putting in risk an estimated 45,000 jobs, escalating the pandemic-driven crisis facing the entertainment industry and the labor market. \n* Nancy Pelosi issued a public statement to airline executives urging them to, \u201cnot fire people.

They pretty much fought off the entire world and media as everyone prior to 2019 was quick to ridicule Tesla for just about anything. Most of it was unjustified, but still continued because the odds of Tesla succeeding were very low until 2018/2019. Creating a (successful) brand new car company is one of the hardest things to do next to creating a (successful) rocket ship/satellite launch company. And Elon musk was trying to do both at the same time (insanity). So skepticism was definitely understandable. With all that said Tesla has reached a point where they have pretty much \u201cmade it\u201d and can focus primarily on growing as fast as possible rather than survival.

It\u2019s like spending several gruelling years climbing to the top of a mountain only to find someone taking a quick and easily gondola up it on the other side.

{"title": "Finally time to buy $WORK", "selftext": "Slack has been underperforming the market ($WORK 22.5% vs. $QQQ 30% YTD) over the past year. It has also not performed the best in comparison to some of its peers. However, I believe it is now offering a compelling buy opportunity at current prices. This year, due to COVID, many people have not been going into work as much\u2014meaning they need to have another way to communicate. Slack has been there for this. \n\nWith more and more companies realizing that they don\u2019t need to physically bring employees into the workplace, I believe Slack will be used by many to enhance team communication off of the job site for years to come. Unlike competitors like Hangouts, Discord, Floop or Flock\u2014Slack offers a simple interface with employers being able to directly monitor the virtual workspace. Slack also contains a simple integration with many work-related platforms.\n\nWith this, there are two very clear outcomes for Slack:\n\n1. Slack continues to grow and develop on its own, continuing the progress its made over the past couple years. This would result in Slack taking up greater than 50% of the market share of digital work-chat platforms.\n\n2. This is the more likely option IMO. Slack gets bought out by a larger company like $GOOGL, $MSFT, $AMZN, or even $AAPL or $FB. The only question is how much would one of these companies be willing to pay to acquire Slack\n\nNo matter the outcome above, Slack is well positioned to benefit from a WFH environment AND an environment where we return to normalcy. With that said, $WORK is a great buy opportunity at current prices, with a time horizon of 6 months to 3 years.\n\nEdit: The negativity in the comments bodes well for the stock price: bottom.", "id": "j5mm2w", "created_utc": 1601915400.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "Unlike competitors, fails to mention the biggest competitor who ate Slack's pie, M$FT", "score": 23, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5009410977363586}, {"body": "$WORK sucks, I only ever played the runup and sold before ER\u2019s, they literally never went above their direct listing price \ud83e\udd23.", "score": 8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.28586530685424805}, {"body": "It\u2019s also having issues today!
