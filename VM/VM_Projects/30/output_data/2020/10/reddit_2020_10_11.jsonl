Even though in contact payments from SQ is down, they have converted successfully via cashapp to online movements.\n\nLooking at some flow, look at $SQ\u2019s run on Friday:\nhttps://gyazo.com/1eb2621dfb91c6e1e72b6380464e48cf\n\nThis is despite the news of a wavering stimulus. In fact, it looks like option flow is heading that way on [these payment providers](https://twitter.com/unusual_whales/status/1311683758735597569) with big movements happening earlier this month in anticipation of the stimulus.\n\nPaypal and Visa are looking a little beat up in comparison, but I think the flow will hit them too. I suspect Monday/Tuesday we get a lot of talk about the stimulus after the weekend and Trump\u2019s Friday offers. Plus pressure from the populace to make a deal happen.\n\nFor example, Trump may go bigger than a 2.2 trillion COVID stimulus.\n\nAs result, some positions I have: PYPL $202 call 10/30 and SQ $220 call 10/23, and I am bullish on all payment companies as a result.
