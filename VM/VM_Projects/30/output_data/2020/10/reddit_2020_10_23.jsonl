Moving to Schwab already, these are positions that I was holding from before. Not opening new ones.\n\n\\- At any given point in time, I had enough margin/buying power to cover the entire width of the spreads (and more), and the options had high volume and small bid-ask spread - so no liquidity risk.\n\n\\- I know there have been some threads about this in the past but I'm not sure how those incidents ended and the instances in which RH would compensate or fix it in some way. \n\n**What happened:**\n\nHeld 10x AMZN $3200-$3195 put spreads expiring today, 10/23. I was actively watching and managing my positions.\n\nBy actively managing I mean that I placed orders for rolling out to 10/30 at various strikes & for closing, and I was closely monitoring the underlying, the markets, any stimulus talk etc. and adjusting the orders throughout the day to try to make the best from this position. \n\nI meant to hold until market close or couple minutes before \\[at around noon I had to make a go/nogo decision and decided to bet on a climb towards close, based on S&P trending up and AMZN showing strong support and persistently climbing from around $3160.\\]\n\nAll the while I kept adjusting my open orders to balance the risk and so that I don't needlessly roll it out to a poor position like a 3400-3390 10/30 spread when the underlying keeps climbing.\n\nAnyhow, about 20 minutes before close, I decided to tweak the order I placed for 6 of the 10 spreads so I canceled the live order and quickly tried to place the replacement, only to get a notification that they were closed. Enter Robinhood \"risk check\". In the 2 seconds gap, before I replaced the order, their automated system picked those spreads and reaped them. It closed all 6 spreads for (limit) $500 each. Then, AMZN closed at $3205.\n\nI'm truly baffled: 1) they placed a limit order for the max loss; they could've done that a minute before market close, considering the volume. 2) they could've detected that I'm actively trading these positions and delayed their actions. 3) they could've let these options expire and if they do so ITM - facilitate the exercise, buying and selling of the underlying; the max loss would've been the same.\n\n**Bottom line:** I'm down $2800 (well, a bit less if I would've closed them myself right before market close). I don't see how it's justified to auto-close when I had active orders (essentially interfering with my trading in real time) and plenty of time before market close. I'm unable to reach RH by phone and their email rep is not helpful. \n\nPlease, please help me make sense of this. Would it be possible to get any sort of compensation or reinstate the position retroactively?\n\nI've had a broker (not RH) sell an option for me without asking in the past, and after explaining the situation to them and why it didn't make sense they somehow were able to cancel the order retroactively, so my account suddenly held the same position, as if the order to sell & close the contract was never placed.\n\nAny help would be much appreciated.", "id": "jgxn61", "created_utc": 1603493245.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.55, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": ">Please, please help me make sense of this.

{"title": "OSTK and GME. A quick story about my first experience in the market and why I'm buying GME:", "selftext": "As my first post, I want to be transparent that I'm more interested in meeting other traders who wish to do this professionally. I'm more interested in feedback. \n\nMy first year of trading, I did not buy or sell anything. No stocks no options. I organized a watchlist of companies I loved and followed religiously while saving ~$400. Then OSTK happened.\n\nPatrick Byrne, then CEO of overstock.com, sold a ton of his own assets and consequently tanked OSTK share price. Yadayadayada fuck it. It dipped, I made my first move, I made money on the correction yadadada and then shit got weird. Like, CEO dumping his own company, Russian spy scandal, SEC stopping trading for the day!, short squeeze, class action lawsuit weird. (Newbies, look it up)\n\nBut with my hymen busted and a fresh, bewildered look at the dirty dirty beautiful world of finance I learned what a short squeeze is. \n\nGME is a short squeeze that hasn't happened yet. DD in the paragraph after next.\n\n... Some of you trade options successfully and long term. I'm struggling with the books and YouTube videos I have in regard to options trading. I can tell you I need help. I average 70% overall and 186% YTD with stocks. But it's not enough and I need help with options. It's not a secret that this sub has turned to new traders (God bless them). \n\nGME is a short squeeze that hasn't happened yet. A short squeeze is when a stock rockets up. It's like cranking the throttle on a new bike or pinning the pedal on your Alfa Romeo (DM me if you have a Ferrari). A short squeeze is when you look at your charts and can't make sense of how much money you've made.\n\n\ud83d\ude44 A short squeeze is when a stock sells so much that the price goes up. Shares sold short (on margin) get pressure from the broker to be pushed up. For instance, GME had 89% short interest a month ago. Now it's OVER 100% short interest. To be honest, I didn't know this was possible before the beer virus but hey- anything goes right? One more time, I'll try to explain:\n\nThere are about 65 million shares of GameStop. 68 million are sold short right now. The price has been going up. Big investors have come in. Sony and Microsoft have cut deals with GameStop.\n\n....\n\nfuck it. I'm tired. As your wife's boyfriend, I want to tell you very much that I love you and I wish the best.
