{"title": "$ILMN DD", "selftext": "Tl;dr Illumina is really profitable for a growth stock and its technology will be industry leading when a serious health-tech revolution happens\n\nIllumina is best known for making equipment and software for next generation sequencing, genotyping, and gene expression. Genetic sequencing is simply acquiring the specific sequence of base pairs in a strand of DNA, and this sequence can be analyzed through genotype analysis to extract a variety of information such as diagnosing variants of cancer and study rare variants through finding differences between normal DNA and mutated DNA. Genome sequencing was used during the ebola outbreak to monitor live mutations in the virus\u2019s DNA. Characterizing genetic variation and using our biological differences as strengths against pathogens and other life-threatening ailments is obviously a very important sector to understand as it has directly to do with the wellbeing of people (mostly developed countries with the means to afford access to such technology). Illumina\u2019s innovation in this field will not only make genetic sequencing more affordable, it\u2019ll make it a widespread solution for all sorts of individual genome related problems. Illumina in 2014 had reduced the cost of sequencing a human genome to $1,000, down from a price of $1 million in 2007. Not only that, but Illumina\u2019s products make their way into the agricultural sector, where it helps agrigenomics, which is the use of genome analysis in crops and livestock. According to Illumina, \u201cResearchers can identify natural and novel genomic variation and deploy genome-wide marker-based applications to accelerate breeding and production of healthier and higher-yielding crops and livestock\u201d. Beyond accelerating artificial selection of desirable crops, genome sequencing also helps with the improvement of GMO crops. Genome sequencing helps scientists link certain genetic sequences with a positive phenotype (phenotypes are the observable characteristics caused by certain genes). For example, if scientists use Illumina\u2019s genome sequencing technology and find that in all rot-resistant tomatoes, there is a common genetic sequence, they can use gene editing technology to insert these genes in all the tomatoes or use the aforementioned marker-based applications to make it easier to selectively breed the rot-resistant tomatoes. Outside of these consumer markets Illumina has a lot of penetration in clinical genomics as well, especially in the previously discussed issue of cancer detection and analysis. For cancer genomics, Illumina\u2019s goal is to \u201cidentify genomic changes that transform a normal cell into a cancerous one. Understanding these genomic changes will improve diagnostic accuracy, increase understanding of the prognosis, and enable oncologists to target therapies to individuals\u201d. Illumina has also acquired GRAIL, a company that can target early onset cancers using blood by capturing cfNA in the bloodstream. Gene editing in crops for agriculture, however, isn\u2019t the only use of gene editing. New gene editing technology called CRISPR is \u201ca powerful technology that allows scientists to quickly target, delete and repair any mutated sequence of DNA in any gene\u201d [according to Stanford Medicine](https://stanmed.stanford.edu/2018winter/CRISPR-for-gene-editing-is-revolutionary-but-it-comes-with-risks.html). This new CRISPR technology is being tested for human health care as [reported by Time](https://time.com/5642755/crispr-gene-editing-humans/). The human genome was first reliably and precisely spliced with CRISPR 7 years ago, and these recent trials are promising as human gene editing has the potential to fix \u201cgenetic diseases ranging from sickle cell anemia to certain types of cancer and even blindness.\u201d With the human health industry being such a large industry worth trillions of dollars, the ability to cure genetic diseases will be revolutionary and in high demand. Since every human is genetically unique, the health industry will need a large supply of genome sequencing technology, and Illumina\u2019s sequencing technology, which reduced the cost of sequencing a human genome to $1,000, down from a price of $1 million in 2007, will be the best option. Of course, the premise for this increased demand in the future (due to the development of gene editing in humans) is just speculation based on current human trials, but based on what is being seen, and the possibilities for this technology, it is likely that it will be adopted, generating another huge market for Illumina\u2019s technology.\n\nIn terms of where their revenue comes from, 2/3 of it is from consumables and the rest is from services and instruments. Consumables are the sequencing kits themselves, which are much heavier in sales volume than the instruments which are far more expensive and not as many are needed for labs. The totality of sequencing services, instruments, and consumables Illumina provides makes up 87% of their total revenue. According to Illumina it\u2019s because of their innovation that sequencing has been made more accessible: \u201cSince we launched our first sequencing system in 2007, our systems have reduced the cost of sequencing by a factor of more than 10,000. In addition, the sequencing time per Gb has dropped by a factor of approximately 12,000\u201d, which is an astronomical reduction in cost and hopefully at some point we can get to a stage where any individual can afford genome sequencing services. Illumina has tremendous integration in this business space as they provide a cloud analytics software to accompany instruments and sequencing kits. The BaseSpace Information Suite \u201cintegrates directly with our sequencing instruments, allowing customers to manage their biological sample and sequencing runs, process and analyze the raw genomic data, and derive meaningful results.\u201d\n\nNot only this, but their software \u201cfacilitates data sharing, provides data-storage solutions and streamlines analysis through a growing number of applications developed by us and the bioinformatics community\u201d. Being able to create a scalable solution for genomic analysis is just one of the many things that has given Illumina so much pricing power in this space. Arrays are where the other 11% of Illumina\u2019s revenues come from and this is the technology that is used in consumer genomics. This technology has a chance to expand when genetic analysis becomes more of a luxury rather than just something for a medical industry. Arrays are used to measure gene expression. Illumina is expecting to continue to improve these systems, which is indicated by their desire to increment R&D spending once again as they reported the following their most recent annual filing: \u201cResearch and development expense in 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $647 million, $623 million, and $546 million, respectively. We expect research and development expense to increase during 2020 to support business growth and continuing expansion in research and product-development efforts\u201d. This means the company does not yet have a fully developed competitive advantage, and that means it\u2019s still at risk of being overtaken by a competitor which makes it a growth stock/speculative. Usually though, you\u2019re far better off buying before the advantage is developed (at which point the company will taper off) which is why the growth stage tends to offer the best returns. Illumina also doesn\u2019t plan on paying dividends any time soon, but Illumina does conduct stock buybacks which improves return on equity and return on assets as cash is offloaded and the total amount of equity available to the public decreases.\n\nRegarding Illumina\u2019s finances, the company is relatively healthy. The debt/equity ratio is 0.25 which may lower returns due to lower leverage but also it makes it far more recession resistant. EPS is forecasted to grow by 56% next year, and Illumina\u2019s great margins will be what allows for that:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mb9lofgxl2v51.png?width=226&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c3d068158ec95407dd4a82306458369cd8b32df\n\nBut as you can see, the gap for operating expenses is pretty big and net cash inflows from operations have decreased from 2018\u20132019 as R&D expenses and investment outflows due to GRAIL shot up (see bottom line for net cash from operations):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5vc80kyzl2v51.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=871f583ac3435304719004113e8fc8d2590a531e\n\nWhile consolidated net income has increased drastically YoY, the expenses and investment outflows have consistently weighed down cash flows, and this is partly due to the GRAIL acquisition, which brought the stock price down from 400 to nearly 283 (where I first saw the best position to enter) and since then it has rebounded back to the 315 range. The thing is, now the investments are generating positive cash flows for Illumina. Although operating cash flow has flattened out, cash flow from investments has finally turned positive, which shows that while operations may not be consistent yet, they will consolidate more in the future as investment cash flow starts becoming positive. The long term implications for this strategy suggests that management has less of a cost-cutting and cash scraping mentality but rather that they tend to go for growth. They believe in their products so they continue to reinvest cash and spend more on R&D as the future prospect for their product grows, especially during a pandemic which selectively targets certain **partially gene-based traits** such as diabetes/heart disease vulnerable populations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ihf4i1p2m2v51.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=6464b6f8f3218adba5d10da6faf5ee269184efab\n\nThe best news one could take away from the recent annual report is that Illumina has begun to pay down debt as financial cash flows were heavily reduced in 2019:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52fqd5n4m2v51.png?width=603&format=png&auto=webp&s=2944328f5f573baa658467bf8f545d0f9598bc05\n\nIf financing cash flow was negative, it means Illumina paid back more in debt than it took in and conducted stock buybacks, which shows that it\u2019s consolidating itself more in the conservative healthcare sector. Due to the net decrease in financing cash flows, net cash and cash equivalents were counted as an **increase** and cash from the beginning to the end of the year increased from 1.14B to 2.04B. As you can see, common stock repurchases also increased by over 50% in 2019 from 201M in 2018 to 324B most recently.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tg04w86m2v51.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=28ac46c57bdbe42b1be08898e02d72b57b6b0561\n\nAnd now for a quick time series summary of financials:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[consistently rising gross profit](https://preview.redd.it/3q6on4k8m2v51.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d6dc81dc2531e405b25b9a0decdeac743038968)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Decrease in interest rate spending per $ of gross profit](https://preview.redd.it/5wuarfq9m2v51.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=6097c8b59f3bcaea261c1b7dfe1a490c1f17866f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Despite increased R&D spending, as a &#37; of gross profit it has declined due to the massive increase in profits.](https://preview.redd.it/u3ijkiecm2v51.png?width=435&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c1adaaeb4129f384653023d2d5beb813d495b91)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[EBITDA margin has increased since 2019 due to positive investment cash flow, lower debt](https://preview.redd.it/04omgu5em2v51.png?width=411&format=png&auto=webp&s=a322f7cb31f4c87bee7346b8b244c2ea91cec42a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Historically increasing operating cash flows](https://preview.redd.it/u0gpnfnfm2v51.png?width=436&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5787776ff5a428bae92c66c15c033934cf49fc6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Better debt coverage now](https://preview.redd.it/ms6c3x7im2v51.png?width=407&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed07280a0804f6b19b96719a931c1e28e3723a8f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[P\\/E Ratio decreased slightly even though earnings shot up](https://preview.redd.it/lxw16xvjm2v51.png?width=389&format=png&auto=webp&s=f239a241e493df5c5cd809e7ea24f927f61e2000)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[More cash means more liquidity and long-term security](https://preview.redd.it/4thb6r0mm2v51.png?width=507&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea2074f7945174413f55e9511ef720447087ebbc)\n\nBottom line: Despite selling a relatively new and innovative product, Illumina maintains steady financials and exponential growth. Setting out to revolutionize healthcare is no easy feat, but with financials like these and the pricing power they have on genetic sequencing makes them the biggest competitor in this space. Illumina has nearly half of its customers outside of the US making its consumer base very well diversified. It doesn\u2019t have too much of its revenue come from just one customer either, so this is another sign of a stable and growth-oriented company. However, it may be a bit too late for investors to see immediate gains, so I\u2019d start with a small position and continue to average down rather than go in for the short term.\n\nRegardless of your cost, Illumina\u2019s technology is set up to make it a huge gainer in the future.\n\nPositions: Shares LOL", "id": "jhc33x", "created_utc": 1603557744.0, "score": 62, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "I like your funny charts magic man", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks I found them on googlee", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21476182341575623}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04308310151100159}, {"body": "You have python charts, I'm in.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "Basically a quant genius", "score": 13, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19267591834068298}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09383951872587204}, {"body": "To many squiggly lines, I'm out", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": ":(", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Don't be sad.
