But there are rarely stocks under $10 that could be easily analysed as a good value stock, thus preventing smaller account from running the strategy properly.\n\nIn seeing this, I would like to create a discussion on selling wide put credit spread as a replacement of a cash secured put.\n\nThe idea is to lower the capital needed UP FRONT ( thx [PapaCharlie9](https://www.reddit.com/user/PapaCharlie9/) for correcting my strategy claim. It lowers the capital needed to open position, but the maximum capital needed if the stock gets assigned is still the same.) using a put credit spread, but the width of the strike should be large enough so that it simulates the return and probability of profit of a naked put.\n\n**Case Study:**\n\nSymbol XLF\n\ncurrent stock price: 24.34\n\nDTE: 42 (expires on 18/9)\n\nto sell naked put at the \\~30 delta, it requires 2.3k cash to have a $0.44 premium at the $23 put.\n\nThe management:\n\nWhenever 50% of profit target is attained, the position is closed and re-established. If the position is contested and a lost of 100% of the credit is registered, the position is rolled with a credit to a later month. If neither of these are achieved, let it expire or assign the stock. Then repeat like original the wheel.\n\nA very crude estimate of the profit is that the premium is collected as $0.44 with a hold to expiration probability of profit 74.93%\\~75% (Number is from thinkorswim). Say the losers are taken at the 100%. Then the expected return is:\n\n0.44\\*50%\\*75%-0.44\\*100%\\*25%= $0.055 per share. That is, the expected return is crudely $5.5 per contract. (Note that the rough estimate assumed the probability did not change after invoking exit strategies. This is a wrong assumption. But the correct numbers are not known prior. But it has always been believed that these strategy increases the probability. Tastytrade usually claims that there are 80% probability of profit in these trades, then the corresponding return would be $8.8 per contract.)\n\nSince for smaller accounts like 10k account 2.3k is already 23% of the account, violating the rule of trade small trade frequent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***The energetic wheel:*** *(Hope that I am the first one making this strategy up and got to name the strategy)*\n\nIn seeing this, I propose that one could invoke a wide credit spread instead of a naked put.\n\nwe could have a put credit spread at $23/$18 and collect $0.41 of premium. As one can see, the premium decreased by 7% and the probability of profit (assuming going to expiration) is decreased from 74.93% to 74.61%. Such decrease of probability of profit is ignored.\n\nThe open interest for XLF at 18 is around 20k, therefore should be liquid enough for easy open and close.\n\nThe management would be the same as before. An assumption is that I would ignore the stock breaking through the $18 strike. If this strike is broken, I don't think there will be anyone who would be holding this stock anyway, notice that even the march sell off only forces the stock to go to around $17.5, I could safely assume that in most cases the credit spread is managed similarly as the naked put. (I am aware of the tail risk of breaking $18, but such correction would be smaller than my assumptions made in probability of profit, it has diminishing return to account for that.)\n\n(Remember that this analysis of not getting through the strike 18 should be done case by case with different stock. You are not going to trade the energetic wheel using a 5 point wide strike credit spread for say TSLA. A good start is to check the delta of your long strike for being small enough.)\n\nThe crude estimate of profit is then:\n\n0.41\\*50%\\*75%-0.41\\*100%\\*25%= $0.05125 per share or 5.125 per contract.\n\nHence, one is sacrificing around 7% in the total profit in exchange to trade more expensive stocks and hence a more reliable companies or ETFs. (Here I meant that the cost you pay up front is less, so your entry would need less cash.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote that this strategy should yield $5.125/$500= 1.025% per cycle. (In a tastytrade claimed probability, it would be around $8/$500= 1.6%). Usually we believe that each cycle is around 1 month long, therefore, the yearly return would be 12.3% (in tasty trade claimed probability, it is 19.2%).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne more assumption is that the premium is calculated at the current market environment which the IV percentile is above average, so the expected return would be higher in a higher IV environment and lower is lower IV environment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Note: This is a strategy discussion, by no means it is a financial advice and I am not responsible for any loss if one applied the strategy.***", "id": "i5hkp9", "created_utc": 1596819792.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "Hey you!
