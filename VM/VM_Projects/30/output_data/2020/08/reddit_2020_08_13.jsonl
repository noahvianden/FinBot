{"title": "Why AAPL stock split may make it go down for a bit, and drop the Dow", "selftext": "For those who do not know, the DJIA is weighted by share price, not market cap. So, when AAPL splits, the value of the DJIA will drop, all things being equal.  \n\nThis means that funds and ETFs which track the dow will need to sell three of the four \"new\" AAPL shares to match the Dow returns. They can't hold those shares, so they will need to dump them. \n\nIt's possible the buy side will offset the decline in share price, but I think this is the first major split we have seen of a DJIA stock in a while. \n\nThe Dow is a stupid index, because the apple split will immediately drop it by a few hundred points just because of how the Dow is weighted.\n\nEdit: I guess it won't drop the Dow by a few hundred points, they will update the divisor, but funds holding large amounts seeking to track the DJIA will still need offload some shares, but maybe not 3 of the 4.\n\nEdit 2: does anyone know how these funds dump shares without being super disruptive?

{"title": "China and the US dollar", "selftext": "Because the USD is the worlds reserve currency, it puts the US in a better position. Everyone wants USD, so J Pow can print trillions without causing inflation. The US can essentially create for free a product that everyone wants. Not bad.\n\nChina is currently the world's largest commodity importer. How do they pay? You guessed it, USD. Looking at only oil, China imports 11 million barrels of crude per day. At $US40/barrel, that's $440mm/day on oil alone. If oil climbed to $90/barrel, they would be spending $US1billion/day on oil. It's kind of strange that the worlds largest commodity imported pays in a 3rd country currency, and this mainly happened because Chinese commodity imports grew too fast for a new corresponding financial system to keep up. So they use dollars.\n\nPolitically, China and America don't get along and it is becoming pretty clear that they both feel the world is not big enough for the both of them. One of the only bipartisan issues in Washington is anti-china sentiment. Idk much about politics in China, but I think it's fair to say that it's not pro-america.\n\nChina definitely doesn't want to rely on US monetary policy/US banks, which could be used to destroy their economy, to import commodities. They want another option, which brings us to a few possible scenarios.\n\n1. China continues to rely on the US dollar. Relations normalize and the show goes on in basically the same way. This seems to be the option that is being priced into markets. This scenario is mildly bullish.\n2. The US moves to cut China out of the US dollar system. Chinese growth plummets, commodity prices implode, and the entire world enters a devastating deflationary depression. I think this is unlikely. This is the economic equivalent of mutually assured destruction. This scenario is bearish everything. Long volatility I guess?\n3. China links the Renminbi to gold and begins paying for their commodities with Renminbi. This would actually make sense, because a lot of commodity producing countries buy consumer/industrial products from China already so the Renminbi would have value in international trade. This scenario is bullish for gold. Bearish dollars.\n4. China convinces commodity producers to accept Renminbi as payment without linking Renminbi to anything. Xi has probably not read Art of the Deal so I doubt he could pull this off, but it is possible I guess. In this scenario, China would likely try to convince commodity producers to buy high-yielding Chinese bonds with their Renminbi. This scenario is very bullish Chinese bonds.\n\nI think that right now markets are assuming option 1, which seems unlikely to me. Politics in both countries is making option 1 look impossible. I think option 3 is the most likely. According to official numbers, I don't think that they have enough gold to convince anyone that they could reliably exchange Renminbi for gold, but maybe they have more than the official amount?
