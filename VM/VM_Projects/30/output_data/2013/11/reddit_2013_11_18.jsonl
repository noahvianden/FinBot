TSLA has to do this in order to be a successful growth stock.  First time you dont you will get an even worse correction as folks flee for the finish line.  TSLA then tempers next quarter's expectations causing a much smaller controlled correction and hopefully ensuring they beat future expectations.\n\nAnother fire makes the press and TSLA is again able to turn it into PR gold by using the owner's words.  \n\nI think they are making the right moves.  More over I think they have a special product that holds up to every test so far. They started with the luxury car and now are working on the infrastructure.  I am curious as to where this stock will be once they release the next model.  Even if energy gets cheaper I don't think it will matter when you consider a car that does not pollute.  Gas will never get under 2$ a gallon as it takes too much money just to make, market and distribute. \n\nIf they are able to speed up the charging process (which I think they will) this will continue to push them ahead at an even greater velocity.\n\nThis stock is a long term hold but don't forget to take profits when it makes sense.  I bought at 89, sold half at 180 and bought that half again at 137.  I think anytime you can get in at under 150 you are getting in cheaply.  (I took the profit I made from the 180$ sale and bought some SCTY).  I am not sure if I will sell again until it is over 200.\n\nThis is all free off the cuff opinion so consider the source before making your own opinion.\n", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I 100% agree.

If they execute step 3 of their plan (High volume low priced car) successfully, in ten years time Tesla may well be worth 5x what it is today and displace one of the big three domestically.  \n\nIn my opinion, I think they are a solid long purchase.  Right now its extremely volatile and quick profit buys are hard to rationalize, but long term I believe pretty strongly that Tesla is going to succeed.  Elon isn't just a visionary entrepreneur, hes also proven to be pretty stellar at building companies and his track record speaks for itself.  Also, the Model S is just stellar.  You can argue about the stock technicalities, but at the end of the day Tesla did build what I believe is the best car the world has ever seen.
