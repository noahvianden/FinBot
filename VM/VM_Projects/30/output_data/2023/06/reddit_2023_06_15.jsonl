This growth is driven by the demand for generative AI in consumer companies and cloud service providers. The magnitude of the revenue increase was not surprising, but the hype around generative AI was unexpected.\r  \n\r  \nTechnical Trend: The demand for Nvidia's data center segment, specifically for Ampere and Hopper products, is expected to continue growing at a double-digit rate. The growth rate depends on the capacity to produce chips. The company predicts an incremental $2.5 billion in revenue for the next quarter, primarily from making more chips for H100, A100, and L40.\r  \n\r  \nCompetition and Bottlenecks: The sustainability of data center demand is still a concern, but there are at least a couple more quarters of high demand expected. The market is currently focused on building as many chips as possible. However, the market will eventually shift towards more specialized models and smaller, more accurate models. Open-source models like Llama and Stable Diffusion are expected to take specific workloads and applications away from large language models like GPT.\r  \n\r  \nVolatility and Stability: The market for AI is highly volatile due to the rapid pace of innovation. The capabilities of AI systems, such as image generation, are improving exponentially, but there is still room for further innovation. The market is expected to stabilize as certain applications become solved problems and specialized models become more accurate and efficient. However, the pace of innovation in AI is currently high, and stability is not expected in the near future.\r  \n\r  \nCUDA and Software Moat: Nvidia's CUDA implementation gives the company an advantage in the software stack. While other companies like AMD are making progress with alternatives like ROCm and HIP, Nvidia's CUDA ecosystem is well-established. However, the software moat could be breached in the next 2-3 years as competitors catch up and port their software to alternative platforms.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amd", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "It\u2019s time.
