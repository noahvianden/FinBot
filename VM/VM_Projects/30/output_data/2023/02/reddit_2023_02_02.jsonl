Economies face inflation risks when the demand for goods and services increase rapidly while supply isn't able to catch up.\n\nTo understand the cause of inflation you need to think about the primary drivers of demand and the bottlenecks of supply in the economy.\n\nIn the 70s the US economy was much more manufacturing focused than it is today. Energy and commodities were a larger cost input to the economy and when these inputs rose companies had to push costs on to consumers. The 70s was also interesting in that it was the decade the baby boomers entered the labour market on mass and started earning.\n\nAs baby boomers started earning they wanted to buy houses, cars and other things which cost large amounts of energy to run and produce. During this period US oil consumption rose rapidly, almost doubling over the decade.\n\nThe problem with oil is that it's not something you can just quickly start producing more of. If you have a shortage, you either have to wait years for supply to catch up or you need to reduce demand. But not only was there a shortage, as I mentioned previously demand for oil during this period just kept rising as the workforce boomed.\n\nThe 70s experienced high inflation because they were hit hard both by rapidly increasing demand and coupled with long-term supply bottlenecks. Neither of which were easily fixable. In fact the market largely fixed the problem over the course of a couple of decades, not by increasing supply, but by focusing on improved energy efficiency and investment in alternative sources of energy.\n\nFast forward to today and oil demand in the US has been flat for decades. Further the US economy isn't as dependant on oil prices like it was in the 70s and is also now a net-exporter of oil. While higher oil prices will have an impact, that impact will be far more muted than in the 70s.\n\nThe US also doesn't have a rapidly growing working population today. In fact it has the exact opposite problem with the boomers now exiting the workforce on mass.\n\nOkay - so what is causing the inflation? Well, in 2020 the whole world went nuts because of this Covid thing and politicians decided to shut down the entire global economy. During this period the supply of global goods dropped rapidly. In a normal recessionary environment this would be fine though because everyone would be losing their jobs and have no money to spend  on goods anyway, but this was no ordinary recession. This time the US pumped trillions of dollars into the economy to prop up demand.\n\nThe result was a massive spike in inflation which is still working it's way through the global economy 3 years on. As I write this consumers are still spending down savings accumulated during Covid. What we saw over the last few years was unprecedented for a recessionary environment, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT\n\nIn addition to this a significant percentage of the workforce decide not to return to work. Originally this would reduce demand and lower inflation but unlike what normally happens where people retire and check out of the work force because of old age, these people were quitting because they had so much money. This has resulted in a labour shortage which is now pushing up wages.\n\nHowever unlike the 70s long-term there is practically nothing to keep the inflation we're seeing today high imo. Demand for oil in the US will continue to decline as population ages and energy production shifts to more sustainable sources. I'm of the view that tight labour markets don't cause sustained inflation because it's fundamentally a self-correcting problem - as labour has more bargaining power, corporate margins drop reducing demand for labour. Powel probably is correct that labour markets are too tight, but this isn't likely to be a long-term problem imo. And in theory, less workers should reduce economic demand over longer periods while automation and other advancements should continue to increase the affordability and supply of all goods and services. Japan is a good example of an economy which has a declining workforce, yet has the opposite of an inflation problem.\n\nJust my take.

I think at best the Philips curve probably has some predictive ability over near-term wage inflation, but the rest is far too complicated for such a simple model to be reliable.\n\nI kinda touched on this in my previous comment, but just think about it for a second - if a company suddenly has to pay it's employees 5% more then what are the knock-on effects of that extra expense? If I increase the cost of your bills by 5% are you going to consume as much? The same applies to companies, it's just they cut down on things like ad spend, fancy offices, and perhaps even their expansion plans. All of this has a deflationary effect elsewhere in the economy, with a slight lag.\n\nIf I had to guess I think what could be happening is that companies are cutting back where they can but a lot of companies are still short of workers. I think this is why you're seeing a lot of tech companies talk about a slow down in things like ad spend and cloud spend, but companies are still hiring where jobs need to be done.\n\nBut eventually it's going to get harder for companies to continuing cutting costs elsewhere and they'll either have to slowdown hiring or take a hit to profit margins. Additionally, the impact of that slow down on non-essential spend will probably weigh on growth in the broader economy over time.\n\nBut I am surprised by it and I think eventually unemployment has to rise because supply / demand imbalances simply can't persist over an extended period of time. Either the supply of workers has to increase (which isn't going to happen) or demand for labour has to be destroyed via higher wages and a slowing economy.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation", "recession"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Nobody knows.\n\n**One major difference is the energy landscape.

There were a smattering of other small producing countries, but almost all of it was the US and the Saudi's.\n\nToday lots of other countries have meaningful oil output, and the oil industry itself is globalized. Not local, not regional. Global.\n\nMore participants with real capacity, in addition to the capacity to ramp up - which matters a lot - means individual actors or combinations like OPEC are simply less of a threat.\n\nFracking has splintered the market further. Solar, wind, and the talk of newer, safer, even portable nuclear energy are taking some pressure off as well. Other developed and developing countries have enormous oil reserves (Brazil, Venezuela, Norway, etc.)\n\nEnergy is the most basic commodity, save for food & water. When energy gets expensive, everything else gets more expensive, and fast. When it gets cheap, everything else gets cheaper.\n\nWe had front row seats for this in 2021 when Russia invaded Ukraine and threw oil markets for a loop. You may have noticed it didn't persist. The west put a cap on oil prices to punish Russia and what did Russia do? Whine and cry a while. Then it sold oil to India and China at much worse rates that it was used to getting.\n\nThe last thing Saudi Arabia wants is to create another great oil & gas land rush. The US, Europe, Japan, etc. (the west) has lots of goods and services they can sell, many of which no competitor can replicate well.

The principal remains the same, however. People living at the subsistence level who are not moving up will choose the path of least resistance to maintain a subsistence level.\n\n* Silent Generation: 42M\n* Me Generation: 76M (Boomers)\n* X Generation: 55M\n* Millennial Generation: 62M\n\nSee the pattern? Each boomer supported roughly half (0.55) of a silent generation retiree. Each X Gen is supporting almost 1.4 boomers.\n\nIt will work through and get a little better as the boomers die and Millennials gain experience, but there's going to be a constrictive pain point for quite a while yet.\n\nIntelligent immigration reform could solve this almost over night - there are millions of miserable souls willing to do difficult jobs for low pay just for the opportunity to live here. ***Immigration conflicts with the interests of the subsistence worker*** who already has US citizenship, residency, or other stable working arrangements.\n\nYou won't notice too many white collar workers worrying about immigration, because for people with any differentiating skill (known as *franchise*), the immigrant is a boon - not a threat. They're willing to do hard jobs, work long hours, accept low pay, and they still contribute to economic demand. Immigrants need to eat. They need a roof. Their kids need schools and clothes. They still need doctors and accountants. They buy cars, couches, and televisions.\n\nTo anyone who is not subsisting at the minimum effort, the immigrant is a huge boon. It's only the subsistence worker and those in politics/religion who pander to them that find reason to hate immigrants.\n\nInflation takes time to filter down, but it pushes up the minimum subsistence wage.

As was recently the news in China and India (Evergrande housing ponzi scheme bursting, Adani's Indian debt empire collapsing), you can see this is not simply a \"US\" or western problem. Interest rates around the world are always jockeying for position. Every countries \"bond offering\" affects every other country, and when big economies like the US or Japan keep rates low, other countries offering significantly higher benchmark rates end up flooded with money.

{"title": "Option Buyers in AMZN - This is for you (some of it)", "selftext": "Hello All,\n\nI have coded a tool in Pine Script (the coding language of Trading View) which gives the probability of a move in % for any asset.\n\n**Why is knowing the probability important?**  \nBecause trading options becomes a process driven exercise and not an exercise based on gut feeling alone. However, knowing the probability doesn't mean it will guarantee the outcome (a Win or Loss). It does guarantee that over time, your wins and losses will be closer to the probabilities that you trade. For example, if a move has a probability of 95%, it doesn't guarantee that it will happen, because there's still a 5% chance that it won't. But, if over time you trade **ONLY** 95% probability events, your wins will be closer to 95%!\n\n**How does knowing the probability help with trading options?**  \nSo the options market prices the options based on probabilities. There's a theory that the sum of the premiums of the call and put options for the **AT THE MONEY (ATM) strike**, divided by the strike price, gives a fairly decent estimate of the expected move in the underlying. **For example, the strike price of an asset is 500, and the 500 call option has a premium of 10 and the 500 put option has a premium of 10, the total premium is 20. This total premium is then divided by the strike price of 500 to give a percentage of 4%. That is the move the options market expects in the asset on either side**. Note, there are multiple sources which say that the total premium to be used ranges from 75 - 95% to estimate the expected percentage move in the asset. I prefer to use 100% of the total premium, as it gives some cushioning. So once we figure out the expected move by the options market, we can use that to figure out the probability of the move happening based on my tool.\n\n# For the Option Buyers in AMZN\n\nAs AMZN results are expected post market hours today, the options market expects a move of about 7.6% for the options expiring on the 3rd of Feb. And as per my tool on Trading View, **the probability of AMZN moving more than 7.5% by the 3rd of Feb. is only 18% (See Image Below).** That means, there's high probability (82%) that you will lose money if the market does not move by at least 7.5% by the 3rd of Feb.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4sgxxnj36sfa1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=02bd3d5f50ea8ec28a9008ca815bef8cddac604a\n\n**However, as I said earlier, this only gives the probability of the move happening, it does not guarantee that a move will happen or not. A very good example - META! The options market were expecting a 9.15% move for the options expiring on the 3rd of Feb. The probability of META moving that much was ONLY 4%! But, it still did move waaaaay beyond 9.15%! (See Image Below).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b76clwr46sfa1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=29119dd3f22d42a7d8392f19ac87641da3f69ea1\n\n**So then how does knowing the probability actually help? What gives?**  \nWell, like I said earlier, knowing the probabilities will help over time and bring your wins and losses closer to the probabilities you trade. **For example, when probabilities of events happening are low, the options for those assets can be written using credit spreads or naked (depending on one's risk appetite). The premium from these credit trades can be used to to buy options or debit spreads (depending on one's preference) in assets whose probabilities are much higher.**\n\n**Note - the trades here will always be short straddles (sell the CE and PE at ATM strike, in equal quantities), when selling, and long strangles (buy the CE and PE at strikes that are 1 - 2 strikes away from ATM, in equal quantities), when buying.**\n\n**The options market priced NFLX to move about 1.55% for the options expiring on the 3rd of Feb. That is a 95% probability event! (See Image Below).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/11erxb366sfa1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=1efe191854c00a9dfe1729efe14478b144cbfe4f\n\nSo a prudent trade would have been to short META ATM CE and PE options and long NFLX CE and PE options 1 - 2 strikes away from the ATM. (A short straddle on META ATM Strike and a Long Strangle on NFLX, 1 - 2 strikes away from ATM). And yes, the META trade would/will give a massive loss, but it would be a 3X or 4X of the premiums credited. However, if NFLX does move over 1.6% (either side) before the expiry on the 3rd of Feb., the NFLX debit trade could yield a 2X or 3X.\n\nThe above was an example of how this tool can effectively be used to trade both the sides. But if someone just wants to buy options, then it makes sense to just trade the high probability trades.\n\n**ENDING NOTE**\n\nThe tool that I have coded is still being tested and hence I have not published it on Trading View as yet. It is a private script. However, Redditors can ask me to look up **ANY assets along with the expiry date of the options** and I can give them the probability and will also keep a track of how does it play out. It will help in actually testing out the tool in live markets.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!\n\nThanks :D", "id": "10rqcin", "created_utc": 1675346026.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m confused.

Economies face inflation risks when the demand for goods and services increase rapidly while supply isn't able to catch up.\n\nTo understand the cause of inflation you need to think about the primary drivers of demand and the bottlenecks of supply in the economy.\n\nIn the 70s the US economy was much more manufacturing focused than it is today. Energy and commodities were a larger cost input to the economy and when these inputs rose companies had to push costs on to consumers. The 70s was also interesting in that it was the decade the baby boomers entered the labour market on mass and started earning.\n\nAs baby boomers started earning they wanted to buy houses, cars and other things which cost large amounts of energy to run and produce. During this period US oil consumption rose rapidly, almost doubling over the decade.\n\nThe problem with oil is that it's not something you can just quickly start producing more of. If you have a shortage, you either have to wait years for supply to catch up or you need to reduce demand. But not only was there a shortage, as I mentioned previously demand for oil during this period just kept rising as the workforce boomed.\n\nThe 70s experienced high inflation because they were hit hard both by rapidly increasing demand and coupled with long-term supply bottlenecks. Neither of which were easily fixable. In fact the market largely fixed the problem over the course of a couple of decades, not by increasing supply, but by focusing on improved energy efficiency and investment in alternative sources of energy.\n\nFast forward to today and oil demand in the US has been flat for decades. Further the US economy isn't as dependant on oil prices like it was in the 70s and is also now a net-exporter of oil. While higher oil prices will have an impact, that impact will be far more muted than in the 70s.\n\nThe US also doesn't have a rapidly growing working population today. In fact it has the exact opposite problem with the boomers now exiting the workforce on mass.\n\nOkay - so what is causing the inflation? Well, in 2020 the whole world went nuts because of this Covid thing and politicians decided to shut down the entire global economy. During this period the supply of global goods dropped rapidly. In a normal recessionary environment this would be fine though because everyone would be losing their jobs and have no money to spend  on goods anyway, but this was no ordinary recession. This time the US pumped trillions of dollars into the economy to prop up demand.\n\nThe result was a massive spike in inflation which is still working it's way through the global economy 3 years on. As I write this consumers are still spending down savings accumulated during Covid. What we saw over the last few years was unprecedented for a recessionary environment, https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT\n\nIn addition to this a significant percentage of the workforce decide not to return to work. Originally this would reduce demand and lower inflation but unlike what normally happens where people retire and check out of the work force because of old age, these people were quitting because they had so much money. This has resulted in a labour shortage which is now pushing up wages.\n\nHowever unlike the 70s long-term there is practically nothing to keep the inflation we're seeing today high imo. Demand for oil in the US will continue to decline as population ages and energy production shifts to more sustainable sources. I'm of the view that tight labour markets don't cause sustained inflation because it's fundamentally a self-correcting problem - as labour has more bargaining power, corporate margins drop reducing demand for labour. Powel probably is correct that labour markets are too tight, but this isn't likely to be a long-term problem imo. And in theory, less workers should reduce economic demand over longer periods while automation and other advancements should continue to increase the affordability and supply of all goods and services. Japan is a good example of an economy which has a declining workforce, yet has the opposite of an inflation problem.\n\nJust my take. I think practically everything is different today from the 70s.", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "With inflation falling rapidly, I would have expected at least some uptick in unemployment.

If other aspects of the economy being studied change, that economy's Philips Curve will likely change with them.\n\nIn the modern world, few countries have negligible imports, and the US$ is used as an international currency - for example, the world oil market is priced in US$, which means that if the international price of oil rises the US will experience inflation for reasons having nothing to do with the domestic economy.  In short, lots of other parts of the economy are moving besides unemployment, and so the notional Philips Curve is constantly changing as well.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I agree. It's kinda surprising, but the Philips curve hasn't been a good predictor of inflation for some time now.\n\nAnd I guess I'm personally just quite sceptical of simple economic models which claim to have high predictability over complex economic dynamics - especially those which are also are widely accepted. I think at best the Philips curve probably has some predictive ability over near-term wage inflation, but the rest is far too complicated for such a simple model to be reliable.\n\nI kinda touched on this in my previous comment, but just think about it for a second - if a company suddenly has to pay it's employees 5% more then what are the knock-on effects of that extra expense? If I increase the cost of your bills by 5% are you going to consume as much? The same applies to companies, it's just they cut down on things like ad spend, fancy offices, and perhaps even their expansion plans. All of this has a deflationary effect elsewhere in the economy, with a slight lag.\n\nIf I had to guess I think what could be happening is that companies are cutting back where they can but a lot of companies are still short of workers. I think this is why you're seeing a lot of tech companies talk about a slow down in things like ad spend and cloud spend, but companies are still hiring where jobs need to be done.\n\nBut eventually it's going to get harder for companies to continuing cutting costs elsewhere and they'll either have to slowdown hiring or take a hit to profit margins. Additionally, the impact of that slow down on non-essential spend will probably weigh on growth in the broader economy over time.\n\nBut I am surprised by it and I think eventually unemployment has to rise because supply / demand imbalances simply can't persist over an extended period of time. Either the supply of workers has to increase (which isn't going to happen) or demand for labour has to be destroyed via higher wages and a slowing economy.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["recession", "inflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Nobody knows.\n\n**One major difference is the energy landscape.

{"title": "Option Buyers in AMZN - This is for you (some of it)", "selftext": "Hello All,\n\nI have coded a tool in Pine Script (the coding language of Trading View) which gives the probability of a move in % for any asset.\n\n**Why is knowing the probability important?**  \nBecause trading options becomes a process driven exercise and not an exercise based on gut feeling alone. However, knowing the probability doesn't mean it will guarantee the outcome (a Win or Loss). It does guarantee that over time, your wins and losses will be closer to the probabilities that you trade. For example, if a move has a probability of 95%, it doesn't guarantee that it will happen, because there's still a 5% chance that it won't. But, if over time you trade **ONLY** 95% probability events, your wins will be closer to 95%!\n\n**How does knowing the probability help with trading options?**  \nSo the options market prices the options based on probabilities. There's a theory that the sum of the premiums of the call and put options for the **AT THE MONEY (ATM) strike**, divided by the strike price, gives a fairly decent estimate of the expected move in the underlying. **For example, the strike price of an asset is 500, and the 500 call option has a premium of 10 and the 500 put option has a premium of 10, the total premium is 20. This total premium is then divided by the strike price of 500 to give a percentage of 4%. That is the move the options market expects in the asset on either side**. Note, there are multiple sources which say that the total premium to be used ranges from 75 - 95% to estimate the expected percentage move in the asset. I prefer to use 100% of the total premium, as it gives some cushioning. So once we figure out the expected move by the options market, we can use that to figure out the probability of the move happening based on my tool.\n\n# For the Option Buyers in AMZN\n\nAs AMZN results are expected post market hours today, the options market expects a move of about 7.6% for the options expiring on the 3rd of Feb. And as per my tool on Trading View, **the probability of AMZN moving more than 7.5% by the 3rd of Feb. is only 18% (See Image Below).** That means, there's high probability (82%) that you will lose money if the market does not move by at least 7.5% by the 3rd of Feb.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4sgxxnj36sfa1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=02bd3d5f50ea8ec28a9008ca815bef8cddac604a\n\n**However, as I said earlier, this only gives the probability of the move happening, it does not guarantee that a move will happen or not. A very good example - META! The options market were expecting a 9.15% move for the options expiring on the 3rd of Feb. The probability of META moving that much was ONLY 4%! But, it still did move waaaaay beyond 9.15%! (See Image Below).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b76clwr46sfa1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=29119dd3f22d42a7d8392f19ac87641da3f69ea1\n\n**So then how does knowing the probability actually help? What gives?**  \nWell, like I said earlier, knowing the probabilities will help over time and bring your wins and losses closer to the probabilities you trade. **For example, when probabilities of events happening are low, the options for those assets can be written using credit spreads or naked (depending on one's risk appetite). The premium from these credit trades can be used to to buy options or debit spreads (depending on one's preference) in assets whose probabilities are much higher.**\n\n**Note - the trades here will always be short straddles (sell the CE and PE at ATM strike, in equal quantities), when selling, and long strangles (buy the CE and PE at strikes that are 1 - 2 strikes away from ATM, in equal quantities), when buying.**\n\n**The options market priced NFLX to move about 1.55% for the options expiring on the 3rd of Feb. That is a 95% probability event! (See Image Below).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/11erxb366sfa1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=1efe191854c00a9dfe1729efe14478b144cbfe4f\n\nSo a prudent trade would have been to short META ATM CE and PE options and long NFLX CE and PE options 1 - 2 strikes away from the ATM. (A short straddle on META ATM Strike and a Long Strangle on NFLX, 1 - 2 strikes away from ATM). And yes, the META trade would/will give a massive loss, but it would be a 3X or 4X of the premiums credited. However, if NFLX does move over 1.6% (either side) before the expiry on the 3rd of Feb., the NFLX debit trade could yield a 2X or 3X.\n\nThe above was an example of how this tool can effectively be used to trade both the sides. But if someone just wants to buy options, then it makes sense to just trade the high probability trades.\n\n**ENDING NOTE**\n\nThe tool that I have coded is still being tested and hence I have not published it on Trading View as yet. It is a private script. However, Redditors can ask me to look up **ANY assets along with the expiry date of the options** and I can give them the probability and will also keep a track of how does it play out. It will help in actually testing out the tool in live markets.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions!\n\nThanks :D", "id": "10rqcin", "created_utc": 1675346026.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m confused.
