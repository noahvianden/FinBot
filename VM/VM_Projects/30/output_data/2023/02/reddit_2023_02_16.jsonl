{"title": "A warning: why the 2020s will become known as a \"lost decade\" for global equities and crypt-doh while bonds enter a golden age.", "selftext": "The last decade of the 2010s began in the ruins of the global financial crisis in 2008. This was an incredibly deflationary period and inflation was at historic lows. To combat the deflationary spiral from the GFC, monetary and fiscal policy was loose, interest rates were 0%, and economic growth was stimulated. This resulted in a bull market in equities that took off and ran for the next decade.\n\nOnce the recovery was certain, global central banks began quantitative tightening measures in 2016 and had intended to normalize interest rates after the 2010's spurred the greatest economic recovery after the global financial crisis of 2008. This policy stopped in 2019 during the U.S./China trade war and then reversed in 2020. OGs remember October - December 2018 and how Yellen spooked the market with interest rate hikes.\n\nThe 2020's began with a global pandemic that originated in China and spread across the world, killing millions of people. This forced central banks to abandon their quantitative tightening policies to stop the global economy from plunging into a deep depression caused by the global pandemic. ZIRP was re-introduced along with a multitude of monetary and fiscal policies to stimulate economic growth during the pandemic. We avoided a generational depression.\n\nIn 2022, central banks began resuming their quantitative tightening policies that they first began in 2016 through 2018. Inflation had begun to rise aggressively in 2021 and central banks acted to tame inflation.\n\nIn 2023, both bond markets and stock markets were expecting inflation to drop quickly back down and for zero interest rates policies to return (ZIRP). It wasn't until the end of 2023 that bond and stock markets realized that the era of ZIRP and TINA (There Is No Alternative) was over and that interest rates would remain perpetually higher in this environment of entrenched inflation and subdued economic growth.\n\nThe Fed will NOT bring back ZIRP. Why? Because ZIRP is contingent upon inflation being low and inflation is NOT low. Please let go of the delusion that the easy money train is coming back. It left. And if you missed this once in a lifetime opportunity to make millions of dollars, then unfortunately you probably never will.\n\nThis reality might be starting to sink in for investors after the most recent CPI and PPI reports, which showed that inflation is either entrenched or starting to rise again. Either way, this means that interest rates are going higher and staying longer.\n\nCentral banks are attempting to unwind their balance sheets as well. Nobody wants to buy these assets on their books right now and so rates will continue to climb until a point where the Fed can offload these bonds to institutions that will buy them. This is simple demand destruction for assets and a forced reduction of liquidity for capital markets. As the Fed balance sheet draws down...so too shall the stonk market.\n\nBy 2024 I'm expecting that economists and pundits will begin to make the term \"post-growth economics\" begin trending and everyone will start talking about what this means for equity investors. We have also had a public push for \"equity\" and \"wealth redistribution\". These things will affect the appetite for stocks.\n\nThe US economy is extremely robust and this will actually work against equity investors since there will not be a severe recession, but growth will be severely crippled. When looking at labor participation rates, an aging population, and the cost of capital increasing, this does not paint a pretty picture for the future returns of stocks.\n\nEquities will continue a protracted bear market because investors no longer need to accept the risk profile of equities. Bond yields are - and will continue to become - more attractive.\n\nTaxes will also have to be raised and the rich along with corporations will be the logical target for tax rate hikes. This isn't political, it's just a logical conclusion based upon the facts.\n\nPublic companies will have to raise their dividend payouts to compete for shareholders against bond yields. Stock buybacks will become a thing of the past, as will frivolous IPO cash grabs and SPAC frenzies.\n\nCrypt-doh bros and girls are going to lose everything because imaginary digital coins were an \"asset\" that ONLY did well in a ZIRP environment. As I mentioned earlier that is never coming back unless we find ourselves 1) in an era of perpetually low interest rates and 2) find ourselves also entering an economic contraction. DO NOT buy this digital trash as you will lose everything.\n\nBe very careful about your individual financial needs and take calculated risks. The era of foolishly gambling money because everything it literally going up is over and probably not coming back. Find Alpha where you can but do not be complacent or reckless. Many people will lose everything over the next few years as the market comes to grips with this paradigm shift.\n\nI didn't even address the risk of a U.S. Default which is still a possibility. Regardless of the outcome of the debt limit in the short term, JPow has reiterated that the U.S. will need to have a reckoning with respect to its path of financial solvency. Again, assuming that we raise the debt ceiling, the cost of capital will continue to increase and an era of business and government austerity will become an eventuality.\n\nTread carefully.\n\nTLDR: nothing has changed with respect to the terminal path of monetary policy for the United States. We were already on this path before Covid-19 popped up and there was a once in a lifetime opportunity to make millions with this massive liquidity explosion. However, now that ship has sailed and we will continue on the path of removing liquidity and normalizing interest rates for a post-growth economy in the 2020s and beyond.", "id": "113yhk0", "created_utc": 1676574843.0, "score": 11, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 31, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|3|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|339|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: The 2020s are NOT going to be a repeat of the 2010s.
