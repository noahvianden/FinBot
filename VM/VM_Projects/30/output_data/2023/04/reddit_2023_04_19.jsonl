Both appear to be \u201cset it and forget it\u201d bids as their % change in ownership from the transactions were both < 1%.\n\nThere were a few CEO purchases pushing 6-figures:\n\n* Scott Myers, Viridian Therapeutics ($VRDN): $101,479\n* Thomson Leighton, Akamai Technologies: $100,175\n* Steven Brass, Wd 40 Co: $99,927\n\nAnd today I learned that WD-40 operates as a standalone company.\n\n# Notable sales from insiders:\n\n* Catz Safra, the CEO of Oracle ($ORCL / Software - Infrastructure) sold 63.24% of their common stock stake in a **$181M sale** on April 12th. **Another $288M** in common stock was sold on April 10th.\n* Sessa Capital Fund, a 10% owner of Provention Bio ($PRVB / Biotechnology), sold 12.34% of their stake in a $53.2M sale on April 14th\n* Sanat Chattopadhyay, an EVP at Merck & Co ($MRK / Drug Manufacturers - General), sold 100% of their stake in a $15.4M sale on April 13th\n* Luca Maestri, the CFO of Apple ($AAPL / Consumer Electronics), sold 39.4% of their stake in an $11.5M sale on April 13th\n* Todd Simpson, the CFO of Seagen ($SGEN / Biotechnology), sold 41.32% of his stake in an $11.3M sale on April 10th\n* Bruce Sachs, a Director at Vertex Pharmaceuticals ($VRTX / Biotechnology), sold 34.07% of his stake in a $6.9M sale on April 12th\n\n# Notable buys from insiders:\n\n* David Daniel, a Director at Domo ($DOMO / Software - Application) purchased 47,500 shares of stock in a $684K purchase on April 13th\n* Tanner Geoff, the President, and COO of Simply Good Foods ($SMPL / Packaged Foods) bought 6,912 shares in a $250K purchase on April 10th\n\n# High-Level Stats:\n\n* Purchases increased from $1.7M to $9.7M (+460%)\n* Sales increased from $700M to $1.4B (+103%)\n* Transactions decreased from 481 to 326 (-32%)\n* Companies represented in Form 4s decreased from 257 to 190 (-26%)\n   * Net buyers increased from 9 to 16 (+78%)\n   * Net sellers decreased from 248 to 174 (-30%)\n* Insiders filing Form 4s decreased from 431 to 277 (-36%)\n   * Net buyers increased from 11 to 22 (+100%)\n   * Net sellers decreased from 420 to 255 (-39%)\n\n# Transaction Selection\n\n1. **All** **Open Market Transactions** from **April 10th - April 14th.** These are Form 4 filings with a Transaction Code of \u201cP\u201d or \u201cS\u201d.

The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\\*roughly\\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.\n2.

{"title": "What to do for Tesla's Earnings Tonight", "selftext": "Tesla (TSLA) is about to release Q1 2023 financial results today after the markets close. As usual, a conference call and Q&A with Tesla\u2019s management are scheduled after the results. These tend to move the stock big time, so the stakes are high for investors and degens like us. Options will definitely be fun to play with.\n\nIn this post, we\u2019ll take a look at what both the street and retail investors are expecting for the quarterly results.\n\n**Tesla Q1 2023 deliveries**\n\nAs usual, Tesla already disclosed its Q1 vehicle delivery and production numbers, which drive the vast majority of the company\u2019s revenue. Earlier this month, Tesla confirmed that [it delivered a new record of over 422,000 electric vehicles during the first quarter of the year.](https://electrek.co/2023/04/02/tesla-tsla-confirms-q1-2023-record-deliveries-beats-expectations/) Tesla also confirmed having produced 440,000 vehicles during the quarter \u2013 also a new record. Delivery and production numbers are always slightly adjusted during earning results.\n\n**Tesla Q1 2023 revenue**\n\nFor revenue, analysts generally have a pretty good idea of what to expect, thanks to the delivery numbers. The Wall Street consensus for this quarter is $23.617 billion, and [Estimize](https://www.estimize.com/sectors), the financial estimate crowdsourcing website, predicts a higher revenue of $24.048 billion.\n\nDespite the new record number of deliveries, these estimates would represent a quarter-to-quarter decrease in revenue due to Tesla\u2019s implementing large price cuts during the first quarter. Lower prices are probably a smart strategy considering higher interest rates, the potential for economic deceleration in 2023, more competition, and the new rules for tax credits under the [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/the-inflation-reduction-act-heres-whats-in-it). Nonetheless, it would be a massive year-over-year increase from $18 billion in revenue in Q1 2022.\n\nHere are the predictions for Tesla\u2019s revenue over the past two years, where Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus is in gray, and actual results are in green: https://i.imgur.com/t7l4Nyj.jpg\n\n**Tesla Q1 2023 earnings**\n\nTesla always attempts to be marginally profitable every quarter as it invests most of its money into growth, and it has been successful in doing so over the last two years now. For Q1 2023, the Wall Street consensus is a gain of $0.85 per share, while Estimize\u2019s prediction is higher with a profit of $0.94 per share.\n\nThe estimates have a wide range this quarter because of the price cuts Tesla implemented during the quarter. Analysts and investors are looking to see how badly it is going to affect Tesla\u2019s margins and, ultimately, its profits. Unsurprisingly, Tesla achieving the Wall Street consensus would be a big drop in earnings quarter-to-quarter, and the automaker would be flat on earnings year-over-year.\n\nHere are the earnings per share over the last two years, where Estimize predictions are in blue, Wall Street consensus is in gray, and actual results are in green: https://i.imgur.com/rlj48di.png\n\n**Other expectations for the TSLA shareholder\u2019s letter and analyst call**\n\nThe obvious thing is the gross margin. Investors are going to be looking for that number first. They want to know by how much it dropped and how much room there is since Tesla continued to drop prices after the end of the quarter. If Tesla can stay in the mid to high teens, I think investors will be happy, but if it dips lower than that, they might have a problem. Investors will also be looking at insights from management about the pricing strategy, which seems to be changing fast.\n\nTesla shareholders will also be looking on an update on [Cybertruck production](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/25/23571806/tesla-cybertruck-volume-production-delay-2024-q4-2022) as the start of production gets closer, but knowing Tesla management, I wouldn\u2019t expect much more than it being on track for a start of production this summer and volume production next year. Cybertruck should not have a material impact on Tesla\u2019s revenue in 2023.\n\nI assume that amid margins going down, Tesla investors are going to want to have an update on [Tesla\u2019s self-driving program](https://www.tesla.com/en_CA/autopilot), which has helped margins in the past, but the program has been stalling for a while now.\n Shareholders will also be particularly interested in Tesla Energy this quarter and its potential future impact on Tesla\u2019s financials. It has been a growing business for Tesla and with a [ramp-up in Megapack production](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2023/03/13/teslas-investor-day-ramping-up-the-megapack-business/), it should be bigger in Q1, but I wouldn\u2019t expect a massive jump in deployment until the second half of the year. We will see what Tesla has to say about that.\n\n**Trading Tesla Stock: Technical Analysis**\n\nTrading Tesla stock is not for the faint-hearted. Shares have [produced sizable annualized volatility of 64%](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2023&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=TSLA&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=SPY&allocation2_2=100) since inception. In plain English: as much as investing in the S&P 500 is risky, investing in TSLA has historically been nearly five times riskier!\n\nOf course, the possibility of even more intense price moves, either to the upside or downside, gets magnified around earnings day. To help figure things out, Wall Street Memes recently published a strategy for [trading Tesla stock](https://www.thestreet.com/memestocks/other-memes/tesla-stock-the-charts-send-a-clear-message).\n\nTo recap, TSLA has been struggling to break free of the 200-day moving average to the upside ([see here](https://i.imgur.com/S3SqpCf.png)). The good news is that selling pressure should ease each time that the stock gets denied further gains at the moving average, as the pool of sellers at that level shrinks.\n\nIf or when Tesla stock overcomes the hurdle, there is the possibility that a $300 price target set by the next key resistance level would open up a huge opportunity for bulls. Getting there from current levels implies a gain potential of over 60%. Such a move may sound like wishful thinking, but keep in mind that TSLA is all about high-risk and high reward. Earnings day is important because it could present the key catalyst that confirms the viability of the bullish trade \u2013 or rejects it at once.\n\n**So what to do for earnings?**\n\nFor all the reasons above, I think it would be reasonable to get a strangle on Tesla. For the noobies, a straddle is an options strategy where we buy both a call option and a put option on the same underlying stock with the same strike price and expiration date. This strategy is typically used if we believe the stock price will experience a significant price movement but is unsure of the direction. Grabbing the 4/21 190c and 170p doesn't seem like a bad idea. The stock will certainly move.", "id": "12s2zqb", "created_utc": 1681923928.0, "score": 12, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|6 days ago\n**Total Comments**|24|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12qxya3/what_to_do_for_netflix_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12s2zqb/what_to_do_for_teslas_earnings_tonight/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/12kvaap/your_play_for_uhn_earnings_tomorrow/) \n**Account Age**|1 week|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/CalmGains, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: Tesla is about to release Q1 2023 financial results today after the markets close.

Now this also becomes an issue here\u2026 \n\nWhy? Well we established a new Demand\u2026 which should be a support however, that demand was established above current price action and actually is exactly where we found resistance EOD today. \n\nSo this is where things get choppy and hard to really find direction and make sense of it.. we should push to the next supply which is 415.36 and 417.03\u2026 however, we could drop to previous supplies below at 411.04 and 409.73. \n\nWe are for sure in chop right now. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hl7s4kbdiwua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=709d9d0a33dfb7df25549525c603bc60baf26de5\n\nNow we break through the rising wedge that has been support for over a month now. That should in and of itself be a very bearish omen for the markets\u2026 However, we once again bounced hard off the daily 8ema. The trend has officially broken\u2026 but we continue to hold the daily 8ema\u2026 Lots of chop and no continuation. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 409.7 -> 411 -> 415.4 -> 417  \n Demand- 414.2 -> 409.2  \n Support- 412.1 -> 409.1  \n Resistance- 414.1 -> 415.6 -> 416.8\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0hzoresdiwua1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce80c498f76cf3c5ab96856dbdb4f87ffaa5855f\n\nThis is where it is very helpful to watch futures and SPY at the same time\u2026 Futures shows a slightly different picture then SPY\u2026 what im seeing here is that yes we DID bounce hard off the daily 8ema but what we got stopped in our tracks at 4178 supply\u2026 IF we were to get a huge green day tomorrow we could potentially turn 4178 into a new demand (support) which would be extremely bullish. However, if this 4178 resistance holds right now then we start talking about a push back to 4116 demand. \n\nOne other thing that happened on futures is that we did take out 4160 and 4154 supplies today. However on SPY we did not take out any previous supplies. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f6n3hk6eiwua1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bb34b7fe68163148672f026dc27f54a014df986\n\nWe also broke the rising wedge and put our 4th daily doji in a row in\u2026 there does appear to be a 4198 rejection and possible carrot top forming here\u2026 \n\nWith the daily 8ema still holding as support that pretty much is the last support to watch before we start the next leg down\u2026 this decent miss on Tesla COULD start the next leg down. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4178 -> 4198  \n Demand- 4116   \n Support- 4154 -> 4139  \n Resistance- 4178 -> 4198\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ujze52oeiwua1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bcb823212fd69466b0cde46798d17bc01a6410f\n\nThe VIX once again put in a new 52 week low\u2026 and not only that this current level the VIX just hit is as low as the VIX was the last time SPY was at an ATH\u2026 \n\nOn paper and realistically and logically (haha) the VIX daily broke its massive falling wedge and SPY/ Futures broke its rising wedge\u2026 those two doing that together SHOULD signal a sell off on Spy is imminent\u2026 but the market has proved us to be irrational. \n\nI still overall remain bearish and still hold my 93dte 405P which are down about 16%. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z5n47mbfiwua1.png?width=911&format=png&auto=webp&s=135cfbafbe84bc6a4a555de1a1f8b370c97c3a36\n\nA pretty decent day of scalping and trading today\u2026 I got chopped up pretty good mid day when we were fighting aggressively at 413.5 for so long. Days like today become increasingly frustrating to trade and we once again held a less than $3 range all day. \n\nI have had a lot of people ask why I went back to SPX\u2026 \n\nI predominantly for anyone who has been following me for a long time traded SPX 0dte all of 2022\u2026 I killed it on scalp game\u2026 however once 0dte evertday SPY and SPX hit the markets honestly 0dte just weren\u2019t it anymore\u2026\n\nI know others have had the same issue but there was this detachment of SPX premiums (mostly 0dte) and actual SPY/ SPX movement\u2026 meaning often times I would enter and have a good entry and SPY WOULD move down (if I bought a put) however, my put would actually lose value\u2026 there were also other times where it seemed like we got a huge move in premiums when SPY wouldn\u2019t even move\u2026 \n\nI got away from 0dte and when I did that I went back to SPY (mostly cause SPX was too expensive due to the VIX being so high AND spread on further out SPX are not as favorable). Well recently I have worked my way back down to 2 dte and now im back at 1dte\u2026 this means I was trading on average 10-15 contracts of SPY every trade and burning a lot of commission every day\u2026 I am temporarily using SPX now because 1. It saves on commission (only 2 contracts vs 10-15)\u2026 2. Its 60/40 tax benefits and 3. SPX has a way of moving that if you learn it can be very favorable to option buyers. \n\nIn all reality trading SPY or SPX is one and in the same\u2026 smaller accounts (those buying less than 10 contracts at a time) really would benefit from SPY and I honestly think SPY options move better and easier than SPX does\u2026 but anyone trading 10+ contracts should seriously look at SPX\u2026 just be mindful of the spreads if trading further than 0-1DTE.", "id": "12s9361", "created_utc": 1681936233.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|4728|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1144ms6/50_bps_hike_the_nail_in_the_bear_coffin_21623_spy/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: * SPY bulls need to prove they can take out the 414.1 supply and the 415.6 resistance**", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2521868348121643}, {"body": "Jeez this month long low volatility is really frustrating.
