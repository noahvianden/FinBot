{"title": "Tesla\u2019s shares are up over 70% this year. One market pro is bullish \u2014 but another isn\u2019t convinced", "selftext": "Shares of electric vehicle giant Tesla have risen more than 70% this year, after falling 65% in 2022 in its largest-ever annual decline.\n\nInvestors have flocked to the EV darling, with rising appetite for growth stocks and signs of a rebound in EV demand. But competition is getting stiffer and there\u2019s the prospect of further price cuts.\n\nSo is it time to buy the stock? Two investors faced off on CNBC\u2019s \u201cStreet Signs Asia\u201d on Wednesday.\n\nBull vs. bear\n\nRoss Gerber, president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth Management, is an unabashed Tesla bull.\n\nTo him, Tesla is the undisputed \u201cleader in the world globally\u201d in sustainable transportation and energy.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at a company whose full focus is advancing sustainable transportation and energy, Tesla\u2019s technology is so far advanced, and I\u2019m just talking the technology around EVs and not even talking full self-driving technology, but just the technology that they have built is so far advanced that their moat is so deep that they will be a leader for hopefully a decade or more to come,\u201d he said.\n\nGerber added that Tesla is already producing more EVs than any other automaker in the world, save for BYD. And it\u2019s only \u201cat the beginning\u201d of a \u201cmassive shift\u201d from oil-based infrastructure.\n\nGerber is excited about the prospects for Tesla\u2019s first pickup truck \u2014 the Cybertruck \u2014 which is expected to begin production by end-2023.\n\nHe named \u201cunrelenting pressure\u201d on margins as one such downside, given the stiff competition in the EV industry. Tesla cannot be the EV leader without cutting prices, Bido added.\n\n\u201cThe exact reason why you need to be a bull is that the Cybertruck is coming. And the truck business is a massive opportunity not just for Tesla, but for Rivian, Ford and many others that are going to go into the truck business,\u201d he said, calling the market \u201cmassive.\u201d\n\nBut Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager of Integrated Alpha Group at F/m Investments, said now\u2019s not the time to bet on Tesla.\n\n\u201cWe have a quantitative process at Integrated Alpha. And because of this process, it\u2019s leading me to believe that Tesla is not really a good investment at this point. We look at our quant scores, and then we look at the story behind Tesla and we\u2019re not that happy with it. We believe it has more downside than upside,\u201d he said.\n\nGerber, however, said he\u2019s expecting margin growth later in the year. \u201cI think the worst is happening now for margins, and I think margins will get better throughout time,\u201d he added. \u00a0\n\nThough the first quarter looks \u201cquestionable\u201d to Gerber, he expects Tesla to see \u201cmassive\u201d cost savings once its Gigafactory in Berlin reaches \u201cprofitable scale.\u201d\n\nOne of the most important components of an EV is the battery, and Gerber said Tesla is a leader in battery technology.\n\nTesla works with Panasonic and Contemporary Amperex Technology to supply batteries for its vehicles, and also produces batteries through its massive Gigafactories \u2014 an advantage that competitors such as Ford and GM don\u2019t have, Gerber said.\n\nBut Bido is less bullish when it comes to Tesla\u2019s leadership in battery EVs. \u201cToyota has the most and the highest number of patents for EV batteries,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have it, not Tesla.\u201d\n\n\u2018Over-promising and under-delivering\u2019\n\nTesla\u2019s first-quarter vehicle deliveries may have fallen short of Wall Street\u2019s expectations, but they represent an improvement from the previous quarter and were in line with the company\u2019s own guidance.\n\nBut according to Bido, it\u2019s not enough that a company like Tesla merely meets expectations.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s simply not enough to get them forward. That\u2019s not a strategy for the long term. That\u2019s just getting a run in the short term, right? That doesn\u2019t tell me anything about what they\u2019re going to do next year,\u201d he said.\n\nBido said Tesla has to \u201cget past this stage of over-promising and under-delivering,\u201d citing the Cybertruck as an area in which the company has overpromised. \u201cPromises are not good enough. You really have to deliver at some point.\u201d He urged investors to \u201cdo their homework\u201d and examine the competition.\n\nBut Gerber, for his part, said Tesla is a buy, given that it\u2019s fairly valued and is trading at \u201cfar\u201d multiples for its potential and its long-term growth rate.\n\n\u201cYou have this wonderful opportunity to invest long term in an extremely unique company that is a leader in their industry and in many different segments of technology,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because it\u2019s an extremely volatile investment, they should dollar cost average into the company and they will be best-served in the long term.\u201d\n\nFull article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/11/two-market-pros-on-whats-next-for-tesla-after-share-price-surge-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/11/two-market-pros-on-whats-next-for-tesla-after-share-price-surge-.html)\n\nRoss Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth Management has said Tesla (TSLA) is a buy at this point, given that it\u2019s fairly valued and is trading at \u201cfar\u201d multiples for its potential and its long-term growth rate. On the other hand, Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager at F/m Investments, said now\u2019s not the time to buy TSLA.

We believe it has more downside than upside,\u201d he said.\n\nGerber, however, said he\u2019s expecting margin growth later in the year. \u201cI think the worst is happening now for margins, and I think margins will get better throughout time,\u201d he added. \u00a0\n\nThough the first quarter looks \u201cquestionable\u201d to Gerber, he expects Tesla to see \u201cmassive\u201d cost savings once its Gigafactory in Berlin reaches \u201cprofitable scale.\u201d\n\nOne of the most important components of an EV is the battery, and Gerber said Tesla is a leader in battery technology.\n\nTesla works with Panasonic and Contemporary Amperex Technology to supply batteries for its vehicles, and also produces batteries through its massive Gigafactories \u2014 an advantage that competitors such as Ford and GM don\u2019t have, Gerber said.\n\nBut Bido is less bullish when it comes to Tesla\u2019s leadership in battery EVs. \u201cToyota has the most and the highest number of patents for EV batteries,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have it, not Tesla.\u201d\n\n\u2018Over-promising and under-delivering\u2019\n\nTesla\u2019s first-quarter vehicle deliveries may have fallen short of Wall Street\u2019s expectations, but they represent an improvement from the previous quarter and were in line with the company\u2019s own guidance.\n\nBut according to Bido, it\u2019s not enough that a company like Tesla merely meets expectations.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s simply not enough to get them forward. That\u2019s not a strategy for the long term. That\u2019s just getting a run in the short term, right? That doesn\u2019t tell me anything about what they\u2019re going to do next year,\u201d he said.\n\nBido said Tesla has to \u201cget past this stage of over-promising and under-delivering,\u201d citing the Cybertruck as an area in which the company has overpromised. \u201cPromises are not good enough. You really have to deliver at some point.\u201d He urged investors to \u201cdo their homework\u201d and examine the competition.\n\nBut Gerber, for his part, said Tesla is a buy, given that it\u2019s fairly valued and is trading at \u201cfar\u201d multiples for its potential and its long-term growth rate.\n\n\u201cYou have this wonderful opportunity to invest long term in an extremely unique company that is a leader in their industry and in many different segments of technology,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd because it\u2019s an extremely volatile investment, they should dollar cost average into the company and they will be best-served in the long term.\u201d\n\nFull article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/11/two-market-pros-on-whats-next-for-tesla-after-share-price-surge-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/11/two-market-pros-on-whats-next-for-tesla-after-share-price-surge-.html)\n\nRoss Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth Management has said Tesla (TSLA) is a buy at this point, given that it\u2019s fairly valued and is trading at \u201cfar\u201d multiples for its potential and its long-term growth rate. On the other hand, Francisco Bido, senior portfolio manager at F/m Investments, said now\u2019s not the time to buy TSLA.
