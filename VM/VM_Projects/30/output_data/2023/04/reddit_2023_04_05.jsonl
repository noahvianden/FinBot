The two main problems are gonna be:\n\n* Are you ok if you sell CSPs and GOOGL shoots upwards?\n* Are you ok to hold GOOGL if your CSP gets assigned?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf the first one happens, you may find that you will close your CSP for nearly 100% profit, but then find that you can't open a second CSP because the share price has gone so far up that you can't write a new CSP at a reasonable strike that gives a decent amount of premium. So either you will have to hope GOOGL comes down or find a new stock to work with. Overall this isn't too bad a problem to have.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe second one is the tough one. If GOOGL sharply falls and you get assigned, and if you try to sell CCs but don't want to sell them lower than your cost basis, you may find yourself in a situation where your CCs either need to be sold for nearly nothing because they are so far OTM or that you have to sell CCs very far into the future just to collect any sort of real premium. How you handle this will be the big struggle because being locked into a stock for potentially years in hopes that its share price appreciates enough can wear a person down. Especially when the CCs you sell barely wear down the cost basis. Picking a decent company helps to alleviate some of the pain because you won't feel as on edge as you wait.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOtherwise your strategy looks like a pretty classic crossover strategy but through the use of CSPs rather than going long on shares, so your risk will be similar to that, which is mostly \"what if the shares drop fast?\". Best of luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know you already know what Wheeling is since you used the term, but as a reference in case other newbies come along, here is the link where this concept of The Wheel is talked about: [The Wheel](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/)", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Those are great points. I think if I get put the shares I would probably look for CCs that are far enough OTM to be unlikely to get assigned. .8 delta or so. I\u2019m ok with getting my way back to my cost basis in chunks. Does that seem reasonable ?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I am going to make some assumptions, and if I assumed incorrectly, please correct me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy assumptions:\n\n* When you said an unlikely delta, you meant something like 0.08 rather than 0.8 because 0.8 would be heavily ITM for a covered call.\n* This very OTM, low delta call you are writing would still potentially be at a strike that is under your cost basis, ie you got assigned 100 shares at $250 a share, and this OTM call could be $230.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnder these assumptions, the big risk you run is that the stock swings back upward and puts your CC ITM and thus gets assigned. Which now means you are down $20 a share in our example. If your premiums from the CSP and the CC don't amount to $20, you are at a net loss. The odds of this would be low, however they do happen. Tail end events like that don't quite follow the normal distribution, so they can happen more likely than anticipated. Take it from me. I have spent a lot of time dealing with these optimization issues, and the reason why I have to deal with them at all is because, despite how rare they should be, they do happen, and they can not only eat all the profits collected from writing, but actually send you negative. Imagine writing for 12 months just to have 1 bad month send you back to square one.  \n\n\nThus you have two choices:\n\n1. Do you risk writing CCs under your cost basis on the chance that the scenario I described above happens?\n2. Do you instead grin and bear it, and sell CCs that are at/above your cost basis knowing that you could be selling for pennies for as long as the stock price remains depressed?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen depending on which choice you go with, you can then try to tailor them to your risk. For example in #1, you could either write CCs at strikes that are only ever so slightly under your total cost basis, so you don't end up losing much, or you could risk much lower than your cost basis in an attempt to collect more premium (hoping that the stock does not shoot back up during the life of that contract).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope that helps, and once again let me know if I misunderstood your question.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5734732151031494}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5901821851730347}], "tickers": ["googl", "intc"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Don\u2019t wheel around earnings.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Ok.

The delay between the Filing Date and the Transaction Date is **\\*roughly\\*** 2 days and your mileage will vary. This means that **more transactions for past dates can arrive in future filings.** That is why looking at larger trends is key.\n2.

How would I use this data?\n\nI'm thinking (and assume there's additional DD/TA done on stocks):\n\n- look at the sellers. Why are they selling, is there an obvious reason, if not, does it look suspicious?\n\n- look at the buyers. Why are they buying, how much are they increasing their amount, are their projects in the pipeline (I presume that simply increasing shards of before an earning pump is not something these guys would be doing?)?\n\nThe rest, I'm not too sure and could use some guidance! Always keen to learn more (even if you just send me to a book - I'll read it).\n\nAnd thanks for your time doing this, it must take a lot of work! Do you work in stocks day to day; is this a potential side hustle earner; etc.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No worries! We're all learning at our own pace.\n\nIt is easier to draw conclusions about buying activity; there is an old adage along the lines of \"people sell for multiple reasons, but they buy if they think the price will rise\". So  you can certainly look at things like:\n\n* The dollar value of their purchase\n* Whether it's a significant increase in shares owned (% basis)\n* Is their purchase a significant % of the company float (shares outstanding)\n* Did other folks from the company recently buy shares\n* Is this a second, third, etc. purchase in recent days/weeks\n\nThat of course would only be looking at an individual company and/or insider\n\nAs a second example, monitoring the total purchases on a sector/industry level could signal a thematic event that impacts multiple companies. It's more subjective, but I do think it provides an opportunity to isolate peculiar behaviors. \n\nI view this as another tool in the kit when performing due diligence that can lead to questions that aren't as apparent when viewing other data points. In addition, insiders are still human and often don't get the timing right. I think we'd all agree that a confluence of signals, insider purchases being one of them, is always more interesting.\n\nAs for books, I found \"One Up On Wall Street\" by Peter Lynch and \"Insider Buy Superstocks\" by Jesse Stine to offer interesting views on how to evaluate stocks. William O'Neill also has a rather cheesy, yet fantastic, book called 'How To Make Money In Stocks'.\n\nI'm glad to put this together! I spent a few years in finance before changing gears to engineering. I've been poking around this data for over two years as a hobby/side interest.
