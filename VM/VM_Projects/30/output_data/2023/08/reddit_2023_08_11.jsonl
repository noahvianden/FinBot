I think people just spend too much, eating out everyday, garbage food that's not good for you anyways. They get a raise and instead of maintaining their current lifestyle, they add more things, instead of living the same and investing the new surplus. New cars, bigger house/apartment, that adds up to quite a bit.\n\nBut yes I agree, people shouldn't be robbing themselves of the little things in the hopes of becoming rich, reading WSB. The little \"wins\" and happiness add up too!", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "My wife and I looked at our spending for Postmates and we've been spending around $600-800 a month on food since spring. We know it's really fucked up, but it's also because we can afford it and aren't hurting financially in any way, and it saves us having to cook after busting our butts at work all day and we get to spend about two hours together before bed. I'd thought to myself that if I had put that money into the market I could have profited from gains but also realized that I also could have easily lost it all as well. If I had to make the choice once more I still would just order food v.s. investing with that money, because I actually get something tangible and immediately to enjoy and I don't know 100% if that investment would produce the same results.\n\nI'm totally guessing but assuming that people with lower incomes more or less apply that same logic but use the lottery and scratchoffs or something to create the same justification as with me and the stock market (and crypto). I think that most people would and are overwhelmed about trying to actually critically think about their finances to such a degree, where they have to think and plan years out.\n\nSociety of short attention spans and lack of imagination.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'm totally with you. However I'm a single dude, so I don't really have another person's happiness to consider. The way I think of it, is I try to cook on days I will eat alone, and go out for meals with friends or dates. If I used UberEats or Postmates every other day, I could easily rack up $400-$600 a month. It's all a balance which is what I was trying to describe in my previous post. Don't short yourself all of the short term happiness from eating tasty food or whatever you want to spend your money on, but not thinking about your future and retirement is going to hurt a helluva lot more than skipping Chick-fil-A a couple times a month. Balance/moderation is the game.\n\nAs far as losing all the money you save, that all depends on your investment choices. I'd be willing to wager a pretty penny that if you just DCAed into the S&P 500 and held onto it for 5-10 years, you would make a decent return, or at least beat out inflation by a couple percent. \n\nFor your example, $600/mo is $7200 a year. Let's say the $SPY (S&P ETF) average annualized return is 6% after accounting for inflation, you're looking at $7632 for the first year, which becomes $50222.29 at the 5 year mark, given that you completely stop eating out and continue to invest the $600/mo. Just for fun, at 10 years, you would have $107,795.83, after only contributing $79,200.00. That's pretty fantastic if you ask me.\n\nAnd if anyone claims that it's not safe because of the stock market, I have several questions for you:\n1) What do you think 401(k)s or other retirements are based off of?\n2) If the S&P 500 collapses, we have bigger problems than pinching pennies and eating out. It is essentially an ETF based on the almost every sector of the stock market, the world economy would have to collapse.\n\nIf you are still worried about it, get a HYSA, which is about a 4% return. \n\nI guess all I am trying to say is: 1)  that everything is fine in moderation, and 2) the power of compounding interest.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["inflation"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5944520235061646}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.56218421459198}, {"body": "The first year would be \\~$1305.
