A common rule of thumb is that two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth mean recession, although more complex formulas are also used.\"\n\nAccording to the rule of thumb above and OECD data, the last recession was Q1 and Q2 of 2022, with GDP changes from previous quarter of -0.4 and -0.1, respectively. However moving forward chronologically Q3 22 to Q1 23 values were +0.8, +0.6, and +0.3. Though declining, this does not meet the parameters to be considered a recession, at least not based on the rule of thumb. Unfortunately, I was unable to attach a photo of this chart, but here is a link:https://data.oecd.org/chart/7a55\n\nMore importantly, in my humble opinion, it states later on the Investopedia page: **\"However, the NBER also says there is \u201cno fixed rule about what measures contribute information to the process or how they are weighted in our decisions.\u201d\"**\n\nIt's not outside the realm of possibility that because of how the economy has changed and evolved, that the former \"definition\" of recession is now no longer applicable to the current economic situation. \n\nI feel like, looking at the broader picture here are some factors that lead me to believe things are going to be sideways/flat at best, or downtrending in the near future:\n-Inflation is barely slowing down, the FED has said they would lower rates for months now, and earlier this week admitted they would probably need to keep them up. \n-Housing market is garbage, high rates, low inventory/volume. \n-Weekly Bankruptcy filings have increased to levels similar to 2008. \n-Bond yields also highest since 2008. -S&P500 is overvalued by 19/20 metrics.\n-Historical poor overall market performance in Aug-Oct. \n-Total credit card debt has increased, and so have student loan debt (though these last 2 could be attributed to a growing population). \n-Though some student loans will be forgiven, there was a moratorium on the interest because of COVID, which ends and interest/loan payments resume 1 Sep. \n-There has been an increase in the % of debt that is 90 days past due.  \n-Rising Bond yields (correlated with high inflation). \n-US credit received a downgrade. \n-Big banks (like JP Morgan Chase, BofA, Golman Sachs, etc) are about to be downgraded as well. \n\n-China's looming, slow motion housing collapse. \n-China cutting rates and facing inflation/deflation issues.\n\nOof course, the market doesn't always behave like you would expect it to. Guess, we shall see what happens! \n\nI will gladly hear any counter-arguments or criticisms \ud83d\ude0a", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["gdp", "inflation", "recession", "deflation"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Could be right for now.
