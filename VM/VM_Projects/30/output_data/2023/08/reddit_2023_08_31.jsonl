{"title": "Match Group (MTCH) DCF Analysis: Tinder, Hinge and OkCupid DCF.", "selftext": "# INTRODUCTION:\n\nMTCH the parent company for a large number of successful dating apps e.g. Tinder, Hinge and OkCupid, their growth has grinded to a halt recently with a very unique business model where the more successful/effective their product is the more subscribers they lose. Management has laid out several game plans such as increasing marketing spend, releasing higher priced tier e.g. HingeX and Price & Margin Optimization through removing introduction & discount pricing. \r  \n\n\n# \rREVENUE:\n\nThe largest difficulty I faced when forecasting subscribers for MTCH is their unique business model. However, good dating apps are able to grow faster than their subscribers churn as the word of mouth advertisement and successful couples being a walking billboard for them are all a crucial part of the business model of MTCH. So, when creating a revenue model I was under the assumption that the churn isn\u2019t to a significant amount. I believe it's much less accurate to try and forecast churn into my \u201colder\u201d subscribers and project from there as I\u2019d be making far bolder assumptions than simply assuming subscribers grow at a faster pace than churn.\r  \n\r  \nThe direction for revenue that management is taking is \u201clonger term\u2026We'll essentially have fewer payers but at higher price points.\u201d - 2022 Q4 Earnings Conference.\r  \n\r  \nFactors affecting the growth rate of revenue/payers and amount of payers is \u201cPrevalence of smartphones in the market\u201d and \u201caffluence of the market\u201d. ([SOURCE](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-trends/App-makers-cash-in-as-Southeast-Asia-falls-for-mobile-dating)) \r  \nAPAC Payers growth is very dependent on consumers getting smartphones or pivoting from traditional methods of dating e.g. Matchmaker or arranged marriage, which is especially prevalent in India ([SOURCE](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-59530706)). So due to the difference in consumption patterns, I\u2019ll forecast America and Europe with similar trends. Whereas APAC and others follow a separate trend.   \nBut for all regions I'll assume that they follow historic trends of either meager increase or decline for the next 2 years as macro trends continue for the next 2 years, before improving for the better as macro conditions improve.\r  \n\r  \nFor America and Europe,\r  \n\r  \nTo forecast Y/Y payers, \r  \nAs the macro environment changes for the better, America and Europe Y/Y payers will get a slight increase in growth at similar levels as 2021 where economic conditions were the most favorable for the next 3 years before tapering off for the rest of my forecast.\r  \n\r  \nTo forecast Y/Y revenue/payers, \r  \nI assume that revenue/payers will get a bump as MTCH better optimize their prices either through a higher paid tier or better pricing/less discounts. Which is a direction management wants to take as stated on their Q4 2022 Earnings Conference.\r  \n\r  \nFor APAC and Others,\r  \n\r  \nI believe the explosive growth historically will not sustain as this explosive growth is a low hanging fruit, mainly people who are curious and the most willing to try dating apps. It\u2019ll take about 6 years for MTCH\u2019s products to catch on as consumers will require a cultural shift and overcome the difficulties as stated above facing this region. So from then on, MTCH could start charging a higher price.   \n\r  \nFor Indirect Revenue, opting for less granularity I forecasted it as a % of subscription revenue as the success of indirect revenue comes from how well subscription does.\r  \n\r  \nREVENUE MODEL: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/JIFQay0)\\]\r  \n\n\n# \rCOST:\n\nCOGS comes from e.g. Customer care, hosting fees & in-app purchase fees etc. Given that MTCH's cash cows e.g. tinder and hinge are mainly on the app store, this means that the largest COGS should be in app processing fees. Opting for less granularity, I\u2019ll assume that COGS will tend towards 30% of Revenue as the app store collects 30% from the sale of in app purchases. \r  \n\r  \n***Marketing,***\r  \nManagement has stated their intent to increase marketing spend, I\u2019ll assume that they have elevated marketing spend for the next 2 years. Remaining at historic levels for the next 5 years before tapering down. Management does not need to go overboard with marketing spend given that the business model of dating apps is that they spread mainly through word of mouth.\r  \n\r  \n***G&A,***\r  \nManagement has stated that they have overhired and would like to optimize margins. I'd assume G&A spend remains at a constant nominal amount for the next 2 years before the economy picks up again and the demand for dating apps rises which allows MTCH to hire more people for the next 3 years before tapering down.\r  \n\r  \n***R&D,***\r  \nI\u2019ll assume that R&D expenditure follows historic trends to avoid being overly granular.\r  \n\r  \nCOST MODEL: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/m9Db92K)\\]  \n\n\n# \r\rCAPEX and D&A:\n\nI\u2019ll assume that the company gets more capital efficient for the next 2 years, reinvesting below or near historic amounts. Before expanding its Earnings Reinvested for the next 3 years to accommodate the higher growth and tapering into capital neutral.\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\n\n# \rASSUMPTIONS:\n\n1. WACC remains constant at 11.57%, TGR is at 2.0%\r  \n2. \rChange in NWC follows historic trends as shown in this schedule \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/LfLhTzI)\\]\r  \n\r3. Churn is not a significant factor that affects growth rate.  \n\n\n# \r\r\rWACC:\n\n\r  \n***COST OF EQUITY***\r  \nRFR (1M Avg) = 3.82%\r  \nMarket Beta ([SOURCE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MTCH/)) = 1.59\r  \nEarnings Yield (1M Avg) = 3.98%\r  \nS&P 500 (1M Avg) = $4467.72\r  \nGrowth Forecast ([SOURCE](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/credit-suisse-ups-sp-500-year-end-forecast-4700-2023-07-18/#:~:text=The%20S%26P%20500%20is%20currently,company%20earnings%20and%20to%20buybacks))\r  \n4050 = (4700 x 3.98%) / (1+R) + (4700 x (1+7%)) x 3.98% / (1+R)\\^2 + (5029 x 3.98%) x (1 + 2%) / (R - 2%) / (1+R)\\^3\r  \nR = 9.12% \r  \nERP = 5.30%\r  \nCOE = 12.25%\r  \n\r  \n***COST OF DEBT***\r  \nBB bond yield (1M Avg) = 7%\r  \nMarginal Tax Rate = 21%\r  \nAT-COD = 5.53%\r  \n\r  \n***WEIGHTAGE***\r  \n\r  \nI\u2019ll assume that FY22 interest expense carries until the maturity of the relevant debt and remove the consideration of that debt from interest expense.\r  \nFY22 interest expense = 146M\r  \nMV Long Term Debt = 1313.32M\r  \n\r  \nLease Liability = 111.91M\r  \nTotal Liability = 1425.23M\r  \nAvg Price (1M Avg) = $45.65\r  \nShares O/S = 279.32M\r  \nMarket Value of Equity = 12750.96M\r  \n%Equity = 89.9%\r  \n%Liability = 10.1%\r  \nWACC = 11.57%  \n\n\n# SANITY CHECK:\n\nLooking at %Earnings Reinvested, Growth Rate and ROIC.

I don\u2019t necessarily agree with management\u2019s plans moving forward on how they plan on growing through higher marketing spend. A good dating app should mainly grow through word of mouth as it shows that churned users are satisfied with the services provided and are living proof of the effectiveness of the app. I do see higher priced tier being a viable solution especially with users who are impatient or need a bump, but the removal of introductory pricing may cause an issue as a dating app may not be worth spending a lot of money on till users can see its worth proven either through word of mouth or trying their services at a low initial commitment.  \n\n\nWorst Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/Cr3niM2)\\]\r  \nBase Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/SEj9bta)\\]  \nBest Case: \\[[INSERT](https://imgur.com/a/JxtXugt)\\]\r  \n", "id": "166bjoo", "created_utc": 1693489367.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 48, "comments": [{"body": "Match helped me bang a ton of chicks with super low effort.

And even though everyone knows that Match Groups apps exist, and they hear some succes stories every once in a while, that doesn't mean that you view it as the best option. And that is where psychology and branding comes into play.\n\nOther bull points I would like to add are the facts that the west is going through a big progressive transformation into a world where long-term relationships are becoming fewer and fewer. More and more people either wan't to stay single, be in an open relationship, or are at the very least being accepted more as being serial-monogamous.
