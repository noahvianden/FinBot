FTX gone, and now  Binance and CEO Plead Guilty to Federal Charges, so the process  continues. The main goal of all this is to have an exchange that falls  under US gov and institutions control in case the crypto assets become  part of the financial institutions portfolio offering.\n\nSo,  contrary to other bets we're all doing trying to anticipate the winner  (e.g. the next EV player, the next Cannabis stock, etc..) here we have  at least one of the unkowns cleared.\n\nNow,  fundamentally speaking, the company has the highest margins compared to  other traditional exchanges. Nothing to compare here. Just another  freaking league. At the top of its volume trade (remember COVID period  crypto frenzy) it was a machine printing cash. Literally a machine  printing cash.\n\nA lot has happened  in the crypt-sector since, but Coinbase not only remained in the game  but became the strongest player where the Blackrocks of the world would  chose it as the custodian. No second alternative. No other options.\n\nMy  concern is on the fundamental level: The trading volume growth in the  Q3 earnings report were negative and they forecasted Q4 to be flat. If  Crypto is gaining momentum again, why the volume is not picking up? It  has been trending low since the peak in 2021. In q2-2021 **$462 Bn** was traded in volume whereas in recent q3 we were at **$76 Bn.** As per management comments this is due to:\n\n* **Decline in Crypto Asset Volatility**:  Alesia Haas, CFO of Coinbase, noted that crypto asset volatility, a key  driver of their trading business, continued to decline and reached  levels not measured since 2016. Lower volatility typically results in  less trading activity, as traders often capitalize on price swings for  profit\u200b.\n* **Market Dynamics and User Behavior**:  In low volatility environments, there is generally less trading  activity from advanced users, market makers, and participants looking  for arbitrage opportunities across the ecosystem. These groups are more  active when there are significant price movements or discrepancies  across exchanges\u200b.\n* **Performance Relative to Global Spot Market**:  Despite the decline, Coinbase\u2019s trading volume decline of 17%  quarter-over-quarter was mentioned to have outperformed the global spot  market, which declined 24% quarter-over-quarter. This suggests that the  decrease in trading volume was not unique to Coinbase but was part of a  broader market trend\u200b\u200b.\n* **Changing Customer Behavior**:  There's also a mention of changing customer behaviors in their trading  practices. The blended average fee for Consumer was higher in Q3  compared to Q2, driven largely by the mix of Simple versus Advanced  Trading volume in the quarter. This implies a shift in the type of  trading activity among users, possibly moving towards simpler trading  interfaces and strategies\u200b.\n\nThe deadline (this is from an article in Financial Times)\n\n>[https://www.ft.com/content/79bd86af-4412-4b8e-ae8d-1c7674105732](https://www.ft.com/content/79bd86af-4412-4b8e-ae8d-1c7674105732)But the Securities and Exchange Commission now faces a **January 10 deadline**  to approve one or more pending applications for \u201cspot bitcoin\u201d ETFs,  which are expected to provide a cheaper way for investors to gain  bitcoin exposure.\n\nIn  a month everything will be already priced in. The market has been  taking $COIN from the range of $70sh to closing at 115$ this Friday. The  short-term play already occurred, now the longer-term optionality is on  the table. If Jan10 has a positive outcome for Coinbase, just think  that this stock IPOed in COVID bubble at 400$ range and it came down in  the very known bear market we went through to 33$. I'm not setting any  valuation here as it purely depends on volatility of the crypto market,  it could go back to 400$ depending on crypto trading cycle or back to  33$ if no ETF is approved by SEC and traders keeps themselves out of  this.\n\nThe smartest way to not let  this train go, is to buy 2024 Feb or Mar options call at the current  range, in my humble opinion.
