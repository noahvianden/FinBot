{"title": "Carvana(CVNA) business model question.", "selftext": "So I will start with why I am writing this:\n\nI need to find who is buying the Asset Backed Securities(ABS) that Carvana (CVNA) is packaging and selling.\n\nNow the long story:\n\nI sold my used car to Carvana about a year ago for roughly 18K. This was a great deal for me since I saw similar cars to mine listed at local dealerships for about the same price. Like many have said, I scratched my head and got rid of it since it also needed new tires and brakes and I knew I could not sell it to a private party for that much. Why look a gift horse in the mouth.\n\nNow, a year later, I want to get another car for my kid and have noticed that there are virtually no good private seller listings on craigslist(where I usually buy my cars from). On there, I can cut out the middle man(used car dealer) and split the savings with the seller.\n\nThe one or two sellers I found were asking far too high a price c/w a used car dealer and when I point this out they point out the fact that they can sell it for roughly that much..you guessed it..to Carvana!\n\nWhat everyone has been saying is true, Carvana is artificially inflating the used car market. This is not a question but a well known fact for 2-3 years.\n\nBut why? Used car prices are dropping fast(check inflation reports or simply CarGuru's used car price index) soooo Carvana must be freaking out right??? Time to short CVNA right???!!!!\n\nNope.\n\nThey make their money another way: Giving high interest loans to buyers with poor credit at high loan to value,LTV, (100% often) and putting all these loans together, packaging them and selling them to someone else, collecting a fee for this...\n\nSo by inflating the prices, they actually make more money b/c their side(or actually main) business has more gross volume.\n\nThe underwriters of these loans are your major players like WellsFargo and Citibank etc... but they are not the \"bagholders \". They sell these. My question is:\n\nI want to find out who actually owns the bags which is remarkably hard to do.\n\nCan anyone help?\n\nOn a side note, doesn't this sound all too familiar with housing in 2007? I am hoping there are no credit default swaps involved or I will have a heart attack ;-)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*\\*UPDATE: I think everyone should read fader-mainer comment below, he has given the best response to this and I am grateful\\*\\*\\*", "id": "17y5lpf", "created_utc": 1700311024.0, "score": 40, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 26, "comments": [{"body": "Just found an article from Bloomberg from June of this year(paywalled) it basically says the same thing without mentioning specific car sellers(just subprime loans).
