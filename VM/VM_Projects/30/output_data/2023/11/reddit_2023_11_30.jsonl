{"title": "What's the verdict on DELL's earnings tonight guys?", "selftext": "I keep this one short. Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL) is projected to release financial results for its fiscal 2024 third quarter, today after the closing bell. Analysts expect the company to post quarterly earnings at $1.46 per share, down from year-ago earnings of $2.30 per share. The company\u2019s revenue might come in the range of $22.5-$23.5 billion for the latest quarter, this is also a decrease from the year prior. However, according to seeking alpha, DELL has beaten EPS estimates 100% of the time over the last 2 years and has beaten revenue estimates 88% of the time. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 12 upward revisions and 3 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 12 upward revisions and 0 downward.\n\nDell expects both Client Solutions Group (CSG) and Infrastructure Solutions Group revenues to be roughly flat sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter. Continued sluggish IT spending by corporate and global enterprise customers is expected to have hurt top-line growth.\n\nBut wait, there's more. Dell's also getting smacked around by some nasty currency exchange rates. They're expecting a slight hit on their revenues because of this. Ouch.\n\nBut now, let's talk PCs. Demand's kinda meh right now. Gartner's spitting out some numbers saying worldwide PC shipments dipped 9% year-over-year in Q3 2023, down to about 64.279 million units. Dell's sitting in the third spot in the PC market race, behind Lenovo and HP, but hey, at least they're ahead of Apple.\n\nThis company shipped 10.32 million units, witnessing a 14.2% year-over-year decline in the third quarter of 2023, per the Gartner report. Just for comparison: Lenovo, HP and Apple shipped 16.146 million, 13.531 million and 6.266 million units, respectively.\n\nKeep in mind, DELL is expected to benefit from the generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) boom as big tech increasingly invests in it. Dell's getting a piece of that sweet AI pie, diving headfirst into this generative AI craze. Dell\u2019s expanding Generative AI solutions portfolio is expected to have accelerated top-line growth. They've got this thing called Dell Validated Design for Generative AI with NVIDIA, it offers pre-trained models that extract intelligence from data, sparing enterprises from building models from scratch.\n\nDell Validated Designs for Generative AI now supports both model tuning and inferencing. The solution is supported by the Dell PowerEdge XE9680 AI server or the Dell PowerEdge XE8640, with a choice of NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, which offers frameworks, pre-trained models and development tools, such as the NVIDIA NeMo framework and Dell software.\n\nI'm going to grab calls, because I'm expecting a turn-around in sales and them to beat expectations once again. I gotta remind you guys for those who missed out last quarter, DELL went up well over 15% with earnings. It went up the earnings prior too and the one before that. What's also great is that the cons are cheap due to lower strike prices. So I'm going to grab 12/1 77c @ 1.80. We just need the stock to go up ~4.6% to break even here. Be mindful of the bid/ask spread tho, since this is a lower-volume contract. 75 and 76c boasts higher volume, but are a bit more expensive. To make things even cheaper, you can consider a put spread. Regardless, just like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. Next week, we have NIO, AI, and CHWY.
