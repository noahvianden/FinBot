If you have just a handful of positions you don't necessary need to know how to portfolio hedge, because the other things you need to know can certainly cover it!\n2. You need to know How to use a  Covered Call.The basic Covered Call Is vital to understand for protecting your stock positions. The Covered Call is awesome in a neutral to somewhat bullish market place, but less effective in a bear market. This is where a more advance concept as a PCW comes in handy.\n3. We must understand Protective Puts. The Covered Call, and the Protective Put is all we need to know if we only have a couple of positions. Maybe up to five positions, you can probably manage the positions without draw downs to the portfolio. Just by using protected puts , and covered calls on those individual stocks!\n4. Then, for the more advanced, you can combine number 2 and 3 together to get number 4 which is the Defensive Collar! Thats how you neutralize a position!\n5.

Never done it before.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "If you don\u2019t already know, you probably don\u2019t actually want to do it.\n\nThere are two ways to do it. One is traditional short selling. To do this you start with a margin account. This will allow you to borrow shares from your Broker. Usually they have collateral requirements like you have to hold a certain percent of cash or shares in the account, from 25-50% of the value of your short position. The idea is you sell the borrowed shares, say they\u2019re $100/each today. If the value of the shares falls to $50, you buy them again at the lowered price and can pocket the $50 in profit(minus interest/fees). The risk is that the shares rise, and then your broker pretty quickly starts getting nervous and you may have to close your short position and rebuy the stock for say, $150 and pay back your broker. Or they can be entitled to liquidate your collateral if it really gets bad. Suddenly a quick bear market rally has turned you upside down. That was a pretty tame example, imagine the \u201cshort squeeze\u201d scenarios people talked about during the meme stock crazes. Citadel borrows hundreds of GME shares at $20/share betting on it becoming a penny stock. Suddenly it goes to $300. You now have to close the position and buy hundreds of shares at the higher price. The side of the meme stock stuff people don\u2019t talk about is the folks who took out margin and lost their houses or life savings(though these were mainly calls). \n\n2. Buying put options. You don\u2019t necessarily need a margin account for that. But you will need special permission from most brokers. Signing options agreements saying you know the risks, and understand what you are doing. If you only have a few grand in your account they may just deny your application or limit your permission to only do certain kinds of options. Anyway, you pay a \u201cpremium\u201d for a contract that says you have the right(but no obligation) to buy \nshares at a certain strike price. A put option would obviously be one where you bet that the price will be lower in the future. A tricky part to this is if the stock has already been volatile(say, Tesla recently), options are going to come at a pretty expensive premium. So you will need to really get it right to make a profit. I would say a small put option bet is much preferred over shorting. \n\nRiskiness: \n\n- Stocks, as a whole, tend to go up over enough time. Everyone expects 2023 to trend down, but even bear market rallies can be months-long, and there is no guarantee that it does go down. \n\n- To successfully do put options(or shorting), you need to bet on the stock going the right direction. If you get this bet wrong during the period of the contract, your options expire worthless. If the stock is particularly volatile, you may also end up paying a higher \u201cpremium\u201d for the contract. \n\n- A classic quote is that \u201cthe market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\u201d \n\n- At least with common shares of a company, you don\u2019t have as much of the timing aspect to worry about. People who\u2019ve seen Tesla fall 70% this year may still believe in it long term and can now average down. Others may have sold their shares and are holding cash, hoping to instead wait on the sidelines for cheaper shares. That is also less risky than placing an options bet.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for that.
