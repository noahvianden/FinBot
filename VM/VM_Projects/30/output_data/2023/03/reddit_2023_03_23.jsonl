That said, I haven't looked at the specific numbers.\n\nH100 is a giant chip, something like 85 gross die per wafer.  So maybe they're getting 30-40 to yield, I don't honestly know, no one does outside Nvidia or TSMC.  But lots of wafer starts for not that many chips out, and you lose a few % during packaging too.  Grace is also on the larger size, and the other GA102/104 type parts too.  Wafer demand is just growing and has to be well managed.   \n\nThere is also another key gate here which is DRAM, or HBM memories.   Generally Nvidia has been pretty good about advance orders with key suppliers, so those guys are going to have to ramp in sync.  Second order, they will also work with system suppliers to take some of the cost and ordering burden for some key components too, but there are lots of moving parts, multiple logistics teams working to bring it all together.   \n\n25-30% might be aggressive.

Just trying to recall the rumors from last year, but nvidia and AMD both were cutting some 20-40% of orders and apple cut about 10%?

I've spent time in Taiwan and information is currency there, the whole place is like a giant game a telephone.  It's also hard to know what's reliable.   \n\nIf TSMC does really have a \"below 70% utilization\" on 5nm in Q2 as reported in Jan (due to Apple and AMD pushouts) I imagine Nvidia is stepping up for a good portion of that.  Their improved demand is more of a recent phenom, catalyzed by ChatGPT -- you could hear the change in exec demeanor during Q4 call and reiterated during GTC.    Specifically on H100, this part is still ramping, so 4x from here is assured as they are still early.  And chat isn't the only use case, obviously.\n\nThe whole question here is about end user (CSP and enterprise) demand.  Layer the increasing parameters/model size, the rapidly improving utility of the models, the number of players and their facilities, the down stream ecosystem being enabled and the infrastructure needed to support -- the only thing comparable is the build out of the internet in the early 2000s.

Software companies trade at 7.2 x revenue. The best trade at 10. Let's say NVDA at 10. They need to do 65b in revenue. Right now they do 26b. \n\nHere is a few more thoughts. They are pushing into AI and gaming will fall aside as the chips they produce will be to AI. Tsm is manufacturing so it's at max cap. We know gaming has dropped substantially. They also have huge inventory build. The AI might at best replace the downfall in gaming. So at the end of the day it won't substantially increase their total revenue.\n\nHere is another nugget. Data center was growing so 50%+. Now at 11%. Data center account for 50% of rev. \n\nFinally, the premium is insane to other chips. Amd does same revenue but trades at 7-8 x rev.
