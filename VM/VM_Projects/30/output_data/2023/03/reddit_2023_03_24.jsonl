The FTC is an Executive Branch organization for the record.\n\nIn effect the FTC will no longer be able to make rulings of its own. The FTC will no longer be able to play the role of judge jury and executioner.\n\nAs it stands companies cannot appeal to the Judiciary until after they have gone through the internal \"court\" system at the FTC and yes the Executive Branch FTC has an internal judge and court system which by itself is problematic for obvious reasons. They get around this very blatant unconstitutional system by making the internal judge and court system completely pointless and meaningless but here's the thing as I said earlier companies cannot appeal to actual courts until after they've gone through the circus court. Oh but the FTC makes going through their count as tough and drawn out as possible. It's meant to be such an unbelievable waste of time and resources that companies just give up.

This would ensure you get the premium in full, but your gains would still be capped.  Hopefully you sold the CC at a price you are willing to let th stock go for.  It might not be worth locking up the capital though, depending on the return for risk profile and your trading targets (you have defined targets right... Right?)\n\n**In order to do what you asked in the post:**\n\n**You would have to call your broker to convert the cash position into a margin position. ** You could then buy the leap to cover the risk on the open short call position. You would then be running a spread ( same expiration as short call ).  You could even buy a farther dated leap against the far dated short call to convert your position to a calendar or disgonal and have more opportunity to recoup your paper losses and work to break even.\n\nI've done this several times with cash positions that I needed to convert to spreads.\n\n**Some thoughts though:**\n\n* If you are going to have the shares called above your cost basis, let it ride. If the stock tanks the calls will lose intrinsic value to match your losses on the held long positions.\n* You can buy puts to cover your downside risk if you choose to hold.\n* Why in the actual fuck would you sell far dated calls against your shares?  The premium could NOT be worth it, unless you were looking for a Vega play and could buy them back after IV crushes.  Even then, it's a silly play if you do it without hedging the delta \n* In the future, try selling 30-45DTE maximum.  That's where the options start to really decay in value due to theta ramping up.\n* I encourage you to watch your positions more closely.  And have defined risk thresholds. Be willing to take the L to save the port from bigger fatter Ls.  \n* Also never enter a trade unless you have a defined exit target/strategy.  This way, you enter objectively and remove emotion from your exit decisions.  Sure you might miss some big wins, but you will miss big losses like this one too.
