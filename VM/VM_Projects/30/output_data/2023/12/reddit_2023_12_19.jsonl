{"title": "Farfetch Sold to South Korea\u2019s Coupang", "selftext": ">New York-listed e-commerce giant Coupang plans to buy Farfetch Holdings in a deal that will provide the struggling online luxury fashion retailer with $500 million in capital to stay in operation, the companies said in a joint statement. Trading in shares of Farfetch, which has a market capitalization of $226.7 million, were halted, while those of Coupang were down 4.5% on Monday.  \n>  \n>Farfetch, an e-commerce company that has helped luxury brands sell online, has been hit by a slowdown in the industry which has complicated its efforts to make a profit on technology investments and prompted credit rating downgrades in recent weeks. Farfetch operates an online luxury marketplace selling high-end fashion and jewelry that dozens of small brands and boutiques rely on as their main selling platform. It also provides back-end technology for ecommerce for department stores and brands like Harrods and Ferragamo.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-south-koreas-coupang-buy-151417128.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-south-koreas-coupang-buy-151417128.html)\n\nWhat a massive fall for Farfetch. The company was innovative, but its debt was a red flag, and its business model was confusing. Are they trying to be the Amazon of luxury fashion or the Shopify for luxury fashion, or both? Their acquisitions were confusing, heavily taking on inventory and operating physical stores like Browns and Stadium Goods.\n\nThis is an intriguing deal for Coupang. It will be interesting to see how much they liquidate Farfetch's assets. Are they primarily focused on Farfetch Platform Solutions powering the backend of fashion e-commerce or the digital marketplace and growing that brand?\n\nIt could be a great deal for Coupang or a distraction from their core business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "18lqq4b", "created_utc": 1702952692.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 51, "comments": [{"body": "The craziest thing is that Jose Neves stays on as CEO of this company.

And most of them are very affordable, easy to repair, and have a long productive life with basic maintenance (not like, changing the battery which is half the cost of the car, when you add labor). Oil changes suddenly seem like a child's play compared to the kind of nightmares EVs end up in service for.\n2. They sell vehicles of all major categories: subcompact, compact, midsize, full-size, sports, compact SUV, midsize SUV, full-size SUV, pickup, minivans.\n3. Toyota are the worldwide top-selling brand at the moment.\n\nTesla is struggling to introduce new categories. The Semi is clearly not good to sell, they only made less than 100 in a closed program and nothing. The CyberTruck is shaping up like a dud. Can't scale the battery production, can't scale the truck production, can't sell outside the US (won't pass pedestrian safety etc.), and so on. Roadster 2 is MIA.\n\nPlus people are starting to become aware that EVs have hit a peak in terms of range and utility. For 90% of drivers, it'd take a battery revolution (safer, higher density, faster charging etc.) to consider an EV. But it's not just up to Tesla, because the electric grid can't take that many EVs at once.\n\nTo Elon's credit, I believe internally he and his colleagues are fully aware of this. This is why they keep throwing these slogans at us that Tesla is not a car company, but an energy company (powerwalls), AI company, robot company, basically anything else but a car company. Except all those are low-revenue efforts (by comparison) or pure vaporware.\n\nThe writing is on the wall for Tesla.
