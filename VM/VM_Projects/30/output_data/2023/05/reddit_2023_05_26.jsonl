We're 19 (trading) days into May, and so far, there's been 52 TA > HOD (money prices that hit ABOVE spot price HOD) for $QQQ. Although these prices <always> fill, it's not always as easy as today where you can nail a .17% move in 20 minutes. QQQ has always been the golden child of money prices (in terms of time-taken-to-fill). There are absolutely circumstances (if money price > ATH, 52wk low, or shows BIG % move > .35%) where 'filling' a money price, doesn't happen within the hour, day, or week. Another example being today where QQQ hit $338.86 -- from Monday (after having sold off almost -1.75% from that point), or SPY hitting lows -2% since last Friday after seeing $422.69. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDate     Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description\n\n05/22 | QQQ | 15:59:00 | 337.64 | 0.41 | \\*BULL.TA\\_HOD | $ PRICE ($338.86) TA > HOD (338.67)      \n\nor \n\n05/19 | SPY | 10:29:00 | 420.59 | 0.1 | \\*BULL.TA\\_HOD | $ PRICE ($422.69) TA > HOD (420.72)   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are 2 golden rules to money prices. 1.

Over the past 4 years, I can count on 1 hand the # of times I've seen it take > 1 month for something to fill, so 2022 has really made me speculate whether those types of instances could be tied to option expiration? Quarterlies? Just straight up unusual/extreme instances? I wish I knew, but I don't. Regardless, I've been doing this long enough to understand just how near & dear money prices are to the market. Even if time is a negating factor, it doesn't stand in the way for long. That being said, lets get to the kicker.\n\nIn June of 2022, a $340.21 money price hit for $SPY. Nearly -7%. Again, I'm floored seeing one that extreme. F\\*\\*\\* outside THE REALM of extreme. \n\n   Date           Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description\n\n06/22/2022 | SPY | 09:34:00 | 369.83 | -0.18  | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($369.77) TB < LOD (369.8)\n\n06/22/2022| SPY | 15:03:00 | 365.82 | -1.27 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($340.21) TB < LOD (364.08)  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe're now, 1 month away to the 1 year mark of seeing that. Not only did SPY (unlike $QQQ) NOT fill that extreme 52wk low, but we're +11% since, and 17% away from $340.21. Maybe, just MAYBE................. maybe, that has to be a gimmick? MAYBE? For the first time EVER? Because if THAT was a gimmick, maybe this one is too? \n\n&#x200B;\n\n   Date           Ticker      Time         Price     %ChgO      Event                               Description\n\n12/14/2022 | QQQ | 14:01:00 | 288.79 | 0.25 | \\*BEAR.TB\\_LOD | $ PRICE ($249.77) TB < LOD (287.28) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNobody calls for a 1987 type crash. Even if they did - they'd be crazy. I'd call them crazy. Am I calling for a 1987 type crash? No. I'm just saying, it's not off the table. It's not off the table at all. As of right now, $SPY has $422.69 to fill, & $QQQ has $341.42. The market will go higher (I'm edumucated guessing + hoping) those get touched so our T's get crossed & our i's dotted. There's no crash flashy enough that isn't warranted for SPY + QQQ to break the lows we made late last year.

{"title": "Getting strong AMD vibes from SPCE", "selftext": "Anyone remember AMD back in 2012-2015? I remember buying in when it was about $3 (a whole $50 at the time) and following it as earnings came in and the company was on a positive track but the stock kept going down. The upsides with Crypto, Machine Learning, and other processing power heavy technologies just around the corner yet the stock continued to be barely hanging on to life, then  suddenly the stock took off as it began to show the earnings reported weren't temporary but long-term strategic growths.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now I'm looking at SPCE with similar vibes, here's why.\n\nJust a few years ago Space Tourism was predicted to be a growing and potential multi-billion dollar per year industry.\n\nHere's some charts because we all like pictures.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2i7wr1a1z82b1.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=679365ac2cb3e72a57686b9ca1a3ca1dc6f74436\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xn0d0p42z82b1.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&s=f47c70490f6a8526b0d29c62b044048519ef109f\n\nBut why SPCE? Why not AMZN or SpaceX?\n\nIt all comes down to: Affordability, Availability, and Astronaut-ability.\n\n# Affordability:\n\n* Virgin Galactic Ticket Price: **$450,000** (Target market: Millionaires)\n* Blue Origin Ticket Price: **$1,250,000** (Target market: Multi-millionaires)\n* SpaceX Ticket Price: **$55,000,000** (Target market: Governments & Billionaires)\n\n# Availability:\n\n* Virgin Galactic Yearly Capacity: 400 Flights (planned) / 2,400 Persons\n* Blue Origin Yearly Capacity: 52 Flights (estimate) / 312 Persons\n* SpaceX Yearly Capacity: 61 Flights (proven) / 427 Persons\n\n# Astronaut-ability:\n\n* Virgin Galactic flights qualify for the commercial astronaut recognition by the FAA\n* Blue Origin flights qualify for the commercial astronaut recognition by the FAA\n* SpaceX flights qualify for the commercial astronaut recognition by the FAA\n\nThat's right, they all qualify! The FUD over the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line is pure marketing by Blue Origin and SpaceX as well as SPCE bears. The FAA recognizes commercial astronauts (tourists) **who fly to a height of 50 miles or higher.** (see below)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cjf86qh3z82b1.png?width=978&format=png&auto=webp&s=5359188837bfc2b46e008f2033ef40cc26092c09\n\nLink: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial\\_astronaut#:\\~:text=The%20FAA's%20Commercial%20Astronaut%20Wings,an%20FAA%2FAST%20licensed%20mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_astronaut#:~:text=The%20FAA's%20Commercial%20Astronaut%20Wings,an%20FAA%2FAST%20licensed%20mission).\n\nSo in summary it's the millionaire version of the Lady & Lord established title thing, except it's real.\n\nWhy go to school for 6 years and be a Doctor if you could add \"astronaut\" to the end of everything for the same amount of money? If someone is willing to throw out millions on a yacht slightly larger than their peers, why won't they drop the money on a spaceflight?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat all brings me back to why the stock is tanking, they just had a successful test flight of their new craft and the stock is down 15% today. Maybe it's \"priced in\" but my guess is that the FUD is getting laid on thick since it is becoming likely that SPCE will be a serious market competitor, potentially taking sales away from Blue Origin or SpaceX, but the reality is that the market is so much larger than current  capacity ([https://www.valuepenguin.com/travel/americans-space-travel](https://www.valuepenguin.com/travel/americans-space-travel)) and it will take decades to saturate that market. Virgin Galactic is the only relatively affordable spaceflight option right now and if it goes away, space tourism will be a thing only accessible by the ultra-wealthy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: I like the stock, but I'm probably regarded, so that's why I like it. Or maybe I've had too much caffeine today. This is not financial advice, this is the dumpster behind a wendys.\n\nPS: I wish I could flair this \"shallow dive\" as I'm not that smart on stocks, I still own the stock that must not be named\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50.", "id": "13siib1", "created_utc": 1685120143.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.73, "num_comments": 30, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|338|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vv5kyt/elon_will_still_buy_twitter_but_not_the_way_you/) \n**Account Age**|10 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\nHey /u/DRKMSTR, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: I like the stock", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Give me a second, it's on my phone, see replies to this comment for the rest.

The market decided it wanted to pullback and test 410 support first, however, with our first closure over 420 since August 19th I believe this bull run is just getting started. \n\nLooking back I was one day too early on Wednesday with my swing calls\u2026 shoulda done 3-7dte like I had considered before. \n\n**EVENTS**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qjawr42f292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee706112fd47e230332bf345e5b7c83e6d1c38c6\n\nFirst of if you didn\u2019t know\u2026 the markets are all closed Monday! \n\nWe have 4 fed speakers spread out through the week next week. And we also have a ton of heavy hitting data Wednesday through Friday. The most important one that I am waiting is JOLTS Wednesday, non farm Thursday and unemployment rate Friday. \n\n**MAKE IT MAKE SENSE** \n\nIf you remember post the last two FOMCs JPOW basically said we are not going to stop rate hiking and that will we will not see any rate cuts in 2023\u2026 What did markets do? Markets priced in a bunch of rate cuts by EOY (100bps cuts at one point but for the most part it was 75bps) and that sent the markets absolutely rallying\u2026\n\nNow look at this\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8zz3tzxf292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1915a87c88ce0e33e3abeec1f45b63dd03f4f5f3\n\nIn the last week the markets have went from a 17.4% odds of a 25bps rate HIKE at the June meeting to now a 71.1% chance of a rate hike\u2026 yet what happened this week? We rallied..\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4skx0yeg292b1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b28d29b66e7ad7358ccaa8dff7e499ef1d8b4c1\n\nNow not only that\u2026 but the markets went from just one week ago today pricing in a 44.7% odds of 75bps rate CUTS by end of year to now pricing in 39.4% odds (the highest odds) that we do not see any rate cuts by end of year\u2026\n\nNow I know markets can be a bit wacky\u2026 but how does it make sense that the markets went from expecting a fed pause and 75bps of rate CUTS by end of year to now expecting 25bps of rate HIKES next meeting and NO CUTS in one week and that week closes green on SPY?\n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ioj7hwug292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3250c8bbe738867307da4ea8748187b34c138e5c\n\nOn the Daily we officially established a new demand (support) at 414.55. As I suspected if we pushed higher we would indeed make a new demand. The daily DMI is now waving higher and we have a new demand with bullish weekly support\u2026 the upside is what I would be looking for here and there is no real sense in shorting SPY right now. \n\nWe also closed over 418.78 and 419.5 supply\u2026 this means until we put a new supply in and we would need two red days back to back to do that our target remains the 429.68 area I pointed out last Friday. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6em1p7gh292b1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=155909c08b914e3abd026cea4f27a773444517c3\n\nOn a weekly time frame here the bears actually put up a REALLY big fight and until today the weekly was going to make a new supply and at one point we attempted to set up a closure below the weekly 411.46 demand. Nonetheless though bulls pushed us and we now sit over the 416.09 weekly supply after retesting support of the 411.46 demand. The weekly DMI continues to wave up and we also continue to push higher with no new weekly supply\u2026\n\nOur target remains 427.35 and in the chance we blow through that roof I have no major supply level until 453.23. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqc4yjvh292b1.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c7d31115d23b67d38dd0a1297777eb8666cd780\n\nAs you can see from the daily here we once action have made a new lower rising wedge support (this has been a theme for a while now). We also had a very nice v bottom off of 410.53 and we have for the first time since August closed over 419.5 resistance. Its not pictured here but this orange channel has a upper resistance of 427.5. As of right now that is the bulls target. \n\nWe will keep a close eye on that red rising wedge though as this resistance could still with 3 touches hold as resistance into next week. \n\n**SPY WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/szf7dm9i292b1.png?width=952&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8e0c99459fb2d6dc67ff385d6cdf420eb851e85\n\nAs you can see we are in a bigger blue rising wedge that days back to September and we are also in more of a short term black/ blue rising wedge.\n\nThis blue rising wedge resistance is all the way up at 434.27 for next week and shows a clear path to 430-440 by end of June. The black rising wedge resistance sits at 425.4 for next week. The way this weekly candle with the very long wick bounce off the weekly 8ema is makes me believe in continuation to the upside for next week. \n\nSPY Weekly levels   \n Supply- 416.1 -> 427.4  \n Demand- 411.5 -> 381.7  \n Support- 418.6 -> 411.6 -> 407.7  \n Resistance- 422 -> 427.4 -> 431.9\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yqa402pi292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c58185164cedea8e936dea9b1dc7b6be16abe1b\n\nOn the daily chart here for futures we did have one demand left at 4198 and we officially with establishing a new demand (support) at that critical 4156 area actually have just opened the door to the upside in a big way. \n\nWith a daily closure over 4208/4216 supply our next logical upside target is 4311. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q7n40l6j292b1.png?width=669&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a3ead6fd61597ef7efdc9b05a6958744ae798a1\n\nFutures weekly is the same story as spy\u2026 we attempted to put in a new weekly supply and we also attempted to lose 4130 demand for a while. However as it would be the bulls bounced us right off 4130 demand and now have closed us over 4193 supply. With this move up and the weekly DMI moving up along with no new weekly supply\u2026 our favoritism here would be to test 4284 and if we break through that the next major level is all the way up at 4540. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3esl1cnj292b1.png?width=918&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5eb4129d8ee1d3a12e1daee437df7a3a9a857f3\n\nLooking at the daily here on futures we are currently sitting in our 4075 to 4310 channel. Being that we are pushing up that leaves our upside target as 4310. Our rising wedge structure on futures is much different than SPY when we come to resistance but the same support wise. Currently the red rising wedge resistance sits at 4235 for Monday. \n\n**FUTURES WEEKLY PRICE ACTION** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u69lzi3k292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d068dd9de9b785bab540ba00f025bd90b794021b\n\nOn the weekly here you can see that we have the same structure as SPY weekly with the blue rising wedge that slightly bigger followed by the black one. We are now sitting in this 4280 to 4135 channel. Being that we back test the weekly 8ema and 4135 support and was able to hold that shows that we are still bullish here. The black resistance sits at 4243 and the blue rising wedge sits at 4268 for next week. \n\nOne interesting thing I follow is the JPM collar 7/ 11 week movement. As I said is that usually week 7 to 11 reverses\u2026 however, in the chance that the trend does not reverse (which appears to be what is happening right now) then we usually actually see that trend continue even more aggressively. That would mean a potential 3 long bull run could be starting here. \n\nThat would mean our target is 4300 which is the current JPM collars calls. \n\nFutures Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 4193 -> 4284  \n Demand- 4130 -> 3920  \n Support- 4184 -> 4132 -> 4075  \n Resistance- 4230 -> 4283 -> 4328\n\n**QQQ DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zq4mlrmk292b1.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=80b8aa2662a3a2ece03e20421bd175fa7762d33b\n\nLooking at QQQ daily here we absolutely have rocketed since we put in that 331.35 demand. We now are starting to knock on the door of that 351.57 demand now. \n\nIf this momentum continues which daily DMI and extreme bull momentum says it should we then should start to looked 351.57 demand -> 357.09 supply and finally the ultimate target of 361.7 demand. \n\nHowever, if we were to retrace at all we should find some major support at the 336.37 to 337.6. \n\n**QQQ WEEKLY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/008lc44l292b1.png?width=934&format=png&auto=webp&s=1133bcbb0929103ea8a6c3304e13510b96334f1f\n\nFrom the weekly stand point here this charts actually is just insane its pretty much just vertical for the last 2 months now. \n\nThe bears once again were not able to put in a new weekly supply and the DMI remains waving up with extreme bull momentum. The weekly 8ema which will be around 330.67 next week should once again be considered strong support. \n\nAs of right now the target remains 361.85 and if we happen to go on that 3 week bull run or a blow off top my target is 382.9/ 384.54 demands.\n\nQQQ Weekly Levels  \n Supply- 361.85 -> 330.67 -> 318.64 -> 306.06  \n Demand- 384.54 -> 382.9 -> 322.47 -> 318.18\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3583bykl292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d8d1f5b6d23b6604dd2eb79277b201879a0e1d0\n\nNow here on the VIX we also put a new carrot top in\u2026 the one really interesting thing to me here is the fact that the VIX dumped pretty aggressively all morning and we saw almost -10% at one point and I thought we were going to approach the 16.92 support area\u2026 however, what happened that was very interesting is that the VIX actually continued to rise today even though SPY was rising. \n\nThere was a lot of oddities about today trading but the biggest one remains that from pretty much 1130 until EOD the VIX continued to hold flat and then began to rise\u2026 however, SPY also began to rise. It definitely is a phenomenon that doesn\u2019t occur often and makes trading hard. \n\nThe VIX closed at 17.95 just under that critical 17.97 support. I will be watching Tuesday to see if the VIX continues to sell off or not. \n\nThe VIX most certainly was reacting (the market) to the fact that a debt ceiling agreement has NOT been reached and as far as I know they are about to go to recess and will not be back in session until Tuesday. Which means according to Yellen if we run out on the 1st that they will have essentially two full days (Tuesday and Wednesday) to come to an agreement\u2026 \n\n**DXY/ 10YR YIELD** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1eemhb0m292b1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=6806a17d393e89d6db3160e317d81437bc31f9f1\n\nNow I follow the 10yr and DXY every day but I don\u2019t really talk about it every day\u2026 but I do find it very interesting that DXY and 10YR both are in the exact same bull channel since the 2nd week of May. \n\nWhat I also find interesting is that DXY and 10YR daily look like a massive cup and handle which means DXY should hit 105.13 to 105.63 again and 10YR should hit 4.011% to 4.049% again. \n\nWhat really is odd about this is the fact that the last time DXY was at this level was March 13th to March 17th, February 16th to February 23rd, and December 13th to January 6th. \n\nSpy traded (at close) 385.36 to 389.99, 408.28 to 400.66 and 401.97 to 388.08 during those time periods for an average SPY closing price of 395.67. That means with our closure at 420.02 SPY is trading 6.1% higher than it was when DXY has traded at these levels in the past or about $25. \n\nThe last time the 10YR was at these levels was March 10th, February 10th to 15th, January 3rd to 5th and December 23rd. During those time periods SPY traded at close at 385.91, 408.04 to 413.98, 380.82 to 379.38 and 382.91. For an average at close trade price of 389.98 which is about $30 higher than current close or 7.7% higher. \n\nWhat does that mean? Well it could mean everything or it could mean nothing\u2026 I just find it interesting that over the last 6 months when the 10YR and DXY have been at these levels historically SPY has been trading much much lower. It also is very odd to watch the 10YR and DYX continue to rise each day as SPY and TECH continues to rise\u2026 \n\nThis all feels very much like something is going to break and its going to break in a big big way\u2026 the question is just when. \n\n**WEEKLY TRADING LOG**\n\nToday was another tough day of trading for me and I ended up closing out a small red day. The last month or so now I have found it extremely difficult for me to remain profitable on Thursday and Fridays. I seem to be in this cycle of absolutely killing it on Monday through Wednesday and then struggling like crazy on Thursday/ Friday. \n\nHonestly for me it all comes down to my strategy. My strategy as I have mentioned relies on the technicals of the market. I do not share my full strat but some things I look at and put a ton of weigh in is momentum, DMI, VOLD and VIX. The hardest part about these explosive rallies we have had lately is the fact that those metrics are not aligning. The other hard part is that there is times where after the huge run up where the technicals will point to a perfect put entry\u2026 of course I take that and the issue is that the techncials immediately cycle but little to no movement is ever had. \n\nThe other issue is that it seems like lately premiums at least the last two days for sure have completely lagged moves. I know this morning I played two puts and a call. None of those seemed despite winning on all three to pay any decent reward. I had a few mid day plays too some I closed small wins/ loss and others I stopped that for the size of the move that happened the premium did not reward us very much at all\u2026 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4i7l73jm292b1.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=f501a90c088cce95ec496bf13f71b44b820d22c9\n\nI actually did close out my most profitable week of the year again and this is now my 8th green week ibn a row making it my longest win streak of 2023 and my 2nd longest of the last 2 years. \n\nOne interesting this is that this is also my 2nd lowest weekly win rate of 2023. I had a great beginning of the week but lately as I have said I struggled to close. \n\nI have a really nice 3 day weekend again and I have a few things I would like to back test and I have the time to do it. I have one more indicator I use and have on my charts all day as I trade but I don\u2019t necessarily use it on every entry\u2026 I am considering if its time to put more weight into it\u2026 but I will not be able to do that until I back test\u2026 \n\nI hope you guys all have a great weekend and for any of you who have had a someone you know whether a friend or family member serve and lost their lives defending our country\u2026 I truly thank you for your sacrifice.
