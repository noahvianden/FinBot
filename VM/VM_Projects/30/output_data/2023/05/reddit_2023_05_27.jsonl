I did this to reduce my single company tech exposure. The second position I closed this week my one of my MSFT Call Credit Spreads for a 171% loss. I did this because I didn\u2019t see the position recovering and I wanted to cut my losses. I left my other MSFT Call Credit Spread in place because I am already at my effective max loss so there was no reason to close it. I can only gain or remain flat from here. The last position I closed were my 3 F Cash Secured Puts for a small 9.4% gain. I am still bullish on F but I want to wait until after the debt ceiling debate is resolved.\n* The only position I opened this week was my QQQ Iron Condor. It went immediately against me the next day, but I\u2019ll let it play out for a while.\n* Next week I\u2019ll be closing at least two positions, my MSFT Call Credit Spread and my XOP Iron Condor.\n* These past two weeks have been brutal to my strategy, but I am not deterred; however, I do plan on changing up my tickers. I\u2019m going to try to do more ETFs rather than single company tickers. I have both made and lost very large sums of money in the past which is why I am trying out a new strategy with a small portfolio while doing my best to remain transparent to this community.\n* I don\u2019t think much will happen with the debt ceiling; the politicians will figure it out. There is simply too much at stake. I wouldn\u2019t bet 100% of my portfolio on that idea, but that\u2019s just my two cents. June is historically the 3rd worst month of the year on average for the stock market (3rd after SEP and AUG), not that it means much for next month but I am also expecting the FED to raise rates again in June. The market has not priced this in, but I don\u2019t see how the FED won\u2019t raise rates. The economy is still too strong, and inflation is still not in check.\n* And to all you who had NVDA and AMD this week, congratulations. Your gain was my loss, as I got burned by MSFT, ORCL, and CRM as a result.", "id": "13thwls", "created_utc": 1685220782.0, "score": 117, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "Hey bud thanks for the update, you have a good win rate but you are letting your losses ride too much (in your credit spreads), I'd suggest transforming them to ironflys once the short strike + premium is breached and have a GTC order at the ironflys cost basis.\n\nThis should limit your loss to -100% or breakeven if you are lucky...\n\nYou don't have to be right all the time, just enough to have a positive win rate...

{"title": "Get bullish when everyone else is getting bearish.", "selftext": "Market sentiment is the overall attitude of investors or traders in a given financial asset or class. The sentiment can be calculated in many different ways. These range from mathematical formulas based on how many people are speculating on a specific security to industry-wide surveys. Everyone has access to simple tools like technical analysis tools that attempt to quantify precisely this.\n\nIt is never perfect because bubbles can always get bigger, and fear often only reflects how many participants are involved. Think of how many buyers there would be for farmland post-nuclear war. While an extreme example, it is a good reminder that things can always get worse.\n\nToday's market sentiment is terrible, especially in specific assets like energy and agriculture commodities. There is a lot of weather risk in the near term. You can use google trends for searches such as \u201crecession\u201d or \u201cdebt-ceiling\u201d to see how everyone searches for the same fear-driven terms.\n\nHistorically, these are the best times to buy. Intuitively, this is easily understood. When everyone else buys homes, it is an excellent time to sell. Buyers drive home prices, not sellers.\n\nIt is easy to say this. It is hard to do in practice. Yet, if everyone did this, the sentiment indicators would not work, and everyone would be rich. So it is especially important to remember when fear takes over, it is almost guaranteed people will eat, drive, and continue living their lives.\n\nIt almost always pays to be buying when others are scared. History suggests this is one of those times.
