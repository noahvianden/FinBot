However, the consolidation and extreme chop came today. Today managed to only put in a full $1.96 of range on SPY or about 40% of the 10day average range\u2026 Futures only put in a 23.5 points of total movement on futures which is 43% of the 10 day average\u2026 to say today was a tight range is an understatement. \n\nWe also closed today at 47mil volume (that will probably rise to about 55-60mil by 8pm but this would make it one of the lowest volume days of the year\u2026. The current lowest of 2023 is April 19th which was a 55mil volume day. \n\nThe market despite what it tried to lead on last week clearly is a little on edge for CPI on Wednesday. \n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f0ki6u4s3oya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=47f5823b388c0647eef26984c4bf21ddaea8d7df\n\nWe currently find ourselves trading just over the middle of this 405 to 415 channel. We are slowly creeping our way up to that 415.56 and 417.03 supply (resistance). Right now after we established demand at 405.06 last week the trend still is the upside and until a new supply (Resistance) is put in I would be looking for further upside. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a6wxc9ns3oya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e42c32366badaa408c1afe792411ecc49ac7173\n\nWe closed out yet another doji candle. This time though one could even argue this is a hanging man candle. Which would signal a short term top. However, we with only an 11 cent higher close than Friday its tough to say where this trend wants to go. \n\nThe bulls did come down and test the daily 8ema and reconfirm it as support. I had plans to EOD Tuesday open some longer DTE puts on SPY\u2026 I was looking and hoping to be able to enter closer to 415-417\u2026 I was tempted to enter those today but knowing the unpredictability of SPY I decided to wait till tomorrow. \n\nWith the VIX at 17 two days till CPI and SPY coming in on key 415.6 to 417 supplies/ resistance I like my risk to reward for puts\u2026 think about it not even looking at the numbers on CPI\u2026 is the risk to the downside or the upside? Currently the risk is to the downside. \n\nFun fact we still have 4 daily gaps on Spy\u2026 396.49-398.68, 401.6-401.76, 407.77-407.27 and 407.27- 408.64.\n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 415.6 -> 417  \n Demand- 405 -> 404.3  \n Support- 408.9 -> 407.9 -> 407 -> 405.2  \n Resistance- 414.9 -> 415.6 -> 416.8\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/309dba4t3oya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5c71783dc4edefe66a95246edbf22dd6f7603cc\n\nCurrently futures also finds itself in this 4074 to 4190 chop zone\u2026 this 4150 has been a real magnet in the markets\u2026\n\nWith the demand being made on Friday we favor a push back to 4190 or a new supply (resistance) being established. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lr05iit3oya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=401a10931d1b2471d53ed73fe0452abaea3b87af\n\nNow when we look at the daily candle here on futures the bulls were able to avoid the true 4150 double top/ doji which woulda made me feel 100% confident in over night puts\u2026 but this makes it a little more indecisive. Futures daily still has about 45 minutes till close so I will watch for that close. \n\nRealistically with the daily 8ema being taken back and the 8ema holding as support here one would have to favor the bullish case on futures as well\u2026\n\nHonestly until after CPI on Wednesday we are likely to see some chop in this 4150 to 4190 range. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4190 -> 4198  \n Demand- 4074  \n Support- 4150 ->4110 -> 4095  \n Resistance- 4180 -> 4191 -> 4199\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zo9ymbzt3oya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=468ddabfd2c1d9675d3575bb6e997c74f33ee26c\n\nNow the VIX1D here is holding a nice downward trend. Now we are still in the early stages of learning VIX1D but im am watching closely still\u2026 one thing that I do note here is that we are now coming into that 8.49 support area which is where we double bottomed before. \n\nThere is still a VIX1D gap at 14.55 to 14.71 too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zutuxteu3oya1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cdb14c042fa59340c891888467b60ae9b4df483\n\nNow on the VIX here it actually for a little bit of time had me convinced of it not closing red\u2026 actually for most of the day the VIX held about a 50 cent range.\n\nThere has been a lot of disconnect in the VIX and markets but lately I have got to say its correlated pretty well\u2026 Favoritism would be to the downside on the VIX which is the upside on spy. \n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lbymjeuu3oya1.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=091ec55e8381fbcb5bf0bd95a61a1d8a4b4d2e01\n\nToday was a really rough trading day. That extremely tight range we had today was just trap after trap. In my trading I use technicals a lot for entries and exits and today was not a technical based day.
