I wanted to beat the Spy and VOO lines that Robinhood started posting though. Immediately ended up down. I paid off a wedding ring and transferred 6500 into my IRA. Maxed that out in VOO. But Netflix crushed me. Slowly lost a few 100 a day at best. Ended up down close to 5k on Netflix 12/15 with a 400 strike.
