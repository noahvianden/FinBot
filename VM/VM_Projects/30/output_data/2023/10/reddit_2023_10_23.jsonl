Higher gamma is typically *bad* for neutral credit plays, like Iron Condors. Credit plays typically count on selling *higher IV* in the hope it falls lower within a few days after the event.\n\nThe expiration decision is a trade-off. The closer the expiration is to the event, the higher theta has to be to drive extrinsic value to zero by expiration, and the more impact a constant decline in IV will have, since there is less extrinsic value to start with. The further you go out, the less impact theta and vega have in your favor, but the higher the initial credit (extrinsic value) will be.

In terms of cumulative theta decay, yes, that is true. But that is countered by more time for the underlying price to hit and exceed a profit target. And buyers generally believe that the benefit of more time outweighs the negatives of more time. After all, you can't lose more than the initial extrinsic value to theta decay, while the upside gain is unlimited (for a call).\n\n> I think maybe you mean it in reference to my specific question on this specific earnings strategy. If I'm playing primarily IV crush, I should want to play that game quickly, right?\n\nI wouldn't necessarily say that, no. Ideally, you maximize the favorable change in IV, like sell at the peak and buy back at the trough. Where those points fall in time will vary from situation to situation.\n\nFor example, there is nothing preventing IV from increasing AFTER an earnings report. If there is a big surprise to the downside and hints of more negative surprises to come, IV could explode after the ER.\n\n> The intent is to enter them with positive expectancy and boost the returns of my core strategy.\n\nThe first part is spot on (although [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/14kdijb/what_you_can_expect/) is a good cautionary tale about how positive expectancy doesn't mean you can't go broke).

Scaling up is sometimes necessary in order to make the reward worth the risk. For example, consider a very low-risk option trade that pays $.69/share. So the max profit quantity 1 can pay is $69, which is not a lot of money to get excited about, right? Even if it is an 85% win rate trade, who cares? A win buys me one B-tier video game.\n\nLeverage is the other reason to scale up. It's a similar reason, but leverage is more about dollars than win-rate. If I have a trade where I can risk $100 to win $6900, that's exciting. Why not do quantity 420 of those and make more money? Nevermind that the win rate is 3% ...\n\n> How do those guys with lots of capital know that it's safe to buy like 10 or 20 plus contracts at a time?\n\nThose guys aren't interested in \"safe\". They want the opposite, more risk for more reward. Using one or both of the reasons listed above.\n\n> And how do they get in at the price point they want when they're buying so many contracts? Wouldn't they at some point start turning the market against themselves or am I way overestimating how the effect of such a large trade and 10plus contracts at a time is actually quite normal for such high-volume traded stocks?\n\nProbably 80/20 overestimating/underestimating. It depends on the dollar volume of the contract. If it's ATM SPY monthlies, a 10 contract trade is not going to move the needle on the market and you can see trades of that size and bigger cross the tape on a daily basis. But for odd-ball POG LEAPS calls that have 0 volume for most of the year, a 10 contract trade could very well move the market. A little.\n\nKeep in mind that for most contracts, the nominal share volume in contracts is a fraction of the daily share volume of trading on the stock market. I did a calculation for AAPL calls once, and the nominal total single day share volume represented by **all** calls traded on AAPL, not just one expiration or strike but all of them, was about 1/10th the AAPL shares traded on the stock exchange the same day. And that was *not* adjusted for delta, that was just assuming 1 call represented 100 shares of volume, so 1/10th is the *upper limit* of the fraction of share volume. So a guy filling a 69 quantity order on just one strike/expiration of AAPL calls isn't going to be more than a drop in the bucket vs. what's changing hands in the stock market.\n\nI used to routinely trade quantity 20 Iron Condors, so that's 80 contracts total, since an IC has 4 contracts per spread.

Or from the pov of the seller, the premium the seller demands to compensate them for the risk of covering the expected move, should the contract be exercised.

The probe comes weeks after founder Terry Gou announced his bid for Taiwan\u2019s presidency and stressed that he won\u2019t be pressured by Beijing, despite his extensive business operations in the country. While it is unclear whether the investigations are connected to Gou\u2019s entrance into the presidential race, analysts said the move will send jitters through foreign businesses in China. On Sunday, the state-owned Global Times reported that tax authorities had recently audited Foxconn\u2019s key subsidiaries in the provinces of Guangdong and Jiangsu, where it has major factories. The natural resources ministry had also investigated the company\u2019s use of land in Henan and Hubei provinces, it reported, citing anonymous sources. Foxconn said in statement sent to CNN that complying with the law was one of its \u201cbasic principles.\u201d \u201cWe will actively cooperate with the relevant units on the related work and operations,\u201d it added. Foxconn, also known as Hon Hai Precision Industry, has iPhone factories in Guangdong and Henan, including the world\u2019s largest in the city of Zhengzhou.\n\nThe company\u2019s listed unit in Shanghai, Foxconn Industrial Internet, plummeted by its daily limit of 10% on Monday. Parent firm Foxconn Technology, which is listed in Taipei, fell more than 2%. The probe was revealed after Chinese police reportedly raided the Shanghai office of international advertising agency GroupM, owned by WPP, as Beijing ratcheted up pressure on foreign businesses. Foxconn is one of the world\u2019s largest contract manufacturers. It makes everything from smartphones to electrical vehicles for clients including Apple, but doesn\u2019t sell anything under its own brand.

Xi Jinping truly is an Elon Musk level moron. Imagine if Xi had just had the CCP keep China's head down and nose to the grind instead of constantly threatening and intimidating neighboring countries, constantly stealing technology with spies and hacking, and requiring foreign companies to give up a lot of intellectual property in order to build factories there.  China could have pretended they weren't a threat to global security for 20 more years until it was even harder for other countries to not rely on China, and Chinese chip processors would be fully caught up to Taiwanese and Western processor manufacturing.  The vast amount of electric cars in the world would be built in China.  Now China has set itself back quite a bit, just as their population demographics are destabilizing, and property values ready to implode.  And ironically the main reason that Chinese citizens only invested in property all these decades instead of the Chinese stock market is because the populace didn't trust the Chinese stock market because the people knew the CCP could threaten, break apart, or delist any company at any time for political reasons.  So the populace had to make do with something more tangible but it's just created an enormous bubble that even the powerful CCP can't delay popping forever as the population declines.", "score": 37, "replies": [{"body": "What ifs are what ifs\n\nChina in 2013 was an extremely corrupt nation with volatile politics threatening to tear it apart. \n\nThe primary heir to Hu Jintao then had his son crash in a Ferrari and kill multiple people in Beijing, after which that heir tried hiding his son.
