{"title": "The rare TRIPLE EARNINGS PLAY - $1k > $10k this week guaranteed", "selftext": "Once in a lifetime, when the stars align correctly, there comes an opportunity for what some have called \"The Retards Solar Eclipse\". What am I referring to? The rare TRIPLE EARNINGS WEEK. Ladies and gentlemen, let me show you a guaranteed $1k>$10k play this week that as safe as going all in with deuce seven off suite. \n\nThis week, there are three earnings plays that I believe will all crush. Disagree? Fine I dont care. But dont downvote me until I'm red you retards. Until then follow me to Valhalla. \n\nI will be starting with $1k slightly OTM calls. Going all on Chegg calls first thing in the morning. Chegg will run up all day, then destroy earnings just like they have the past two times because any retard can see this is the perfect scenario for them.\n\nThe next day, I will be taking my gains (probably about 2.3k)  and putting it in UPWK calls slightly OTM. They went off this past eanings and will continue to. With everything moving to work from home and so many unemployed, their platform will flourish and they are still way off of their ATH. \n\nFinally, Wednesday I will put my now 5k of gains into WIX. Wix will destroy just like they did last time, because their platform is fantastic and easy for retards like you and me. They have been growing and with more businesses seeing the need for online platforms, they will go to the moon. This will leave me Friday with about 10k of gains on the rare triple earnings play.\n\n\nOnce I get this right and call my shot, I would like my flair to be \"The Babe Ruth of WSB\". \n\nThank you and enjoy the tendies.\n\nEdit 1: so it appears the run up was obviously pricing in great earnings. Lol. Gonna be tough for CHEGG (and UPWK for that matter) to go up after ER after such hard run ups. With that being said, I got in early enough on Chegg that even if it goes red this morning, I'll probably still just about break even because it gained so much yesterday. Whatever I have left I'll be pumping right into UPWK. I'll be selling pretty early this morning to change positions, as I do expect UPWK to have an early pump that I want to catch.\n\nEdit 2: I sold my Chegg position for only a 35% loss this morning and then immediately bought $640 worth of UPWK $17c for 8/21. So I'm behind but I can still make it up with a huge beat from Upwork lol. Obviously with these run ups, if I was playing with big money, i would for sure be pulling out EOD. But YOLO here we go with attempt #2 on UPWK!", "id": "i23b2k", "created_utc": 1596329443.0, "score": 476, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 280, "comments": [{"body": "So basically, you're gonna get calls on all the hyped remote work or school tech.

Look at what happened with Vine. I feel that in order for a social media platform to continue in the long run, it has to actively contribute in some way to society. People love content sure but the reason Facebook is such a powerhouse is it’s more than just an app to share things and talk to people nowadays.

Millennials back then were seen the same way as gen z now. Shit, every new generation that is in their teens- early twenties is considered the same exact way: no attention span and move on quickly to the next hot thing. \n\nThis wasn’t an argument between fb and tik tok. It’s an argument between Instagram before fb and tik tok now. Before FB bought out Instagram, instagram was basically the “tik tok” at the time and FB was the “Instagram” at the time. Facebook evolved into an advertising tool that small-large business use and less of a social media app, and Instagram was pushed as its main social media posting platform \n\nWhile vine and tik tok share many similarities in terms of their platform, the main difference is the sheer exposure and media attention tik tok has gained that vine never reached before. This in of itself attracts more sponsors and more advertisers. \n\nTik tok can easily transition into what Instagram does now. They really don’t need to revolutionize what they are doing. I think it’s unfair to say that this platform is just the next hot thing that attracts younger audiences  and will phase out in the short term (of course I agree that longevity is an issue now because of the banning issue.

It means basically that the market, chiefly big 💰 / institutions are expecting a future outcome ( or probability of one) and have allocated money appropriately. Historically Fixed Income due to its relative size has been a fairly reliable indicator. Previous crashes this year such as Feb/March crash and the mini NQ/SPY crash in June and July were both foreshadowed by major/ high Vol shifts downwards in 10 year bond prices .\n\nCurrently 10 year are plumbing new lows at the bottom end of 0.50 percent ( discounting the March flash crash ). This coupled with the meteoric rise in GLD and SLV last night IS NOT A GOOD SIGN. The sharp changes occured directly after stimulus news. \n\nWhat this means is that Institutions are signalling a chance the package will not be passed on time or in its entirety . \n\nBUT BUT VIX IS DOWN AND EQUITIES ARE UPPIES!\nyes little autismo, they are but that doesn't mean what you think it does. it's a poorly kept secret that this market is being kept afloat by hedge funds , institutional buying and retail fomo. I don't have the crayons or time to explain it to you but just look at news releases, support level buying and virus/ trade talks pumps. Vix being low doesn't necessarily mean what you think it does either. To oversimplify VIX goes up when more people buy puts. This is typically done to hedge against market drops. \nBig players don't need to hedge if they SOLD all/ most of their equity holdings and moved it into Bonds/ Gold / Foreign equity. Hedge funds are also notorious for shorting VIX as part of the 'Fed Put \" trade . The fact that FI/PM are up while VIX is down makes me more certain of a drop not less as it means Big boys are trying to pass as many bags as they can to retail without spooking them.\n\n2. There's been a lot of articles on this already so I'll keep it short, you all know how to use Google. SPY since March lows has been split in two like a sociopathic Solomon. There is the big 5 tech and everything else. Currently Big 5 is sitting at 25 percent of all market cap with huge returns over the last few months. This coupled with the performance differential of the other 495 has surpassed levels not seen since the dot com boom. THIS IS NOT SIGN OF A HEALTHY BULL MARKET. Major Bifurcation is the second best signifier of a 🐻 after the technical 20 percent drop level ( which doesn't really mean much) . 🍏 Has now become the largest company in the world surpassing Saudi Aramco. THIS TECH BOOM IS NOT SUSTAINABLE. Most of the apple gains have been from a one of WFH structural shift and Fiscal stimulus ( that now accounts for 25 percent of all disposable income ). If the stimulus bill doesn't pass, Apple is fucked. Just look at the AAPL gains from the last week, do you think this is sustainable?\n\nThe common retort on this sub is, \" we all know it's a bubble but it will pop in few months, I'm getting my TENDIES while they're hot! \"\n\nThis sentiment has been thrown around for months all through April to July. Well what if months later is now? What better catalyst for a bubble pop than a Stimulus not going through as planned? \n\n3. There's been a lot of posts about DXY dying and a lot of it is half true. Currencies are a hard thing to predict but I do want to point out two very key factors that are bullish for DXY. \n3a- The entire world, especially emerging markets rely on Dollar inflows from exports to fund imports for key goods, especially commodities (oil etc). Global trade fell off a cliff in March and has barely recovered so where are countries getting dollars? By buying bonds . This was the reason behind the DXY spike to over 100 in March and the reason why the FX central bank swap program was instituted by JPOW. So unless you see global trade rebounding strongly in the very near term ( pigs will fly ) bonds will continue to be bid extremely strongly at auction, supporting DXY. \n\n3b) DXY as has been pointed out is primarily dropping due to Euro strength ( which makes up about 65 percent of the Index). When DXY is compared to the Bloomberg trade weighted dollar index you'll see it hasn't dropped far at all and this makes sense (see 3a above). The Euro bullish trend, along with AUD/USD,GBP/USD and JPY/USD is unlikely to continue much further. Foreign central banks and governments for that matter will not allow the dollar to crater. We've already seen rumblings from the EU and JPY on this front as exports are already in a tenuous position. The last thing foreign companies need is a strong currency to hamper export sales. So I wouldn't bet against the FED, but I sure as shit wouldn't be getting against the ECB.\n\nSummary: I don't see this stimulus playing out on time or in full. Big money is pricing in either a delay or being scaled back substantially to meet Republican demands. I won't go into the specifics of the political theatre because quite frankly it doesn't matter. PM/ BONDS are are all the signalling device you need.\n\nHow I see this playing out: The stimulus bill will pass on few weeks after a substantial Rug pull, similar to the 2008 TARP fiasco. I would strongly recommend either holding cash or going long DXY while this plays out. Either buy the dip on GLD/SLV with leaps or go long TLT at like 180c.\n\nPositions : short MNQ 3 units at 10530 and 1 ES at 3220.

The market stabilized that summer in hopes of it passing, and when it didn't in September SPY dropped from like 125 to 90 - yikes! The rate of decline slowed once TARP was passed, and things turned around that winter.\n\nThe only issue with comparing today to TARP is the failure of TARP passing corresponded very closely with the Lehman brothers closing their doors. So everyone was jacked to the fucking tits on fear, and then TARP was delayed an epic rug pull followed. This was peak fear over a true financial collapse of the world's financial system.\n\nSo, I agree with you and I don't agree with you. I think a pull back will happen, but I don't think it will be significant enough to call it a rug pull. Maybe a 3-5% pull back max. Enough to make the new traders a little salty, but give us old folks a few chuckles. Peak fear and uncertainty passed in March for our current situation. The next hurdle to deal with is inflation once all this money that has been printed starts to circulate. Cash will not be king, and you had better find some assets to get your cash in to preserve your buying power.\n\nWith respect to your analysis of big tech and the comparison to the dot com bubble, that is blatantly false through and through. Big tech has the balance sheets to back up their valuations today. Because of covid, everyone flocked to them in droves to provide the technology and communication necessary to keep their businesses open. Amazon with a nation wide grocery delivery service ... I mean come on! Sure the PE ratios have inflated a little, but we aren't talking Yahoo at at a PE of 2500 in 1999. The rest of the economy will catch up once the gears start grinding, and this will happen in the fall after phase 3 vaccine data becomes available and a sense of future personal safety becomes more certain. \n\nIn terms of the dollar and swaps... I think you are completely correct in your analysis, but ignoring the effect of printing so much money. The dollar comes down to supply and demand and we are massively pumping up the supply right now, which means no matter how hard other governments try, the dollar is going to fall. As a side, since it's inception, the Euro was designed to be the world's financial standard, so of course the Euro is poised to look stronger than the dollar because they want to take the dollars place on the podium. This was the case in 08 too. The difference is once your currency is the world standard, it is your job to provide liquidity through swaps to prop up foreign central banks, and thus you are not only printing for yourself but you are also printing for others. All this is to say, the US dollar will continue to fall sharply as the economy starts running again and this huge glut of dollars floods the market. \n\nI do not think, however, the dollar is at risk of being replaced though. The euro sucks and the entire EU cannot take the place of the US economy or financial influence. The liquidity swaps and other burdens the US shoulders to keep foreign markets afloat ensures the dollar will remain the dominant currency into the next recession.\n\nFUUUUCK me I had a lot to say.

Thank you for your time, puddud4\n\nThen CC every dealer within an hour and a half to start a bidding war to the bottom", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Here's how you negotiate buying a used car from a guy that used to be a car salesman.  \n\nFirst, find the car on their website, but DO NOT fill out the \"enter your name and phone number for 200 off\" coupon pop-up thing.  \nIf you do, you'll automatically be put in the system for the internet sales guys.  Those guys move a lot of cars each month and aren't willing to budge as much as a walk up guy trying to hit a bonus. \n\nIf they use a digital camera to take the photos and there is a time stamp on it, take note of how long the car has been on their lot.  The longer the car sits, the more willing they will be to move it.  If they just got it, its probably not their lowest price yet.  Usually a big dealership wants to move their cars as fast as possible, but won't sit on a car for more than 60 or 90 days.  \n\nGet the vin number off of the website if possible (ill explain later).  It also helps to find a similar vehicle from their competition at a similar price point.  I bought a toyota tundra, but there was a Ford dealership (owned by a different company) next door.   They had a very similar F-150 for a few k less.  The different company is key, even if its a different brand (ford/toyota).  I worked at a Ford dealership with a dodge/ram/jeep dealership next door.  If you walked away from me and bought a ram next door, I still got half of your commission and didn't have to deal with your bullshit.\n This is why you don't fill out the internet thing, the sales guy has to split the commission with the internet guy.  You need to tell them upfront you DIDN'T fill that out.  Bring it up casually in conversation like, \"hey I didn't fill out the coupon thing online, I can do it now from my phone if you want.\"\n\nAnyway, \n\nThe price they have the car marked on the lot will be significantly higher than the internet (theyre competing with every dealership online).   They'll try to say thats a different car blah blah.   pull out the paperwork with the vin and compare it. the vin is stamped to the dash on the inside the windshield on the driver's side, so you can  call them on their bullshit standing next to the car.  The salesman will play dumb, but feel free to call them out for lying.  \n\n\nGet a pre-approval offer from your bank or capital one or whatever.   Get approved on the actual vehicle with the vin number, enter in your parameters (number of months, down payment, trade etc).  You can exaggerate the value of your trade just a bit $1,500-$2k.  Don't be stupid, you're not going to be able to make up $10k.  \n\nWhen you sit down, they're going to bring you some bullshit number (1st pencil).  Make a joke, tell them they made a mistake, you're only buying 1 car.   Give them the sheet that shows your bank approved you at the price they have listed online, on that vehicle (vin number) and tell them you'll finance through them if they can beat the price, if not, you just need the cash price and you'll deal with your bank.  They likely won't be able to actually beat the price bc you lied about your trade, and you'll probably have to give a little ground, but thats OK.\n\nChances are, they'll come back 2-3 times with numbers higher than you are already approved for. Theyll try to throw in an extended warranty, free car washes etc.  Deny any and every extra the salesman tries to sell you and get the bottom price from him. (I'll explain later). \n\n You still have the other vehicle you're already approved on at the other dealership as a trump card. If the salesman is being a dick or not playing ball, call the other dealership, either when he walks off or just conspicuously walk past the sales desk and ask them if they have the car in stock.  Tell the dealership you're already pre-approved can you come buy that car *right now*.  The dealership will 100% of the time say yes, even if they already sold that car (yeah, they're all fuckin liars).  \n\nIf they still won't budge, tell them you're tired of playing games. You're buying a car today, if they won't work a deal, pull out the sheet and say this dealership is ready to sell me this car right now and you already called them.  If they're willing to let you walk at this point and you're way off, they can't and/or aren't willing to make the deal.   \n\n\nNow remember, you lied about the price of your trade in.  Its highly likely they won't be able to get you to exactly the price you quoted yourself.  Depending on credit and interest rate and term, every $1000 financed is roughly $15-$30.  If you lied by 2k and you're pre-approved at $405/month and they're offering you $430/month, that's a pretty good deal.  If they offer you a range of between $430-$450 cross out the 450, circle the 430 and sign it saying you'll buy it right now at 430.  They'll agree.  \n\nThe bottom line,Get the lowest price they're willing to give you from the salesman.   Don't add any bells and whistles, just get the lowest price. \n\nIf you DO want to purchase the extended warranty, or the free car washes (scam) or the whatever just wait.   \n\nAfter you're done with the sales guy, you'll go in the finance office.   The finance people have the ability to manipulate the interest rate to lower your prices (which the salesman/sales managers either don't or wont).  \n\nThe dealership will get you approved at a rate (your buy rate) but won't tell you what that is.  If, for example,, they get you approved at 1.9% and charge you 3.9%, they make the other 2% on the back end.  This is dealer profit and is a part of the finance guys commission. They almost always try to squeeze 2% unless they're offering a promo interest rate to move a certain car.  \n\nThe finance guy makes a nut off of all of the packages the car salesman can't sell, and that extended warranty is likely a bigger commission to him than the back end interest.   \nObviously at this point, the news has spread from the sales manager that you're a tough cookie.  Here you can use his ego to your advantage.  He'll REALLY want to rub it in everyone's face that he is a really Badass salesman. \n He is the only one that can/will manipulate the interest rate,  so he can lower your interest rate to keep your payments close.  The end result is you can get a $3k package added for $15-20 bucks /month that the salesman could only offer you for $50-60/month.  \n\n\nNow, this whole process is designed at getting you the best price possible.  You're going to have to be willing to be a dick and stand up and walk out if they're not playing the game, but it's A LOT easier to pull off if you come in cool, calm and collected and act like you don't give a fuck.  If you come in aggressive, being an aasshole, and you're a tough sell, they won't be as likely to play the game and they'll tell you to fuck off.  Don't go in guns blazing.  \nYou've done your homework and have a couple of cards up your sleeve. \n\n\nTheir job is to get you to fall in love with the car to justify over paying for it.  Don't fall into their trap.  \nHertz is liquidating 180,000 cars before December 31st.  The used car market is going to be FLOODED over the next 6-8 months.  The auctions are going to be overflowing and dealerships with cash will be getting flooded with great deals.   Theyre going to TRY to sell them at the regular price at first, but if they can't move them, they'll be dropping prices (as they can't send them to auction). \n\nA few months from now will be a really good time to buy a used car. \nIf the prices of used cars drop, its going to hurt new car sales, so the manufacturers will likely be throwing around incentives left and right.  \nIf demand slows AND supply increases (hertz) it will be a perfect storm.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Nice.

When I was looking to buy last year, the cheapest EV was 30k and it was so small - I ended up getting a nicer used ICE in that price range. \n\nTo even compete with the cost of ICEs, costs for EVs would have to be cut in half, and this is when EV margins are already razor thin. While it may be eventually possible, it's not going to happen any time soon\n\nFor the charging network, I said exp**a**nsive, not exp**e**nsive. Meaning that if my EV is losing charge, there's not many places I can go to conveniently to charge it. Sure major cities in the US might have great networks, but what about more rural ones? Or other countries that don't have the infrastructure necessary?\n\nTrue and demonstrable autonomous driving has only been achieved by Tesla so far. That's one company. I'm sure companies like cruise and waymo will come out with great stuff soon. But even then, regulations aren't going to be changed overnight. There will be a lot of legislation that needs to written to even ALLOW automated driving. And inevitably, when the first fatal autonomous driving accident happens, this will push it back that much more", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Okay I see what you're saying.

A lot of people don't need more than 2 seats in their car and this price would be compelling for such people. \n\nAlso I just read through Biden's climate plan and two things that he plans to do are funding a national EV charging station and reinstating federal tax credits to help lower the cost of EVs for middle class people. It might take a while for EVs to be affordable for every car owner, but at least we're seeing sequential improvements. \n\n------------\n\nAs for autonomy: hopefully tesla is about to prove that their autonomous driving is significantly safer than human driving (which it is supposed to be) and regulators will be forced to approve them.

They certainly should not.  And I am not particularly concerned about the heirs who are getting something for nothing.  The estate/death tax is just a limit on how much someone can get for nothing.  For things like businesses and farms, this form of estate transfer should encourage elderly land and business owners to transition their businesses to their families earlier rather than later and model the transition as legitimate transaction where the family member takes on the true cost of acquiring the business rather than being given something for nothing. When an heir gets something for nothing it is unfair to the business competitors and actually harms the market by giving others a leg up.  This is very common in farming communities.  An ambitious, creative upstart goes bankrupt because he/she had to take out loans for property and those farms get gobbled up by multiple million acre conglomerates created by family wealth.  \n\n\"The poor rural farmer\" has been the strawman for an eternity as it relates to the estate/death tax.  A poor rural farmer that has a $10M estate is not a poor rural farmer. \n\nFor businesses, the solution would be for the estate owner to be able to pay taxes in the form of shares, shares that the heirs can purchase back if it makes sense for them to do so.

Most likely, to offset any losses that might be made but this also means you offset gains.\n\nSo, I'd tell them, if you wanted to lower your losses of your portfolio why not just invest in the top 3 and hold the rest in cash?  \n\nAlso conviction of your selection also comes into play, your number one is your number one for a reason. \n\nI've been investing for over 10 years.  My first stock was ATVI at $13 a share.  I didn't have much money and worked for basically minimum wage my whole adult life until these past 2 years, I own a restaurant now.\n\nThe only reason I sold any stock was because there was another stock that I thought would produce more gains.  Or if I liked another stock, I simply bought some of that rather than putting more into the one I was already in.\n\nI consistently bought more stock dispersed or stacked based on my conviction.  ATVI  at 13 a share was when I first started that.  Netflix at 70, amazon at 350.  Amazon was my biggest conviction buy.  I sold atvi and split into netflix and amazon probably around 20/80 ratio.  I always bought amazon close to its all time high.  350, 400, 600, 800, 900, 1200, etc.  \n\nI've always known tesla existed, but was always just a small player that didn't draw mass market attention.  Middle of June this year, I noticed Tesla, and with some extra cash I bought in and did heavy research for about a week.  \n\nI invest based on risk/reward of gains.  Tesla in my opinion is a company that has massive growth potential because of the innovation that hasn't been realized yet.

One plan would toughen listing standards on U.S. stock exchanges for what the administration calls non-cooperating jurisdictions (NCJs). But this really targets China as other countries have agreements with the PCAOB.\n\nFor Chinese companies—such as tech giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu, Inc.—that want to continue with their listing or want to initiate listing on a U.S. exchange, the PCAOB must have access to audit work papers of the principal audit firm. Companies that cannot grant access because of government restrictions can satisfy this standard by providing a co-audit from an accounting firm “with comparable resources and experience” that the PCAOB determined can conduct proper exams.\n\nThe new listing standard gives a transition period until January 1, 2022, for already listed companies. The new standards will be immediately applied to new listings after rulemakings become effective.\n\nDetails of the recommendations are in a July 24, 2020, report drafted by the President’s Working Group (PWG) on Financial Markets. PWG is chaired by Treasury Secretary Mnuchin, and he made the report public on August 6. This responds to a June 4 memorandum by President Trump directing the PWG to come up with plans to address the problem.\n\n\n\n[Thomson Reuters Tax & Accounting  ](https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/trump-administration-seeks-to-delist-u-s-listed-chinese-companies-for-blocking-audit-inspections/)\n\n-I just saw this right now, just to add to the conversation.

To your comment about 10nm being competitive to 7nm. it’s not out yet. You’re making speculative observations about a product whereas AMD has already begun releasing real products. There is also the issue of heat that intel has been increasingly having in the 10th gen line of processors. [laptop review of one model](https://youtu.be/6x8SAAk_J4c) shows that current intel offerings require more heat dissipation in the mobile lineup which could be spent towards gaming performance or productivity workloads with an AMD processor. The mobile lineup is far more accessible and practical for most buyers. If you do a simple VRIO analysis, AMD and Intel both fufill VRI but only AMD has the organization to make use of their offerings. intel has been stuck making the same processor and lack real development. Even the factory they have is just a liability due to their inability to produce sufficient yields and is considering outsourcing. Which will cost even more to get all the value chain up and running. \n\nAMD is selling increasingly more to businesses and consumers and Intel has made no meaningful steps to come back. AMD’s stock value has shot up because investors believe, with reasonable evidence, that for the next few years, AMD WILL be able to provide improvements to the product and their value to their customers that their products will provide value whether it is in production times, heat, overclocking support, or in-socket upgradability.\n\nIn conclusion, I just put an order for a stock of AMD.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Your youtube link reviews intel i7-10750H, which is a 14nm chip.

Even though Intel CPU only has 4 cores (vs 8 cores in AMD CPU), it is only 6-17% slower than AMD CPU for multi-threaded workloads. So that's why I think the upcoming 10nm Tiger Lake can still compete with AMD 7nm CPU if it is priced competitively. When more benchmarks come out, I believe people will realize that Intel 7nm delay is not a big deal because its 10nm CPU can still seriously compete.

As e-commerce takes over, those stores are more of a liability.  The physical locations are at a premium,  the stores are not designed to fill orders quickly when scaling up.  \n\nDistribution centers are designed differently and also located differently. \n\nIf an area needs 1000 of item A, it’s better to put them in a single warehouse a day or two within the area.  Not spread it over 10 stores and have redundancy delivery crews and the logistics associated with that.  Any single store may not have the space to store those 1000 items.  \n\nPeople will return items at whatever store they want and that’s also a logistic nightmare. \n\nSeller on Amazon has a very strict agreement with Amazon to the standard to repackage and resell and yet there are still a lot of variations on that.   \n\nI don’t see how Wal-Mart with its workforce can do a better job.  Keep in mind people who order items out of convenience are usually better off than those who visit the stores.  Their standards are higher.\n\nWMT stock will go up but saying that it's going to compete with Amazon is reaching a little too far.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "10 miles is 16.09 km", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Target is far better priced and valued than Walmart is.

Like you can spend $200-$500 on a single day shopping on Amazon. Compared to the $30-$50 you might spend on groceries for the week from Walmart.\n\nThen beyond that, Walmart's shopping website is stuck in 2004. The main reason Amazon is so successful is that the website is extremely well designed, and all it takes are a couple clicks to buy stuff. It's exactly why something like Onlyfans is massively popular now. Ease of access is the most important thing.

Communism is the end goal of Socialism and can be described as a moneyless, classless, stateless society. This end goal will take a long time to reach and requires many societal changes. If you do the research you'll see that essentially all existing and past Socialist states exist in countries that were plagued by feudal, Capitalist or imperial control, and the workers of these countries decided to overthrow their oppressors. Generally these revolutions are always viewed from a negative stance in the west, but you must understand that this is due to the Western perspective being directly influenced by their need for the continued subjugation of these states.

This term means a task that can be split for parallel computation practically infinitely (not really infinitely, but as far as to utilize all discrete compute units).\n\nFor example a rendering engine, where every single pixel on your screen can be computed independently is \"embarrassingly parallel\". Because you can split it off to 2 million+ independent machines for every pixel you have.\n\nOf course, it's more practical to gather significant compute power in one place, with one set of APIs, so it's convenient to use. Supercomputers also have high-speed interconnect to facilitate quick exchange of data between units. But it can also be split up, it doesn't matter much for the vast majority of tasks you run, especially if they're so theoretically large, that they exceed an entire supercomputer (which most tasks don't).\n\nA super computer is inherently parallel. It's not just one super-fast serial execution core. The languages used for utilizing super-computers focus on vector and array processing, which is parallel processing, not serial.\n\nYou can split such workloads across different networks and supercomputers, but usually you don't have to because it's not as if any particular task takes up THE ENTIRE SUPERCOMPUTER.

In my eyes, the future is completely unpredictable. Who knows if Apple or Tesla will still be here in 20-40 years. The real risk to me is not being in the market right now. I am willing to gain more over a longer period of time more slowly at the expense of losing money in the short term (which will probably happen. Yes, the point of investing is to make money - i agree. It really depends on your own financial situation... \n\nI am only 19 but have around $10k in ETFs and stocks as of now. So to me personally, I decided that investing in companies that I personally can see sticking around in the future. I would much rather pay a steeper price to be involved for a short margin of gain, than to not be in it at all. I like Tesla and Apple specifically, because the future is in energy and technology. Tesla  is, if not already, the dominant brand within it's own sector and have a clear vision of what they want to bring within the next couple years. You can watch podcasts online and hear some if you are interested. I especially like them because they aren't just a car company. It's interest in space and renewable energy is intriguing to me. Apple on the other hand is not going anywhere soon. Competition is still there, but think about all the people you know who own at least one of it's products. Apple consistently produces the best technologies and I can not see them going away anytime soon. I think the company needs to improve its marketing, because I haven't seen an effective Apple ad or billboard in years. I think many people might say they have become so big that they don't need help advertising anymore, but I think some people are becoming aware of that, therefore losing some humane feeling of knowing that they will continue to purchase Apple products without knowing what is new from the previous product.\n\nAs an example, I recently bought an iPhone 11, but I had done no prior research on the key differences between the iPhone 10 (my previous phone) compared to the iPhone 11. I had an upgrade through my carrier, but to me, there was no significant marketing skill to make me think why I should be getting the iPhone 11 compared to any other Apple product or Samsung, Android, etc. \n\nThe biggest takeaway is that I am willing to pay whatever now than later because my financial situation has provided an opportunity for me to invest the money I currently have earned and saved and put them into a worthy investment that will hopefully reap the benefits in 10-20 years. \n\nSuper long rant, but I hope that helps you or at least gives you some insight.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I promised I wasn't going to respond to responses but I have to ask - you keep talking about the future - what about big food companies?

There will always be a need for telecom and computer chips as this day in age is moving towards a more tech-reliant society. Everyone has a phone. Everyone has access to a computer via public library, friends, family, etc. \n\nAll of these industries you could argue will be stable over time. IMO the food industry is the only one where I don't personally invest in, I haven't considered looking into Indexes or ETFs however. \n\nI also can see your point - why would someone buy TSLA when it just increased 10x? Everyone hears \"buy low, sell high.\" The future is unpredictable. I can very well be wrong and maybe some of these industires might take a hit or soar. However, again, I rather BE in the market than regretting not to be in the market at all. It also really depends on your financial situtation. I am only 19 years old. I have quite some time to accumulate gains/losses over the next 10-15 years. I'm not saying that you need to be younger to invest in these companies in particular, but for me personally, I have the TIME to wait. I am also very hopeful for what these two companies can bring to the table in the \"future.\" I've done my own research (however that isn't justifiable) and believe that these companies can really innovate and change how humans will percieve the world down the road. Who knows, in 20 years from now we might chuckle that TSLA was at that ridiculously low price 20 years ago in 2020.

How about buying some puts? The puts have the effect that even if a stock price falls, some guy will be forced to buy 100 of them at a given price, pulling the share price back up. It even works with bankrupt companies, as long as you have put options, you're guaranteed to make money as long as the stock goes down.\n\nAs a consequence, the prices start to go back up. What do you do now? You won't buy puts anymore because it's obvious the market is in recovery mode, so maybe just buy some stocks now that there's been a 50% discount. Perhaps buy a few calls too. [On June 8th CBOE](https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=market_indicators:put_call_ratio) had the largest discrepancy in its history between the number of puts and calls traded, it was at 0.37 meaning there were 3 times as many calls traded as puts. If there are so many calls, it must mean the market is doing great, right? So many people can't be wrong, right? This reinforces the sentiment, causing people to buy more and more.\n\nThen there was a correction in mid June where all you had to do is buy a couple puts and you could make a lot of money.\n\nMy point is, there were *many* people waiting for this crash to happen. They all studied 2008 and knew what to do if it happens again. Because of the wide array of instruments available they can profit no matter which direction the market takes. Couple that with lots of free time due to canceled vacations, no sports events, some extra money that we have since we're not spending it since we can't... and it seems understandable why the market is not crashing.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Buy gold on dips.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The terms \"Melt up\" and \"Irrational Exuberance\" apply here.

And also a reason for dogs being domesticated is because wolves figured out that living with humans could get them food and stuff, and thats how slowly the relationship between humans and dogs started, not because people started to steal wolves from their parents and raise them. And the only reason i brought up castration is because you said these animals were endangered. The fact that you steal an endangered animal from his mom and castrate him wont help their endangeredness at all. The reason cats and dogs get castrated also has lots to do with there being way too much of them, dog and cat asylums are full with cats and dogs that cant find homes already, so the reason they get castrated works AGAINST your “endangered animals” arguement. Also cats and dogs dont need to get abused to get trained, look up how people train lions and bears in circuses and tell me its just the same as having a fucking cat. they beat them with whips my dude. And again yeah they have been born in captivity, or st least they were stolen from their parents and are raised in captivity, but the whole point is to NOT raise them in captivity.

The bear doesnt know luxury my dude, sure he has food and water but they get that in the wild easily. He probably wouodnt choose a captive life over a wild one if he had the choice, while cats and dogs do. I dont hold cats and dogs on a higher pedestal its just a different case. The only way to ever really have a pet bear is by stealing him from his parents and raising him in captivity, and even then a lot of bears attack there owners. Cats and dogs that are born in the wild and struggled their whole life are happy as fuck when they finaly get an owner after being found by some asylum. Its litterally not compareable.
