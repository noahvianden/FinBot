{"title": "Why BNGO will be your bingo ticket to the üöÄ", "selftext": "Bionano Geonomics (BNGO)\n\n\nLet‚Äôs start with cathie wood at Ark. She has already stated that genomics will be the future in terms of tech development. ARKG is heavily invested into PACB which is BNGO‚Äôs competitor. \n\nBNGO recently released that their product Saphyr is now 30%ish more efficient than PACB‚Äôs product.\n\nPACB‚Äôs market cap is 4.9B\n\nBNGO current market cap as of this writing trading at 6.58 which leaves them at 1B market cap.\n\nAssume similar price trajectory to PACB‚Äôs market puts this at 4.9x of its current share valuation. Which puts this around $32.00/share!!\n\nBNGO is waiting on FDA approval right now which could be further catalyst and reason for Cathie to enter. \n\nBNGO got an extension of nasdaq delisting by 6months a few weeks ago which at this point no longer matters. (This means BNGO needs to trade above $1.00 consistently for 10 trading days to meet compliance) \n\nI recommend buying now. Load up. Anywhere between 2-5 is sexy. I expect a small dip\n\nMy current positions: 500shares averaged at 2.73$/share\n\nMy strategy is to sell a quarter of my position at $10 and let the rest ride long term. If this dips anywhere below 3 again, I am adding more to my shares\n\nFirst DD so do your own research! Tbh, I‚Äôve never felt more confident about this. \n\nEDIT 1: This is posted after the run up to fit the market cap requirement of 1B that this sub requires prior to posting or auto removal. \n\nEDIT 2: I am being told in the comments that PACB is actually complimentary to BNGO's technology. This makes me even more bullish & likely that Cathy would invest in this game changing tech. \n\nEDIT 3: A team member from ARKG (Cathie's fund for Genomics investing) has already contacted BNGO via Twitter. \n\nEDIT 4: Previous TESLA EXEC (Christopher Stewart) joined BNGO as CFO - news reported Aug 2020\n\nTLDR: buy BNGO before you miss the boat.\n\nTo the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄ", "id": "kqfsy5", "created_utc": 1609788392.0, "score": 209, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 233, "comments": [{"body": "Up 1000% in the last month ?

Ammunition manufacturing is extremely difficult because your primers need to go \"bang\" every single time no matter what, and then the rest of the round needs to go \"bang\" in the correct way without blowing up the gun or causing a squib (which will blow up the gun on the next round fired). Liability is high, and the manufacturing process itself has to be ultra precise. And you've got different tooling and dies for every single caliber, and there are a FUCKLOAD of different calibers; then you've got different ammo grades and the different bullet weights and types and it all just spirals out of control.\n\nSetting up a new factory is very expensive, not just because of that but because you're dealing with insane amounts of hazardous chemicals you're using to manufacture explosives, some of which are of the \"you drop it and you no longer exist\" variety, and that's the kind you have to stuff into a little brass cup that will reliably go \"bang\" when it gets hit hard enough but will net you a mere $0.04/ea. Could Remington or Federal build a new factory? Absolutely. They spend 2 years on it, and then Biden bans online ammo sales and they're now moving product at a third of the rate they were before and the factory is useless (not to mention that with no new wars, there's far less military demand for ammo - thanks DRUMPF). \n\nNumerous gun companies have been killed outright by the whims of the politicians in charge at the time, and it's not even intuitive how it plays out - stonks might go down if there are democrats in charge, but companies nearly died outright after Trump was elected because everyone had stocked up under Obama and there was no wave of panic buying; then COVID happened and everything spiked to record highs and they can't churn out guns fast enough. I walked into my friendly local AK store a few weeks after the panic hit; they didn't have a single handgun left and everything on the walls under $1.5k, collectible or not, had been sold.

The same thing would work with puts on the way down (I did this with PLTR during the gamma squeeze).\n\nYour original position has a given delta, a greek that defines how an option's price moves. Delta rises and falls as the stock price moves closer or further from the strike. Here's a fake TSLA FD example:\n\nTSLA is trading at $850, so you scroll to the top of the call list and decide to start with a TSLA $1200C 1/15 for $1 per share. It's got a delta of 0.015 (1.5%) and you don't mind losing $100 to theta gang for some willy wonka and the chocolate factory type thrills.\n\nTSLA moves to $900. The delta means that for every dollar increase, the call goes up $0.015, so for a $50 increase the call is now worth $1.75, right? Not quite, there's another greek at play. Gamma defines how much the delta moves when the price moves, and it's your best friend because it makes this strategy possible. Gamma on this FD is hella low at 0.0003, but TSLA moves literal boatloads so this $50 move it pushes the delta from 0.0015 to 0.003. The option is probably worth about $230 (pricing equations are complex, I'm lazy, have a rough estimate), and you've more than doubled the original $100 investment.\n\nSo you sell the call, buy a new one with a 0.0015 delta for $100 and walk away with a new maximum downside risk of profiting $30.

Right now, and why people are happy buying at any level/thinking they‚Äôll see a ridiculously high and quick return is because of a speculated short squeeze. \n\nWhy do people think a short squeeze is on the horizon? Because the shorters have been far too over confident in their plays to the point that they‚Äôve created a pretty dangerous situation for themselves. That being that far too many naked short positions have been created on the stock, to the point that they have been running out of shares to borrow to create new positions (so they can‚Äôt force the SP down either to try get themselves out of this predicament). So as soon as they‚Äôre called upon to close their positions they‚Äôll be forced to buy whatever they can on market. And this is where the other side comes in with everyone telling each other to sell at a much higher price. Since for as long as there is still a shorter that needs to close their position but has yet to do so, they‚Äôll need to buy whatever is available to them. So if no one is willing to sell their shares but only at $100‚Äôs above current price then bad luck but the shorters will need to pay. After that point it will inevitably fall right back down, as legitimate investors (those that are long on the stock) aren‚Äôt going to buy at crazy high levels, maybe some traders might but fuck that would be risky as hell. Although you probably will see some mom & pop retail investors get burnt if they get FOMO and aren‚Äôt aware of what‚Äôs actually going on.  \n\nNow this isn‚Äôt a risk free strategy by any means (so as always don‚Äôt put in more than you‚Äôre comfortable losing). Some big risks here are things like assuming the shorters haven‚Äôt been closing positions along the ride up (though from how many shares were shorted there would still be lots still waiting to be closed), or if the company decides to issue a whole bunch of shares (if I owned shares I‚Äôd be contacting the CEO and board and seeing if they have any thoughts about raising at current levels, they obviously won‚Äôt tell you exactly but you might be able to gauge what their sentiment is, in addition to reading over past announcements and seeing how many shares have been previously voted for placement - basically whether they need to request a vote or not on issuing a certain amount of shares), or if people paper hands and sell off well before the squeeze, or if a squeeze does occur whether you‚Äôre able to get your sell in before shorts have been closed (for instance how much of the stock is owned by people that aren‚Äôt on wsb or might not even realise what‚Äôs going on). For the first issue (shorters already closing their positions) I doubt it‚Äôs been done yet, since one thing (aside from there being too many) that‚Äôs kind of still telling is you still have them talking shit and trying to encourage behaviours that would work in their favour (Andrew Left was telling people if they want to save GME to not buy the stock but rather go buy from the store itself, while that would help GME it would also help the shorters as they only care where the SP is at). Whereas if they‚Äôve had to close and have realised a massive loss we‚Äôd probably expect to see them to start complaining that it‚Äôs unfair/this was manipulation or maybe even dishing out some lawsuits. \n\nAlso as a side note there‚Äôs been talk about a gamma squeeze too, which we may have had/may still have some more legway.

I can easily \"leverage\" 50:1 in the sense that I can sell options where I have $100 collateral, but with the potential to lose $5,000.  That only requires a margin account.  And the margin requirements for such a position can be complicated, depending on the entire distribution of outcomes (chance of losing $1, chance of losing $2, ..., chance of losing $1000, etc).\n\nNow, (i) HFs usually compute risk over their entire portfolio, not per position, and (ii) this is what they were born for.  In other words, making maximally leveraged investments while managing risk *is the whole game*.

That's because they are not simply placing long or short bets.  They are placing bets along the entire distribution of outcomes.  They can conceivably be heavily leveraged on a bet that some 3-sigma event is unlikely.\n\nSo what happens is that some 5-sigma event (like the $GME spike) causes them to exit a long position, resulting in a 3-sigma event that was heavily levered against.\n\nA situation like this (multiplied leverage tied to a seemingly low-probability event) is exactly what caused the 2008 crash.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Theoretically yes.

There is an easy way to keep this up.\n\n**IF AT ANY POINT YOU FUCK UP AND SELL STOCK PUT DOWN A LOWER BUY ORDER AT THE SAME TIME**\n\nAs far as we know, hedges need to cover shorts at the < $320 range. If GME rockets to $1000 for example, and you need some cash to not starve to death and sell a share at $1000, immediately put down a buy order above $320. That way even if the stock falls a bit because of your paper hands, it will cushion at the new buy orders and start climbing back up.\n\n**IF EVERYONE WHO SELLS PUTS A BUY ORDER AT A PRICE POINT THE STOCK CANNOT FALL BELOW THAT PRICE POINT**\n\nI have no idea what is coming the next week or maybe even the next month. Maybe you retards crash the world economy. Maybe the stock will shoot high up and fall back down for a bit. I don't think however that the stock will tank all the way down to tens of $. There are too many of you retards who have bought up GME, locked it in a vault of your autism and thrown away the key. In normal stocks when price falls, people panic and sell until there is nothing left.

The reality of the situation is Robinhood does NOT have the liquidity or capital to support buys any further due to their clearing house being in house and run by baling wire and dreams. Their owners have a vested interest in ensuring they don't make the collateral demanded by the DTC to move the cash required. So here's the fucking rub. There are two CONFIRMED brokers that will do anything in their fucking power to ensure we trade as much as we fucking want. They are... üöÄüöÄFidelity and VanguardüöÄüöÄ. (I have also heard TDA is ok) You want to know why? They both own millions of shares in GME, do you think they won't do whatever they absolutely can to ensure collateral is covered on GME? They are profiting hardcore off of this. We NEED to be throwing their weight behind them, they are the ONLY future we have if we need to be backing this stock as retail. This weekend, we need to push harder than we ever have before to educate people on this reality. Robinhood is bush league shit for processing this kind of demand, and it's time we take it to the big boys like Fidelity and Vanguard to handle the rest of this.\n\nBasically, about 30% of GME shares are owned by just 3 investment firms (Blackrock, Fidelity, Vanguard). Another 30% is own by other investment firms and Ryan Cohen, which brings it to over 60%... all of who have a vested interest in seeing GME moon.\n\nTLDR: Robinhood CANNOT SUPPORT OUR VOLUME. The ONLY brokers right now are Vanguard and Fidelity because they OWN GME SHARES. This is PERFECT for us. Their clearing houses will flip fucking gravity to keep us trading. PUSH ON.
