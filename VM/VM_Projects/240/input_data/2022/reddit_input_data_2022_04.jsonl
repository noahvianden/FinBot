If the market believes rates will continue to rise and earnings growth will continue weaken then that dramatically changes valuations.\n\nI think most companies will probably post decent earnings this quarter, but the thing to look out for is the guidance. For example, if GOOG says they project digital ad spend growth to slow in the coming year due to reopening trends and weakening business confidence then valuations need to come down. Same could happen with AAPL as they're probably one of the more sensitive companies to a weaker consumer. Even if iPhone sales were great this quarter if they anticipate they could slow in the coming quarters then the stock is going to fall.\n\nI do agree that some people are too bearish right now though because economic conditions are changing so quickly it's silly to be all in or all out. It's quite possible over the next few weeks we could get some positive news that will act as a support for current valuations. China ending lockdowns or Russia ending the war in Ukraine for example would be seen as very favourably by the market. The big one though would be signs that inflation is peaking. Even if inflation remains elevated for some time a clear peak in the inflation data would take away the risk of an even more hawkish FED and a potential recession.\n\nThings could easily get worse though, and it's not hard to imagine how that might happen given all the risks.

So they are doing their part now (as much as they can considering how late they were to shift gears.)\n\nIt's on the economy now. It's all a moving target though. At the beginning of the year, with JP Morgan's Guide to the Markets, the 'consumer/household balance sheet' was touted as evidence that demand can be sustained. But in March, consumer credit grew by twice the expected rate. So now more of the demand driven by savings is credit driven.\n\nReading the commentary on UMich Consumer Survey Index, we are playing out the wage-price inflationary spiral. The market is sensing the 'hot inflation' phase is waning, where companies successfully raise prices to combat the early surge in inflation. The temporary beneficial part of inflation, which improves earnings and gives initial confidence that margins can be maintained, is close to played out.\n\n*\"Several other associated findings from the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey are also relevant. Although consumers have increasingly expected higher inflation, they have also expected a strong job market and rising wages, especially among consumers under age 45. In the year ahead, wage gains will continue to reduce resistance to rising prices among consumers, and the ability of firms to easily raise their selling prices will continue to reduce their resistance to increasing wages. Thus, the essential ingredients of a self-perpetuating wage-price spiral are now in place: rising inflation accompanied by rising wages.\"*\n\nIt is going to get a lot uglier but in the very long term, this is long overdue and is a good thing.
