I'll pasted the details that I deemed most important for everyone if they haven't seen it. \n\nAs follows\n\n \nIn July 2021, the Company issued $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior convertible promissory notes due July 23, 2026 (“2021 Convertible Notes”) in a private offering. The 2021 Convertible Notes mature on July 23, 2026 and accrue interest quarterly at a rate of (i) zero percent (0%) from the date of issuance to, and including, June 30, 2022 and (ii) five percent (5%) after June 30, 2022. The 2021 Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company’s equity under various circumstances, including upon an Initial Public Offering and a Change of Control of the Company (as such terms are defined in the 2021 Convertible Notes Purchase Agreement). Upon an Initial Public Offering, the 2021 Convertible Notes automatically convert into shares of the Company’s common stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of: (i) $71.03, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, recapitalization or any other similar transaction, and (ii) the product of (x) the Initial Public Offering price per share multiplied by (y) the applicable discount rate determined by reference to the time of conversion (0.85 until December 31, 2021).\n\nOn October 8, 2021, the Company issued $1,250 million aggregate principal amount of senior secured floating rate notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”) to certain investors of the Company. Proceeds received net of a $25 million original issue discount may be used for general corporate purposes. The 2026 Notes mature five years from the date of issuance, or earlier at 90 days before the maturity of the 2021 Convertible Notes if they remain outstanding (refer to Note 6 “Debt”). The 2026 Notes bear interest at (x) LIBOR, subject to a 1.00% floor, plus (y) 6.00% per annum, subject to downward adjustment upon certain events. Interest on the 2026 Notes is paid in cash semi-annually in arrears on October 15 and April 15 of each year. The Company has the option to redeem the notes at any time at 100% of the principal amount of the 2026 Notes, plus any applicable premium. The 2026 Notes contain a number of customary covenants similar to the covenants under the ABL Facility (refer to Note 6 “Debt”) and a minimum liquidity covenant. The 2026 Notes are secured by a second priority security interest in the same assets in which the ABL Facility has a first priority security interest and are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company.\n\nFrom July 2021 through October 31, 2021, the Company granted less than 1 million stock options at a weighted-average exercise price of $39.58 per share and 12 million RSUs. The stock options require a service period to vest and require a Change in Control to become exercisable. The RSUs require a service period and an Initial Public Offering (as defined in the Plan) to vest. Similar to the Company’s existing options and RSUs, the performance based vesting conditions are not deemed to be probable until such events occur. The issuance of these options and RSUs has resulted in an incremental $496 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation.\n\nDuring October 2021, the Company modified the service-based vesting terms of approximately 6 million options. As the modified options contain a performance condition that is satisfied upon a Change of Control, the fair value of the options was remeasured on the date of modification which resulted in an increase in unrecognized compensation cost of approximately $265 million.\n\nIn October 2021, the Company approved the funding of Forever by Rivian, Inc. (the Company’s social welfare organization) with shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, subject to the completion of its initial public offering. The approved amount is equal to 1% of the Company’s outstanding capital stock on a fully diluted basis immediately before the completion of the initial public offering. As a result of this donation, the Company will recognize a one-time, non-cash expense, the amount of which is dependent upon the ultimate price per share recognized at the time of the offering (e.g., the expense would be approximately $495 million if the initial public offering price were $59.50 per share, which is currently the midpoint of the estimated initial public offering price range)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Are you still going to buy even though they changed the price to $72?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "So I already committed to 100 shares.

Just last week multiple articles came out that said they were producing only 1 vehicle a day.\n\n* If history has shown us anything, Rivian is going to go through production hell getting an assembly line working to up that number to something reasonable. Take a look back at all the complaints and criticism levied at Tesla back then, most of it is probably going to be said about Rivian in the coming months.\n\n* Rivian's order from Amazon actually puts them in a not so good position right now due to their customer concentration. Rivian wants to attract regular consumers to their brand, but Rivian has to take time away from that to focus on producing Amazon vans to keep Amazon happy. And Jeff Bezos has made clear he's not willing to wait around for those vans given how he's tweeted \"Now RJ, where are our vans?!\". If you read what's in the contract with Amazon you'll see that there's farther time pressures on Rivian to get the Amazon vans made, because Amazon has the option to buy from someone else if Rivian can't do it in a timely manner.\n\nBesides those immediate issues, I see other potential red flags with Rivian that don't sit right with me.\n\n* Rivian hyped up their tank turn a while ago, only to quietly remove it as a feature because of issues with it (issues that essentially come down to the laws of physics making a safe and controlled tank turn very difficult to pull off, especially on certain types of surfaces). Based on insider reports Rivian did very little work on this before abandoning it, making it clear the whole point of it was just to counter the Cybertruck excitement at the time. If you take a closer look at the Rivian tank turn footage you'll notice a LOT of tire treads, implying they tried it A LOT to get just the right footage where it worked correctly. Hyping up a feature as a PR stunt only to abandon it after getting the footage they want makes me wary of trusting Rivian.\n\n* In my opinion Rivian moves way too slow to be successful long term. Rivian is 12 years old, and only just brought a vehicle to the market. Maybe that would have been ok in the past, but things are moving quickly in the EV space now that most automakers are taking it seriously.

{"title": "Why Lucid Group will be a huge success NO MATTER WHAT.", "selftext": "For those that are unaware because they are blinded by their love for video game and movie stocks, but Electric Vehicles are just now beginning their race. Tesla and Elon Musk are undoubtedly the common EV manufacturer. I doubt anything will change Tesla's position as the bulk EV manufacturer for quite some time.\n\nLucid just put their cars on the road for the first time a week ago. Let's compare Lucid's top model to Tesla's to get an understanding of what this company has to offer the consumer.\n\n________________\n\nTesla Model S Plaid: \n\n396 mile range, 0-60mph in 1.99 seconds, 200mph top speed, 1020 hp.\n\nPrice: $124,490.\n\n_________________\n\nLucid Dream Edition R:\n\n520 mile range, 0-60 in 2.5 seconds, 933 hp, 168 mph.\n\nPrice: $168,000\n\n________________\n\nFor anyone with half witted sense of reality, what this means is that Lucid's top vehicle out ranges Tesla's by over 100 miles! The range EVs can go before needing juice is the BIGGEST drawback to EVs!\n\nLucid also has a base model. The Air Pure. It is $77,000 and has a range of 406 miles.\n\nWhich brings me to my major point.\n\nLet's say, hypothetically, that Rawlinson and his team can't make cars for shit.\n\nThey're absolutely incompetent and their cars suck. This of course ISN'T the case. Reviews of the first order of cars is that they are fantastic vehicles.\n\nThese guys already make a better BATTERY than Tesla!\n\nAnd its so important that we as consumers understand that the better battery ALONE will lead Lucid to success. Efficiency is key. Energy, how its generated, and the efficiency at which it outputs energy is becoming more and more important because gasoline becomes more scarce every day.\n\nThese new EV manufacturers can, and probably already are, in the business of energy storage. These batteries could power our homes and everything else too. Which is what makes these companies great. The technology can be used outside of vehicles to power our world in a more efficient manner.\n\nAnd right now, Lucid and their unmatched batteries just gained the lead in that department.\n\nSo watch. As Lucid vehicles drive down every street in America within the next 2 years. Because nothing makes a car popular other than itself. Driving down roads. For all the world to see.\n\nLucid's stock price of roughly $40 will haunt you compared to what it IS worth because its going nowhere but up.\n\nAlso, the damn cars look EXTREMELY NICE. Huge Porsche vibes in quality and design. But definitely its own look.\n\nBuy Lucid Group stock while you still can for profit. Its competing with Tesla at 1200 a share when it is at 40.\n\nAlso, buy me a Lucid Air.

I'm guessing they did this because of all the drama that was swirling around, and they felt that doing this would get people talking about something totally different, and it's actually worked pretty well for them.\n\nHow many metaverse related posts have we seen since early November?

Zuck was basically talking about these Raybans that people would wear that are 5mm thick and have all this unbelievable hardware miniaturized and stuffed inside it. The problem is, miniaturizing all that hardware isn't going to be trivial at all. Another problem too, is the fact that even if all this worked like they planned it to, I think 5mm thick Raybans are going to look pretty dorky. It's easy to say 5mm thickness, and people don't really think that's too bad, but wait till they see and feel what 5mm thick looks like in real life. I think regular glasses are like 3mm thick. I seriously doubt they were using 5mm thick glasses on the people in their promo videos.\n\nAll this stuff I've been saying might sound negative, but at the same time, this shit is going to be the ultimate game changer. VR is going to kill all other forms of entertainment eventually. We already have the technology to completely take over your visuals and audio, and have perfect representations of the real world, at least from a seeing and hearing standpoint.\n\nThink about that for just a second.

At concerts and sporting events, we're mostly just using our eyes and ears. That's the stimulus. We're not touching anything.\n\nOk, so we can't replicate touch.... yet.

It is not like flat gaming at all.\n\nWill Meta make the metaverse?: I doubt it. They will try, but many people take issue with Facebook and how they treat their product, oops I mean customers.\n\nThe metaverse is already happening and it will come to be organically: I know it is not a lot, but there are now typically 20k to 30k users online at any time in VRChat. If you look into what that program is, you'll see that it is mostly user uploaded content based on the Unity engine. As you can imagine, there is a vast variety of places to go and things to do. There are meditative spaces, night clubs, horror maps, game rooms, movie worlds (to watch movies, youtube, or anime or whatever), recreations of real-world places, and so on. The social aspect of the game is what draws me back there, but on its own is lacking basic features. Discord became a necessary companion app. Now I am on quite a few servers there now to stay connected to people I know in VRChat. You can also use both programs simultaneously with an overlay program in VR. The organic part is that no one decided to merge these programs, people started doing it out of necessity. So on any Saturday night, I am in a club (I am an old guy, but still likes to dance) hanging out with 20 somethings with a lot of energy, we can be speaking to each other through VRChat or Discord. I'm in my avatar which I bought from someone I connected with through the game and Discord, then customized to look the way I want with Unity. I bought shaders from someone else to use in Unity to make those custom tweaks. With a flip of my wrist, I can pull up my desktop, and pick a song in Soundpad to play for everyone in the room to dance to.\n\nWhere is this all going?: hard to say, but there is enough potential and momentum that it will not die like 3d tv. BTW, the last 3d movie I watched was within VRChat, so have we come full circle?\nNFT and virtual real-estate: I don't see it happening. I don't see NFT as needed or even useful. No one cares about your virtual plot of land except other speculators.

Take human distance interaction for example: in my eyes, using even better technology to interact with people from a distance in an increasingly \"realistic\" way is very natural. At first we use only our voices at home or our offices (landlines), then we use our voices from anywhere (mobile), then we can see faces (Facetime/video chat), and now we can participate in big meetings with people from all around the world. It is only a natural technology development that people in future want to feel distance interaction as \"real\" as possible. Back then when facetime was out, parents were excited to see how they can see their kids by video chat; imagine the excitement of people when they can enjoy activities in VR with their SO/kids/friends living far away.\n\nI both agree and disagree that the metaverse is overhyped. I agree with that because a lot of people are chasing the idea that metaverse is something which will change our life in a few years, and everyone will live with goggles strapped to their head soon. Such hype is equivalent to how we perceived that in 2010 we would have hoverboards and so. The hardware and infrastructure is still very expensive for mass adoption.\n\nI disagree though that metaverse will be a flop; if anything, it will slowly but surely, and most importantly, naturally becomes integrated into our lives. If putting on giant goggles are weird, then miniaturization shall solve that; brick phones were super eyecatching in the past, but today's you have way, way more functions in tiny electronics as small as a watch. \n\nI still remember when I brought out my iPad in a subway to read stuff in China; people were looking at me like some crazy dude using a big screen like that. Also when people think that using a watch or an earpiece to talk is weird. By today, nobody cares about such appearances anymore.\n\nedit: also I should state that I don't buy into investing (I almost forgot this is /r/stocks) into \"metaverse\".

Strapping an iPhone on your right eye to see AR is stupid, but putting on a Google Glass X in probably 2030 however isn't that out of place.\n\nAlso replacing TV/movies with VR when used in your house (as you originally mentioned) is not something completely crazy. Currently, watching movies on your VR set is a complete downgrade of enjoyment due to a sever lack of good VR content, and VR display technology still hasn't reached the point that it eliminate issues such as screen door effects.

{"title": "Some Basic but very useful Options help from a full-time trader", "selftext": "I posted this as a reply to a thread in WallStreetBets.  I thought someone might find it useful.\n\nThe stocks you pick to trade options also matter a great deal.  For example; I prefer NVDA & TSLA lately because they often recover very well from selloffs and will give you clearer direction.  Both obviously are popular and their profitability will continue to bring in more buyers.  Also, they are volatile and move well in both directions with NVDA being the easier of the two to trade.  \n\nIf you have been losing money trading options because of volatility, getting shaken out, stress, etc then the following strategy may help.  Determine the latest hot sector of the market i.e. energy, financials, retail, etc and trade options in the corresponding ETF.  For example XLE - Energy, XLF - Financials, etc.  These ETFs can still make you good money and won't move dramatically in either position.  They can help you learn the mechanics and make money at the same time without exhausting your mental energy.\n\nMy personal basic strategy is to find the ITM call or put that has the highest open interest and volume.  These usually have the tightest spreads and make it easy for me to move in and out.\n\nTry not to focus on the P/L, as you will get shaken out easily, but rather trade the chart. Sell half of your position at predetermined resistance levels that lose momentum without hesitation.  This will ensure profitable trades. \n\nAlso, if you are newer to options trading then I recommend only trading 1 contract at a time as this will keep your stress level down and allow you understand how the particular stock/option you are in behaves.  (Yes, they have their own behavior lol). \n\nIf you are more of an intermediate trader then slowly add to your position.  If i intend to buy 10 contracts I will add 1-2 at the point when I get to my target entry.  Often times what we believe is a great entry will temporarily break down and offer us a better entry.  This is when I will add more.  If I don't get the small capitulation move down then i add on the way up.
