The indicator can help day traders confirm when they might want to initiate a trade, and it can also be used to determine the placement of a stop-loss order. Typically, the number of periods used in the calculation is 14 (days, weeks, etc.). Day traders can use ATR information, about how much an asset typically moves in a certain period, for plotting profit targets, and for determining whether to attempt a trade. Developed by J. Welles Wilder, the Average True Range (ATR) is an indicator that measures volatility. As with most of his indicators, Wilder designed ATR with commodities and daily prices in mind.

It is a daily two-bar chart pattern that contains a price range which is both above and below the prior day’s range. It also features a higher high and a lower low on the second day when compared to the bar of the first preceding day. On a candlestick chart, you will see a larger candle than the previous day’s candle. It is essentially the opposite of an inside day candle. An outside day candle, in a general sense, means that volatility is increasing due to a much larger range of prices than the previous day. It can also be an indication of an outside reversal, which means that the price of a stock begins moving in the opposite direction from the previous trend.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah makes sense.

I bought 10 call contracts of AMZN for $10.678 each around 9:33 am. At that time of my purchase, AMZN stock price was about $3250 and the strike price of the call contracts was $3300 that expires tomorrow. What that means is I speculated that by 4:00 pm tomorrow AMZN will be over $3300 and I paid $10.678 premium per share for that contract. Remember that each contract is my privilege to buy 100 shares of AMZN at 3300 per share. Now if AMZN closes at $3400 tomorrow then I can buy 1000 (10 contracts \\* 100 shares) shares of AMZN for only $3300 per shares. Which means I will profit 100\\*1000=100K minus the total premium of 10.67K (roughly 89.33K). \n\nKeep in mind that, most people do not have that kind of money to buy 1000 shares of AMZN and most don't buy these contracts with an intention to buy the underlying stocks.\n\nNow, around 9:38 am, after 5 minutes of my purchase of these contracts, AMZN stock price moved up to about 3270. That's a increase in $20 per share which caused my contracts to increase their value to $18.69. Which means a $20 increase in underlying stock price increased the value of the contracts by $8. In order to understand why only $8 but not $20 you have to understand how these contracts work. Anyways, at that time I sold them at $18.69 per contracts resulting in a total of 18.69K (10 contracts \\*$18.69 per share\\*100 shares)(remember I paid 10.67\\*) netting a total profit of $8K.\n\nI could also make money by buying 1000 shares of AMZN at $3250 per share but that would need me to invest 3.25 million dollars! With that $20 per share price increase I could make 20K instead of 8K but duh! I do not have 3.25 million dollars. Even if I had I would not just buy that many AMZN shares just to make 20K (That's just 0.61% vs 80% that I made).\n\nSo far what I have wrote was all good but imagine AMZN went down by 20 in that 5 minutes. In that case I could lose around 70-80% in that 5 minutes! And that happened as many times as I made profit if not more. \n\nTlDr: I risked $10.6K for some AMZN options expiring tomorrow and got lucky with timing a.k.a gambling paid off.

Now the difference between the strike price of $3300 and the closing price of $3306.37 is only $6.37. Which means the contract only worth $6.37 because if you buy shares at 3300 when the share price is actually 3306.37, it make sense that you pay 6.37 extra as the premium because that's the actual difference between the true stock price and the strike price. This value is also known as intrinsic value of an option. Now, this scenario is true if the option expire today but he option is expiring tomorrow and no one in this world knows what will be the closing price of AMZN tomorrow. What if AMZN closes at 3400 tomorrow? Which means whoever is selling that option is taking a risk on a speculation that AMZN will lose lower than today. For taking that risk he is charging you an extra $20.2-6.37=$13.83. This extra value of the premium is called the extrinsic value of an option. Which means an option has it's true (intrinsic) value and an extrinsic (mostly premium for taking risk)\n\nOptions have five parameters known as Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega and Rho. The extrinsic value of any contract, be it a call or put, at a given time depends on these five Greeks. When a stock price changes over time, depending on how much change and how fast the change is, these parameters change and hence the option contract price. Every option contract has a expiry date and the most important parameter is the **theta** when the expiry date is close. This is basically how much the contract will lose vale in a single day inherently, if the stock price remain the same a whole day. For instance, the one I traded today expires tomorrow and has the theta value of -$15.53. Which means if AMZN remains at 3306.37 the whole day tomorrow and close at that price, that 3300 call option price will be $(20.20-15.53)=$4.67.\n\nNow consider the person who paid $20.2 for the contract buying 100 shares of AMZN at 3300 per share. He will pay 330K for 100 shares. He already paid $20.2\\*100=$2020 resulting in his net cost for owning 100 AMZN shares at $332020. Now consider the closing actual price of 100 shares at $3306.37\\*100=$330637. A net loss of $1383 per contract. If he bought 10 contract like me then a net loss of $13830 and so on. What is the point?\n\nThe main point is there is no guaranty that AMZN will close above todays closing price tomorrow. What if AMZN closes $3270? The price of your option will be 0. AMZN need to close above $3320.2 (3300 for stock+ 20.2 for premium) just for you to break even. If it closes above $3320.2 only then you can make money. If the expiry date is few days ahead and I am at a small loss then I might wait to see if it recovers because that time theta would be relatively smaller than the one that expires tomorrow.\n\nIn the above example I simplified many things to make it easy to comprehend. I did not consider the inter-relationship between those Greeks while explaining the decay of option value. Hope it was helpful.\n\nEdit: If it did not go my way I would wait few hours to see if it recovers only if the total loss was below 30%.

{"title": "CLOV will be a multi-bagger", "selftext": "I'm a long term CLOV investor and do not believe the recent price action reflects a squeeze of any kind. More likely that wall street investors woke up to CLOV potential because of [this](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement) CMS update that announces CLOV participation in 10 US states in PY 2021. (This is my first reddit post so here goes)\n\nBelow is why I (a regular, retail investor) have held on to CLOV shares and warrants in my portfolio and why I believe getting in on this stock under $15 is a no brainer (disclaimer: I’m not a financial advisor and this is NOT investment advice, do your own DD before investing):\n\n1. **Business Model:** Clover Health is a Medicare Advantage insurance company. [Sources of revenue for MA insurers](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-is-medicare-advantage-funded) include premiums and payments via CMS, most of which goes to hospitals and doctors. In MA, specially under plans offered by CLOV, premiums are negligible so for our purpose payments made by CMS (government) are the lifeblood of MA plans such as Clover. You may be wondering so what? Well, let’s put things in perspective. The US federal govt spent $1.2 Trillion on healthcare in 2019, $644 Billion of this went to Medicare of which $270B was spent on MA. All or most of this growing annual budget goes to fund MA plans such as Clover for services they provide members. The problem is, there are too many visits and hospitalizations (than are needed). What if there was an innovative startup that used innovation (pay doctors fixed fees per visit) and technology (Clover Assistant software with telehealth features) such that federal government paid out LESS per member to such a company vs. competition ([target outcome of Direct Contracting](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/direct-contracting)) for HIGHER quality of care. Great ability to capture market share from legacy insurers and help lower government spending (more on this later) – a WIN-WIN situation for insurer and the govt. This is why Clover’s business model is so fool proof!***TLDR:*** ***Clover operates in a space that is majority funded by government, and its unique business model helps it gain market share***\n2. **Competition:** Now let’s talk competition. Competitors such as Humana, United Health, CVS/Aetna have for years delivered medical insurance but hardly innovated in a way that was positive for federal spending. They continued charging seniors on plan premiums, while trying to receive as much funding as possible from the fed to grow their profits. Why make the process more efficient when all we do to get paid is to broker insurance plans in a highly regulated industry. Clover with its innovation is miles ahead of the competition by getting a nice head start (started in 2014, while other [insurers are just getting started with the innovation)](https://medcitynews.com/2021/02/mercy-humana-partner-to-expand-access-to-virtual-value-based-care/) and the Clover Assistant software will constantly help it become more efficient i.e. achieve better results for its members, at a lower cost to CMS!! CLOV is also MORE HOLISTIC than TDOC in services, while targeting a LOWER TAM i.e. only Seniors right now. Only a matter of time that they expand beyond MA and offer plans for the general population.***TLDR: Clover is disrupting competition through its use of technology.***\n3. **Software:** Now the bit about software. This IS Clover’s secret ingredient. The development is led by an ex-Googler (Andrew Toy, President at Clover Health) to radically transform software used to treat seniors through massive digitization, and interactive UI. This in turn helps doctors improve outcomes for patients. And they are giving it away for free!!! Why would a physician not use software that helped him/her improve the standard of care for their patients while being easy to use and access and FREE. Imagine, Marc Benioff giving away Salesforce for free to sales reps all over. When this software becomes the standard of care because of the years of head start they have in this space, Clover Health could eventually license this to the other insurers and health care providers i.e. additional sources of revenue.***TLDR: The Clover Assistant software is the secret ingredient that helps the company deliver efficient care and achieve better outcomes.***\n4. **Growth:** Ok so we briefly spoke about licensing as an additional mode of revenue, now let’s focus on others. 2) Current projections indicate 14% annual organic growth of MA population, this growth is likely to go bonkers when Biden reduces the Medicare eligible age to 60, as [promised](https://joebiden.com/fact-sheet-how-joe-biden-would-help-you-get-health-insurance-coverage-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/)in his campaign. Evergreen and ever-growing TAM 3) Direct Contracting introduced by CMS is basically a risk sharing model that incentivizes insurers to make treatment of seniors more efficient and cost effective. Insurers that can achieve a lower cost of treatment and fewer hospital visits for the same condition, they are likely to be held in favor by CMS when allotting MA counties every year. Now, if you remember the bit about software, Clover is in the best position to do this…as long as doctors continue to use the Clover Assistant software to treat seniors. This may sound like a risky bet, but it really isn’t….60%+ of Clover members see a PCP that uses the Clover Assistant software. Clover’s [long-term goal](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/ed2bc09d-cd96-4759-897e-862c2b250213) is to get to a 70%+ rate. 4) End 2020, Clover offered MA plans in 34 counties but this will grow based on participation in more states as per the [CMS Direct Contracting plan for 2021](https://innovation.cms.gov/media/document/gpdc-model-participant-announcement).***TLDR: Growth in MA membership, direct contracting, geographic expansion, potential to license its software are all lucrative growth avenues.***\n5. **Customers:** Let’s now put some light on the target demographic…seniors. Clover is promising them the lowest cost plans ($0 premiums, low/no co-pays) which are highly flexible (telehealth on Clover Assistant) to their needs. Why not? In addition, Clover is developing partnerships with Walmart and other retailers to market their plans which is likely to result in an ever-growing customer and incentivized partner base.\n6. **Media:** The media has lambasted this company quite vocally including on CNBC despite little of substance…except that there was a short-seller report and questions asked about the CEO. To his credit, Cramer recently invited Clover Health to Mad Money…now, when this interview happens it is likely to introduce the company to a pretty massive list of retail investors (the buy and hold kind) and when they realize how undervalued Clover is, they will likely pick up a good portion of the float, causing fewer and fewer shares to be available.\n7. **Management:** If one reads through the exec incentive structure in [SPAC prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1801170/000119312520316032/d69158d424b3.htm#toc69158_24), they would soon realize that the CEO has most of his interest in the company tied to the stock – he does not receive a salary. More importantly, both CEO and President performance-based incentive plans do not kick in until CLOV reaches and maintains a volume weighted average price of $30 for a 90-day period. Consider also, **Lee Shapiro who sits on the board of Clover Health is the former CFO of Livongo (now part of TDOC, ARK fav) while Chelsea Clinton adds serious weight and is actively involved as board member and dem access. Recently they added the former director of Medicare - literally the only possible guy in the world that can get them what they need to continue growth for years to come.**\n8. **Valuation:** SPAC merger docs value the company at $3.7B. Currently, because of the short seller report and the massive short-interest in the company, it is valued at \\~$3B, which is \\~4x 2021E sales. With projected revenues for 2021 of $835M (mid-point), and applying a 8x sales multiple, Clover’s valuation needs to be at least $6.7B+ market cap implying a $16+ PT. With expected 24%+ growth in 2021, and premium multiple for high growth companies (note that the float is only 25% of shares outstanding), I believe a $20-25 target is more in line with current valuations. When medicare eligible age limit is lowered to 60 by Biden later this year or perhaps early next, this PT will need to be re-evaluated…upward. Also consider the fact that this company is NOT zero revenue now, promising billions in 2025 and beyond….it had sales of $670M in sales in 2020 and growing!! Consider also that the industry-leader in the telehealth space – TDOC – and a Cathie Wood & ARK fav currently trades at 16x sales. Similar multiple for CLOV implies a $33 PT.***TLDR: Whichever way you cut it, CLOV is very undervalued right now. Near term $25-30 PT and longer term has LMND-like potential in healthcare insurance***\n\nI am long CLOV because I believe that it is trying to solve a very hard and complex problem in healthcare.

Competition:** new competitors trying to enter the fast growing (but boring) MA market with an advanced tech platform ala Clover Assistant could impact growth rate (not growth). I think its highly unlikely but possible specially when Biden announces lowering the Medicare eligibility age. Smaller companies might want to get in on the gold rush.

In researching, I found out it was still undervalued, and man, has it shown. Even when it tumbled, it hasn’t been a nightmarish fall. 6.5% growth already.\n\n2) AbbVie (ABBV) - I knew nothing about this company and spent three days researching it before I bought its stock, and it’s been one of the best purchased ever. It doesn’t grow as fast, but it hardly ever falls, even when the whole market is tanking. Also, its dividend is huge (4.46%).

The proprietary nature of MAC was his game plan and he actively attacked clone makers. This is why they lost the PC war. This is why he was removed. Yes we had MAC clones too but Steve went out of his way to sue them and shut them down.\n\nThe MAC was not all roses. It was riddled with problems the biggest being that by the time each was released, it was already obsolete. Back then CPU and Mem advancement was insanely fast so being behind in hardware just 1 year made you obsolete and to add salt to the wound, Steve always wanted to charge a surplus for his machines. Back then they were very expensive so paying a premium for a obsolete machine was not going to end well. Today this is less of an issue because even something obsolete can pretty much do what most people need. Not so back then.\n\nThe MAC had major design issues. Due to being traditional RISC, it was insanely hard to code for and slow as hell at multitasking thus making it a pain to program for and not fun to use. It was good at very specific things like certain vector calculations when implemented correctly (though not for long... MMX killed it). But if you tried to use, say photoshop and listen to a mp3... lol good luck. Browser + Application? Hope you have a lot of patience... Windows on the other hand with a CISC processor handled such things seamlessly and was a lot easier to program.\n\nSteves return didnt save Apple. He just happened to be around when MS screwed up with Windows ME. That was a disaster and MAC was around to take market share as the disaster transpired.

{"title": "FORD DD - $F - Don't worry about debt", "selftext": "Ford is great value investment considering it will compete with TESLA for EV market - Most of bear case is ford debt and they are 100% wrong. Please read below article.\n\n**$FORD   P/E - 12.5**    \n**$TESLA  P/E - 580.9**\n\nWhile Ford Credit may seem like loading itself with loads of debt, the fact is that the majority of the debt was originated from lending services provided by **Ford Credit (Car Loans and Leasing)**\n\nIn other words, the majority of the debt is asset-backed and is repaid by cash collected from Ford’s finance receivables.\n\nIn short, Ford Credit debt is safe and is backed by collateral.\n\nAdditionally, Ford’s automotive debt has also declined from its peak level of $40 billion to about $25 billion as of 2020 Q4.\n\nAt this level, Ford’s $50 billion cash position is more than enough to cover the automotive debt.\n\nTherefore, there is little cause for concern for Ford’s $160 billion debt load.\n\nFrom old post:\n\n1. New CEO is phenominal. Car industry his whole life. He is making meaningful change to Ford and can show he can keep his promises. This can be seen by the insane turn around even during a pandemic and his ability to increase profits even now. They released Janaury numbers, and overall outpacing sales in the industry by 4% and growing. I expect strong 2021 outlook.\n2. The CEO is focused on PROFITS rather than simple revenue. Paying down debts, closing massively unprofitable brands, reinvesting in more profitable brands. For example; earlier this year, they closed a brazil plant but reinvest 1.1 billion in South Africa.\n3. The Truck market specifically is exploding right now and that will only get better with the Electric f150. They are hyping it up and in general doing a good job hyping up alot of their brands. This will be the biggest thing for ford in a while.\n4. They have 2 other extremely promising aspects. First, their mustang, and more importanly their fleet vans. Ford fleet vans have basically a monopoly in the area. The only real competition is the mercedez amazon vans you see around, but even then, its not a big deal. Ford has announced plans to get fully automated self driving fleet vans to market.\n5. The electric mustang might not seem like a big deal but they did it for a reason. Its controversial, but thats ok, and maybe even good. Most have looked into it, some have bought it. They have basically instantly sold out everytime they released selling them. They might only have a few thousand to sell due to chip shortages, but that will be remedied shortly, and they plan on producing their own chips anyway, which could be massive.\n6. Rivian. The details havent been fully announced but most speculate about a 15% stake in the company when it was only worth about a billion dollars. Their most recent valuation puts them at 45 billion. They made several billion on that investment alone.\n7. One of first things The CEO has announced at the top of their to do list is quality control. They want vehicles more reliable and less lemons. As they rebrand themselves, this will be massive and critical. People like nice cars and Tesla has raised the bar. This can be seen through their recent google partnership to basically overhaul the tech aspects of their cars.\n\nOther side note:  2022 Ford F-150 Lightning is big hit with everyone - [https://www.motor1.com/reviews/508450/2022-ford-f150-lightning-first-ride/](https://www.motor1.com/reviews/508450/2022-ford-f150-lightning-first-ride/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://stockdividendscreener.com/auto-manufacturers/ford-total-debt-and-leverage-ratio-analysis/](https://stockdividendscreener.com/auto-manufacturers/ford-total-debt-and-leverage-ratio-analysis/)", "id": "nhmv7n", "created_utc": 1621582832.0, "score": 110, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 171, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "I come from the future, I hope you have diamond hands.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Because it just skyrocketed 15%", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "With the inflation happening nowadays I’ll remind you at 2000%", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "From a dealership perspective as a Ford salesman I can tell you people love the new models.

Tesla has battery technology they will provide higher power output and density per dollar than its competitors in a huge way. Then, on top of that, you take into account the economies of scale they are going to achieve, and low cost they are going to achieve with the casting machines. What you get is a car body that is cheaper then the competitors, with battery technology that can provide the same range, acceleration, and longevity for a far cheaper price.
