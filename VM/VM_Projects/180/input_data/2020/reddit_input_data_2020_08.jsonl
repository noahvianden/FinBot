{"title": "Investing vs Trading: A reminder of tax implications", "selftext": "*TOP EDIT:* This post has gotten a lot more attention than I expected. Due to some critiques posted in this thread, let me preface this post with this statement: Please consult your own personal and trusted tax professional. Don't believe anything you read on the internet without verifying all the information yourself. Tax code in the US is complicated, and this post is primarily US focused. The information in here may be over simplified, but its meant to get people thinking about the implications of various trading activities on their taxable income. Its better to start now thinking about your 2020 tax burden rather than in December when you can't do anything about it.\n\n = = =\n\nWe've seen lots of posts recently from \"new\" investors freaking out over recent dips in the market and deciding whether they should get in or out. This is just a quick little post (and reminder) that anyone buying stocks should remind themselves about the impact of taxes on the trades their making.\n\nLets take the most recent meme stocks example: FSLY and NET\n\nLets assume you bought FSLY and NET on July 1 because you felt bullish going into the July 4th weekend. You would have bought Net at $37 and FSLY at $86.50.\n\nNow lets assume that you were smart enough to get out at the peak, which was August 4 for both stocks. FSLY would have sold for $116 and Net for $42.50. That means a 34% gain on FSLY and 15% gain on NET.\n\nBut here's something you should ALWAYS think about: if you sell you need to subtract 34% for the tax man since that holding was less than 1 year and it is taxed as income. So your 34% gain on FSLY is actually a 22% gain, and your 15% gain on NET is actually a 10% gain.\n\nNow lets do the numbers:\n\nIf you held FSLY for 1 year (until July 1, 2021), you only needed to get it to a price of $105 (not $116) to make the same money. For NET you had to hit a price of $40.70 (not $42.50).\n\nKeep all this in perspective when you look to \"take profits\" or \"should I keep holding my stock\".\n\nAlso, this DOES NOT take into effect the reallocation of capital. If you only have $100 to play with, and you bought FSLY at $86.50, holding for 1 year could be opportunity cost on other potential plays. In that case, you probably fucked up in timing your entry and exist. If you only have $100 to play, then what were your objectives on a stock that is already up 400% in 3 months? Did you expect another 100% movement after earnings because you prayed to JPow for more stimulus?\n\nBe realistic and critical about each move. These \"the stock is down, what should I do?\" posts are getting old. Here's a better question that should be posted to this sub: \"The stock is down to X, which is Y times the revenue to market cap ratio. I've done this research to indicate that the company can grow at this rate, which doesn't align to analysts. What are other people's opinion of my research so that I can more accurately assess my own personal price target for this stock I own, or am planning to own\" </rant>\n\n\n**Edit:** Based on some of the comments below, I think its important we clarify that America has a graduated tax system: https://taxfoundation.org/2019-tax-brackets/\n\nEffective tax rates for someone making $150,000 a year would be around 20% for federal income tax. Beyond that, I think its also important to know that long term capital gains tax is a graduated system where most people would be at 15% step: \nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital_gains_tax.asp\n\nIf you're single filing tax payer, and you're making $150,000 a year, then the difference between selling short term and long term is more like 5%. Sell now and realize the gains as income (ie. 20% effective tax rate) or hold and sell later to realize the gains as capital gains (ie. < 15% effective tax rate). The question is, can you reliably put up gains via trading that exceed that 5% buffer. If you cannot, then buy and hold. If you can, then trade!\n\n**Edit2:** In addition to taxes, I think to be a better trader, every person at the end of the year should do a comparison of what every stock they bought/sold would have netted them if they had just bought and held. Obviously, this assumes infinite capital since you can't do any reallocation. But it would be a good exercise! Spend a couple hours calculating how much money you made doing trading, then compare it to if you had just bought a couple of good movement stocks (ie. reliable like AAPL, MSFT, or more volatile like SHOP, SQ, TSLA) and just held them. Replaying trades is important, and understanding the tax implications of each strategy, and then weigh that against how much time and effort it took to trade. If the numbers don't add up, change up your strategy.", "id": "i782wm", "created_utc": 1597076900.0, "score": 613, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 176, "comments": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 559, "replies": [{"body": "This.

So in reality you would only pay 24% on the last $15k of your $100k income. the majority of it (from 10-85k) would be taxed at 12% + 22% / 2 = approximately 17%.

{"title": "All the cool kids are using LEAPS", "selftext": "You might be absolute ass at choosing stocks. You might constantly buy the top and sell the bottom. That's okay- most people do suck at trading. Fortunately, those who trade like shit can use LEAPS to make money without having to worry about buying at the wrong time or try inversing themselves. But what is a LEAPS, and why are the cool kids buying them?\n\n*tl;dr: LEAPS are long-dated calls that can help you leverage yourself without the usual risks of leveraging yourself. Use LEAPS if you are not good at trading.*\n\nPositions: *Long SPY 12/21/2022 $250c for about $9,980.*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nFor those who actually want to learn something, let's talk about LEAPS.\n\n**Long-term Equity AnticiPation Securities**, or LEAPS, are the antithesis of most options plays. LEAPS are call options that do not expire for many months, usually more than a year. Often, certain stocks offer LEAPS that don't expire for 2+ years. These call contracts are very versatile. Here's what they can do for you:\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Leveraging yourself to your personal risk tolerance:** LEAPS offer the investor an opportunity to leverage himself into any optionable stock. If a trader wants to take a large position in PRU with the belief that the stock will rise gradually for the next 2 years, then buying shares would be a good way to profit. With a $5,000 portfolio, the investor could buy about 80 shares. Alternatively, the investor could instead buy 5x 1/21/2022 $60 LEAPS for $1,200 each. These LEAPS have a delta of 0.675, so owning 5 LEAPS is the equivalent of owning about 337 shares. With a smaller portfolio, the trader has effectively more than quadrupled his exposure to PRU.\n\n**Stock Replacement:** Similar to the above, the investor can use LEAPS to take positions in contracts that are similar to owning shares, but at a lower cost. If the investor could find a LEAPS with a delta of 1.000, then the call would follow the underlying stock to the penny. However, LEAPS tend to cap out between 0.900 and 0.950. Buying a 0.950 delta is usually close enough to owning shares to satisfy the investor. So rather than spend $5,600 to own 100 shares of AMD, the investor can buy a 1/22/2022 $40 LEAPS for $2,100. That contract has a delta of 0.900, so for $2,100, the trader has effectively purchased 90 shares. This leaves the $5,000 account investor with $2,900 for other plays. Using LEAPS can help diversify one‚Äôs portfolio by spreading a smaller amount of capital across many positions.\n\n**Stock Replacement with Leverage:** Big brain time. You can sell deep ITM puts with deltas above 0.900 to take a position virtually identical to if you had bought 90 shares. But in the case of selling puts, you don‚Äôt have to spend any money. In fact, you get paid a nice premium for selling ITM put LEAPS, and depending on your broker, you might only need to hold 10% of the collateral in cash. In theory, you could sell a handful of 0.900 delta put LEAPS for a hefty premium, which you can then turn around and use to buy call LEAPS. If you are correct and the stock takes a boat to the moon, you will benefit doubly. The short put LEAPS will lose value causing a gain, and the long call LEAPS will increase in value. Be careful, because you can wreck yourself if you‚Äôre wrong about the underlying.\n\n**Speculation:** LEAPS do not have to be ITM. If you thought back in April 2020 that TSLA would fly above $1,000 by sometime before September 2022, you could have bought the 9/21/2022 $1,000 call strike for about $500 at the time. Today, that contract is worth over $120,000. A $6,000 investment into TSLA LEAPS would be worth about $2,400,000 today. And unlike an FD, you don‚Äôt have to time the purchase perfectly; you‚Äôve got a few years.\n\n**Poor Man‚Äôs Covered Calls:** Poor Man‚Äôs Covered Calls (PMCCs) use LEAPS as collateral to write covered calls instead of blocks of 100 shares. It is not my preferred method of trading covered calls (I prefer the wheel), but PMCCs can be very effective in smaller accounts. I am not going to write up on PMCCs here but they're all over the internet.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIn other words, buy LEAPS when you want to take a larger position than you can normally afford for your risk tolerance and when you want to get rich slowly instead of getting poor quickly.", "id": "idjt0e", "created_utc": 1597960520.0, "score": 349, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 180, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|12|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|415|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rt14u3/cash_in_on_pelosi_and_the_chips_and_fabs_acts/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rt16lu/cash_in_on_pelosi_and_the_chips_and_fabs_acts/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=idjt0e)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=idjt0e)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Please don't ever tell me about a 500$ leap being worth 120k.

I‚Äôd say I have around 22 stocks.\n- Income: very fortunate to be in the $250-$300K range\n\nUp until now, I‚Äôve been fairly safe with my investments and haven‚Äôt made any big bets on any singular stocks, largest position would be about $7-8K (not including ETFs).

However, when I look at my top performing stocks, which were the ones I had the most confidence in buying, I didn‚Äôt make a big purchase and some are +100% all the way up to +700%. Turning 1-2K into 5-10K is nice, but I‚Äôm feeling like I want to *try* and accelerate my net worth faster.\n\nThe TLDR is that I‚Äôm able to save/invest between $60-80K / yr and at this point in my life, if I were to take a $100K position in a single stock that dropped by say, 80%, my life would largely be unaffected (other than slowing my eventual retirement down a bit).

Nadella did a great job overseeing the LinkedIn integration and allowing the site to maintain autonomy and therefore brand strength. TikTok at a $50bn valuation could be a high risk-high reward play. Yes, it‚Äôs currently the platform of choice for Gen Z. But even still, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger all have higher DAUs. And Instagram is seeming to get some folks to try out the copycat Reels feature. If they can hijack users from TikTok as they did with Snapchat, it‚Äôs hard to see TikTok as a highly monetized business in the future. It could still work, but I think tracking Instagram Reels is key. \n\nGaming grew over 60% last quarter, and I do like the focus on a subscription gaming model. Certainly the long-term demand for enterprise SaaS offerings is something that will continue to provide growth. LinkedIn and Surface are both healthy. But should overall revenue growth start to head towards low teens/high single digits, that multiple could contract. \n\nIf Microsoft can become more competitive in edge computing, prove out its AR/VR solutions, or find another rabbit up its sleeve, there‚Äôs no reason they can‚Äôt join Apple in the $2tn club. I personally would feel better buying after a correction, but Nadella is hard to bet against. With the antitrust dynamics, I continue to feel more confident near-term in MSFT than Amazon and Apple (especially). I think Facebook has plenty of room to run long-term for what it‚Äôs worth. And I tend to think at some point the mega cap tech trade driven by passive investing will experience some sort of recalibration. That‚Äôs just me though.

You can even have di-directional movements be profitable, such as the stock could go up, or sideways and you'd still profit if you utilize spreads correctly.\n\nETFs are essentially, you only profit if whatever its tracking goes up, or down if its a short ETF, its a mono-directional win scenario, while with options you can have a tri-situation win scenario, leveraged up all you want, or down, with your risk defined. For example, I could make a 400 dollar play, that S&P goes up 1% in the next month, i would receive 100 dollars if im right. If im wrong, i lose 400 dollars. Risks are defined, im leveraged up 25x, but my risk is rather low and defined. the S&P goes up 1% on average. I could crank it down to 10% return on my capital risked, for .5% increase, giving it some wiggle room.  You could make a similar play, but with a higher risk of capital, and lower return, around 15%, for a play that says S&P will stay the same, or go up within the next month, from this date to that date, if its below the strike that you entered the spread at on expiration, you lose a defined amount. You gave up a % of return on your investment, but you're 2x likely to profit now, because you have 2/3 the movements spy could make on the monthly chart working for you. If you can do this consistently and not lose, it can be amazing returns, 15-25% consistent returns can compound quite quickly, but dont forget, you can get blown up doing this if you're not paying attention, hedging and cutting your losses. S&P could be in that winning condition for that spread all the way up to the last day on your spread, than tank on you.

Their growth seems to be fairly linear and has certainly been peaking recently.\n\nApart from major market dips as the ideal time to buy in most times, it seems like buying many ETFs will be the most positive and safe way to find mid-long term profit huh?

I get you're point about if this is a good time after some have recovered from Covid, but I like to say that it's better to be in the market than not in the market at all. \n\nCompanies are way more risker and volatile compared to ETFs, because you are hoping that an individual company will outperform its competitors, gain revenue, expand, and generally have a bright future. ETFs have multiple holdings as you have probably already done your research. There are some focused primarily on the Technology sector, others on real estate, space, agriculture, mixed ones, and even combinations of every business. The combinations are endless. And pretty much all the ETFs are managed by very successful investors who actually know what they're doing so they are picking these companies for great reasons.

{"title": "NVDA 1000 SOON", "selftext": "Ok, so you know how Apple has been mooning on news of the iPhone 12, and ARM MacBooks, which has totally screwed over INTC and made TSM and other suppliers to AAPL moon?\n\n(Here's the background info in case you missed the news [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS52JigV1CY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS52JigV1CY))\n\nApple was actually approached by Softbank to buy ARM but they couldn't due to ARM licensing stuff out to competitors as well, and Apple obviously has a very private philosophy too so that wouldn't work. But, they will continue to use chipsets based on ARM's architecture for the future macbooks/iphones as well ([https://wccftech.com/apple-shows-disinterest-in-buying-arm-from-softbank/](https://wccftech.com/apple-shows-disinterest-in-buying-arm-from-softbank/)). But if you just follow the money, and try to find out who actually will OWN ARM, the offer has come from none other than Nvidia, and the deal to buy ARM is all but confirmed. (seeck ingalpha.com/article/4370499-chippening-part-2-nvidia-reaches-for-outstretched-arm). And I'm sure that most of you are aware of how AAPL is trying to expand its reach into countries like India for the first time offering first-party stores and an online store, etc. This will only increase their sales numbers, and Apple will only get more bullet proof from hereon. The real story here, is in NVDA.\n\nWhen they do end up buying ARM, the merger will either be seen as A.) a value destroying buy that wasn't worth it or B.) A merger of epic proportions that inserts Nvidia into the mobile and CPU market \"Apple recently indicated it would change their use of Intel chips in Mac computers to custom made ARM-based chips. This is likely due to the desire to include a touch screen and also due to the general efficiency of the design as well as ARM's licensing of its IP to Apple. This could be the start of a major transition for chip usage among desktop computers. Moreover, this technology appears to be competitive for use in data-centers markets.\n\nNVIDIA is not currently a major competitor in the smartphone and tablet business, so acquiring ARM would expand it into new realms where ARM happens to dominate. NVIDIA did previously attempt to compete in this business, but its Tegra chips never got much market share.\"\n\nMost of you already know how durable Nvidia is, but for those of you that don't I'll leave you with these too: Nvidia's R&D expense/gross profit is surprisingly low due to multiple income streams, and although it is increasing (as expected) we can expect gross profits to massively increase too with the world's largest company as its customer. Their Cash per share has grown insanely :\n\nCash Per Share ratio\n\nüì∑\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3wz4otn79j51.png?width=753&format=png&auto=webp&s=501e51a371f0d4ab402a8500a03e14b6e31f86d3\n\nAnd they have low long term debt that has barely increased, but their assets have remarkably increased, which means a low lt debt/asset ratio, just showing you how much of a powerhouse NVDA is.\n\nLT debt/total assets\n\nüì∑\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0hg0zqmo79j51.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2862927faff7933cf9600ae20f76455de0a47ee\n\nNot only that, but along with decreasing/flatlining long term debt, they have a negative cash conversion cycle, which greatly reduces opex. Financially, this is only the beginning of their buildup. Aside from just solid financials for such a revolutionary company, they have revolutionary products. Their cloud services and acquisition of Mellanox will only expand their bases. Nvidia has a vision, and it may be very far-out and hard to accomplish or it may be the most genius thing I've ever seen.

(The new 865 plus is hardly faster than last year‚Äôs overpriced 865) \n\n‚Äî this will be achieved by using TSMC‚Äôs brand new 5nm technology which is gonna be more powerful and more power efficient than people are expecting. \n\n‚Äî TSMC is already working on their 3nm tech that will be going into 2022 iPhones, iPads and Macs. \n\n‚Äî they are gonna implement 5G across their iPhone lineup without raising the prices crazy high like other brands like Samsung are forced to do right now. \n\n‚Äî leaks have shown that the iPhone 12 pro will come with the widely requested 120Hz display and insane camera recording features (4K at 240fps) \n\n‚Äî their Apple silicon chip Macs are gonna be so good and so powerful using TSMC‚Äôs 5nm tech that people‚Äôs minds will be blown. The new features and battery life are gonna be game changers. \n\n‚Äî the transition period to ARM-based chips will be much smoother than people are expecting. \n\n‚Äî these Macs will likely also have models with support for 5G cellular. \n\n‚Äî their new iPads are gonna start getting redesigned with a modern design for the first time in years. While the android tablets aren‚Äôt getting much better. Huge demand upswing. \n\n‚Äî the Apple Watch is gonna support more sensors and features than ever before, and they‚Äôre gonna release a brand new budget model for the first time. \n\n‚Äî Apple is gonna release their brand new services bundles which are gonna be very popular, and we all know that services are where the money is at. \n\n‚Äî Apple is gonna release a new Apple TV which will begin to get marketed as a gaming console. They‚Äôll release a new gaming controller at the same time that will work across all of their Apple devices including the iPhone. \n\n‚Äî Apple will release a HomePod mini to better compete with the Amazon echo and push their Apple Music sales. \n\n‚Äî Apple is gonna begin to switch most of their devices to Mini-LED displays on their devices which will be almost as good as OLED without all of the drawbacks. \n\n‚Äî The stock split is gonna allow a bunch of new investors to get in after they realize all of this is happening. \n\nThose are just a few of the reasons why Apple has even more room to grow within the next year. -Vadim from the Max Tech channel on YouTube. \n\nPositions: wait for correction and dip after stock split.
