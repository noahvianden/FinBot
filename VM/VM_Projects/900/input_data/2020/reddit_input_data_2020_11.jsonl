At the time, the stock price was just over $50 a share. Now, the price is around $80 a share. There are good reasons for that: On a GAAP basis, revenue for the second quarter of this year was up 38% year over year, operating margin was 39%, and earnings per share increased an astounding 74% year over year. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $768 million, and looking back over the past 12 months, the company generated $2.14 billion in operating cash flow. That's pretty good.\nUser engagement is strong. The company had 428 million monthly active users in the third quarter, with 125 million for the Activision segment and 32 million for the Blizzard segment. The other 271 million? Those folks were all playing games produced by King, the social and mobile publisher Activision acquired back in 2016. At this point, we think it's fair to say that acquisition has worked out well.\nWe can put Activision in the category of companies that have seen positive impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic. Many people are stuck at home, with some forms of leisure and entertainment unavailable for the time being. Video gaming is something that is available. Plus, many of Activision Blizzard's franchises offer social engagement to players who can't get it elsewhere. If you can't meet up with your friends at a bar or restaurant, you can jump online with them and run through a Call of Duty: Warzone mission or match up against them in Overwatch.\nThe pandemic won't last forever. We expect, however, that Activision Blizzard will build on its impressive COVID-19-fueled performance from this year and continue to grow its business and reward shareholders. The positive trends in the video game industry aren't going away, and Activision is well positioned to thrive. If you are someone who has enjoyed its games at some point during this year, consider picking up a few shares for your portfolio so you can enjoy being an owner of the company, too.\n\n The Motley Fool thinks buying and holding for at least 3-5 years sets you up for success", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "New Call of Duty this Friday possibly?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "LOL to all the doomer posts before the election!

One can use this information to make investment decisions that may pay off big in several years.\n\nAutonomy day may prove to be an even better example than Battery day.

An investor who can evaluate this information, weigh the probabilities of success/failure, and take action based on this assessment, is positioned for potential gains.\n\nTesla's Investor events should be considered important because they allow shareholders to make long term strategic decisions, not because they might influence markets one way or the other.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "There's speculation that the flashy events are actually to get free media attention (advertising without having to pay for it), and also a recruitment tool to encourage top engineering talent to apply for jobs at Tesla.  \n\nI don't know if this is true.\n\nPersonally, I suspect that a part of it is that Elon Musk just likes parties and gets excited for future products.

That was a very painful lesson to learn for a lot of things not to do.\n\nYour USO contracts are now the adjusted USO1 contracts, correct?

Or even the best-case winning condition -- you might bite off more of a capital outlay than you can swallow and your broker will be merciless in terms of covering their own ass.\n\n* Once a split or other corporate action is announced, get out of the trade as fast as possible, ideally before the effective date of the contract adjustment.

What you want to avoid is paying extra when buying and not getting full value when you are selling. Narrow spreads help those goals, wide spreads work against those goals.\n\nBid/ask sizes just give you an idea of how much demand/supply there is at the moment.\n\nFor your example, it's hard to decide anything without context. What is the spread ATM? What is the spread of nearby strikes? A $1.80 spread might be excellent or terrible, depending.\n\nTrading volume is more useful than bid/ask size, IMO. If there was zero volume at that strike, chances are the spread is terrible. If there was over 1000 trades at that strike and it's near ATM, chances are the spread is as good as it can get.\n\nMore bids than asks can be a clue that there is upward pressure on price. But that is a very iffy indicator. If 90% of the bids are for ridiculous prices, the indicator is weak at best.\n\n> I get the feeling folks don't typically just take the bid or ask - they open a contract for a value they think is reasonable. Am I right about that?\n\nYes. If you take the bid as the seller or the ask as a buyer, it's the other guy that is laughing all the way to the bank. However, when the spread is narrow, like 1.00/1.03, there really isn't much room for anyone to be gouging you on price. It would be fine to take the bid or the ask in that situation.

Example: The \"true\" market value of a contract is $1.05. If the bid/ask is $1.04/$1.06, even if you take the bid or the ask, you are within $0.01 of the optimal value, which is about as good as it can get. But say the spread is $0.24/$1.86.  It is much more likely that the fill you get will be further from the $1.05 ideal than you would like, since the askers will stubbornly demand more money and the bidders will stubbornly refuse to offer more. It's an auction, after all, so they can set whatever price they want. If somebody bids $0.20 and there is no competition to pressure them to a higher number, $0.20 is the best you are going to get if you are selling.\n\n> What I don't get: What the ATM option has to do with it. If the ATM option is seeing lots of volume, but the strike I've chosen is seeing none, why is that any better/worse than if the ATM option is seeing little action?\n\nUsually the ATM strike has the most volume, and so the most active auction with the most active competition to drive price discovery. The point is, find the strike with the most active current trading going on and you'll find the bid/ask with the most accurate price discovery. The more volume, the better.\n\nOnce you have found the \"best\" auction, you can use that as a benchmark for evaluating the bid/ask at the strike you desire. You can't tell if a $3 spread is good or bad unless you have something better to compare against, right?\n\n> If there's little supply & demand for any option, it seems that would mean it's price may not be optimal, regardless of other options in the chain.\n\nTrue. It would depend on total volume for the whole chain. An entire call chain with less than 100 volume total will have terrible spreads for most strikes, so you are right, in that scenario, being slightly less terrible ATM doesn't help much. But, you shouldn't be trading that chain in the first place, right?

The $50 should make more than the $100, and the $100 should make more than the $150, but that's all I can say with what is given. The premium price of a contract isn't a direct/simple relationship to the price of the underlying, unless the contract has expired. If the contract has expired, the value is the underlying price minus the strike price, that's it. So the $50 would have a $150 profit, the $100 would be $100 profit, and the $150 would be $50 profit.

The last column is for when the contract is expired. If Friday is expiration day, the contract has a whole trading day to go through before it expires and all extrinsic value is driven to zero. That's the difference between those two columns. You should read explainers on [gamma](https://theoptionprophet.com/blog/the-complete-guide-on-option-gamma) and [extrinsic value vs. theta decay](https://theoptionprophet.com/blog/the-complete-guide-on-option-theta) for explanations as to why one day can make such a big difference.\n\n> In bull call spreads, once ATM gets closer to my short leg rather than long leg, I make more profit holding it longer even when the price doesn't change at all due to faster premium decay on my short leg, right?\n\nYes, but that's true for any ITM price. If both legs are ITM, the short leg will be closer to the money and therefore have a higher theta.\n\nBut that is not a sufficient reason to hold an ITM spread longer, if it has already met your profit target. You are much more likely to lose money than gain money by holding longer. You **should not plan to hold any option position to expiration**. Don't get hung up on the max profit number of a spread, that is not your profit target and it is impossible to achieve 100% of the time in any case.\n\n* [Risk to reward ratios change: a reason for early exit (Redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hg8ce9/risk_to_reward_ratio_changes_over_the_life_of_an/)\n\n> Should I just close the spread once the stock price hits above short leg?\n\nYou should stick to your exit strategy.

{"title": "Why WSB is now running the entire equity market - Investment Professional here", "selftext": "I am someone who has spent over a decade in finance, first in a hedge fund and then in private equity\n\nIf you want to understand what it is going on. You have to understand that the largest driving force in the background in which you are operating in is the shift from active managers to passive managers. The vanguard crowd has been winning for more than a decade and now we are at a point where nearly all new money entering the market comes in the form of passive ETFs and index funds.\n\nAnd here is where the fun begins. millennials and new investors have a extreme preference for passive management while baby boomers largely invested in active managers. So in the past few years, all new money entering the market is passive and all old money leaving the market is active. Hedge fund and mutual fund managers are shedding AUM while the likes of vanguard and ETFs have been gaining AUM.\n\nSo why does this matter?\n\nWell, the old operating model of securities analysis was predicated on value judgements. If a stock falls 20%, your money manager tasks a analyst to runs a DCF/comps analysis, and tells you it is undervalued by 10% based on the latest assessment, and that the fund should buy some shares. The old buy low sell high with a dash of analysis added in. That was how things use to run anyways. But in the world of passive investing, price becomes the only judgement as to whether it should be added or subtracted, there is no analysis of valuation metrics, fundamentals of the business or even if it is a fraud or not. There are no analysts digging into the company, calling up suppliers, doing channel checks. It is just pure automation, stock goes up, it gets reweighted high, buy. Stock goes down, it gets reweighted down, sell. The market has become dumber over time. And the people who do the work do not get paid for it, because more and more of the market is passive. So undervalued things remain undervalued, and overvalued things get more overvalued.\n\nThere are essentially three players left in this market, of which only two are active investors. You have the passive money, which now drives 90%+ of the market. You have the small remaining active investor base, who have been shedding AUM and are desperate to hold on to their jobs and are forced to actually follow indexes to avoid getting fired, and what their doing which is arbitraging value, no longer pays off. Then you have people like WSB and stocktwits, where people chase momentum in everything from large tech to chinese frauds. What you are seeing today is the two remaining active groups fighting to control the flows of the passive money (who simply follows whichever side has more momentum).\n\nThis is why we are in a world where TESLA can go up valuation by 10x despite revenue only increase by 15%. We are in a world where large cap gets larger. We are in a world where a bunch of degenerates gambling on FDs, which then drives gamma covering by market makers will create an escalating feedback loop in which passive money piles in, making it into a self fulfilling prophecy.\n\nSo thank the Bogleheads, you have the keys to the Asylum. You are now running the trillion dollar global equity markets.

PLTR was to buy for fun.. I just wanted to see what would happen if it hits 40 by next week. Within the same day, it dropped from 3.22 to 0.8 and I knew I messed up.\n2. WORK was a speculative play. I know there's some acquisition coming and I thought that will boost the price up..\n3. FCEL was also another speculation.

It reminded me of \"Richest Man In Babylon\" story of investing in something you actually understand. Obviously I had no idea since Friday was my first time trying out options.

I would like to know specifically what happens or what Robinhood does if the stock ends at let's say $37. And what (if any) mistakes I can make to lose more than my theoretical max loss of $60 (or the debit I paid to open this butterfly)\n\nI have some questions about what happens in a specific situation if I do nothing and let Robinhood (or any broker) exercise my options. I bought a butterfly spread but I believe that this situation can be simplified to a call credit spread, and what happens if the price of the stock is between the two strikes of the spread at expiry.\n\nFor background, I have <$1000 in the account and no other stocks, so that is also why I'm asking, because I don't know if I need enough money in my account to cover the situation where I may need to buy back the shares manually.\n\n\n$PLTR 12/24\n\n1 x $30 call buy  at $4.60\n\n2 x $35 call sold at $3.23\n\n1 x $40 call buy  at $2.46\n\nnets me **$0.60** debit\n\nSo I spent $60 to make a total of $440.\n\n\nMy understanding is that if I just let this ride all the way to expiration, and say Robinhood does not close my position for some reason.\n\n* At $29, everything is worthless and I lose ($60)\n\n* At $33, the two middle and top are worthless and I make $3x100 - $60 so I profit $240\n\n* At $35, I assume the two middle and top are still worthless and I max profit $5x100 - ($60) = $440\n\n* At $42, everything is in the money Robinhood will exercise everything and I don't have to manually do anything, it will exercise my two buys and give them to my two sells and I lose ($60).\n\n\nThe part that confuses me is if the price is say $37, then bottom and middles are in the money. I assume Robinhood will exercise my lower call and I then have 100 shares at $30, and it will sell those shares to one of my sold calls at $35 so I net $500. But now I'm on the hook for another 100 shares that i need to sell at $35, with only $500 from that first trade. Do I then have to *manually* go buy 100 shares at $37 ($3700) really quickly and sell to them at $35 and then lose $200?

No broker does. You should control your own trades and close before expiration.\n\nThe question of what RH will or won't do can be totally avoided, if you just close the position before expiration. Much simpler and much less risky. Don't get hung up on max profit, nobody gets that every time. Shoot for a lower amount with less risk. The Exit Guide above doesn't have an entry for long call flies, but you can interpolate from the bull and bear debit vertical spreads, which all say 50% or more of the max profit. So you should be shooting for a gain of $220.\n\nIn the disaster scenario you are imagining, if say you fell into a coma and couldn't close the position before expiration, RH will either close the entire fly for a loss, or will close the short calls for a loss and maybe close the lower long call, if you are lucky. The higher long call is worthless so RH won't do anything with it. RH can see that you are broke, so it they probably won't allow you to get into an assignment/exercise situation. Again, **you can avoid all of this worry by closing the fly yourself before expiration**.\n\nIt's worth noting that PLTR is a volatile stock with no predictable trading range and butterflies prefer stocks that stay in a predictable trading range.

If you're selling a put or call you want the options to become as close to worthless as possible so you collect the max of the premium. So for a cash secured put you'd want the stock to move up away from your strike price and you want to get to your expiry date. You would also want the volume of trading for your options to lower.  This all effects the options value. You don't get the full value of the premium until the option expires OTM, but plenty of people will buy to close a put or call if they will make 30-50% of the premium, and move on to the next option to sell. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor example: You sell a CSP at a strike of $20with 30 DTE and the underlying is $30.

At that point you may want to either: 1) wait to the expiration date.
