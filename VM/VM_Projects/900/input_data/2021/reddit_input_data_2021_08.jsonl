{"title": "The Coming Crisis.", "selftext": "**TL;DR at bottom.**\n\nHere's your obligatory bear post for the day/week/whatever.\n\nI'm not an expert but I do have some qualifications that lead me to believe that the global economy is in for some trouble.  I could be wrong, of course, and actually my entire theory is predicated on that fact.  Still, I feel I am sure enough in my convictions to the point where this statement is worth making.  You may disagree with the worthiness of this post, and of course, the premise behind it.  That's fine;  I'm just here to share the way I see things.\n\nWhat's certain is that, even if one may see the warning signs of a looming crisis, it's near impossible to tell when that crisis might be.  I have no idea.  All I know is I see some precariousness and warning signs right now.  So, without further ado:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Uncertain Nature of the World**\n\nThe world is uncertain.  Black swan events happen, and they happen frequently.  Again, some people may have some inkling of them, but it's hard if not impossible to predict these things with any degree of certainty.  Some examples that come to mind (please excuse the lack of chronological ordering): the Covid-19 pandemic, September 11th, the Global Financial Crisis, the John F. Kennedy assassination, Columbus discovering America, the Challenger/Colombia space shuttle disasters, the assassination of Franz Ferdinand leading to WW1, the Great Depression, the Black Death, the storm that destroyed the Spanish Armada, the Wehrmacht crossing the Ardennes, the smart phone / internet revolution, etc.  The last one is interesting if you ever saw *Back to the Future: Pt. 2.*  The most they predicted were flying cars, but not smart phones or internet.\n\nBut I digress.  These events are part and parcel of life, and the major events of history do not happen in a linear fashion.  Sure, we may be able to connect the dots after the fact, but when they happen it's almost unbelievable: we seem to be taken utterly by surprise.  Just think: apart from Bill Gates or someone like that, which one of us normal folk thought we'd be dealing with a pandemic this time 2 years ago?  I certainly didn't imagine it.\n\nAnd it happens in our personal lives too.  You meet someone.  You have a break up.  You get injured.  You get sick.  You lose a loved one.  You fall in love.  Who knows?  Life is very, very unpredictable.\n\nDon't get me wrong; that doesn't mean I don't think we should try.  Science helps. We can form hypotheses and test them.  This adds a lot of certainty to a world that is very uncertain.  But even Einstein would admit that some things are simply out of our grasp:\n\n\"What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly, and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of humility.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Folly of Economics**\n\nI studied economics.  I was very interested in Econ 101 and decided to make that my major.  Later, however, I was disappointed in what I learned.  I don't know.  There was just too much mathematical formulating and analysis.  I didn't feel, really, that I had learned much of anything that was actually relevant and applicable to the real world.  To be honest, at the time I just thought I was an idiot and bad at math, blaming myself rather than the field (as a young, lost kid might be prone to do).  Looking back, however, I think there were serious shortcomings that I had picked up on but did not have the tools to express.\n\nI'm not saying that there isn't a place for that sort of analysis in the study of economics: I imagine there is.  I just don't think that it should be the singular focus of the whole field.  Indeed, while mathematical equations are imperative for pure math and even for practical applications like physics and chemistry, can they really be applied with the same rigorous veracity to the study of something so complex and changeable as the economy?\n\nFormer economic advisor at the Bank of International Settlements William White argues that instead of looking at the economy through equations and equilibria, we should be viewing the economy as a [complex adaptive system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system#:~:text=A%20complex%20adaptive%20system%20is,the%20behavior%20of%20the%20components.&text=The%20Complex%20Adaptive%20Systems%20approach%20builds%20on%20replicator%20dynamics).  You know, like a garden.  You have an idea in mind of what you want to plant and where, but some plants die, some don't, weeds pop up, there might be an infestation.  The whole thing is quite unpredictable because it depends on an enormous amount of variables interacting with each other.  Well, that's a lot like the economy.  (Read more here: [Recognizing the Economy as a Complex, Adaptive System: Implications for Central Banks](https://williamwhite.ca/2018/04/22/recognizing-the-economy-as-a-complex-adaptive-system-implications-for-central-banks/))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The Folly of Modern Central Banking**\n\nThe folly here follows naturally from the aforementioned ontological error in the field of economics: we think the economy is predictable and controlable.  Cut interest rates here, buy assets there, and we're good to go.  If only it were that simple.\n\nLook at the data we're looking at right now.  Despite absolutely unprecedented amounts of liquidity being pumped by the Federal Reserve (and by other central banks around the world), we're still unable to get people back to work.  Check out the [ADP numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/04/private-companies-added-330000-jobs-in-july-according-to-adp-far-short-of-the-653000-estimate.html) today: 653,000 new positions were expected in July, but the actual result was a miss by just over half (330,000).  If you've been paying attention to the data in past months as well, you've noticed consistent misses in employment.  And how about inflation?  YoY inflation hikes are expected due to base effects from the pandemic last year, but MoM inflation has been coming in consistently higher than expected.  All of this makes you wonder: does the Fed really have things under control?  *Could* they have things under control?\n\nI would argue that you can't solve structural employment issues by throwing liquidity at the markets.  The problem is not liquidity, there's plenty of it: the problem is structural mismatches, as well as other factors like people preferring to take extended unemployment rather than working.  You can't fix that with more liquidity.  One of the most respected modern economists, Paul Krugman, would probably say \"well, it can't hurt\".  And according to their models, it can't.  Unfortunately economists and central bankers seem to do be doing their absolute best to turn a blind eye to obvious asset bubbles.  SPX is up nearly 48% since pandemic lows less than 18 months ago, while the Nasdaq is up nearly 58% in the same period. Meanwhile the real economy has been absolutely hammered.  The [Shiller PE ratio](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe) is at 38.25 at time of writing - a level unseen since prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble.  It is clear that there is a severe disconnect between fundamentals and asset prices due to excessive liquidity in the system.\n\nIf the Fed manages a controlled walk down of interest rates, and earnings continue to grow into current valuations, then no problem, right?  Right.  It's possible.  But that would be hoping for the best.  William White argues that it's more rational to prepare for the worst rather than naively hoping for the best.  A long series of things would have to go according to plan for this bubble to be \"defused\", and any number of unforeseen events could arise in order to knock the whole plan off track.  Some examples come to mind (and these are just the ones that we can fathom... the whole point is that there are more that we probably can't): Delta variant or other Covid-related scares, geopolitical tensions with China/USA/Taiwan, inflation running hotter than expected, etc.\n\nAnd speaking of inflation, why in the world is the Federal Reserve so confident that inflation is transitory?  As I mentioned above, YoY and MoM inflation expectations have come in consistently higher than expectations over the course of the last few months, oftentimes to the tune of 70-80%.  If whoever is making these predictions is getting it so wrong in regards to the numbers, who's to say that they aren't getting it wrong in regards to it being transitory?\n\nLook, it very well may be: the supply chain disruption argument is a valid and strong one.  But nobody has a crystal ball. The Fed is not an all-seeing eye where they can simply predict exactly what is going to happen.  One might hope that the Fed would be more prudent and humble in their analysis of the situation.\n\nAnd certainly the Fed has a long history of getting things wrong.  In early 2007 Ben Bernanke famously declared that subprime was \"contained\".  Just a few months later, when the crisis did begin to arise, Jim Cramer called out Bernanke for \"being an academic\" and for being out of touch with the situation on the ground.  Look, I don't really like Cramer, but I do believe he was in the right at this particular moment.  This sub won't allow me to link it here, but I recommend looking up \"Cramer tells Bernanke to wake up\" on YouTube.  It's worth a watch.\n\nLet's not forget either that even before these two events the Fed absolutely failed to anticipate the crisis in the first place.  Later they would say that such a crisis was unpredictable, and totally based on panic.  But they forget the fact that people like Dr. Michael Burry, of Big Short book and film fame, did see it coming.  All of the people in that book saw it coming.  Even [William White saw it coming, and warned Alan Greenspan of it at Jackson Hole in 2003.](https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/the-man-nobody-wanted-to-hear-global-banking-economist-warned-of-coming-crisis-a-635051.html) The Fed, however, did not see it coming.  Bernanke would also claim that the crisis was nothing more than old-fashioned financial panic, and that if not for the panic it would have been the equivalent of merely \"a bad day in the stock market\".  This is a convenient view for him to take, as it alleviates him of all responsibility for completely bungling the situation.  Even [Paul Krugman challenges Bernanke's assertion that it was all related to financial panic and not at all tied to fundamentals in the housing market](https://www.google.com/search?q=Paul+Krugman+Great+recession+bernanke&oq=paul+krugman+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j69i59l3j35i39j69i60l3.2811j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).\n\nOf course, Bernanke and those around him would hold on to their view that nobody could have seen the crisis coming, and go on to congratulate themselves for rescuing the country and the world from a crisis that they themselves had failed to prevent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Where We Are Today**\n\nAnd that brings us to where we are today, with massive monetary stimulus coming from the Fed and all major central banks as a response to the Covid-19 crisis.  The response to 2008 was seen, rightfully in many ways, as a success.  By injecting liquidity into markets when they needed it most, the Fed and other central banks were able to stave off the next Great Depression.  Unfortunately, however, apart from their failure to prevent the crisis in the first place, central banks have also failed to take into account the limitations of their policies.  Not only have their policies become less effective, but they've also opened the door for a dangerous array of unintended consequences (William White talks about both issues [here](https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2012/0126.pdf)).  William White also says that, contrary to what the Fed seems to believe, monetary policy \"is no free lunch\".\n\nRecovery since 2008 has been asymmetric: we seem to be trying to fix deep, structural problems via simple injections of liquidity. Meanwhile, [inequality grows](https://hbr.org/2018/09/research-how-the-financial-crisis-drastically-increased-wealth-inequality-in-the-u-s), the poor get poorer, and political and social unrest continue to grow as a result.  It's a dangerous path to go down, and rather than try to explain it myself, I would recommend reading the White paper I linked above.  One clear and present danger I see today, which White mentioned in the paper, is the presence of serial bubbles: the dot-com bubble led to the housing bubble, and the housing bubble has led to the current stock market bubble, only to be aggravated by the Covid crisis and the Fed's response to it (ironically causing a new bubble in the housing market as well).  If something unforeseen were to happen, these bubbles could pop, causing lasting damage to Main Street.\n\nAnother issue I see now is that, if we were to have another crisis, what more could be done?  How much higher can the Fed expand their balance sheet?  How much more deficit spending can the federal government engage in?  I believe that we are dangerously close to exhausting our policy options.\n\nIf everything goes according to plan, it's possible that everything works out just fine.  The issue, however, may be in assuming that everything will go according to plan.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What To Do as an Investor**\n\nI'm not an expert at this, but I would not tell anyone to go cash right now.  I would say, however, that it may be wise to hold a larger cash percentage than you're normally accustomed to.  If you normally hold 5% in your portfolio, for example, then maybe you'd consider holding 10-15%.  This will provide for buying opportunities in the event that we do have a major correction, and it will also help to preserve capital.  That said, full cash does not seem to be the way to go.  If you're waiting for a crash, you may be waiting forever.\n\nWhat I would recommend, and this seems pertinent to a lot of what I see on this subreddit, is diversification.  I see people with dangerous allocations into overvalued tech stocks (\"buy Microsoft at any valuation\"), holding 3-4 tech stocks as their whole portfolio, a 2-fund portfolio with levered funds UPRO and TQQQ, etc.  I see people holding large allocations of ARK funds and other \"disruptive\" tech with unproven track records.  I see people recommending lump sums right now, because, \"on average\", they do better.\n\nIf it were me, I would diversify and play it more conservatively.  VOO would be infinitely better than UPRO, for example.  A diversified portfolio of blue-chips which very well may (and should) include stocks like Microsoft would be infinitely better than *only* holding Microsoft.  Patient dollar cost averaging would probably be wiser than dumping one's life savings into an S+P 500 index fund at the moment.\n\nI would also encourage people to look at fundamentals.  One should never, IMO, feel the urge to pay for a stock at 30, 35, or 50+ times earnings just because of \"future growth potential\".  It's a gamble.\n\nIn the end, all of these strategies that I am opposed to may end up working out and may even end up doing better than my conservative approach.  The problem, however, is what happens if they don't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR, Summary, and Final Thoughts**\n\nAs humans we seem to have a problem with humility.  In some ways I think it's painful for us to accept our limitations and fragility.  Thus, it's easier for us to pretend that the world is predictable, orderly, and within our control.  This fallacy has made it's way into the field of economics and by extension into central banks and the Federal Reserve.  Current policies, encouraged by the \"success\" of 2008, operate under the fallacy that the economy is orderly and able to be controlled with surgical precision, rather than accepting the unpredictability of the economy as a complex adaptive system and taking measures to be prepared for black swan events which will inevitably occur.\n\nAs a society and as investors, we can certainly hope for the best, and sometimes the best does manifest itself, and in those cases such optimism does tend to lead to better outcomes for those who profess it.  However, perhaps a more prudent, realistic approach would be to prepare for the worst, or at the very least recognize our limitations and put measures in place in order to mitigate the damage which can be caused by unforeseen disruptive events.\n\nGood luck and best wishes to all.", "id": "oy57s2", "created_utc": 1628120007.0, "score": 1178, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 843, "comments": [{"body": "I see it coming but I can’t see it coming, type of way", "score": 640, "replies": [{"body": "I think the idea is that it *could* happen, which is more honest than the people saying that it won't and can't.

I intended for the message to be deeper.\n\nIn my experience with humans, first and foremost with myself, I have found that we have a tendency to hold on to ideas about ourselves and the world that may not necessarily reflect the reality.  That's why some people (not necessarily you) think I'm just some intellectual try-hard when really my only intention was to share something I enjoy talking about and think is important.  Their notion of me (intellectual try-hard) serves their limited world view, but it's not reflective of the reality of what's going on.  If they were open to a conversation with me like you are, they would potentially be able to see how they're wrong about me.\n\nI'm not saying that means they have to agree with me.  It just means that they might be forced to admit that, \"Ok, I don't necessarily agree, but I see where he's coming from\".\n\nThe same thing happened with Trump voters, which has been talked about elsewhere in this thread.  Progressives generally thought (and some still think) that Trump voters are just idiots who need to get their act together.  Now, I'm far from a Trump supporter, but the truth is that these people had actual grievances that for some odd reason felt that Trump was going to address better than any of the other options.  The limited, false world view is \"wow they're dumb\".  The more complex, humble view which is reflective of reality is \"well, they may have dumb solutions, but they know their grievances better than I, and they have them for a reason\".\n\nIt's the same flawed thinking that tells us \"Wow she's such a bitch\" when maybe she just had a bad day and couldn't hold it in anymore.  Boiling it down to simple terms like \"she's a bitch\" is a closed, overly simplistic view of a phenomenon that's much more complex than that.\n\nThe thing is, our closed world view tends to be more comfortable than an open-ended one that is more reflective of reality.  Why? It gives us something to cling to.  As human beings we don't like uncertainty.  It's scary.  It means we know a lot less than we think we do, and are a lot more vulnerable than we think we are.  We could have an aneurysm, we could die in a car crash, the Delta variant or some other disease could cause Covid pt. 2.  It's scary to admit that, so it's much easier to just boil things down to some overly simplistic way of viewing things.\n\nI had my notions challenged at a young age because my life was really on a bad path, and it was either challenge my notions and get humbled, or end up jail or dead or something.  It was that bad (drugs and alcohol related).  Life humbled me.  That's why I'm able to see lack of humility and guardedness in others.\n\nWhat I see, actually, is lack of humility and closed-mindedness in economic thinkers and the Fed.  And that lack of humility and closed-mindedness are dangerous ingredients that can lead to a crisis, just as they did in 2008.  \"Nobody could have seen it coming\", they said, but truthfully that's just because none of them were really paying attention.  They were too stuck in their own limited and incomplete world view.\n\nMaybe this was the wrong sub for this, but I'm constantly trying to find new platforms to communicate these ideas, and truth be told they permeate all aspects of our culture and society.  So really many forums are appropriate, including this one.  While admittedly the surface level advice of \"be careful and diversify\" may not be all that profound, I think there's a deeper message in here worth considering.  It's sound financial advice, IMO, but also sound life advice.\n\nYou may disagree, but these are my honest thoughts, and it's certainly far beyond \"trying to sound smart\" as others have said (again, not you).

This makes a lot more sense to me.  FWIW, I think it's absolutely relevant.  I'm not sure how I feel about this idea in particular, but where I can agree with is that there does seem to be \"something\" there which we can't comprehend.  I had a bad run growing up and ended up getting sober in Alcoholics Anonymous at age 22.  There we learned to rely on a \"Higher Power\" to help us stay sober and live a good life.  I have no idea what that \"Higher Power\" is, whether natural or supernatural, but what I do know is that there's something mysterious and beautiful there which is worth paying attention to.\n\nI think science has reached a point where they try to understand things which can't be understood, and in the process lost something truly fundamental.  Like why we fall in love, or why a scene from a movie makes us cry.

The recovery is uneven  and impacted by government doing what it *should* be doing, which is looking out for it's citizens in a time where through no fault of their own they cannot look after themselves.  Employment rocketed up over the last few months but the US economy had been exploiting the shit out of minimum wage workers who have suddenly realized that they don't have to take it anymore.

Another example is that containers are stuck in depots because they were not shipped back in early 2020, leading to a container shortage in the supply companies and causing rates for containers to spike. 10x normal container prices won't last forever, and neither will rental companies not selling cars into the used market.

Unless you believe that used cars will stay as scarce as now, and that transport issues won't be resolved, then you think that inflation will not continue at its present rate even if you don't realize it. I Inflation was around 0% last years. Because it compounds, to stay on the 10 year trend line it would have to be around 6% for the year, which seems unlikely at this point.\n\nSo you seem to agree that the economy is a CAS, but now you are claiming that inflation is definitely transitory.  Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  How do you know?  Especially given the fact that, as you said, this is an extremely complicated situation which we've never experienced before.\n\nI don't live in the US and am aware that the pandemic is not over.

Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  How do you know?  Especially given the fact that, as you said, this is an extremely complicated situation which we've never experienced before.\n\nI admit I could be wrong. To clarify that by \"transitory inflation\" I, and most others talking about it, actually mean \"transitory rate of inflation increases\". I expect rate of inflation to look between 2 and 2.5 over a decade that includes 2020/2021.\n\nThe reason I'm so confident is that the the reasons for the current rate of inflation are fairly obvious right now, and they are all transitory themselves. The used car situation is based almost entirely on the total lack of fleet car purchases, something that will almost certainly not occur again. And this is one of the largest contributors to the inflation rate increase.\n\nOther causes include the container problem and the supply chain issues caused by the pandemic. It might take a while to sort these out, but they *will* be sorted out, which will drive shipping costs back down, removing this from the calculation. I don't see any specific structural reasons that would lead to a long term 5% rate of inflation for instance.\n\nThe discussion on this topic has been driven by dramatic YOY and MOM increases, but YOY comparisons are useless because of base effects (take the 2019-2021 rate and average it over 2 years, and you'll see what I mean) and MOM effects are distorted by reopening effects.\n\n>I don't live in the US and am aware that the pandemic is not over.  As for them missing the data, one would expect them to miss sometimes on the downside, rather than consistently on the upside IMO.\n\nI did not actually say you were from the US! Because the conversation on this board has been driven by large increases in the US rate of inflation and because rate of inflation increases were less pronounced in Europe and Canada it seemed a reasonable assumption that we were discussing the US economy. In my opinion the reason they have consistently missed on the downside is because they don't like what their numbers are telling them so adjusted down, and because they did not anticipate how frothy the used car and construction markets would get, and because analysts continue to underestimate the appetite from people to spend money after being constrained for so long.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You make very fair points all around, and you may well be right.

The Fed seems to be hoping for the best rather than making any preparations for the worst.\n\nI understand your opinion about things being frothier than analysts expected, but to my eyes that's actually somewhat of a compelling case that hey, maybe we don't really have this thing under control.

So\none way that I follow the advice in your username is not to put all of my eggs in one basket by also investing heavily in tech.\n\nOn valuations, that was my ballpark estimate for big Tech.  I looked the numbers up just now and feel really good about them.   Here are the forward/trailing P/E’s for these companies:\n\nAMZN   59/58\nAAPL    26/29\nGOOG  30/31\nMSFT   32/36\nFB         28/26\nNFLX    50/54\n\nThis averages to 38, without even including smaller and less mature growth tech.  Much less Tesla.\n\nAnd I personally believe that those P/E’s are based on optimistically flawed macro assumptions, for reasons OP touched on.  \n\nI understand that P/E isn’t the only measure of value and can even be a dangerous one (clearly $ZIM’s 2021 P/E of under 2 is not sustainable).\n\nBut it pretty much boils down to what you’re paying for a combination of sustainable earnings and growth potential.\n\nI know these are considered the best and most revolutionary businesses ever.  But I also know that the same thing has been said about most of the biggest businesses in history.  It was definitely said of Cisco in 1999, but also of IBM and GE and GM and Standard Oil and the Pennsylvania Railroad.  I majored in the history of technology, I’ve always been interested in this phenomenon.\n\nThis week I have been reading David McCullough’s history of the Panama Canal.   \n\nThe French Suez and Panama Canal companies were each by far the biggest IPO’s in history. The same guy, Ferdinand de Lesseps, was the CEO both times.  The Suez was a legendary success, the Panama an abject failure.  A total loss for shareholders, who were still much better off than the perhaps 20,000 employees who died of malaria and yellow fever. \n\nThe French capital raises for the Panama Canal project in the 1880’s remind me a great deal of recent going’s on\n\nWe especially hear how it’s different this time late in each business cycle.  And we are very late in this cycle.  I believe we are in the 12th year of it, from the stock market POV, because 2020 only produced a tiny blip and it was off to the races again.\n\n$SPX has returned over 18% CAGR since the 2009 bottom.  The highest ever *rolling* 10 year nominal return is about 20%, and that was in a little higher inflation regime than we had in the 2010’s, along with much higher interest rates.  Thus I would posit that overall in the last 12 years we have seen the highest 10-year equity risk premium in history.  And roughly tied for the highest ever real returns.\n\nAnd that’s using $SPX.  The Nasdaq 100 has been considerably better.  Meanwhile small caps are much more overvalued than big tech, with a higher P/E ratio.  A fair number of straight up zombies litter $IWM.\n\nI could go on for hours honestly.

Renewables did a decade ago. Now there are fairly mature revenue generating companies (FSLR off top of my head). \n\nI think with big tech, it's had those growing pains already. MSFT AAPL especially came back from the dead after that that bust. These are no Cisco. That died basically. Or Standard Oil. Or GM (which I think is reinventing itself nicely, but that's another story). Or INTC (which is dying...). AAPL MSFT AMZN especially have huge dominating services across industries, own Washington and continue to curb any attempt at serious regulation, and continue to create and recreate entirely new industries. Especially with huge profit margins, sticky revenue streams, and TAM that continue to multiply as they suck in every other industry in existence (I'm not kidding: AMZN created and still owns the cloud, and that's not an easy yoke to throw off for clients. MSFT has bought out gaming, AAPL into cars, which may or may not be good idea, and services like banking and chip design). They are in part infrastructure companies, too. They can't fail. Or the increasingly digitized economy fails. One Google outage cost the world billions. For all of that, I'm happy to pay the multiples you put out. They're peanuts. AAPL also has enough cash on hand and the acumen to spend it wisely that the Swiss Central Bank bought millions worth during covid crash (it was huge).

VIAC F GM all have cheap valuations and I like them, but they're still value stocks for a reason: they've yet to turn from legacy businesses into multi-revenue stream and service empires. So you do get what you pay for. It's a good bet to make, though.\n\nIf you're concerned about valuations broadly, though, you also need to consider interest rates. Both Schiller and Buffett have talked about how given persistent low interest rates in the developed world, the equity premium right now is, well, not a premium. They're the only way to generate returns. And may well remain so. As such, equities are cheap. Schiller PE model doesn't account for sustained difference in monetary policy coordinated globally. \n\nI also think that while yes, SP 500 is overvalued based on historical basis, it can also be the case that someting like AAPL is not. Also, again, I'm happy to pay the multiples MSFT and AAPL carry for what they are. Those two especially. Rotaion in SP 500 continues to happen daily behind the scenes: from retail back to tech and so on. All depending on current mood of market, and so the overall PE stays high while some sectors come down in value and others go up. It's not all a straight line up.\n\nHere's a guy that's been consistently correct for the past two years on valuations and overall market behavior. He's spot on about the numbers.

Then I look at all the sovereign debt that is still yielding an above zero return like the 10year US-treasury bond and how it went from 1.7% to 1.2% in a couple of weeks basically. I look at the amount of money that is entering the system and if you put everything together, you end up with one question: where does all the money go once we enter the situation that no matter what you do, you have to pay someone else to hold your money? And in many countries, for many investment vehicles we are at that point. You have to ask yourself: would you rather pay someone 1% per year to hold your money or would you rather invest it into solid equities with a PE of 100. No one should invest into something with a PE of 100. But a PE of 100 essentially means 1% expected return p.a. which is > than paying 1% p.a. This whole situation is so absurd but it is happening as we speak and it is not going to turn around soon. So the real questions you got to ask yourself is\n\na) where does all the money go and\n\nb) how long will we have this situation where debt is essentially useless as investment. A solid 1% expected return on the S&P500 is way better than making 0% a year or even losing 1%. And the S&P500 allocation is at least somewhat protected from inflation. Money is flowing into TIPS as well so that yield is going to go to zero too, its already happening! Then another vehicle is essentially gone and the supply of money is increasing still.\n\nSo yeah, stocks are definitely very expensive historically, but when investing you want to look what's ahead of you and not what's behind you. And ahead of us is more of the same we have now. How long will this go? Because however long this may last, macro will stay the same and equities will keep going up. They can go up a lot more. Nasdaq can be 30,000 in 2 year no problem. It can be 45,000 in 5 years no problem. It could be 20,000 in 10 years so about 3% p.a. still way, way better than 0% yielding debt. I am not saying it is probably happening, nor am I saying it is improbable. I am saying that for current and future market conditions, equities and almost everything else is cheap. It wont be cheap if we apply 1960 or pre 2008 macro conditions for sure. Most valuations are so high they wouldnt be considered cheap even if they fell 75%. But then again, we dont look backwards. It is extremely tough right now. Holding cash is good but you have to consider the possibility that over the next 10 years nothing is changing and its not really about losing 1% p.a. on holding negative yielding debt; its about the opportunity cost and the fact that the cost of cashflow over the last 2 years was inflating 15-20% p.a. I mean that is crazy. Its absolutely nuts. Holding too much cash would essentially turn the little return on the rest of your portfolio to zero, meaning you would end up with creating zero wealth for the years to come. This is probably fine if you are 60 and want to play it safe. But if you are a young individual that is in his primary earning years and who wants to take risk this is a nightmare.\n\nThe best that could happen now for the long run I think is a massive crisis that completely resets the system. This would probably be very bad for many people over the coming years but at least it would at some point allow most of us to start over and build wealth in the long run. This situation now is unacceptable. The equity risk premium is going to come down a lot and I mean a lot more. We are at about 5-6% now depends on where you look at.

{"title": "Ecovyst: Get rich from this special dividend", "selftext": "Hey retards, here's a special dividend play for a special boy.\n\nEcovyst! This play will make you SO RICH you can finally fuck some strippers to satisfy yourself since your wife won’t.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEcovyst (ECVT) just announced a special dividend of $3.2/share, which at a share price of $16.2 is OVER a 20% return! Now I am not here to talk about a boomer 20% return, but more so how this news has not been priced into the stock/options and provides a perfect short-term options play\n\nOver the past few days ECVT has traded relatively flat, only really increasing over the past day or so. News of this insane dividend has barely made any headlines and no one seems to know about it. Once more people find out about this stock and buy in for that 20% return, the price will EXPLODE\n\nSince the announcement of the dividend, the stock has ONLY increased by 8 cents\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f183uk9eajg71.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8e0709dc16b2dddb9d7e9256dcd6c3cadb1ac4e\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe stock ‘should’ drop around $3.2 after the ex. dividend date (efficient market hypothesis) which ‘should’ mean people won’t buy in just for the dividend, but people (and the market in general) are irrational and greedy so stocks generally have run-ups prior to special dividends (see price action on RKT, MCFE, AFG, SUTL ect.)\n\nSpecial dividends also signify to the market that the company is being successful\n\nIn addition to this, the stock has low liquidity with an average trading volume of only around 223,000 shares and an institutional ownership of OVER 69%. This means the stock will MOON if only a small amount of people buy in\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBesides the whole special dividend play, ECVT is actually a decent, profitable growth company. Y/Y revenues were up 47% and they posted a profitable quarter of $0.11/share. They manufacture and catalyze chemicals for green tech, which will be a growing industry in the future. I know this play is not about the viability of the company, but this being a decent company takes some of the risk away\n\nAdditionally, options have not priced in ANY pre-dividend volatility, the 8/20 $15C only needs to have the stock go up 0.92% to make money\n\nThe ex. Dividend date for the special dividend is aftermarket 8/11 so I would sell before then\n\nThe record date is on the 12th, so if you are feeling risky you could hold until 8/12\n\nMy positions:\n\n10 8/20 $15 C, 10 8/20 $17.5 C\n\nTLDR:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/574x9fncajg71.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b796c0334badd7a240741e16803395b45f7870f\n\nEdit: Turns out the ex div date was in the morning of 8/11 so I wish everyone luck, hope this doesn't fuck up the play", "id": "p1p0rx", "created_utc": 1628601589.0, "score": 1589, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 807, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|8|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|587|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Should have logged in earlier.

Both have two fundamental assumptions that are fatally flawed:\n\n1. All stakeholders involved are fully informed of all the facts.\n2. All stakeholders act rationally.\n\nThere is another fundamental flow in your argument: you presume that inequality in and off itself is bad, and wealth should be redistributed just because it is \"disproportionate\". I suppose you would ask a school administration to more equitably distribute the grades just cuz the students get disproportionately varying scores!\n\nPS: Don't you think these types of unsustainable \"solutions\" seem too juvenile? It's like a bunch of kids are playing at life, and they impulsively try different impractical solutions that don't solve the original problem, while proliferating more and more problems!

Hitler is no different to previous leaders who use war and expansionism to achieve their egoist goals. \n\nDemocracy is the best system that exists for maintaining a non-violent cohesive society. At the end of the day humans want control over their lives and democracy presents the best balance of personal autonomy and collective benefit. You are correct that Democracy is like the Free Market but for governance rather than trade. \n\nThe Free Market does not require all stakeholders to be fully informed or to act 'rationally'. The point is that there is no 'base truth'. Humans reach it through consensus of all human actions, this is why the Free Market is more efficient than a planned economy. \n\nAt the end of the day, humans form collective groups. These groups must have a hierarchy of some kind. People at the top have 'more' than people at the bottom. Humans will evolve over time, through the force of natural selection, more efficient organisational structures. The modern 'cancel culture' is a perfect example of an attempt of those who feel they are at the bottom to reorganise the hierarchy so that they may increase their social status. This shit never changes.\n\nI never said inequality is bad, it is a feature, not a bug. To have no inequality would be communism. That doesn't work. The point is that it is impossible to have an unbridled capitalist system because it is by nature fragile. There is an optimum redistribution amount to keep everyone happy yet still allow innovation and hard work to generate the ideas that progress humanity. The question is how much do we re-distribute.

Tesla is also moving their SR+ in the USA to LFP.\n\nBased on my calculations (and some data from Troy):\n\n* Tesla produces \\~20k Model 3 SR+ in Fremont per quarter. This is equivalent to \\~14k LR packs.\n* Shanghai produced \\~ 16k in their first quarter for both M3 and MY.\n* Tesla produced \\~106k 3/Y in Fremont in Q2. Their stated capacity is \\~125k.\n* They are also building an additional tent line outside. This might increase their capacity to \\~140-150k.\n* Panasonic is increasing Nevada output by \\~3GWh (\\~8%), which is meant to be coming online during Q3. This is enough for \\~35k LR vehicles.\n\nSo Tesla should have enough cylindrical cells to increase production by \\~50k within the next 6 months. This matches their increase in production roughly between Fremont and Texas' first quarter.\n\nThe problem that I am seeing is that if the 4680 is say still \\~ a year from real production (and at this point the Cybertruck will need the cells), there definitely won't be enough battery cells available to feed Texas/Berlin much past their first quarter of production. Tesla might see an increase in cells from LG as well, but I just don't think it will be enough. I think CATL is able to scale LFP production faster than LG/Panasonic can scale NCA/NMC because of materials. If Tesla can move more of their products to LFP they can increase sales in the medium term.\n\nTherefore, we might see a Fremont LFP Model Y SR+ with \\~280 miles of EPA range coming out soon. Tesla could then probably ramp Texas/Berlin very quickly using a combination of LFP SR+ production and NCA/NMC LR production. Tesla could then slowly substitute in 4680 packs.\n\nRemember that Elon said they have doubled battery orders by 2x for 2022 vs 2021.

He wrote that the \"trend\" of unvaccinated people becoming the majority of new seriously ill patients is continuing, and said that on Monday, over 50 percent of the new patients in serious condition were unvaccinated\n\nI think the Delta variant had a huge effect on both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, but over time the data is becoming more clear.  50% of new infections are coming from the 20% of unvaccinated people in the country.  Additionally, Israel was basically the first nation to achieve a level of mass vaccination early on in the pandemic.  By March 2021, they had 50% of their population vaccinated and achieved close to 80% overall.  Now there is evidence that antibody levels can wane, making the earliest vaccinated at risk of infection from particularly contagious variants such as delta.  The point is that a Fall booster will likely be required in order to maintain antibody levels long-term.  Again, [data from Israel is promising](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/24/israels-covid-19-vaccine-boosters-show-signs-of-taming-delta) that a booster helps, particularly in higher risk cohorts that are driving the bulk of vaccinated hospitalizations (over 60's).  It has also been shown that countries that stagger their doses beyond the manufacturer's recommended 3 weeks enables much higher and longer sustained antibody levels in the body.  It looks like you're from Canada based on your flair...Many parts of your country pushed doses to an 8-12 week schedule during a particular lull in the pandemic (spring/early summer) and it looks like hospitalizations and deaths have plummeted.  The vaccines work. \n\nFinally, you're clinging to this notion that vaccination should prevent infection altogether...First of all, it decreases the likelihood of infection to begin with.  Secondly, If there is a breakthrough case, it renders it basically into a bad cold, as do most other known coronaviruses.  COVID is not going to disappear entirely, it's going to be endemic.  This is why vaccination is so important...If the effects of the virus become the same as a seasonal flu/cold, our health care systems and infrastructure will not buckle or even blink under the existence of a long-term virus.  Without vaccination, COVID will continue to fill hospital beds and ICUs that would otherwise be used for other treatments/patients.  Elective surgeries would no longer need to be cancelled.  Quality of life for non-COVID patients could once again be addressed versus simply treating the mortally ill.\n\nIt's really easy to just dismiss the vaccines as ineffective when looking simply at case counts, etc.  The fact is that they are meant to mitigate the effects of the virus both by decreasing transmission rates, as well as drastically reducing the physical effects (long and short term) of breakthrough cases.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That is what I'm saying.

I know Pfizer just got one in the states but there's nothing but emergency use in Canada. I also know personally of 3 side effect cases involving the vaccine, 2 strokes and 1 heart arrhythmia.

One of these things is not like the other. \n\nLandlords can simply evict those who can’t pay and move in people who can. It’s not the same as a bank defaulting on a loan that owners can’t satisfy. With the housing crisis we are currently experiencing nationwide, I fail to see the implied threat of not being able to find people to satisfy those vacancies.\n\nAre you suggesting that once landlords have to evict those people, that they’ll suddenly no longer be able to find tenants for the properties?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I don't know if you are aware of this, but a lot of the houses that have been sold lately have been purchased by Wall Street investment firms. They have property management companies renting them out on their behalf. They just collect the proceeds as interest on their investment.  Since these are all leases that were started last year, they haven't really been subject to this problem. You wouldn't rent  to somebody in April of 2020 who just got furloughed. So by and large, these investors Don't benefit from the moratorium being lifted because their renters are paying. \n\n\nNow what happens if there are millions and millions of evictions. Well first of all, those millions and millions of renters now have shitty credit. So they're basically out of the rental market. They're pretty fucked.  That's a whole separate issue.\n\nBut that means there are suddenly millions and millions of new rental units hitting the market, driving rent prices down, and, consequently with rent being low, and housing being expensive, a lot of those end up on the housing market.  That drives housing prices down. So what's Wall Street going to do with all the houses they just bought?  Possibly, sell them.  Driving housing prices even lower. Who knows?\n\nNow in 2008, a big part of the problem was Banks had a shortage of people to buy houses. In order to fix that shortage, they had to lower their standards and lend to just any damn person off the street.  Not a problem, when the bank can just take the house and resell it to cover the debt. But sort of problematic, when prices drop and that option disappears. \n\nBut, some people in 2008 could have paid their mortgage, and opted not to. Because they were so underwater on their loans (i.e. owing $350k on a house worth 200k) that walking away meant they would come out ahead.  Turns out, that if you offer people $150,000 to tank their credit rating, some of them will take that.  So even without the other issue, that kind of stuff could still happen.\n\nHonestly, I have no idea what might happen. The point of the 2008 story is not that history will repeat, it's that The specific chain of events that would lead towards full economic collapse were not easy to predict.  The reason some people were able to predict that crisis anyways, is because they looked around and saw that there was a lot of dangerous warning signs around.\n\nThe situation right now feels pretty similar.

Those are *not* trivial problems, and they're not problems people have solved yet.

For example they have an immune system that protects them from diseases. If you grow them in a controlled environment, you wouldn't need that. Or plants like wheat and corn grow tall to get to the sunlight above other plants. Indoors, this wouldn't be necessary, What you would want ideally, for example in corn, would be just an ear of corn sticking out of the ground with two or three leaves to support it. There is no need to grow tall, because there is no competition. The plants could come to harvest quicker and you would need less space to do so. I think in the long run, the IP to make these vertically profitable strands would be much more valuable than the facilities they grow in. If you compare it with amazon, the genetics engineering companies are the ones providing the technical know how, the farmers just provide the warehouses.\n\n  \n2. **Data**: Vertical farms will be chock full of sensors. However, each farmer only has their own local datasets. I am sure the bio tech companies providing the genetic material will offer services to them to optimize their yield, or even contractually require the farmers to share all their data regardless of weather they will use these services or not. This way the biotechs will have all global data on their crops, thus being able to predict future yields and prices of crops on the world market. This way, even if there is a good year for farmers, they will be able to screw them out of their profits. Also, because they have all the data and can best optimize the yield, the farmer doesn't really have anything he can do to outperform his competitor. Farm a can be as good as farm b, if they both provide the optimal growth environment as recommended by the biotechs. This means that the most profitable vertical farms will win by reducing their cost. Again, compare it to amazon. If you want to run a profitable operation, you need to squeeze the wages of your employees and be in a location where energy is cheap and infrastructre is availabel. For the farmers, this isn't an attractive business, because they don't control these factors. They are set by minimum wage requirements and the infrastructure made available by governments.\n\n  \n3. **Overregulation**: Governments have in interest to remain somewhat independent in their food production. They don't want all the vertical farms to be in china or next to big dams where energy is cheap. They will step in with subsidies and regulations, to keep domestic food production at some minimum level. This creates market intransperency. Unfortunatley, this is the kind of intransperency that only benefits the big inverstors and corporations. They can sleeze their way into government programs and use this inside knowledge to make big gains. Those gains will be taken from retail investors, who will be the last ones to get the news about these kinds of deals.\n\n  \nAll these reasons have so far lead me to the conclusion to stay away from that market.
