Always err on the side of caution of go with the higher strikes first.\n\nTo estimate the limit order, subtract the price movement from your target strike price.

I started following this sub and some options YTubers in the last couple of months or so. I've already invested without options in stocks, ETFs, P2P lending, so I'm definitely not new to the game and I recently started trading some options, mainly doing some wheel strategy and some spreads. Nothing too complicated once you get the nomenclature right.\n\nSince I started investing years ago, there have been some ups and downs. I'm probably currently beating the market by a couple of percent points on average at the moment, but I'd say it's just a matter of luck rather than math honestly and I don't think my average is gonna hold for long.\n\nTBH I'm not even sure I am beating the market, because by actively investing I'm constantly holding onto some liquidity instead of simply dumping my savings in an S&P-based ETF (higher returns on lower capital vs lower returns on larger capital).\n\nWhat really bothers me, especially as a programmer by trade, is the thought that if there really was a way of calculating probabilities and objectively analysing indicators, the algos would simply always \"win\" (technically I guess they'd average their returns around 0% or even negative considering the commissions). The fact that algos don't really work, if not for some very limited time frames, is indicative of the randomness of the market, but people seem to not want to admit that markets are fundamentally random.\n\nSimply put, when people get good returns they say that their strategy worked 'cause they're geniuses, when they lose, they come up with some ex-post reasoning or make up a new indicator based on some weird formula that \"would have predicted that loss for sure, if only I knew!\"\n\n  \nWhat's your take?

You buy options with high Vega, low delta, low gamma, low theta when ITM. You sell as time approaches the earnings release. Interesting.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Whether I buy high delta, gamma, and Vega depends on the strategy. Always low theta.\n\n\nThis first strategy (Vega method), relies on a spike in IV before earnings. I want delta and gamma to be relatively low, because I want the actual performance of the stock to influence the price of the contract as little as possible. Keep in mind when I say relatively high/low delta/gamma, I say that because delta and gamma will always increase and decrease under the same circumstances, will always be similar when contracts are at the same percent in/out of the money, and will always be at .50 when the contract is exactly at the money. This means that there‚Äôs no way to just cheat the system by finding an out of the money contract with .80 delta, it won‚Äôt happen, so you just have to find the best delta to percentage-in/out of the money as possible, to maximize profits. I look for high Vega when I buy calls/puts before earnings and am relying on IV to raise prices. I typically buy near the money rather than in the money because it‚Äôs cheaper. Much of the time stocks will bump or dip slightly before earnings because people buy/sell in expectation of the price going up/down after earnings depending on a hit or miss. This allows the potential for my options to gain value without IV, but it isn‚Äôt necessary for this strategy. I then wait until a day or two before QR, (maybe 3 or 4 depending on if the QR release is on a Monday), then I sell. This strategy preys on the fact that people will buy options just before a QR, which is not a good idea, even if you predict the market you can get IV crushed. I make sure my expiration date is a few weeks after QR released so that I don‚Äôt get theta crushed. \n\n\nThe second strategy doesn‚Äôt rely on Vega to make money, so I want Vega to be low, that way if the IV goes down it doesn‚Äôt effect the value as much. Essentially as the stock price goes up, delta dictates how much contract value will go up. As the contract value goes up, delta will also go up; how much depends on the gamma. If I have high gamma, delta will go up even more than usual. Which means that as stock price goes up, contract price goes up exponentially. This always happens but using this method attempts to get maximum profit from a low buy in. This means ideally you want to find contracts with low delta, meaning low buy in price, but high gamma, because high gamma will lead to a more aggressive exponential growth as the option gets in the money. Then you just sell when you‚Äôve reached a comfortable profit. Strike depends on your risk level. I can explain how to determine a reasonable strike if you want, but I won‚Äôt do it here because it‚Äôs a whole nother thing with a bunch of math. Just lmk and I‚Äôll be happy to explain it. \n\n\nThe second method(delta/gamma) is more difficult than the first(Vega). This is because the first method doesn‚Äôt rely on chance as much. When QR‚Äôs come out, IV is pretty much certain to go up. So if I have high Vega, and IV goes up, the value of the contract will go up by a lot. You just have to time the buy and sell correctly, and make sure you don‚Äôt get theta crushed. The second method actually requires you to be right about the stock going up or down, so it‚Äôs much more difficult. Sadly, you can only use the first method(Vega method), once every three months because that‚Äôs when QR‚Äôs come out. You can use the second method (delta/gamma min maxing) any time. Let me know if anything I wrote doesn‚Äôt make sense. I wrote this on my phone late at night and was editing paragraphs during writing, so if something doesn‚Äôt track lmk and I‚Äôll rephrase. \n\nFantastic example I remembered I could include: msft. 52 week average IV for Msft is 22.7%. Current IV is 76%. Vega is 0.15. 76-23=53. 53x0.15=7.95. That means the value of one msft call contract would increase by 795 dollars on Vega alone, assuming the IV was at the average before earnings anticipation brought it up. Now of course it wasn‚Äôt average, it would be above average for the last few weeks at least. And other variables such as the actual performance of Microsoft would effect the value of the contract. But it just goes to show how hard Vega and IV can impact value \n\nI know this is pretty complicated, here are the definitions of the Greeks, with examples, if you‚Äôd like to read up on them: https://www.investopedia.com/trading/getting-to-know-the-greeks/#:~:text=Option%20Greeks%20are%20financial%20metrics,price%20of%20the%20underlying%20asset.\n\n\nTldr: high Vega low delta/gamma when wanting to use IV to make money off of QR‚Äôs. Low Vega, high delta/gamma when you want to just maximize profit off of options in general. I know it‚Äôs really long but it‚Äôs worth the read, it‚Äôs important to understand why this works.

Like you, I too am a programmer and a practitioner of pure math, so we probably think alike.  Diff conclusions tho.  First, yes, I am beating the market, by quite a bit.  Numerically, the market is actually not hard to beat as the market‚Äôs gains will never be astronomical.  They‚Äôll by definition always represent the mean.  So they‚Äôre very much within reach for a reasonable participant.\n\nSecond, there most definitely is a way of calculating probabilities; those methods are spelled out pretty meticulously in an entire branch of mathematics.  Probability density functions, likelihood functions, sample spaces & probability spaces accomplish this.  The issue is that what you arrive at is always a *model* of reality, not the actual underlying reality itself.  The model and the underlying reality of the market can diverge, and while the math in the model is naturally quantifiable & precise (the whole point of math), the building of the model is a thing that can‚Äôt be quantified in the same way because building it, and using it, is something that requires creativity, insights, skill‚Äî all nonlinearities & anomalous properties of an individual.\n\nAs for algorithmic nature of profit‚Äî yes, algos *most definitely* work.  They‚Äôre actually the best way to combat the perceived randomness of the market.  On the randomness of the market, look at it this way:  imagine a random, aka stochastic function, plotted on the x & y axes‚Äî a regular old 2-space.  Now imagine the same function, plotted in a 3-space with a z-axis.  If you rotate along the z-axis, the random function becomes skewed from your POV more and more severely, until eventually it looks like a 100% straight line from your perspective, extending predictably in the direction of the x-axis.\n\nSo I gave that little thought experiment to illustrate that ‚Äúrandomness‚Äù can definitely be unpacked well enough to make a lot of profit from, and thusly it follows that algorithms definitely can and are used to beat the market.\n\nMy advice is to create an algorithm for RISK MANAGEMENT.  This is one of the most effective ways to use your programming skill, and one of the best applications of algorithmic thinking.  Objectively and uniformly and mechanically limiting how much you can even possibly lose is the first step to making a ton of money.\n\nTLDR: I am beating the market.  It‚Äôs not a hobby, I live off of it.  You beat the market by finding a way to perform better than the mean, and there are a lot of ways to do it.  It relies on math, statistics, & programming, but above those things it relies on creativity & skill.  Randomness is very manageable, even predictable, and there are mathematical ways to do it.

{"title": "HIMS DD - A generational buy and this earning won't be too late because it isn't priced in", "selftext": "# Introduction\n\nHIMS is a stock that had gotten some steam recently with it's over 100% run this year, but has cooled down after trading in its $20-24 dollar range for a few weeks. I'm going to explain why a stock I have been following everyday for almost two years could MOON. With a great balance sheet, over 40% revenue growth projected, trendy weight loss products products, and profitably this is a no-brainer that I'm afraid everyone is going to miss by saying \"it's all ready priced in\", and I'm going to explain to you why it's not.\n\n# Numbers\n\nLets start by measuring HIMS growth by quarter.  In this graph, I've begin to notice a pattern. Through the last 8 quarters, HIMS has grown \\~100k subscribers a quarter.\n\n\n\nHowever, The last 2 q1s, HIMS has grown 170k subscribers.  I suspect this is because  Q1 is the time where people decide \"new year new me\" or \"new years resolutions\" and try things to fix the medical problems and start going to the gym. This data can be approximately tracked through the Google Trends, Sensory Tower (website/app traffic), and Instagram followers gained by HIMS AND HERS during that time. The HERS and HIMS Instagram accounts gain \\~2000 Instagram followers a month each, while seeing a bump in Jan -Feb because of the new year's resolutions.\n\nSource: [HIMS IG Followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hims) [HERS IG followers](https://socialblade.com/instagram/user/hers)\n\nI say all this to say this: **HIMS is seeing extreme growth across all platforms and numbers are suggesting a blowout quarter like they never seen before, while analyst and Wall Street is expecting another +\\~100k subs quarter.**\n\n|IG Followers|Q4 2023 (+111k subs)|Q1  2024 (+172k subs) +55%|Q2 2024 (+100% in Subs!) |\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|HIMS|5,017|6,227 (+24%)|14,808 (138%)|\n|HERS|5,817|8,468 (+45%)|14,847 (+75%)|\n|Total Subs/Followers|10.2 sub/followers|11.7 subs/followers|**302k-347k follower estimate!**|\n\nIn Q4 2023, they had a 10.2 new subscriber to followers ratio. In Q1 2024, they had an 11.7 new subscriber to follower ratio. **If this trend continues based on Q2 2024 IG followers, they would have a 302k-347k** **new subscribers**!\n\nI'm not the only one noticing this. The most bullish wall street [analyst with a $26 price target](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-raises-hims--hers-shares-target-on-growth-optimism-93CH-3482616) has notice this accelerated growth.\n\n\"The revision follows the analysis of various data sources, including Bloomberg Second Measure, Sensor Tower, and Similar Web, which indicated an acceleration in the company's online revenue growth for May.\n\nThe data showed that while monthly active user (MAU) growth slowed down in May, web visit growth, particularly on the Hers platform, picked up significantly. This surge in web traffic, especially towards the end of May, alongside a rise in observed sales, is believed to be partially driven by the successful launch of the company's GLP-1 product. BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue.\"\n\nUsing the website Sensory Tower the HERS app has gone from being ranked in the 60s on Q1 in the app store to ranked in the 20s in Q2. Similar Web and Google Trends also shows accelerated growth for anything HIMS and HERS related during Q2, clearly surpassing their \"best\" quarter Q1.\n\nSigns are pointing to this company doing 302k to 347k subs while analyst are expecting around 100-125k, which would already justify a moon, but what if I told you their is more? Because their is.\n\n|Earnings|Subscribers gained|Revenue gained (millions)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q4 2022|126,000|167|\n|Q1 2023|169,000|190 (+23mil)|\n|Q2 2023|91,000|208 (+18mil)|\n|Q3 2023|126,000|226 (+18mil)|\n|Q4 2023|111,000|246 (+20mil)|\n|Q1 2024|172,000|278 (**+32mil)**|\n\nWhat got lost in HIMS q1 earnings report was that despite doing that same \\~170,000 extra subscribers in q1, year over year, **they managed to gain 32 million in revenue instead of the usual \\~20 million.**\n\nWhy is this important? Because Q1 2024 was the first quarter where they sold their most expensive product, weight loss medication, and the pricing is much more expensive than pills and hair loss pills and analyst haven't noticed.\n\nYou see, HIMS advertises their monthly cost which is about \\~30-50 dollars a month for ED Pills, hair loss, skincare and mental health which is the bulk of their subscribers. However, They usually charge people to pay 3-6 months upfront to use these services. This amounts to an average order value of $90 in Q1 2023 and $109 in Q1 2024.\n\nIn other words, Every new subs usually pays $100-$175 upfront to HIMS.\n\n**However, with weight loss pills which are advertised as $80-100 a month, They charge customers $300 or $400 for a 3 or 5 month plan, much more expensive than the average of $109!**\n\n**With GLP-1 injections, they charge $400 for 1 month, $900 for 3 months, $1500 for 6 months or $2400 for a 12 months supply upfront!**\n\nThis is big because even the most bullish analyst thinks people subscribe and pay month to month. Let's read what the analyst said again:\n\n(\"BofA Securities noted that for every 5,000 GLP-1 customers, there is an estimated addition of approximately $1 million in monthly revenue.\") - **wrong Bozo**\n\nlets say the average GLP 1 customer pays $1000 for mostly 3 month plans with 6 and 12 months sprinkled in (low estimate it's probably more). 5,000 customers would be $5 million in revenue, not 1 million as if they are paying $200 a month every month).\n\nI say this all to say, **the reason they did 32 million in Q1 2024  instead of slightly more than the $23 million in q1 2023 is because they started selling weight loss pills at $400 a subscriber instead of everything else at \\~$109 a subscriber. And now, their average weight loss customer is paying either $400 for pills or \\~$900-2400 for shots, not the $80 or $199 advertised. This will bring explosive revenue growth to their average order value of $109 and every new subscriber is worth more than old subscribers.  And no analyst, even the most bullish, has notice this.**\n\nSo what does this all mean for the next earnings? The High estimate for HIMS is $312 million in revenue, which is +$36 million quarter over quarter. This is presumably the estimate of the analyst with the $26 dollar price target, who is only taking in to account the increased subscribers but not correctly factoring in increased pricing of products.\n\nAlso, The reason why the subscriber increased was because of the release and hype of weight loss products, so a majority of new subs are paying higher prices even if they did do their normal \\~100k subscribers. In other words, if 30% of new customers were weight loss customers last quarter, 60% are weight loss customers this quarter and weight loss customer are better than say skincare customers.\n\nSo here's my estimate for HIMS q2 2024:\n\nLow estimate: Lets assume 250k new subs and 150k are weight loss customers with the normal 100k regular customers.\n\n150k subs \\* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \\* $100 other products = $**70 million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**\n\nHigh estimate: Lets assume 300k new subs and 190k are weight loss pill customers, 10k are weight loss injection customers with an average order value of $1000, with the normal 100k regular customers.\n\n190k subs \\* $400 (weight loss pills)+ 100k subs \\* $100 other products + 10k \\*$1000 (GLP Cost) = $96 **million extra revenue quarter over quarter)**\n\n**This means the revenue estimate should be between $348 million and 374 million! This is +70%-84% revenue growth which blows out the expected +46%!** And the Instagram followers trends suggest 340k extra subscribers, I only did 300k in my high estimate to because these numbers are almost too good to believe, but when you go from selling $109 products to $2400 dollar products they make perfect sense.\n\nTLDR: What if Netflix 4x-10x their subscription price and wall street didn't notice or account for that in their estimates? That's what happened with HIMS. They will do Q2 2025 numbers in Q2 2024 because of upfront pricing. They will blowout earnings and I have a $40 dollar price target on the stock by giving it a 8 P/S which is justified and honestly a little low considering this growth and profitability.\n\nPart 2 coming after earnings with a deeper dive with my HIMS Erection.\n\nPositions:\n\n40 Nov 15 $33 calls\n\n20  jan 2026 $12 calls\n\n5 jan 2026 2026 $15 calls\n\n20 jan 2026 $25 calls\n\n*Not investment advice.
