Better batten the hatches because a debt hurricane is about to hit hard...\n\n**How much US corporate debt comes due over the next 3 years?**\r  \nAccording to S&P Global Ratings Research, $3.1 trillion of U.S. corporate debt will mature over the next three years. This is nearly double the combined profit of all S&P 500 Index members during their most recently completed fiscal years. This significant amount of debt maturing presents a challenge for companies, especially with rising interest rates.\r  \n**Impact of corporate debt repayment on S&P 500 earnings**\r  \nNaturally, the large amount of corporate debt repayment can indeed have an impact on the S&P 500 earnings. Here are some key points to consider:\r  \nInterest Rates: Borrowing costs for S&P 500 companies have risen to a two-decade high. Higher interest rates make debt refinancing more onerous, and new projects could also be reviewed, potentially lowering corporate investments in growth.\r  \nEarnings: Of the 69 basis points of contraction in Return on Equity (ROE) in the first half of the year, nearly half came from higher interest expenses. **Since the global financial crisis, falling interest costs and greater leverage have accounted for nearly one-fifth of an overall 8.8 percentage points increase in the ROE of S&P 500 firms**.\r  \nDebt Maturity: Some $820 billion of US and European non-financial corporate bonds are maturing in the next 12 months. While companies overall are not expected to run up against a truly devastating maturity wall before 2025 onwards, debt-ridden companies are already feeling the pain from higher rates.\r  \nProfitability: The risk of rates now being higher for longer could prevent firms from taking on more leverage, hitting long-term profitability.\r  \nHowever, it‚Äôs important to note that these impacts can vary widely depending on the specific debt circumstances of each company within the S&P 500.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "But what about war", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Think this is the top comment on pretty much every article in this sub", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Still laughing at that \"100% chance of recession in blow to Biden\" headline from Bloomberg in October 2022.", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "My fave, another recent one \"worst US bond bear market in history\".

First, BMW, MB, etc‚Ä¶ are putting out high quality EVs with great range. My BMW iX bests Tesla Model X in real world range all day. Tesla over estimates their range while every other EV manufacturer besides Rivian underestimates. Second, Elon Musk has alienated a big portion of his customer base via his comments about ‚Äúthe left‚Äù on Twitter.
