This significant amount of debt maturing presents a challenge for companies, especially with rising interest rates.\r  \n**Impact of corporate debt repayment on S&P 500 earnings**\r  \nNaturally, the large amount of corporate debt repayment can indeed have an impact on the S&P 500 earnings. Here are some key points to consider:\r  \nInterest Rates: Borrowing costs for S&P 500 companies have risen to a two-decade high. Higher interest rates make debt refinancing more onerous, and new projects could also be reviewed, potentially lowering corporate investments in growth.\r  \nEarnings: Of the 69 basis points of contraction in Return on Equity (ROE) in the first half of the year, nearly half came from higher interest expenses. **Since the global financial crisis, falling interest costs and greater leverage have accounted for nearly one-fifth of an overall 8.8 percentage points increase in the ROE of S&P 500 firms**.\r  \nDebt Maturity: Some $820 billion of US and European non-financial corporate bonds are maturing in the next 12 months. While companies overall are not expected to run up against a truly devastating maturity wall before 2025 onwards, debt-ridden companies are already feeling the pain from higher rates.\r  \nProfitability: The risk of rates now being higher for longer could prevent firms from taking on more leverage, hitting long-term profitability.\r  \nHowever, it’s important to note that these impacts can vary widely depending on the specific debt circumstances of each company within the S&P 500.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "But what about war", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Think this is the top comment on pretty much every article in this sub", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Still laughing at that \"100% chance of recession in blow to Biden\" headline from Bloomberg in October 2022.", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "My fave, another recent one \"worst US bond bear market in history\".

First, BMW, MB, etc… are putting out high quality EVs with great range. My BMW iX bests Tesla Model X in real world range all day. Tesla over estimates their range while every other EV manufacturer besides Rivian underestimates. Second, Elon Musk has alienated a big portion of his customer base via his comments about “the left” on Twitter. Third, and most important to the hyped valuation, Elon Musk has over promised to investors growth rates as well as product deliverables in order to hype the stock price. Roadster, cybertruck, full self driving, etc… he will continue to promise unrealistic goals to try and keep share prices up. Smart money has started to leave the stock and retail traders are left holding the bag. Tesla will not hit Elons growth targets over the next few years and I think you will see the valuation continue to come back down to earth.
