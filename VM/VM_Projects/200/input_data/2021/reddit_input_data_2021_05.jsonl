Its a contract where the buyer of the call is buying the right to purchase the stock at the strike price by the date of the contract.  So if a call is listed at .60 5/21 $12 you are paying $0.60/share (calls are contracts of 100 shares, so it would cost $60) for the right to buy the shares for $12 by 5/21.  On 5/22, if the price of the stock isn't at least $12.01, the contract expires worthless.  Also consider that you paid a premium of $0.60/share, so your breakeven wouldn't be until it's above $12.60/share.\n\nIf the stock went to $13/share, you'd be getting a discount of $0.40/share and could immediately sell the shares for $40 profit.  Most people that are interested in the quick money like that won't even buy the shares, they'll sell their contract as it would then be worth like $2.00/share if it goes well above the strike price before expiration.  Then you're looking at a profit of $140 for example.\n\nI think only like 8% of contracts are actually exercised.  23% expire worthless and 69% are sold/closed before expiration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you already own shares of CLOV (at least 100) you could write a contract that would obligate you to sell your shares if the contract went into the money.  The reason most people do this is because they don't think it will actually hit that price within that timeframe and they pocket the premium up front.  So the writer of our call from the above example gets $0.60/share up front = $60.  If the contract expires worthless, they keep the whole $60.  Most people will buy to close the contract as it gets close to $0, so maybe they buy to close for $10 and pocket $50.\n\nIf the contract does go into the money and they don't close out, they keep the profit on the shares, up to the contract price, plus the premium they received for the contract.  So again, using our above example, if the stock was at $10 when they wrote the $12 call, but it goes up to $13, they sell 100 shares at $12 each, plus the $0.60 in premium, so $2.60 profit per share ($260 total profit).  They miss out on that extra $0.40, but hey, profit is profit.\n\nEDIT: Also, if you're able to sell multiple contracts over a few weeks or months, you're indirectly bringing down your cost basis.  So if you pocketed like $0.60/share 4 times and you had bought in at $12.00, you're really at like $10.60/share without having bought more shares to average down.  Then you can sell for profit at like $11, even though you bought in at $12.\n\nCheck out /r/thetagang if this sounds appealing.  /u/RealLifeFF just tagging you cause I edited.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "CLOV had been getting absolutely wrecked.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "After I jumped in with no toilet paper and a wet shit. \nIt tanked.\nOh well riding this out win or loose.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Bought in yesterday.

Full disclosure i have 100 shares and 2 short puts on AMD expiring 5/7 @$85. here we go.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Why buy?**\n\n$AMD released their earnings last week with some pretty stellar results both on YoY and vs consensus estimate. They increased their full year guidance from a 37% YoY growth to 50%, and what does the market do? It dumps the crap out of the stock down almost $12 from earnings intraday high of $89. \n\nThey say stonk prices are valued by future potential and not past performance, and it seems the market doesn't like good earnings or upgrades to forecasts. This I don't understand and this market movement downwards presents an opportunity to buy in when the stock is undervalued. \n\nAs a gamer, i recognise how AMD has transformed over the years, and simply as a chip maker its clearly the market leader in CPU's now, and with an all encompassing monopoly over the current of consoles. There's simply no downside to their current trajectory.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chip shortage.**\n\nThe elephant in the room is obviously the global chip shortage. I believe this is the core reason for all the FUD. If we dig a bit deeper the chip shortage is really because of Covid, more people at home to work, play and learn means more demand for tech, which is a great thing in the mid to long run. \n\nBut I believe that the market is being short sighted at the moment, focussing in, and penalising AMD because of their percieved risk around being able to pump out enough stock to meet demand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final thought**\n\nEnd of the day, i think if your investment horizon is more than 12months, there is a pretty strong bull case for AMD. Looking at the 1 year chart, there is a pretty strong support around $73-75.\n\nAs always do your own research , but hopefully you'll see what a massive potential AMD is.  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cznh9hm6j3x61.png?width=1384&format=png&auto=webp&s=f982f936b4337cca2f1b63452b526fc0045cda1b", "id": "n4ncpw", "created_utc": 1620131959.0, "score": 415, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 192, "comments": [{"body": "1 year? excuse me this is a casino", "score": 127, "replies": [{"body": "Farm those free drinks at the penny slots", "score": 12, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 150, "replies": [{"body": "Or maybe Nvidia is just overvalued.", "score": 85, "replies": [{"body": "not rly they are shitting gold lmao", "score": 106, "replies": [{"body": "Sold out shit the moment it drops", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "The same could be said for AMD though.", "score": 20, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nvidia isn't worth a ton of money because of their consumer desktop graphics cards dude.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Same could be said for AMD, they are starting to rip Intel a new one in the HPDC and Server segments.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "Nvidia Revenue 2020 was $16b.

On top of all of this the have opened some of their gpu tools to the public by making them open source which will see huge support from the developer community which could make them leaders of industry standards in gpus.

The employer decides where to spend the money in order to attract labour. This is business; there isn't anything moral or amoral about it like you imply by calling it an \"excuse\".\n\nIt seems also you don't understand what is included in total comp vs wages.

Not only that, but [increasing the payout from social programs also reduces the LFPR](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/229716069.pdf); you get less taxpayers while simultaneously needing more funding for social program obligations to be maintained at given levels.\n\nNow we also have [these guys](https://www.investors.com/politics/editorials/myth-busted-taxpayers-are-not-subsidizing-wal-marts-low-wages/) who take issue with a report written by Democrats that claims [Walmart can pay its workers so little because of welfare and social benefits programs.](https://americansfortaxfairness.org/files/Walmart-on-Tax-Day-Americans-for-Tax-Fairness-11.pdf)They are half correct: that is why walmart can pay so little, but when they claim\n\n>\"Sheppard goes on to write that \"According to a 2014 report by Americans for Tax Fairness, Wal-Mart receives an estimated $6.2 billion in subsidies every year, primarily from the Federal Government.\" **If Wal-Mart would only pay its workers more, the argument goes, taxpayers would save all this money.**\n\nThey suddenly [start reasoning from a price change](https://www.themoneyillusion.com/never-reason-from-a-price-change/): they ignore the first step which is that welfare subsidises labour which causes more labour to be offered at lower prices thereby reducing equilibrium wage.

Is our goal to increase nominal wages or to increase living standards? If a 2021 car costs half as much and lasts twice as long as a car from 1980, do we really care that wages \"stagnated\"? You can buy twice as much at any given income, is that any different than doubling your income?\n\nThis is also why we care about total comp. Before like 1980 you had to get your wages and then buy your health insurance after tax. After that you could get your healthcare paid for pre-tax. Pre-tax makes it a benefit AND removes the extra 30% income tax you had to pay before you could go buy your healthcare! Would you rather have 10% more wages that you pay 30% tax on or 10% more benefits that you pay 0% tax on? Do you want those stock options into your 401k with no tax or do you want a wage increase that the government is going to take 30% of?\n\nMinimum wage is a price floor, it doesn't \"bring wages in line\" with anything. At worst it causes industries and jobs to disappear and at best it has no effect. Ex. Raising min wage from $7.25 to $10/hour in Texas would have no effect because there are 0 jobs offered at $10/hour as equilibrium min wage is above that level.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Admittedly I had a hard time on the same website finding the data I wanted before making my previous comment.\n\nthe [BLS.gov](https://BLS.gov) website is absolute trash and a royal pain to find anything on especially lately.

{"title": "Discovering the True Rate of Inflation: A DD on the Fed", "selftext": "*Would have posted on* r/investing*,  but they don't allow graphs. Read at your own risk.*\n\nSo I've been reading a lot of fear-mongering and fear-downplaying as of late about the CPI, and what it actually means. **There are two narratives I see about inflation around WSB:**\n\n1. The inflation we're experiencing is transitory and should dissipate after pent-up demand is satisfied.\n2. Inflation is higher than we think it is, and will cause widespread economic damage when it runs out of control. \n\nI decided to do some research into the questions: \"how much inflation are we really experiencing?\" and \"is it out of line with historical inflation\" to try to provide some insight into the two theses above. And also I was trying to learn SQL and this was helpful with that.\n\nSince this is WSB, I'm going to jump right into the results and talk about methodology further down. However, its worth noting that 1) I am not using the same basket the government uses, and 2) I decided to mostly use data from the OECD, not the US government to run these numbers. This is not economist-grade research. Use carefully.\n\nSo...\n\n# What is the actual Inflation Rate? \n\nBased on my projections for the last 10 years, the rate of inflation may be 4.2% annually, which is significantly higher than the 1.5-2.25% the government tells us. This chart shows the total increase per quarter, with a final result of 42.7% at the beginning of Q1 2021 (100 is the base for this chart).\n\n[10 years of price increases across my basket of prices.](https://preview.redd.it/28zzeeeuryz61.png?width=1678&format=png&auto=webp&s=1820b1cdf15123308480a46afb0ebec59ab254f7)\n\n**What does this overall picture say about our two theses?**\n\nTo question 1: According to this basket of prices I analyzed, I do not believe inflation will be transitory without major government action. Inflation appeared to be picking up in the 2018-2019 period, and that is in addition to what was an already high level of inflation throughout the decade. The additional liquidity provided during the pandemic is unlikely to sink in without higher interest rates.\n\nTo question 2: I don't know what these results say about the inflation explosion thesis. You tell me. However, 2 thoughts: it doesn't seem like this new round of inflation is all that far out of line with the last 10 years. But that line is scary.\n\n**What about inflation in Housing?**\n\nGood question! That was part of the analysis, and to nobody's surprise, the price of owning a house has gone up more than almost every other measure.  \n\n[A graph of inflation in housing prices,  2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/cxwqsb3buyz61.png?width=1078&format=png&auto=webp&s=69350519159a460ab16034724b05fab9111f9e9d)\n\nThat's right, it appears that it is 52% more expensive to buy a house than it was in 2011, and there was a sharp upturn during the pandemic. The same cannot be said for renters, who only experienced 37% inflation in the same period. Right now at least, it seems relatively more attractive to rent than own. What really surprised me is that rent prices continued along relatively smoothly during the pandemic.\n\n[A graph of rent prices from 2011-2021](https://preview.redd.it/u1p8k5w2vyz61.png?width=1040&format=png&auto=webp&s=9313b90056ba27d95c63cbff50b7e0142d84b327)\n\nI also looked at other things to make this analysis, but if you're an ape and therefore incapable of reading methodology, you can stop here. \n\n# How did you come up with these numbers?\n\nI decided to create a new CPI (consumer price index) based on what people actually purchase today, rather than the selective basket the BLS uses to calculate the real CPI. However, to do this I had to use BLS data from [here](https://engaging-data.com/household-spending-income/).\n\n[This is what the average household's spending habits look like.](https://preview.redd.it/r8uyuddawyz61.png?width=2328&format=png&auto=webp&s=65f84fa18e10eac9405208f602e2d4d03479fcfd)\n\nTo construct my basket, I took inflation data by category from the OECD and weighted it by its allocation in the average household budget. I've got everything from education to healthcare, clothes,  food, cars, and entertainment, alongside the big ones discussed above.\n\n I also broke housing out into rent costs vs ownership costs based on the percent of people who are homeowners. Then, and this is perhaps the most potentially controversial, I used the stock market as a measure of inflation for people's savings. This means that I pegged the rate of inflation allocated to savings to the price of $VTI. I justify this by thinking that the cost of investing has grown by more than 250%, which is what most people want to do with their savings. Criticize this (rightly) if you like. Lastly, I did use the entertainment *producer price index*to to estimate inflation there, as I couldn't get good numbers for an entertainment CPI, but the PPI is generally correlated to the CPI, and it's a small part of the chart. \n\n**Last thing I'll note:**\n\nIf you buy my argument about the inflation rate, then you'll be unhappy to compare it to wage growth. You'll see that wages have historically grown by 2%. yearly, which means that the average worker's wages have *decreased* about 2% yearly. That somewhat changed during the pandemic, when wages *exploded.* However, I thought about it for 10 seconds and realized this may be because all the low-wage workers got fired, temporarily pushing the numbers up. IDK. Rich people always win. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8vzzrknsyyz61.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a1ba2ddc10e53d0553e597ae6d990751a23cc14\n\nAlright, I'm done now.

Broadly speaking, a generational new deal would contain three elements.\n> \n> 1- Limited bailouts: politicians and voters would realize the futility of trying to restore the world of yesterday.\nWhether it is fair or not, the post-Covid 19 world will need fewer cruise ships and cars, as fewer workers commute to their offices. Airlines CEOs, who failed to prepare for what should have been a normal business risk after the SARS, avian flu, and Ebola outbreaks, do not deserve to get bailed out. Neither do investors who bought junk bonds in highly leveraged companies, or the private equity managers who sold them. The U.S. bankruptcy system is designed to reorganize failed businesses and transfer their assets into stronger hands. Creative destruction is the true engine of long-term growth: it should be encouraged, or at least allowed.\n>\n> 2- Large fiscal response: record low interest rates, mass unemployment, and depressed commodity prices create a\ngenerational opportunity to “build stuff” – in the words of entrepreneur Marc Andreesen. Hospitals, dams, 5-G towers, windmills, solar panels … the bigger the better. Austrian types will correctly point out that some of this production will be wasted on bridges to nowhere, pork barrel politics, and the kind of highly visible but\nuneconomical projects that bureaucrats crave, such as high-speed bullet trains. Encouraging the private sector to build simple things, such as affordable houses near major urban centers, could reduce the risk of wasteful spending. But ultimately, even wasteful government spending would achieve the goal of injecting money into the\neconomy, provide employment, and eventually kickstart inflation.\n>\n> 3- Inflationary policies: **inflation is the only politically palatable solution to the generational crisis.** A decade of\nhigh single-digit inflation would wipe out about two third of the outstanding value of all student debt ($1.6 trillion), encouraging household formation, boosting discretionary spending, and eventually reversing the decline in births. A flexible universal basic income would allow the government to target a desired price level much more effectively than the failed monetary policies of the past decade. Protectionist measures would transfer purchasing power from idle consumers (the old) to the working producers (the young).\n>\n> The generational inflation gap I mentioned in the earlier part would eventually shrink. Housing prices would\nfall because of the recession at first, and then thanks to an increase in the supply of affordable homes in tense housing markets. Medicare for all, for which the moral case has never been stronger, would spread the rising cost of healthcare across generations. Medicare for all would also reduce the cost of labor, increase\ncompetitiveness, and boost economic flexibility as workers would be able to switch jobs more easily. Last, if the world economy can work on Zoom meetings, so can classes of 30 college students. Colleges have shown true genius to preserve their rents, escape competition, and ignore the technological revolutions of the past 30 years, but Covid-19 may eventually be lethal to university mandarins.

If wages go up then everything becomes more expensive. This is taking everything else equal of course. Wages CAN go up without causing inflation if it is paired with increased productivity. \n\nThink of it like this: how much does it cost to make something? Well you need raw resources, energy, and then manpower or technology. If manpower costs go up they aren't ever going down which means inflation. Of energy prices go up, well they can go back down in a month...its temporary. Raw materials are the same...during supply shocks like we ha e right now prices go up.

Moreover, if you look at a chart of productivity vs wage growth in the last 50 years, you’ll notice that estimated productivity continues to rise radically, while wages begin to flatline in the ‘70s. If what you’re saying is true, then we could expect to have extreme deflation over that period- fewer wage dollars are now chasing relatively more goods. But capital and rentier income has grown massively at the same time, offsetting that effect. \n\nThe main place I’d argue you can see that effect in action is the difference between inflation in essential consumer goods, and in luxury goods and assets.

Every once in a while I revisit this on my head, and I always come to the same conclusion - this doesn't make sense and why do people say this all the time?\n\nMy points:\n\n1. income is income, no matter where it comes, and it can be used to spend wherever you want to spend. What's the reason to say that a specific income gets applied as a discount to a particular purchase? It makes the same (no) sense as if I found a dollar on the street and say that now my morning coffee is 1$ cheaper. Or conversely, why can't I say that I sell a covered call on my $AAPL shares and with that money I reduced my cost basis on my $MSFT purchase?\n2. more importantly, it doesn't make sense from a tax point of view. Tax-wise the money earned on CCs does not really reduce the basis when I report to the IRS. Moreover, if I hold long term, taxes on the CC income and on the stocks gains will likely be short-term for the CCs and long term for the stock. The only way options \\*really\\* affect the cost basis of the stock is if I get assigned on a CSP (or if I exercise a call, but in that case it \\*increases\\* the cost basis). So it doesn't make any sense from an accounting point of view either\n\nIs all then just self-delusion? Happy to hear arguments!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT - Thanks for all the comments!
