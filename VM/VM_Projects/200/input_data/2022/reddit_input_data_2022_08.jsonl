Another user (TheDude0007) alleged to have capitalized on the BBBY spike, turning $45,000 into almost $450,000 using common stock and call options.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond has been a part of the meme stock craze that has hit Wall Street in recent years and driven names like GameStop and AMC Entertainment higher as investors bought up shares and forced short sellers to attempt to cover their losses, creating what’s known as a “short squeeze.” According to data from FactSet, a whopping 46% of the stock’s float is sold short.\n\nAs many retailers cope with inflation-wary consumers and excess inventory, Bed Bath & Beyond has struggled to reverse declining sales, fix its merchandising strategy and gain back customers who have fled to its competitors — all while searching for a new leader after the board announced in late June that its CEO Mark Tritton had left the company.\n\nAt the same time, the Union, N.J.-based home goods retailer has also been burning through cash as its net losses grow. While the company has not provided a forecast, it said it expects same-store sales trends to improve after plummeting 24% year-over-year in the quarter ended May 28.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/08/bed-bath-beyond-shares-jump-30percent-as-message-board-mentions-soar.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/08/bed-bath-beyond-shares-jump-30percent-as-message-board-mentions-soar.html)\n\nBed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the NASDAQ, is currently up 37%.

(GME, AMC, KOSS, BB.)\n\nBecause it's mostly the same retail traders buying/selling/discussing these stocks.

So when one moves, herding behavior of retail traders tends to make the others move too. \n\n\n\n>> How is it that BBBY becomes 107% short and GME becomes 140% short?\n\nBecause they are both losing money each quarter with no concrete business plan to become profitable again.

Also GME is like 20% short right now so i'm not sure where you got 140% from.\n\nAlso doesn't the 107% SI on BBBY kind of tell you whats going on?

Is that not kind of obvious now that you mentioned it?\n\n\n\n>> How is the \"majority\" of price movement from retail when institutions are 107% short and Ryan Cohen owns 9%?\n\nIs that an important person? No single short position is that large by the way. A short interest above 100% doesn't actually mean anything - a share can be short sold by multiple subsequent trades. \n\n'Retail' can move the price because there are hundreds of thousands of them making small trades individually that add up to a whole lot - doesn't WSB have like 12 million people on it?\n\n\n\n>> At this point literally any amount of critical thinking leads to the conclusion that some serious money fucked up. \n\nI mean betting against BBBY seems pretty reasonable given how overvalued the stock is - they are not doing well as a business right now. \n\n\n\n>> now it's time to see who's holding the bag.\n\n\nProbably the people buying a very expensive stock that's going to be out of business by the end of the year (unless they can raise some capital through another stock offering).\n\nEveryone thinks they are smarter than everyone else and that they'll be able to find someone to buy it at a higher price than they did.\n\n\n>> Here is your \"narrative\", what is more likely?

A call means you call bullshit on a stock and think it will crash. Use this if you think a stock is overvalued or will crash soon. 8/12 is the expiration date meaning this is how long you have to hold and make money. The closer it gets to the date the more money you can make.\n\nSPY 420 P 8/12. This is a put. Think about it as putting your money where your mouth is. If you are putting faith in a company going up you buy puts to the price you think they're going up to. The easiest way to remember this is P= Profits. Buy them when stocks are going to go up. The same expiration date information applies to puts.\n\nDD = Don't Do it. This where users argue against what they believe is going to happen to strengthen their arguments. Anything you read in a dd should be taken as false it is strictly a thought experiment.\n\nIV = Instant Value. The higher the IV the more likely your position is to make money. The higher the IV the cheaper options are. This is when you want to buy them.\n\nFD = Free Dollars.

It is the most secure crypto exchange and has a 56 million user base with 11% market share. 90% of their revenue comes from fees that they have held steady. Coinbase is one of the top 5 most profitable exchanges, of any type, in the world. Coinbase might make more money than Nasdaq. Why I like COIN is that it is a play on Bitcoin *AND* all the other coins out there...whereas bitcoin is just a play on bitcoin, so you are getting all the other coins for free. For now, COIN is heavily (96%) tied to the price of bitcoin, which is very hard to predict but they are rapidly diversifying their revenue streams (NFT marketplace; custody agent for Facebook's crypto wallet and SoFi's crypto offering and others; starting a media arm; crypto derivatives; Coinbase AWS type of cloud services offering; etc). Once you have defi and staking opportunities really start come online at critical mass at COIN these create a yield generation opportunity. Another advantage of COIN is it is the first crypto exchange on a major market exhange, meaning COIN potentially can use their stock as currency to buy any other competitors. And you don't have to believe in the crypto party line and the dangers of fiat currency and how you need an alternative, because central banks all over the world are printing money like crazy - even if you think this is nonsense, we know that there is a market for this kind of nonsense because gold bugs have been saying the same thing for decades. In other words, crypto has a natural constituency. Like gold, people buy it as a kind of inflation insurance and gold's strength is its scarcity - its supply only increases about 1% per year and it is getting harder and harder to find more - that sounds a lot like Bitcoin to me and I think it is totally legitimate to believe that crypto, in general, can rival gold as a storehold of value. \n\nAs far as the criticism of Coinbase’s business model being eroded by other competitor entrants, COIN isn’t the same as a traditional stock exchange or broker, whose services are easier to duplicate. Coinbase has more comprehensive services, from custody to exchange to brokerage, and its fees take this larger suite of services into account. Handling cryptocurrencies is much trickier than holding stocks, given that crypto has a history of being hacked or lost. The company is also building out a “suite of services” that have recurring revenue, including a program called “staking” that allows crypto holders to earn interest. Also, the structure of COIN is really different when compared to traditional stock exchanges in that you have to think about COIN as being an amalgamation of a brokerage like Schwab + a custodian like BNY Mellon + an exchange like NASDAQ + an OTC desk + investment bank like Goldman Sachs and having a Citadel Capital all baked into one company. This collection of business types in COIN has a real moat and hence you have to look at COIN very differently and not compare it apples to apples with any type of traditional stock brokerage or even other crypto brokerages. COIN's ability to bundle these different services creates a moat that defends its margins and gives it pricing power.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I think the last 12 months has shown us that btc is not an insurance from inflation nor a store hold of value", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Neither is most of the NASDAQ.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Lol no one said it was.. what’s the Nasdaq got to to with anything", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "So what happens to Blackrocks offer and stock price?", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "creepto is a scam.

You believe the state can and should monopolize what's considered law (Because I know your argument better than you, I know that you probably believe law is a public good that only the government can provide, therefore the monopoly on legal aggression and final say in disputes in a given territory aka the state ought to exist as it is currently understood)\n2. Given 1, you believe the state should set arbitrary percentages of money that they can take from you based on your income given they call this \"the law\"\n3. Given 2, you believe the state should be able to take that money from your paycheck without your consent or that they can send a tax bill to you and compel you to pay it because this action is taken in accordance with their declaration of \"law\"\n4. Given 1, 2, & 3, you don't believe in consent is the foundation of society, rather you believe tax funded political authority and taxation is the foundation of society\n5. Given 1,2, 3, & 4, you believe people that call themselves the law have the right to compel you to pay the tax bill they send you\n6. Given 5, you believe that if people do not comply with what the government calls the law, then government agents should have the ability to steal your assets and/or force you into court in order to hear charges the government should prosecute you with\n7. Given 6, If you do not comply with the state's orders, then you believe the government should have the right to force you into compliance and in doing so capture and cage you and even murder you if you should defend yourself against their aggression\n8. Given 1-7, once the state has your money, you believe politicians should spend it on whatever political ends you prefer\n9. Given 8, you believe the ends justify the means\n10. Given 9, Regardless of the ends resulting in what you believe they were going to result in, the important thing for you ( and other ideological people like you) is that the state have the power to tax. In your ideological worldview taxation equals \"good\" regardless of the results -- probably because you believe in the nonsense notion of the greater good or something along the lines of that hokum\n\nYou may be too obtuse to realize it, but 1-10 are the implications of your ideological beliefs. That's why you're an ideologue and why I describe you accurately as such\n\nI hold none of these beliefs and prefer peace and prosperity ie people being able to direct their lives as they see fit without intervention by the state under the color of law that results in terrible unintended consequences and very high opportunity cost.

My company helps pay for my graduate school tuition, employee stock options, medical insurance, among other things and they get a tax benefit for that.

Heaton testified in bankruptcy court Tuesday.\n\n“It is more and more likely within the next several years we’ll see a 3M bankruptcy, yes,” Heaton told US Bankruptcy Judge Jeffrey J. Graham during a hearing in federal court in Indianapolis.\n\n“We strongly disagree with this unsupported and clearly flawed speculation,” company communications manager Sean Lynch said in an emailed statement. “3M has committed to provide $1 billion to a trust for claimants determined to be entitled to compensation.”\n\nSome advocates for the suing soldiers want Graham to block 3M from paying any shareholder dividends, buying back any of its stock or spinning off any assets, if the judge also decides to halt the lawsuits.\n\nRestricting how 3M spends its cash will protect money and other assets that could be used to compensate soldiers who have had their hearing damaged by the earplugs, the advocates said in court papers.\n\nThe company has a paid shareholders a regular dividend for at least a decade. Currently the quarterly payment is $1.49 per share.\n\nCompany lawyers disputed Heaton’s findings during the hearing, arguing that the 19 cases in which juries returned verdicts are outliers and cannot be used to extrapolate results for the other cases. Heaton, a former trial lawyer who now studies corporate litigation, acknowledged that the sample is small and that a judge may conclude $100 billion is not realistic.\n\n3M is in federal court trying to convince Graham to halt the lawsuits while the company’s earplugs subsidiary reorganizes in bankruptcy.\n\nLast month, the company put its Aearo Technologies unit into bankruptcy in Indianapolis as a way to resolve the claims. Under Chapter 11 rules, Aearo is automatically entitled to freeze lawsuits it faces, but because 3M itself didn’t file bankruptcy a judge must agree to give the industrial conglomerate the same protection.\n\nThe bankruptcy is Aearo Technologies LLC, 22-02890, United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Indiana (Indianapolis).\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/3m-faces-100-billion-losses-162828827.html", "id": "wqc37h", "created_utc": 1660700738.0, "score": 770, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 192, "comments": [{"body": "Judges and politicians are *way* cheaper than 100 billion.", "score": 585, "replies": [{"body": "Alex Jones will most likely see part of his 45 mill settlement cut to 750k because the Texas Supreme Court put a cap on punitive damages.

Nuclear power plants take roughly 5 years to build.
