Also to make it even juicier the Yen was going down in value so imagine this‚Ä¶\n\nYou take out a $100,000 loan (of Yen) that you have to pay back w/ 1.5%, you go invest in tech stocks/treasuries. Let‚Äôs say you make 5%, that‚Äôs $5,000 profit, bringing you to a total of $105,000. You only have to pay back $101,000 in Yen, but also the Yen has gone down 20% in value, meaning you only have to pay back $80,000 (in Yen). And people keep on adding for YEARS to these loans because it‚Äôs getting cheaper and cheaper and free profits. \n\nNot to mention they are also using SOOO MUCH margin. So imagine this, they secure the 100k loan and get a 200k position, 100k margin in Nvidia.\n\nBut wait‚Ä¶ Japan decides to raise rates which increases the value of the Yen while everyone else is cutting rates (or about to) which decreases the value of *said currency*\n\nSo Yen üìà everyone else üìâ, this makes paying off loans even more difficult and this doesn‚Äôt include the margin call. \n\nSo now you have a 200k margin position on Nvidia, Nvidia is down 20%, so you‚Äôre down $40,000, on your position and get margin called. (More selling pressure) \n\nNow you have to pay back an extra $40,000. Meaning your $100k of equity is now $60,000, and now bank of Japan is margin calling you because you only have 60k of the 100k owed, but also the Yen is up 10%, so you really owe 110,000 of Yen.\n\nThis is a super small example‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not 100,000, people think it‚Äôs 10trillion‚Ä¶", "score": 241, "replies": [{"body": "What a great example", "score": 17, "replies": []}, {"body": "Great explanation !", "score": 11, "replies": []}, {"body": "^^^THIS.

{"title": "Crash Incoming.", "selftext": "I would love to share my findings on the indication of a probable yet most likely not as soon as expected, crash. I have looked at historical data, interests rates globally, and the VIX.\n\nThroughout history, mostly in the U.S a high peak in interests rates, ultimately conspire to a massive drop which is followed by a recession. You can see that in the charts. Please note that those crashes were not mainly caused by the spike of the rates, but it was also coupled by a somewhat of a black swan event. E.x 2019 spike in interest rates followed up by Covid. Or 2007 peak of interest followed by the housing crash after a cut in 2008-2009.\n\nThat alone isn't going to justify a crash. Japan has raised rates which if you follow the Japanese market that DOES NOT happen often. Most memorable moments where Japan raises interest and the U.S cuts is back in 2008 (housing crash). In addition, England has also cut rates which has not happened since Covid 2020...\n\n2024's Black Swan could very much be the A.I \"bubble\" or a potential War, which I'll get to later on.\n\n10% of the U.S stock market engages in a technique called the \"carry trade\". Which is a form of arbitrage where you take a loan out of a country that offers extremely low rates, in this case it was Japan's yen BEFORE the raise. Then you take an equivalent to lets say $1000 of yen and put it in either a safe yield/bond or the stock market. People started doing that much more with speculations of a rate cut happening in September (U.S FEDS).... which did not happen.\n\nInstead, Japan raised it's rates and the stock market crashed due to poor labor U.S data, taking us away from a confident cut, to a not so confident one anymore. Please keep in mind the $1000 that was taken from Japan most likely was not just invested as the prime amount, but more of on average $2000 due to leverage trading. A standard 1:2 is common and therefore people who have lost the initial $1000 (50% loss) most likely are now in debt to the raising interest to Bank of Japan. Hence the outstanding bear charts of the top 2 banks in Japan. Accumulating to a total today of a 20% loss in the stock market.\n\nThis would lead to tons of people to declare bankruptcy and sell off massively causing a crash (which it did on Friday)\n\nAnd no Japan can't just start printing money because their GDP to Debt ratio is at 260%, 9 Trillion Dollars...\n\nEconomics aside, the pressure and uncertainty of a potential war with I.S and Iran is on the table increasing uncertainty.\n\nWith all this in hand, it is hard when to predict a global crash, even though almost $3 trillion dollars were wiped out...\n\n[U.S Interest to Recession Charts](https://preview.redd.it/etw16xsfotgd1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d4f18313b0117adb97aa0273524180a317a9da3)\n\nThere's more images I want to add but can't...", "id": "1ekkelk", "created_utc": 1722853702.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments** | 7 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 weeks | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Good work, Sherlock.

BofA started offering rates about 1.5-2% lower than they had been a month prior, starting around the end of June. Chase caught on and started doing the same within a week of BofA, and then the smaller or more specialized lenders started to follow suit. These rates are being offered to super prime borrowers on well collateralized loans, basically risk free paper. This tells me that they all expect rates to drop significantly within the first 1/2 of the 5-6 year loan terms. It‚Äôs essentially a bond trade, and they‚Äôre trying to fatten up their portfolios and get a jump on the other banks. This isn‚Äôt too significant or unexpected, all the banks expect rates to drop. Side note- expect the rate being offered by dealers to consumers to lag what‚Äôs being offered at wholesale to the dealers by the lender.

Copenhagen-type interpretations hold that quantum descriptions are objective, in that they are independent of physicists' personal beliefs and other arbitrary mental factors.[5]:‚Ää85‚Äì90‚Ää\n\nOver the years, there have been many objections to aspects of Copenhagen-type interpretations, including the discontinuous and stochastic nature of the \"observation\" or \"measurement\" process, the difficulty of defining what might count as a measuring device, and the seeming reliance upon classical physics in describing such devices.

{"title": "Market Rally Has Only Just Begun", "selftext": "This post was [originally published](https://sam-weiss.com/market-rally-has-only-just-begun/) at [www.sam-weiss.com](http://www.sam-weiss.com](http://www.sam-weiss.com))\n\nYesterday morning, I published a reddit post entitled ‚ÄúSharp, Short-Lived Sell-off Coming‚Äù where I conclude that we‚Äôre likely to see a good sized 3-4% pull-back on the NASDAQ-100 and a $10-$15 pull-back in NVDA. The reasons for that are pretty straight-forward.¬†\n\nFirst, the indices (QQQ/SPY/Dow) are all very overbought in the nearly vertical rally we‚Äôve seen since August 5. They‚Äôve all hit extremely overbought territory in the hourly RSI. In most cases, that tend‚Äôs to precede a near-term sharp sell-off. Not always, but in the overwhelming majority of the cases. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôll see. NVDA is also deeply overbought. The most we‚Äôve seen in 6-months in fact. You can read more about that in¬†yesterday's post.\n\nSecond, there‚Äôs an identifiable trend in the NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) that is very well established. The QQQ doesn‚Äôt tend to trade sideways or linger after a correction. It almost always immediately rebounds and that rebound is generally very robust. In most cases, we see a good 10-15% rebound from the lows in the first 25-days after bottoming, a sharp pull-back and then another leg higher. So that trend is also in play. In just 12-13 trading days, the QQQ is already up 14.62%. That‚Äôs an insane rally off the lows without even a small pull-back.¬†\n\nAnyway, those are the¬†main reasons why I expect we‚Äôll see a sharp pull-back fairly soon. We‚Äôre talking before next week and definitely before NVDA earnings. In fact, I suspect NVDA will both pull-back and then go right back to its highs before it goes into its actual earnings date. We‚Äôll likely be higher as we head into earnings.¬†\n\n# Why Near-Term Forecast Are Important\n\nNow here‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt think came through in my post and what I‚Äôd like to mention today. First off, you‚Äôll never ever hear me advocate trading any near-term move. Never hear me advocating shorting which I think is almost always a losing proposition. Just not worth it to ever short anything ever. The overall risk-reward imbalance is almost always to the upside. The market is up 66% of the time. So not smart to ever short anything. Especially not NVDA as that would be insane. We‚Äôll get into why later on. Suffice it to say, that wasn‚Äôt the point of the forecast I published yesterday.¬†\n\nThe point is to feel secure in one‚Äôs position when a sell-off does happen. For example, if we know the markets generally pull-back sharply after being overbought or after a 10-15% move off the lows and then that pull-back actually occurs as forecasted, we don‚Äôt need to sit around and speculate (or be unsure) as to the reasons. If you understand the reasons for that pullback, then it provides security and confidence in your position.¬†\n\nFor example, right now we know that the coming pull-back is expect to be just a minor blip in an overall massive move higher that is likely developing and will develop in the coming months. It‚Äôs also to give anyone on the sidelines a window in which to make an entry into the market if they weren‚Äôt long to begin with.¬†\n\nAnd I think it‚Äôs really important to highlight just how critical security in one‚Äôs position really is. Reading through the NVDA-Stock Reddit page, I was surprised by the number of people who were almost shaken out of their position in NVDA all due to what was very obviously a regular correction. If you‚Äôre able to understand the difference been real risk to the markets and a relatively benign correction, you‚Äôre less likely to make emotionally driven or irrational decisions.¬†\n\nI had a few people mention to me in my inbox that they were almost shaken out of their position on¬†August 4-5 upon seeing the markets down 4% in overnight trading. NVDA pushed all the way down to $90 a share. But if you‚Äôve been through 30+ corrections over decades of trading, you start to get a real sense of what is a regular correction and what is a crash. It‚Äôs usually told in the volume and the size of the selling pressure early on in the correction. A regular correction slowly develops and then escalates as we arrive at capitulation. A crash or bear market typically begins with very heavy selling at the outset. See how the Covid crash in 2020 developed and how the 2022 bear market began for example. In both cases, we saw extreme selling almost immediately. There are also a wide number of key technical indicators that reach extremes. We saw none of that here. We didn‚Äôt even see a real distribution day. Not once in this past correction.¬†\n\nAnyway, the point here is that security is the point. The take away is to not get shaken if you see NVDA pull-back from $135 down to $120 or something. It‚Äôs all nonsense. And that brings me to the main point of this article.¬†\n\n# The New Rally Has Only Begun\n\nWe‚Äôve only just begun a new rally in the stock market. The typical rally lasts 40-trading days on average. During this recently secular bull run that began in December 2022 or January 2023, the segmented rallies have been significantly longer than usual. We‚Äôve had rallies that lasted 90 sessions, 70-sessions and 103 sessions. The most recent rally only lasted 40 sessions which is the typical average between corrections. We‚Äôre only at session 12 and we‚Äôve only moved up around 15%. You can expect the QQQ to rally a good 25-30% on this leg up. That‚Äôs another $60 or from here. NVDA is likely to move higher with the QQQ. It‚Äôs certainly not going to see market headwinds.¬†\n\nThat being said, one thing worth mentioning ‚Äî and we‚Äôll cover this in a separate post as it bears some attention ‚Äî there is the potential risk of this being a double-correction. In most cases, we get a correction, we get a bottom and the market simply sustains a v-recovery and we go on our merry way. That‚Äôs the typical situation in most corrections. But there have been some instances where we go back down and retest the lows. That could happen here. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs very likely as we‚Äôve seen a very convincing and robust move off the lows. That tells me we‚Äôre probably going to new highs. But anytime we get a near-term pull-back, we‚Äôre going to have to do some analysis on the selling pressure and make a determination on whether it‚Äôs a retest or just a minor blip. This upcoming pull-back we should see in the coming 1-7 days will give us a sense of that.

But it's important to keep in mind that earnings mostly impacts the stock near-term.  Unless something truly fundamentally shifting happens, earnings will only have a near-term impact and NVDA will continue ahead in its general direction.  A delay isn't a fundamental shift. It's a small blip.\n\nA fundamental shift would be like NVDA coming out and saying that it's customer's aren't making money and are likely scaling back spending in the future. That would be bad.\n\nWhat we saw this past month was driven by a market correction.  It wasn't just NVDA falling. The entire market was taking a huge beating.  A 16% correction to be exact.  When the market moves lower in a correction, bad news takes center stage.  But it's important to understand that it's not the bad news that drives the stock lower. It's the stock selling off in lock-step with the market that drives bearish sentiment which in turn points to bad news as the reason.\n\nWhen the market is rallying, bad news is brushed aside and any piece of good news is highlighted. It's very counter-intuitive.  But that's basically how it works.\n\nI bet everyone invested in NVDA during the months of July and August were under the belief that NVDA dropped 30% due to some specific fundamental reason. The reality is NVDA dropped due to the correction in the broad market. Otherwise, how else can anyone explain how NVDA magically just rallied 45% in lock-step with the QQQ rallying 16%.  The supposed bad-news we heard all last month is still there. And yet here's NVDA trading up to $130 a share from $90. That's a near 50% move higher right?  And for what reason exactly?  What news came out that can be attributed to that 50% move higher?  I forecasted that move back in August 4-5 right?  And that forecast was based on the market bottoming out.  Stated news items don't always connect to the stock price. The financial press can say whatever they want.  But they don't know what 100's of thousands of market participants are doing.  They don't know what the top 70 hedge funds are doing and their decision making processes right?  It's just one journalist publishing what they believe are the reasons for the drop in the stock price.", "score": 57, "replies": [{"body": "All makes a ton of sense.

Listen to what the Fed is saying and look at basic macroeconomic fundamentals rather than trying to find false correlations. This is far more illustrative: inflation down, therefore rates come down. \n\nLowering rates in the past has coincided with bear markets because the raised rates themselves caused the bear markets. That was the intended effect to bring down inflation. So rates were lowered to reverse something they caused, not to respond to something unrelated. \n\nThis time around the Fed has tried to bring down inflation with raised rates without causing a recession, using history as a guide to prevent a repeat of the 80s. Basically trying to not repeat a fuckup. \n\nIf rates stay high for too long then yeah there will be a recession eventually due to throttling economic activity. But rates coming down does not mean there is a recession starting. It means inflation is down. Mission accomplished. So let‚Äôs get in get out while we‚Äôre still unrecessed and keep the rally going.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "This is correct.  Right across the board.  I‚Äôll just echo what Capable_Wait09 has already said by adding there simply isn‚Äôt a large enough sample size here.  We don‚Äôt have all that many past historical events where the fed started cutting rates leading to a peak in the market.  \n\nAnd what‚Äôs more, the last few times we‚Äôve seen that happen, there were a lot of other things happening in the world.  \n\nFor example, in the Greenspan era, we had the housing bubble and financial crisis.  The fed was forced to cut rates due to the Fanny/Freddy fiasco back in the summer of 2007 and that eventually lead to the Bear Stearns collapse and ultimately the financial crisis. \n\nThe fed was behind the curve back then and it was ultimately their own doing.  The underlying problems were taking place as they were raising rates.  \n\nThis current fed had very legitimate reason for raising rates in 2022 and have equally legitimate reasons to begin cutting.  \n\nThe point here is that those two markets don‚Äôt quite match up.  \n\nWhat‚Äôs more, there was a very big lag effect between when the fed began cutting rates in summer 2007 and when the market peaked in late 2008.  It was a good 4-6 months between those two things.  \n\nCertain segments of the market peaked in January 2008 ahead of the Bear Stearns collapse.  The fed began cutting rates in Aug-September 2007.  But remember, the fed was hawkish up until August 2007 when credit conditions began tightening.  I remember that period well.  It was one of my best trades ever.  I got super long a basket of different stocks (January options) across the board in Aug 2007 and it all paid off by Nov 2007.  \n\nBut really various segments in market were in okay shape throughout much of 2008 even. In August 2008 (a year after the fed began cutting), all of the big tech stocks like google and Apple were within a few percentage pints of their highs only a single month away from the financial crisis.  \n\nThe character of the Bernanke fed and that economic environment was very different than today.  The Bernanke fed went from hawkish to dovish in a single month driven by rapidly deteriorating financial conditions.  \n\nThe Powell fed has largely been very dovish and these upcoming rate cuts have been expected for nearly 6-8 months now.  The Powell fed is by no means ‚Äúforced‚Äù like Bernanke had been.  \n\nIn 2007, it all happened very dramatically as the fed was forced to take action during a big market sell-off in August 2007.  \n\nAnd again, even in that situation, there was a big lag period between when the fed cut and when the market actually rolled over.  \n\nI make this point because I‚Äôve heard this whole thing before.  It‚Äôs a known trend in the market.  \n\nThe last thing I‚Äôll say on this is that this bull market is brand new.  It only just started in January 2023.  It‚Äôs not even 2-years old yet.  \n\nIn 2008, we were 5 years into the bull run before we peaked.

{"title": "Stocks Pull-Back a bit as Expected", "selftext": "[This article was first published at Sam Weiss](https://sam-weiss.com/stocks-sell-off-as-expected/).    \n  \nAs I mentioned a few days ago in the article entitled, ‚Äú[Sharp Short-Lived Sell-Off Coming](https://sam-weiss.com/sharp-short-lived-sell-off-coming/),‚Äù the market was trading at extremely overbought conditions and was due for a near-term pull-back. We‚Äôre seeing that play-out right now. The two main reasons I expected we‚Äôd see this pullback happen is:\n\n(1) the NASDAQ-100 (QQQ) index had reached extremely overbought conditions only the hourly for an extended period of time and after a large percentage gain.¬†  \n  \nThat second part is key and didn‚Äôt spend much time on that in the article I published a few days ago. So we‚Äôll talk about that here now. It‚Äôs not enough for the QQQ to simply touch a 70-RSI or to even to become overbought for us to make a reasonable forecast. For there to be ANY predictive value to forecast a sell-off, you need to see extremes for an extended period of time and it must come after there has been a strong 8-12% move higher off the lows.¬†  \n  \nYou can easily see the QQQ reach overbought conditions right off the lows and it wouldn‚Äôt be smart to forecast anything at that point. For example, the QQQ was trading at $423 two weeks ago when it was at its low. Suppose after it had rebounded up to $445, it reached overbought conditions. It would be incredibly unwise to forecast a pull-back when the market had only risen 4.96%. That‚Äôs because the rally had barely just begun and not enough new money will have flowed back into the market at that point. There‚Äôs a tendency for the QQQ to rally a good $50 off its lows before seeing any sort of pull-back when we‚Äôre talking about forecasting the first pull-back.¬†\n\nTake a look at the QQQ chart below as an example. Notice the vertical lines I‚Äôve annotated on the chart. They outline every previous case going back the last 15-months where the QQQ pushed well above a 70-RSI. You can see just how predictable the hourly RSI really is as a forecasting tool so long as it is taken in conjunction with other conditions. It‚Äôs not just guesswork here. There‚Äôs a pretty well established trend. Notice the red lines¬†\n\nA few things you might notice are (1) once we‚Äôve rallied a fair amount of the lows, overbought becomes more and more predictable. You can forecast big pull-backs once the QQQ has gone on a big move to the upside. The RSI has less predictive value as a tool when we‚Äôre coming off of the lows of a previous sell-off and more predictable as we‚Äôve risen quite a bit. In this case, I was confident in the forecast simply because the QQQ had rallied $62 from $423 up to $485. That‚Äôs actually the biggest rally I‚Äôve seen in a straight line without a pull-back. And that makes sense as we‚Äôve just had the largest sell-off we‚Äôve seen since the bear market lows of December 2022. So a huge rally makes sense.¬†\n\nThe second big thing that everyone should notice is that the QQQ seldom peaks when we‚Äôve peaked on the RSI. There‚Äôs usually a lag period where we get something called negative divergence. Don‚Äôt want to get too technical here. But just know it‚Äôs more likely to peak after a small lag period has taken place. For example, look at the may peak. We hit peak overbought conditions in mid-May but it wasn‚Äôt until late-May that the QQQ sold-off.¬†\n\n(2) The second main reason is the table I posted in the article that outlines what typically follows after a correction.¬†¬†As I outlined in that table, what we usually see after a correction ends is the QQQ will rally roughly 10-15% during the first 25 trading days after bottoming. Well this time the QQQ managed to accomplish that feat in just 10-12 days. It did it in roughly half the required time. What‚Äôs more, in virtually all of these post-correction rallies, we get a sharp-back before moving higher. And that‚Äôs because that first surge off the lows leads to overbought conditions. The bottom-line is the QQQ just went up too far too fast relative to its typical historical trading behavior. So that lead me to believe we were due for a sell-off. That table is posted here below:¬†\n\nBut as I also stated¬†[yesterday](https://sam-weiss.com/market-rally-has-only-just-begun/), the market rally that began on August 5 is only just beginning. This sell-off is only a minor blip in a much larger new rally. Nothing I saw today changes that. We‚Äôll see what happens tomorrow. But as of now, this sell-off doesn‚Äôt look like anything more than just a minor pull-back ahead of more upside. What‚Äôs more, we may actually drawing very close to end of this pull-back. If we get anywhere near a 30-RSI, then that‚Äôs the biggest red flag that the selling is over and we‚Äôre likely headed higher. The QQQ right now is at a 38-RSI. So we‚Äôre not quite there yet. But we‚Äôre very close to that point. The meat of the sell-off is pretty much done. The QQQ is down $10 from its high. The typical QQQ pull-back is 3-4% from peak to trough. We‚Äôre at 2.5% at the moment. Notice the circle on the chart below. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre thinking in terms of the pull-back. At this point, it can bottom at any moment. It doesn‚Äôt have to get down to oversold. It‚Äôs far less predictable at this point. If it were to bottom right here at $473.81, that would be sufficient. That‚Äôs $12 from the highs on the QQQ. It would feel shallow, but it‚Äôs enough.¬†\n\n# Nvidia (NVDA)\n\nNow obviously what we‚Äôre seeing in Nvidia is just mirroring what we‚Äôre seeing in the broad market. Nvidia is directionally correlated with the market. The pull-back in NVDA at this point is less than I would have expected. By today we should have seen Nvidia (NVDA) hit $120 if we‚Äôre going to see it fall to the $115‚Äôs before earnings. Now I think that is unlikely as the QQQ pullback doesn‚Äôt have much left in it. Now if the QQQ pull-back does go the way of 4% ‚Äî which again is totally in-line with historical trends ‚Äî then it‚Äôs very possible NVDA could get down there. But at this point, I think earnings is acting like a gravity well and offer some degree of protection against this pull-back we‚Äôre seeing in the QQQ.¬†\n\nAs to Nvidia (NVDA) technicals, the stock is not only no longer overbought, it is now nearing oversold conditions. It‚Äôs not there yet, but it‚Äôs getting very close to oversold conditions already. We closed at a 39.49-RSI on the hourly. Now NVDA does have a flare for the dramatic from time to time and might push down to a 20-RSI. We‚Äôve seen that happen seven (7) times in the past year. All seven instances preceded massive moves to the upside. And we‚Äôre talking immediate rallies afterward. Could it happen here? Maybe. I think it‚Äôs less likely due to the fact that we have earnings coming up next week. That will largely depend on how the QQQ trades tomorrow and Monday. But I do think Nvida does go back toward its highs by the time we arrive at earnings. Take a look at the NVDA chart below. Notice just how explosive oversold conditions are for Nvidia. Whenever NVDA gets down to oversold on the hourly, it explodes higher near-term.¬†\n\n# STOP TIMING THE MARKET!\n\nOne last thing I‚Äôd like to stress is that none of this above should really be about trying to time the market. I see a lot of comments on Reddit and in my inbox of people using this as a tool to make timed trades. That is almost certainly a losing proposition. I‚Äôll explain why in a more detailed and dedicated page to¬†[investing basics](https://sam-weiss.com/investing-basics/). Don‚Äôt write this off as some sort of empty adage. It‚Äôs not empty words. Trying to trade and/or time NVDA is playing with lava-level fire.¬†\n\nNow are there opportunities to enhance returns a little by using a very small subset of capital to leverage oversold trades. Sure. But core-position wise, you should just be long the stock and don‚Äôt think about it. There are ways to leverage and enhance your returns without getting screwed by being left on the sidelines. We‚Äôll get to that. If I were on the sidelines right now and wanted to get long NVDA, I would have bought half today minimum. Because at this point it could bottom at any moment. The QQQ has officially pulled back far enough for this to constitute an overbought pull-back by historical stands. 2.5% is on the small side, but it‚Äôs technically sufficient. So the next 1% of downside in the market is a high-risk forecast.¬†\n\nRemember, the point of this post is to help provide security, confidence and knowledge. It‚Äôs not really intended to trade on it. It‚Äôs meant to give investors added visibility to their positions and helps explain why certain gyrations are occurring.

The sell off wasn‚Äôt that much and a lot of this had to do with Jackson Hole.\n\nAs far as NVDA rallying today that was in line with J Powells dovish speech at Jackson Hole. This sort of movement is fairly consistent with economics data reporting and Fed speak. If you look at the other players in tech you will see a similar chart. AAPL chart looks almost identical to NVDA this AM. \n\nAs for the NVDA rally coming‚Ä¶that has a lot to do with Hyper-scalers reporting continued CAPEX spend on data centers this earnings season. It is generally considered that NVDA will beat and raise.\n\nHe is speaking more to historical trends and TA with QQQ and Nasdaq. The RSI on the 1D for NVDA was not horribly overbought. The RSI was in the 60‚Äôs and can be pegged above 80 for a few days before reversing. Which can be seen on the 1D chart for some of these big moves this year. The opposite is the RSI getting into the 20‚Äôs where an oversold condition tends to reverse fairly soon after on these Mega Cap stocks.\n\nSo to boil down his post in simple terms : RSI looking overbought, trends showing upside.\n\nKeep in mind historically the fall is bullish and extremely bullish post election. So if NVDA beats and confirms the Hyper-scaler CAPEX spend with increased revenue then yes it will rally just like it did last quarter. Going into the fall it could rally even more with the entire SP500 as rate cuts will most likely occur.\n\nThere is a little more at play here than technical analysis. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I use TA daily here. But news/economics plays into this as well as fundamentals.\n\nWhat was interesting and he has not responded to my comment on another thread. A few months ago he made a point of saying NVDA would be stuck in the 120‚Äôs because of the problem with reaching a 3 trillion market cap.

Here's why:\n\n1. **Opportunity Cost**: If your investments are returning over 20%, this is significantly higher than the typical mortgage interest rate, which might be around 3-6%. By paying off your house, you're essentially getting a guaranteed return equivalent to your mortgage interest rate, which is much lower than what your investments are yielding.\n2. **Compounding Returns**: The power of compound interest works more effectively with higher returns. By keeping your money invested in assets that generate 20% or more, you accelerate the growth of your wealth.\n3. **Leverage**: A mortgage is a form of leverage, allowing you to use borrowed money to invest elsewhere. If your investments are significantly outpacing your mortgage interest, it makes sense to maintain that leverage to grow your net worth faster.\n4. **Liquidity**: Investments are typically more liquid than home equity. If you pay off your house, that money is tied up in the property and not easily accessible without taking on new debt.\n\nHowever, this strategy assumes that your investments are relatively stable and can continue to deliver high returns. If there‚Äôs significant risk associated with those investments, it might be safer to consider a balanced approach‚Äîpartially paying down your mortgage while also investing.\n\nThis approach is also contingent on other factors, such as your risk tolerance, the security of your income, and your long-term financial goals.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wow dude, calm down.

{"title": "The AI Bubble is over, and Nvidia are going to eat shit on earnings", "selftext": "## Why is AI a bubble?\n\nBefore any of this will make sense you have to understand that our current approach to AI does not work and never will. I'm not saying AI is impossible and that we'll never build it, but the GPT/ML approach was a known dead end for decades in academic research. We didn't need modern technology to figure that out, you can do it with a slide rule and many did. All we're seeing now is what came of a bunch of idiot VCs deciding to try anyway, some of it is genuinely impressive but for the $400 billion that's went into it it's still catastrophically disappointing.\n\nThe business case for AI is dead simple: \"Hey there Manager, hiring staff is an expensive pain in the ass right? What if we made a computer that did their job for a tiny fraction of the price and always said yes?\". Think about the mindset of the C-suite and upper management of any major company. They didn't work their way up, they don't have professional expertise in whatever it is their company actually does. They're the accountants and lawyers who say things like \"just make it work\" and \"do more with less\". AI as promised is their dream, they can fire all their staff and never have to think about physical reality again, they think they'll be able to tell GPT 7.0 \"just make it work\" and it'll be so gosh dang smart that it can.\n\nIt's neat that OpenAI and a few other companies have built vaguely serviceable chatbots, it's neat that Midjourney can spit out cool pictures, but it's embarrassingly short of what investors were promised. Ford's executive team doesn't want to replace 40% of it's level 1 customer support team with ChatGPT, it wants to be able to end a board meeting by saying \"FordGPT, please design and start manufacturing next year's F150 model, make sure it's available in the usual colours plus moss green\" and it'll _just do it_. They don't want a search assistant, they want J.A.R.V.I.S.\n\nAnd GPT/ML can't do that, no matter how many GPUs you throw at it.\n\n## Why now?\n\nA ground rule for machine learning is \"exponential investment for linear gains\". That means exponential increases in training time, in compute, in training data, in storage, in power. Neither the world nor the economy is infinite and many of these are bumping into both of those.\n\n* [They're running out of training data](https://apnews.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-training-data-running-out-9676145bac0d30ecce1513c20561b87d). Llama 3 and GPT 4o's input training data is a 2-digit percentage of \"all words ever written by humans\".\n* [They're running out of power](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/03/07/ai-data-centers-power/).\n* [They're running out of money](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/openai-training-and-inference-costs-could-reach-7bn-for-2024-ai-startup-set-to-lose-5bn-report/).\n* ML-focused GPUs aren't seeing that much generation-to-generation improvement in terms of cost/power efficiency.\n\nBut most of all the investment levels are getting so high that even [major financial institutions](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/goldman-sachs-exchanges/a-skeptical-look-at-ai-investment) are starting to feel uneasy. Remember they don't want a search assistant, they want Jarvis, and as we enter year 9 of \"the next version will finally be it, trust me bro\" with stagnating improvement and not a single financially viable product to show for it, they want to see more results before signing off on the next trillion dollars in capex.\n\n## Why Nvidia?\n\nNvidia's importance within the AI ecosystem is grossly overstated. Their work on CUDA opening up GPUs for general-purpose computing tasks deserves a lot of credit for starting the broader machine learning gold rush, but that was a decade ago now. Today none of the software to train or run AI models is beholden to Nvidia's hardware. All of Microsoft's recent datacentre expansion has used [AMD Instinct cards, not Nvidia](https://www.amd.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-5-21-amd-instinct-mi300x-accelerators-power-microsoft-a.html). Microsoft are [already developing their own chips in-house](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/in-house-chips-silicon-to-service-to-meet-ai-demand/), as are [Meta](https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-deploy-in-house-custom-chips-this-year-power-ai-drive-memo-2024-02-01/), and both [Google](https://cloud.google.com/tpu?hl=en) and [Amazon](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/) have had their own deployed for years. Nvidia is merely a chip _designer_, not a manufacturer. They can design and market all the chips they want but the sector has grown large enough that it's a no-brainer for the real tech giants to vertically integrate.\n\nThe expectation is Blackwell selling faster than they can manufacture them for the next 2 years, the way Hopper has for the previous 2 years. Even if Blackwell is as big of an improvement over Hopper as promised ([which it probably isn't](https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/fresh-rumours-claim-nvidias-next-gen-blackwell-cards-wont-have-a-wider-memory-bus-or-more-vramapart-from-the-rtx-5090/)), and even if the delays aren't indicative of serious manufacturing problems with TSMC's 3nm process ([which it probably is](https://www.techpowerup.com/314452/samsung-and-tsmc-reportedly-struggling-with-3-nm-yields)), it's hard to see a winning formula.\n\nNvidia is a sound business long term, they've got a well-deserved dominant position in several markets, but their current valuation is based on future revenue estimates that not even the most bullish AI future could possibly deliver. With the confluence of so many factors, I think this is the quarter where the penny finally drops.\n\n## Are we in for a broader tech crash?\n\nPersonally, I think not. The tech bubbles that most of you will be familiar with are the financial ones comprised of shitty unprofitable startups that IPO and inevitably explode some time later. AI is more of a _tech_ bubble where its just the new hot thing tech bros are obsessed with. Rather, it's 40% of the new product development budget at the blue-chip tech giants. It's a waste of money that will no doubt result in corrections at some point, but that money mostly came from the revenue of existing profitable products. It was wasted on some stupid bullshit before, and it'll be wasted on some new stupid bullshit after.\n\nThe real hit in the medium term will be to \"shovel sellers\". Nvidia, AMD, TSMC, Equinix, Dell, HP, Supermicro, etc. Any company for whom those capex numbers are a considerable source of revenue.\n\n## tl;dr\n\nML/GPT-based AI is dumb, institutional investors have noticed, Nvidia's chips aren't special anymore, and tech giants are vertically integrating chip design anyway.", "id": "1f125zr", "created_utc": 1724607819.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.48, "num_comments": 146, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | just now\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 4 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I read your entire post including all the links.

So the upside is minimal and downside risks are elevated. \n\nNot something I'd take a huge position on, but worth unwinding long positions and maybe a speculative put or two in a large enough portfolio.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "The \"Jarvis is ridiculous\" only sounds silly if you've started paying attention to this in the last year or two. You can look up what folks like Sam Altman were saying 5+ years ago.

A year ago the entire field was bristling with excitement about AGI and superintelligence, it's a relatively recent development that they've walked expectations back.\n\nThey're just doing the \"fusion power is 5 years away thing\". Here's Sam himself talking down GPT-4 [2 months before it came out](https://www.theverge.com/23560328/openai-gpt-4-rumor-release-date-sam-altman-interview) and a couple months ago saying its [\"mildly embarrassing at best\"](https://x.com/rowancheung/status/1786227214570127666), and here's him saying largely the same thing [nearly 6 years ago](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/18/sam-altmans-leap-of-faith/).\n\nThe current thing is always \"good enough for some tasks\" and the true AGI future is just a few years away.\n\nThe issue isn't that it takes time, the issue is in 2020 when they released GPT-3 they'd raised less than $100m, and today they've raised over $13B, and they don't have a lot to show for that extra $12.9B. Sam's talking about [\"burning $50 billion a year to build AGI\"](https://x.com/tsarnick/status/1785838281671975136) and it's just got people wondering how many rounds we'll have to go on this before we get what's actually promised.

But GPT read and responded in <5seconds:\n\nThe critique you've provided rests on a few misconceptions and overlooks key aspects of AI's current trajectory and potential.\n\n1. **AI Approaches and Progress**: The critique dismisses the GPT/ML approach as a \"known dead end,\" but this perspective fails to account for the significant advancements these methods have already achieved. While it's true that current AI systems are not equivalent to human intelligence or capable of fulfilling science fiction-like fantasies (e.g., J.A.R.V.I.S.), this was never their immediate goal. The successes of GPT-3, GPT-4, and similar models in natural language processing, image generation, and other domains are impressive and provide immense value across industries.\n2. **Exponential Investment for Linear Gains**: The notion of \"exponential investment for linear gains\" is not unique to AI. Most technological progress, particularly in nascent fields, requires substantial investment before significant breakthroughs are realized. The idea that AI is stagnating is contradicted by ongoing improvements in model capabilities, optimization techniques, and the emergence of new architectures that continue to push the boundaries of what's possible.\n3. **Business Case for AI**: The critique argues that AI has failed to meet investor expectations by not delivering a fully autonomous system capable of complex tasks like designing cars. However, this expectation misunderstands the nature of AI development. AI is not meant to be an all-encompassing solution to every problem overnight. Incremental improvements, such as automating specific tasks, enhancing decision-making, and creating new products, are already transforming industries. The ultimate goals may be ambitious, but the journey itself is valuable and profitable.\n4. **Training Data and Resources**: Concerns about running out of training data or resources ignore the adaptability of AI research. Techniques like transfer learning, unsupervised learning, and more efficient model architectures help mitigate these challenges. Moreover, the development of specialized hardware, improved algorithms, and better data utilization strategies continuously address the resource-intensive nature of AI.\n5. **Nvidia‚Äôs Role**: While it's true that tech giants are moving towards vertical integration, Nvidia remains a critical player in the AI hardware ecosystem. The dominance of CUDA, the ongoing innovation in GPU architecture, and the importance of a robust software-hardware ecosystem are not easily replaced or replicated.

{"title": "Why Nvidia is undervalued", "selftext": "**Let me start with the conclusion (and that this isn't financial advice)**\n\n* My conservative price prediction for Nvidia is $164 in the next 12 months\n* Don't expect It a straight line rise, historic annual volatility for the stock is %45.37 (sample period 2010-01-01 to 2024-08-02 ) and this has been the case even when the stock traded in single digit prices.\n* I estimate topline revenue of \\~200b for CY2025 which is FY ending January 2026. This is approximately 0.2% of current total global GDP. This revenue estimate is more aggressive than Wall Street projections but i believe it'll be more accurate.\n\n**Why am i sharing this and who am I**\n\nI've been working in tech for the past 20 years, technical degree first and business school later. For the past 10 years working almost exclusively on various ML products in big tech companies (think meta, google, twitter). My job requires technical aptitude, so i'm not a marketing type and can see through the usual sales hype. I also understand the evolution of these types of products (s curve). At the same time my job also requires me to understand adoption cycles, how to commercialize technologies and to develop some sense for what markets are willing to pay for or not.\n\nI don't sell or do courses, lessons or ask you to sign up for anything. It's not my field and i have no interest in it either. I share for the intellectual challenge, to be helpful, and to leave a record of my predictions for accountability.¬†\n\nAs far as my valuation philosophy, i really don't care for P/Es and i think they are a very lazy and inaccurate way to try to understand how under or overvalued a stock is. If you've invested based on P/Es over the past decade you would have ended with slow growing stock that mostly went no where, and missed on all the opportunities that rapidly appreciate it. If you think people are overpaying for a stock, unless you have an insight that you think they don't, then consider that they might be overpaying for a reason, and no one is going to sell you a stock they think is valued at x for less.¬†\n\nI also don't bind any of my analysis on other psychological comforts like what size market cap a company is. All those are biased anchors. There are some herd-like convergence naturally on some of these things but none of them drive the value whatsoever. Consider that the total value of all the US stock market 50 years ago is now the same as a few of the biggest companies collective daily moves potentially. There is no rule that says a company needs to be capped at X market cap. Ultimately, the value of a company is the total area under the curve, the curve being the cumulative cash it can generate over time. There might be deviations here and there, there might be external market and macro effects that influence that, but ultimately things converge to cash generated and earnings.\n\nFinally, with respect to what's being done on Wall Street, and it serves its function, you have to understand that everything is a product of its context. The fact that an estimate comes from Wall Street is less indicative of the true value of a company and more indicative of just how Wall Street works. You have to consider the people who work in the industry, what's their background, what tools they use, what incentives they have .....etc . In the same manner that if you put something in a meet grinder you can predict what the output is going to look like, every industry has a systematic aspect to it that has a large impact on the output. This doesn't mean that the output is wrong, but it does mean that it is skewed and biased, and you have to contextualize against the bias to really make any use of it.\n\n**How did i come up with this estimate?**\n\nI took three different approaches and they all triangulated to $164 in next 12 months. I have a low/high value but i don't believe in caveated forecasts, my philosophy is a forecast is one figure that encapsulates total risk\n\n1. DCF model for the company using my growth assumptions based on my experience in the industry\n2. Estimating total AI spend and attributing how much of that will go to NVDA over the next 5 years. What i did here was list the top use cases for GPUs (beyond just LLMs) across 10 different sectors, to try to size the total spend in the AI market. I then broke that down as how i expect it to be allocated across the value chain from software costs, to operations, ML engineers, servers....etc and of course chips. I then further adjusted with assumptions on % market share that NVDA can capture within its segment of the value chain. This gives me potential total projected revenues that NVDA would earn that i then cross-referenced with the 5yr revenue projections from #1 above\n3. The last method is very crude but was more of a sanity check step, which is basically taking the total spend globally and calculating it as a percent of total global GDP just to see if it makes sense (i.e not too large) and it was indeed very reasonable in low single digit percentage.\n\nGenerally, the value driven from AI is going to come along 3 axes:\n\n* Productivity: Self explanatory but this is boosting the productivity of workers in various ways, the most obvious being LLMs like ChatGpt, Claude Sonnet, Opus, Lama...etc\n* Operations: The same thing that was previously done via programming or heuristic/rule based software, can be done using ML in a more cheaper to maintain and improve manner.\n* Quality/Innovation: Complete new innovations as a result from AI. Early on i expect these to come from AI as a tool facilitating discovery, in the future when we get closer to \"super AI\" it's the AI innovating.\n\nIn my estimation i took a conservative approach where i estimated AI spend that would be paid for by cost savings alone, i didn't even factor too much innovation and new use cases unlocked that would open up new markets. I'm confident that those will come along but maybe not in the next year, and frankly the possibilities are so wide and wild that i don't think i can estimate it with any reasonable confidence level so it's pointless to do so.\n\nI'm fairly confident in my estimate, but keep in mind nothing is ever 100%. And a recession could drastically influence this as it would impact overall spend. As of right now i think it's extremely unlikely for it to drop below 80 (P.S this analysis was before the recent market correction), but it is possible. If there is a miss the market will overreact, if there is geopolitical threat the market will overreact. The antitrust stuff i'm not worried about at all, these companies always navigate those issues with very minimal impact when looking at medium and long term. In a way, the risks for NVIDIA are the risks of the market in general, not a lot specific to the company itself. Regarding China and Taiwan, i recognize this as a risk factor but i will say this, i'm not the most savvy political thinker but i think if China wanted to invade Taiwan they would have already. I also don't think it's the US keeping them \"in check\" frankly as much as it is their own regional politics and alliances.\n\nNvidia is the strongest in the space, it's the most differentiated, best managed, best supply chain, best vendors, and best sales channels. What they have is years ahead of anyone else with nothing in immediate sight (next 2 years at the very least) changing. They are also recognizing the value of creating an ecosystem and tightly integrated full compliment of hardware<>software for an unbeatable proposition. Other generic manufacturers aren't close, and typical tech companies who have a use for it are only creating narrow hardware very specific to what they do.\n\n**What will happen on earnings day?**\n\nI don't know. My best guess is next earnings is going to be good, after that there might be 1 or maybe 2 earnings that might relatively disappoint, and then up from there. This is based on the the timing i think it'll take for users to start showing the type of results they are getting from their AI related spend. They won't be fully baked in time but will be directionally clear enough to give reassurance. That said, playing earnings is a gamble. You never know who is holding what and how they will react and what information they have, it could go up it could go down.\n\n**Why this bullish and how did you justify this?**\n\nThis all has to do with what AI is about and can do. There is a lot of misunderstanding and and misrepresentation. Just because something appreciates rapidly does not mean it's a bubble, it could be or not, you have to look at the reason of it appreciating. A penny stock getting shilled by a celebrity? Very likely a bubble. A company coming out saying they've tripled their earnings? Not a bubble. Anyways let's talk about AI a bit.\n\n\\~AI Performance Vectors\\~\n\nAI itself is not new, it's user-friendly and usable AI that is new. AI as a concept has been around since the 50s (Professor Marvin Miskey was one of the pioneers in the field, i've also been fortunate enough to sit in a class of his when he was still with us and teaching). The pivotal point in my opinion was around 2016, which is when a new paradigm of computing first became a reality, when the final piece of the puzzle was put in place (GPUs). In my estimation, AI was enabled piece by piece in the following order\n\n1. The algorithms and concepts of machine learning and its various subfields (1950s till today, advancing over time)\n2. Training Data (2000 was the early innings of being able to curate large training data sets, 2010s is when it really picked up)\n3. Compute power (2016 GPUs)\n\nThat's all AI is, data, algorithms and compute power. I first used ChatGPT model (1) around 2018. The model was incomprehensible and i would say had no utility whatsoever. It was really more like a proof of concept. It had none of the level of reasoning that current day LLMs do, and the output was comparable perhaps to a pre-schooler, which is to say very basic in logic, full of grammatical, spelling and syntax errors. Now consider that GPT-3 in around 2023 was what blew everyone's mind away, in a short period of 5 years the improvement went from a pre-schooler to what is roughly the comprehension and ability of a high school grad or even bachelors college candidate.\n\nSuch improvements are not minor step changes, that are order of magnitude (10x) improvements stacked on top of each other. It's hard to comprehend how something like this scales. Not only this, this rate of progress, as of today is still fairly predictable, as in there are no limitations in sight for the next 4-6 years that that would hinder this rate of progress. At this rate, it's highly likely that 2-4 years from now these models will have the reasoning ability and general proficiency and competence of a top level PhD candidate from the best schools on earth. In mere seconds it'll give you what a PhD could do in a month. I'm almost certain of this because of the various improvement vectors and their yet untapped range. For example:\n\n* Compute (probably the biggest vector)\n   * Net compute power will likely increase 20x between now and then (i define net computer as the combination of the increase in raw GPU power as well as improvement in algo efficiency)\n* Data\n   * Most LLMs are currently trained on internet data, a lot of that can be low quality. There is work in progress to create custom high quality data sets (think articles from PhD students, inventors....etc)\n   * There is research and experiments on filling data gaps using extrapolation to increase the density of data\n   * Deeper learning cycles. To give an example, if you as a human are learning a text book you tend to digest chapter by chapter and progress as you build your knowledge. Machine Learning as more akin to skimming the book end to end in layers, which each layer adding more knowledge. There are ongoing experiments to optimize the level of learning considering both approaches.\n* Algorithms\n   * Algos currently operate in a general manner and have almost zero information about the context. Imagine being able to tie in several sources from your work, your role, goals...etc and have that aid the answers\n   * More integrated across applications beyond just access to a web browser¬†\n   * Improvements in memory management\n\nThe rate of progress is so rapid, to the point that the benchmark tests that are often though of is highly difficult and would take years to pass are being blown out in months with constant need to reset the standard. These are different benchmarks that have to do with problem solving, reasoning ...etc, think of them as tasks and problem sets that you ask the AI to solve and you compare the AI score to human ability levels.\n\n**\\~AI Applications\\~**\n\nTo make this a bit more fun, and demonstrate the \"AI is not just ChatGPT\", here are a couple of examples. In this¬†[paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec22summer_genkin.pdf)(2022) researches built an audio classifier that can processes the built in computer microphone of an online game opponent's microphone, and based on the electronic noise from the machine use that noise to know where they were on a Counter-Strike map.¬†\n\nAnother¬†[example](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3002176)¬†is playing the Pink Floyd song \"Another Brick in the Wall\" to an experiment subject who has electrodes snickered to their scalp, and using only the electric activity data from the brain while its hearing the song they were able to reconstruct the song in an audio files. The song isn't 100% the same but very close and certainly identifiable.¬†\n\nThere are so many more examples and applications of different flavors i just happen to be into music and audio in my free time and these two i find fascinating. But my recommendation if you wish to know what's going on in the field is to forget Wall Street articles and read papers like these. Not every experiment is going to be a commercial successes, but these will help widen your perspective on the activity in the space. In any case imagine that there is a world of information out there which can be accessed if you only had the right interface. Just like there is data flying around in the air that is captured by a wifi card and a computer.\n\n**\\~Pace and Incentives\\~**\n\nI made the comparison earlier to pre-school, high school and PhD level performance. I didn't even mention that to \"incubate\" PhD level performance from one single person you need \\~ 26 years, and the amount of people who have the ability to perform this task are limited. Imagine that you can spin up this level of performance by instantiating a process of an AI agent with one line? This is exactly why unlike many other technologies, industry and not academia is the driving force behind AI research, the returns are just too large to not pursue. Let's take a look at this data for example (From¬†\"AI Index Report 2024\"):\n\n* in 2022: Industry produced¬†32 significant machine learning models, while academia produced only¬†3.¬†\n* In 2023: Industry produced¬†51 significant machine learning models, while academia produced¬†15. There were¬†an additional 21 models¬†resulting from collaborations between industry and academia which represented a new high for such partnerships.\n\n**Use Cases and Applications:**\n\nI quote some studies here and there but i mostly wanted to list to show the breadth of applications of AI. There are many more i haven't listed. But my point in this is not to enumerate every single possibility, but rather show the potential of possibility. The possibility of a path to 3,4 even 5 trillion market cap and where such spend could potentially come from.\n\nGeneral Task Productivity\n\n* Assisted software developers to complete programming tasks around 55% faster (Peng et al., 2023)\n* Access to a generative AI assistant allowed customer support agents to resolve 14% more issues per hour (Brynjolfsson et al., 2023)\n* General error reduction compared to human driven tasks within set categories\n\nFinance and Insurance\n\n* Fraud\n* Price optimization¬†\n\nHealthcare:\n\n* Drug discovery¬†and simulating drug interactions and efficacy\n* Radio imaging diagnosis\n* Personalized medicine\n\nOperations and Supply Chain:\n\n* Predictive maintenance\n* Resource allocation\n\nEnvironmental:\n\n* Energy optimization and management\n\nSecurity:\n\n* Enhancing cybersecurity measures through real-time threat detection and response.\n* Physical security monitoring and response\n\nAccessibility:\n\n* Improving accessibility for individuals with disabilities through AI-powered tools like voice recognition and text-to-speech\n\nCreative Industries:\n\n* AI in content creation, music composition, and visual arts.\n\nEducation:\n\n* Personalized learning experiences, AI tutors, and intelligent content delivery.\n\nTransportation:\n\n* Advancements in autonomous vehicles and optimized traffic management systems.", "id": "1f1cu94", "created_utc": 1724637174.0, "score": 185, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "Tldr\n\n\n#BULLISH", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you very much.

Or maybe even any revenue? These are essentially a speculative investment on Nvidia's part. Hard to imagine this is what will take the revenues to $200B. Anyway we already know that the bulk of Nvidia's revenues come from a handful of major customers i.e. the hyperscalers.\n\n> Saying the market size is limited by the cash flow of their customers is like saying the economy transactions are limited to printed paper and deposits\n\nNot \"printed paper and deposits\", the cash flows are also not paper cash. But replace that with \"fiat money\" and your statement has more merit. Now, what remains is credit/debt.  For complicated reasons, the economy runs on lots of debt. Nvidia and their customers are extremely profitable, but yeah in order to keep revenues increasing beyond a certain point, someone will have to take on debt. And if that happens, the valuation comes into question from a different perspective. \n\nHowever, if there is massive ROI in AI, this could change things. I think this is what a lot of people are betting on. But, there is limited evidence of it so far.\n\nHere's another very important thing to mention - Chip spend is for the building out of infrastructure. The spend grew rapidly due to the ramp up in AI efforts. But the chip spend doesn't need to accelerate forever. Even if the annual chip sales stall at $100B/year, AI capacity will still be increasing as more chips get deployed.

If AI is the future, the AI companies like Meta and Google will do very well. The web services companies like Amazon and Microsoft will do very well (these requests need to go somewhere). The companies selling you phones and computers to access AI will do very well. The banks with AI to reduce lending risks will do very well. The companies building productivity tools will do very well (Salesforce, Adobe).\n\nIn other words, if you truly believe \"AI\" is what you claim it will be, a broad index fund will still capture a large amount of gains, without the Concentration Risk. If the picture you're painting turns out to be true, somebody invested in QQQ or S&P 500 will continue to see >15% CAGR for the next decade, which is plenty enough to make most investors happy.\n\nThis isn't even true for previous hypes. If EVs turned out to be the future, only the EV companies will reap the benefits, not the rest of the market. If Web3 was to replace Web2, then owning Meta stocks wouldn't have done you much good.\n\nAnd there is always Concentration Risk, no matter how good the company. Production might not scale after a certain point. Look at how everyone is begging for new planes and Airbus can't take advantage because they can't build planes fast enough. Look at how NVidia themselves couldn't fill shelves for months during the Bitcoin mining hype. Or large companies may decide to build their own vertically integrated stacks. Sure, hardware performance may not match NVidia's. But anyone who's used an iPhone knows the power of vertically integrated products, meaning the end result can vastly outperform even superior hardware. Or all of NVidia's employees could lose motivation to improve after becoming millionaires. Or Jensen could be in a car accident or be discovered to be best friends with Jeff Epstein. Or China can invade Taiwan.

I've been doing it less lately since people didn't seem interested in it and would rather just see rocket emojis or wonder why stock is going down lol.\n\nThis means potentially hearing about both positive/negative things that might make the stonk go up/down in the short to medium term.\n\nMy main goal is to not lose money and that might be different than other peoples' goals here.

My thought process is that no one knows if the stock is going to move up or down or by how much. What you can kinda track is where momentum is going and probabilities of outcomes as MM prices things in. But no matter what, time passes (theta decay). This is why I mainly sell options, both calls and puts. However I do also buy some calls and puts when IV is low to protect against the moons and dooms.\n\nThis has allowed me to be up 25% or so YTD despite starting the year with TSLA like 75% of my portfolio (I also shorted NVDA for a while but have made up for that mistake lol). As long as Tesla is doing well, I aim to keep it (or any other single stock position) no more than 50% of my portfolio going forward.

Inflation has been settling down and their focus less on inflation and more on jobs. NFP is next Friday so probably the thing to watch. Also keep in mind Monday is a stock market holiday. Then also, today is end of August so prepare for some shenanigans for potential monthly rebalancing of stuff.\n\nAs for TSLA, today and next week max pain is $210. With the way current options are positioned, more than likely will end today there +/- $2.5. The wrench next week is a high amount of interest in the $215 and $220 calls. If there's positive momentum and call volume, those can act as a magnet and possibly drag the share price to those strikes. Then as time passes, those can decay and then end next week right back to $210 if they don't stay ITM. All depends on volume and macro sentiment since there's no Tesla catalyst until 10/2 deliveries, 10/10 robotaxi, then earnings.\n\nMedium term, max pain for the 9/20 opex is currently $200. That'll change as it gets closer. Also MM currently pricing in $20 move from now until then so basically expecting $185-225 from yesterday's close.\n\nSo how do I use this to sell calls and puts? There's no real huge TSLA catalysts, MM pricing in $12ish move next week or $196-220. Then since that's where all those call strikes are next week, selling the $230C+ should be \"safe\" since that's basically the priced in MM move from the high interest call strike.\n\nThen the $230C is around 7 delta or a 7% probability of happening. Going to the put side, that's about the same as the $185P.

He also said it was \"not possible to understand\" the investors' market manipulation and insider trading claims.**\n\n>Hellerstein dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice, meaning it cannot be brought again.\n\n  \nThere doesn't seem to be much else of note recently.
