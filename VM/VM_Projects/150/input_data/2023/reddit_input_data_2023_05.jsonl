I'm copying/pasting some of the more interesting paragraphs here:\n\n> The full shock of monetary tightening by the Fed has yet to hit. A great edifice of debt faces a refinancing cliff-edge over the next six quarters. Only then will we learn whether the US financial system can safely deflate the excess leverage induced by extreme monetary stimulus during the pandemic.\n\n> A Hoover Institution report by Prof Seru and a group of banking experts calculates that more than 2,315 US banks are currently sitting on assets worth less than their liabilities. The market value of their loan portfolios is $2 trillion lower than the stated book value.\n\n>The White House baulked at a blanket guarantee for all deposits because that would look like social welfare for the rich. Besides, the FDIC has only $127bn of assets (and less very soon) and may ultimately require its own bailout. \n\n>The horrible truth is that the world’s superpower central bank has made such a mess of affairs that it has to pick between two poisons: either it capitulates on inflation; or it lets a banking crisis reach systemic proportions. It has chosen a banking crisis.", "id": "135vgyu", "created_utc": 1683050614.0, "score": 539, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 147, "comments": [{"body": "Ambrose Evans-Pritchard is quite the doomer and he has predicted at least 40 recessions and crisis since 2008.

Well immediately after that a whale at JP was seen selling 500,000 shares on the whale watcher app. This whale selling out seems reasonable correct? WRONG, after checking senator listing Nancy pelosi purchased roughly 20 million equivalent in shares instantaneously after the sell off of this whale. Still not seeing the connection? Well if it wasn’t obvious enough Nancy pelosis husband works at JP Morgan and he most certainly sold off those shares to tax harvest his losses on Rivian, this may seem ok until you remember that tomorrow is thurday and apple earnings effect is on Friday which means that Nancy told Jpow to tank the market or at least make it seem like a whale would want to sell off a large portion to offset suspicion.

This is because your system is inherently flawed. \n\nAlso, you're not using a market cap to GVA model because that is a model used to value the S&P or american business as a whole and simply cannot be applied to a single business, as a single business does not have a GVA number in the same way it does not have a GDP number. I've just read Hussman's blog post, introducing market cap/GVA, and he talks exclusively about using it to value the S&P. Also, don't know how relevant it is, but Hussman has returned about 2% a year over the past decade so I don't know if it would be wise to listen to him. \n\nAs for the last bit about Buffett and Munger - in the first quote, Buffett is talking about the DCF model. He is making a comedic parallel between Aesop's quote and the correct way to value something, the DCF. \n\nIn the second quote, Munger is talking about how, while DCFs are correct in theory, they are not useful to the investor in practice (so long as you understand the concept behind them - which is that future cash flows are worth less than present ones, and that a business is worth the present value of its future cash flows). I agree with this - while DCFs are technically correct, they are not hugely helpful and I haven't physically written one out in years. Understand, though, that what Buffett (along with all good investors) is doing in his head is effectively an imprecise DCF. That's what the next couple quotes are about, too. That using a DCF gives the illusion of accuracy via precision in your maths, when the real source of uncertainty is the business's future prospects. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd now for a quick bit of honesty - I have never argued with anyone quite so infuriating as you.

{"title": "The 10 golden rules of Trading! although why I am posting this here....", "selftext": "Not that any of you degenerates will listen to this and I fully expect to get 100% downvotes but here goes anyway\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bfcyawgqteza1.jpg?width=271&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b556af3d7aa1003292d9a73bc8694170d25aeb18\n\nTHE 10 GOLDEN RULES OF TRADING\n\nI've been in the option business for a very long time and you cannot learn the skill of trading overnight. To be a master it takes years and TBH, I certainly cannot claim to have mastered options, but I do know them. When you do progress to becoming a consistently profitable trader it can be a very rewarding experience and I have learned along the way that there are certain rules that need to be adhered to. Some, you may think are obvious but I can tell you, I have seen other people break every single one and everyone will likely have done at least one of them at one point, if you end up doing this long enough...\n\n1. MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS!\n\nDo not enter a trade just because someone else told you to! Do your own research, you need to know everything about the trade you are entering,\n\n2. ALWAYS TRADE WITH A STOP LOSS OR MAX LOSS IN MIND.\n\nBefore you enter a trade , already KNOW what you are prepared to lose on it and it should ALWAYS be less than you are hoping to make. (I would suggest as a guide that your loss should be no more than 50% of what you are hoping to make. Your stop loss can either be set based on technical, events or based on your affordability. It should basically reflect the loss that you are willing to accept to lose on a position. Irrespective of whether you are trading on the long side or on the short side, always you need to have that level where the position is just wrong and you need to have that discipline to exit a loser. (The only addendum I would add to this is that with equities or futures, you can put in an electronic stop which once placed, takes out the emotion of having to exit yourself, however, I would advise not to put it (stop-loss) in on an electronic platform option strategy, because it will likely get triggered when it shouldn't have due to liquidity. In this instance, if you have a system that can evaluate your option position at any given time, you will be able to see where the value is, so just know where your stop-loss level is and if your theo value gets there then you have to have the discipline to get out.) Which brings me to...\n\n3. DISCIPLINE!\n\nDo not move your stop-loss. If it gets triggered, accept it and walk away. The same can be said for booking profits. Profit is what is booked; all else is book profits. Keep taking your money off the table at regular intervals. There is NOTHING WRONG with making a profit. YOu may see something go further afterward, but that's fine, you have MADE MONEY and that's all that counts. I personally would use a trailing stop, which moves up along with my profitable trade.\n\n4. NEVER LET A WINNING TRADE TURN INTO A LOSING ONE.\n\nAs I mentioned above, I have used a stop that moves up with my winners (eg; I book the profit if it retraces 10% off any recent high if it hasn't got to my target) but once clear and in the money at the very least put in a stop that will get you out for no loss.\n\n5. NEVER CHASE/ADD TO A LOSER\n\nDo not add to your position if your position is losing and you cant bear to take a loss, this is not a winning strategy. If your strategy is to average into a trade over a price range then that is totally fine, but doubling down in the hope the market will turn will burn you to the ground eventually.\n\n6. DON'T LOOK BACK IN ANGER\n\nThis is very important especially if you have had to book a loss. Traders tend to look back and over analyse. Also, when traders book profits and the stock goes further up, they tend to look back at the notional losses. Both are not advisable as they tend to detract from your core trading strategy.\n\n7. DON'T OVERTRADE/TRADE OUT OF BOREDOM.\n\nNot trading is also a strategy. This is something most traders tend to miss. Traders believe that trading strategy either means to buy or to sell in the market. But the most productive strategy can be to not do anything. This is very relevant when the market is very confusing and traders can get hit either way. Have your own plan and STICK TO IT!\n\n8. COSTS SHOULD BE CALCULATED INTO YOUR STRATEGY\n\nRemember, when you trade your cost is not just the brokerage you pay. There are all kinds of other charges like stamp duty, turnover tax, exchange fees etc. If you take delivery of shares, there are also expenses related to your account. The point being, that I know of traders who have grossed over $2mil at a firm and seen every penny of it eaten up by costs. And then there is margin. For all of you options and futures traders and anyone else who trades on margin, you should have a good understanding of how changes in a position may require more money to maintain them, even if they are doing well. All these costs and how margin changes (how much capital you'll need to maintain the position) over time need to be factored in when you project your trading profits and entering the trade.\n\n9. BE AWARE OF OVERNIGHT RISK\n\nDecide on a strategy that you like and stick with it market. Positions are normally intraday or for a few days. One of the biggest risks you need to be conscious of if the overnight risk. When there is uncertainty on the economic or geopolitical risk or there is a major event coming up, it is always advisable to be as light in the market as possible or at least understand what you really have at risk if things go pear-shaped but you're not there to do anything about it.\n\n10. STAY ON THE SIDE OF MOMENTUM\n\nWhen you are a trader, trend is your friend. You are more likely to make money as a trader if you trade according to the momentum. Trying to short a bull market does not make sense. Similarly, trying to catch a falling knife is also not the right idea. You trading strategy should be aligned to the direction of the momentum.\n\nRemember that there is NO WISHING, HOPING OR PRAYING. This isnt a game, you are here to make money. Decide on a strategy that you like and stick with it. If you stick to rules, learn from your mistakes, be humble and respect the market and you will become a successful trader.\n\nsource: [https://www.leviathanfm.com/blog/golden-rules](https://www.leviathanfm.com/blog/golden-rules)", "id": "13fmmo9", "created_utc": 1683901387.0, "score": 476, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 148, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|9|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|7|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: 1.

Now we get to see if they were right.\n\n5) Hype generally creates a scenario of \"sell the news\". Everyone is aware that the AI hype caused an enormous jump in share price, and that's highly unlikely to be reflected in higher revenue in the short term.\n\nThere are other reasons but these are the main ones. I'm also a big believer that each technology has a limit. How we get to the next level is by adapting an implementing a new technology or new variation of an older one. Moore's Law is still validated at the moment, but I think we are coming very close to a point where it breaks. Even something as small as atoms doubling every two years would eventually fill a limited space. It's illogical to assume that Moore's Law won't be broken, the question is when. But from industry leaders, it's being reported that they're starting to see the end here. It's getting more difficult by the day and the people who were saying Moore's Law would go on forever eventually began saying maybe 10 more years, and now are saying perhaps 5.\n\nThe new technology that can come in and save the day looks to be chiplets. Unfortunately, Nvidia dropped the ball there and are kind of catching up now. AMD got on the chiplet train a little earlier, and they do have a lead in that one area.\n\nWhy is that important? In the long term, I think restructuring of manufacturing chips is going to be an enormous disruptor. In the short term it means allocating more capital to developing a newer technology. That's very cost intensive and could affect the bottom line of semiconductor companies over the next few years.\n\nIt's all a guess of course. But there is too much negative with Nvidia itself right now to ignore.

You are correct.  However the company forecast coming out of that down cycle by the end of last year, 2022.  It's now Q1 they're reporting.   The big indicator here was the GM forcast was moving from low 60s to mid to high 60%.\n2.  The \"engine\" driving nvidia growth is not gaming, it's data center, specifically computation for AI training.  The biggest customers do not have enough of the latest GPUs.   Sam Altman (CEO Open AI) testified in to the US Congress last week he \"can't get enough GPUs.\"\n3. You don't mention Data Center, their biggest segment.   It should come in between $4.5B-$5B in revenue this quarter.  The biggest customers are Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google, Facebook, Google.  These guys are slowing down orders to Intel, not to Nvidia.  Automotive is rising, but not significant, it will turn in \\~5-7% of revenue of data center.\n4. Guidance last quarter increased 8% q/q to $6.5B.   Please explain what was \"not great\" about that.\n5. Hype is a difficult issue to quantify because it is subjective.    Indications are their data center GPUs are sold out through the end of the year.   \n\nNot sure what you think you know about chiplets, but NVIDIA VP GPU Engineering Jonah Alben says that monolithic chips are best if your company can build them and that's why he's sticking with them.  I'd believe him over what AMD thinks simply because AMD aren't winning anything right now in GPU.  In fact, their market share continues to shrink.   So why would anyone believe their approach is correct?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "1) Industry-wide GPU sales figures released just two weeks ago have reported that growth is still slowing.\n\n2) I can't see how recent AI hype could be reflected in this quarter, a point I already made. It takes time to ramp up productions to meet new demand.\n\n3) I don't mention data centers because I know that segment is likely to be strong. It doesn't take enormous slowing across the board to make a dent in the stock price. If they are simultaneously recording slowdowns across multiple sectors, in addition to an increase in data centers, does this warrant a tripling of the share price in a matter of months?\n\n4) 8% is a significant drop from past guidance. It's also a lofty goal. A PE of 150 typically demands more than 8% Q/Q growth.\n\n5) Again, does this justify such an enormous share price increase? You seem to be looking at price action possibilities through a lens that does not put significant enough emphasis on the fact their share price has tripled recently. That puts a lot of strain on expectations.\n\nRegardless whether chiplets are a solution or not, Nvidia is actually investing heavily there. If they were certain there'd be no significant need for them, they wouldn't be trying to compete there. That competition requires a lot of capital, which they are deploying now. If anything the argument that chiplets aren't so necessary only bolsters my point, because it indicates that Nvidia is spending a lot of capital on a technological change that won't bear much fruit for them.\n\nWe clearly disagree a bit here. That's okay. However so far I'm the only one to admit that this is a guess, only an opinion, and anything could happen.

You could say it's been \"expensive\" by traditional metrics since 2016, yes, but now it is *particularly* expensive - [the most expensive price-to-sales ratio it has ever had in history](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/price-sales) \\- and in a rising interest rate environment.   I like to keep it simple and use price-to-sales ratio as a metric when making a bearish argument (as opposed to P/E ratio that others use), because (1) it is generally less lumpy and prone to accounting distortions than P/E ratio, and (2) it allows for more generous assumptions to argue against (i.e. - looking at top-line revenue with an \"even if we assume that expenses are minimal and profit margins are great, it is still very expensive\" lens to make a bear case).\n\nAnd this may be a dumb hot take here, but I don't think *any* MEGA-CAP company trading at over 20x P/S ratio (such as Nvidia) should be owned as a \"long term investment\" ever ever ever.

In late August 2021, 14 unfinished apartment buildings were demolished in Kunming, Yunnan Province.\n\nThe developer had run into financial difficulties and abandoned construction. After the buildings went unattended for seven years, it was decided that they should be demolished out of safety concerns. In less than a minute, they collapsed into piles of rubble. It was an unsatisfying end for the massive project.\n\nChina's real estate market has been rocked by the kind of problems facing China Evergrande Group. President Xi Jinping, who has hailed the nation internationally as \"Great China,\" is slowly and quietly starting to act in order to save face. One of the main tasks is dealing with the empty developments known as \"ghost towns.\"\n\nBut some worry that these developments are just the tip of the iceberg. Data clearly show anomalies in the Chinese real estate market.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Lol.  Ghost cities have long been debunked since they were completely misunderstood a decade ago.  Since then, none of the reported ghost cities have remained empty, though new developments are still being built prior to being occupied.  \n\nThere's this thing called \"planning\".  In this case, China builds developments for huge numbers of people and doesn't move anybody in until the construction is completed.  This allows them to set and enforce standards for power, communications and other utilities so that those things aren't being slap-dashed together later.  It's cleaner, less risky and more efficient.  If you've ever been anywhere in Thailand, you would see exactly the problem with not planning anytime you look at any utility pole in the whole fucking country.  It's a nightmare.\n\nMy job in the US is to literally go around the country and unfuck the utility issues that have sprung up around not properly planning communities.  The US power grid is plagued with radial lines and all manner of line tapped distribution networks that can't sectionalize at all.  Chinese developments are avoiding all of these issues and many others including insufficient sewer systems, water systems, drainage, grading, and so on.\n\nYou are just repeating bullshit that has long been debunked.  And the article you quoted makes not only the same mistake, but commits a new one.\n\n14 buildings in an already established tier 2 (read: major) city in China is not and could not be a \"ghost city\".  It's a development within an already existing major city.  You, as a clearly overly sinophobic westerner who'll buy anything negative about China, grab the phrase \"ghost city\" and run with it, because confirmation bias.  \n\nOn to the meat of it, this development ran out of money a decade ago.  It has sat unfinished at some intermediate phase of construction for 10 years.  It's a safety hazard.  Nobody has come along to finish it and the company that started it was unable to get the capital required to complete the work.  The decision to demolish it was made lucidly and with the laudable reason of public safety.  Why you can't accept that and instead need to fabricate some bullshit that they are padding GDP is fucking ridiculous and someone needs to say that to you.  China doesn't need to pad its GDP.  It's already accepted by every economist in the world as the greatest economic miracle in the history of mankind.  But your position is that somehow, 14 decade old buildings in Kunming are the proof of some widespread conspiracy.  K.\n\nChin enjoys a nearly 900 billion dollar per year trade surplus.  They have the most modern cities in the world.  They have the largest educated population in the world and graduate an educated workforce equal to the entire US educated workforce every 4 years.  They lead in 37 of 44 critical emerging technologies.  They have so much pull around the world that even the mighty US cannot do anything but talk shit and then walk it back.  Even as China puts together a system that undermines the hegemony of the dollar, the US must sit back and let it happen, because real economic power resides in the east now.  Get used to it.

But in today’s market if there were signs that Intel is turning it around I wouldn’t be surprised if most of the ‘pop’ happened immediately after a good earnings announcement or in a couple of days later. So I’d say it might be closer to 50% based on what happened with some companies recently.

This is an issue really every where for Intel where to get their products sold they have had to take substantial hits on margins.  \n\nThe other thing is chiplet design on most of AMD’s products means that it’s much cheaper and more efficient for them to make working CPU’s making prices easier to slim down on, making margins lower for Intel if they want to stay competitive. \n\nOther than MobileEye Intel really isn’t doing fantastic anywhere.
