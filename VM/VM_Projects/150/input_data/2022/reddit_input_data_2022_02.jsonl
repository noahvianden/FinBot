Like ZERO many days. There are still market makers putting out bid/ask spreads, but those spreads are going to be pretty wide. If you are sued to trading short term AAPL or SPY options with spreads of a few pennies…get ready for spreads of $10-$20 on leaps for something like GOOG. \n\n- daily pricing in the leaps in your brokerage account (ie the value that your broker is going to calculate for you) can sometimes - due to the wide spread - not really reflect what the true “market” price is for that contract. Especially if someone puts in a bid/ask way outside of where the market makers are setting the spread. (Sometimes your broker will value the contract right on the highest ask or lowest bid, depending on whether your position is long or short, and a wonky bid or ask can really give you a weird temporary value). \n\nAll that said - my guess today is that the leaps I hold will go up 50-70% of the underlying price move. The deeper ITM contracts will be closer to 70% and the ones ATM will go up closer to 50%. (Hopefully im a bit off and they go up more…but I haven’t had a day yet where GOOG went up 10%, so im just making an educated guess based off what happens on smaller price moves). \n\nRight now, GOOG is up $281 per share pre-market (6:36am est). So I’d expect my contracts to go up about $196 on average. That translates to about $110k for my 6 contracts.\n\nI’ll give you one of my contracts as an example. \n\nIt’s a Jan 2024 GOOG call with a $3,100 stroke price. I bought it Jan 7 at $310 ($31,000 for the 100 share contract). Yesterday it had ZERO volume. (Which is kinda typical). It’s last actual trade was on 1/31/22 at $295.95. At close yesterday, the quote was $322.50 bid and $341.50 ask. My broker, pricing it at the bid, assigns a $32,250 value to my account, even though I probably could have sold it for a little\nabove that bid. (However - not always. In these illiquid leaps, if there is only one market maker, and they want to sit on the bid/ask….you sometimes do have to cave and sell for the bid. So you don’t get super efficient pricing.)\n\nAnyways, on yesterday’s market move of $43.60, that LEAP went from a trade of $295.95 to a bid/ask of $322/$341. So it went up at least $26 on a $43 market move. Which is 60% and where I’m getting my 50-70% estimate for today’s moves. \n\nThis all ignores changes in pricing due to changes in underlying volatility, and that can happen after key earnings reports and guidance changes…but that won’t dramatically affect leaps due to their long term nature. \n\nHope that helps, it’s the best quick and dirty I can do while sipping my first coffee.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I applaud your effort!!  \n\nI play weeklies now and then short term…but ~75% is in 2024 leaps.

{"title": "\"F\" - Ford $50 Price Target!!!! , TSLA - $500 Price Target!!!!", "selftext": "**Product Line**\n\nTesla have limited product line when it comes to EV’s, their most popular one model 3 and Y whereas Ford has better product line both in Consumer and Commercial including MachE, F-150 lighting and commercial EV vehicles. Ford is racing ahead in the commercial EV line and already has contracts with Walmart and others. Ford has the capability to deliver the commercial vehicles in 2022 -23 to businesses. \n\n**Margins**\n\nTesla’s biggest strength is their margins -Gross margin – 30%, Net Margin- 15% - 17% .Ford has lower margins (Gross – 15%, Net -8%) because they have lived in the old ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) world of lower margins However that’s changing and will change the path of Ford history of margins. The new blood in Ford has learned to focus and reduce the margins from Tesla itself and they are working to reduce cost and increase margins. Most likely they will take margins to next level in 2-3 years. \n\n**Valuation & Market Share** \n\nThe most controversial point that has jaded the most of us. Tesla has 900 billion valuation vs Ford’s barely $79 billion valuation. Given that Tesla’s revenue of 2021 - $53 Billion vs Fords $136 billion revenue. Ford being veteran and a value stock with dividends has been given lowest multiples of PE , Price to share for years because people never  thought that they would change or start a new product line, That’s changing now!! \n\nTesla has 70% market share in EV market and Ford with 5% but that’s about to change drastically. In a matter of couple of years Tesla will loose their ground in EV landscape and Ford will increase its market share to over 15% with their aggressive line of EV’s \n\n·**Moat**\n\nTesla had the moat with its manufacturing batteries, EV’s and automation. With time and effort that’s diluting and other auto manufactures have been able to manage to produce EV’s and batteries and eventually they will reach to automation as well. Ford is in the best position to beat Tesla in terms of higher quality EV, batteries and automation. \n\n**Marketing**\n\nTesla resonates with urban people and millennials which is good but Ford being 100-year-old firm comes with huge brand name and solid loyal customers. Fords new line of EV marketing and advertising has already done excellent job and proof is that they have over 270,000 orders within an year!!\n\n **High Interest rate Environment** \n\nWe are moving in high interest rate environment with global rate increases. Tesla is still labeled as growth stock in portfolio baskets and Ford has value stock label for decades. Ford has been rewarding shareholders with dividends. This high interest rate environment is better for Ford and Tesla will see winter. \n\n·**Team**\n\nLast but not the least. Obviously, Tesla has proven for years being a solid team of technologist and path breakers under musk leadership. Ford’s new CEO Jim Farley is best CEO ford has got in over several decades. Jim has clarity of vision and can execute that vision with smart and effective decisions. Within period of an year or so, he has taken steps to transform Ford to be a New age Auto manufacturer", "id": "slndrm", "created_utc": 1644113717.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 144, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|27|**First Seen In WSB**|10 months ago\n**Total Comments**|50|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/slndrm/f_ford_50_price_target_tsla_500_price_target/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlql2u/buy_aapl_by_eod_11042021_to_receive_the_dividend/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pub4pk/asan_super_short_candidate_with_handsome_puts/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqq3cw/cp3_ai/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlqnv2/buy_aapl_by_eod_11042021_to_get_the_dividend/) [x](https://i.redd.it/v45nbyd7oji71.jpg) [x](https://i.redd.it/n08nace2pji71.jpg) [x](https://i.redd.it/ojci00jmoji71.jpg) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pf479l/told_you_so_hood_will_fall/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pf49n0/told_you_so_hood_will_fall/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mu5fgk/prqr_has_over_300_upside_go_long_prqr/) \n**Account Age**|11 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=slndrm)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=slndrm)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I believe your name says it all friendo..", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You missed an extra 0 on TSLA...

Y'all gonna preach that inflation is super fucking high and money is devaluing quick af and also say it's fucking unsustainable that market is up 120% in the last 2 years or so.  \n\n**If it's the currency losing value quick, isn't it unsurprising that the market is going to perform good?** I mean, it's an alternative value holder to currency.\n\nLet me show you a smooth brained example. **Say you are a farmer like 1000 years ago, and you buy a cow for 10 gold coins.** Now, let's say your retarded kingdom faces an inflation so high it causes the price of the cow to go up 1 gold coin each year. Now, after 10 years, your cow is worth 20 gold coins! Did you make money? Fuck no, it's just that gold coins lost value and cows did not.\n\n**You wouldn't fucking talk about \"the imminent crash of cow prices\" if everything went up in price just because the cows did too.**\n\nAnd for those of you who think inflation isn't real? **Two years ago, I bought a cheeseburger at McDonald's for 1€, now it's worth like 1,40€.** I would also buy a protein shake at my local gym for 1€, now it costs 1,40€. The kebab place I frequented would cost 2€ per kebab, now it's like 2,90€ or some shit. \n\n*If you look past the March 2020 dip, we are only up some 42% at the SPY ATH. Going back to the previous cheeseburger / protein shake / kebab example, those prices are also up some 40%.* This is irrefutable proof that it's not actually market going up, but currency going down and market adjusting. \n\nSo saying \"this growth is unsustainable\" and \"we are in for a correction\" is fucking retarded if you think stocks only go up (which they do) since in theory, stocks have gone up 0% in the past 2 years (going back the the previous cheeseburger example). **Unless the prices of cheeseburgers also correct down, I don't see market correcting itself by a huge margin. If you think stocks only go up, that is.** Which you do. \n\n**This is obviously not financial or investment advice.** If you didn't gather it from the cow example, I'm fucking retarded.

And you can hold onto that piece while BRK is worth $300 a share, or $400 a share, or whatever it ends up being. Even if they don’t pay a dividend, if they do well, if they get bigger and more successful, then people will pay more for the company. Someone may not have enough money to buy all of Berkshire outright—they’ll just be looking to buy a bunch of shares. And you can sell when that happens. It’s not a scam, or a pyramid scheme, because those lemons, that lemonade, has value. If Berkshire said tomorrow they are now selling magic beans instead of investing in good businesses, then people would be like “eh no,” they’d sell and the price would crater. What keeps the price rising is performance and earnings. \n\nOf course the market can get out of hand and hype may raise a price beyond its actual value….

It just so happens that investors (usually) increase demand for a stock when the company does well. {BUT WHY, IF THAT COMPANY WILL NEVER PAY A DIVIDEND??, is my question}. \n\nTo provide a simple example:\nCoca-Cola releases it’s financial reports etc. for the year. They performed a 25% increase in profit and now has more capital owned. But a major external event occurs, like a world war. Owners of the Coca Cola stock rush to sell their stocks. The stock price goes down, despite the company being richer. \nDo you understand this?", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Stock is ownership of a company.\n\nA company has value, does it not?\n\nAdd up their materials, their patents, their stock of product, their quarterly earnings, their cash flows. All this gives a company real $$$ value. The lemons, the cups, the juicers, the real estate, the cash customers pay for a refreshing cup of lemonade... there is a dollar value attached to every aspect of my lemonade company. People from Wall Street gurus to individuals with a Robinhood account can do this analysis for themselves, and come to a dollar figure they believe my lemonade company is worth, based on value of the known variables alone.\n\nStock is a way to divide ownership of a company. \n\nIf I'm a sole owner, I have 100% of the stock. I can take a paycheck from my business (dividend) or I can take all my profits and buy more lemons, open more stands (growth). If I want to sell the entire business after I expanded from 1 stand to 500, I can do that, and garner what a buyer is willing to pay.\n\nHowever, if I want to keep control but need more capital to expand, if I want to take some cash out to invest in other businesses or pay for your mother's tit job, I may decide to sell only *some* of my ownership. I do this by selling stock. And just like it would be if I sold the entire business, it will be sold at a price buyer and seller agree upon (which, at a starting point, will be the value of my company now, plus a premium based on projections for the future).\n\nThose interested in owning part of my company should have a pretty decent idea how much that stock is worth because they've done the math. Why would they buy if they're not going to get a paycheck from the earnings? Because they want to do what I did. I took one lemonade stand, turned it into 500, and sold a part of my ownership for a huge profit. They want to buy into a company with 500 stands, watch the company grow to 1000, 10,000 stands, and sell at some point in the future for a profit. Large investors may even get some measure of control over the company's destiny by controlling board seats or commanding voting power at shareholder meetings.\n\nCan prices get out of whack with the intrinsic value? Of course! There's a lot of wiggle room when it comes to forecasting the future part of a valuation. Remember, any buyer isn't only interested in how valuable the company is now, they're also interested in how valuable it could be in the future. A world war, to use your drastic example, would certainly create headwinds for the lemonade industry (lemon shortages, perhaps?) and cause people to see less potential in my company--hence a drop, even if my earnings was spectacular last quarter (stock prices are forward looking). On the flip side, forecasts could be sunny: no war, lemons are hot on tiktok. Whatever the book value of my business now, investors are calculating their return based on what they expect the value to be in the future. \n\nThat value can of course get completely absurd based on speculation and there are countless examples of that, but that's exactly when a smart investor either sells or refuses to buy. Will a lemonade stand business really ever make enough money to justify a $100 Billion valuation? No? Then sell that or don't buy it.\n\nBut to call Berkshire a scam really is embarrassing for a number of reasons. It shows everyone here that you have no idea even how to do the basic math of valuing a business, which is pretty fundamental to anyone who truly wants to understand the stock market. If you did the math, you'd likely realize that Berkshire's stock valuation is actually quite low compared to what you'd expect it to be, given conventional means of company valuation. By some measures, the sum of Berkshire's parts is actually worth more than its stock price *right now*, which could make it a good buy... if you think they'll continue to get bigger and more valuable in the future. A \"cheap\" valuation for a solid company is usually--but not always--a good investment. (My guess is that some hesitation about Berkshire's post-Buffett future is baked into the low valuation at the moment.)\n\nHopefully some of this is sinking in. Stocks have value because companies have value. The value of a company goes up, the price will go up. The value goes down it will go down. Outside factors can throw the stock prices off-- that's usually a time to buy or sell or hold on for dear life until things settle. None of this means stocks that don't pay dividends are scams-- dividend stocks can display the same irrational behavior.

Practically though the future isn't perfectly knowable but people try to make predictions on the cash flows. Some predictions are more probable and plausible than others. For example, it is reasonable to expect that a company like Coca-Cola will continue to make similar amounts of cash as they did in the past given their relatively long history of business performance in doing so (from selling more volume of soft drink and raising prices). It is less reasonable to expect that a company with barely any assets, lots of debt and no history of positive earnings to be able to produce cash in the future (it may in the future but the probabilities based purely on the information given don't look too good).\n\nIf however things do go perfectly with the valuation, the business would earn the exact cash flows made in the valuation and the value of the business would increase at the discount rate (as would the share price). However as the future is unknowable people can have different estimates of the cash flows and there can be disagreements on what the discount rate should be. As such valuations can span a very large range. \n\nHowever, as investors are probably mostly humans they may and generally do suffer from biases and irrationality and these will factor in their valuations. As such many valuations can be extremely optimistic or extremely pessimistic. There is a range of valuations however which are reasonable based on available information. In the short run the competing valuations can send the share price to fluctuate, sometimes wildly. Not to mention the distortions added by other market players such as technical analysts, market manipulators, large institutions buying and selling, speculators, people wanting to sell stock to use the money elsewhere, etc. Over the long term though, the stock price does trend towards the range of reasonable valuations. Sometimes this can take years.\n\nShares are fractional ownership interests in a business and as such a shareholder is entitled to the earnings, cash and assets of the business. If shareholders wanted to access these they could band together and force management to pay a dividend, or sell the assets. Generally though they don't exercise their ownership rights since 1. the shareholders would need a combined majority stake in the business 2. organising and convincing enough shareholders to join in can be a lot of effort 3. shareholders may believe that management will be able to re-invest successfully to produce more cash in the future and hence increase they company's value 4. shareholder's simply can't be bothered to exercise their rights among other reasons.\n\nWhen Berkshire reinvests their profits in places where more even more cash can be produced the company directly becomes more valuable. The share price may not immediately reflect this because the majority of investors being human (mostly) can take a while to process this fact as well as there being distortions caused by non-fundamental analysts.\n\nThe goal of Berkshire is to increase the value of the business on a per share basis. They do this by investing in profitable ventures such as companies which generally have stable earnings, are able to earn high returns on invested capital and are selling at a discount to what they believe is a reasonable valuation (this is to safeguard against possible errors in calculation and adverse events that may occur which can reduce the value of their investment). As Buffett has demonstrably shown over decades that he is capable and successful of achieving this goal, by being not giving out dividends, he will have a massive cash pile ready to be deployed should outstanding investment opportunities arise, increasing the value of the business and hence over time, increasing the share price.\n\nAn investment operation is one which promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting this requirement are considered speculative. Berkshire assuming it's not selling at an expensive valuation, promises safety of principal due to the stability of the underlying businesses, and promises an adequate return from the underlying companies growing their profits and from stock prices reaching their underlying value (as Berkshire buys when the stocks are on discount).\n\nHopefully this helps.\n\nDisclosure: I own shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class B stock.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I guess you know nothing about investing or you haven’t managed a single business in your life.\nI would suggest reading some books about value investing.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Sounds like you don't know the answer to his question since you didn't answer it.

It climbed to 97 before quickly tumbling into the 60s.

{"title": "Rocket is gonna crash", "selftext": "Rocket ($RKT) reports Q4 earnings Thursday, 2/24 after market close.\n\nThey are the largest mortgage originator in the country. And they are about to have a really bad year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI expect earnings to miss. And Q1 guidance will be horrible. \n\n# Looking back at Q3\n\nFrom their press release:\n\n* 88.0B closed loan origination volume\n* 3.05% gain-on-sale margin (GOSM)\n* 49.6B retail with GOSM 4.47%\n* 37.7B partner with GOSM 0.78%\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Q4 2021 guidance\n\n* Closed loan volume of between $75 billion and $80 billion.\n* Gain on sale margins of 2.65% to 2.95%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo they guided lower volume and lower margins. The lower volume is not surprising due to seasonal trends (I think every single lender projected lower Q4 volume).\n\nBut the lower margins are interesting. This is probably due to increasing competition for less volume, combined with increasing wholesale market share (with lower margins).\n\n# Mortgage servicing rights (MSR)\n\n* Unpaid principal balance at the end of Q3: $521 billion. These are becoming much more valuable with higher rates.\n* They haven’t been growing it as fast and aggressively as some competitors, but still it is an impressive amount. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Q1 guidance\n\nHere’s where it gets interesting. \n\nVolume is quite low across the industry. Refinances are down over 50% (see below).\n\nSo how much will this plummet in refi volume affect Rocket? They don’t release their purchase numbers, but let’s try to predict:\n\nUWMC estimates Rocket has 88% refi (source: UWMC November investor presentation available at [https://s26.q4cdn.com/976831745/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q3/UWM-Holdings-Corp-3Q21-Earnings-Presentation\\_Final.pdf](https://s26.q4cdn.com/976831745/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/UWM-Holdings-Corp-3Q21-Earnings-Presentation_Final.pdf) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRocket had only 27% purchase in 2019, well before the huge refinance boom, as disclosed on their S1.\n\n [https://www.housingwire.com/articles/rocket-delivers-record-volume-in-q3-but-execs-are-tight-lipped-on-purchase-v-refi/](https://www.housingwire.com/articles/rocket-delivers-record-volume-in-q3-but-execs-are-tight-lipped-on-purchase-v-refi/) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn their Q3 earnings release, Rocket proclaimed “Q3 2021 represented Rocket Mortgage's strongest purchase closed loan volume in company history. Our purchase volume grew 70% over Q3 2020 levels.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTotal volume from Q3 2020 and Q3 2021 were nearly identical. Yet purchase volume increased 70%. \n\nTo give Rocket the benefit of the doubt, let’s assume they had 12% purchase in Q3 2020, before the 70% growth they cite, and a full year before UWMC estimated Rocket with 12% purchase mix. \n\n* Q3 2020: 89B\n* 53.5B retail\n* 29.6B partner\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If 12%/88% ratio:**\n\n* 10.7B purchase in Q3 2020\n* Add 70% and you get 18.2B purchase in Q3 2021, now 21% purchase\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**If 15%/85% ratio:**\n\n* 13.35B purchase in Q3 2020\n* Add 70% and you get 22.7B purchase for Q3 2021, now 26% purchase\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Another issue for rocket in Q1: Rate lock problems\n\nMortgage rates are rising exponentially. A rate lock in January may be significantly lower rate than the rate at origination a few weeks later. Longer times to close could have a big impact in Q1. It’s likely we won’t see any effects of this until Q1 earnings though. \n\n# Other data to support this\n\nloanDepot ($LDI) projected Q1 volume to drop by 8%-30%, and a huge drop in gain-on-sale margins:\n\n[https://s27.q4cdn.com/834830848/files/doc\\_downloads/2022/01/LDI-Q421-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf](https://s27.q4cdn.com/834830848/files/doc_downloads/2022/01/LDI-Q421-Earnings-Call-Transcript.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow let’s look at the publicly available mortgage data (h/t u/lymondfc).\n\n**VA data:** [https://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/Lender\\_Statistics.asp](https://www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/Lender_Statistics.asp)   \n\nALL\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $103,822,920,824\n* 4th Qtr: $92,468,433,277 (10.9% decrease)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRocket\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $7,319,511,113\n* 4th Qtr: $6,214,143,673 **(15.1% decrease)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**FHA Data:** [https://www.hud.gov/program\\_offices/housing/rmra/oe/rpts/sfsnap/sfsnap](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/rmra/oe/rpts/sfsnap/sfsnap) \n\nALL\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $85,650,768,830\n* 4th Qtr: $75,879,038,007 **(**12.9% decrease)\n\nRocket\n\nTotal Loan Amount\n\n* 3rd Qtr: $6,479,459,993\n*  4th Qtr: $5,461,202,656 (**18.5% decrease)**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVolume down 15.1% and 18.5% in both data points. Let’s take the average, down 16.8%.\n\nThat makes $72B volume, clearly missing guidance. \n\nYet **even if we assume high end of guidance, $80B Q4 volume, it's still a mess:**\n\n* 21% purchase: $16.8B\n* 79% refi: $63.2B\n\nUp to:\n\n* 25% purchase: $20B\n* 75% refi: $60B\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne month ago, when rates were even lower, MBA estimated a 50% drop in refinance volume from a year ago. Surely it's higher than 50% now. Mortgage rates have risen dramatically since then.\n\nSources: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/21/mortgage-refinance-millions-of-borrowers-just-missed-their-chance-to-save-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/21/mortgage-refinance-millions-of-borrowers-just-missed-their-chance-to-save-.html) \n\n[http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/di4t1gi881j81.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=7885082cd5d9a69beb8254881c604b2699085d4b\n\n# Putting it all together with only a 50% drop in refinance volume\n\n**Q1: $48-$50B total origination volume**\n\nThat’s a 33%-38% drop from Q4 projected volume. \n\n**Q1 2022 volume likely will be Rocket’s worst origination volume since they did $40.1B in Q3 2019, down over 50% from $103B in Q1 2021.**\n\nEven if they hit their high end of guidance for Q4.\n\nEVEN WITH VERY CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES of refi volume drop. \n\nThis is lower than pre-pandemic levels:\n\nQ4 2019: $50.8B\n\nQ1 2020: $51.7B\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMargins are dropping too.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n$RKT will miss earnings and issue horrible Q1 guidance due to plummeting refinance volumes.\n\nRocket will have a rough year.\n\n# Positions\n\n$RKT 50 9/16 12p", "id": "sx84h3", "created_utc": 1645382631.0, "score": 134, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 141, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|13|**First Seen In WSB**|10 months ago\n**Total Comments**|336|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q4zsek/uwmc_is_now_way_undervalued/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx9car/uwmc_interesting_developments/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q5a5f5/uwmc_ready_for_liftoff/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qx9kgp/uwmc_ready_to_pop/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/sx84h3/rocket_is_gonna_crash/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obcr17/uwmc_is_waaaay_undervalued/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r0qk1s/uwmc_dropping_hints/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwdhqt/uwmc_dd_insider_purchase/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/obe3bz/uwmc_is_waaaay_undervalued/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=sx84h3)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=sx84h3)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I sold my entire rocket position a while back when I placed an offer on a house and the seller declined because the lender was rocket mortgage.", "score": 73, "replies": []}, {"body": "Long term bag hloder checking in.\n\nPain.

{"title": "Backtesting the most popular investment strategies over the last two decades!", "selftext": "I have a confession to make. Even after all the [analyses and strategies I have created](https://www.reddit.com/user/nobjos/?sort=top), I allocate most of my investments to the S&P500 while keeping some part of it for the moonshots. I have told the exact same thing to everyone who has asked me personally for investment advice.\n\nBut as explained in this [fantastic article](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/the-problem-with-most-financial-advice/) by Nick, the problem with most financial advice is that it’s biased heavily towards your experience. I started investing in 2017 and have experienced nothing but a bull market (albeit the brief Covid-19 dip). But consider the situation of someone who started investing in 2000 or in the peak of the 2007 bubble. In both cases, it would have taken more than 6-7 years just to break even on their investments. I can’t even imagine waiting more than half a decade just for my investment to grow to its initial value, given the current market conditions.\n\nGiven that there is no one size fits all approach in the stock market, in this week’s analysis, I am doing a deep-dive into the various types of investment strategies, the returns generated, and their limitations.\n\nI should warn you now that this is not about finding the strategy that gives you the most returns. This is more so about finding what type of investment strategy fits you the best. While putting all your portfolio into crypt\\* might end up giving you a 10,000% return (which is fully viable for a 20-something-year-old with a small portfolio), having an 80% drawdown is not something a 50-year-old with a retirement account would be looking forward to.\n\nThe point I am trying to make here is that investing isn’t an absolute game, it’s a relative game. What fits you perfectly might be terrible for others. Your risk tolerance might be way higher. So I am offering you a choice:\n\n[All I’m offering is the truth. Nothing more.](https://preview.redd.it/djttp8bdzdj81.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=72279b8af4bf16dcdacff63120f80f5d514aa008)\n\n>*You take the blue pill, the story ends, you can close the page now and believe that DCAing into S&P 500 is your best bet. You take the red pill, you stay in wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.*\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9vxcbcg5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ff1c8397b104cdf30d5042a4ec90adbe5038f39\n\nLet’s start with the various types of investing strategies that are out there. Granted, this is not a conclusive list of the various types of investments, but I have tried to cover the popular strategies that are out there.\n\nBefore we jump into the results, now would be the right time to explain some concepts relating to how to analyze your investments objectively.\n\na. **Cumulative Return:** It’s the total return you would have made on your invested amount. Let’s say you invested $100 and over the next two years the investment went up to $200. Then the cumulative return is 100%.\n\nb. **Rate of Return (aka annualized return):** It’s the measure of how much your investment has grown or shrunk in an annualized format. This allows us to compare investments that are active across different time periods.\n\nb. [**Sharpe Ratio**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/sharpe_ratio.asp)**:** Sharpe ratio measures your investment return while making an adjustment for risk. For example, two investors A & B generate a return of 15% and 12% respectively. However, if A took much larger risks when compared to B, it may be that B has a better **risk-adjusted return**. All else equal, the higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better is your investment.\n\nc. **Max Drawdown:** This is the maximum observed loss from a peak to a subsequent bottom of the portfolio. It is an indicator of the downside risk over a specified time period. A 30% max drawdown implies that your portfolio was down 30% from its all-time high at some point during your investment period.\n\n**A quick note on how the investments are made:** I am considering an equal amount invested monthly into every strategy (Since this is the most realistic way of investing for a large majority of investors and lump-sum investing returns are heavily influenced by the starting point) \\[1\\].\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/87uprhj5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=99c2a247bb54400f0234217d968190395d666a92\n\n**SPY and Chill**\n\nI feel that this is one of the most common types of investment out there with a person investing an equal amount into SPY every month and holding on for a long time. The basic principle behind this strategy is that the stock market as a whole will keep rising over the long period as the national economy grows. Wealth creation would be possible by just tagging along with the index rather than trying to pick and choose winners within the stock market.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kkv55rsgzdj81.png?width=1233&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d896896d6e1ec867c40f2510eee145c537de63e\n\nAs expected, just investing in SPY gave an excellent annual return of 12.3% over the last two decades. On the flip side, since your portfolio is consisting of 100% equity, you would have experienced a max drawdown of \\~40% at one point (Around the 2008 crash). The fluctuations in the portfolio value are also captured by the low Sharpe Ratio of 0.62 which showcases that you are not adequately compensated for the risk that you are taking by holding 100% equity.\n\nIn most statistical tests, it is usually required to set a base rate - To see what is the “average” rate of success. The SPY’s rate of returns and risk is usually set as the benchmark because it accounts for the bulk of “safe returns”. Any returns outside this are usually accounted to an edge, the “alpha”, and finding that edge is what beating the market is all about. \\[2\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/g5j37cg5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=a596a3ea3c417089e2585df91847c50d02cb6475\n\n**Balanced Portfolio**\n\n[50&#37; Stocks. 50&#37; Bonds. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.](https://preview.redd.it/pmq1ss4izdj81.png?width=557&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff54e80e963ba1e2a63741d08a6a8acbfbf9ccfa)\n\nThis is the type of investment strategy where you are taking a balanced approach to investment. Having a 50:50 split on stocks and bonds would definitely impact your overall returns, but you can sleep better knowing that even in the case of downturns, your portfolio is well protected.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0n2fxe1jzdj81.png?width=1327&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f2857fa8e49866b95a1ffb166f2896fa05c76c7\n\nWhile the balanced portfolio did end up giving lower returns, it’s much better in terms of the max drawdown. Your portfolio would only have had a max drop of 14% when compared to the 40% drop experienced by SPY. Adding to this, the portfolio has an excellent Sharpe Ratio of 1.35 when compared to just 0.69 of SPY during the same period.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i9uzbavjzdj81.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c5fb0c713992ab8f1c69c4d81419b697b4270e8\n\nWhat’s even more interesting is that the portfolio ends up performing better than SPY during crashes\\[3\\]. As you can see from the backtest, during the financial and Covid’19 stock market crashes, your portfolio would have done much better than the market. The 2.5% CAGR \\[4\\] you are sacrificing by not going 100% in SPY is rewarded in terms of a better portfolio during the tough times.\n\n>*Harry Markowitz, the father of Modern Portfolio Theory, himself preferred the balanced strategy though his models indicated a more nuanced split. His reasoning was that it allowed him to sleep better at night.*\n\n[Link to the balanced portfolio backtest](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/Vhhi0M0jPwArFBskS258/details) \\[5\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xvnj7xg5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c4f59cf4b939ae34c0a85e8fce4c710c13bec87\n\n**Diversified Portfolio**\n\nIn this type of investment, we are looking to get a piece of all types of companies. I have considered **an equal split (33.33%)** between Large-cap, Mid-cap, and Small-cap funds.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9mubz0elzdj81.png?width=1327&format=png&auto=webp&s=40e85cda2a6d4ad2adde1a4ee1a9b221b6498570\n\nThe proposed type of diversification lessens the portfolio risk (as can be seen from max drawdown) but at the same time ends up giving a slightly lower return than purely holding the S&P 500. If you consider the Sharpe Ratio, SPY performs slightly better as you would have had similar fluctuations holding a diversified portfolio while generating slightly lower returns.\n\nI expected that the addition of Small and Mid-Cap should have generated better returns than SPY, but my hypothesis here is that the heavy concentration of tech stocks in SPY (\\~25% now) pushed the rate of return higher than that of the diversified portfolio containing small and mid-cap stocks given the recent performance of tech stocks. This brings us to the:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tech Enthusiast**\n\nAnother one of the common strategies that has paid out handsomely over the past few decades. In this, we are allocating 100% of our monthly investments towards Nasdaq-100 (QQQ). \\[6\\]\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mcddi21nzdj81.png?width=1336&format=png&auto=webp&s=f601e9070104eb263d15dbaa59e53105f9dffcf5\n\nWell, would you look at that! Over the last 2 decades, **QQQ has returned more than double the investment return of the S&P 500**. This can be attributed predominantly to two reasons.\n\n1. Tech stocks had an amazing run due to the advances in tech as well as the availability of cheap capital after the 2007 crisis.\n2. Our starting point (2002) is heavily biased towards QQQ. It’s the lull after the 2000 dot com bubble. If we had started the same analysis in say 1990, we would have had a very different result (QQQ dropped 78% from its peak compared to only a 46% drop in SPY during the same period).\n\nHaving 100% of your investment in one sector that performed phenomenally is bound to give stunning portfolio returns. Hindsight 20/20!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ogngegh5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=369f61976e26408e095ff061031bae173dd4a4ff\n\n**Growth Seeker**\n\nHere we are only focused on growth. Our investments are towards companies that are fast-growing. Since we are taking a higher risk on these growth stocks, we expect a higher portfolio return over the long run which is exactly what happened over the last 2 decades.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/scesx2yozdj81.png?width=1332&format=png&auto=webp&s=7acd9d8aa45191844fc7d5cf7a84dedd9c603cae\n\nBut once again this can be closely associated with investing in QQQ. I had considered Vanguard Growth ETF as my growth fund and as of today, their top 5 holdings are Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Tesla. **We are in a very rare time period where the largest companies in the world are considered to be the ones that are growing above the market rate!** Adding to this, going 100% on a growth fund gave us better risk-adjusted returns than just investing in the S&P 500.\n\n**Buying the Dip**\n\nThe idea here is simple. In this type of investing, you would not invest in the stock market and keep accumulating your cash position waiting for a crash. While this is a risky strategy, the returns do justify that investing during a crash tends to give you the best return.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7rr21twpzdj81.png?width=861&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a75fd510135fe3ed1882c452e3a532814723953\n\nI had already done an extensive analysis on Buying the dip that highlights the limitations as well as the nuances around buying the dip that is a must-read in case you are trying to replicate this strategy.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/21cqpyh5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bd2120aa029a185c1054bcb904ffb0b9b18cf69\n\nPhew! That was a lot to digest for sure. As I said in the beginning, this was not about finding an investment strategy that generates the most amount of returns. This was more about finding a strategy that fits you.\n\nMaybe you are still in the SPY and Chill bucket and want the simplicity associated with your portfolio. Or maybe you were swayed by the excellent drawdown protection of the balanced portfolio or the eye-popping returns generated by tech enthusiasts. Finally, you might want to dip your toes in the crypt\\* market after seeing the 10,000%+ returns if you have an above-average tolerance for risk.\n\nWe have barely scratched the surface here and there are many more strategies out there that we haven’t covered that might be perfect for you. The idea here is that there are much better strategies (both in terms of risk-adjusted returns and max volatility) than just investing in the S&P 500. It’s up to you to find one that fits you the best!\n\nIn the immortal words of Morpheus,\n\nhttps://i.redd.it/8pwiqj600ej81.gif\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lhcg9bj5zdj81.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c395d2c3d3c5ae3e0577f40ebad10214eee2841\n\nData used in the analysis: [**Here**](https://rows.com/market-sentiment/my-spreadsheets/untitled-spreadsheet-3-6FxZVmEYa4DNdVYzn4LTZx/live)\n\nLumpsum investment backtests : ([SPY](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/OV3ohHkJ4tKA6HqqSfle/details), [Balanced](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/Vhhi0M0jPwArFBskS258/details), [Diversified](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/aXiDzYzGFlraxOVfSXtL/details), [Tech](https://app.composer.trade/symphony/BOH7t4anTqXMBc2iA78F/details))\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n**\\[1\\]** For example, in case you are considering lump-sum investing, placing the starting point in the dot-com bubble (2000) would give vastly different results than if you consider your starting point as 2002.

Effectively this mean each time you get stop out, the trailing stop loss % increases by a certain amount. And adaptive trailing stop loss so to speak. These give better result than statically defined trailing stop loss %. But the hyper parameters are really unstable, so end result could change dramatically if parameters change very little.

In 2022, they have a chance to come close to that production growth again(possibly exceed). Their revenue growth should be even higher (higher ASP due to more expensive environment + more S/X sold this year).\n\nThey tripled earnings last year and should double them this year (last year they tripled because their 2020 earnings were very low, this year they will double because their 2022 earnings will be high, if that makes sense).\n\nTesla has a chance to become the most profitable US headquartered automaker in 2022. \n\nSo looking at their P/E ratio, they are at currently at 151.5 trailing 12 month P/E. However trailing twelve month isn’t a great metric for someone growing so quickly. In 2022 they produced 180k cars in Q1 and 305k cars in Q4. Growth that rapid isn’t accurately modeled with TTM metrics because we are already so far ahead of where we were 12 months ago. \n\nSo instead using the forward P/E and estimating earnings of $11B in 2022 we have a P/E ratio of 75.8.  Looking forward to 2023 we should have pretty extreme growth due to the ramp up of new factories. That 2 year forward PE becomes something like 34x (probably lower) in my modeling. \n\nAs we are anticipating continuing enormous growth, that number is ridiculously low. Look at other tech company PE ratios and then look at their growth rates. You’ll see there is no comparison.\n\nKeep in mind Tesla is making cars which cost 50x an iPhone with almost iPhone margins, in a market that is not saturated but only a couple of years old.\n\nAlso look into PEG ratio.
