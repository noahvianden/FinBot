(I myself am guilty for mentioning some of these) For a new trader putting your money into something like SUNE is like throwing darts at a dart board blind-folded. \n\nHigh risk securities are for experienced investors, not a good idea for a new trader. If you just want to get your dick wet without going balls deep, here is a list of several non-retarded stocks that are beginner friendly: \n\n1. O (income reality corporation). You see that 20 year chart? linear growth with a massive dividend. \n\n2. JNJ (Johnson and Johnson) When everyone else was melting down during the recession these guys didn't miss a beat. \n\n3. MCD (Mcdonalds) look at that fucking chart. Returned 35,000% since inception need I say more? \n\n4. BRK-A (Berkshire Hathaway) \n\n5. GIS (General Mills)\n\n6. MKC (McCormick)\n\n**How to yolo on reasonable investments**\n\nIf you are a new trader trading with like 5k you should be generating your risk with margin. For example you if you buy 5k worth of JNJ, you can double it with margin to 10k. Now when the stock moves 1% you earn 2% instead. \n\n**This is a public service announcement for beginners.**\n", "id": "49t6ir", "created_utc": 1457611895.0, "score": 51, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 56, "comments": [{"body": "BRK.A seems shifty to me.
