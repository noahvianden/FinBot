{"title": "[DD] For those who were smart enough to hold on to your $ARO...", "selftext": "Some points to consider if anyone is thinking about cutting losses tomorrow:\n\n1. Some of the AH tanking was stupid people with stupid stop losses/circuit breakers.\n\n2. This shit happens all the time and recovery is not impossible, [$PIR for example](https://i.imgur.com/77jhyH8.png).\n\n3. Unlikely to go bankrupt, [the debt](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/aro/financials?query=balance-sheet) is hardly anything for this to become an issue. More likely to be bought over.\n\n4. As stated in their press release, the dispute with MGF slowed down supply which inevitably affected sales. They've got Stifel (firm) in to try and sort some of this mess out and this might mean a buyout could be an option.\n\n5. Worried they might be delisted? Reverse split plzthx.\n\n6. They've extended their licensing agreement with Liverpool ([mid-to-high end retailer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_%28store%29))  in Mexico until 2023. \n>Liverpool will open up to an additional 150 locations under this license extension.  A\u00e9ropostale currently has 322 international locations, including 227 locations in Mexico through its partnership with Liverpool.\n\n7. Expanding in [India](http://www.fibre2fashion.com/news/fashion-news/a-ropostale-opens-first-store-in-india-175794-newsdetails.htm) and [Indonesia](http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=131103&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2064438) since 2015. \n> India is expected to become the world\u2019s youngest emerging economy by 2020, with around 64 per cent of its population in the working age group. Having understood this, we are glad to add power players like A\u00e9ropostale as additions to our already fast growing fashion portfolio.\n\n8. High open interest and okish volume for Jan 2017 calls. Hoping we won't have to wait that long but a bit of reassurance I guess.\n\n9.
