I've convinced myself to take a large (for me) position in long term calls (Sep or Dec).\n\nOne other thing I thought about before pressing \"save comment\".  Total flyer, but what about news articles about the soon-to-be-released 1080 being sold out.  I have no idea if that is possible, what their current inventory is of the Founder's cards.  It may not be an earnings announcement event, but it could be a small-ish bump up.  So, I've now convinced myself to bet on June's OTM $50 calls as well.\n\nThanks for asking the question.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "thanks for such a good answer. honestly odds are if your on wsb and a nerd you know a bit about nvidia. it is hard to put fanboism aside. ill play devils advocate a bit.\n\nthe thing that has me so hesitant is the pullback in the beginning of the year. sure it was due to the spx dipping a ridiculous amount... but still it dipped all the way down to mid 20s. there was obvious upside there. here i dont think the upside is as obvious. i think macro wise the spx is all up too much and due for a pullback. with nvda rsi being so high and pumping these all time highs it might drop back down to the high 30s. above 37 i would think as that was a pretty established bump. maybe 39-40\n\nit is at the top of the bollinger bands for a very long time... also the rsi is high 14 day is 82. MACD off the charts bullish its insane.\n\nnewswise i know they got the 1080 and it sold out, but they did a limited run of these founders edition at first. they will keep selling more throughout, but the first chance to buy the gpu (with other sellers having to wait a period) is now going to have a higher margin for them. they essentially cut out the middle man and manufacture themselves (aka outsouce wherever... taiwan??) hopefully they have a good company building them with no counterfitting issues or delays in shipping.\n\nit might not be the best performing version, but its the first to ship and has nvidas tech all built in.\n\ni think long term you are safe. i like sep and dec calls, tho i would rather own shares at this point for the dividend and choice to sell some covered calls on the shares.  weeklies so i could just rebuy shares if mine get called and collect premiums. i see their grown as consistent and alot of the big factors will be based on ER of related parties and their own.\n\nwhat i dont see is this going up all week and blowing past 45, and approaching 50 within the month. its just too bullish i think. maybe all the shares that got traded when monthlys expired friday will increase the trade volume on monday. lets see if spx is up or down.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Your post got me a little hesitant about dipping into the NVDA well again.  Thank you for that.  I may turn out to be wrong, and I don't blame anyone but myself, but I generally take the bullish case in every scenario.  Turns out great when things turn out bullish.  Not so much when...  So, thank you for the reasoned response.  It may have prevented a complete meltdown of my cash account.\n\nBut, I personally think the retracement that everyone is expecting to happen, already happened on on 5/23 and that the 10-15% continuation trend is happening now.\n\nIn any case, I did buy 100 July and June $50 calls on Monday.  No Sep or Dec.  Those are too fucking expensive for my trading account.  Tuesday turned out well, but I have no idea what happens going forward.\n\nMy bullish case for this is that NVDA continues to trade sideways or up until there is a continuation gap when people like yourself and other traders finally give in to the idea that NVDA will continue going higher without them and start buying.  I think this is helped by the rolling bull market going into chipmakers as evidenced by yesterdays action.\n\nI expect to see an exhaustion gap when the general public start panic buying thinking this stock is a sure thing.  I hope to sell at that point.\n\nSo far, I think the stage is pretty well set for this scenario.  7 of 8 green days since earnings.  Everyone, at least on WSB, chomping at the bit for a pullback.\n\nMy thinking for the case of the continuation of this trend is that I really expected a drop in short interest after earnings.  I may be reading it wrong, but short interest going from 62.3m before earnings to only 61.7m short after earnings could be a good case for going long.\n\nI expect that the number of shorts covering will continue to make this stock go higher.  I think the doji showing yesterday was a good thing for longs.  I think it got a lot of technical traders to short the stock or buy puts, which makes longs cheap and increases the chances of a real short squeeze.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, open interest on puts in the options market through the end of June is between 2 or 3 to 1 puts vs calls, depending on the expiration date.  It is not comforting knowing that you are bucking the odds 2 or 3 to 1.  \n\nThe only comfort I get from it is that when you get to the July expiration, puts vs calls are almost even.  The way I read that is that a lot of people are betting it falls in the short term but more are betting it rises 2 months out.\n\nAny devil's advocate thoughts you have would be welcome.
