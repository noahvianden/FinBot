The revenues and user growth looked impressive, and the foreign currency is a drag.\n\nGuiding down in 1Q is fine by me. I'm glad the market felt the same way.\n\nHere are the catalysts and things I'm focused on moving forward. Wondering if you feel the same way:\n\n* TicketMonster sale. Have to nail this.\n* Their doubling down strategy on Goods. Mehhh. I'm not too encouraged about this because it's so low-margin and a couple of quarters ago they had too much inventory and mismanaged Goods. However, when you look at the multiples e-commerce sites have gotten in the past, it's possible it pays off in the long run. However, most of those sites were gobbled up by eBay and its ilk, so is the end goal to have AMZN or EBAY buy them out? That's a longer-range thought, though.\n* Re: Goods: I wonder how much of their stuff is sitting off of the coast of Long Beach. Could drag down 1Q numbers.\n* On a more positive note, I liked their plans to use beacon technology. I think that's the future and shows promise. I hope they've been working on this for a while though as it seems slightly late\n* If that seems slightly late, their pay system/tech seems VERY late. I wasn't too encouraged by this as Apple Pay, Square/eBay and $PAY/Verifone are dominating the space. What's the point in a proprietary system? I suppose I understand the customer issue of awkward redemptions. This, in theory, should help. But wouldn't partnering with someone produce more revenue? At pennies a transaction, you now expand your highest margin part of your business on the backs of one of the biggest global payment systems. \n\nOverall, I think it's still in a tenuous position to make it long-term. However, they're in good shape atm and I think [shorts](http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3062-nasdaqshort-highlites.html) will begin to cover as all of these analyst upgrades are popping out.

I played ITM 7.00 calls across different exp. dates--some out to July.

The revenues and user growth looked impressive, and the foreign currency is a drag.\n\nGuiding down in 1Q is fine by me. I'm glad the market felt the same way.\n\nHere are the catalysts and things I'm focused on moving forward. Wondering if you feel the same way:\n\n* TicketMonster sale. Have to nail this.\n* Their doubling down strategy on Goods. Mehhh. I'm not too encouraged about this because it's so low-margin and a couple of quarters ago they had too much inventory and mismanaged Goods. However, when you look at the multiples e-commerce sites have gotten in the past, it's possible it pays off in the long run. However, most of those sites were gobbled up by eBay and its ilk, so is the end goal to have AMZN or EBAY buy them out? That's a longer-range thought, though.\n* Re: Goods: I wonder how much of their stuff is sitting off of the coast of Long Beach. Could drag down 1Q numbers.\n* On a more positive note, I liked their plans to use beacon technology. I think that's the future and shows promise. I hope they've been working on this for a while though as it seems slightly late\n* If that seems slightly late, their pay system/tech seems VERY late. I wasn't too encouraged by this as Apple Pay, Square/eBay and $PAY/Verifone are dominating the space. What's the point in a proprietary system? I suppose I understand the customer issue of awkward redemptions. This, in theory, should help. But wouldn't partnering with someone produce more revenue? At pennies a transaction, you now expand your highest margin part of your business on the backs of one of the biggest global payment systems. \n\nOverall, I think it's still in a tenuous position to make it long-term. However, they're in good shape atm and I think [shorts](http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3062-nasdaqshort-highlites.html) will begin to cover as all of these analyst upgrades are popping out. Last time it popping on an ER, it seemed to move up for 6-7 trading sessions. I'm hoping we get to $9 and then I'll exit completely; sold some this morning.\n\n\n\n", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3645545542240143}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37114521861076355}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4383334219455719}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.36708128452301025}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3492625057697296}, {"body": "HON MMM NYCB LOCO RYI, RYI just bottomed.
