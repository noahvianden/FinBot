{"title": "The Ultimate Stock Trader's Toolkit (Part II in Comments)", "selftext": "**PART I:**\n\nHey y'all!\n\nMost of you guys know me but if not my name is Chris aka @ckz8780 on Twitter and I'm a full time trader and run Greenbar Trading, my company, which is focused on stock market education. In the past I've posted my stock picks here in /r/stockmarket and lots of people have made money off them and I've always gotten tons of great feedback so I wanted to do something to give back to the Reddit community for being so welcoming and letting me blabber about my picks, myself and my services on here so I could grow both my trading and my business. Without Reddit I wouldn't be where I am. Now, I constantly get PMs and questions about what tools I use and the truth is there are literally hundreds of tools that you can use but having a good solid list of websites and tools is essential to doing accurate market research, picking the right stocks and then actually being able to trade them. So I am going to go through my list of hundreds of bookmarks and tools that I have here on this computer and share all the best ones I know and what I use them for. I won't add to this list unless it is a tool I use regularly because I only want to recommend stuff I have used personally and found to be successful, but definitely feel free to post your own favorites in the replies to make this list even bigger. I'm going to personally stay away from all the standard stuff like The Intelligent Investor, Investopedia, etc. Those are great but this is stuff I actually use practically every single day. If you want to learn how to trade from scratch then send me a PM and I can point you in the right direction. Ok, in no particular order of preference, here we go!\n\n**TRADING SOFTWARE/BROKERS:**\n\n* [Suretrader](http://www.suretrader.com): My main broker. Great shorts and no pattern day trading rule.\n* [Tradestation](http://www.tradestation.com): Another broker I use heavily. Amazing software but retail so you have to maintain $25k to day trade. One of the most powerful scanners in the business using EasyLanguage.\n* [Thinkorswim](http://www.thinkorswim.com): TD Ameritrade's \"Professional\" software. It's a bit buggy and slow and they sell your order flow so executions suck for day trading, but the charting is pretty nice and they have a decent scanner. Also it's one of the only platforms I really like for paper trading, though Tradestation is also really nice for that.\n* [Scottrade Elite](http://www.scottrade.com): Scottrade's \"professional\" software. Not bad if you're doing more advanced swing trading. Fills and executions are surprisingly good for a retail broker. Also they will bundle TradeIdeas (an awesome intraday scanner) for like $10/month.\n* [FreeStockCharts](http://www.freestockcharts.com): The best free charting software out there. If you are not advanced enough to be using the trading software above but the charts on Google Finance and Yahoo Finance aren't good enough for you, this is your answer.\n* [TradingView](http://www.tradingview.com): Another good (and free!) chart site if you don't have pro trading software.\n\n**SCANNERS/SCREENERS:**\n\n* [StockFetcher](http://www.stockfetcher.com): The best bang for the buck hands down when it comes to scanning. Very powerful and easy to code. I use it literally every single day and it's cheaper than Netflix!\n* [Finviz Screener](http://www.finviz.com/screener.ashx): Great for screening stocks with all kinds of characteristics from descriptive to fundamental to technical. Screens can be saved \n* [StockMarketWatch Screener](http://thestockmarketwatch.com/markets/pre-market/today.aspx): Nice scan I run each morning to find the stocks that are gapping up/down the most. These will be the ones in play for that day. Combining this with Finviz I can throw all the gappers into Finviz and check the news on them quickly and easily.\n* [Google Finance Screener](https://www.google.com/finance/stockscreener): Similar to Finviz's screener but allows you to screen on some different stuff like [float](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/04/091004.asp) which Finviz doesn't allow. \n* [StockCharts Predefined Scans](http://stockcharts.com/def/servlet/SC.scan): Great list of predefined scans for generating trading ideas. \n\n**USEFUL WEBSITES:**\n\n* [StreetInsider Earnings Insider](http://www.streetinsider.com/portal/Earnings+Insider/5.html): Great for quickly determining if a company met, beat or missed earnings, what their consensus was, and what their guidance was. Also provides next expected EPS date.\n* [Zacks Earnings](http://www.zacks.com): Just type the ticker into the quote box in the upper right and look under the \"key earnings data\" section to find the next earnings date. I've found Zacks' dates to be the most accurate over many years of trading.\n* [ETF Replay](http://www.etfreplay.com/summary/1.aspx): Great summary of ETF performance for gauging sector performance and finding strength when all seems weak, weakness when all seems strong. \n* [Finviz ETF Maps](http://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=etf): Same as above.\n* [Bespoke ETF Cheat Sheets](http://www.bespokeinvest.com/thinkbig/2012/7/30/bespokes-full-line-of-etf-cheat-sheets.html): Looking for an ETF that relates to what you're trading? Check out these cheat sheets for ideas.\n* [Yahoo Finance Sector List](http://biz.yahoo.com/p/s_peeu.html): List of all **sectors** for generating ideas on what to trade.\n* [Yahoo Finance Industry Browser](http://biz.yahoo.com/p/sum_conameu.html): List of all **industries** for generating ideas on what to trade\n* [Yahoo Finance InPlay](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/inplay-briefing-com-055139997.html): I check this often in the morning to quickly scan news headlines that will move stocks.\n* [Is The Stock Market Open?](http://www.isthemarketopen.com/): Well, is it? \n* [Chartgame!](http://www.chartgame.com/): Time lapse trading game. Great for practicing your identification of technical analysis patterns for swing trading without having to wait for months to collect a good amount of data from your trades.\n* [The Ultimate Swing Trading Guide](http://www.swing-trade-stocks.com/): Great beginners' guide for learning to swing trade. Read this from beginning to end, in order. It can be done in a weekend. \n* [Hoovers IPO Central](http://www.hoovers.com/ipo-central/100004160-1.html): Everything you could ever want to know about IPOs. \n* [ShortSqueeze](http://www.shortsqueeze.com): Great for quickly checking how much of a company is currently held short...can help identify short squeezes that really rip.\n* [Tradervue](http://www.tradervue.com): Great trade tracking and statistics website for tracking your performance. It's free for up to 100 trades per month. Useful if you're trying to develop a trading system and need data on what works/what doesn't. \n* [My Trades](http://www.tradervue.com/shared/users/1460): Over 2,200 of my shared trades with notes on why I took them, where I bought/sold, where my stop was, etc. I update this occasionally but usually do it in blocks every few months now. \n* [Finviz Economic Calendar](http://www.finviz.com/calendar.ashx): Good for being prepared for upcoming economic news like GDP data, FOMC minutes, etc. \n\n**CRUCIAL READING/BLOGS/ETC**:\n\n* [Forensic Investing Red Flags](http://www.bus.lsu.edu/accounting/faculty/napostolou/forensic.html): Good resource for finding holes in a company's fundamentals and red flags in financial statements/reporting.\n* [Best time of day for trading](http://www.tradingmarkets.com/recent/learn_the_best_times_of_the_day_for_the_best_trades-2-677749.html): Cool article on the best time of day to place certain trades and how the market reacts to changes in time. \n* [The Trillionaire Next Door](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0066620767/daytradersbullet): Hilarious book about day trading. Should be on every full time trader's desk to keep the stress of trading at bay.\n* [The Logical Trader](http://www.amazon.com/Logical-Trader-Mark-B-Fisher/dp/0471215511/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1330402471&sr=8-1): Great book about Mark Fisher's trading style and how he keeps trading simple. Simple is good. \n* [Trading From Your Gut](http://www.amazon.com/Trading-Your-Gut-Instinct-Smarts/dp/0137047681): Awesome book about properly using your right brain/left brain to trade more accurately and more confidently.\n* [Anything by Brett Steenbarger](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_0_10?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=brett%20steenbarger&sprefix=brett+stee%2Cstripbooks%2C232): Great author of many trading books. I found Daily Trading Coach and Enhancing Trader Performance to be really useful and practical. \n* [Anything by Mark Douglas](http://www.amazon.com/Mark-Douglas/e/B001IGOXOE/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_5?qid=1414900959&sr=1-5): Another great author that provides practical stuff you can actually use rather than just useless theory. I like Trading in the Zone and The Disciplined Trader the best. \n* [Anything by Marcel Link](http://www.amazon.com/Marcel-Link/e/B001IGJO7K/ref=ntt_aut_sim_3_2): Great author of books designed to help you improve your performance through strategy development. \n* [Darvas Trader](http://www.darvastrader.com/): Great blog with tons of awesome articles. I read it regularly.\n* [Your Daily Watchlist](http://www.yourdailywatchlist.com/): Keith Kern's (@stt2318) website. He provides lots of nice charts both on Twitter and on this site. Many are free. Good for generating ideas. \n* [The Trader's Podcast](http://traderspodcast.com/): Amazing podcast with tons of short 10-30 minute episodes on everything you could ever imagine about trading.\n* [Greenbar Trading Blog](http://www.greenbartrading.com/blog): My blog. I haven't updated it in a while but there are a lot of good articles in the archive about things I've learned and my journey to becoming a pro trader. \n* [OpenTrader Blog](http://blog.opentrader.com/): Awesome blog with lots of eye-opening articles on all things related to trading. \n* [Alpha Wolf Capital](http://vegastrader66.blogspot.com/): Great blog by a great full time trader named Tim Weintraut out of Vegas. I traded with him for a week recently and was blown away by his knowledge. He has been trading for over 20 years and is a great guy. I contacted him via Twitter out of nowhere and he had never even met me and allowed me to come stay in his house and trade with him for a week and hang w/ his family! \n* [Trade on the Fly](http://www.tradeonthefly.com/): Another great trader I met recently and traded with for a week in Montana. Michele is a swing trader and posts tons of great charts. She moderates the swing trading room in Nate Michaud's (@investorslive) chat room. \n* [Bulls on Wall Street](http://bullsonwallstreet.com/blog/): Nice blog run by a good buddy of mine, Kunal Desai. He is kinda a wacko but he's a pretty good trader and his blog has lots of free info and education on it. Really funny guy too!\n* [10 Traits of Successful Traders](http://bullsonwallstreet.com/10-traits-successful-students-turned-traders/): Good article on what it takes to become a full time trader. Kunal pumps a lot of his students in this article including me and for him it's more of a marketing tool to sell his bootcamp but I still think it's great for people to read to see what it takes and learn some of the characteristics of the traders he's worked with who really took off and became extremely profitable.\n\n**SEE COMMENTS FOR PART II**", "id": "2l1hrl", "created_utc": 1414903482.0, "score": 205, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 59, "comments": [{"body": "This is great. Forgive my ignorance but, I'm on the fence about funding my SureTrader account. Been watching too much American Greed.\n\nI'm trying to plan out a schedule where I withdraw once a month for bills and such. Have you actively withdrawn funds without delay?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I'm not going to recommend Suretrader one way or the other because I haven't used it long enough but I can tell you that when I set up my account it was approved in less than 24 hours and when I wired funds in they cleared the next day. I can also tell you that you should expect delays when wiring out. Any time you wire money to/from what's considered by the financial industry to be a \"slow pay country\" it can take up to three weeks legally. That goes for all kinds of wires, not just for trading purposes. I would just plan ahead for potential delays. The reason Suretrader seems to have such shitty reviews in terms of people getting their money out is that people in the developed world expect their money in 2 days and that's not how slow pay countries like the Bahamas work so people are shocked because they weren't expecting it. Anyway I don't want to make a recommendation one way or the other but I can tell you I know many people I trust who use Suretrader and so far I've had no problems and their customer service has been good. Time will tell!\n\nEdit: oh BTW just a heads up it is free to wire money in but there is a $100 wire out fee so plan for that in your monthly expenses. This is the same with most overseas brokers and prop firms and is a cost you pay for the privilege of not needing to have $25k to day trade and having great short lists and lots of leverage with relatively low commissions. Speaking of commissions, they are negotiable if you are an active trader. ", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Hey, thanks for the reply. Can you please check your DM's?

Meh, this is Reddit; what can you do?", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "Lol yes there is a lot of bullshit out there. I've done this long enough that I like to think I have filtered through a lot of it, but you learn new things all the time. The thing w/ Nate and the SEC is the one argument everyone uses to bash Investors Underground and it's legitimate but at the same time I have seen first hand his chat room, traded with his moderators side by side (in person) and seen their skills and techniques, as well as seen several people I knew before they joined IU and they went from being mediocre/shitty traders to making 10x as much as me in a very short period of time. Some of these people have sketchy backgrounds and some run businesses that make way more for them than their trading activities, but the truth is they didn't get to that point by being shitty traders. You have to start somewhere. In my experience Nate is a great teacher and is very willing to help his students even though he charges for it; he will bend over backwards to help you and so will most of the people who moderate his chat and run his side businesses. Kunal is the same way. The guy invites his students all the time to come to his condo in Florida and trades hand in hand w/ them to help them grow and will do anything for you...if I don't talk to him for a while he calls me and bothers me and sends me texts until I call him and give him an update on how my trading has been and how I'm doing because he wants to make sure that his students and friends are successful just like him (even if they do it selling services, teaching, etc). Keith Kern also I have chatted w/ him on Twitter and he was very willing to meet up with me to share his ideas and style as I was driving around the country meeting different traders and was a super nice dude. Most of these guys even if they are charging or making more from their businesses than from trading are still really good teachers and willing to help a lot, and they're all consistently profitable traders in the long run. Further, I actually know a lot of people who are really shitty traders but are still awesome teachers and have a lot to offer so it's not always 100% based on \"how much money do they make in the market?\" Sometimes people are just better at teaching or have weird shady backgrounds or completely suck at trading but still have a lot to offer. I think you can actually learn just as much from someone who tried trading for a living and failed miserably as you can from someone who was successful. Anyway you're right, there are a lot of great resources here but it's important that people do their own DD and understand that I'm not recommending any of these services, just showing what I have used myself and what has worked for me to get me to the point that I could trade stocks for a living.

This industry needs more constructive criticism and definitely more skepticism. Let me clear a couple things up.\n\nFirst, I'm not recommending any broker or suggesting anyone give money to anybody. This is just a list of resources I use myself. Your decisions on who you give money to are your own. I have five brokers. Suretrader, Ameritrade, Scottrade, Tradestation and a small hedge fund account, not including two 401(k) accounts through Fidelity. I use them all and they all have strengths and weaknesses. For day trading, I use Suretrader and Tradestation the most but Suretrader I like better because they have a great short list and I don't have to have $25k tied up with Tradestation giving me $120k in buying power that I don't really use. That's just inefficient use of my capital. Anyway I understand that Suretrader is a bit shady being overseas but I have, so far, has nothing but good experiences with them. I was very skeptical at first too but so far so good.\n\nSecond, regarding the Twitter recommendations, again I did not recommend giving money to any of these guys/girls. I just recommended following them because they all provide something useful or at the very least post good blog posts and show through their trading/pumping what this industry is really like beneath the surface. I have personally met and traded with many of the people I've listed and seen them trade with my own two eyes and yes they are all good traders. Some are better than others. Some people are purely pumpers BUT that does not change the fact that it's useful to follow them because they have influence on the market. In terms of people I trust I would put Derrick, Emil and Brandon on top of the list as I have seen them all go from losing or breaking even to making huge consistent profits over the last couple years. I talk to Emil literally every day. Also Michele (@offshorehunters) I literally stayed in her guest bedroom for a week, traded with her and got to know her and her husband and her family and traded with her side by side. Same with Tim (@vegastrader66) and his family. I was at Kunal's condo in Florida so long his mom made me start cleaning it! Lol anyway the point is I'm not recommending any of these peoples' services or anything like that, just saying they all provide a little something useful that might improve your trading :-)\n\nThe truth is this is the stock market. Mostly everyone has ulterior motives so you have to take everything with a grain of salt and do your own DD. This is just what has come out of mine. \n\nHope this helps clarify my intentions and some of these concerns you had.", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09333957731723785}, {"body": "Edit: Oh hey BTW I was actually curious about the regulations for overseas brokers like Suretrader also so in my research on them I found that they are in fact regulated. Suretrader has liability insurance through AIG's international arm and is regulated by the Securities Commission of the Bahamas, though I don't know if that really provides any comfort since who knows what their rules and laws say.

I just ask that you include a little about yourself so I know what your current experience level is and what your goals are as a trader. Then we can chat about how to meet them! Hopefully this post helps people. I make no claims to any stocks or trading ideas w/ this, just wanted to post a huge list of all the things I use regularly that help me as a day/swing trader.

The SEC does not set rules for pattern day trading. FINRA does. FINRA sent the rules to the SEC where they approved them and now they apply to all **US brokers**. Non-US brokers may or may not be affected and it depends on the country the broker exists and conducts business in. Finally it's not the SEC that places a freeze on your account if you do not meet the PDT requirement and continue to day trade; it's the broker itself.\n\nAnyway thanks for your comments.
