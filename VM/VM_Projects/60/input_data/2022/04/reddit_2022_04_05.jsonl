{"title": "Fed’s Brainard sees balance sheet reduction soon and ‘at a rapid pace’", "selftext": "> Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who normally favors loose policy and low rates, said Tuesday that the central bank needs to act quickly and aggressively to drive down inflation.\n\n> In a speech for a Minneapolis Fed discussion, Brainard said that policy tightening will include a speedy reduction in the balance sheet and a steady pace of interest rate increases. Her comments indicated that rate moves could be higher than the traditional 0.25 percentage point moves.\n\n> “Currently, inflation is much too high and is subject to upside risks,” she said in prepared remarks. “The Committee is prepared to take stronger action if indicators of inflation and inflation expectations indicate that such action is warranted.”\n\n> The Fed already has approved one interest rate increase: a 0.25% hike at the March meeting that was the first in more than three years and likely one of many this year.\n\n> In addition, markets expect the Fed to lay out a plan at its May meeting for running down some of the nearly $9 trillion in assets, primarily Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities, on its balance sheet. According to Brainard’s Tuesday comments, that process will be swift.\n\n> “The Committee will continue tightening monetary policy methodically through a series of interest rate increases and by starting to reduce the balance sheet at a rapid pace as soon as our May meeting,” she said. “Given that the recovery has been considerably stronger and faster than in the previous cycle, I expect the balance sheet to shrink considerably more rapidly than in the previous recovery, with significantly larger caps and a much shorter period to phase in the maximum caps compared with 2017–19.”\n\n> Back then, the Fed allowed $50 billion in proceeds to roll off each month from maturing bonds and reinvested the rest. Market expectations are that the pace could double this time around.\n\n> The moves are in response to inflation running at its fastest pace in 40 years, well above the Fed’s 2% target. Market expectations are for rate increases at each of the remaining six meetings this year, possibly totaling 2.5 percentage points.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/05/feds-brainard-sees-balance-sheet-reduction-soon-and-at-a-rapid-pace.html", "id": "twye3y", "created_utc": 1649174734.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 60, "comments": [{"body": "> the pace could double \n\nSo rolling $100 billion off per month?

Until recently most investors were anticipating that the FED would rather allow inflation run hot than risk sending the economy into recession. But this reads surprisingly hawkish to me and I've been surprised several times in recent weeks with how aggressive they seem to be getting in their language.\n\nIf this hawkish shift persists then investors are going to find it increasingly hard to own stocks in an environment where the FED is signalling they're willing to do whatever it takes to bring inflation under control, including risking a recession. In my opinion the risk the FED might now decide to tighten until something breaks is fairly high. My guess is that the FED is beginning to understand that they're behind the curve and in the coming weeks will try to get ahead of market expectations in an attempt to regain their creditability. If this happens there is no way the market can sustain multiples this high.\n\nYou're right that if this on its own shouldn't concern the market that much, but the trend and the fact that this is coming from Brainard is worth paying attention to.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "It's not hawkish unless you are ignorant of how bad inflation is going to be later this year. \n\nDespite rates rising 100bp since March 1st, inflation breakevens have risen by the same amount, meaning real rates are roughly the same as they were before Russia invaded.\n\nThis is the Burns Fed all over again. They raised rates gradually assuming that would tighten financial conditions and slow the economy. What they didn't get was that inflation rose faster than rates, leading to a boom and eventual bust.", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Or its a good signal in that they see inflation as the greatest threat to an otherwise healthy economy.  I take some of these comments as positives.  We have to do it anyway.  But they are signaling that sooner is fine and will not shock the economy into recession.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "While I agree with you that interest rates need to go up as demand and employment are robust, it's silly to think that the cost of crude oil or grain is going to drop meaningfully because the FED is raising rates. For example if you look at CPI minus food and energy (ie, the stuff the FED can control), inflation looks far less worrying:\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CORESTICKM159SFRBATL\n\nClearly tightening is needed, but perhaps not as much. I suspect demand is going to weaken this year regardless of what the FED does simply because living costs are increasing and Europe is likely to enter recession which will have some impact on the US growth. This all needs to be factored in given rate hikes are basically just a tool to influence economic demand and the demand picture is deteriorating rapidly.\n\nMy hope is that the FED is just talking hawkish at the moment to keep inflation expectations low, because if they're about to get serious about fighting a supply-side inflation issue with rate hikes then they'll probably have to send the economy into recession. At the end of the day the only way demand is going to match the unhealthy levels of supply is by dropping demand to equally unhealthy levels.\n\nIf they're BSing and just trying to talk down inflation expectation then they're risking losing all creditability as at some point they need to pivot to avoid recession. They can't win, but imo relatively high inflation over the next year or two would be better than recession. They need to signal that while they understand the need to tighten near-term, they also cannot meaningfully control the high levels of inflation we're currently seeing because it's not primarily demand-driven.\n\nWhat I suspect will happen is that they'll tighten the economy into a recession and inflation will remain high because the FED obviously isn't going to fix a supply-chain issue and a war in Ukraine with rate hikes. If I'm right, we're probably heading for stagflation and that's not exactly a \"healthy economy\". The right thing to do would have been to raise rates months ago, or even better for the FED and government not to have been so fiscally reckless in their 2020 response to COVID, but it's too late for that now. Now you pick between recession and inflation and my guess given these comments is that the FED is now quite likely to pick both.", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I don't see how they have any credibility.

Then you have accomplished nothing.\n\nIt's just flimsy rationales at best. \n\nLike pumping the stock market during a pandemic. Why?  Those most vulnerable to the pandemic probably don't even own many stocks. I just don't understand it unless through a partisan political lens. \n\nThen it seems obvious. The Fed is ran by a bunch of wealthy people who are afraid of their trickle down fiscal policies being repealed. So they do what they can to not only get more trickle down (see 2016 rate increases) but maintain trickle down (see 2019-2020) policies. \n\nA rational fed would have said that Trump's tax cuts would mean significant rate increases do to the fact that eventually taxes will have to go up or services cut. Both of which would cause a potential recession.
