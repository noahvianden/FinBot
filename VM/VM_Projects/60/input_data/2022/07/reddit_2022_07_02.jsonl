{"title": "Our financial system has turned into a full blown opioid addict.", "selftext": "A brief history of how we got into the shit show dumbed down that even some of you might get it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary:\n\nThe current state of affairs in our financial markets is essentially the fed keeping a slow drip of morphine into the market and at any sign of that stopping there's a tantrum, so they keep doing it. Now the side effects are starting to show.\n\nThe backdrop:\n\nLet's go back to 2008 crisis (**The Accident)**. The FED lowered rates to 0 (**The first shot of morphine**) in order to stimulate the economy, but that wasn't enough so they came up with a concept we all know and love \"quantitative easing\" (**The long term morphine drip**). The fed spent trillions of dollars purchasing securities in order to drive down interest rates and stimulate borrowing in the hopes of restarting the economy. They were wildly successful at doing this, so much so that the markets got addicted to this (**Congrats, you're a crack head**).\n\nThe unintended side effects: With money being dirt cheap, companies decided they would issue tons of debt, while that is exactly what the fed was hoping, instead of the companies reinvesting that money, growing the work force etc. they instead bought back stocks. Now this makes perfect sense as that's the easiest way to grow your market cap, borrow some free money and just pump the shit out of yourself. Over 6 trillion dollars were spent on stock buy backs. What does this do for the overall health of the economy? Nothing. Stock prices soared, stonks only go up is born.\n\nThe tantrum:\n\nThe year is 2013, the FED is starting to realize that while they avoided an economic collapse, the unintended consequences of QE are starting to show, an everything bubble is forming and the economy is seemingly doing well, so its time to ween off the Fed's tit (**Attempt to get clean**). At this point the fed's balance sheet is at 3 trillion, they announce a tapering of QE to allow our favorite concept - capitalism to do it's thing. Well the markets hated that idea and immediately began a massive sell off. This of course made the fed worry that all the work they have put in reviving the economy might be for nothing, so they immediately back tracked their decision and promised the continuation of QE (**The Relapse**).\n\nThe sickness:\n\nThe markets came down with the sickness yet again with the pandemic. The fed yet again has to step in and act to save the economy which by this point is a full blown heroin addict. This time a slow morphine drip will not cut it, they need to keep it connected to a fire hose that is pumping 24/7 (**Money Printer go BRrrrr**). This yet again revived the economy, fed trillions of dollars into the markets, made all the billionaires billions of dollars and dropped unemployment, while vastly increasing the wealth gap yet again.\n\nThe side effects:\n\nWe have run out of veins to shoot up, the mere thought of QE stopping makes us squirm and have withdrawals before it even happened. Inflation sets in, we now have record inflation, buying power is being reduced, the money put into the economy that were meant to stimulate growth and wages just artificially ballooned the markets and asset prices skyrocketed, the average consumer however saw no significant benefit from the 12 years of QE, but will brunt the entire force of the side effects.\n\nToday:\n\nThe fed has announced a tapering of QE, which as we can see did not happen yet even though it was supposed to start in June, they are attempting to increase rates to fight inflation but the market is so jacked to the tits and propped up so high by the nonstop spoon feeding it's received for the past 14 years it literally doesn't know how to function otherwise. We are at a point where if the global economy does take a downturn there are no tools left to prop us up much longer, we have such a high tolerance to QE that it is going to take exponentially more every time there's a downturn. The FED have created a floor for stocks, every time there's a downturn they ride in on their white knight and rescue us, but those rescues are increasingly more expensive and constant, and at this point we are so addicted we cannot function without it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion: The FED must ween us off the QE, they have to increase rates and let capitalism work, because for the past 14 years we haven't been a free market, only degenerate risk taking because there has been no downside or consequence. Pumping more money will only increase the inflation hurting average people, while QE benefits the people that need it least.\n\nThank you for coming to my rant.", "id": "vpg0n4", "created_utc": 1656724347.0, "score": 165, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 69, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|26|**First Seen In WSB**|4 years ago\n**Total Comments**|143|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f9dyk2/fun_fact_about_tsla/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vpg0n4)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vpg0n4)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "As the saying goes: A junkie don't bounce until he hits the ground...", "score": 43, "replies": [{"body": "That cat's dead.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Think it's Schrodingers cat rn as it's both dead and alive", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Yep we’re both in a bear and bull cycle, fucked and not fucked", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Tbh i feel that's pretty accurate at the moment..", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Hahaha yea honestly.\n\nI feel the market could get so bad the fed will restart QE again, which will lead to what I was saying lol", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Schrodingers junkie.

It’s all boiling down to one thing, that’s human greed. Human basic desire for more money FAST!

So all of them work together to create this huge financial bubble with 0 rate, extremely aggressive QE and a monstrous fed balance sheet. \n\nWe are finally facing the pain of sniffing cocaine too much but this won’t end.
