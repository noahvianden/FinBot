{"title": "Why Gold is The Best Play | Hint: Not Because of A Recession", "selftext": "Russia recently moved to peg their currency, the Ruble, to Gold. The Ruble, which was crushed at the onset of initial US sanctions, has been on an absolute tear since they‚Äôve made this decision which appears to have caught the US completely off guard. \n\nSome background - the US has been so successful the past decade because they have had the luxury of being the World Reserve Currency as the USD. This means all oil trades in USD and we reap all of the benefits that go along with that. This is at risk now as countries like Russia and China have gained traction in economical influence. The impact of moving away from the USD as the World Reserve Currency would be absolutely catastrophic to the United States economy. The unfortunate part is that the current administration is unwilling to unlock our abundant supply of natural resources and has been sending away all of our free cash overseas which is diminishing our leverage with big oil players, in addition to other countries advancing their military technology significantly. \n\nRead this for some more info here: https://www.usgoldbureau.com/news/is-brics-a-threat-to-the-dollar\n\nInterestingly enough, the G7 is now looking to ban gold imports from Russia. Apparently this was to be officially announced, but I have yet to see the official announcement myself and I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs made its way into mainstream media for some reason.  \n\nRead here for some more info: https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/g7-announce-ban-import-new-russian-gold-tuesday-us-official-2022-06-26/\n\nLastly, Biden is visiting Saudi Arabia this weekend. The discussion points and reasons for the visit have been relatively quiet. In my opinion, the administration is very concerned they will be moving away from the USD as the petrocurrency as they are in active discussions with China to begin using the RMB. I think the whole trip is to try to stop Saudi Arabia from doing so and that all of this was Russia‚Äôs entire strategy for starting the Ukraine war. \n\nRead between the lines here: https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/14/politics/jamal-khashoggi-joe-biden/index.html\n\nTLDR; Russia checkmated US with gold backed Ruble.

Whereas something like farmland is a productive asset that produces 'stuff' every year and thus it's value is determined by the cashflow it produces.

In inflation, people can't buy jewellery or electronics etc rather need to meet base needs - eg energy requirements. Sure, gold may go up, but it's probably a pretty poor investment when there's a ton of better companies/businesses to buy out there in this environment. Also, highly liquid assets like gold are usually the first thing to be sold during a crash/recession not the other way round (as a lot of fraudulent market 'gurus' who shill gold without much thought would like you to believe).
