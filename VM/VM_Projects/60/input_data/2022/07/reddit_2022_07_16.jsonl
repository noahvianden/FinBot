Then bears will wait and believe GDP will be a decisive blow when it comes negative the next day after and shill FOMC as a massive bull trap but Biden and PPT buddies will tell Americans that a recession is bullish because a recession means lower inflation which means more rate cuts. Price in rate cuts and printer going brrrr. I think these will make market go up and then wait there is more, if we reach a depression it will be even more bullish because it means less inflation and even more cuts.
