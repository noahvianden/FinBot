{"title": "How the market works, this is not leaked classified info, and I am not a time traveler", "selftext": "People think the market will tank on FOMC but wait until a fake FOMC is released with 2 point hike instead of .75 point hike then on the actual day we get a 1.5 point which will be bullish because it isn’t a 2, Powell will also justify this by saying “oh we have no meeting for a month after so it’s really a 0.75 hike”Then on top of it Powell will say inflation is being fought so we will also price in a 2pt cut for 2023 pumping us. Then bears will wait and believe GDP will be a decisive blow when it comes negative the next day after and shill FOMC as a massive bull trap but Biden and PPT buddies will tell Americans that a recession is bullish because a recession means lower inflation which means more rate cuts. Price in rate cuts and printer going brrrr. I think these will make market go up and then wait there is more, if we reach a depression it will be even more bullish because it means less inflation and even more cuts. ARE WE PRICING IN AT 1% INFLATION YET WHEN WERE ACTUALLY AT 20%? YES! We will now price in negative rates by EOY and we will hit new ATH. Now I can’t trade off this information and I had to intentionally short the bearish news past couple weeks so I can lose 100% of my portfolio and not affect the timeline.
