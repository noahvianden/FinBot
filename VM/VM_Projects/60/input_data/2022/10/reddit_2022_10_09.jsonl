{"title": "In this market growth stocks are dead, cash flow is king. Here are a few names I may sell puts on", "selftext": "The bear market continues with one of the worst weeks to come out of the last couple years (yet again). However, the market saw a rebound and nearly 2% swing from the low on Wednesday after an options trader, or fund, placed a huge bet expecting SPX to rebound into the end of the year. Options sentiment may play a role in markets where big bets, usually smart money, expects a shift in the market direction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter all, SPY is down 25% YTD with the QQQ down nearly 35%. IMO it may be wise to start setting yourself up by DCA-ing into positions that are down big or by selling cash secured puts while this volatility offers a good premium. After a drop like we just saw I find most investors looking for the plays that will continue dropping that extra 5-10%, but in my opinion the greatest risk-reward will be setting up your portfolio for the long-term. Bear markets are an opportunity create wealth and I’ll be DCA-ing into my positions with cash-secured-puts in higher volatility names or through buying shares.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFYI images are taken from [Prospero](https://www.prospero.ai/), an options analytics and fundamentals app (it’s free).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Options Sentiment**\n\nAccenture (ACN) caught my attention on Friday where net options sentiment turned bullish going into the close. This large increase in activity may be someone setting up positions for the coming weeks. The big drop in net sentiment at the open led the way for shares to tumble further. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote, most of the market looked like this on Friday with many names tanking shortly after the open all the way into the close.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fq0mya3lirs91.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f74817ba44d38fc800ba3f1e979c6c1aa86bbbe\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I like about ACN is their profitability score, which is quite high. They generate roughly $62b in sales per year and income of $7b. ACN’s fundamentals are fairly strong with a P/E of 24x and price/sales of only 2.6x.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hnb9737pirs91.png?width=1244&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d5e73fb9e2a6d6c6e6080c337098ce2090a22d3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe potential of the credit bust is real and with that I am looking at names that are generating strong cash flow. The proof is in the pudding, you saw that most small-cap growth names are down 80% YTD while companies generating revenue saw a less severe decline. The market is punishing companies that did well back in 2020 and 2021 based on their growth estimates rather than profitability. Now, the turn-tables have turned and the only thing that matters are companies that are producing solid cash flows, aka CASH IS KING until further notice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Chipotle - CMG**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/whmy11k2jrs91.png?width=2378&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb9a47121953e5a96c605d472446fc950fd78c52\n\nAmazingly, Chipotle has been extremely resilient in this bear market and has outperformed SPY bigly (only down 10% YTD). CMG’s P/E remains elevated at 55x, but price/sales is only 5x.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wbwjsky3jrs91.png?width=1150&format=png&auto=webp&s=31ee7707415ba6245649c798c04a83d90c8a0689\n\nCMG generates $750m income on $8b sales and has been consistently growing revenue at 15% QoQ.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Adobe - ADBE**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0m4vjgq7jrs91.png?width=2378&format=png&auto=webp&s=8803e5cd612d6cc927459ae41ce06bcd00d24f83\n\nAdobe is trading back to 2019 levels and before they experienced growth during the Pandemic (thanks to more digital creators coming into the market). In fact, since 2019 they’ve increased revenue by nearly 50%. They are a cash flow machine producing $5b income on $17b TTM sales.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ngni7u96jrs91.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ca36ae5af6b828ebe9cfcfbc4868b2b1e880c19\n\nAfter this decline they are still trading at a P/E of 28x, which is not a bad time to take advantage of the secular tailwinds we are seeing in the content creation and digital media industries. They rank high on the profitability scale.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Ulta Beauty - ULTA**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/imx14hu9jrs91.png?width=2382&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ef0629b0ee7a34227779a4aa4d0404627ae4035\n\nEver heard of the lipstick effect? It’s defined as when consumers still spend money on small indulgences during recessions, economic downturns, or when they personally have little cash. This sounds like our current economic environment and possibly one of the factors ULTA is only down 6% YTD. Profitability metric and upside breakout are ranking high. They have:\n\n* TTM Sales: $9.5b\n* TTM Income: $1.1b\n* P/E: 18x\n* Sales Growth QoQ: 16%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0mj6rt4ajrs91.png?width=1174&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bdb0e00cc06ab8d6b9f2cbe0d22998b7bc5b97e\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Thoughts**  \n\n\nP/E ratios for most companies have fallen to pre-pandemic levels and it may be a good time to start looking to DCA into positions or sell cash-secured-puts for the a bit more security on the play.", "id": "xzj2v8", "created_utc": 1665313964.0, "score": 358, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 58, "comments": [{"body": "Even cash flow isn’t king some of the best REITs are getting destroyed only cash is king.", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "I like cash flow supported by cash position and good asset/liability ratios", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "fly pathetic lunchroom reach one plucky joke muddle coherent hungry\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yes.

They don't have a killer product that they can spend $X on and continue to reap profits beyond the initial investment.  They basically have some amount of profit on every hour of engineering time they can sell.  This limits their potential for growth dramatically(i.e. they'll never be Apple, Google, Facebook, etc).

But both of these strategies limit my earnings. At the moment, I am not sure if I wanna do it just make a couple thousand dollars.
