Mooney introduced H.R. 9157, the ‚ÄúGold Standard Restoration Act.‚Äù \n\nThe legislation calls for the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve to publicly disclose all gold holdings and gold transactions within 30 months, after which time the Federal Reserve note ‚Äúdollar‚Äù would be pegged to a fixed weight of gold at its then-market price. Federal Reserve notes would become fully redeemable for and exchangeable with gold at the new fixed price, with the U.S. Treasury and its gold reserves backstopping Federal Reserve Banks as guarantor.\n\n‚ÄúThe gold standard would protect against Washington‚Äôs irresponsible spending habits and the creation of money out of thin air,‚Äù said Congressman Alex X.
