So it's also possible they have already done enough to cause a recession some time next year. Falling stock prices, falling home building and real estate sales, and an inverted yield curve are all potential leading indicators for a recession.\n\nAnd there was no real surprise in this report either, it's in line with what the Fed's projections seemed to be at their September meeting, so they probably won't change course. Meaning they'll continue to hike short term rates  (the Fed Funds rate and interest on reserves) to ~ 4.5% next year before stopping. But the Fed is also not expecting a recession.
