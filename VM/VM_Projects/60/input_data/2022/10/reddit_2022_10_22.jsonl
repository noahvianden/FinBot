Some of this work has gone to the cloud which is why revenue has been declining but there are a plethora of applications that can't afford the latency penalty or can't host data on the cloud due to regulatory and security concerns. Furthermore DXC is very involved in migrating a customer's infrastructure to the cloud and upgrading a customer's Security and Networking which obiously has increased importance when the data is offsite. There are even some companies who decide to do private cloud. Essentially they own the infrastructure themselves and have DXC manage it. This in peticular is a big revenue opprotunity for DXC. All this doesn't even touch upon DXC's custom software buisness and data anyalitics buisness. It represents half of DXC's revenue and its growing. The data anaylitics buisness is a competitor to companies like $PLTR (albeit less impressive) and the custom software buisness is a competitor to $EPAM. An example of a custom software application is the infotainment screen in Volkswagen cars. I am prepared to hold this thing for 10 years but honestly if the stock never goes up and they keep buying back shares at this rate (they repurchased 4% of the float last quater) the're will be 30% less shares outstanding in 2 years if revenue starts to grow like I am expecting and the buisness keeps improving I the stock kinda has to go up. But when you consider that DXC's competitors TCS and ACN are $100 Billion+ companies and DXC is only worth $7 Billion that kinda gives you an idea of the opprotunity.
