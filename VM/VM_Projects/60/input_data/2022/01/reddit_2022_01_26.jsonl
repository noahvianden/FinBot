It also found that the majority of chip manufacturing facilities are operating at or above 90% capacity, and that the median demand for chips was as much as 17% higher in 2021 than in 2019. The available supply isn’t increasing enough to match demand.\n\n“With sky-rocketing demand and full utilization of existing manufacturing facilities, it’s clear the only solution to solve this crisis in the long-term is to rebuild our domestic manufacturing capabilities,” Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a news release.\n\nThe report found bottlenecks in specific semiconductor inputs and applications, including legacy logic chips used in products like cars and medical devices; analog chips used in power management, image sensors, and radio frequency; and optoelectronics chips for sensors and switches. The survey also found bottlenecks in wafer production, which lacks an apparent short-term solution.\n\nBarron’s highlighted the far-reaching implications of chip shortages in a May 2021 cover story, dubbing the phenomenon “The Everything Shortage.”\n\nRaimondo did point to some signs of improvement, including an announcement from Intel (ticker: INTC) that it planned to invest $20 billion to build a vast chip facility in Ohio, as well as a November announcement from Ford Motor (F) and General Motors (GM) concerning automotive semiconductor partnerships. \n\nStill, Raimondo noted that if a Covid-19 outbreak, a natural disaster, or political instability disrupted a key foreign chip facility for even a few weeks, it could shut down a manufacturing facility in the U.S. In addition, the Commerce Department is looking into reports of unusually high prices for chips sold through brokers.\n\n“Every day we wait is a day we fall further behind,” Raimondo wrote in a blog post summarizing the survey and urging lawmakers to pass the U.S. Innovation and Competition Act. A vrsion of the proposed law passed in the Senate last year and would include $52 billion in domestic semiconductor funding.", "id": "sct2cw", "created_utc": 1643158848.0, "score": 66, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 65, "comments": [{"body": "It will be 2040 and a PS5 will still be near impossible to buy", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "You sure you don’t want a PS4 /s", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Still rocking my now 8 year old PS4 I bought used.

With overall economic slack now absorbed, the Bank has removed its exceptional forward guidance on its policy interest rate. The Bank is continuing its reinvestment phase, keeping its overall holdings of Government of Canada bonds roughly constant.\n\nThe global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is strong but uneven. The US economy is growing robustly while growth in some other regions appears more moderate, especially in China due to current weakness in its property sector. Strong global demand for goods combined with supply bottlenecks that hinder production and transportation are pushing up inflation in most regions. As well, oil prices have rebounded to well above pre-pandemic levels following a decline at the onset of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. Financial conditions remain broadly accommodative but have tightened with growing expectations that monetary policy will normalize sooner than was anticipated, and with rising geopolitical tensions. Overall, the Bank projects global GDP growth to moderate from 6¾ % in 2021 to about 3½ % in 2022 and 2023.\n\nIn Canada, GDP growth in the second half of 2021 now looks to have been even stronger than expected. The economy entered 2022 with considerable momentum, and a broad set of measures are now indicating that economic slack is absorbed.
