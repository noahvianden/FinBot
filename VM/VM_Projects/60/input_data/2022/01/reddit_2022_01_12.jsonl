{"title": "Inflation 8:30AM ET - My forecast 6.7% to 7% with 6.9% as median. Market expects 7%.", "selftext": "Hello everyone again!\n\nI posted yesterday on JPow's confirmation hearing [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s1f9to/jerome\\_powell\\_confirmation\\_hearing\\_live\\_now/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s1f9to/jerome_powell_confirmation_hearing_live_now/)\n\nLast month I predicted inflation to be within 6.7 to 6.9% (actual 6.8%). [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rd8hu3/inflation\\_countdown\\_10\\_minutes\\_830\\_et\\_my\\_guess](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rd8hu3/inflation_countdown_10_minutes_830_et_my_guess)\n\nThis month, my analysis shows inflation should be within expectations or even better! My minimum prediction is 6.73% and maximum range is 6.97%. My median prediction is 6.86%. Analysts expect 7%, and last month was 6.8%.\n\nFirst **Food Away from Home** I used past BLS PDF releases: [https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm#2021](https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm#2021). First note the relative importance for CPI (ie % of basket is for food away from home).\n\nFirst COVID deaths in December are much lower than last December - last December / Jan / Feb was a horrible time. However with the advent of Omicron, people will buy more food online.\n\n[Google COVID deaths](https://preview.redd.it/oxw7eaye78b81.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&s=13ed9cd57bd28ae9d64a01423c0d5da259011dc1)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xdycj9ns78b81.png?width=1031&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2d4d3b3dbe114beba27d323786715d3402b2845\n\nYou can see above my relative importance for food away from home jumps this month from 6.262% to 6.304%. Total quits as per the great resignation / antiwork movements seem to possibly subside this month, since it's generally in a cycling motion - up n down. However with Omicron - it might be more problematic. However, last month you can see a rise in quits (GREEN), and in general food inflation (PURPLE) rises generally in tandem. I suspect November's sudden jump in quit ratio combined with restaurants hiring more to prepare for Omicron will cause food prices after adjusted for relative importance to go up to 0.439% YoY. Previously 0.363% YoY. YoY 6.9%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ike882j088b81.png?width=1151&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca5f90627919083e453aa1c3d3233089da31fa18\n\nOn  **Other Food prices,** I suspect it's very possible companies are purposely passing higher costs to consumers.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0vtwar9798b81.png?width=393&format=png&auto=webp&s=011ad0298e4754485be386e09ca30a6c2c2275f1\n\nIt's quote clear above producer prices for pork, poultry, beef seem to have somewhat recovered, except weirdly prices for the consumer are going up. I'm going to assume the trend continues at a 15% slope.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wgp5t8ed98b81.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=c368bfbd7aa497cbba31fafd237c3c4e89d2631a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wedv43b098b81.png?width=1027&format=png&auto=webp&s=418ef3e8989bfc316aee13ebd5d47c50817d9864\n\nYou can see I attributed food minus food away from home inflation after adjusted for relative importance to be around 0.55%. YoY 7.034%.\n\nNext is **Airline Fares.** Multiple sources showcase from 26 December to January 3ish, airlines had to cancel around 10 to 12% of all flights. In fact recently some airlines will permanently cancel 10% of flights due to staffing shortages due to Omicron.\n\n[FlightAware](https://preview.redd.it/b3gymbyt98b81.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=11f7416f433d7c07092c3f32959b62e4471a8abb)\n\nHowever, the number of people going to see family and friends seem to be very high - hence I attributed a jump in relative importance from 0.58 to 0.7. Prices seem to be increased by at least 10% due to cancellations (ie less supply, high demand == higher prices).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3fpra524a8b81.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e4a8826e6334df95df0675f5fdcc450084e5fe2\n\nI attribute after weighting for relative importance for airfares to contribute a whopping 0.7% increase - which is exceptionally large. YoY 10%.\n\nOnto **rent, shelter** \\- the largest chunk normally. Due to Omicron, vacancy rates have been going UP to 4.3% this month from 3.8% in August this year. Uncertainty from COVID caused people to move back to their loved ones to reduce cost, and take care of their family.\n\n[Apartment List](https://preview.redd.it/49xdibuba8b81.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec9f5c897ab4e7dcbb0623ba8d596d851cab2397)\n\nThis makes me reduce the relative importance by around 0.04% or so, not much from last month. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/encdmiyja8b81.png?width=1023&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3708aa01e890f534d74f9aff36ec38be7565774\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ftdhndjsa8b81.png?width=892&format=png&auto=webp&s=723f13531693336ef7ec5f5ca7e9e7b8998d652c\n\nAbove, I showcase the shelter costs in tandem with other graphs. Shelter costs seem to have subsided, however, when compared to December 2020 (which dropped from Nov 2020), presumably no YoY reduction is seen. I place the YoY to be similar to last month's 3.8% albeit higher at 3.85%.\n\nOn **used cars**, the Manheim index is useful. Above you can see car prices to go up still in December, albeit at a slower pace.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ych2bss9b8b81.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=88bea37dcb81281e99d4cd7619ade89ab019e8f1\n\nNew cars inflation tend to around 37% or so that of old cars. Likewise Manheim says sales seem to be slightly flat, and down YoY. Relative importance will be adjusted to reflect a 1% growth. After adjusting used cars to be 37% and adding new and old cars, we get a 7.262% inflation attribution. YoY old cars 34%. New cars 12.58%.\n\nOn **energy prices**.\n\n[EIA](https://preview.redd.it/0s5aq1mxb8b81.png?width=499&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad55c60c23a4189133211bf09fdf7b4d2599b398)\n\nFirst gas consumption is a proxy for general energy consumption. You can see the seasonality. In Dec 2021, we had somewhat of a cold winter, with some storms and issues. 2020 was unusually warm. 2019 winter. 2018 was blizzard time. So in general, I'm upping the relative importance like that in the blizzard times ie from 7.469 all the way to 7.7%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9670lsg8c8b81.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=caa8ab41401f6ecbec8b53cf756de318c43fce90\n\nOn actual prices, it's quiote clear gas prices have FINALLY dropped after a stubborn increase. Data is sourced from EIA's weekly gas prices. It's quite clear you can see the dip in December. If you layer CPI for energy, you can see a similar trend in general. I believe YoY energy to rise by 26.04%, a drop from last month's 33.51%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w1apyvccc8b81.png?width=1153&format=png&auto=webp&s=067757ee461311e63af4f429a36bb93dd657d40a\n\nOnto **medicine**. Due to rising COVID, we presume medicine costs to go up due to people buying testing. So relative importance is higher at 7.1 from 7.002. However, if you compare December 2020, COVID was running rampant in the US - deaths skyrocketed. Now, deaths are reduced.\n\n[Google covid deaths](https://preview.redd.it/9yeyesftc8b81.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f7335f3fdf0ac447ffdbf09b20f2ababf747bc9)\n\nBy just getting the 52% reduction in deaths compared to December 2020 levels, and multiplying out, we get YoY a 1.468% inflation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kt2himuxc8b81.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=af98edcc9eacf818623359fc8146fe9108dfb61e\n\nNow if you combine everything:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k70icx69d8b81.png?width=1018&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb94d6ee3ad40cbdd5aef93d3eb5fe50ae77acb3\n\nYou will see a relative importance attribution of 69.16% (ie I missed 31% or so of the basket). By looking at past ratios, approx at maximum 15.33% adjustment needs to be made. At best 11.38%.\n\nBy adjusting my final guess of 6.044% inflation by these adjustements, we get inflation for December to be at **minimum 6.733%, median 6.86% and at most 6.97%.**\n\n**This means in general, market analyst predictions of 7% seem reasonable, but it's very possible 6.9% or so can be seen - the issue is I'm missing 31% of the other basket.**", "id": "s22u3y", "created_utc": 1641981948.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 64, "comments": [{"body": "8.27% is my guess based on nothing", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Yikes thats a high one! :)", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Sure, that's alot of data, but Little Cesar's $5 pizzas went to $5.50.... %10 inflation", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "Yep the data approximately shows food inflation to go up from 5.8% to 6.9% year over year.

I see mispricing in valuation between now and the next 12 months.\n\n**VIR Biotechnology (ticker: VIR) -** developed 'Sotrovimab' COVID-19 treatment and partnered GlaxoSmithKline to manufacture it.\n\nSo many things happened within the last two months with **VIR** that didn't respond yet in its share price. And yesterday we've got major announcement at JP Morgan 2022 Healthcare Conference that triggers, confirms a bull thesis ([link](https://investors.vir.bio/static-files/7ecf45fb-6918-4cf8-9a02-b8c12183ca4f)).\n\nI predict that the company will have **at least $3.5 billion** in Sales of a **Sotrovimab**. And will have **$30/share** Cash on a Balance sheet. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Facts\n\nIn **Q3 2021** they sold just more than **50,000** doses of a drug at **\\~$2100** and received **\\~$102M** in revenue. They had contracts of **750,000** doses to deliver in 2022.\n\n**What has changed/What's the buying opportunity?**\n\n1. Omicron hit in December. Covid treatments from **$LLY** and **$REGN** became ineffective against Omicron, leaving the **only working** monoclonal treatment - **VIR's Sotrovimab**\n2. Just yesterday [they announced](https://investors.vir.bio/static-files/7ecf45fb-6918-4cf8-9a02-b8c12183ca4f) that they already sold **750,000 doses in 2021** and now have **1,700,000 doses** contract worldwide with most in Q1-Q2 of 2022. Their manufacturing capacity increased so they will produce **2,000,000+ doses just in 1H 2022**. That's a **2.26x** increase from the previously known data!\n3. Due to the **huge demand** and **shortage of Sotrovimab** there were also a **lot of concerns** that the company **would be able** to set up **manufacturing**. That concern is **now dismissed**, as they confirmed their manufacturing capacity and delivery dates: For example, **only in the US** the schedule is **300,000** doses in **January**, **450,000** doses **Feb-March** or even more. The estimates were **1M doses** in **Q1**, **1M doses** or more in **Q2**. Due to unknown **demand in Q3-Q4,** there is no guidance.\n4. Many countries set Sotrovimab in **their guidances** for treatment just in the last 2 weeks. Meaning more spending/demand in the near term.\n\n# Revenue\n\nThe last known contract price was **$2100 per dose** for the  US.\n\nAssuming the 1,700,000 contracts at $2100 - it is **$3.57B in sales** of a drug.\n\nAccording to the contract with GSK - **72.5%** of the revenue share is in favor of VIR.  So that's \\~**2.58B of VIR's share (minus the cost of sales).** Cost of Sales appears to be small:\n\nAccording to VIR's Q3 [SEC report](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1706431/000095017021003057/vir-20210930.htm) Cost of Sales are :\n\n>In the third quarter, well over 50,000 courses delivered and $102.4M of sotrovimab collaboration revenue recognized  \n>  \n>The cost of collaboration revenue was $7.8 million.\n\nSo: $7.8m from the 102.4M revenue =  **Gross margin is \\~93%**.\n\nSo, most of the money settles as a profit.\n\n# Analyst estimates\n\nAfter Q3 we had several Analyst Upgrades:\n\nÔ∏èDate: 08-12-2021.

The Pipeline includes a promising **HIV Vaccine** platform (in partnership with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation), **HBV treatment**, **Influenza** Vaccine, and of course **Covid monoclonal antibody cocktails**. ([link](https://www.vir.bio/pipeline/)).\n* Yesterday they announced many updates & taking forward research and development using cash that they make.\n* Credible and experienced CEO & Board Member - [George Scangos](https://www.vir.bio/team/george-scangos-ph-d/), which increased BIOGEN's shareholder value from $5B **to $35B** company from 2010 till 2017.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Concerns of future demand\n\n* It is now common sense that Omicron will pass and there will be no need in antivirals. That will lower the demand, but will not make it 0.\n* I've been analyzing the company, the COVID situation, [usage of monoclonal antibodies in the ](https://www.phe.gov/emergency/events/COVID19/therapeutics/distribution/Pages/data-tables.aspx)[US](https://www.phe.gov/emergency/events/COVID19/therapeutics/distribution/Pages/data-tables.aspx), authorizations, media, and social media, official countries Healthcare systems guidelines. The demand in latest Covid wave is around 10,000,000 doses. Even after the wave ended the demand will be there. With Sotrovimab's current market share around 11% -> with supply increasing it will be more like 30-40%.\n* Sotrovimab might stay here as a Best class drug. Multiple in vitro and in vivo studies show effectiveness against Omicron for the Sotrovimab, while others are ineffective. Real-world data confirming the benefit. Scientific evidence that it will be effective against all the next variants([link](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/VIR/vir-biotechnology-announces-new-research-describing-the-structural-4vqvcwpr9obj.html)).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The \"Pfizer Pill\"(Paxlovid) concern\n\n* The guidelines in the US, UK, Japan, Switzerland, France, Australia, Canada have been updated in late December - Early January. The treatment of high-risk populations will stay with Sotrovimab, not Paxlovid.\n* Paxlovid antiviral pills for mild/at home/early use got approved (no real-world data yet, only Phase 2 studies, but a lot of credit nevertheless ). Paxlovid already got a 14 billion contract from US Gov.  Antiviral production cycle is \\~8-9 months. So, no supply till June 2022.\n* It will take share from monoclonals, but it's all about guidelines. And in many cases, they are in favor of Sotrovimab.\n\nAnd even with 5x less demand in monoclonal antibodies, Sotrovimab can sell \\~1,000,000 doses for many years to come.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Summary\n\nThe final situation now after the news (11.01.2022):\n\n* 1,700,000 doses x $2100 each in confirmed contracts = **$3.57B with most delivery Q1-Q2 2022.**\n* **72.5%** of the revenue share with GSK is in favor of VIR.\n* Gross margin \\~92-93% (Cost of sales 7%) according to Q3 report\n* Delivered 750,000 doses last Q (vs 50,000 in Q3)\n* Updated manufacturing speed: 1,000,000 doses / Quarter\n* Unknown demand in **Q3-Q4 2022** (up to 2,000,000 doses ???)\n* **4.5B** market cap, **$700M** in cash & **$200M** in assets\n* **HIV** vaccine (phase1) data pending in partnership with Gates Foundation\n* Multiple **HBV** treatment in Phase ¬Ω  (I think this pipeline has itself **EV\\~2B)**\n* Second COVID mAb (VIR-7832) in trials\n\n**Best case scenario**: the demand of mAbs which is around 10,000,000 per year stays here for another year, with Sotrovimab staying best in class drug favored in many country‚Äôs guidelines.\n\n**Most probable scenario**: after successful 2022, mAb usage decreases to 2,500,000 in 2023, but Sotrovimab market share increases from 11% now to 40% for next several years, bringing the next 3-4 year sales \\~ 1 million doses/year.\n\n**Worst case scenario**: if Covid ends here and now within a half of the year..  you get a company with **4B cash** and a rich pipeline in HBV, experience in antivirals for future pandemics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n==========\n\n**Disclosure**: I am a retail trader.
