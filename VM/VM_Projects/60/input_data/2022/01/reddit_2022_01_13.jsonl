{"title": "Rivian - why I am doubtful", "selftext": "*Rivian Automotive*\n\nMarket Cap: 76.4B\nEmployees: 11,000+\nCars Delivered: 920\nDaniel Foelber said ‚ÄúRaising an eyebrow or two at Rivian's lofty valuation isn't unwarranted given the company is even more unproven than other up-and-coming EV companies like Lucid Group and Nio. However, one of the reasons why it's best to steer clear of Rivian is that the management team hasn't proven itself on the public stage.‚Äù\n\nThe company's unproven manufacturing, ability to deliver and service its vehicles, and the unknown cost of its charging network are the single most important reasons why Rivian stock is worth avoiding. Rivian, like Tesla, intends to build its own fast-charging network because it believes it is a necessary service for its remote clients. It remains to be seen how that additional cost will affect the company's profitability. Investors may recall that not long ago, Tesla had a fantastic product but was drowning in a sea of production issues. It's one thing to build a great car. It is a completely different skill to mass produce and deliver it. Given the list of uncertainties and Rivian's exorbitant valuation, there simply isn't a compelling reason to buy the stock today.\n\nRivian reported a net loss of $426 million in 2019, which increased to $1 billion the following year. The company is expected to invest heavily in product development and expand its manufacturing capabilities, both of which will necessitate significant capital expenditures. Rivian will need to raise capital several times in the future to fund its expansion plans, which will result in shareholder dilution, making it a high-risk bet given the company's sky-high valuations.\n\n\n*Amazon deal is not binding*\n\nRivian is backed my Amazon, one of the largest company in the world with over 20% stake in the company. However, Amazon chose to buy from Stellantis, which is trying to tap into market mania for EVs. This would allow the company to catch up with Rivian.\nAmazon's purchase of Rivian's vehicles represented the largest purchase of light-duty EVs in history, as part of the tech giant's stated goal of eliminating its carbon footprint by 2040.\n\nHowever, Amazon, which owns a stake in Rivian, is not required to complete the purchase. When the EV maker filed for its initial public offering (IPO) last August, it stated in regulatory filings that the agreement with the retailer \"does not contain a minimum order quantity or minimum purchase requirements,\" and that purchase orders \"are subject to modification or cancellation upon notice.\"\n\n*C level management left in the midst of production ramp up*\n\nRivian Automotive Inc.'s COO stepped down last month, just as the EV maker was ramping up production for the first time. Rod Copes left the company after holding the position since March 2020. The company said in a statement that Copes ‚Äúbegan a phased retirement from Rivian several months ago, affording the team continuity as we moved toward production ramp.‚Äù His duties have been distributed across the leadership team, the company said", "id": "s300se", "created_utc": 1642082255.0, "score": 59, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 63, "comments": [{"body": "Opened a short position today.

They gave Tesla all the time in the world to build up their production and bring their costs down to make their EV's more competitive. \n\nRivian won't have that luxury of time, because they've already squandered it by taking 12 years to bring a vehicle to market. The traditional automakers are all upping their investments into EV's significantly these days because they don't want to give another EV company the opportunity to become a big player in the automaker space.", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": ">How many years did it take TSLA to get to where they are? 10+ years and they are still not at 1,000,000 cars.\n\nThe 1st million is always the hardest.

They raise capital and don't turn a profit for many years. hard to read an article when the author doesn't seem to know Business 101.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are very significant challenges for Rivian, but lets just state them clearly and not obfuscate. The R1T and R1S are very good vehicles, but the company will not survive on those two models alone. They have to produce a high volume affordable vehicle, to justify their high valuation. Making 10,000, or even 50,000 70k luxury SUVs will not be adequate. And this explains the share price action. As soon as they show definitive plans for a smaller cheaper vehicle and prove they are going to build it by creating factory space (technically already confirmed), they'll be off to the races.
