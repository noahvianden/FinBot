{"title": "Outlook for the US Stock Market in 2022 (Bear vs. Bull Discussion)", "selftext": "Most of the content that I've seen posted on this subreddit has been people very concerned over the recent price drops with people wondering if they should sell before a crash or double down on their positions that have recently fallen in price. There are a couple bull and bear arguments, but I haven't seen both of them written up together in a more neutral tone. **Full disclaimer;** the best course of action is usually to simply buy and hold over decades. Trying to time the market rarely works for retail investors. The investors with the highest returns were those that were dead.\n\n**The State of the Economy**\n\nThere are multiple factors that affect the market and differing opinions on how all of them will play out.\n\nVery high inflation at 7% reported for December 2021. \n\nSupply shortages that seem to be on almost everything and very long shipping times.\n\nWith Covid omicron there were worries about more lockdowns and how they will affect the markets.\n\n**The Bull Thesis**\n\nTo combat inflation the FED will likely be raising interest rates to 0.75-1% over the course of the year starting in March. Additionally, the FED is tapering their quantitative easing policy to decrease the amount of money that they put into the system which should reduce inflation as well. \n\nIf we still suffer from longer periods of inflation, it may not negatively affect financial markets. There are limited other options to invest that scale of money. We were seeing inflated equity values for 2021 and that may continue into 2022. Selling would leave you holding currency that is being devalued by inflation.\n\nSupply shortages that we have seen in the economy are temporary and over time companies will jump in to maximize profit by selling a good that is needed. The plan to start bringing semiconductor manufacturing to mainland US will alleviate our present chip shortage. Opening manufacturing closer to consumption reduces shipping costs and could lead to higher profit margins. The timeline on that trend could be long-term around 2-10 years to reach full production on more industry. More middle class jobs would mean higher wages and more economic activity.\n\nIn 2022 we are entering the 3rd year of the covid pandemic and many people are sick of full lockdowns. Many areas have learned to take more reasonable measures and allow businesses to stay open and not make too much of an impact. Wearing masks and vaccines are preventing serious outbreaks that threaten to overwhelm our health system like we saw in 2020.\n\n**The Bear Thesis**\n\nInflation is heavily influenced by gas prices, which have been forecast to increase during the summer of 2022. Other costs for cars, food, and housing have all gone up making life increasingly difficult for those at the bottom. The more people have to spend on necessary expenditures, the less they will have for non-essential consumer goods. Furthermore, inflation directly affects asset prices because it changes the present value of future earnings. In inflationary periods, stocks with a low P/E ratio are considered value stocks and are considered safe because they have consistent returns and trend well with the currency. In our current market P/E ratios are quite high, making it difficult to find safe harbor. Furthermore, the FED's policy of tapering further reduces the buying pressure on the markets. In an already tenuous position, the FED must choose between raising interest rates and tapering to prevent inflation or continuing to run the money printer and let inflation run wild.\n\nSupply shortages could be ongoing and significantly hamper economic activity. Some of the shortages we've seen include food, semiconductors, and almost any manufactured good. The US has exported most of our manufacturing capabilities and it will take a long time to bring it back. We already have a low unemployment rate, so it may be difficult to bring too many jobs to the market without raising wages enough to cause inflation to rise further. Some shortages including food are artificially used by companies to raise prices (meat packing), while others are due to a shortage of labor transporting the goods. Additionally, the food itself is less available due to poor crop conditions caused by global warming. This trend is likely to trend worse and food shortages may be more severe over time.\n\nOmicron is causing nations around the world to lockdown and there may be some detrimental impact on entertainment and consumer spending. Omicron might just be a sign that we may never be free from covid and periodic lockdowns will prevent recovery stocks from reaching their 2019 peaks again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Summary**\n\nInflation, interest rates, and the FED's tapering of their quantitative easing are the biggest direct affecters of the overall market price. How the FED handles raising interest rates and how the markets respond will be seen in March when the first rate hike will likely occur.\n\nOver time we will see if supply shortages work themselves out or prolong. We will also need to wait to see if covid shutdowns will continue to have a significant effect on the economy, or if we are nearing the end of the pandemic from the usage of vaccines.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf there are any pieces of information that are inaccurate, please let me know.
