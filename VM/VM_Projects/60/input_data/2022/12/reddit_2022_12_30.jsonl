{"title": "My thoughts before I take a break.", "selftext": "I'm going to take some time off Reddit & other social media + from being super active in the market. I'm doing very poorly in school, and my mental & physical health has deteriorated with my obsession with making money and watching the market 10 hours a day. It has paid off so far, but there is more to life than just money. Let me share some of my thoughts before I take a break.\n\nCurrent positioning across all 7 accounts:\n\n\\~250k $ASTS shares long.\n\n524 shares short $CAT.\n\n\\~6000 shares short $NVDA.\n\nI am currently using margin.\n\n**Quick Highlights:**\n\n**For $ASTS long:** AST Spacemobile wants to provide cellular broadband connectivity to the entire world. There are billions of people worldwide who don't have reliable access to the internet, and AST wants to close the digital divide through its patented technology. They will have little to no customer acquisition costs and are strategically partnered with AT&T, Vodafone, Nokia, American Tower, Rakuten, etc. I personally believe that it provides one of the most asymmetrical r / r on the long side of the market right now. There is a chance that the stock goes to 0 if the tech/funding does not work as planned, but if the tech/funding works as planned, a 100x+ is possible (run your own DCF model). The tech has been partially validated through BW1 (cell phone in orbit) and BW2 (antenna on the ground), and also their strategic partners have done extensive DD on them. Full validation of technology is currently set to be completed in the coming months. There are also funding risks, but there is the possibility that the Rural 5g Fund and their strategic partners might close the current funding gap. This is a high-risk potentially high-reward play so only risk what you can afford to lose. There might be some risks that I am unaware of. Do your own DD.\n\n**This is both a trade and an investment for me.**\n\nHere is some more extensive DD\n\n[https://transhumanica.com/asts](https://transhumanica.com/asts)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/q6tqw8/ast\\_spacemobile\\_the\\_starlink\\_of\\_smartphones/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/q6tqw8/ast_spacemobile_the_starlink_of_smartphones/)\n\n**For $NVDA short:**  A lot of demand was pulled forward during COVID in the semiconductor industry. There's geopolitical risk. Sales are slowing. Insane P/E in a risk-off environment. It's still priced like a hypergrowth stock when it's already one of the largest companies in the world. Margin compressions. Supply chain issues. The growth story is dead right now, and the current market is just unforgiving. Etc. Etc. Etc. I don't think these factors are fully priced in yet. And the rally from recent lows was just insanity. I'm not going to give a PT, but I'm still holding my short at the given moment. I personally think we see much lower, but the market can stay irrational longer than we can stay solvent.\n\n**For $CAT short:** Pretty simple thesis: It's a cyclical business and we're entering a recession. + Risk-free rate has changed. No reason it should be up \\~50% from the yearly lows and trading at/near all-time highs in this type of environment. I don't believe the growth story here. Construction should slow down worldwide as the recession hits, and assets will be repriced with the change in the risk-free rate.\n\nOne of my theories that Jeremy Grantham shares are that not all sectors/stocks will fall at the same time. They fall in a staggered fashion. This will let us rotate our shorts around and keep compounding gains if you can get the timing down right.\n\nLet me share another interesting thing (\\*wink-wink\\*): Look at the Dow, and the individual stocks that make up the index. There are a lot of institutions hiding there, and a lot of the recent moves in those individual stocks do not make sense in this risk-off environment. I'm looking at you $CAT (there are a bunch more).\n\nBe careful of bear market rallies, inflation coming roaring back (look at history), earnings recession etc. Stay rooted in reality.\n\nI will be active till the new year, and I am not sure when I will be back.\n\nNone of this is financial advice, and without notice, and at any given moment, I can open new positions and close any position that I may have. I might also change my mind on how I view these companies and the broader market. As always, do your own DD, and never risk what you cannot tolerate losing.
