{"title": "Summary of Carter's Trading Strategy From TastyTrade Rising Star Interview", "selftext": "Greetings, Traders.\n\nTom Sosnoff of TastyTrade [interviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNAZHFdkC14) a young trader named Carter in a live stream from Thu 1 Dec 2022. If you don't want to watch the interview, here's a summary of his strategy.\n\n**Trader**\n\nCarter Dobbelmann, a 20-year-old from San Jose, CA.\n\n**Claim to Fame**\n\nTurned $500 into $30,000 within 1.5 years.\n\n**Affiliations:**\n\n* He's on \"Hourglass Trader.\" (Google it.)\n* He has replied to comments on the TastyTrade video.\n\n**Strategy**: Selling Volatility\n\n* Exclusively trades options.\n* Roughly follows what TastyTrade recommends.¹\n* Initially, gambled with six significantly OTM *Long Calls* on TSLA, to go from $500 to $7,000 without knowing anything about the stock market, options, or trading and getting extremely lucky. Then, gambled $7,000 on AMZN calls and blew away $6,000 to drop down to $1,000. After learning a more reasonable way of trading, he looks for high-IV underlyings and:\n\n1. Shorts puts for a credit;\n2. Shorts call spreads for a credit; and\n3. Shorts put spreads for a credit.\n\n* Because he sells high volatility, he's always looking at IV rank.\n\n**Tactics**\n\n* Trades with the trend of the underlying using vertical spreads.\n* Runs *Short Call Spreads* when a stock breaks down, and *Short Puts Spreads* when it rallies.\n* If he sees evidence that an active play is reversing, he'll add the opposite spread type from what he initially did. If he shorted a call spread, he'd short a put spread. Or if he shorted a put spread, he'd short a call spread.\n\n**Trade Parameters**\n\n* Sets OTM striking prices, going a little above or below the *expected move*² based on ±1∙ σ and TA.\n* Uses DTE = \\[7, 30\\] days (usually not more than 25 days) on individual companies.\n* Uses DTE = \\[20, 30\\] on SPX.\n\n**Underlyings**\n\n* Is indifferent to the underlying.\n* Says he plays indexes, e.g. SPX.\n* Initially, he traded CLOV and AMC.\n* He recently played SI and GME.\n\n**Trading Activity**\n\n* He places 10 to 15 trades per day.\n* He maintains a portfolio of fifteen concurrent positions with many different underlyings.\n* With a $30,000 account, he's likely risking $2,000 on each position.\n\n**Profit-Taking**\n\n* He exits whenever he captures 25% to 50% of the maximum theoretical profit, usually closer to the latter.\n* Because he uses distributed expirations (e.g. DTE = 7, 14, 20 days), he takes profits virtually every day.\n\n**Risk Management**\n\n* If he ran a *Short Call Spread* and the underlying kept moving up, he'd roll the spread up and widen the striking prices.\n* This implies that if he ran a *Short Put Spread* and the underlying keeps moving down, he'd roll the spread down and widen the striking prices.\n* He doesn't hold beyond the point of capturing 50% of the maximal theoretical profit to try to minimize risk.\n* He manages risk very actively and aggressively.\n\n**Unknown or Unanswered Questions**\n\n* How he builds a watchlist.\n* What time(s) of day he typically enters/exits trades.\n* Quantity of each trade type.\n* Scaling strategy.\n* Underlying selection criteria.\n* DTE criteria.\n* Trigger(s) to roll a trade.\n* Trigger(s) to exit a trade.\n* Spread width.\n* Average number of distinct underlyings in his portfolio.\n* Win rate.\n* Average profit per trade.\n\n**My Thoughts**\n\nThis gives us an outline of what he's doing, but the Devil is in the details, and a lot is missing. Without knowing what IV rank threshold (and other criteria) he's using for scanning for underlyings, the spread width, what decision-making criteria he uses to trigger a roll, etc., we just don't have enough information to be able to try to replicate this.\n\nWe also don't know anything about how he's making decisions about where the market is likely to go, overall. Trading during the week of Mon 5 Dec 2022 might be dangerous because more macroeconomic data is being released. On Tue 13 Dec, the CPI will be released. The following day, the Fed will announce its interest rate decision at 2:00 pm ET, followed half an hour later by The JPow's press conference. It would be imprudent to try to trade oblivious to these important macroeconomic catalysts.\n\nThis interview is interesting, but ultimately leaves us guessing. Without additional information and a comprehensive list of trades over a three-month period, so that we could look at the transaction times and replay the price action to understand the decision-making, I think that it's impossible to truly figure out what a trader is doing and whether it could have a sustainable edge. What would help the most is an Excel spreadsheet containing every trade's transaction time, action, and a justification for that action. It's impossible to reverse-engineer what we've heard in just the interview well enough to put it to the test.\n\nWe can reduce the unknowns by just focusing on SPX. If someone can track Carter down, it would be interesting to get him to fill in the blanks. We really need to understand how he minimizes losses from positions that go against him. To manage risk \"aggressively,\" what triggers him to roll a position, and how soon in the life cycle of a trade that's in trouble does he do this?\n\n**Endnotes**\n\n¹TastyTrade's free *Beginner Options Course* is [here](https://tastytrade.thinkific.com/courses/beginner-options-course).\n\n²To calculate an *expected move*, see [this](https://www.projectfinance.com/expected-move/).\n\n**Future Summaries**\n\nIf you liked this summary and would like to see others, please upvote my post.\n\nArtem", "id": "zcye99", "created_utc": 1670219271.0, "score": 204, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 65, "comments": [{"body": "Time will tell.

If you learn more about “kurtosis”, you will see how it’s measured and where it’s high. Many new traders fail to take this into account when measuring risk.\n\nWider spreads don’t help you; they add more risk to your position. A lot of these TastyTrade strategies I see will take an initial losing trade, close it and open a higher probability (worse risk/reward) wider spread in order to cover losers. For example, a spread worth $1 can come from a 10 pt spread or a 20 pt spread (with greater risk) or multiple .50 spreads. This works great until that trade also goes in your face and now your losses compound.

I didn't get the impression that *Short Puts* are a prominent part of his trading strategy, but that he's making money by running *Short Put Spreads* and *Short Call Spreads*, and scaling into and out of them very deftly and dynamically as he watches price action.\n\nTo make a very rough approximation, to achieve the result that he claims (without any additional paid-in capital) during that 1.5 years:\n\n* If he used 100% of his capital every time, and held each trade for an average of ten days, he would have needed to book +7.90% in profit on every trade.\n* If he compounded that 53 more times (to get to 1.5 years of trading), with a 100% win rate, he would get to $30,347.86.\n\nMaybe there's a simpler way to look at it. Consider just a single trade. He starts with $500.00, and needs to book $39.50 (+7.90%) in profit within ten days. That's certainly achievable by shorting a put spread. For example:\n\n7 ∙ BTO AMC 16 Dec 6.00 P@0.10  \n7 ∙ STO AMC 16 Dec 7.00 P@0.41\n\nMax gain = $217.00  \nBreak-even = $6.69/share  \nMax loss = $483.00\n\nGiven that he says that he's executing ten to fifteen trades per day, and aggressively managing active positions, all he'd need to do is capture $39.50 of that $217.00.\n\nPerhaps he might use lower striking prices with more contracts, like this:\n\n11 ∙ BTO AMC 16 Dec 5.50 P@0.05  \n11 ∙ STO AMC 16 Dec 6.00 P@0.10\n\nMax gain = $55.00  \nBreak-even = $5.95/share  \nMax loss = $495.00\n\nThis looks a lot better, but if AMC were to take a sudden dive, he'd get into trouble quickly.\n\nWithout knowing exactly what he's doing with those ten or fifteen trades per day, it's impossible to know how he's really managing risk. How many of those trades are new positions, or additions (scaling in) to an existing position, as opposed to risk management moves on existing positions? Without a comprehensive log of transactions, it's impossible to figure out what he's doing.\n\nGetting back to the $30k, to get to that point, he'd need an insanely high win rate. To achieve that, either he's a risk management magician who hasn't explained how he's doing it, or he has a 100% win rate, but the latter is impossible to imagine over the course of 1.5 years.\n\nSo, the key—if he truly has been this successful—has to come from whatever it is that he's doing to manage risk. He says that he's rolling up or down, and widening the spread, but that doesn't tell us much. We need details.\n\nMy gut instinct told me that there's no way that he could have possibly gotten from $500 to $30k without a large number of insane gamma squeezes by buying *Long Calls* or *Long Puts*. But who knows? It would be nice to have him come here and answer questions.\n\nWe also have to be aware of the fact that Tom Sosnoff *has* been fooled in the past. We can't put it past anyone to play the same game again, in order to make lots of people who watch TastyTrade videos aware of him so that he can use his fifteen minutes of fame to launch a future trading community and charge a subscription, which is surely the fastest path to financial independence that there is for a twenty-year-old.\n\nArtem", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Would PDT not trigger if he does it many of these in a day ?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yes!
