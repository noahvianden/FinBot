However, the idea that his tweets on the morning of Jan 8th violated Twitter's terms of policy is just false because they themselves admit he didn't. Trump's actions outside of Twitter may have been a threat to democracy but it's hard to argue his tweets indeed were. Twitter even wrote in 2019 that \"Our mission is to provide a forum that enables people to be informed and to engage their leaders directly,\" and their aim is to ‚Äúprotect the public‚Äôs right to hear from their leaders and to hold them to account.‚Äù. It's funny because you say they tried to defend democracy and Elon is doing the opposite, when they violated their own policies by silencing him. And I think most people would agree that freedom of speech is necessary for a healthy functioning democracy as long as your not breaking the law. Elon's Twitter recently removed people that were providing accurate assassination coordinates for him which is in line with their policy.
