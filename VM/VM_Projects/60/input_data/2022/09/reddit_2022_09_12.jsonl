{"title": "The DOJ says Google illegally dominates the search market by paying billions of dollars to other companies. Do you agree that it is illegal?", "selftext": "Google pays billions of dollars to other companies -- Apple, Samsung Electronics, etc. -- to keep its search as the default option on phones and in browsers, something the Department of Justice (DOJ) believes creates an illegal dominance over the search market.\n\nDeals like this ensure companies like Apple stay out of the search business. The practice has gone on for years. Google, at one point, paid Apple between $8 billion and $12 billion annually to appear as the default search engine on iPhones and other Apple devices, according to a law suit filed in 2020.\n\nDOJ attorney Kenneth Dintzer didn‚Äôt disclose the amount Google spends to remain the default search engine on browsers and U.S. mobile phones, but described it as ‚Äúenormous numbers,‚Äù reports Bloomberg.\n\n‚ÄúGoogle invests billions securing defaults, knowing people won‚Äôt change them,‚Äù Dintzer told Judge Amit Mehta during a hearing in Washington, admitting that Google buys ‚Äúdefault exclusivity because defaults matter a lot.‚Äù\n\nIn 2019, Google began giving Android users in Europe a choice to select a provider to power a search box on their device's home screen, and as the default in Chrome when installed. The changes complied with a competitive European Union ruling. The EU fined Google, saying it had an unfair advantage by pre-installing its Chrome browser and Google search app on Android smartphones and notebooks.\n\nThe change gave users with a phone running the Android operating system and Chrome browser an option to customize and personalize their device, choose and change their search engine based on their preference. It included selecting the apps to download.\n\nGoogle, for example, added private, decentralized search engine Presearch as a default option on all new and factory-reset Android devices in the U.K. and Europe.\n\nSince Google added Presearch 2021, its daily searches have grown from about 200,000 a day to more than 4 million, said Alex Carrabre, head of growth at Presearch. ‚ÄúAt the peak it was 6 million per day in the past 20 months,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just in the Europe economic area.‚Äù\n\nCarrabre estimates Android has about 70% of smartphone market share in Europe, which means there‚Äôs strong potential for the fledgling search engine to grow its user base.\n\nGoogle‚Äôs private contracts with companies like Apple, and Samsung form the basis of the DOJ‚Äôs antitrust lawsuit, which alleges the company has sought to maintain its online search monopoly in violation of antitrust laws.\n\nThe trial isn‚Äôt expected to start until next year. Thursday‚Äôs hearing was a daylong tutorial where each side laid out its views on Google‚Äôs business.\n\n[https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/377584/google-exclusivity-and-dojs-battle-over-search.html](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/377584/google-exclusivity-and-dojs-battle-over-search.html)\n\nThe DOJ says Google (Alphabet, Inc: GOOGL) creates an illegal dominance over the search market by paying billions of dollars to other companies to keep its search as the default option.
