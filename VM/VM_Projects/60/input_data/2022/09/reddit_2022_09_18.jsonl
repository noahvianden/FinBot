{"title": "Palantir stock analysis and valuation - Lots of uncertainty", "selftext": "This week's valuation - Palantir, was the most suggested company for me to value in the last two months, so I hope you enjoy it.\n\nAs always, the post will be divided into a few segments:\n\n1. Understanding the business\n2. Understanding the historical financial performance\n3. Laying down some assumptions to value the company\n4. Valuing the company based on assumptions significantly different than mine\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What is Palantir? - Understanding the business**\n\nIn one sentence - It is a software company specializing in big data analytics.\n\nIt has been one of the most discussed companies in the last 2 years after its IPO back in September 2020. However, most do not know that the company is actually older than Facebook, it was founded back in 2003.\n\nTo give some background, Peter Thiel is one of the founders, who was also part of PayPal. One of the challenges that they had was how to solve was identify fraudulent transactions. So, Palantir started as an attempt to solve it. Of course, as models based on Machine Learning / Artificial intelligence are being developed, they not only can be used in other fields where data is available, but they also get better over time.\n\nToday, more than 2 decades later, the company has both governmental institutions as clients (US Army, UK Royal Navy, UK NHS, Bavarian Police, etc.) as well as commercial clients (Morgan Stanley, Airbus, Fiat Chrysler, Ferrari, Merck, etc.). \n\nOver 60% of the revenue comes from the US, 11% from the UK, and the remaining 39% from other countries (none of which contributes individually to more than 10% of the company's revenue).\n\nWhat's worth mentioning is that they have a bit of a different business model that allows them to have a foot in the door a bit quicker than others. It's divided into three steps:\n\nStep 1: **Acquire** \\- In this step, Palantir bears the cost of the pilot project and \"acquires new customers\". The margins are negative and they're losing money in each pilot project, but these are not large investments.\n\nStep 2: **Expand** \\- This is when the company starts earning some revenue, the contribution margin becomes positive and they continue with vertical integration of the software within the organization\n\nStep 3: **Scale** \\- This is where the value is actually created, it is self-explanatory, involving scaling the software to other branches/locations of the company.\n\nThe software uses the data available (coming from different sources, also both structured and unstructured) to find trends and meaningful insights that can be used for better decision-making.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Historical financial performance**\n\nThe company's revenue has grown from $600m in 2018 to $1,7b for the last twelve months (ending June 2022). The growth wasn't stable, ranging from 20% to 50%. As this is a software company, high gross margins are expected. In the case of Palantir, that's close to 80%.\n\nHowever, their other operating expenses have been quite high (as % of revenue), here's a short summary: \n\nSales & Marketing - 78% back in 2018 --> 37% LTM\n\nResearch & Development - 48% back in 2018 --> 20% LTM\n\nSelling, general & administrative - 54% in 2018 --> 35% LTM\n\nCombined: 177% in 2018 - 92% for the LTM\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is quite clear that the 80% gross profit has not been yet sufficient to cover the other expenses, the company is yet to be profitable. Although, they did make improvements compared to 2018.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, how does this company survive when losing money every year?**\n\nFrom an accounting point of view, the company is not profitable, however, from a cash point of view, they aren't losing money. Part of the compensation for employees/management is in shares/share options. This would be exactly the same if the company issues new shares and uses the cash to compensate the employees/management. In both cases, there's no cash remaining at the company and the original shareholders are being diluted. How much dilution are we talking about? If you owned 10% of Palantir at the end of 2020, you would own around 8.8% as of June 2020.\n\nThe company has around $2,5b in cash/short-term investments and is debt-free (apart from leases). Share-based compensation has good and bad sides, but I won't go into that in this post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The growth story**\n\nIn the last couple of years, we've seen quite some growth stories of companies with huge growth that declined 70-80% when the growth slowed. Palantir belongs to this group. After the IPO, they grew their revenue by 40-50%. Assuming any company grows at such high rates for an extended period of time is very unlikely. The moment the growth declines, that's when the share price adjusts. This is one of the reasons why IPOs are in most cases overpriced. They have good numbers in the short-run and the valuation is based on those expectations (that are not sustainable).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Assumptions about the future**\n\nThe management is aiming for 30% revenue every year in the next 5 years. That doesn't mean they'll deliver that. In fact, they're guiding for revenue growth of close to 25% for 2022.\n\nAs for the operating margin (currently -13%), they're expecting it to grow to 35%. However, in this percentage, they're not taking share-based compensation into account, which is unfair in my opinion as it is an expense for the existing shareholders. There are two ways to account for the share dilution:\n\n1. Use the assumption of 35% operating margin that takes out the share-based compensation, in which case the estimates are closer to the actual cash movements. However, adjust the number of shares outstanding for future dilution.\n2. Use the assumption of 25% operating margin (as SBC is expected to be 10% of total revenue) and leave the shares outstanding as they are.\n\nThe second approach is easier to implement, hence I'm using it in my model.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy assumptions are as follows:\n\n **- Revenue growth** of 25% for the next year, followed by close to 25% up until year 5, and then slowly decrease to the risk-free rate of 3.2%. You can argue that this is too conservative and that Palantir can grow for more than 10 years. However, the majority of the companies become stable/mature after a few decades, so there's a high probability that the same will happen to Palantir. Could I be wrong? Absolutely! However, I'd rather be wrong and underestimate its potential, so if I end up buying it at any point, positive surprises are always welcomed. I haven't met anyone who was sad because a company outperformed their expectation and made more money than expected.\n\n**- Operating margin** of -10% for the next year, slowly improving to 10% in year 5 and increasing to 25% by year 10.\n\n**- A discount rate of 12.96%** that decreases to 10.76% over time as the company matures and risk decreases (WACC-based)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on these assumptions, the fair value of the company is $9,6b (**$4.66/share)**\n\n The current market cap is $16.05b ($7.78/share)\n\n*Note: I have taken into account the cash, debt, and deferred taxes on their balance sheet as well as the outstanding equity options.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n **What if my assumptions are significantly wrong?**\n\nBased on the assumptions above, the revenue will grow by 445% to $9,5b in 10 years and the operating margin will be 25%.\n\nI am aware that my assumptions could be significantly wrong. So, let's take a look at how the value of the company (per share) will change based on different assumptions regarding the revenue 10 years from now and the operating margin: \n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Revenue / Op. margin|20%|25%|30%|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|330% ($7,5b)|$3.00|$3.74|$4.41|\n|445% ($9,5b)|$3.75|$4.66|$5.52|\n|600% ($12,2b)|$4.68|$5.84|$6.93|\n|750% ($14,8b)|$5.62|$7.02|$8.34|\n\nThe table illustrates how much the company needs to grow and how high should the operating margin be so that Palantir is fairly valued today. \n\nFor the last row of 750%, the company needs to grow between 25-30% annually for every year in the next 8 years. \n\nIn 2020, the company provided some information about its total addressable market (\"TAM\"). In most cases, companies exaggerate when it comes to this. Here's what Palantir shared:\n\n\\- Commercial TAM - $56b\n\n\\- US government TAM - $26b\n\n\\- International government TAM - $37b\n\nWith the last scenario, they would capture over 10% of their initial TAM which I don't expect to significantly grow over time. Of course, I could be wrong.\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts on Palantir, their offering, the valuation, or anything else that you believe adds value to the analysis.", "id": "xhibl1", "created_utc": 1663511799.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 62, "comments": [{"body": "PLTR management needs to disclose how many clients are in which stages of the Acquire, Expand, Scale.

Thats the elephant in the room.\n\nThere is a saying where I come from (Iraq) \"foraging watermelon seeds from shit.\"\n\nThe elephant is this. A) Is the problem they are solving worth solving? B) Are they actually solving it?\n\nIts sort of like the old politician trick. When asked a question you dont like, ignore it, ask a different question, then pretend to solve that question.\n\nThis is a problem with many analytics done today. Reason being, all the obvious and important analytics were already being done long before the new methods came about. The only one that were not, were the ones too complex for humans to crunch (for example, teaching a computer to drive).  \n\nFor example, banks figured out how to correlate risk with lending long ago before computing. They used a variety of methods to do that using many different variables. Along the way, they tried to incorporate new data as it came along and offer products based on that. Sometimes this had bad results because the assumptions being made were false (see the financial crash, or great depression, etc), a problem that is not alleviated with computer analysis since the programmers and operators have to make judgement calls with the training data to begin with. To make matters worse, these people working the software are unlikely to be experts in banking.\n\nSo you see there are many things that can go wrong with analytics. Its not always useful. What if the operator of the software or programmer makes a bad fundamental assumption? The analytics would be useless in such case. What if the model that already exists is the same as what the analytics tell you? Its nice to have to have verification but was it worth the millions you sunk into it?\n\nThe point here most of the important stuff has already been discovered except for highly technical stuff.

It just changes as tech advances and practically every software service company ever created is in the business of improving efficiency for their clients in various ways. Thing is not everything requires deep learning to discover... most of the inefficiencies are insanely obvious. For instance, that thing with the oil distribution has probable never been an issue because they dont need optimal output 99% of the time. This is why they never bothered to optimize for max output. This is very common.\n\nWhere I work, we could optimize our server costs further by dissecting every nook and cranny of inefficiency and automating it all, but the reality is we are already 90%+ optimized and we also know that the more complexity you add to a system (by adding automation like that offered by software) can easily lead to disaster. More parts = more things that can fail and it becomes even harder to optimize. So in other words, there is a limit to optimization as you reach for 100%. At some point, the added complexity reduces efficiency or adds risk.\n\nSo what I am trying to say here is that its unlikely that they can help anyone unless that entity has not upgraded to modern tech in the last 2 decades and is very poorly optimized.
