{"title": "0dte, negative gamma trading", "selftext": " Edit: [ here is the obligatory; this is not financial or trading advice. It’s merely for educational purposes.  I would personally not trade this way in a non-professional setting.  Use this post for educational purposes only!]\n\n**I wrote this in response to someone struggling trading short 0-1 dte put spreads in SPX, thought this sub would find it useful.**\n\nI traded 1 and 0 dte strategies professionally for years, it was in a diff market mainly but rules still apply. This basically boils down to managing negative gamma effectively.\n\nPersonally I like to think about it graphically, so in my mind or on the computer, I think about what the terminal payoff graph looks like here. So if you selling ICs/Bflys, it’s the peak in the middle with the long tails. But I have some idea what the real time payoff is- curved line. I would watch both on the computer as theta decays the curve becomes the straight line. Over time you won’t need the computer, except to confirm, you will just know it.\n\nThen I need to manage the negative gamma with delta hedges. So as I accumulate delta you execute to bring you closer to zero delta. How much you hedge depends on the particulars of your market, current IV levels, and what size you are trading.\n\nSo for example:\n\nShort ATM straddle My terminal graph looks like a pyramid. Delta = initially hedged to zero. gamma = negative shit load.\n\nLet’s say price moves down, I’m getting longer delta from my negative gamma.\n\nYou have some rule: Delta = +10, hedge -5. | d = -10, hedge +5\n\nEvery time I hedge my little pyramid on the terminal payout graph rotates to the hedge side and the peak moves down a bit. You just manage this throughout the day. If it’s super choppy you can whittle your pyramid peak into a loss. Or the market can move unidirectionally and you could lose on one side but a lot less than you would unhedged- unless it gaps through your orders- slippage losses. All you really need to pull this off is an options model with intraday decay. It could easily be automated \\[but you need to watch it- still run price gap risk thru your orders\\].\n\nFrom this basic premise the sky is the limit on your creativity. You could use dynamic time so you only use the deltas a couple hours into the future. Or some scaling factor to your hedge rules- farther away the more you hedge. Play with time spreads as a partial gamma hedge; sell short term options buy longer dated ones to offset some Greek risk. Close everything EOD or keep longer stuff open and just trade against it with 1-0 dte stuff.\n\nThe other thing I would say is that be wary and adapt. Over time you will learn when shit is too cheap to sell and manage effectively. In those environments: buy options and gamma scalp trade the positive gamma (opposite of above) or sit on your damn hands and do nothing, if the idea of buying options makes you want to cry.\n\nThe key is having the intraday model where you can dynamically control time and see diff payoffs; terminal, live, some increment forward, etc. I just had one in excel for years and then later Python.\n\n———-———-———-———- **Someone asks what model to use….**\n\nYou can use whatever model you want- BS, Bachelier, Whaley… it honestly doesn't matter in **normal vol** environments with this short of dte they all agree usually or are very close. And you can use the market imp vol to define your Greeks.\n\nAlthough I will say one of the assumptions you drag with you here in this strategy is that you are kind of de facto saying vol is too bid and hence it will decay thru theta or just vega before the market moves too much making your trade a net loser.\n\nSo if you use market imp vol as your delta you are initially over-hedging, this is important later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\------**User then asks how to decay time intraday because it doesn’t appear to be linear to him...**\n\nJust create a time wave for the model to follow that approximates the decay.\n\nSo BS model usually takes a time input as a function of years. So 15 days would be 15 / 365. Or whatever time block you are using.\n\nLet’s say this is excel, So then for intraday decay you set up two columns. Time and percent decay.\n\nYou know at 9:30am it’s 0% At 4:30 (or expiry time) it’s 100%.\n\nYou put some intermediate values in the middle so let’s say it ends up for times:\n\nAnchor Points: 9:30, 9:45, 10:00, 10:15, 10:30, 11:30, 1:00, 2:00, 3:00, 3:30, 3:45, 4:00, 4:30.\n\nThe point I’m trying to make here is that you just have points it doesn’t matter that they are uneven in distance to each other. And you have the percentages of decay at each point that you guesstimate. Then you do some kind of interpolation between the points; cubic, linear, doesn’t really matter as long as it’s somewhat smooth-ish. So your model Greeks don’t jump around like crazy when you reach your anchor points.\n\nThen you just have a black scholes model that uses that interpolation for the decay value based on the actual time of day it is.\n\nBack to the over-hedging issue you could use a slider to warp time back and forth to decide how what delta to use. Most times I would hedge delta based on what I thought delta WOULD be in an hour. I dunno you gotta play with it, use your judgement, experiment.\n\nHere is a link to some VBA code based on Haug’s models for Black-scholes for excel, few years old might need some work and there are more efficient implied volatility finding algorithms you could use (Newton) but this will work for a small number of options <500 or so on a medium power computer.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/bc8njz/simplified\\_black\\_scholes\\_vba\\_code/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=ios\\_app&utm\\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/bc8njz/simplified_black_scholes_vba_code/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)", "id": "xn8kjw", "created_utc": 1664065490.0, "score": 109, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 74, "comments": [{"body": "Unlike most of the commentors here, I am fully sober and I read this post like a rabid greedy dog and still failed to understand even 10% of it. \n\nHowever, it tells me that there is a way to hedge against losses on 0-1 DTE SPX spreads, which I've been scouring the web for.\n\nI've seen others mention hedging spreads on stocks using beta-weighting of the SPX (or SPY or /ES).

Maybe you use larger delta hedges (but probably not)\n* you can set rules to buy back the short legs\n  * to reduce your gamma at a good price or to escape when your expectations change for realised vol\n  * like OP said, sometimes you need to know when not to be a seller of vol\n* you can \"crawl\" a spread by buying a condor/butterfly (not iron condor/butterfly)\n  * migrate your 3220/3200 put credit spread farther OTM to a 3160/3150 PCS (to reduce gamma, free capital, etc) - buy a 3220/3200/3160/3150 put condor\n  * migrate your 4200/4220 call credit spread to 2x 4220/4240 CCS - buy a 4200/4220/4240 call butterfly (+1 4200, -3 4220, +2 4240)\n* carry longer term contracts into expiration to give a buffer for 0DTE trades\n  * eg, take advantage of atypical vol by selling a call spread on wed and then on fri you have a hedge to work against\n      * ...either it still has delta you can trade 0DTE against\n      * ...or it provided profits to trade against or just sit on your hands\n      * ...or it has a loss to drive your strat for selling a put spread or buying back the vol or whatever you now believe about the market, etc\n* cool off a winner or loser by simply reducing/neutralising risk or terming it out (and then close it on tuesday, or carry it into next friday or whatever)\n\nThe point is the overall strategy has to work for you -- and only you can determine that and you can expect lots of experimenting to set your operating parameters.

How much gamma risk is there in this spread?
