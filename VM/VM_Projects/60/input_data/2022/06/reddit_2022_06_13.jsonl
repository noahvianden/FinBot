Price is an advertisement, splits are PR campaigns for same. If your company is doing great, splits are a good way to bring in new investors who will buy and form support areas. These support areas keep the price stable as it continues to climb, with old investors selling off positions to new ones. New investors continue to build positions as they see profit.

Liquidity, availability of open offers to buy or sell, is a direct influence on the movement of price. If demand is high, then sellers will raise the price until demand wanes. When demand is low, anyone who is trying to sell must lower the price until more people are willing to buy.\n\nSupport/Resistance in the market works like it does because investors are willing to keep opening positions at or behind their cost average in the belief the price will go their way. Big money institutions are pivotal in this, because they hold huge positions, building them over time. The money these boys play with is huge, and they're capable of opening/closing massive positions that could swing the whole market.\n\nThe problem they have, is that they can't unwind these positions easily, because in most cases they \\*are\\* what is holding the market up/down. They \\*are\\* the liquidity, they're the ones buying/selling. There are not enough open offers on the market to close their position without driving the price further away from profit. So they play the long game, holding the market at certain levels until enough investors are encouraged to take the bait and push the market further. They slowly close positions to take profit, open new positions, and repeat.\n\nIf big investors are preparing for the worst, this creates a troubling outlook for companies like Amazon because it will remove support by subtracting a lot of their important buyers. How do you counteract that? Bring in new buyers, if they are buying here at this price point, the price will at least stay here until the buying dries up.\n\nSo, how do you advertise your stock? Announce a split, remind people that Amazon is a great company, and that soon its stock will cost only 1/20th what it used to. Last time it was this price, it ended up being worth 20x more! Even if this kind of shit makes no sense to an experienced investor, it's exactly the kind of thing that will bring in any 'safe' investor looking for a good company to invest in. Price is merely an advertisement, but there's only so many ways you can broadcast that price outside of the internet and the news.\n\nIf the price is in decline, and a bunch of new investors are being tempted to buy in, how likely do you think they are to hold and continue buying? If these investors are too weak-handed, and end up capitulating with the rest of the market, then we'll see the whole thing collapse. Meanwhile, old-breed institutional investors, the big money motherfuckers who are exiting longs as we speak, are able to sell until they feel comfortable, without the price actually taking much of a hit. That is, until liquidity runs out, and the price moves to where people are buying. Where big money is buying.\n\nIt's not that retail gets fucked in the long-term. It's that they take the hit short-term while big money gets time to exit, wait it out, and buy back in when they're comfortable.
