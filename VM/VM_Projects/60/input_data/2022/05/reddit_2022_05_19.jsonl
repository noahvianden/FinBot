The median cost of a home in April was still at [a record high](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/mortgage-rates-people-really-getting-210456678.html) of $391,200,\n\nHouse prices nationally have increased 35% since the start of the pandemic. Demand in 2020 and 2021 was fueled by massive fiscal and monetary stimulus and work-from-home options. At the same time, supply has been severely limited with construction slow to catch up.\n\nThe tide may be turning now.\n\nMortgage applications are plunging as borrowing costs are rising. Housing supply is expected to hit the market later this year, when demand is potentially dropping.\n\n‚ÄúHence our belief that the rapid price appreciation of housing could quickly flatten out and possibly reverse,‚Äù writes Knightley.", "id": "ut7xn1", "created_utc": 1652979661.0, "score": 109, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 61, "comments": [{"body": "Remember before you buy, foreclosed houses are generally not in good condition.", "score": 49, "replies": [{"body": "Do people really buy houses without inspecting it's condition?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Sweet summer child", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "People do that when the nearest affordable house is 1000 miles away.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "And they might have liens on the property that take months to clear up.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I hope so I got my 20% down payment, stacked and ready", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Why didn‚Äôt you do this when interest rates were 3.5%???", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "It's about the Netherlands, where interest rates were around 0.8% lol.

{"title": "RIP Walmart", "selftext": "Walmart has a lot more room to fall and here are some of the reasons why:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Walmart is beta testing some new self checkout machines at certain locations - these machines will actually let persons under the age of 21 (and even under 18) purchase alcohol without an employee having to type in a code. It's as easy as clicking \"ok\". This can cause Walmart a lot of legal trouble and potentially cause them to lose their license to sell alcohol at those locations. Don't believe me? If you're in a city that has some go try it.\n2. Walmart still uses mainframes. Yup you read that right - mainframes. The good thing is that they are trying to move off of their mainframes however the bad thing, as we all know, is that for a company like Walmart to do this it will take a lot of time and mistakes. Their warehouses are about to get super fucked up.\n3. The new self checkouts are supposed to leverage AI such that persons checking out need not scan any items. Well, this opens a huge door for loss / theft as the AI system simply not catching an item will mean the customer gets it for free. Likewise, it will become a lot easier for customers to steal $5 to $10 worth of groceries on a $100 basket. That's their margin and then some.\n4. Walmart, like everyone else, is trying to push the ancient idea of grocery store fulfillment (this is how grocery stores used to work) where you give them an 'invoice' for items and they fulfill your order and bring them to your car. Why is this bad? Doesn't it decrease theft? Sure maybe, but more likely the customers doing this have money and so they aren't the type of customer who would steal. Additionally, these customers who have money now no longer have to take their kids through the isles thus they don't get tempted to buy shit they don't need, be it for themselves or to get that 4 year old to stop throwing a fit.\n\nTLDR: Walmart is fucked", "id": "utg11u", "created_utc": 1653002963.0, "score": 16, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 67, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|708|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/udekgq/okay_apes_i_have_the_plan_to_make_us_all_winners/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/u9kr76/how_to_make_money_in_this_shit_storm/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=utg11u)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=utg11u)\n    \nHey /u/SecureDropTheWhistle, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Love all the new DDs after earning misses.", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "You should really look at Dollar General - they mainly exist to serve poor and rural communities and they will have crazy supply chain issues outlined by their earnings.   \n\n\nI'm seeing $180 and below on $DG", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Shit I didn‚Äôt see they have earnings next week.
