I can't remember the name for it but recently miners were selling over 100% of their output ie assets they had saved on top of their production when it's normally 20-40%. I believe it's typical for a lot of miners to sell to cover their costs and either retain the rest (why wouldn't you in a bull market) or sell various amounts but we ain't in a bull market.\n\nIf you go look at https://whattomine.com/\nYou can figure out any profits based on energy prices. \n\nAs someone who bought a gpu for general use and used it in downtime to mine ie I am the smallest miner I can give you my thoughts. I've had to stop mining due to asset price drop along with energy cost raise it means I'd actually be losing money if I was mining. So if you expand that to a farm of 10 say, you've got ten GPUs sitting around turned off, do you want to buy another? No. You might decide to get out the game for a while, sell up what you have left and jump back in when it's profitable again. If that's 2 years from now you might be doubling your production for an extra 30% in cost and no effort.\n\nThe other side to that coin is huuuge miners that pay nothing or next to nothing for their energy can afford to run them regardless, they might want more but where the percentages of how much it the market they make up I don't know, it would be very difficult to tell there's no obvious accounts to go into.

And now us poor regards get shit on while they spread fake news!\n\nEdit:\n\nBecause we’re all stupid regards here, and condescending paper hand bitches keep saying to lookup circuit breakers, I did. Funny that these stupid shits don’t even know what a LULD is.\n\n“Definition Of Limit Up Limit Down Ciruit Breaker\n\nLimit Up Limit Down (LULD) The SEC has recently approved the use of a Limit UP Limit Down (LULD) rule. This rule is designed to ensure that prices of individual securities reflect fundamental prices based on supply and demand and do not move outside of established parameters based on errors or manipulative actions. Upper and lower trading bands will be established based on the average reference price of the security over the preceding 5 minute period. The reference price is the algorithmic mean of all eligible transactions reported during the 5 minute period and does not include transactions reported at a volume weighted average price (VWAP).\n\nApplying \"Limit Up Limit Down Ciruit Breaker\" To Securities Exams:\n\nIf the stock price moves outside of the established bands trading will be paused for 5 minutes if the stock cannot return to the limit price with in 15 seconds. During this 15 second period the stock will be subject to a limit state of limit up or limit down. If no trades take place at or inside the limit price the 5 minute trading pause will occur. Once fully implemented the LULD is intended to replace the single stock circuit breaker rule. Tier 1 and tier 2 securities will have trading bands of 5 and 10 percent respectively from 9:45 AM – 3:35 PM EST. To accommodate additional price discovery during the opening and closing of the market those bands will be expanded to 10 and 20 percent respectively from 9:30 AM – 9:45AM and from 3:35 PM – 4:00PM. Any aggressive orders placed outside of the price band will be re priced by the NASDAQ system to the price band limit price.”", "id": "wrkw6n", "created_utc": 1660832621.0, "score": 159, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 60, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|just now\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wrkw6n)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wrkw6n)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "First day in the market?", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "How’d you know?", "score": 14, "replies": [{"body": "I was the same way and not too long ago", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "🤣🤣🤣", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Do all you fucks really not know how circuit breakers work?

{"title": "8-18-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Well technically it was a green day for SPY today… but it didn’t really feel like it did it? We put in about one of the smallest overall movement days at $3.11 ive seen in a long time (was less than $3 till power hour) and we had yet another low volume day currently sitting below 50mil total on the day. \n\nUsually low volume would be bullish because that just means there are buyers and means there are no sellers, however, today its tough to really say that the low volume was bullish as most of the day there was not upward momentum. Today felt like a good ole stale mate. The question is… who is going to win? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/csio1numhji91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=36684cbda5832d6dd84bf19ed474674ebe1403d3\n\nLooking at the daily you can see that we had a pretty good bounce this morning directly off the red bull rising wedge support line. I had suspect a bounce there would be a great call opportunity and it sure was. Tomorrow SPY bulls will once again be forced to defend that support line. \n\nYou can see what has happened the last few times we have bounced off this support line, however, I will say this time feels and looks much different. \n\nSPY actually closed out its third doji in a row today. Gravestone doji to gravestone doji to dragonfly doji. \n\nSo the question is where do we go from here? \n\nSo tomorrow is monthly OPEX which always brings added volatility to SPY due to profit taking and rolling of options. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oik15xhnhji91.png?width=628&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e20fc3b9fc5e577144d7431a3c58d3f8ea66d43\n\nHere are the STATS for tomorrow. As you can see there is a fuck ton of OI on puts for tomorrow… dang near 3x that of calls. And almost every single one of those puts are worthless as a poopy flavored lollipop. So what does that mean for SPY? I think we are going to see a bigger sell off tomorrow. While we don’t usually touch actual MAX pain and there would be very little argument to suspect we will have a $16 drop haha. \n\nBut I am suspect for us to break through this red 9 week long bull support tomorrow. Which is going to set us up perfectly for the “top” being in. My plan for the last week or two has been to wait till tomorrow night to open some 30dte ATM puts and I am very close. However, If we do not break that red support line I will NOT be opening puts. \n\nKey support-\n\n428 (red bull channel support) -> 425.8\n\nKey resistance-\n\n427 (this is the black downward 3 day long resistance) -> 427.9 -> 429.7 (level resistance) -> 430.9 (bear market resistance) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/klgboj6ohji91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac119de62179de160ba633165aef03b51e619276\n\nFutures daily showing us still in the said rising wedge and we have still failed to even touch bear market resistance line…\n\nSupport- \n\n4277 -> 4256 (red bull support) \n\nResistance-\n\n4310 -> 4328 (bear market resistance) \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3tydjhsohji91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb525e6637ebb9795ddc5102707613a5746bfeb8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m4wi3scphji91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=31716fe3d2daa183737d08af1a18f09d566b35dc\n\nAs I have mentioned I am watching this weekly candle closely to see how it finishes out tomorrow. If we close with a hammer and/or doji candle then I am 100% in puts. However, if they poke this candle tomorrow through that weekly resistance like of 423.5/ 4338 then I am going to hold off on puts. There is a VERY real scenario where we COULD see 460 by the September FOMC at the end of the month. I am still not counting that scenario out and as much as I would love nothing more then to be in some juicy puts right now… I cant and wont be early like burry… \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/om65d04qhji91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=20ba8070bda0e1fcec3bb7df87b5ee0fcf0b2896\n\nI would dare say that Apple is looking weak cause its not… however, I would dare say its slowed its abnormally fast ascent to ATH. Apple is currently about $6 from ATH and exactly 4.8% from ATH at market close today. \n\nWhich is pretty crazy considering SPY is still about 14% from ATH but that’s to be expected when Apples been the golden child. \n\nKey thing I watched happen again today is that Apple attempted to break through and close over 175.5, however, they did not do it. They failed once again and failed to close the candle body over that line. That is showing weakness. With a doji on the daily today I am expecting some sort of retracement tomorrow out of Apple. \n\nKey support to watch is 173.3. If we break that we are breaking the 3 week long support line if we fall through that level. That would only leave the 9 week long (10 week by time they get to it) support closer to 170 for Monday. \n\nKey resistance remains at 175.5 tomorrow. \n\nSo as I mentioned I REALLY am close to thinking the top is in and that we are going to see the top within he next week. My ideal case tomorrow to be able to open puts EOD (this will be after 4pm market close) is…. 1. SPY closing the daily candle under 424.7. 2. Apple closes its candle under 173.3 and closer to 172.1 if not below and finally 3. The VIX must break through its almost 3 month long resistance line at 20.5 tomorrow. \n\nIf I see all three of these key things tomorrow then I will feel comfortable entering puts ATM 30dte. However, IF any of the three are not met then I will wait and re-evaluate Monday. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nAs much as I hate to upset the apes…. I did a bad thing today… I played a put on the beloved. She was small and less than fulfilling but she did reward me a neato 50% profits. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uic04atqhji91.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=27733fa5b882039ec882c26ac322afe397b0a764\n\nI am not quite sure what it is about Thursdays but they continue to be my kryptonite. The one positive thing about today was that unlike the past I did mitigate my losses. I didn’t let a loser (even though both of those plays I had strong confidence in them) turn into bigger losers. I was mechanical and for me that was a big win. \n\nThe first put I loss on was a great play but I entered too early and my stop got hit before I could allow it to play out. The call I got stopped out on I am not quite sure what happened but it was up about 5% and I tried 3 different times and it even hit 3 different times at the 5% premium target but it wouldn’t fill and then it ripped against me. Overall it has been a good week for me. I am still green on the week and I look forward to tomorrow trading and closing out the week green. \n\nYoutube will be up later.", "id": "wrvaug", "created_utc": 1660857908.0, "score": 29,
