{"title": "Unpopular opinion: oil prices will stay high until oil stocks go up", "selftext": "In a normal commodity cycle, the cure for high prices is high prices. However, that is no longer the case, and I will explain why I think that is the case. I will try to list sources where I can but a lot of this information has been synthesized over time and therefore you will just have to google some things. Even the sources I find will be articles I find on google to support my statements.\n\nHigh prices do not necessarily create permanent demand destruction. Even in the worst parts of the 2008 recession, oil demand barely dropped. Not to mention that demand can recover and if the fed pivots, it can be quite inflationary at least for commodity prices where physical markets are tight.\n\nHere is an article of which I only want to highlight a single sentence (but I figure I should include a source). \n\nhttps://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/oil-demand-price-coronavirus-world-bank/\n\n“In 2008, the Great Recession led to demand falling by 0.66%”\n\nThat is nothing! But supply had already grown too much from the shale boom, leading to a supply/demand balance that favored the buyer. Compared to today, however, as the bottom half of the world is lifted out of poverty, they will consume more oil. They will go from bikes to motorcycles and motorcycles to cars. Let’s be real: they aren’t getting EVs anytime soon.\n\nFurthermore,  as europe heads into an energy crisis and Russian gas is no longer an option due to nordstream explosions (only one pipeline left but it’s way smaller capacity than before), they will need to burn more oil and coal. This could lead to a lot of gas to oil switching https://bisoninterests.com/content/f/gas-to-oil-switching-–-winter-is-coming\n\nI DONT WANT to hear any poorly framed arguments about european storage being full or TTF going negative. It doesn’t matter. Here is why anyone that tells you that europe will be fine with their storage doesn’t know what they are talking about: If you are driving cross country and start with a full tank that can get you 20% of the way there (being generous here), does that mean you can automatically make it coast to coast? No. You have to gas up. Likewise, getting through winter is the same. Gas storage cannot account for the entire winter. They need constant inflows. Heating oil, diesel and coal are just LNG without the infrastructure and therefore Europe will go for those next.\n\nThat being said, demand is ultimately very difficult to pin down. What I would like to focus on is supply.\n\nBiden often complains about oil companies doing buybacks and dividends. Why? Because at these prices, dividends and buybacks get shareholders better return than growth at these multiples. Why are multiples low? Because institutions have shunned fossil fuel companies too long and Yellen and Granholm have also told development banks to tighten lending conditions to oil companies. \n\nDivestment examples:\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-new-york-pension-fund-divest-half-its-shale-companies-2022-02-09/\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-norway-swf-oil/norway-sovereign-wealth-fund-to-divest-oil-explorers-keep-refiners-idUSKBN1WG4R9\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/2021/09/10/1035901596/harvard-university-end-investment-fossil-fuel-industry-climate-change-activism\n\nYellen and fossil fuel lending:\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-11/yellen-targets-curbs-on-development-bank-support-for-fossil-fuel#xj4y7vzkg\n\n\nBesides that, analysts will say “shareholders want buybacks and dividends over growth.” It’s becoming a tired phrase. Who are shareholders here? Greedy people like me who want gains and don’t want to have them produce more without me making any more money, and etf and fund managers like blackrock and vanguard who only are custodians of the shares but get all the voting power. Guess what? Not only are they greedy too, but they also want to choke oil. Consequently, the sector globally is in liquidation. According to Rick Rule (who I trust a lot), the oil industry is $1b/day underinvested in sustaining current output. Furthermore, if, for example, Brent is at $110 and oil stocks price in $60, am I going to want to risk oversupply? No! Because I would be terrified about what share price would do if it priced in $60 at $110 and then the price actually dropped down to $60. What would it price in then? $20 at $60? $10? Negative?\n\nOPEC also cannot ramp up production anytime soon. And why would they? \n\nhttps://time.com/6219783/opec-large-production-cut/\n\nThey want $90+ oil\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/macron-tells-biden-that-uea-saudi-can-barely-raise-oil-output-2022-06-27/\n\nThey can’t. Only Russia could have, but they needed western OFS, which all left the country, so their production will actually fall. \n\nWe must rely on western oil companies.\n\nUnpopular take: oil prices will remain heightened and volatile and spikes will persist until oil stocks go up. The cure to high prices is no longer high prices. It’s high oil stock prices. They are stupid cheap, and until they trade at reasonable multiples, shareholders and etf managers like blackrock and vanguard will not let them do anything but dividends and buybacks.  And that is great for CEOs and boards. No need to make hard choices. No need to take risks. Just say those two magic words, so of course they will choose the easy way.\n\ntl;dr\nShareholders will only allow significant new production when stocks go up. Till then, buybacks and dividends.\nIf they are not making gains somehow, what the hell are they holding high torque cyclical stocks for? So stop throwing money into the bottomless hole that is tech. XOM just hit ATH. you will never make as much money as the guy you heard about it from, but there is room to run. If you are afraid of being late, late cycle OFS hasn’t outperformed yet. It’s a bull market.\n\n\nedit: Regarding XOM being at ATH: No cause of concern yet. there are small caps cash flowing their market cap out there. I would buy those. But as for XOM, XOM/SPX chart shows we have a long way to go till overvaluation https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=XOM%2FSPX\n\nATH tells you one thing. inflation adjusted high says another. reinclusion into SPX will tell you another (people will frontrun that). Ratio chart is the most useful imo. For XOM/SPX and also XOP/oil ratio.

Oil companies are tired of getting burnt holding a bag after huge capex projects come online with oil prices down 50+% from when the project was started.

They have great fundamental businesses, large moats, and are very innovative. When the economy picks back up they should as well. Same logic applies to Apple except I think it is not quite as good a value at these levels and a little riskier. Also not sure if the 30% cut on app purchases is sustainable and good chance it could be subject to a legal threat.\n\nTier 2 (Medium Risk/High Reward): META is by far the most attractively priced stock of this group. Its P/E ratio is about 9. Even if it doesn't ever retrace to its former heights and growth flatlines there is still value to be unlocked at these levels. But, if you trust Zuckerberg and his metaverse bet pays off, META could easily be a multi-trillion dollar company. Only FAANG company with the potential for exponential growth I think. On the other hand if the Metaverse turns into Zuckerberg's white whale it is possible to see him literally betting the company on it and losing. I think META is the only FAANG company I would not be shocked to see bankrupt over the next five years.\n\nTier 3 (Medium Risk/Low Reward): Netflix's biggest problem is it has no moat. It has gone from being the place to stream movies and tv to just one of the many options available. Netflix has a lot of original content, but it is expensive doesn't really stand out when compared with the offerings of HBO Max, Prime, and Disney Plus. So I am not sure what the growth story will be here. The ad tier and crackdown on password sharing give the potential for some short term upside, but in the long run I just think they continue to fade into one streaming service among an ever growing number of options.\n\nNote: I have zero expertise and this is not investment advice, blah, blah, blah.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for the response!  \nI think I want to buy google, hold my meta with faith, and I'll do a bit of research on netflix - although I don't even know if people like it anymore.

However, if you want serious 2x+ gains from META, youre #1. Trusting in the Zuck and 2. looking at 4+ years of waiting for his plan to come to light.\n\nSaying META is \"done\" tho is pretty stupid hahaha. I mean, META is both FB and IG. The boomers will keep FB alive for another decade at least; and IG is not going anywhere.\n\nThe odds of FB and IG just disappearing is basically 0.\n\nIn my opinion, META will recover 30-50% of its \"post-META reveal\" value in a year to a year and a half, settling around $130.\n\nBut I think saying META is done is batshit insane and pretty ignorant.\n\nMETA has declined a lot because Zuck has tunnel vision on his META project which doesnt promise serious profits for several years, but FB and IG arent failing businesses. Theyre just not promising huge growth. This upsets investors because, investors want huge growth.\n\nZucks plan is to have 3-5x huge growth thru his META project. IF this comes to light, its a half decade away. I personally think his META project WILL end up being a success, because of how much hes investing into it. He has willingly lost over $100B in net worth, and is NOT changing course. IMO that tells me that he has some serious shit up his sleeve. However, regardless, FB and IG are not going anywhere.\n\nInvest in TTCF tho.
