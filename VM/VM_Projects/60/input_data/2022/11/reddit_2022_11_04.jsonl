The only thing that is up year-to-date is the dollar and commodities. That's it. And the only thing that is up since the Fed started going to 75s \\[basis point rate hikes\\] is the dollar,\" Gundlach explained.\n\nNot only are stocks down big so far this year, but bonds are too thanks to the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes.\n\n So most investors, whether they own stocks or bonds, should have plenty of opportunities to harvest losses between now and the end of the year. And that means there will be more selling pressure ahead.\n\n\"There will be pretty high tax loss selling I would think. I even got a white paper from somebody saying this was the greatest tax loss selling opportunity of a generation. I would say it might be two generations,\" Gundlach said.\n\nTax-loss selling is a tax optimization strategy that investors and financial advisors often take advantage of in taxable accounts heading into year-end. The strategy involves realizing losses by selling out of losing positions, and then buying back those portfolio positions 31 days later to avoid the tax wash-sale rule.\n\nThe strategy allows investors to realize losses that can offset future realized gains, ultimately helping reduce tax liabilities in the long term.\n\nWith some widely held stocks like Meta Platforms and Amazon down big year-to-date, investors may be waiting until after the tax-loss harvesting period ends at the start of next year before rushing in to buy.\n\nIn the meantime, Gundlach recommends investors stick with bonds as they offer a better value relative to stocks thanks to the rise in interest rates.", "id": "ym2mgm", "created_utc": 1667577301.0, "score": 142, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 64, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 106, "replies": [{"body": "So we buy now?", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "Have cash ready, have your picks ready.

With the exception of selling puts on PARA through earnings I've been happy with all the trades so far. Setting a 50% profit exit executed a few times already at only 6 days in the position. I calculate the projected annual yield per trade and even my very unexciting position in T would result in a 50% YOY profit. Of course that's being obliterated in the short term by my mistake with PARA, but ultimately we're only talking about $200 in either direction on a $6k balance.\n\nI started with a .15 Delta on F because that was 1-sigma OTM, but since everyone seems to love .30 Delta I switched to that. I'm probably going to dial back to maybe ~.20 to split the difference since it's a bear market and it makes sense to be a little more conservative in these market conditions. I've done a lot of research on bear markets and generally speaking they don't bottom out until there's a strong signal for a reversal of conditions, which I haven't seen yet. Plus bear markets on average wipe out 40% of the value of the S&P, and we're only half way there.\n\nWith all that said, as others have said: don't get greedy. Focusing on consistent small wins will add up exponentially over time, which means big gains always come at the end. Starting young means you will have a long time to perfect your strategy.\n\nAlso: don't pay for advice or training outside of accredited schools (books are another story and often worth the $15-$30 they cost).

One of my T positions closed on Wednesday before the Fed meeting on that little bump that happened before the following dip. The profit exit perfectly timed the market in that case, and I was able to open up a new position immediately thereafter.\n\nAlso, since the value of an option is asymptotic to zero, the closer you have a profit exit set towards 100%, the greater the likelihood you will have to exit at expiration. Using a 50% exit is a good at splitting the difference between taking wins quickly and letting theta do it's thing. In essence the 50% exit is a good way to catch Vega or Delta moving in your favor, without being 100% reliant on Theta.\n\nIn other words: it cashes out winning trades faster, thus freeing up your money to execute another trade, thus raising the projected annual yield. It also offers an off-ramp for trades that might be in trouble, rather than keeping money tied up in a loser.
