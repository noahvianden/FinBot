I get why people a nervous about owning INTC, but I think the rewards with INTC far outweigh the risks.\n\nNVDA is extremely expensive and I hate owning it for that reason, but it's a great company and gives me exposure to a lot of stuff I like.

If any of these crucial parts fail the pressure on their margins will make the stock significantly less cheap.\n\nLong term growth isn't evident (but likely). Their high price is mainly driven by management execution and the expectation they will capture a large chunk of AI and server market.

Also indirect effects are significant: if China targets ASML, which isn't unthinkable because they don't sell their top products to China, they can target products made using ASML technologies or stimulate ASML customers to switch to Chinese suppliers at a discounted rate. The main fear arises from ASMLs strong tech position and their 'support' of Taiwan, two reasons China might feel obliged to target them.\n\nIntel in fact isn't loosing on design.

As a side note, there is basically no theta decay in this situation.\n\nWide spreads move together but at a much slower rate due to the difference in delta.  I.e., Tesla 800/600.  If Tesla goes down a bit, the 800P changes in value much quicker than the 600P because the delta between them may be .15.\n\nThe long leg was great at the start because it reduced the cost of the trade (like the OP said ) but you have to drag this along with you as you roll.  This will get more and more expensive as the delta gets higher.  It eventually gets to the point that they move so close together that you cannot roll out to any date without costing a fortune (basically max loss).\n\nOne way to \"fix\" this is to increase the width of the legs.  Why?  It increases the delta between them which means it is cheaper to buy the second leg again.\n\nThis is one reason why naked options are so attractive.
