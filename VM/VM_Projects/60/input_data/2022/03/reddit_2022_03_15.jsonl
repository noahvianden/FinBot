If issuers decides to halt the purchase/redemption of creation units, the etf will still go out of wack, this time with no option of accelerated maturity. Think about RSX etf.

Small enough congress doesn't know about it.  If they did, they'd ban them.\n\nAlso, fun fact: ETNs are highly regulated in European markets, so buying an ETN on the London stock exchange, for example, is going to be fine.  They're regulated so tightly they might as well be an ETF.  But in EU countries ETFs have tighter regulations than in the US which is where the terminology differs.\n\n---\n\nSo you know a bucket shop is what we call today a broker.
