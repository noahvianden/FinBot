This is a significant assembly expense and a primary bottleneck to production throughput.\n- By using their new patented wire harness, Tesla will:\n - reduce the cost of goods due to fewer wire mass required, and they can also be installed by robots\n - increase wiring redundancy, which makes the car more fault tolerant and more crash safe\n - service should get simpler as well: debugging a sporadic electrical fault in a 4km wire harness is one of the nightmare jobs of car electricians\n- The new wiring harness makes the vehicle platform more extensible as well :\n - with the traditional star topology approach new wires have to be run to new components, which has a physical effect on all assembly steps where the new wire runs, which all has to be re-validated and they might also run out of physical space due to the many duplicated layers of insulating taking up a lot of wire ducting cross section area.\n - with the new hierarchical bus topology with communications links overlaid on it then new sensors or higher power draw or new communication links can be used from reserves designed into the car early on.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "4 km is 1.767330888e+06 potrzebie\n\n^^^[WHY](/r/UselessConversionBot/comments/1knas0/hi_im_useless/)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Living up to your name.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "This is the most fun company to follow.

With a 97k cars production plus around 30k from china( assuming they hit 3k per week), that puts them close to 130k.   \nThey will be shooting themselves in the foot if they release it early. Specially if they can’t match production they will just have a huge backlog of model y from people waiting to come out.   \nOn top of that Elon already forecast a bad Q1 2020.
