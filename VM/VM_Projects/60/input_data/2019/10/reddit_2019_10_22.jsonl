What fundamentally determines the value of the stock is it's discounted future cash flow (basically how much money the company will make in the long run, discounted because money received in the future is worth less than money received now). Investors want to maximize the value of their stock, so they want to maximize the value of the discounted future cash flow. Sure, there is some immediacy bias as future earnings are discounted, but fundamentally the company **needs** to have a sustainable business model.\n\nThe group that **does** care only about the short term is upper management. Those guys get huge bonuses for good financial years, or even just good quarters, and are not likely to work at a single company long enough for the long term to matter as much. Furthermore they will be wealthy enough after just a few years that the long term of the company might not even matter at all to them.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Texts were made available to DOJ in Feb.
