For their stock valuation to make sense, you need to be seeing massive YoY growth.  Right now, wait times are lower than they were a year ago for markets where they were already established.  That doesn't indicate that there are say, tens of thousands of Americans waiting to buy a Model 3.  Those who want them, have them or can get them pretty easily.  That's not indicative of a hyper growth state you would need to justify its valuation today.\n\nSecond, Tesla's current numbers are based on new markets they've been introduced to.  So what happens in a year or 2 after the initial demand is met?  What's the company's strategy to convert long time ICE drivers, or people who are borderline on EVs?  \n\nThird, Tesla is either unwilling or doesn't have the resources to do what pretty much every other company in the world would do to help it reach new buyers, advertise.

So is Tesla demand so strong that they could sell 10 to 20 times more cars today?  I'm going to say no.  That's what their valuation suggests.  \n\nSecond, while people are aware Tesla is a thing today, that's typically the first phase of branding.  Marketing 101 looks at a lot more than just being aware of something.  There's still knowledge, preference and purchase.  That's why truck companies advertise things like \"best in class towing\".  So for example, does your typical luxury car buyer know that the Tesla Model S 100D with Ludicrous Mode is the fastest fucking production car in the world today?  Does the average person spending 40K on a new car know that a model 3 has a range that meets their needs for 99% of their days.

There have been discussions that Tesla deliveries were lower than expected in the first part of the third quarter - reconfiguration of part of the Fremont factory could have contributed to such a drop, while enabling increased production toward the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter.\n\nIt's also worth noting that Tesla knows more about actual demand than any of the analysts do, and undertaking a significant effort to increase productive capacity appears to be more consistent with an expectation of increasing demand than an expectation of decreasing demand.\n\nThe actual reported numbers and a comment on increased order backlog supports a view of high demand, at least for Model 3 (perhaps to be partially supplanted by Model Y in the future). \n\nModel 3 is currently the primary driver of increased production.

An example setup would be last December 24th. Sell a put credit spread ITM for the EOM Jan, Feb, March, etc (depending on where you think the market would rise to). \n\nWhen the market tanks like that(dec 2018) and is going to rebound, an arbitrage credit spread is perfect since there is not much risk.  Even if one were to risk $500 to return 5k on setups like these, you would make an insane amount on money but it would also require ‘patience’ for drops like this in the market.
