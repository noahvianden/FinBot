I thought that the stock price was going to soar the next day.\n\nAfter watching carefully Sandy Munro comments about the model 3, and many, many youtube videos about Tesla technology, I decided to invest all of my \"disposable\" savings on TSLA. Now, I wish I had more confidence on my investment analysis and invested more.\n\nMy take on Tesla: M3 is a hit, MY will be also a hit next year, Cybertruck's big time will come a year later. Powerpack, megapack and virtual power will grow exponentially, China GF will be a cash cow. Tesla will be the first to manufacture solid-state battery and solar roof, to develop full self-driving and deploy robo-taxis.\n\nI am not worried on the timeline, 2, 3, 5, 10 years.

This is very important in order to truly benefit from the opportunity: If your target is 4000$ you can still make 11.4x today but it would have been 20x if you had the good idea to buy a few months ago at 200$. And if you wait too much and buy at 500$ it will be just 8x, 8x will be reached much more easily at 1600$ by those who invested at 200$. So again, it’s important to invest at low prices. I consider 350$ is still an excellent price.\nAll this requires patience to wait for the expected benefits to come to fruition, patience solidified by a strong conviction in the investment thesis, conviction built by spending a significant amount of time studying  the pros and cons of the considered opportunity.\nFor me the recent big milestone which validated that shorts should ultimately loose for good, and that their probable plan to destroy share price by trying to instill fear in potential new customers was failing, was when Tesla raised a couple of billions as a safety cushion in a matter of hours. That plus the recent increase of Free cash flow was putting Tesla on the safe side.\nThat triggered for me the green light to go big, because yes, once you have identified such an opportunity AND when risk/reward is heavily asymmetrical in a good way, the second key is to invest as much capital you can afford of having such capital being “locked” for many years until it produces the desired return.\nHeavy diversification is for those who don’t really know in what they invest, so go big in safely considered opportunity you honestly believe in. And prepare yourself for bad things to happen too.\nLast point: all parameters considered, it is realistic to think Tesla share price will  seriously take off in the next couple of years.\nThis is no investment advice in Tesla, you have to build your conviction yourself, that is my only advice.\nGLTA.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "As long as you have a high pain threshold and long term confidence in Tesla, go for it.
