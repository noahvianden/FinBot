{"title": "Introduction", "selftext": "Hello everyone, fellow options trader here. A little background about my trading method.\n\nI use a trade ribbon of 3 exponential moving averages: 8, 13, 21, color coordinated as green, yellow, red.\n\nThe reason for the color code is like a warning system, for the most part the stocks that I trade are highly liquid and they tend to ride the 8 EMA, if price action moves to the 13 ema (yellow), that's my signal to watch the position more closely, make sure I have a stop nearby ready to execute. If price action moves to the 21 ema (red), I should really consider being out of this trade, that's like the last line of defense, and if I choose to ignore it, well I'm stupid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo if the trend is bullish, I'm looking for a setup laid out like price action>8 ema>13 ema>21 ema\n\nIf the trend is bearish, I'm looking for a setup laid out like 21 ema>13 ema>8 ema>price action\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf price action is between these moving averages, and/or the ema's are not lined up properly it's not a optimal trade entry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe length of time I will stay in a position is based around the VIX, when we are above 15-16 I'll transition to minutes charts, and when VIX is below I enter positions at least 45 days to expiration, which plan on being out of that contract when there are 21 days remaining, if the trend is still intact at this time, I'll enter a new contract 45+ days out, rinse and repeat.\n\nThe instruments that I trade using this method are: AAPL, BABA, FB, NFLX, SPY, and /ZS. I don't deviate from my trades, so  if I see posts in regards to those, I'll probably be there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Added Photo of Study from ToS\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rlo914i9lyh21.jpg?width=1915&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df08b0608dfb092a5f35f03c218b7afb067180c3", "id": "asyy7m", "created_utc": 1550724724.0, "score": 36, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 54, "comments": [{"body": "Do you know that the VIX is only related to the S&P 500?
