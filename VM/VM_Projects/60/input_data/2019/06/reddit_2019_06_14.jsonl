Each company will be investing $10 million into the project. Yahoo Finance’s Alexis Christoforous, Brian Sozzi, and Dan Howley break down what this means for digital payments, and Cameron Chell, chair and co-founder of ICOx Innovations, joins Sozzi and Christoforous to discuss Facebook’s stablecoin.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI recommend start watching at 3:20.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think this is a very smart move for FB. A stablecoin could be used for purchases on Facebook. Although I think its true value is sending money between friends. Imagine having a \"send money\" option on WhatsApp, Instagram and/or Messanger.  For me, having a simple solution for something like dividing costs after organising a dinner would be amazing. I know there are apps for this, but it's unlikely everyone is going to have that app, having the option on FB or WhatsApp could be a real game changer.  \nI'm definitively long on FB.
