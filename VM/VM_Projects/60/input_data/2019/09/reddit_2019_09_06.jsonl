We don't know - US sales in August were way down YoY.  \n\n> Think about this question, how many people understand that the base Model 3 is cheaper to own than most of the Camry trims? Very few, even among Tesla investors.\n\nVery few since that is nonsense.  Remember, you can get a new Camry that gets 50 mpg for ~$26k.  If you drive 15k miles per year and pay the average US price of gasoline of $2.50, your annual gas bill is ~$750.  Total estimated cost of repairs and maintenance on a Camry for 5 years is about $3,200 per Edmunds.  So five years of ownership (not including insurance, which is more expensive for a Tesla) will be about $33k.  Base Tesla off the website is already significantly higher than that without taking into account running costs.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "For the first point, right now the Model 3 SR+ is $39k, AWD $48k. How many people go to order this car thinking I can save $1.8k on tax. I think at this point, people order the car because they like the car, not because they care a lot about the $1.8k. Similarly the $1.8k incentives going away will not make a big difference to demand. At this point almost all the orders are from new people, the reservation list has long gone for the US. Even in Q2 only 10% of US orders were from reservations.\n\nFor Camry, it's EPA fuel efficiency is 34 mpg, The fuel cost is $5514 for 5 years. (A lot of people live in CA, for them the 5 year fuel cost would be $8161). According to Edmund, for the seven Camry trims, the true cost to own for 5 years are as following: $42k, 48k, 49k, 37k, 43k, 36k, 35k (Options cost are not included).\n\nFor Model 3, Kelley Blue Book projects a resale value of 48.7% at 60 months. Bluebook doesn't have TCO for Model 3. But here is the estimates from Loup Ventures, which I checked and agree with: Purchase price 39k, financing 2.7k, Tax, title, license 3k, Insurance 5.7k, Electricity 2.3k, Maintenance/repairs 1.2k, resale 18.9k, Total $34.8k.\n\nFrom the above we can see Model 3's 5 year \"true cost to own\" is lower than all Camry trims. Saving varies from $500 to $14,000. \n\nAnother point to consider, this Model 3 SR+ includes the following features for free: autopilot; top safety; Tinted glass roof with ultraviolet and infrared protection, phone for entry and start, free OTA updates with great new features coming every few weeks, silky smooth acceleration 0~60 mph in 5.3 seconds; 18\" wheels; 12-way power adjustable heated seats; Premium seat material and trim; amazing audio system; Custom driver profiles; large screen with real-time may and navigation; automatically open and close garage door, games mode, dog mode, active safety features......\n\nModel 3 is cheaper to own, but it's vastly better than the Camry. Most people understand the second part, but very few people understand the first part.\n\nModel 3 is not a stand still product, it will get a lot better in the next year or two. It's cost might go lower due to scale. It's cost in China for sure will go down a lot in a few months.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "For the first point, the company clearly felt the drop in tax incentives would hurt sales, otherwise they would not have dropped prices again.  Your view is directly at odds with the company.\n\nYour Camry comparison is all wrong.  I don't even know where to begin.  First, I pointed out you can get a Camry with an EPA fuel efficiency over 50 mpg.  The fuel cost for 5 years is more like $3,750 than $5,500.  Edmund's puts the true cost to own at $32,406 ([source](https://www.edmunds.com/toyota/camry-hybrid/2019/cost-to-own/)).  \n\nYour source for the Model 3 true cost to own is a venture capital firm with a huge investment in Tesla.  I'm sure their calculation isn't biased at all.  Case in point, their financing cost is $1,700 lower than what Edmunds used for the Camry, despite the Camry having a purchase price of $28k instead of $39k.  Hmmm, that totally makes sense....\n\nAt any rate, true cost to own for the Camry is still lower than the Model 3 even using your biased numbers.  \n\nLooking at other Camry trims is also incredibly dishonest unless you also want to look at the true cost of ownership of the other trims of the Model 3.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Do you agree Model 3 SR+ is better than all Camry trims, in terms of performance, driving fun, and features?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "In terms of performance and driving fun, definitely (though the top speed of the Camry is higher than the SR+).
