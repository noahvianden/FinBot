(even so Tesla is planning to reduce the usual end of quarter spike).  \n\n\nIn comparison the January 2019 figures (also first month of the quarter):  \nTesla 10,3k / Model 3: 7,3k / Model S&X: 3k  \n\n\nApril 19 vs. January 2019:  \nTesla + 13,7k (+133%) / Model 3: +11,8k (+162%) / Model S&X: +1,9k (+63%) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPretty solid start in Q2, partly due to higher vehicles in transit. \n\nIf May and June sales increase by 6,5k each compared to Feb & March, guidance (90k) is achieved.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrom my understanding, the EV-salesblog is mainly based on governmental data and partly on estimates (e.g. for the US it should be the estimates from InsideEV). Therefore, the figures should be quite accurate.  \n\n\nLinks:  \n[EV Sales: Global Top 5 - Mid Game bet - April 2019](http://ev-sales.blogspot.com/2019/05/global-top-5-mid-game-bet-april-2019.html)  \n[EV Sales: Global Top 20 - March 2019](http://ev-sales.blogspot.com/2019/04/global-top-20-march-2019.html)  \n[EV Sales: Global Top 20 - January 2019](http://ev-sales.blogspot.com/2019/02/global-top-20-january-2019.html)", "id": "bqfdkz", "created_utc": 1558261182.0, "score": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 64, "comments": [{"body": "This would be amazing news, I hope it's true", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "If they've delivered 150k by end of Q2 (that's Q1 + Q2), they would need to do another 210k to meet their minimum guidance.
