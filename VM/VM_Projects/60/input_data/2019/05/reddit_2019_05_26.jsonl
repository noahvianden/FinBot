{"title": "The Nifty Fifty- a history of sure things", "selftext": "Gather round the fire, children and let me tell you a tale. In a previous thread from today, some of you asked what the Nifty Fifty and are apparently too lazy to use google, so I wanted to regale you with its history. The Nifty Fifty was a group of high growth stock such as McDonald’s, Disney, Polaroid, Xerox, and 46 others that existed during the 1960’s and early 1970’s. These were the original FANG names that had new technology such as copiers, drive through windows, franchise business models, and cameras that developed film instantly. Competition couldn’t touch them. They were the Golden Geese and anyone who didn’t own them were basically idiots... \n\nThey benefitted from secular AND cyclical growth trends in the United States and were growing earnings by 20-30% per year. Every money manager that tried to outperform it got crushed and many of those mutual funds that underperformed went out of business. As the Nifty Fifty became more of a sure bet, more and more professionals and individuals entrusted their money to the Nifty Fifty. This led to multiples in the 50-70x range for earnings. But people didn’t care- they had outperformed for years and growth seemed limitless! why would they stop now?\n\nEventually, the party was over in the 1970’s and the Nifty Fifty got crushed to the tune of 70-80%. Sometimes it was earnings slowing down, sometimes just multiple compression, other times inflation just ripped everyone to shreds, sometimes new technology came around that made them obsolete. Some went bankrupt. \n\nI’m not sure what the lesson is here. Maybe it is there is no such thing as a sure thing? I don’t know if the QQQ or SPY or FANG is a similar bubble or not- but I just like the story and thought you guys would like it too.", "id": "btcefj", "created_utc": 1558900635.0, "score": 314, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 60, "comments": [{"body": "I thought I saw somewhere that ultimately Nifty Fifty did pretty well even if you bought near the peak(and held for long enough). \n\nIn any case we're looking at 20x earnings for GOOG or 27x for FB, so seems a little different.

These fifty stocks are credited by historians with propelling the bull market of the early 1970s, while their subsequent crash and underperformance through the early 1980s are an example of what may occur following a period during which many investors, influenced by a positive market sentiment, ignore fundamental stock valuation metrics. Most have since recovered and are solid performers, although a few are now defunct or otherwise worthless. \n\nIn India, the term NIFTY 50 refers to the diversified stock index of the National stock exchange, consisting of 50 stocks that represent 12 sectors of the Indian economy.\n\n***\n\n^[ [^PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=kittens_from_space) ^| [^Exclude ^me](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=WikiTextBot&message=Excludeme&subject=Excludeme) ^| [^Exclude ^from ^subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/banned) ^| [^FAQ ^/ ^Information](https://np.reddit.com/r/WikiTextBot/wiki/index) ^| [^Source](https://github.com/kittenswolf/WikiTextBot)   ^]\n^Downvote ^to ^remove ^| ^v0.28", "score": 10, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Nicely done!", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "As an Indian autist, I’m really proud you guys are mentioning my preferred vehicle for autistic artistry. 🙏🏻 namaste motherfuckers", "score": -2, "replies": []}]}
