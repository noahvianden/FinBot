Because the economy was bad, and they thought they could find better paying jobs in the US, which they could use to send money back home to support their families.\n\n    In the last decade or so, Mexico has become much more stable, and their economy has been doing well, so we have fewer and fewer Mexican immigrants. Most migrants now come from places like El Salvador, Guatemala, and other Mesoamerican countries, because they're fleeing violence from cartels, gangs, and rebel groups. And, additionally, there's a very good reason we don't arrest all of those migrants: they're seeking asylum, and the US has a policy of *not turning away innocent people who are facing violent, bloody death*. \n\n   Additionally, many aspects of the US economy rely on the labour migrants provide. We don't have many native born people who are willing to work hard, low wage jobs in the fields, and our population is aging at an increasing rate. We need new people to overcome the gap in labour we'll be experiencing as more and more Boomers hit retirement age. Immigrants especially have proven to be a good source of new labour. They're good citizens: they pay their taxes, first gen migrants are less likely to commit crimes, etc. Think about it: these people have gone through hell *just to be in America*. They've crossed through dangerous territory (both politically and environmentally dangerous) just so that they can seek a better life in our country. They exemplify the American Dream, they make us a better nation, and we should be welcoming them with open arms, not putting them in cages.\n\n    Long story short, using tariffs to wreck the Mexican economy won't slow immigration; it'll destabilize Mexico, cause unnecessary human suffering, increase the number of people seeking a better wage in the US, all while worsening the US economy.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/over-1000-illegal-immigrants-apprehended-on-us-mexico-border-largest-group-ever-apprehended-at-single-time-sources-say\n\nOnly the leftists who are pushing for open borders in order to import votes would not call this an invasion.\n\nImporting tens of millions of low skill, low Is, low educated, impoverished people into a country during a time of technological revolution that is seeing the jobs that low skilled, low IQ, and low educated people being replaced, while at the same time pushing to expand social entitlement spending on this mass of people is the epitome of retarded.\n\n“But but but they pay taxes....!!”\n\nMost illegals either commit identity theft and steal a social security number to pay federal income taxes, or they commit felony tax evasion and don’t pay it at all.\n\nMeanwhile the 20 to thirty million illegals already here cost the taxpayers over a hundred BILLION dollars each year.\n\nBTW.... obvious brigading is obvious.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}
