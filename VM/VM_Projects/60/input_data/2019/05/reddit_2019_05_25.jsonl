Long analysis incoming.\n\nFrom a long-term meta perspective, the tariffs should give both the US and China leverage for future negotiations with other parties.  When a other political heads try making trade demands with China, there will be this data point that China has already opposed previous demands and escalated tariffs.  And perhaps pondered escalating further other measures like rare earth restrictions.  Similarly, the US previously made demands and escalated with tariffs of its own.  Threatened Huawei and such.  Thus, other countries should proceed with tremendous caution and not shake the hornet’s nest when negotiating with either of these countries.  Message delivered.\n\nWhat I’m unclear about here is the timeline.  Letting it drag out more seems *better* for them, not worse - as long as it doesn’t severely impact the economy of either country.  The longer it drags the more weight the tactics above carry.\n\nBut from my observation the value erosion in the markets already demonstrate it has impacted *both* economies... so I would not expect either Trump or Xi to let this drag on too much.  \n\nIf the tariffs were applied but then lifted after two weeks, it would just seem like a hollow bluff and I’m not sure people would take future tariff threats as seriously.  Plus, the longer it drags the more Xi and Trump can claim “they won”.  I think being able to claim they won the trade war to their people is almost of the same importance of actually winning the trade war.  And I already think those conditions that allow both to claim they won are there.\n\nTrump: “we finally negotiated a good trade deal with china, all the other presidents before me failed to do this, best economy, markets higher than ever, blah blah blah” much better for him to add this feather to his cap when he hits his campaign trail towards the end of this year. My only issue here is that he kind of needs a “paper win” in the trade war more than Xi.  He has to have some IP protection in the deal, otherwise he might open himself up to criticism.  \n\nXi: I mean, you know he will get the China media to say he won either way.  “We resisted their bullying, we fought back, we negotiated a better deal, our economy will continue to grow the fastest, tariffs lifted.”  I’m not sure how much farther Xi wants to go here - and escalate with Apple threats, or boycotts - stuff that will drag down both economies.\n\nI say I mildly agree because there are definitely joint “best-case” scenarios here, a la game theory, where both make a deal and preserve their dominant economic statuses.  But there are also sub-optimal cases where neither agrees.

{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning May 27th, 2019", "selftext": "Hey what's happening r/wallstreetbets! Good morning and happy Saturday to all of you on this subreddit. I hope everyone made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new holiday-shortened trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 27th, 2019.\n\n# **Trade and the economy have become the new roller coaster for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/24/trade-and-the-economy-have-become-the-new-roller-coaster-for-markets.html)**\n*****\n> Trade headlines could be a big factor for markets in the week ahead, but investors will also be attuned to fresh inflation data and moves in the bond market, which is flashing new worries about the economy.\n*****\n> Stocks were on a roller coaster ride in the past week, as markets reacted to worsening trade tensions and concerns that negotiations could be prolonged, causing pain for the global economy. But the bond market’s move was perhaps even more dramatic, as yields, which move opposite of price, fell to levels last seen in 2017, and the futures market began to price in three Fed interest rate cuts by the end of next year.\n*****\n> “There’s not a lot of economic data next week, so events hang over us,” said Marc Chandler, chief global strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex. “It’s more about the evolution of old issues than new issues, like trade and Brexit.”\n*****\n> Brexit will continue to be a focus in global markets. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May stepped aside Friday after failing to get agreement on a plan for the U.K. to leave the European Union. Chandler said investors will be watching the jockeying among candidates hoping to succeed Prime Minister May, with hard line Brexit proponent Boris Johnson expected to seek the job, among others.\n*****\n> As for trade, Chandler said it’s possible that President Donald Trump’s comments that Huawei could be part of a trade deal may be the start of a new approach by the administration to tone down its rhetoric. The telecom giant has been blacklisted by the U.S. and is expected to be denied access to U.S. components for its equipment.\n*****\n> “In some ways, it’s a headline problem. We think of it more as event risk,” said Nadine Terman, CEO and CIO at Solstein Capital. “China thinks in dynasties and U.S. investors seem to think in durations of days and months, so I think we are misunderstanding the duration of their negotiating strategy.”\n*****\n> She said the issues between the two countries go way beyond trade and extend to China’s military aspirations in the South China Sea and its global campaign of influence through the Belt and Road initiative, Chinese President Xi Jinping’s signature program.\n*****\n> “It’s now become more nationalistic, emotional, to say: ‘We’re going against the U.S. and we’ve got to be in it for the long haul.’ I don’t think you have the same emotion here in the U.S. You don’t have the same nationalistic pride to say ‘we have to fight China at all cost,’” she said.\n*****\n> In the past week, Wall Street increasingly began to expect the Trump administration to turn up the pressure on China with another wave of 25% tariffs on the $300 billion or so in goods remaining that have no tariffs. Those tariffs would directly hit American consumer goods and are expected to take a bigger bite out of the economy.\n*****\n> Fears of a trade war hurting global growth and concerns that the U.S. is already beginning to weaken were evident in the bond market. Treasury yields reflected lowered growth expectations. The 10-year hit a low of 2.29% on Thursday and was at 2.32% Friday.\n*****\n> J.P. Morgan economists Friday downgraded their view of the economy, slicing second quarter growth to just 1% from an earlier forecast of 2.25% and first quarter growth of 3.2%. The economists blamed weak U.S. manufacturing data and said risks were signs of weakness in the global economy and also indications that the trade war was hurting business sentiment.\n*****\n> “The concerns the markets have right now are that we’re moving towards a worst case scenario, and that could persist for quite some time,” said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. short rate strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “If that’s the case, then the market is believing economic data, and the Fed will likely need to respond to that by trying to offset and prevent a recession.”\n*****\n> The most important data point in the coming week will be Friday’s personal consumption expenditures, which includes the PCE deflator inflation data that the Fed monitors. It was at 1.6% year-over-year last month, and is expected to be the same for April, well below the Fed’s target of 2% inflation.\n*****\n> Inflation has become a key focus on Wall Street, particularly after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said low inflation appears to be transitory and not enough of a concern to make the Fed cut interest rates. Powell and other Fed officials have stressed the Fed is pausing in its rate hiking cycle, is monitoring the economy and does not yet know which way it will move next.\n*****\n> Solstein Capital’s Terman said she is watching the PCE inflation report to see if it confirms her view that inflation and the economy will be weaker this summer.\n*****\n> She also expects the markets to be choppy, and by late summer, around its annual Jackson Hole symposium, the Fed could indicate it could cut interest rates.\n*****\n> “People are going to start getting even more concerned this summer about the U.S.,” Terman said.\n*****\n> Terman said she has been positioned for lower inflation and slower GDP growth with key holdings in utilities, REITs, Treasurys and gold.\n*****\n> “What would do well this summer? Staples, utilities, health care, REITs. You want fixed income. You want to be underweight tech, energy, financials and industrials,” she said.\n*****\n> There is also home prices data Tuesday and advanced economic indicators Thursday. That comes in addition to a few earnings reports, including Costco, Ulta Beauty and Dollar General.\n*****\n> Markets will also be watching the outcome of European parliamentary elections, and if there is a strong showing by populists, there could be a negative impact on the euro and risk assets.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/YB7FVVl.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/tsse5wM.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/Jx099zV.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/Noafctx.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/mDkvHkf.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FLUiLS1.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/7bYwEj2.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SiGqWZH.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/L2rlfZK.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/FNFloqg.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qhHZ79X.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# S&P 500 Down Four Straight Day After Memorial Day\n\n> Our office will be closed for observance of Memorial Day on Monday, May 27. U.S stock and bond markets will also be closed. As you spend some quality time off with family and friends please take time to commemorate those who have paid the ultimate price while serving in the U.S. military.\n\n> For decades the Stock Trader’s Almanac has been tracking and monitoring the market’s performance around holidays. The trading day after Memorial Day has a mixed record going back to 1971. Both S&P 500 and NASDAQ have declined more often than risen on the day, but average performance is still positive. Since 1986, the frequency of gains has improved, and average performance has also risen however, over the last four years S&P 500 has declined. The second trading day after Memorial Day has since more advances than declines, but average performance is negative for NASDAQ. The third day after appears to have the best long- and short-term record combined with solid average performance.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e49bc44dc78f0206988b762ef5ea68ad/tumblr_inline_ps0eqveTDc1spdppr_640.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Bespoke Report - It's All Relative\n\n> Hut, Hut, Cut! With weaker economic data to contend with this week on both a domestic and international basis, plus escalating tensions between the US and China, investors are increasingly pricing in a higher likelihood of rate cuts from the FOMC before the year is out. Through mid-day Friday, the Fed Fund futures market was pricing in over an 85% chance of a rate cut between now and the January 2020 meeting. Those are the kind of odds that would make James Holzhauer say \"All in.\"\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.bespokepremium.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/rate-odds.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Fed Members Side With “Transitory” Inflation\n\n> Investors just got more details on Federal Reserve (Fed) policymakers’ views of inflation.\n\n> Minutes of the Fed’s most recent meeting, which ended May 1, showed that “many participants” considered slowing consumer inflation as “transitory,” and agreed that the Fed’s current patient approach should help stoke economic growth and inflation. Policymakers’ optimistic view on inflation runs counter to a growing opinion in financial markets that slowing growth in core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) could warrant lower rates.\n\n> Markets think the grace period for a “transitory” excuse has passed, but data show it’s too soon to tell. Another measure of inflation, the Fed Bank of Dallas’s “trimmed mean” PCE measure, points to higher pricing pressures ahead. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the trimmed mean PCE, which has proven to be a less volatile version of core PCE, has hit 2% year-over-year growth for the past several months.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Slowing-Core-PCE-Due-Transitory-Factors.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> “It’s tough to make a case for lower rates with over 3% gross domestic product growth, healthy wage growth, and a labor market close to full employment,” said LPL Research Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “If consumer inflation picks up, the U.S. economy will be near full employment with healthy inflation across the board, fulfilling the Fed’s dual mandate.”\n\n> Of course, much has happened on the global front since the Fed’s last meeting. Trade tensions have flared up again, with the United States raising tariff rates on $200 billion of Chinese imports and threatening to increase rates on the remaining swath of goods. Logically, tariffs should be a catalyst for higher consumer inflation, as higher costs should boost price growth. However, the opposite has happened over the past few months, and there are several factors to consider when thinking about future inflation.\n\n> Overall, we don’t see a strong argument for a rate cut right now, and we side with the Fed in thinking consumer inflation could pick up as wage growth accelerates and growth stabilizes. At the very least, it’s becoming more obvious the Fed doesn’t have enough clarity to move policy in either direction.\n\n*****\n\n# Another Reason For Bulls To Smile\n\n> The S&P 500 Index has officially gained each of the first four months of the year for the first time since 2013. This comes on the heels of the best first quarter since 1998. Six straight months in green has been the best monthly win streak to start a year, and that last happened in 1996.\n\n> Starting a year with strength like this historically has been a good sign, even though stocks in May saw a nearly 5% correction.\n\n> “Although we wouldn’t be surprised to see continued volatility over the coming months, the good news is a great start to a year has had a funny way of eventually resolving higher,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, the rest of the year has been higher an incredible 14 out of 15 times after the first four months were in the green!”\n\n> As our LPL Chart of the Day shows, the S&P 500 returns the rest of the year (final 8 months) have been more than twice as strong as the average year returns—10% versus 4.7%—following four straight monthly gains to kick off a new year. There’s always a catch though, and in this case we’ve seen an average pullback of more than 8% the rest of the year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/A-Strong-Start-To-A-Year-Has-Bulls-Smiling.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n# Earnings Season Takeaways\n\n> We consider earnings season a success based on the amount of upside to prior estimates generated by S&P 500 Index companies despite several headwinds. Companies handily beat expectations to get first quarter earnings up to flat, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Looks-like-we%E2%80%99ll-avert-an-Earnings-recession.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> When earnings season began in mid-April, consensus estimates called for a 4–5% drop in S&P 500 earnings, according to FactSet data. Beating results by this much is impressive considering persistent trade uncertainty and the drag on overseas profits from a strong U.S. dollar. Also consider that the median stock in the S&P 500 has grown earnings several percentage points faster because a few large companies are dragging down the market-cap-weighted calculation.\n\n> Resilient estimates are also encouraging. Since April 15, the 2019 consensus estimate for S&P 500 earnings per share has risen slightly to $168 (a 4% year-over-year increase). We consider that a win given that estimates typically fall during earnings season.\n\n> “Escalating trade uncertainty and the threat of more tariffs are huge wild cards for corporate profits,” said LPL Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “We are hopeful that significant progress can be made on the trade front next month, when President Trump and China’s President Xi are expected to meet at the G20 summit. A prolonged impasse that lasts through the summer would make mid-single-digit earnings growth difficult to achieve in 2019.”\n\n> Our base case remains that we will get a trade deal with China early this summer and consensus expectations for 3–4% earnings growth may prove to be conservative. Earnings are hardly booming, but with a continued economic expansion, low inflation, and low interest rates, we see enough earnings growth ahead to push stocks up to our year-end S&P 500 fair value target of 3,000—though it probably won’t get there in a straight line.\n\n*****\n\n# Pre-election Year June: Tech and Small-caps Best\n\n> June has shone brighter on NASDAQ stocks over the last 48 years as a rule ranking eighth with a 0.6% average gain, up 26 of 48 years. This contributes to NASDAQ’s “Best Eight Months” which ends in June. June ranks near the bottom on the Dow Jones Industrials just above September since 1950 with an average loss of 0.3%. S&P 500 performs similarly poorly, ranking tenth, but essentially flat (–0.02% average). Small caps also tend to fare well in June. Russell 2000 has averaged 0.6% in the month since 1979.\n\n> In pre-election years since 1950, June ranks no better than mid-pack. June is the #8 DJIA month in pre-election years averaging a 0.8% gain with a record of nine advances in seventeen years. For S&P 500, June is #5 with an average gain of 1.2% (10-7 record). Pre-election year June ranks #6 for NASDAQ and #7 for Russell 2000 with average gains of 1.9% and 1.1% respectively. Recent pre-election year Junes in 2015, 2011 and 2007 were troublesome for the market as DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ all declined (Russell 2000 eked out a modest gain in 2015).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/57d94e8a408ad305588ab0473f6f28ec/tumblr_inline_prz1z7mpgq1spdppr_400.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for May 24th, 2019** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VglIB3aJTjA))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 05.26.19** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0SBMubBDW0))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$NIO** \n> * **$MOMO** \n> * **$GOOS** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$PANW** \n> * **$ZS** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$WDAY** \n> * **$NTNX** \n> * **$ULTA** \n> * **$DKS** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$BZUN** \n> * **$DG** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$BNS** \n> * **$YY** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$ASND** \n> * **$CSIQ** \n> * **$CPRI** \n> * **$BAH** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$VMW** \n> * **$AMWD** \n> * **$KEYS** \n> * **$ZUO** \n> * **$BMO** \n> * **$PLAN** \n> * **$JT** \n> * **$HEI** \n> * **$GPS** \n> * **$NXGN** \n> * **$PVH** \n> * **$QTNT** \n> * **$NM** \n> * **$EXPR** \n> * **$SAFM** \n> * **$BITA** \n> * **$CMCO**\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/L2rlfZK.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/TW37RkL.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES FOR THE NEXT 5 WEEKS!](https://i.imgur.com/9gVUm6y.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 5.27.19 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.

If anyone would like to comfort me by suggesting I might still profit somehow, that would be very much appreciated, even if it's a complete lie. Besides offering me a modicum of comfort, reassurance from the community will prove helpful when my wife learns I've been sneaking around with RH again.

He was so distraught and started questioning why he started trading in the first place so I shared a story with him.\n\nA long time ago I used to mix heroin and Molly before I'd go get shit faced at the bar. I always found that combination to be a real mother fucker and allowed me to get my swerve on without the fear of a jealous boyfriend or the guilt of giving some bitch an std. If heroin makes the world a canvas, Molly makes my dick the paintbrush.\n\nAnyway, I'm at the bar one night high, drunk as fuck, and looking for love. In walks a bitch that would've been taken down by ivory poachers if she lived in Africa. You know how even a fat girl has a redeeming quality like a cute face or takes it in the ass? Well, she had none of those but the bar was emptying out at a rather rapid pace and if you know me, you know my motto. \"Pussy you ain't taking is pussy you ain't getting.\" 20 minutes later I had this hambeast in the back of a 1989 Astro cargo van and used her panties to cover the windows. I treated that whore like a Wonkavator and fucked her upways and downways, crossways and aroundways. So many smells violated my olfactory senses but the Molly pushed me to the finish line.\n\nThe next day I was so disgusted with myself I swore I'd never touch another drug, drop of alcohol, or a woman over 118 lbs. Guess what? 3 days later I fucked that same bitch in the same van.\n\nThe moral of the story is you are fucking autistic and are going to lose all of your money.", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "I would subscribe to your newsletter.", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "A lot to mull over.
