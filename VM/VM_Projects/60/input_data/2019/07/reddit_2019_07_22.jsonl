But focusing on earnings is really not the right metric anyways.\n\nInstead, we need to focus what Tesla is actually being managed to do, which isn't GAAP earnings. They are managed for maximum growth given cash. For Tesla, their medium to long term prospects are based on growth to achieve mass market scale. They achieve that growth pretty consistently, but with investor cash to make it so. And honestly, long term investors expect this and want this. Tesla's long term prospects are \\*not\\* secured with short term GAAP profits. Instead, they have to achieve scale in order to drive down costs, otherwise other automakers will be able to out spend them at some point. Now, the recipe for other automakers is far more difficult, as they have to spend money on pretty much every vehicle type out there in order to try to keep their same revenue. That's going to be difficult and they are already warning on profits and dividends.\n\nTherefore, the real metrics to examine are EBITDA and cash flow from ops. We want to see projections on FCF. These provide a much better view on sustained medium term operations. We have to put those in context with expected capex over the next year.\n\nI think the institutional investors are looking at the probabilities of S&P 500 inclusion over the next year. If the chances are low, I don't think there is much broad based accumulation. On the other hand, if the runway appears decent, even without broad based accumulation, there are quite a few TSLA short sellers that are hoping for a bigger financial disaster that may exit.\n\nEven if TSLA reports a non-GAAP break even or better, I think there will be plenty fodder for pretty much every angle to be promoted as true. But after the initial reaction which may very well be based on very short term equity positions (options OI, for instance), the real health of the business will be assessed. The focus on GAAP profitability for the real health of the business is a misdirection that should be challenged.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "As a follow up, GAAP losses != cash losses. That is a fundamental misunderstanding that is commonly promoted even from otherwise financially savvy commentators. Also, the \"Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\" portion of the shareholder's letter is extremely important.\n\nNote that for 2018, the year's cash flow from ops was $2.098 billion and the capex was $2.10 billion for a difference of less than $3 million dollars. That's a significant difference over 2017, where cash flow from ops was negative $60 million and the capex was $3.4 billion. That's the difference coming from initial Model 3 capex spend and going through the early (and failed parts) of the Model 3 production curve.\n\nLast quarter, the net cash from ops was very negative... but they took a lot of one time charges. The TTM net cash from ops for the last 4 quarters looks like this:\n\n* Q2 '18: $-318,711 (ttm)\n* Q3 '18: $1,373,132 (ttm)\n* Q4' 18: $2,097,802 (ttm)\n* Q1' 19: $1,856,572 (ttm)\n\nTheir Q1 guidance for 2019 capex is:\n\n>Our 2019 capex, the vast majority of which will be to grow our capacity and develop new vehicles, is expected to be about $2.0 to $2.5 billion", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Cash flow isn't a great business metric which is why the income statement exists.
