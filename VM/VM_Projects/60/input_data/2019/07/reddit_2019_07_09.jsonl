But Freight itself ROSE 35.9-80% in total volume over the same month depending on freight type](https://i.imgur.com/Y49JnPP.jpg). \n\nWhat happened was that there were mass bankruptcies at the 1 year mark from the tariffs taking effect, then a massive unexpected increase in demand. \n\nAnd now that freight demand has jumped massively, there are not enough trucks to haul them! \n\nI actually own a small logistics company and its almost impossible to get all our loads moved right now. \n\nWhat are the best \"spot freight\" companies in a position to take advantage of this right now? We use Landstar quite often, but even they are running out of capacity and have 1 truck for every 4 trucks being offered to them right now. I was just on their load board and they have over 29,000 loads needing to be hauled right now! \n\nAre there any other large spot freight companies to look at to take advantage of this situation?
