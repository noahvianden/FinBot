Signs that M3 and MY demand are much weaker than it's currently looking like. Nobody can say for sure what the eventual long term demand for these cars is going to be, and I think the M3 is very close to being at least somewhat of a success which bodes well for MY. However, if it turns out that current numbers are not sustainable due to early pent-up demand in EU and M3 sales decline, or flatline and then significantly decline once MY comes out due to cannibalization, and it turns out that long term M3 + MY demand is < 400k / year, that might turn me into a bear. Even < \\~800k / year combined long term demand for these 2 models would be kind of a disappointment to me, but not necessarily make my outlook bearish.\n2. Signs that growth is slowing down and/or that TSLA has significant difficulties ramping up production. M3 ramp up didn't go exactly according to plan and it took them 6 months longer to get to 5k/week than originally planned, but in the grand scheme of things this is not the biggest deal to me. If however, Giga 3 doesn't reach 3k/week until the end of 2020, MY doesn't go into production until 2021 and doesn't reach significant volume until late 2022, and we're talking about production delays of well over a year, that'd worry me.

If however, Tesla does not solve autonomy but another company does, I'd have to seriously rethink my investment.
