You are exposed to 1000 shares, or about $204k at friday's prices\n\nTheta on leaps is very low (2.35 cents per day per contract) but still comes to about  -0.45%APR. In other words, you pay 0.45% of the share price to have the rights to buy the shares at $230. \n\nLEAPs have low delta, meaning you see only partial effects of share price change\n\nOwning shares gets you ~1.5% dividend ( and 100% delta exposure)\n\nTrade war will intensify before it ends, probably in fall 2020. Till then markets will see swings periodically. \n\nGrowth for apple products come from outside the US, if you are looking for a credit card company to invest, see MA or V. \n\n5G infrastructure is expensive, will take long time to see 5G services nationwide (but AT&T may spoof 4GLTE as 5G).\n\nWriting cash secured puts can generate money and give you an opportunity to buy the shares at lower price. Start writing naked puts for 0.15 delta strike a month out for one or many contracts, collect premium until assigned.  This should net you ~18% returns.
