We all know it will rise above 14 at some point, the only question anyone has is when it will do that. To bet against it going never over 14 again, is the equivalent of someone betting that it will never rain again. So you need to find someway to make the trade more lucrative to the other side if you want to find a non-downward sloping market.\n\nAs you already noted this forces most assets tied to the VIX to be downward sloping because no one is willing to bet that it will never rain again. This decline is primarily driven by the rollover cost of the asset throughout the month since VIX futures are in contango and ETF’s are selling the current month VIX contract and buying the next month at a higher price. This is because uncertainty is always higher the further out you look. The best ways to combat this is 1) sell puts so your money so your premium covers the assets natural decline or 2) wait until the VIX futures are no longer in contango. When the VIX spikes and is set to go higher to the +20-40 range the VIX future will flatten out or become backwardated. This means you no longer have to pay for that constant drop in value over time and can enter into a position that is not automatically losing value over time. Unfortunately the second strategy can only help with large, long term VIX spike and can’t really help with spikes at the 14 level.

In cyber security im bullish on ZS PANW CYBR and PD/TUFN dont meet what I'm looking for but I do want to trade them when there's options liquidity. I made a lil post on TUFN before their IPO about their rather low valuation. Also following similar low profile recent ipos like YEXT SMAR PVTL & ZUO. Watching to see if they'll have their days. I really like all their individual businesses besides SMAR which I really don't see the value in - ironically that's the one to start performing. I see serious value in ZUO if they can get it together but they released awful guidance. YEXT is a great concept imo, want to see the performance.

In short TWLO leverages VPNs internationally for lower mobile text & call rates while acting as an all in one platform to handle companies virtual interaction.

Instead I can increase certainty (speculation of course) by understanding specific sectors -semis, china-tech, tech- and by increasing my time scale I can profit off long term strategies.
