Been reading thru some of their conference call transcripts and pulled some data from their 10-Q's/10-K's. \n\nTheir estimates don't add up. They say they'll have a minimum of 25% growth in subscription revenue, and stay flat for services revenue. Well for one, I highly doubt that Vault revenue goes up 50% while services revenue remains stagnant. \nThey sandbag their earnings constantly, but I truly don't see a scenario where they don't beat and raise overall guidance for the year.\n\nGonna re-iterate that their guidance is 655m, but I'm leaning toward them making something like 690m. \nAlso, lets give it the bare minimum of their guidance. They say AT LEAST 25% subscription growth and flat services growth.\nMeaning, at the very least, adding those estimates up, you get 652.6m. I'm pretty sure they'll do much better than this in subscription growth, but services may only grow about 5-10%.\n\nI have two worries here:\n\n1. It's priced in, after the 100% run-up over the past year.\n\n2. VEEV has been shifty about how much their CRM business has actually been growing. While Vault is killin' it, CRM growth seems to be slowing. If there's a question from an analyst regarding CRM growth prospects, or along those lines, I wouldn't be too thrilled on their outlook.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I'll respond more in depth tomorrow since it's already 1:30AM here but a quick point is that I think you are confusing subscription and services. Services is their consulting service that is largely through their acquisition of Zinc Ahead. They don't see that growing in terms of having more than 10% of their total revenue. However, they play on subscription, which includes vault, database, cloud, and etc; They expect that sector to grow largely because of vault catering to a niche. \n\nSecondly, I'm not quite sure where you are seeing CRM sales stagnating. 2016 was a record year for CRM and they expect the same for 2017. Just look at the large players in CRM like Salesforce, Oracle, and MSFT over the past several quarters. ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I guess stagnating wasn't the right term. They've forecasted 15% growth in CRM, 50% growth in vault, and 1-2%ish growth in services. It's just not the eye-popping 30% YoY growth that they've seen in the past.\n\nAlso, yeah, I understand that services got a bump thru the Zinc acquisition, but they had services revenue BEFORE then right? Like...they say Vault was 35% of TOTAL revenue. I'd imagine it's something like an 80/20 split for vault between recognition as subscription vs. services. \n\n\"Services revenue for the quarter was $31 million, up from $24 million one year ago. Sequentially, this was up slightly from $29 million in Q3 and well above our expectations. This outperformance was driven primarily by a few one-time items, including earlier than expected recognition of fixed fee milestones.**In addition, we continue to see robust customer demand, especially around R&D Vault projects.**\" - From the last earnings call.\n\nI'm pretty sure this implies that Vault isn't booked purely as subscription and support revenue, and that it also has a services component.\n\nIf what you're saying is true, that vault is recognized purely as subscription revenue, they're gonna crush it, because they specifically say that Vault will grow by at least 50% in subscriptions. At 35% of 2016 revenue, that's currently 174m out of 544m. If THAT grows 50%, it's 285m, which is a difference of 95m. Their guidance is for total gain of 111m between FY 2017 and FY 2016. They could beat their guidance with Vault alone.\n\nThoughts?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I think Vault is booked purely as subscription. But what happens is that once they get customers as subscribers they often times will purchase services. I remember reading it somewhere nestled into their 10k that services have gone up because of their subscribers utilizing that part of the business. I can't say for sure how Vault is completely recorded but that is my hunch from going through the 10k. Either way it's going to be a good quarter with a beat but can't say by how much.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Thanks for this post, picked up like 20 shares yesterday & wish it was more, but can't complain about 4.5% in a day... will probably hold through earnings based on your sentiment.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You enjoying the steady gains?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I cashed out at $60.70 and got into ATVI at 55.14 which has been working out well, but I see VEEV is still powering on.
