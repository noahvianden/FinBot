{"title": "$SNAP Short DD", "selftext": "preface: fuck you. just because.\n\nDisclosure: I’m short $SNAP through July $20 Puts and May 19 $22 Puts. The July puts were bought the day that options first starting trading on the security and the May 19 puts were bought on Friday. I sold 60% on my May 19 puts right before close today up 30% in one trading day. My position is pretty small but I intend to increase it a bit today and tomorrow if the stock trades up. I tried to be objective looking at the data but it's hard when you have a pre-conceived notion of the results.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/cWNCDu9.png\n* This screenshot is shit because my broker is retarded and I had to patch two images together. Fuck em.\n\nFirst off, no one knows how to properly value SNAP. If anyone tells you they do, they’re lying. The only metrics that matter are user growth, advertising revenue growth, and spending growth. Snapchat has a pretty decent advertising system and they’re building out their own ad platform, which will be a big bullish bump if they can stick it out until then. Unfortunately they won’t.\n\nWednesday they will post declining Daily Active User (DAU) numbers for the first time since they started tracking. I’ve seen talk on here about how numbers are going to be better than expected because Snapchat had 161m DAU in December 2016 even though they only had on average 158m DAU in Q4. If that was the whole story then things would be all good and nice, but unfortunately these numbers aren’t seasonally adjusted. What they fail to take into account is that the run-up to Christmas and the week after are the busiest predictable brief period of each year for new user acquisition. \n\nIf we look at the Google Search Index results we see a big bump every single year going into Christmas and New Years that falls off by the second week of January. The bump varies in magnitude from year to year but it’s always there, this year the jump in search volume was 40% between the end of November and the week of Christmas. Followed by a 26% drop-off by the second week of January. The year before we saw a 37% bump followed by a 17% drop-off by the second week. If we take the product of these two values we see that in the time around Christmas 2015 there was a 1.37*(0.83) = 1.13 for a sustained net new search volume of 13.2%. If we look at the numbers for this Christmas the net new search volume was only 4.5%.\n\nIt’s important to show that these numbers correlate with DAU growth so here is a comparison between the two for all DAU numbers that Snapchat has ever released. It’s not perfect but it’s pretty damn close.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Fx8QY5a.png\n\nNow that it looks like GSI might be a good indicator for DAU let’s look at the data as far back as we can go.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/dA3Lejn.png\n\nWhat we see here is that Snapchat is in its longest ever sustained downtrend. We also see the spike at Christmas to bolster the December DAU numbers, and we see what could have been the biggest elephant in the room, the SNAP IPO. As we can see, although there was a near Christmas sized spike for a couple weeks when Snapchat went public, the novelty quickly faded and the new users that it brought in realized why they weren’t previously using the app. \n\nThe killer here is Instagram Stories. Whether people realize that it’s having a large impact or not, the GSI data doesn’t lie, Instagram has seen healthy growth (backed up by their recent 700 million user milestone) while Snapchat GSI is down close to 40% since the introduction. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/Zf2gY2D.png\n\nThat said, trading off of GSI is really dumb. I’ve been burned by it recently (fuck you iRobot) but there’s a big difference between a spike and a decline. With iRobot the GSI trend was actually correct and the spike this past holiday season revenue was bigger than it had been in the past, but the issue with a spike is that you need to take into account increased advertising spending which overwhelmed the increased sales to cause a drop. Snapchat on the other hand has been aggressively expanding and has not been short on publicity yet still has declining GSI numbers. In this case I think they will be surprisingly reliable.\n\nI ran a survey yesterday and even though you’re a bunch of degenerates there’s still value in gauging your attitudes. Your overwhelming perception of what is happening in the app is wrong. I chopped out all the data for people who indicated that they hadn’t used Snapchat in the last six months, nothing personal I just wanted to opinion of users rather than second-hand tales.\n\nFrom the extracted data: 89.6% of you do not think that the user base is shrinking. Most lean towards flat numbers but a full 32% think that there has been noticeable growth in the past six months. On top of that only 11% of you think that celebrity Instagram use is declining. There have been a few reports put out by marketing companies but I think the most damning one was  put-out back in February by Fighter Interactive which claimed a 20-40% drop in story views for their clients. There was another report by Delmondo which claims a drop-off of 40% in unique view numbers between July and November 2016. That’s bad but matches up pretty directly with the GSI data. \n\nAnother interesting statistic from the survey was that 32.5% of you said that you were using Snapchat less and less in the past six-months which just doesn’t mesh with the perception that the user base isn’t shrinking. If we look at the evolution of your usage we see a decrease in heavy and daily users who are moving towards being light daily users instead. Even if this doesn’t impact DAU numbers that much, it should be a big blow to advertising revenue.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/CpaKIDD.png\n\nAnother interesting metric is looking at the iTunes download charts to see platform competition between Instagram and Snapchat. Snapchat has been pretty dominant since adding filters on iOS since they’ve always put most of their focus into Apple products (does the Android app still take screenshots instead of pictures?). What we saw in late Q4 and early Q1 though was Instagram beat out Snapchat for downloads in the US for the first time in a while. It’s wasn’t until Snapchat had their IPO that they were finally able to reclaim the download lead between the two platforms, though it still ended up being beat out by MLB Tap Star and Gangstar New, FaceApp, Ballz, Bitmoji, and Rollercoaster Tycoon in various Q1 weeks.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/41EwfCs.png\n\nI also looked at data from /r/Snapchat but it only goes back a year so I was unable to observe seasonal patterns. What we see is a big dump in November and then a slow climb back up through March, but /r/Snapchat users are just a very small segment of the Snapchat user base. In fact since it mainly caters to lonely young men and since it appears that most of the posts get few responses, the users may not even notice a decline in the Snapchat user base. For that reason I don’t think the trend is a good indicator of application growth. \n\nIf it does turn out to be a good indicator though, we are still only seeing numbers in range of August-October, which suggests that we should not be seeing a large addition to the user base.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/WQsu45O.png\n\nThis is what I’m projecting: a modest decrease of 2 million daily active users. This puts usage numbers about flat with October and November but below the December bump. \n\nhttp://imgur.com/idzBjkm.png\n\nIt’s tough to predict the share price movement even if my analysis is correct but this would definitely be bad news for the public. My guess is that a DAU number of 156m would drop the stock down to about $17, a crash of about 25%. \n\ntldr; idk man fuck Snapchat\n\nedit: cheers for the gold, don't deserve it though tbh, user numbers were much better than I was expecting.", "id": "6a6ajq", "created_utc": 1494345542.0, "score": 93, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 58, "comments": [{"body": "We need more posts like this. \n\nGreat job faggot.

I have no data to back this up, but I believe snapchat is opened more times a day than instagram by a user that has both. If you're a well-adjusted normie you open snapchat every time you get a snap, sometimes a hundred times a day.
