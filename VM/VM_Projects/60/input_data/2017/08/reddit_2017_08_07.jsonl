{"title": "Possible 10-bagger in 10 years: $SHOP", "selftext": "Stock is worth about $10 billion.  I can easily see this reach $100 billion valuation in 10 years. \n\nShopify (SHOP) is a company in the middle of two huge secular trends: eCommerce and Cloud. Basically SHOP allows small/medium sized business to setup webstores.  But the platform does so much more: inventory management, social media advertising, financing, POS retail, web design, ect. Really too much to list.\n\nHow powerful is the Shopify platform?\n\nAmazon and Facebook gave up on their platforms and decided to partner with Shopify instead.\n\nNow realize this company is very volitle.  I would not be surprise if there are periods in which the stock drops 50% in a few months.  The key is to hold steady and don't hold a too concentrated position.", "id": "6s5y9g", "created_utc": 1502117015.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 50, "comments": [{"body": "Don't you try to pump this every couple months?
