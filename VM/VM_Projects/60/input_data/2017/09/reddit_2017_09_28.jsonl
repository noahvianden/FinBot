So buy in now, hold until earnings and sell either immediately before, or after earnings depending on your ability to trade AH. \n\nAMD will post some seriously good numbers, but analysts are still hanging on their GPU sales being tied to the ‘short term trend’ of coin mining, and their CPUs meeting severe competition in terms of price/performance from INTC very soon.  So they look at AMD in the opposite way they would look at TSLA, which loses money now but will make tons in the future, AMD is making money now, but they’re hedging / betting that they lose money in the future. \n\nSo, AMD is actually a long play; buy, accumulate and hold until there are 4-5 quarters of consistently positive numbers and guidance.  \n\nFor now, it’s a high beta stock and you run the short term risk of having bad press plus overall market movements negatively affect your near term profit goals.
