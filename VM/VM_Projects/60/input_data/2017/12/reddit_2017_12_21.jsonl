{"title": "70k Dont know which stocks I should buy", "selftext": "29 Years old with 70K to invest.  I invested when I was around 20 and ended up losing 5k on Kodak and said screw investing. Stop invested and started saving.  Well, October this year i checked my brokerage account and was pleasantly surprised that my MSFT I bought years ago doubled.  So I decided to invest again, two weeks before iPhone X launch I decided to buy some apple stock at 155 and sold at 175(lucky).  Then I bought Nike at 50 and sold at 52(damnit).  Then i bought TSLA (WOW Rollercoaster) at 335 and sold at like 335.50 (Happy I am no longer with them).  From there I bought a local company ended up selling at a wash. I ended up trading about 10 bluechips for a decent profit.  I am currently still invested MSFT,  AMD and LMT.  I am not sure if I should continue down this path.  I am really thinking about just putting it in an ALLY CD for a 2% after 12 months?

Get a book or two on the subject. I'd recommend staying away from trend trading and look more into undervalued investing. \n\nLong term, invest in ETFs (or index funds if you see yourself regularly adding to the fund throughout the year). Pick something risk averse like Vanguard. Spread out your portfolio to S&P500, Total Market, and a few sectors like financials and IT. Maybe throw in a dividend ETF as well. Don't touch these.\n\nI emphasize that you should leave your long term investments alone. Let them do their work. For your short term investments, learn with the little you start with and go from there. Never risk what you can't afford to lose and never risk anything where you don't know what you are doing.
