{"title": "Background on NVDA", "selftext": "First things first, I am just as qualified as the next person to give stock advice. Which is not qualified. Anyhoo,\n\nThis is a background for those who want to understand NVDA, why its stock has surged recently, and where is going (hint; its up). \n\n1. NVDA is an established forefront company, so there is low risk of the price going down significantly, even in the short term. Their GPUs (the part of a computer that creates a visualization of a 3D-space) been a dominant force in the computing industry for a long time, and the graphics cards are top of the line. For a long time, this has been relevant to just GAMING as an industry, but it is very convenient that graphical processing is also very much in demand in a very new, extremely high growth industry which is...\n\n2. Self-driving cars. Self driving cars need to be able to understand the nearby physical world that the many cameras are seeing. These cars going to change the world, and NVDA has, if im not mistaken, the first mass-producible product that beats all competitors in terms of both performance and physical size. A small computer basically that fits into a small space in a car to be the brains of a self-driving car. If any auto maker wants to make a self driving car, they're going to look towards NVDA. \n\n3. Artificial Intelligence. Another massive growth-potential area with NVDA is first to the boat to. I believe that it will be an NVDA chipset that produces the first man-made self-aware computer, the implications of which are huge. NVDA is established in super-computing and deep learning, which are going to be absolutely essential in this autonomous-industrial-information age. \n\nNumbers 2 and 3 are why I think NVDA has surged in the last 6 months, as people have realized that self-driving cars are going to dominate, and companies like Ford and basically any car maker thats not Tesla, are going to need to purchase the computer for self-driving cars from outside of their own company. \n\n.4. Now as a product, a real practical artificial intelligence is decades away, but NVDA right now is providing cloud-based deep-learning computing for those companies or individuals who don't want to create their own apparatus. Basically contracting out computing-jobs to NVDA's super computers. This puts this technology thats is decades away and makes it profitable TODAY, which is huge for investors, something Tesla doesn't have and why people keep on saying TSLA is a shit overvalued stock (its not, its ahead of the curve). \n\nSo in the future, NVDA will be creating practical and marketable AI products, probably be in over 90% of self driving cars, will still be a computer gaming industry leader, and offers almost infinite supply of cloud based computing while their long-term vision is achieved. You can get all of that TODAY, for $113.75 a share. Thats a fucking deal. I bought 20. \n\nTheres a chance I'm wrong on: \"companies like Ford and basically any car maker thats not Tesla, are going to need to purchase the computer for self-driving cars from outside of their own company.\" https://www.recode.net/2017/2/10/14576730/ford-investment-uber-google-self-driving-cars-argo-ai\n", "id": "5tacd9", "created_utc": 1486765029.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 63, "comments": [{"body": "Aren't the shares way too overvalued atm?

{"title": "A few lessons I want to share after having played NVDA earnings...", "selftext": "Though we will not know how NVDA will react tomorrow when the market opens, I'm betting that it opens flat or slightly down. Furthermore, the AH action has given encouraging clues as to how everything will go down tomorrow. \n\nI played NVDA earnings by selling puts:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/jse4l\n\n**Lession One: It's always more advantageous to sell options rather than buy them.**\n\nIf you have substantial amounts of money to play with, or you already own the underlying, it's better sell OTM calls and puts than to buy them. Sell them close to expiry to capture the IV crush. It's really not worth it to buy options unless you have very little money, as most options expire worthless. \n\nIn my case, someone bought those $110 strike puts expiring Friday that I underwrote. I am fairly confident that Nvidia will close above $110 tomorrow, so the puts will expire worthless and I'll end up keeping the premium. \n\nOf course, I was assuming a huge risk - what if Nvidia fell below $110? I'd be left bagholding the shares or be forced to assume a loss. This is where more advanced option strategies like spreads come into play - these limit your potential gains but also give you a cushion in case things go south by defining your loss as well. I personally plan to read up on them more next time I play earnings so that I can limit my risk - I took a huge risk on this one.\n\n**Lesson Two: Think critically and make your best educated guess on where the share price might end up.**\n\nIn my case, I felt that Nvidia was going to beat earnings. This thing had risen over 6% in the week running up to earnings, anything except a huge blowout was going to move this thing. That said, expectations matter too. Nvidia has beaten Wall Street forecasts for both bottom line and top line for the past five quarters. Is it likely they will miss? Probably not, but it would appear that people were already anticipating a beat. \n\nRead past quarterly earnings releases, see the stock's behavior before and after earnings, and see how management manages Wall Street expectations to get some clues. Do they always seem to beat? Or are they the more \"fuck Wall Street and their estimates\" types? Furthermore, what did the company do last quarter? Release a new product? Sign up new key partnerships? Take market share from competitors? Those things are key too when evaluating the possibilities in a holistic manner. \n\nStill, even the best educated guess can come afoul of nasty surprises like poor guidance or just plain old randomness. In the past, I used to YOLO on earnings, but now, I do not play earnings unless I cross out enough \"unknowns\" so that I feel comfortable with my overall hypothesis. With regards to NVDA, I felt that enough unknowns were off the table that I could make a bet on the stock price staying mostly flat after earnings - which turned out to be mostly right in the AH. \n\nLastly, go with your gut. Your gut isn't right all the time, but you would be surprised at how things turn out if you make an educated decision beforehand. \n\nTLDR: Stop pissing money away on options unless you are poor, and start making educated guesses when it comes to earnings instead of YOLOing blind.
