That means the 1 billion they raised in issuing new stock and raising convertible debt was completely wasted.\n\nTesla curently has 2,2 billion cash on hand. They also lowerd their net loss from q1 2018 (784 million) to q2 2018 (642 million without the one time restructuring cost)\n\n30 % of Teslas debts is also in convertiables. If the Stock price is at 360 in March 2019 they can convert 1,1 billion debt into stock (this would be a good time to buy options for that date since you know how musk is.)\n\nTheir competitors are Shit!\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 is the most efficient car at highway speeds in the world! (EPA rating)\n\nThe Tesla Model 3 can charge with 120 KW. Since it is highly efficient and can charge faster than every other non-Tesla ev it can charge 440 miles per hour. The chevrolet Bolt for example can charge ONLY 180 miles per hour.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VABvS9zfuiI\n\nToyota and Ford don't even have a dedicated electric car yet. And the Nissan leaf competes imho in another price range. (and has currently problems with battery overheating.) BTW. The Model 3 already sold more cars than the Nissan leaf in 2018.\n\nIn 2016 and in 2017 the Model S was the most sold electric car. in the world. In 2018 the Model 3 (is currently) the most sold electric car in the world.\n\n>. No company that burns through so much cash flow with NO money going to shareholders is going to last.\n\nNo shit.... Tesla obviously will burn less cash in the future...\n\n\n\n", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}
