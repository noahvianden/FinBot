You are right the index does use midpoint bid ask. Tho those are real orders sent to the exchange with the money held even if not filled so not just some theoretical willing to pay prices.

VIX uses calls on strikes below F, Puts on strikes above F and both puts and calls at F.\n\nIt then does alot of normalization as far as how large the strike spread is (difference between strikes) and how far out of the money the option is..   It uses all this to calculate a value for the implied volatility of each expiry and weights then based on days to expiry..  Multiply by 100 and ta-da, VIX.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis explanation is very much simplified - if you need all the gory details, check out [http://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/vixwhite.pdf](http://www.cboe.com/micro/vix/vixwhite.pdf)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've written software that accurately calculates VIX from the options based on their paper..\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "OP is literally retarded.
