Your example is flawed because each holder of shares doubles their shares, which doesn't happen with buybacks. \n\nBuybacks: The company loses capital, so each shareholder loses value per share. However, this is 1:1 canceled out from the lowering of numbers of shares, making each share a larger %.\n\nIt does generate value though because each share now holds a larger %, which means that you \"get\" more earnings per share in all future business, either through the company holding the earnings for you or through dividends.\n\nIf a dividend giving company does buybacks, assuming no future dilution, you will permanently get a larger dividend. This is how buybacks returns to shareholders. If it had no change, similar to splitting (aka how you describe it), buy backs would have 0 effect and never be done.

Tesla got fucked hard in the press for various immaterial reasons such as Elon calling someone a pedo, some made up bankruptcy narrative, etc. This rally is a relief rally, but there's a major catalyst on the horizon: it's called Q3 profitability. You probably weren't born yet, but in 2013 the set up for the stock was almost identical: model s just came out, everyone is shouting bankruptcy, profit, and squeeze. I think the same thing is about to happen over the next few quarters. Tesla at $350 is only a little generous, but the baseline price for this stock is to be bat shit crazy 500x 10yr fwd p/e generous. So based on typical Tesla valuation, you're going to see $5000 per share pretty soon. The general rule of thumb is to short 1-2 months after everyone is done circle jerking Tesla in the media and go long when people are shouting bankruptcy. This might be the last chance for irrational exuberance in Tesla.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "$5000 hahaha ok buddy.
