Bacteria are present at low levels in the urine of healthy people not suffering from a urinary tract infection, Evann Hilt of Loyola University of Chicago reported May 18 at a conference of the American Society for Microbiology. Now, Hilt and her colleagues are figuring out what bacteria make up the normal bladder community and whether a change in that community might trigger urinary problems.\n\n>It appears that the urban legend about urine being sterile has its roots in the 1950s, Hilt says, when epidemiologist Edward Kass was looking for a way to screen patients for urinary tract infections before surgery. Kass developed the midstream urine test (still used when you pee in a cup) and set a numerical cutoff for the number of bacteria in normal urine: not more than 100,000 colony-forming units (cell clusters on a culture dish) per milliliter of urine. A person tests “negative” for bacteria in their urine as long as the number of bacteria that grow in a lab dish containing the urine falls below this threshold. “It appears that the dogma that urine is sterile was an unintended consequence,” Hilt says.\n\nhttps://www.sciencenews.org/blog/gory-details/urine-not-sterile-and-neither-rest-you\n\n>But it's apparent that many doctors are still under the impression that urine is sterile (unless someone has a urinary tract infection). That's likely a holdover from the days when bacteria in the body was thought of as a negative thing—the source of infections—as opposed to the complicated garden we now know to exist within us. It would be absurd to assume that a healthy urinary tract has absolutely no bacteria in it, given the abundance of microbes throughout our body. In fact, research indicates that replenishing the \"good\" bacteria found in the vagina can help prevent or treat urinary tract infections—so it seems likely that these friendly bacteria often traffic there.\n\n>So even if urine was sterile at some point, you better believe it's teeming with microbial life by the time it finishes its journey to your toilet (or wherever you're putting it).\n\n>Indeed, recent studies have indicated that bacteria are present in urine, though bacterial counts are lower in healthy urine than in the pee of someone suffering from an infection (duh).\n\nhttps://www.popsci.com/urine-sterile-drinking-pee\n\nSo, you're wrong. As you put it; Full stop.\n\nSecondly, here's a basic test. Swab anything in/on your body. Literally anywhere. It will grow bacteria, if given food. Your body is 91% bacteria:\n\n>The human body contains trillions of microorganisms — outnumbering human cells by 10 to 1. Because of their small size, however, microorganisms make up only about 1 to 3 percent of the body's mass (in a 200-pound adult, that’s 2 to 6 pounds of bacteria), but play a vital role in human health.\n\nhttps://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-human-microbiome-project-defines-normal-bacterial-makeup-body\n\nAnd you're telling me that the ***urinary tract*** is as clean as a clean room? ***The fuck?*** FFS ***air*** has bacteria in it, and air gets *everywhere*.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Well I'll be damned.
