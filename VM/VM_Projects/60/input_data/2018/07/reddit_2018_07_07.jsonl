So how many more times does micron have to prove bears wrong till it trades at a normal tech p/e. Yes bears cyclical argument sees memory as a commodity that will see a surplus in supply. But demand is out pacing supply and is seen to keep growing due to the direction where tech is moving. Manufacturing memory isn’t as easy as it used to be due to cost.
