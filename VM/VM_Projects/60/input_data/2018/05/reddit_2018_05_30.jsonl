{"title": "Turning 18 on Friday. Planning on sticking my toes in the stock market", "selftext": "Hey there Reddit community. As the title explains I am turning 18 and plan on experiencing the highs and lows of the stock market. Fear not for I am not entering with a “ get rich quick mentality “. Nor am I coming in with the mindset to double or triple my money. I am simply just amazed at some of the communities formed from the stock market such as this one. If I make an extra $20 or $30 from NKE or DIS then hey guess who’s treating themselves to ice creme :). I plan on becoming somewhat active to the best of my ability and would love for any advice from the veterans to the intermediates. I plan on starting off by using Robinhood but am willing to try different sites. Please fill free to comment any extra stuff I should know.... again I repeat I am not here with a get rich quick mentality nor do I expect to double or triple my money. I just want to be able to say been there done that. Thanks in advance!

If A) I would highly recommend reading very seriously about index funds. The power of starting to pump any spare income into these at a young age is incredible, and at this stage could almost be considered mathematically proven to be the best way to use the market to look after your financial future.\n\nIf B), then I would start by reading The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, and looking up any terms you don't understand. It's likely there'll be a lot of it you can't really grasp (there still is for me) and you'll probably end up skipping some of it, but it will give you a good basis for understanding what sort of factors are at play.\n\nDoing both A) and B) is very possible, and is what most people end up doing to an extent. I do recommend keeping them separate though.", "score": 91, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you! Thank you thank you. Most definitely plan on looking for the book at my local library.

Like have money set aside for both?", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Essentially yes. I would keep your plans, your investments, and perhaps most importantly your emotions completely separate. The thinking is really that I am personally absolutely convinced that there is no question that the 'best' thing to do is to put as much money into an index fund (either something tracking the S&P 500 or the entire stock market) as early as possible and just completely forget about it other than continuing to buy as regularly as you can (and that includes, and indeed is particularly the case if the market drops by 40% and it looks like you're making huge losses. Buy more when it's cheaper!). You don't even need to talk to a banker about this- do a little reading about it, and get yourself set up at Fidelity or Vanguard. If you start doing this seriously at 18 and earn any kind of money in your life, you almost can't help but end up rich (but it may take decades).\n\nHowever despite all this I can't deny that 'playing' with picking stocks is extremely fun and I love it. So, by keeping them separate what I mean is you want to be prioritizing the index funds, knowing that stock picking is not for your serious future but for the fun of it. Therefore, for this part of the game, work out what you can afford to lose/spend per month, and allow yourself that amount to mess around with. You may end up doing well and beating the market but if you do, don't get carried away. It's not at all unlikely that you can do this for a few years, but it's basically proven that you're extremely unlikely to in the long run. Anything you get from this bucket is fun and a bonus. If you get something terribly wrong and you lose it all, you learnt from it and it's no tragedy.\n\nTwo buckets- One bucket for saving/investing/looking after your future, one bucket for play.\n\n", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit never seen better advice on Reddit ", "score": 12, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is really great advice.

The skills you will be picking up now will benefit you for the rest of your life!\n\nSome suggestions from an older trader.  :)\n\n- First, consider opening a paper trading account to practice and \"see\" how things work.  Think or Swim (TOS) has a very good paper account, there are others you can look at as well.  \n\nEven if you trade on RH because of the lack of commissions, that app does not have the analysis capabilities that a platform like TOS has.  So you can do your research on TOS and then move to RH.  However it wouldn't surprise me if you end up doing all your trading on TOS eventually.  \n\n- Next, develop a trading plan where you spell out your stock selection process, when to open a trade, when to close it, and what you will do if the trade goes against you.  Few people make a consistent profit without some form of trading plan that calls the above out.\n\n- Lastly, when you do start trading with real money think about solid blue chip dividend paying stocks that are rated as bullish.  \n\nNKE is rated as bullish, but the dividend is only 1.13% this morning.  \n\nDIS is also rated bullish and pays a 1.69% dividend.  There are others that pay a bigger divi, but your initial stock picks are pretty darn good!\n\nBest to you!  -Scot\n\nedit: adding link to paper trade account:  https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/tools/papermoney-stock-market-simulator-16078", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Much much appreciated.
