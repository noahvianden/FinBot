{"title": "What will the market open on Monday at?", "selftext": "What news happened over the weekend after market close? How will this impact market on Monday. Personally I’m all in on calls on apple and qqq. I’m atheist but praying hardcore to god right now hoping for a good 4-5% bounce next week. \n\nThe past week has been brutal, Nasdaq and sp500 both down 8% or so. It doesn’t seem like extreme panic selling all at once like in 87 and 01 and 08 tho as there seems to have been morning rallies every day. Fundamentally, the market has been shaken by 4 things. 1) China trade deal talks falling out 2) fed raising rates and tightening the balance sheet 3) slowing growth fears in the global economy and 4) monkey in the Whitehouse throwing shit on the wall\n\nBecause of this market has fallen 20% from its highs. The last 12-14% of which fell nearly straight down with no real bounces in the past 2 weeks. Technical analysis suggests we’re due for a bounce and we should get one in January. But it’s getting shakey as hell with 1 bad news after another recently. \n\nPersonally I think the last 2 week drops are purely technical due to fears of the fed tightening. Raising the rates to 3% next year is not the end of the world. Inflation is still manageable and we absolutely need to raise the rates. Prior to the 13th every time the market as a whole fell the utilities index rose look at XLU. Since the 13th though it has dropped with the market suggesting it’s simply a broad market sell off based on fear. The situation is nothing like 2001 or 1987 though. So I don’t expect it to keep going vertically down. Even so it’s been 9 straight sessions of selloff. Ths spy resistance of 240 is an important one to follow. I expect it to bounce 4-5% off of that. I do think next year we’ll see negative returns in the market. \n\nTl:dr buy short term calls each time it touches support since this isn’t a selloff due to fundamentals but more so technicals and fear. I’m high as fuck this weekend to numb the pain of my portfolio. Excuse me if this post don’t make sense.
