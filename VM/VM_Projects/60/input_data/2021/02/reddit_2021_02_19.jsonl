After 9 days of 9 plays, where every single trade made money, I still get people that thing I am a bot, a shill, I do pump and dumps. First of all this is a forum, I would say majority of people read threads for ideas, opinions, information, and the vast majority actually want plays that make sense. Also, no I do not work for a hedge fund, I am not paid to talk down GME AMC NIO or TSLA. In all honesty, a hedge fund or analyst would not pay me to post, why? Because you know what, I will work for a fund or analyst, however my price tag is $500,000 annually with benefits as well. Or, if I am a portfolio manager a salary is not needed, I want 1% of the portfolio assets and .05% for everything above 10% of the portfolio. That is actually cheap for top money managers... and I am actually somewhat serious....I am posting on these boards because I am not able to post on Bets yet (9 million members) I do hope that if and when I do I open eyes and if a manager, Ray Dalio, Carl Icahn, David Tepper, has someone that he pays to troll, let me know those are my demands... I say this because after 9 days of different and daily plays I get these messages. Are you even reading the plays and notice every single play has made money? Listen, I do have a motive, it is to make money, and I hope everyone else makes money if they choose to take action. I do not pump and dump! These are not shill companies like NIO! Printing shares every few months for cash...\n\nAlso, remember I am giving you daily plays with no compensation and no expectation of compensation. I am not telling anyone what to do or giving investment advice. I am giving everyone insight on a day trader and giving free access to daily trades. That said, please check the track record since the very first post 2/8/2021 \n\nThis is not a game for me, it is real money, and it should not be for you. I find it sad that on BETS they glorify losses and laugh... This isnt funny and if you agenda isnt to make money you can read my posts with a grain of salt, take in the amusement laugh if you will. I have been trading since about 15 and from the year 1995. Trades were over the phone and $50 a trade! I started with about $2,000. If the nasdaq didnt crash in March of 2000, who knows, I could be butting heads with Dalio, Tepper, Griffin. The nasdaq as a whole was down 83% in 2000. I was down 70%. What I most learned from this was not to buy in shill companies. We have all made mistakes, it is what we learn from them. With this crash and being about 20, I isolated myself and no longer had the ambition to be a money manager.. but who knows I may come out from the shadows if this really brings me a draw. Now the point of this paragraph is last night I was going back and forth with someone over the company Sea Limited, stock symbol SE. I tried to give kinda advice and suggest selling half, take some profits and it began to spin into an argument. Listen, no company should trade at 135 billion with no earnings. None, end of story. I dont need to hear rhetoric from any CEO, CFO or the company's overview and pipe dreams. I am not here to wait 3-5 years and hope you arent either. That said, I do like SE, and I suggested that if this company pulls back to 75, I will trade it again, it is now at 275. You can't imagine what this caused. I make money on what is happening now, maybe, maybe 52 weeks out, but dont tell me about 3-5 years, sorry I dont want to hear it. \n\nMy plays make you money today, tomorrow within a few days. Sorry they dont go to the moon, but every single play was a money maker. Yes, I can stock pick even for 1 year out...but I will not pay a premium for a stock now, where the evaluation may materialize in 3-5 years. Sorry TSLA lovers. Telling you the truth!\n\nNow back to what we are here for\n\nYesterday for us was awesome. I traded PLTR 3 rounds (buy and sell), 50 cents each round. I also bought it back at 25 and still own it. I will sell again for 50 cents or more\n\nTuesday - RKT, awesome yesterday I also cashed out at 20.30. I was in 20.25, 19.90 and 19.75. I completely cashed out will buy again. For those of you that dont understand why I dont generally do long term plays please refer to my original post Tuesday morning on RKT. I explain it in detail\n\nWednesday - NOK, I cashed out yesterday at 4.12, the news was good and I will buy back again at 4.05 if I can... also I cashed out for other opportunities. Yes I do make more trades then I highlight here, however, I am giving plays for free with no expectation for compensation so why give ever trade? \n\nWednesday Bonus - ALL, I still own it at 105.50 and 105.75, remember I did cash out my shares from 104.20 at 105\n\nThursday PLTR - 24.75 to 25.25, 25.50x 2, Back in at 25, yes, with super luck, it is much higher in the pre market and I may sell half at 8am.\n\nTodays play\n\nCLOV - Yes their is alot of controversy with CLOV, spacs, the short report and honestly I am not at all a fan of Chamath (SPCE) is 1 of the biggest shill companies but we arent here about that. CLOV is actually a real insurance company and because it is new it hasnt reported. That said, generally I do not like to buy IPO's or new company's until at least 1 report. Full disclosure I have traded CLOV ever since the report around 12 and such. Even last few days. Tomorrow I am hoping I get start an entry and 10.50 or if I must 10.65-10.75. My objective 25-50 cents. if you want to hold this longer it is probably a safe trade to 12. But their is going to be alot of turbulence as their is a cloud over this and remember I am mainly a day trader, sometimes a swing trader\n\nGood luck everyone and lets make MONEY!

{"title": "Most people are better off with ETFs, but individual stocks and higher risk plays can be a solid investment strategy too", "selftext": "It’s hard to argue with the logic that ETFs / low cost funds are probably the best bet for most investors, if not all. But the key point is here - over the long term. While they should absolutely form the backbone of a long term investing portfolio, and it’s important to recognise we’re in a raging bull market, I think it’s also important to acknowledge that this strategy is primarily about the gradual accumulation of wealth. It can be used in conjunction with a strategy that embraces higher risk for higher reward. To make that wealth. \n\nIt doesn’t mean that ETFs shouldn’t be at the core of a portfolio, it just means it’s also okay to get involved in more speculative plays, try to swing trade sentiment etc.\n\nThey key factors to consider are:\n\n- don’t go all in on risky trades\n\n- do DD. Consider the bear case for every bull case\n\n- make a thesis on the direction of a stock. Consider throughout the “why?”, and be clear on your goals\n\n- set clear price points for taking profits, and for getting into a stock. Don’t buy in at all-time highs unless it supports your thesis for future growth. Don’t “diamond hands” a volatile stock into being worth nothing\n\n- being right too early is the same as being wrong. You face opportunity cost with your money tied up, and you could see a stock bleed further. \n\n- averaging down is a sensible strategy for good stocks, not a way to try and dilute the loss from FOMOing into a speculative stock during an all-time high.\n\nThe focus should still be on adding money into ETFs / funds, rather than trying to play the lottery with all of the savings account / pay cheque, but it can absolutely be a solid play to pick individual stocks for the higher risk / higher reward potential.

They want instant settlement and dark pools on the open market. This is their game plan. This would allow them to hold less for settlement and use more of their money to fuck you over! It would also give them more access in taking on the bigger fish by getting rid of dark pools. I imagine there are some pension funds etc that also use dark pools. This is all their narrative to help them become bigger fish! Note Vlad didn’t like 1 day settlement.\n\nThird, there was one question about the danger of options trades. The congressman who asked is on my shitlist. However during the hearing RH disclosed how they’ve made 5x more money since allowing options i.e. its likely they’ve been fucking over your options trades.\n\nFourth, this liquidity problem was made up behind closed doors! They made up this problem so they didn’t have to perjur themselves. Evidence of this is THE MOST important question was asked by David Houstoff of TN, if it wasn’t for the settlement time this wouldn’t have happened? \nVlad is a shitty liar and sidestepped slightly by not fully answering, he said it would avoid some of the problems. I.e. they never had an intention of letting this trade go through even without this “crisis”.\n\nFive, these asshats keep acting like Vlad speaks for retail, yet DFV is literally at the hearing?! Like WTF! \n\nSix, why ask these corrupt fucks for ANY suggestions? They used it to advertise, act as if they care about retail, and push their wish list.\n\nSeventh, very important, when citadel was asked about the DTCC he looked to the left during his response. Clear sign of lying, but speculation I guess. \n\nLastly, Melvin sounded like a little bitch and his office looked empty. He seems like a bit of a tool but mostly answered questions and openly admitted to making a program to monitor us. Haha he’s a sore loser 😂 \n\n\nSo please, contact your congressman and address these concerns you have, likely if they aren’t on the shitlist? At least, if you feel that giving citadel more free money to move the markets via real time settlement is a bad idea. \n\nLastly, the shitlist, note I have some on the fence but some are also here because the later the hearing went the less it seems important to ask Vlad the same bullshit questions.

I think it'll hold, **HOWEVER, don't be surprised IF** we see a dip below that, there's still 1.5MILLION short exempts out there too for some more top-notch-fuckery.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0mvwewrwtdi61.png?width=1177&format=png&auto=webp&s=63afe390bff3bb0536093eee35f1301c94dc77fb\n\n=============================================\n\nFor PLTR, the short exempt volume **hit a new high Thursday for this year**, and the short volumes from **FINRA and NASDAQ PSX both climbed!**\n\n\\--->  **THIS IS USUALLY A BAD SIGN!!!**\n\n* See how the yellow line, off-exchange numbers from FINRA, dipped Wednesday, then went higher than Tuesdays!???\n* And the bright blue(teal?) line is at its highest now, that's short exempts, which I have a personal history with because they usually shit themselves in elevators and walk out!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6fr1g0utmdi61.png?width=761&format=png&auto=webp&s=b50125d21b35979a5d23d433a7219621541b9afa\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/twodqlhxtdi61.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8e438aa5b7ef493f266c99f47c6cf0e0eef1586\n\nI think we're going to see some real volatility tomorrow, down to $23 and if it can't hold there, then down to $22, AND PLEASE DEAR GOD MAKE IT THE FLOOR!\n\n==============================\n\nI believe, like many of you, that these two are are WAY UNDERVALUED! I've read estimates for TLRY to $60, and PLTR to $70, but you're reading this now, so who the hell knows!\n\n==============================\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR: DON'T TRUST STRANGERS ONLINE!**\n\n* Not financial advice, but **BUY THE FUCKING DIP!!!!!!**\n* **TLRY** shorts look like they've finally beaten the hell out of it and their volumes fell Wednesday, but they also went up slightly Thursday, maybe preparing for another incoming dip, unclear at this point.\n   * **Still might beat it down to $ 25 tomorrow** and if it gets down anywhere near $20 expect a rubberband in the future, and I'm trading in all my crayola's to buy in.\n* **PLTR** has **gone down 5 days in a row BUT THE SHORT VOLUME HAS REMAINED HIGH?!** and the short exempt volume is the highest for all of 2021!\n   * **PLTR isn't done falling,** and **short exempt volumes can drag out recovery.**\n   * If that shit falls anywhere near $23 I'm selling my good kidney to get in there!\n   * (**CHARLIE IN THE MAIN ROOM RANT**) IF THE SHORT EXEMPT VOLUMES GO DOWN tomorrow, expect a rise next Monday and Tuesday.

Co. Ltd.) currently sits with a market cap of $588.98B. $ON is at $16.70B.  TSMC's hegemony over the semiconductor market is hardly surprising, considering that it makes silicon for industry bigwigs such as Apple, Nvidia, and AMD and soon to be INTEL as well.\n\nWell - that was the case - until biden steps in and starts giving incentives to use US semi's and gives companies like $ON $$$$ to expand production capabilities.   Thats a lot of potential clients and revenue.\n\nLONG - this company will do very well.\n\nSHORT TERM - it will see steady growth.
