{"title": "Why I am bearish on BB (technical analysis)", "selftext": "I'm a Software Eng. and therefore will only cover the technical aspects. As you might already see in the title, I'm bearish on BB. I decided to share my thoughts, since a lot of people (and analysts) seem to overvalue the potential growth of the stock.I want to give a quick and **very abstract** introduction on technical terms:\n\n# Technicalities\n\nBB's QNX is a commercial Unix-like operating system, aimed primarily at the embedded systems market. In other words QNX can be run as a base on probably everything that is considered a computer ([IOT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)), since it's Unix-like nature. [According to BB](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en) it powers train controls, ventilators, automation systems etc.\n\nWhy would someone use QNX? According to BB because it is [save](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications), secure, scalable and reliable. Focusing on cars (because that's what everyone talks about in this context, especially after the AWS news) a car manufacturer could implement QNX as the OS and on top of that develop everything else - for example the GUI, an app-store etc.\n\nHowever some, in fact most of the biggest car manufacturers, already developed or about to develop their own OS. Why? Only they know. [It's a common problem in the IT industry](https://xkcd.com/927/).\n\n# Contra BB (QNX):\n\nThe following car manufacturers are [the biggest in the world](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/company-insights/091516/most-profitable-auto-companies-2016-tm-gm.asp):\n\n1. Toyota\n2. VW\n3. Daimler\n4. Ford\n5. Honda\n6. BMW\n7. GM\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. [Toyota ditched QNX](https://www.obj.ca/article/blackberry-qnx-defensive-over-loss-toyota-open-source-linux-software) for [AML](https://www.automotivelinux.org/about/) (Linux).\n2. [Volkswagen ditched QNX](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/volkswagen-audi-porsche-vw-group-plans-one-os-to-rule-them-all/) and develops [vw.os](https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2019/06/volkswagen-with-new-software-unit.html) (Linux), which will be implemented across **all Volkswagens, Audis and Porsches**. Other car manufacturers, which are part of the VW group, that is Skoda, Seat, Lamborghini, Bugatti, **Skania, MAN** etc. are not confirmed so far, but I'm sure they will follow.\n3. Daimler ditched QNX for [MBUX](https://www.mercedes-benz.com/en/innovation/connected/mbux-mercedes-benz-user-experience-revolution-in-the-cockpit/) (Linux). Although the t[erm MBUX seems to refer to more than just the OS](https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/At-a-glance-The-key-data-on-MBUX.xhtml?oid=32705799). every new Mercedes build since 2018 comes with MBUX instead of QNX.\n4. [Ford just dropped QNX this week](https://www.obj.ca/article/techopia/ford-drops-blackberry-qnx-infotainment-platform-inks-deal-google) and will use Google's [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) instead.\n5. Honda seems to stay with QNX.\n6. [BMW ditched QNX](https://www.drwindows.de/news/11641-unsichtbare-dritte-marktueberblick-ueber-connected-car-betriebssysteme) and uses iDrive (Linux), although it seems that QNX is still working under the hood.\n7. [GM ditched QNX](https://www.autonews.com/article/20141104/OEM06/141109954/gm-to-roll-out-android-cars-in-2016-supplier-says?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) a few years ago and uses, just like Ford, Android.\n\nI didn't research the other car manufacturers, because the trend seems clear to me. Feel free to research them and let me know what you come up with. For anyone curious about Tesla, [it looks like they use Linux/Android.](https://www.tesla.com/de_DE/careers/search/job/embedded-softwareengineerlinuxplatforms-45034?redirect=no)\n\n# Pro BB (QNX):\n\nDeveloping an [entire os isn't as easy as developing some software](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-vw-daimler-id3-software-problems/) (especially security compliance is a huge deal).\n\n# Conclusion\n\nIn my opinion BB is overhyped. QNX is being ditched by pretty much most of the car manufacturers and the trend in the car industry [seems to be Linux, instead of Unix](https://www.pymnts.com/ecosystems/2018/ford-daimler-volvo-connected-cars/).\n\nFurthermore I just searched through job listings for \"QNX\" and found only 16 positions across Germany and the only car manufacturer out of that pool being Daimler (still need to maintain older cars that run QNX I suppose).\n\nAlthough Volkswagen had problems in the past when developing vw.os, other manufactures such as Daimler did excellent and MBUX is regarded as the best (infotainment system) there is as of right now.\n\nLet me hear your thoughts!", "id": "ld4efn", "created_utc": 1612520728.0, "score": 75, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "num_comments": 67, "comments": [{"body": "OP you are misleading and misinforming everyone.

I especially like the survey of manufacturers and the approach.\n\nUnfortunately I'm not sure of the factual accuracy of some of these points.\n\nFirst, as to QNX.  It is first and foremost a microkernel-based real-time operating system.  It provides a POSIX userland which is where the \"Unix-like\" bit comes in.  Linux, on the other hand, is a monolithic general-purpose operating system.  \"Linux instead of Unix\" therefore doesn't even make sense as a statement in this context.\n\nI've gotten that floppy demo before.  See if you can get your hands on it.  It had a GUI, including Web browser and other fancy things.  Very impressive.  By that point the Linux *kernel* would barely fit on a floppy, IIRC.\n\nFocusing on whose infotainment system people like the UI of seems like a red herring here.\n\nQNX would let you build the vehicle operation and the entertainment on the same platform, even the same hardware (though you might still want to isolate them).  Or you could use QNX or something else suitable for critical systems and Linux/Android for irrelevant bits.  I don't know that you'd want to use Linux for the brakes without lots of extra hardening, testing, and certification.\n\nFrom what I heard Tesla uses Ubuntu and their remote management is apparently cobbled together and about to fall over.  That sounds insane so it could be baseless libel, but I've heard it from several independent supposed former Tesla employees.\n\nAre you familiar with, e.g., MISRA when discussing automotive applications?\n\nThen, critical/validated systems have many extra process requirements people don't think about when doing random consumer software (I argue they should, but that's a discussion for another time).  Many find them overwhelming, but in all honesty the standards I've seen (general and medical) are fairly flexible, only making you state at each step why you think the thing will actually work.  That doesn't seem like an unfair imposition.\n\nAs for \"ditching QNX for Android\", I think I saw a note the other day that Google and BlackBerry are collaborating on Android/QNX, specifically for auto applications.  Regarding Ford specifically, someone pointed out they hired hundreds of QNX engineers, haven't fired them, and may still be hiring.  Granted they could be indecisive and sloppy, but that's a big investment.\n\nDon't have links handy since I'm in a hurry but feel free to look into those (and feel free to amend/correct).\n\nI'm long BB but I'm also bullish on quality engineering and proper classification.  I also like QNX but just from what I've read and played with; haven't developed on/for it.  Free software is preferable --- especially, I believe, for safety-critical applications --- but I don't know of solid free software or open source real-time operating systems.\n\nP.S.

In other words, once they get in a product stream they will probably be difficult to remove / replace. Major companies realize this and thus want to limit their exposure to the cost risks associated with relying on a third party vendor. The problem I see is even tech companies have a hard time dealing with tech. How likely is it that a someplace like GM, a notoriously backward looking company, is going to able to build a fast, scalable, secure, cyber platform for their products and keep it up to date? Maybe they can, maybe the cant, but its a pretty valid question and holds for many companies, large and small.\n\nAdditionally, this is exactly one market (automobiles). The intent behind the BB cyber suite it to provide a comprehensive, tailorable, scalable set of tools for anyone that makes a product. You want to make a toothbrush with bluetooth? Are you going to create a set of cyber tools from scratch to protect it? Or is it more likely you'd just buy an off the shelf product? To those saying why put cyber on such a device, I respond you may be required to do so. Several decades of unsecure device manufacture has resulted in a literal zombie army of connected machines for criminals and scriptkiddies to make modern networked life a nuisance at best and dangerous at worst. Its never a good idea to bet on legislation, but its definitely a possibility and even if it never comes to pass its highly likely to become part of Standards or Regulations.\n\nIn the end, I see BB as a Microsoft or Shopify type company in the cyber realm. A business that helps facilitate other businesses. Now those are big comparisons and even if BB gets to that level it will not be over night, but that's why the stock is <$20 a share.

I loved the part where you mentioned that you like looking for some negative in a stock like Netflix announcing the plan to break apart the streaming and DVD service, AMD etc and then buying LEAPS at that time. I will continue to look for those opportunities.\n\n2. I also saw you're looking at QYLD as well but that you sold it. I heard there were some weird tax consequences though. Someone that recommended it to me mentioned that as well.\n\n3. I would like to know more about what you plan to do to use your investment to make you more cash beyond selling covered calls (although that's a good one). Or perhaps that's all you really need, right? \n\nOverall: I think people will call you lucky without hearing your story and sure there is a certain degree of luck involved e.g. selling your calls in Jan 2020 before COVID and then going back in for more calls but other than that it was just looking for an opportunity to go long with calls.\n\nTo confirm, you sold 70 1600c 1/22/2022 calls for $160 each for $800k+ and I just checked and it looks like those are $96 now. Have you considered just buying them back now and waiting for the next TSLA price rise?\n\nAll I'm doing right now is selling weekly covered calls but it is very time consuming. e.g. I sold 2/12 985c - 1035c in the middle of the day on Friday when it went to $860 a share and after it dropped back to $850 I saw that the value of those calls had already gone down 55%. So I decided to just close those right away and see if there's a nice green day on Monday or Tuesday when I can sell my next set. Overall, I made like $1800 from that trade and I bought 2 more shares of TSLA.\n\nI'm also selling naked puts on TSLA as well but I do those 30 - 45 days out as I'd prefer not to be assigned the shares. I use the margin available on my account to pay for the shares if I were assigned but I would likely buy back (at a loss if I had to) in the event of a catastrophic macro event or some other thing. I've got 5 right now for instance.\n\nBy the way, Interactive Brokers isn't the only company that does the share income lending program. There are a lot out there and even WeBull does it and they pay daily but it’s my understanding that TSLA isn’t in as much demand now as other companies. e.g. I leant out LMND shares a few weeks ago for 80% which dropped to 40% then 25% etc. and then the shares were given back to me. So it was only like 7 days or something.\n\nI'm at 3,554 shares right now with only like 2 short term calls.

I know everyone still has their panties in a bunch over $GME and $AMC, but shockingly there are other stocks in the market.

It provides over 250+ television channels and boasts perhaps one of the largest collections of sports channels. Apes from all over can watch their favorites from football to cricket (I hear that's popular with some crayon eaters abroad).\n\nNow, you're probably thinking, \"So what?

When I heard they were creating another way for a retard like myself to risk money, I felt a tiny tingle in my flesh flavored bean bag. Other sports betting companies like Penn Gaming and Draftkings are trading higher comparatively, and streaming platforms like ROKU are on another planet. This thing has room for growth.\n\nNow the icing on the cake is that this news didn't come out until AFTER a large number of individuals decided to short **$FUBO** stock. It has a 73% short interest float since January 15th. Short interest volume was 31% today. So this stock does have the potential for a bit of the ole squeeeeeze. But that shouldn't be the reason you retards invest in this company.
