{"title": "If You Don‚Äôt Know Whether The GME Squeeze Has Squoze, You‚Äôre Right", "selftext": "(Disclaimer - this was a reply I posted in a previous thread - you may have already Reddit. Also not a financial advisor do your own DD)\n_____________________\n\nTo those who think the squeeze has squoze and those who have not. You‚Äôre both right \n\nTo state the obvious, last week Hedge funds were caught completely off guard and there was a massive massive gamma squeeze / short seller meltdown which crescendoed Thursday morning. \n\nMany are looking to the next short report to determine how squozen we truly are. Do not place too much faith in the 2/9 short report. It won‚Äôt tell you much imo. \n\nWhy? We sat at 100% short interest for 6 months+ with no squeeze. Squeezes require catalysts and multiple catalysts are in play at the moment. \n\nSo how do you determine if HF and others are still massively short? \n\nOne Answer: check your own broker. Can you short the stock? Are there shares available? If cost to borrow is over 15% and/or there are no shares available - it‚Äôs a crowded short no matter what the report says. You can likely check on the weekends too. \n\nThe current rate on IBKR is 3.7% and there are 800k shares available to borrow. This rate is lower than the previous average of ~20%. Shares available to borrow  have been anywhere from 0 to 1 million.  So IBKR to me indicates some potential covering and slightly less squeeze potential. \n\nBut also keep in mind, if the short report says 44% of the float is short - this is still insanely high and about 2x what I would consider a crowded idea (20% is crowded imo). So don‚Äôt be fooled into thinking the covering is over even if short interest dips to lower levels. \n\nTo me it feels like Old Wall wants the price down. Why? I‚Äôm not sure exactly. But even the dreamers on Twitter who have spent the past year pumping Tesla think GME is a bubble. Lol. People thought the Tesla bubble popped last year in Feb when it peaked at $968.99 (pre split, so actually $190 versus $850 today.  Again. People thought the Tesla bubble popped at $190.)\n\nAs for GME, Hedgeye had a $100pt. Citron covered and is scared to short. Lots of other hedgies will probabaly never pile in short to this name lest they have to explain to investors why they were burned twice. \n\nI don‚Äôt think RC bought at $16, risked locking up his money for a long time, simply to EaRN 5 pECEnT PeR YEar. \n\nInsiders haven‚Äôt sold except for one. Company hasn‚Äôt sold and is instead pumping the news flow up with Amazon hires. DFV was in at $4. He could have sold at $60 and have still been a legend.\n\nDr. Burry is currently - as recently as last night - been tweeting about Gamma squeezes. \n\nSo let‚Äôs not pretend like any of us know exactly what‚Äôs going on. But uncertainty creates opportunity. \n\nIf everyone knew we were going to squeeze again, the price would be much much higher and you wouldn‚Äôt be able to buy at these levels. \n\nThis is still a highly volatile situation. In my opinion, the risks are extremely high both ways but I would be terrified to be short right now. \n\nMainstream media‚Äôs mis-reporting of GMEs prospects, literal trading suppression by brokerages, threats of investigations, etc - if you just think about it - can only be doing one thing which is holding the price down. \n\nSo to the extent GME is being manipulated at all, it‚Äôs very much to the downside imho. \n\nWhile it‚Äôs frustrating to be misunderstood by big media, big Twitter - whatever. In the end, it literally will not matter. \n\nThe ball spiking that CNBC did to Elon and TSLA while they were down - may have felt good at the time to them. But boy did it cost them in the long run. \n\nAnd it‚Äôs not like CNBC made a mistake and then changed course overnight. They tried to FUD Tesla into oblivion through the entirety of 2020 while the price ripped in their face relentlessly. And then ripped some more. And some more. Sound familiar?\n\nThis suppression can be reversed explosively with:\n\nMore Insider Buying\nNew Insider Buying\nStrategic Partnerships\nEarnings Beat\nMore short covering \nPossible Gamma Squeeze Round 2 (I think unlikely)\nRC memes\n\n\nSpeaking of Gamma squeezes - and I would love some fact checking on this - but I think one of the reasons we cannot repeat is because deep OOTM ($800) calls now exist. MM can hedge with those rather than only through purchasing shares which they had to do when every call written was a Delta 1, thus very in the money. \n\nBut finally - an investment thesis that relies on a squeeze is not much of a thesis. It‚Äôs really a combination of A) the market realizing fundamental value is much higher all at once .... which causes B) forced short covering with limited exit paths. \n\nVW squeezed for purely non fundamental reasons and it came back down to earth.  I firmly believe GME ‚Äúsqueezed‚Äù for fundamental reasons which could make this rally far more sustainable. Again, see Tesla. \n\nJust take a look at RC, e commerce valuations, and the types of $$ GME is doing. There‚Äôs value here. \n\nOther than all that. I have no opinion on the matter.

I agree that the SI report will be about the same magnitude (I'm projecting between 54 and 89mil), if you look at the short volume vs. total volume through January up to yesterday the ratio held steady all the way through the squeeze. That means just as many new short positions were being opened as those closing. And that's a TON of money now just sitting dormant for them since we've already tanked. Sure GME could go to $20, but there is a limit to downside potential. GME is no longer a candidate for short pressure into bankruptcy, so they're going to close up and go fish in a different pond once this dies down. Given the large short interest, that has the same effect as 50+ million shares bought as a long term holding.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "This is the reason ive been holding on to my shares.\n\nSure, Old shorts may have closed and new shorts opened in the $200-$450 range. Those new shorts dont actually lock in any gains until they cover. With all of the potential catalysts and a large number of shorts, it doesnt make a lot of sense for new shorts to dig in to their positions for max gain. Kinda like how my dumbass bought in at $21.50, rode it up to $500, never sold--- And rode it all the way back down to $50.... I never locked in gains... New shorts stand to lose more than they gain by not covering at this price point...\n\nFor example, if shorts opened at $450, and the price is now $50, they are sitting on $400 profit per share... They could theoretically make another $50 maximum if GME goes to 0... But they could also lose their $400/share gains if GME has any catalyst or other shorts decide to cover first. \n\nI suspect we see more covering next week as shorts lock in gains.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "That's it!
