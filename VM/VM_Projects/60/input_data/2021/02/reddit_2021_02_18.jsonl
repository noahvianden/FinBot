There are also talks about TSMC building a US fab.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, to further point out some important facts here,\n\nAMD has a revolutionary \"chiplet\" design that is extremely scaleable. For high core count CPUs, AMD's cost is considerably cheaper than Intel's, which uses a difficult to manufacture monolithic Die with low yields. Intel does have a new CEO which looks like they may become more competitive in the future, but here is the thing;\n\nAMD is so far ahead in technical innovation when compared to Intel. For Intel to compete, they need to have some important innovations, which takes time and manpower. \n\nAMD has Lisa Su, and as long as she is CEO, I have no doubt AMD will be able to innovate at a faster pace than intel while simultaneously entering new industries and leveraging their CPU and GPU divisions in a way their competitors simply can't.\n\nDisclaimer; I've been holding AMD since Lisa Su became their CEO and currently have a position in AMD", "score": 14, "replies": []}, {"body": "I like the stock.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "Your thesis is that AMD is undervalued. Your argument relies on the comparison to INTEL, who you claim is the main competitor and antagonist.\n\nYour understanding of value is flawed. Let's look at the basics.\n\nRevenue\n\n\\- Intel: $ 78 billion\n\n\\- AMD: $ 10 billion\n\nIncome\n\n\\- Intel: $ 21 billion\n\n\\- AMD: $2.5 billion\n\nCash\n\n\\- Intel: $ 6 billion\n\n\\- AMD: $ 1.6 billion\n\nPrice to Earnings\n\n\\- Intel: 12\n\n\\- AMD: 43\n\nBy the last metric alone, your argument is proven wrong. In fact, the exact opposite of what you are proposing is true. INTEL makes twice in net income (profit) compared to what AMD makes in only *revenue*. Think about that. When everything is paid for, INTEL has $21 billion left over to use as they please. What would it take to get AMD to a $100 billion valuation based on these number? Some unrealistic gains in market share and new business sectors. INTEL is the current value play and is severely undervalued. \n\nYou also miss the mark by evaluating a small sector of INTEL's business. Their operating segments rake in revenue well beyond the limited chipset market. AMD is almost solely chipsets. They mention \"development services and licenses for intellectual property\" as a passing side note, of little significance.\n\nWhat you should be arguing is that AMD is a growth stock. Their potential is what you and many others are hyped about. This is great. They do have lots of room to grow and their architecture improvements are pushing technology forward. But expectations need to remain realistic. Their current valuation is not undervalued - if anything it's already overbought.\n\nI've made this argument multiple times over the previous years. Look year-over-year and the numbers tell the story.

Further, if you read into their SEC filings you’d see that they are going to expand into different markets and (you guessed it) will start to take market share from their competitors. \n\nPositions: AMD 7/16 $95C bought during the dip today when it bounced off the 100SMA", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Do you work at INTEL?
