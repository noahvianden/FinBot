{"title": "The stock market is basically random", "selftext": "So I was talking to my wife’s friend (who is currently living with us) last night about stocks and comparing our portfolios. Honestly, he does a little bit of swing trading but for the most part, he is doing a very good job of HODL-ing.\n\nFor the smooth brains out there, **HODL** does not stand for “how often Danielle lies“ (fuck you, Dani). It stands for, **“Hold On for Dear Life“.** The concept is this: the stock market is basically random, but with a general bias towards growth over time. Have you ever heard of tensegrity? Each moving part holds the other moving parts together. Various investments have various levels of risk, and your rate of return has an associated standard deviation where you are most likely to receive a return within a certain range.  (Technically, the 2008 market crash was within three standard deviations for the S&P 500 predicted rate of return that year, FWIW).\n\nStudies and the data support passive investing. There's no evidence to support active management in the long run, especially speculative trading. In fact, human psychology makes it very likely this strategy of active trading will lose you money because you want to sell to “preserve what you still have” at the expense of what might very well be one of the best days in the stock market the following day. \n\nSo what recommend? \n\nReacting *will* hurt performance. Stay disciplined **(HODL)**. Missing only a few days of strong returns can drastically impact your overall portfolio's performance. At a minimum, keep your active trading to only a small portion of your entire investment portfolio. \n\nSell puts on companies and ETFs you believe in, but avoid credit spreads and all that other black magic option fuckery.  Leveraged funds really don't offer a wild rate of return for free (the super-wide standard deviation for ROR on TQQQ is a huge risk). All of the financial studies and historical data suggest you will have more time (and money) to “bang the ladies“ if you just do passive investing. \n\nWhile I am at it, the studies also support investing with a biased towards Small Caps over Large Caps, and Value over Growth.  Throw in a few bonds and international equities for shits and giggles. You're on your way to 10% ROR per year for a standard deviation risk of only 13%. \n\nNot financial advice. So don't listen to me. \n\nGood luck out there everyone. Here is a picture of tensegrity.\n\n[ Tensegrity, tensional integrity or floating compression is a structural principle based on a system of isolated components under compression inside a network of continuous tension, and arranged in such a way that the compressed members \\(usually bars or struts\\) do not touch each other while the prestressed tensioned members \\(usually cables or tendons\\) delineate the system spatially. ](https://preview.redd.it/22gcd0ae2xr71.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4d8c0279cbdbf59d946b6b41511cf906c20ac74)", "id": "q2wjlj", "created_utc": 1633564026.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.56, "num_comments": 66, "comments": [{"body": "Your wife's friend...aka boyfriend", "score": 82, "replies": [{"body": "#what if he’s a fuck ugly fatty tho", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Ask your mother.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I have 2 dads", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Whichever one opens his penis up to accept the others penis is the feminine dad.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Oh you must mean the non binary one his name is Brenda", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "It's nice that you let your wife's boyfriend move in, saves on gas.\n\nHODL is based on a misspelling of 'holding' on a kryptoe forum long ago, rather than actually being an acronym for anything.\n\nObviously 'Hold On for Dear Life' works, but isn't historically accurate.\n\nI'll agree that there is ample opportunity to lose money by being an active trader, especially if you're a shitty one.
