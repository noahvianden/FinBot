{"title": "Netflix Posts Higher 3Q Profit, Sales on Rise of New Subscribers", "selftext": "DOW JONES & COMPANY,  INC. 1:13 PM ET 10/19/2021\n\nNetflix Inc. (NFLX) said it added more subscribers than it  predicted in the latest quarter as profit and revenue rose thanks to the return  of popular series and new hits.\n\nThe Los Gatos,  Calif.-based streaming company said third-quarter profit increased to  $1.45 billion from $790 million a year earlier.  Per-share earnings were $3.19 a share, compared with  $1.74 a share last year, topping GAAP earnings estimates of  $2.56 a share, according to FactSet.\n\nRevenue rose to $7.48 billion from $6.44  billion a year earlier and was in line with analysts' expectations.\n\nThe streaming service said it added roughly **4.4** million memberships in the  third quarter.   The new additions bring Netflix's(NFLX) total paid global subscriber base  to 213.6 million\n\nIt had previously forecast it would add 3.5 million memberships.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) also said it would change how it discloses  viewership information. It currently reports on the number of accounts that  watched at least two minutes of a show. Going forward, it will instead pivot to  hours viewed for its titles.\n\n Netflix (NFLX) earlier this year said it would make its own  video games, part of an effort to expand into new revenue streams. The company  said the games would be made for mobile devices, and some of them may feature  characters from Netflix(NFLX) shows and movies. The games will be  included at no extra cost to Netflix(NFLX) members.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "qblmvr", "created_utc": 1634679461.0, "score": 261, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 64, "comments": [{"body": "I just assumed we all were using the same login.", "score": 126, "replies": [{"body": "Two family members use my login lol", "score": 21, "replies": []}, {"body": "I really can’t believe Netflix and even Hulu and HBO have been so lenient on shared logins for this long.

There is simply too much cash in the economy (thanks to the Fed’s eight trillion in printing and backing of the junk bond market since 2012) Netflix Ponzi’s their bond payments have for a decade.
