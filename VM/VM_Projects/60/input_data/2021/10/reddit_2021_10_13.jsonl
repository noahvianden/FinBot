So with 5 mil. delivered cars it’s P/E 64. That is if they are able to deliver 6 times more cars without decrease in average selling price, which is near impossible. If we take VW ASP, we are still above 100 P/E. We start to get reasonable at 20 mil. cars, which is DOUBLE of largest automakers today. And starts to get reasonable is really relative, since it would have P/E if 25, while European automakers are at 5-7.  \n\nTL;DR - Tesla would have to make 2 times more cars than any automaker in the world to still have 4 times as high P/E", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "You take forward deliveries but not forward PE?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "u/tupcek Now I had some minutes to crunch the numbers for you.\n\nAnalyst 2022 EPS range from $7-10.
