AWS -- very profitable for Amazon and continuing to grow at double digit rates -- not to mention extremely profitable to the bottom line of AMZN.\n3. Advertising revenue --- now is becoming nearly an $8 billion dollar growth revenue moat, per quarter, for Amazon. You have to figure that this is essentially a net gain to the bottom line for the company. \n4. Logistics --- Amazon working to directly compete with the like of UPS and FedEx. \n5. Gaming --- Amazon working to launch more and more games. (They launched \"New World\" and it is doing very well, thus far, on Twitch). \n6. Prime Memberships --- over 200 million paying customers. If they were to raise the monthly fee, by even a dollar, that would add another $2.4 billion to the bottom line.\n7. Amazon Prime Video --- over 175 Million users of their prime video app, which is expected to grow, not to mention they are pushing, even bigger than they currently are, into content. (Working to buy MGM barring regulatory approval and, given their close relationship with Viacom, could build, virtually overnight, a media empire). \n8. I could go on and on with Twitch, Pillpack, Whole Foods, Rivian and self driving, Alexa, Physical Stores, Partnerships, etc...\n\nAll these reasons, and more, are the reason I don't sell Amazon, ever. I keep a little bit of cash on the sideline, always, and keenly watch Amazon and Google. Those are two names that are just to powerful to sell, in my view anyway.\n\nBTW: If the growth rates continue then AWS and The Advertising Aspect of Amazon could both, separate of the core E-Commerce business, fortune 50 companies.

{"title": "$SOFI - A Retard's Retirement Paradise", "selftext": "SOFI has been an undoubted major disruptor in the FinTech industry over the past 3 years. Going into 2022, SoFi has an **ENORMOUS** amount of wind behind its’ sails. Here are my top 3 reasons why:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Currently, SoFi makes approximately 75% of its working revenue from its loans business. However, to grow the lending business, **SoFi needs a bank charter.** A bank charter will enable the company to take member deposits and use those to make loans, which vastly expands their profit margins and increases the number and kinds of products they can offer. On March 9th, SoFi announced its decision to acquire Bancorp Pacific. This decision will enable the company to execute its mission and remain in a profitable hyper-growth mode for many years to come.\n   * **Retard Translation:** If SoFi can secure a bank charter, their available loanable cash will increase significantly, greatly upping the largest source of their current profits.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* SoFi is simply borrowing $1.078B interest-free with repayment scheduled in October 2026. If the stock price goes above $22.41, the loan can convert to common equity (44.61 shares for every $1000). What this means is if the shares price rises 40% from today's level in the next five years, the company can (and likely will) issue an additional 48.1M shares (calculated as $1,078,000,000 in new money, divided by $22.41 = 48,103,525 shares) to bondholders who will convert their loan to common equity. **However,** it gets slightly better. SoFi will use $104.3 million of the net proceeds to buy capped calls on the number of shares of SoFi's common stock underlying the convertible notes. The cap price of the capped call transactions will initially be $32.02 per share and will result in an effective note conversion price (from SoFi's perspective) of $32.02. That means that the dilution in 2026 would be closer to 4%.\n   * **Retard Translation:** SoFi has recently borrowed an interest free \\~$billion dollars with which it can eventually convert outstanding debt to shares given an appropriate increase in underlying stock price. (This move would effectively double the loan, on which the company already pays virtually 0 interest) Additionally, the company will use \\~10% of these funds to buy covered calls on outstanding shares against convertible notes: further leveraging the company’s debt against its growth. As the company grows, their access to free re-investable cash will only increase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The 2022 Super Bowl will be held at SoFi stadium. This will bring millions upon millions of potential new users. This is all not even to mention the 2028 Olympics, which will also be held at SoFi stadium. Need I say more?\n   * **Retard Translation:** Billions of people advertised to via the hosting of major sports tournaments at SoFi stadium = Millions of potential members (currently around 3m total)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Go look at it yourself.** There are lots of moving parts, but the key point to take away from the deal and our commentary is that SOFI seems to be doing this deal from a position of strength, effectively raising money today at a 40% premium to today’s prices. The dilution of 5.6% is not too bad considering the proceeds represent over 8% of the total market cap at today’s value. On top of that, the capped calls will help them reduce dilution even further to somewhere around 4% by our estimates. **The company literally bought $100m in calls on itself. LONG $SOFI.** I haven't even mentioned the acquisition of Galileo or partnership with Pagaya: Both of which will enable SoFi toutilize artificial intelligence to offer consumers more robust access to financial products outside the existing traditional credit models. Specifically, Pagaya’s machine learning models are designed to reduce risk for lenders and help better inform credit decisioning. Pagaya’s ongoing growth includes entering new markets that span personal loans, auto loans, single-family residences, credit cards, point-of-sale financing and more. Galileo’s digital payments platform enable critical checking and savings account-like functionality via its powerful open APIs, providing companies with an easy way to create sophisticated consumer and B2B financial services. Both companies' partnerships with SoFi are the largest deployment of their technology in the fintech marketplace to date.\n\n**I have nearly all of my liquid assets in this stock.
