Chinese government, through state grid, is standardizing swapping stations across the country. Given how congested big cities are, even a 10 minute charge can create a lot of bottlenecks. A 2 minute battery swap is much more efficient. And if swapping isn’t a good option, BaaS is still a competitive.

So they have either charging station or swap station. \n\nAnd whether to rent or to buy depends on the specifics. If we take NIO as an example, an EC6 is around 52,000$. If an owner chooses baas 39000$. It takes about 6 years before you break even. But that’s part of the story. EC6 with battery doesn’t qualify for (part of) subsidy as it’s expensive, but EC6 without battery does. That adds another year of rent. Now math with interest rate gets a little tricky, but battery as a service should really be around 8-9 years to break even if people do take a loan. For people who buy NIO, I am confident that 10 years is the normal lifespan before they would get a new one. Obviously, NIO would make a little more money with this option in long term, but then customers also get different benefits. \n\nBut again, you are always free to buy the battery.
