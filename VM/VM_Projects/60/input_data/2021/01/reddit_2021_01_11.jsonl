{"title": "DD $SRPT Outlook", "selftext": "Ok assholes and fucksticks, sit down and listen about the story of a stock called $SRPT, a stock that lost half its stock price after a single phase 2 study report.\n\nLet me start off by giving a bit of background on the study that just gave us the sexiest dip of 2021 so far. Currently Sarepta Therapeutics is engaged in several different drug and disease group projects, with it's main other competitor being Daddy Pfizer. Pfizer is currently competing against Sarepta to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Both companies are developing several drugs to combat this disease which most affects boys around the age 3 and continues to quickly decrease their muscle tone until they are in their teens and presented with a complete loss of ambulation, which eventually leads to heart and lung problems and eventually most of those diagnosed die within their 20's to early 30's. Currently Sarepta is working in 3 main areas of pharmacology Gene Editing, Gene Therapy, and RNA Tech. This study concerned Gene Therapy, where a healthy genetic code is inserted into the body and starts producing whatever the subject's previously flawed genetic code wasn't able to produce. For Duchenne's it is protein fibers that compose muscle. The thing about gene therapy is its a single time medication, a one and done. Once these kids have a dose their DNA contains the appropriate genetics and can produce the proteins. No long term therapies, no daily medications, just injection and improvement.\n\nAll parts of this paragraph are referring to the genetic therapy treatment called SRP-9001. So in Phase 1 of this study (Trial 101) they found that the kids had a high rate of success of protein synthesis after injection, and it was maintained years after injection, a huge success, but that is a highly controlled study without a placebo group, and among a small group of kids. The study that just dropped last week was Trial 102. Trial 102 was Phase 2, and looking for long term sustainability and safety with a larger group of kids, the study did not find enough evidence to prove the therapy was more effective than a placebo, however it was rated as safe, something which Pfizer has had difficulty with in their treatment (more on that later, fuck you I'm writing a lot, and you're gonna read it. Bitch.) The next study, Trial 103, which began Fall of 2020 and will be releasing results primary results May 31st 2021. It is a phase 1 trial, which means it has stronger controls and is more likely to show a positive result, a result which will spike stock prices. Trial 103 will be looking to establish efficacy and safety of this SRP-9001, something which Trial 101 already established, but was contradicted by Trial 102. It is extremely likely Trial 103 will be successful in May. They will also be working on dosage and beginning to create their commercial model for production with these tests. They already are recruiting for Trials 301 and 303 following the completion of Trial 103.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, one failed test hasn't slowed down their pipeline of development at all. This is new technology and they are working to perfect it. It can still be modified and it will be modified. But what if something goes wrong with SRP-9001 or Pfizer completely captures the market? Currently Sarepta has 43 different drug development programs going on 27 of which involve Gene Therapy. In addition they have 2 treatments currently being produced commercially, and another 8 therapies in their final phase of study and waiting for rollout. Finally they have 14 more treatments that are in the preclinical planning phase.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSarepta isn't just a purely speculative company, they have therapies in every part of their pipeline, therapies that are life changing and will make the stock explode with any positive news. News which is more than likely coming with the amount of trials they are running and the vast range of therapies they are developing. One test dropped this stock 50%, a negative test result that didn't have to do with dangers of the drug, but difficulty presenting increase in protein synthesis vs the placebo group, something that will quickly be rectified and has only been a speed bump in the development cycle. 50% stock price drop when there are 7 other therapies in the final phases of study and are looking to release research in the coming months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow to discuss the competition quickly. Pfizer also has a gene therapy program, and it is in phase 3 of study, whereas Sarepta was in phase 2. However Sarepta was seen as being ahead in development as they began their placebo trial a whole year before Pfizer, Pfizer's placebo trial started just before the new year. Pfizer has now caught up in the race, but they have had several severe side effects in their therapy and are a whole year behind in their placebo, which could show more side effects and might not show strong results against the placebo, in the same way Sarepta had difficulty. Sarepta is well positioned against Pfizer, and at this stock price you are well positioned to take advantage of their hard work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you've gotten this far I'm guessing you'll want some positions\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJan 22nd 105$ Call, This is purely based on them rebounding from that unnecessary 50% drop\n\nMay 21 135$ Call, Pre Trial buildup Price\n\nJune 18 185$ Call, Post Trial success Price\n\nJan 21 2022 210$ Call, EOY\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBuy them stonks bb, wishing you all the best and strongest diamond hands whatever you buy, as long as it's not puts.
