Here's how it works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat is a clearinghouse?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsider the basics of trading: Buyers and sellers must agree on a price. The buyer then must pay the seller, and ownership must be formally transferred.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnter clearinghouses. The clearinghouse collects and distributes payments and transfers ownership. So traders are free to focus just on price, and to take the best price in the market regardless of who is offering it. Neither side has to worry about the other's ability to pay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor stocks in the U.S., the main clearinghouse is National Securities Clearing Corp., which is part of a larger clearing organization that operates in other markets, called Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow do they work?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nClearinghouses serve to mutualize risk. Members keep cash or collateral such as Treasury securities at the clearinghouse to cover their own activities and the obligations of other members should they fail. The clearinghouse might ask the members to post more of this money, often known as margin, if they are making riskier trades. The aim is to ensure that no individual member's failure causes the whole system to collapse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow does the financial crisis figure in this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn response to the 2008 collapse of broker-dealer Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., lawmakers writing the Dodd-Frank Act sought to beef up supervision of clearinghouses and to push more trading into clearinghouses. The focus was primarily on so-called over-the-counter derivatives, like credit-default swaps, that didn't have a central marketplace. The reforms also affected some longstanding clearinghouses, including National Securities Clearing Corp., by designating them as systemically important financial market utilities, which subjected them to greater regulatory scrutiny.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would a clearinghouse have to increase requirements?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs noted earlier, margin requirements often rise with risk. A sharp rise in the price of any security raises the prospect that it will decline just as fast, potentially adding to the risk of those trading and holding as collateral these securities.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA challenge in the stock market is that settlement is not instant. The system allows two days after the day a trade happens until the shares and money must change hands, known as \"T+2\" settlement. Over those two days, the risk that a party might be unable to complete a trade can, in rare circumstances, change dramatically based on market conditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne such circumstance might be when the price of a security is extraordinarily volatile. In that case, the seller is exposed to increased risk that in the event of a failure of a buyer to pay up, the security they would be stuck still owning is worth dramatically less. The extraordinary volatility of a stock like GameStop would increase such a concern.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother is the risk that a party suddenly owes an outsize amount of cash. In a normal market, any clearing member likely has a mostly balanced book of buys and sells, meaning they are both paying and receiving cash. And often many of their own customers' trades cancel each other, meaning they have no net obligation to the clearinghouse. But when a firm has a huge imbalance of buy orders, its obligation to pay cash skyrockets. This may have been the case this week, when there was much demand for just one or two stocks.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo who decides it's time to increase margin requirements?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHow a clearinghouse judges these risks, and therefore when it makes demands for more upfront funds, is typically formulaic. Margins can be based on equations such as value-at-risk. Exactly how the formula works, and who is responsible for losses in what order, are important elements. In the case of National Securities Clearing Corp., losses would be covered by the defaulting member's funds before the clearinghouse's own funds or other members' funds would be used.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA broker like Robinhood would also have to make decisions about its own capital, and how much it was willing or able to tie up in settlement. A broker may face separate obligations for capital levels, like with the SEC. Other brokers also clear via another intermediary -- like Apex Clearing, through which WeBull clears -- that is a member. These intermediaries may have their own risk controls they apply to their clients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWrite to Telis Demos at [telis.demos@wsj.com](mailto:telis.demos@wsj.com)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n© 2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "id": "l89ndw", "created_utc": 1611968114.0, "score": 118, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 62, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 79, "replies": [{"body": "Lies.

They wrote contracts agreeing to buy/sell a ton of shares at a certain price at a certain date... except they don't actually *have* the cash to be doing this with. What they were hoping to happen was keep the price down to ensure that the contracts would be profitable without ever needing to actually own the shares or have the cash to begin with.\n\nAnd if you don't care about the cost of buying shares... then what's stopping you from just writing as many contracts as you want? Free money, right?\n\nWell, they got caught with their pants down. Short interest on GME skyrocketed to 140%, and people sniffed something fishy reeeeaaal quick. Now, these firms are getting screwed because they'll be contractually obligated to buy the shares at whatever price we can sell them for.\n\nIn my mind, there's a powerful moral in this story for everyone here, especially newbies: **NEVER. SELL. NAKED. OPTIONS.** This should be *Trading Safety 101*.\n\nKids, if you want to sell a call option and collect that juicy premium money, you better own 100 shares of that company for when the piper comes calling. Likewise, if you want to sell a put option, you had better have enough cash to *actually buy* 100 of those shares at whatever price you picked.\n\nMost brokers will enforce this on individuals, **but these firms and market makers are getting a pass, and I think it's time for that to end.** There wouldn't be any need for bailouts if people quit doing stupid shit, and if the executives responsible were actually held accountable (unlike 2008.)\n\nSincerely, some random Theta that just wants this whole thing to be over so I can get back to selling *covered* calls on my shares of BB, AMC, and so on, without waking up to find out they all jumped 1700% in one night.

The mantra here has been hold, hold, hold with anyone selling facing the potential of a relentless onslaught of insults.  In in this case, countless members encouraged him to cash out at least some of the position to afford housing, food, and warmth.  Countless posts of support and well wishes.  \n\n\\*Likewise, folks posted support and congratulatory messages for someone who was able to secure some profits and buy delayed christmas presents that were unobtainable.  The sheer joy in his post and his newfound ability to bring happiness to others was heartwarming.\n\n\\*Countless posts of support.

Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.\n2.\t⁠⁠After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.\n3.\t⁠⁠Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.\n4.\t⁠⁠Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.\n5.\t⁠⁠We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.\n6.\t⁠⁠If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.\n7.\t⁠⁠If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Also, DO NOT transfer to your bank, because that will trigger a tax event. You're supposed to transfer between brokers. Look into this further yourself, since I'm not a tax expert.\n8.\t⁠⁠If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.\n9.\t⁠⁠It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.\n10.\t⁠Keep in mind during this to help those around you. Be different then the greedy bastards. Look for ways you can donate to local charities that are in need.
