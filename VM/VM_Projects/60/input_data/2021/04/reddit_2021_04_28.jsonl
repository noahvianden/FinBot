{"title": "$MVIS Straddle Play Before Earnings?", "selftext": "\nIt seems like people are expecting some kind of announcement/ earnings beat from Microvision $MVIS this time around, following the [March 2021 announcement of Microsoft winning a 21.8 billion dollar contract with the Army for the HoloLens.](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html)\n\nIt is rumored that this is a big win for MVIS, since they might make some of the components for the HoloLens, or at least may be licensing the ip.  \n\nI have read some of the DD posts by others on this and wasn’t entirely convinced. There is no mention of the HoloLens or Microsoft explicitly on the MVIS investor relations, However I did find the following:\n\nQuotes from MVIS recent 10k for Q4 from Dec 2020:\n“we have developed micro-display concepts and designs that could be utilized in head-mounted Augmented Reality (AR) headsets and have developed a 1440i MEMS module that can support augmented reality headsets.”\n\n“In 2019, our revenue was derived from the sale of components, from development contracts, and from royalty fees for LBS (laser beam scanning) technology. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019 and through the end of February 2020, we were selling components to a high-definition display system that we developed for a well-known customer under a development agreement. The volume and resulting revenue and gross profit from this business was fairly low. Therefore, in March 2020, we transferred production of the components to the customer. Starting in March 2020, we earned a royalty from the customer for each unit shipped, with amounts applied against the prepayment that we had previously received from the customer until the prepayment is exhausted. The value of the royalty is approximately equal to the amount of gross profit we would have earned if we continued to produce and ship the components. We believe this arrangement will help us conserve cash, and still preserves our ability to experience financial benefits should the volume of components increase in the future.”\n\nMVIS has had very little revenue, has never reported a profit, has negative operating cash flow and negative operating income, and until recently was trading at about a couple dollars or less per share for many years. \n\nCurrent stock price is about 20 dollars, and I think it will either be a bust or a blowout very soon, but I am really not sure which. All depends on earnings report and call.\n\nHas anyone here ever done a straddle play where you buy equal amounts calls and puts for a near term expiration in expectation of a significant stock price move in either direction?\n\nAnyone think MVIS this is the right application for a long options straddle?\n\n*Update 4/29/2021: I did not make any play, and instead decided to stick this one out. MVIS announced they are [making progress with their lidar tech for autonomous driving](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-announces-completion-its-long-range-lidar-sensor) on April 28, 2021. Therefore, I figured that even if they don't show any profit on their earnings on April 29 and make no mention of a buyout by Microsoft or anything about the HoloLens, their increased share price may be buoyed by new investor sentiment on the prospects for this lidar. If the stock price doesn't move enough, obviously I would take a loss on a long straddle, and I am not sure that it necessarily will since they did at least have some good news to report and there is of course still the potential that they are involved in the Microsoft-Army contract deal. Maybe they will make some announcement regarding a buyout or something in the future, but nothing was said about it on the earnings call, so for now it seems like speculation and too dangerous for me to participate in either on the bullish or bearish end (though I would lean towards bearish right now.\n\nI did listen to the earnings call and read the earnings report, and I am unimpressed, but you should do your own DD and obviously come up with your own conclusions.

They had a $100M contract lined up with a big 'Tier 1' tech company last year for an interactive smart speaker that got cancelled when COVID hit. They were also under an NDA for that but everyone thinks it was Amazon.\n\nI can't recall if they've ever come out and said that the current revenue is from the AR division, but the teardown confirms they have parts in the HL2 and the timelines match up and Microsoft is a 'well-known' customer. Both the MVIS CEO and the head of the Hololens project (Alex Kipman) have awkwardly danced around the subject whenever they're asked about it so it's obvious there are NDAs.\n\nHowever, it doesn't mean MVIS is directly contracted with MSFT. It could be a contract with a manufacturer (STM or Micron, as they also manufacture parts for the HL2) who then contracts with MSFT. Not sure that really makes a difference? It's definitely not for automotive LiDAR, though.\n\nI've also been considering a straddle play around this earnings call. I'm not sure what investors are expecting after this morning's announcement.

{"title": "Elon Musk and Tesla 'bearish' case", "selftext": "Okay this might sound a bit weird but I've been thinking about how important Elon Musk is to Tesla or in particular to Tesla's investors and I was wondering if you could actually make money by betting on 'something' happening to Elon Musk. \n\nNow imagine Elon Musk dying tomorrow. I genuinely hope we will not have to see that in the news any time soon... but just imagine. How much would Tesla's stock drop? Probably more than 50% right?\n\nOkay so what if someone were to buy deep OTM Tesla puts every month? Let's do some math.\n\nCurrently Tesla trades around 700. Since Tesla is expected to fall more than 50% if something happens to Elon Musk, let's look at 350 puts.\n350 puts expiring May 28th are currently trading at 0.37. (https://imgur.com/gallery/uBJEIC8)\n\nIf someone buys 1 Tesla put with strike price 50% away from underlying every month, the costs the first year would be 1 * 37 * 12 = $444\nThe older people become, the higher chance of dying. Now let's say this someone buys 1 more put per month the second year, and one more the third year, and so on, then the yearly costs will increase by $444 every year. \n\nMusk is 49 years old. The average life expectancy in the United States is 78 years. Assuming Elon lives an average life, he has 29 years left. https://imgur.com/gallery/8diuHNx\n\nIncreasing the amount of monthly puts by 1 every year will make the total costs in the next 29 years:\n15 * 29 * 37 * 12 = $193140\n\nIf Elon Musk were to die exactly at average life expectancy in the United States, then those 29 puts would need to make $193140 in profit to have gains overall. \n193140/29 = 6660 -> Every put would need to make $6660 profit. This means (simplified) that the price of the underlying needs to go 66 points below the strike price, which is 50% below underlying at the beginning of the month.\n\nUsing todays stock price, that would mean that Tesla needs to fall to about (350-66) 284 following Elon Musk's hypothetical death.\n\nI'm actually surprised to see that this could be a working strategy. First I looked at a fixed amount of puts every month but that would make it harder to turn a profit and also doesn't make sense since someone at age 49 does not have the same chance of dying as a 70 year old.\n\nThis is mostly a joke, I'm not actually going to do this (I think) but I was interested in the actual math so I said why not post it in WSB. \n\nAlso if Elon invents some fucking pill or some shit that makes him immortal in the next X years, then you can just throw this whole strategy away.", "id": "n0q28w", "created_utc": 1619647539.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.52, "num_comments": 67, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "Then I'll be waiting for him in Valhalla", "score": 13, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I'm calling the police", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Lol seriously 😳", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "You realise in 26 years or so Tesla will stop being a growth stock relying solely on Elon and more an actual solid company.\nTake for example Steve jobs dying and Apple.. wasn’t really a crash in the stock price then, however if it happened earlier then it would’ve had more of an effect (speculation)", "score": 36, "replies": [{"body": "10 years", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "Fair point.

The question is when would that happen?\n\nHere are some possibilities:\n\n1) When Starship finally reaches orbit, then manages to stick the landing without exploding 8 minutes later like the SN10 Starship prototype.  Or...\n\n2) When two Starships demonstrate on-orbit propellant transfer.  This needs to work in order to pull off a Mars mission--  A Starship needs to be refueled at least 6-7 times in low earth orbit to get to Mars.  Or...\n\n3) When SpaceX launches the first unmanned test flight to Mars.  The Mars transfer windows due to orbital mechanics are:  September 2022, October/November 2024, November/December 2026, and December 2028/January 2029.\n\nMaybe buying Tesla puts for some of those dates when a Starship Mars flight is possible might be a play, if Elon will sell some Tesla stock to fund the Mars missions.  :-)", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "What's a solid way to bet against a company without risking a scenario in which I lose more than the money I put in (as would happen with short-selling)?
