For example, over the past week INRG (London's equivalent) has been trading strong on open (+2% per day). However, when US markets open at 14:30GMT, INRG tanks to -2% due to Plug sell-offs. \n\nWhy dies this happen?\n\nVolatility in Plug's price massively shifts the ETF's price. Therefore, if Plug drops significantly, and an investor wants to pull out of the ETF, then they also pull out of all it's other holdings. These other holdings are fairly illiquid and Blackrock are major shareholders (this is why NZ needed to extend trading). This means that it's hard for Blackrock to get good price points (not many buyers) and can cause lots of volatility to the price of these holdings. Due to the popularity of green tech recently (following the inauguration), it's accelerated Blackrock's % share ownership exponentially in it's holdings which has made the markets even more illiquid - hence why S&P are expanding the clean energy index, which enables Blackrock to spread their assets further and reduce volatility.\n\nThis should provide comfort to a lot of investors who have been concerned about this for months, and it will make the ETF (and it's holdings) more attractive as a long-term hold (as they are less exposed to Plug). This volatility on a day to day basis isn't healthy for an ETF (or it's holdings), so reducing the impact of a few names is a great thing.\n\nPersonally, I would expect stabilisation and strong growth as 2021 goes on.

When the \"downfall\" of plug began earlier this year, it was due to a few different factors as I understood it. And not insignificant ones.
