{"title": "NVAX - Likely my last update DD before reaching Callhalla", "selftext": "I've made a few posts before this ( [1st Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lq3ksw/nvax_dont_miss_this_perfect_vaccine_play_headed/),  [2nd Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/luuige/nvax_part_ii_last_call_before_a_shit_ton_of/), [3rd Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mlielu/nvax_i_liked_it_at_300_i_love_it_at_180/)) but I know it's alot to go through so I shall give a brief comprehensive summary here. Just a reminder none of this is financial advice, I am but a mere PhD student that has had the ride of their lives on this stock. My goal isn't to shill or hype but instead to sharpen the conviction of my fellow big-cojone'd NVAX bulls, to concentrate info from different sources, and to create a space for discussion and overleveraged speculation. I think this stock is done taking a shit, we have a good idea of lower bound supports, and we're ready to blow some loads with upcoming catalysts. I also have some current questions I'd like to get the input of the community on. So let's dig in!\n\n**1) Why I believe in the technology**\n\nReally recommend my first post for a more in-depth discussion on this but basically this vaccine is antigen-based which is a very standard tried-and-true modality often used in \"traditional\" vaccines like flu vaccines etc. What makes them special is they add a natural compound (an \"adjuvant\") that makes your immune system super responsive to the antigen. This adjuvant is actually a saponin that is harvested from soapbark trees that grow in Chile. The benefit of using this is that 1) old people and people with weak immune systems respond well and build immunity even with lower doses of antigen 2) you can make vaccines with small amounts of antigen which makes them much cheaper and MOST IMPORTANTLY 3) you can \"fit\" more antigen varieties into a single dose. There's only so much antigen you can inject into a person at once so with this technology you can have a single vaccine with flu AND several covid variant antigens as opposed to having to get a separate vaccine for each virus. Also since this vaccine is protein antigen based you can keep it at 4C (same temp you keep your beers) for months.\n\nAdditionally!!!!! We've seen alot of AMAZING efficacy and safety results from the UK and SA phase 1/2/3 trials and the US phase 1/2 trial (still waiting for phase 3 data to drop soon!). **This is one of the main reasons I remain so bullish.** The humongous unknown risk of efficacy/safety has been largely cleared and now we're just sifting through some other issues/bottlenecks/FUD that I will talk about below. Anyone that trades biotech stocks knows that safety/efficacy are the BIGGEST risk that can curb stomp a stock and we've cleared that in my opinion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**2) A brief history of this chart**\n\nThis is one of the wildest charts you'll find and I think it's incredibly important to understand what caused it to look like that so that you can get a better picture of where we're going.\n\n**Sept 2016** \\- Plummet from \\~$150 to \\~$25 came from their RSV vaccine getting poor efficacy results\n\n**Feb 2019** \\- Plummet from \\~$40 to \\~$10 came from them failing the RSV efficacy trials again lmao. HOWEVER things are looking up for RSV vaccine recently (this deserves its own DD honestly but you can read more about it [here](https://www.novavax.com/our-pipeline))\n\nAt this point you can see why investors had no faith in NVAX. It was beaten down like a rabid dog like Ziptrader Charlie would say. Enter covid left stage:\n\n**May 2020** \\- Gap up from \\~$15 to \\~$40 came from A) fantastic nano-Flu phase 3 results (their very own flu vaccine, shown to be better than the current state-of-the-art flu vaccines) which is basically their first big WIN and B) beginning of clinical trials for covid vaccine.\n\n**Aug 2020** \\- Gap up to $180 came from great phase 1/2 covid vaccine results! I remember these glory days. Too bad we then plummeted and became range bound in the $80-$100 range. This was caused by a combo of sell-the-news and competitor companies (MRNA, BNTX, JNJ, AZN) making fast progress.\n\n**Feb 2021**  \\- Gap up to $300 from phase 3 interim data coming from UK phase 3 trial. This was fantastic news! Best in class vaccine with stellar safety and 96% efficacy against original variant. \n\n**Mar 2021 - Present** \\- We fell from grace and have been bouncing between $170 and $220. Lots of factors here but of course the March market madness did not help this low float stock. I vividly remember NVAX falling 10+% day after day during the worst of it. I kept buying the dip and now I'm jacked to the MF tits and not ready to sell even when we get nice 13% days here and there.\n\nNotice anything so far about this chart? **It loves to gap up**. This is a low float stock and the market cap is comparably small compared to competitors like MRNA, JNJ, etc. It's not uncommon to see it almost double when BIG catalysts drop and trust me when I tell you we've got ALOT of big catalysts on the menu. We've recently found a ROCK HARD floor at $170 and most recently a very strong support at $200. This stock has been severely de-risked and I think right now is still a damn good time to buy because of this asymmetrical risk.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**3) Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt - Bear case and the FUD spread by short sellers**\n\n\\-*NVAX is too late to the game. The entire world is vaccinated already. Pandemic is over.* This is obviously not true and I've written extensively about it in my 2nd and 3rd posts. India, home to 1.4 BILLION people has only vaccinated a little more than 1% of its vaccination. India is currently the epicenter of the pandemic with cases going parabolic recently sadly. It should also be noted that NVAX has a [deal](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-announces-memorandum-understanding-gavi-cumulative) with the Gavi Institute in India to manufacture and deliver 1.1 Bn doses of covid vaccines. More on India a little further down the post. Additionally, new variants continue to pop up and it seems more and more like we'll be getting covid booster shots for a while.\n\n\\-*Insiders are selling so they know something is up*. This is so stupid don't fall for this trap. They've sold days before major catalysts in the past. Everything is scheduled ahead of time and from what I understand also has something to do with them exercising their options. Let's not even mention the fact that selling millions in stock right before you drop horrible news would be the most blatant illegal insider trading ever lol\n\n\\-*NVAX is having manufacturing issues. They're not gonna be able to produce the vaccines they promised, just look at what happened to the EU deal.* I wrote about this alot in my 3rd post. I was worried at first that the raw materials they were missing perhaps was the adjuvant that comes from the soapbark trees (yikes!) However, as it turns out [the problem is actually the supply of 2,000 liter plastic bags](https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/lack-grow-bags-a-hefty-problem-for-novavax-s-covid-19-vaccine-production-push) that they need to grow their cells. The bags exist but they're currently being locked up by the US as per the Defense Production Act. Literally the US is reserving the bags for Pfizer and now the institute in India that is supposed to produce a ton of the NVAX vaccines does not have access to them. However the CEO of the institute has [publicly pleaded for Biden to lift the embargo](https://twitter.com/megtirrell/status/1383129792292167680) and it seems like their may be [some action here soon](https://twitter.com/Cold_Peace_/status/1384537640322674689) especially given the dire COVID situation in India. I honestly have no fucking idea what will happen and this is simply what I have gathered in my investigative work across sources. Any clarity or insight here is super appreciated. I don't even know if these bags are reason NVAX was having manufacturing issues for the EU. Regardless, GSK is making some of the NVAX vaccine soon and they should have some stockpiled already at least for the UK and early approvers.\n\n\\-*NVAX US phase 3 trials must have had bad results that's why they haven't released the data yet.* I saved this one for last because it's the most unlikely one in my opinion. I'd be surprised to see repeatedly stellar results in US phase 1/2, UK phase 1/2/3interim/3final trials only to see something worse than JNJ's 66% efficacy in the US/Mexico phase 3 trial.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**4) Catalysts and Questions for y'all**\n\nOK this is where I summarize what I think will happen soon and also where I need input from y'all. NVAX has completely left us bagholders (oops, I mean investors) in the dark on some of these expected dates and it has been the source of [much strife in twitter comments](https://twitter.com/Novavax/status/1384489266483433472) against the leadership and PR team of NVAX. Not gonna lie they can learn to market and pump themselves more but I appreciate their hardwork on getting the science done well regardless.\n\n**A) Filing for UK Approval**\n\n\\-From what I understand NVAX has already begun the rolling review by the UK MHRA and EU's EMA. They have provided the interim data for UK phase 3 at least and they hopefully have also submitted the finalized UK phase 3 data at this point but I do not know. \n\n\\-Another thing they need to submit is a CMC package. This basically is evidence they provide these regulatory agencies that their manufacturing process is robust and can produce consistent vaccine batches. I have NO idea what the status is with this (did they finish it already?) and any insight is appreciated.\n\n\\-I can only imagine they'd make an announcement when they actually file in the UK but who knows. I also am curious to know how long after filing we can expect to see approval. My hope is that this whole process will be done and the vaccine will be approved by the [end of April](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-britain-vaccine/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-could-be-approved-by-uk-in-april-evening-standard-says-idUSKBN2BM1IF).\n\n\\-Guidance on this could literally drop any day this week or next week and I'm willing to bet we'll gap up on the news as always. As soon as it's approved by the UK then Canada, Australia, and New Zealand will likely follow suit.\n\n**B) US Phase 3 results**\n\n\\-I'm super excited this is gonna be fucking awesome\n\n\\-US/Mexico Phase 3 trials started much later than the UK phase 3 trials. People were concerned for a long time that it would take a ton of time to get results. Even NVAX executives were saying that they were gonna swing for the fences and see if the US FDA would consider an EUA just with UK data instead of having to wait for US data. \n\n\\-Turns out there were tons of willing participants and the trial got 25,000 people signed up in record time. Additionally, waves of covid caused collection of endpoints to happen much faster than expected. TODAY they started crossover trials. This basically means that people that had received the placebo get the read vaccine and people that got the real vaccine get the placebo (they are all still blinded). What is significant about this is that [THEY WOULDN'T DO THE CROSSOVER WITHOUT FIRST GETTING ENOUGH ENDPOINTS TO FILE FOR AN EUA](https://twitter.com/NayeemTheDream/status/1384265587770023942?s=1001).\n\n\\-We basically were all but explicitly told that US phase 3 is complete and the data/news can drop any day now. Put on your spacesuits.\n\n**C) US FDA filing**\n\n\\-NVAX is [aiming for May](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/novavax-targets-may-approval-for-covid-19-vaccine-u-s). \n\n\\-Again, I have no idea what the status is on the CMC package for the US filing and any insight is welcome.\n\n\\-There are some [interesting speculations on twitter](https://twitter.com/Biohazard3737/status/1384595862202896385) but I have a hard time making sense of them. Take it with a grain of salt as this guy/gal says him/herself.\n\n**D) EU Deal**\n\n\\-The EU deal fell through last month but it seems like it could be getting revived soon. They are facing pressure after the AZN shitshow. \n\n\\-This would be an awesome catalyst but don't hold your breath these EU chiefs are slow AF and seem to be generally fumbling oftentimes when it comes to securing doses for their populace\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**5) My positions and good ways to play this**\n\n\\-My positions are all in on $200c 5/21 options. Like literally my whole portfolio. I don't know that I would recommend this approach for most, the IV on these options is insanely high. I do, however, expect the IV of these options to expand following one of these catalysts. I know this is the opposite of what we typically think of with IV crush following binary events. However, I think the stock is exceptionally undervalued and I DO NOT think approval has been priced in. The majority of the gain will hopefully come from intrinsic value from the calls going deep ITM but I also hope to get an IV bump as people realize that this company has a rich future ahead of it and the call options gain demand. It has been an absolutely wild ride but I'm comfortable to say I now understand the true meaning of diamond hands.\n\n\\-Shares of course (or LEAPS) are godly if you have that sort of capital. Then you can just hang on for a long time. I will definitely switch to LEAPS after this immediate saga is over. I think once NVAX starts actually making a revenue it will absolutely blow earnings out of the park.\n\n\\-If you want to take advantage of high IV then of course theta gang strategies are nice. I caution against selling calls, this stock is ready to pop. Selling puts is a good strategy though you'll miss out on the extra tendies if they go parabolic. I severely caution against close expiration put credit spreads even though they are bullish because this stock CAN be squirrely and drop 10% in a day. If your spreads close OTM you can lose it all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStay fresh and see y'all on the moon!", "id": "mv42aw", "created_utc": 1618963804.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 64, "comments": [{"body": "DD posts like this want me to go long on $Adderall", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Having said that screw it, I’m in.", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "You can... buy takeda (they own Vyvanse and adderall XR)", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Been bullish since $3.50 in October 2019. \n\nThis is the way", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "November 2019 $5 when my brokerage allowed me to buy", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Wow!

Additionally, they are starting Flu+covid trials this Fall/Winter and they have the massive advantage over MRNA and PFE that they actually have a standalone Flu vaccine already with great efficacy.
