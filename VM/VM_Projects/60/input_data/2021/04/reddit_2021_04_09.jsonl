Well, week   after Good Friday.  Whatever.   NrdRage  here with your weekly dose of   \"what weird ass company I've  never  before considered should I throw   money at this time?\"  Today  we're  going to be looking at a company with a  150 billion dollar  market cap  (I know, I know, I usually shy people   away from companies  this  big)...that you've probably never even heard   of.  I give to you,  the  techgrowthboomer (?  I dunno, I guess it's a new  space) utility   company:  NextEra.  I dunno, sounds like a fucking   sporting goods   store to me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# A   fucking UTILITY  company?  Really? First you talk about a garbage  engine   maker you  trash the whole time before going long, and now you  bring   this Boomer  ass weaksauce here?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYes,   yes I  totally am.  You're  right, they are just a utility company,  which   means slow and steady  revenue streams, by and large.  But they've  got a   secret.  Well, 3:   Their CEO could steal your wife without even   trying,  and they also  happen to be the largest producer of clean energy   on the  entire  continent.  Which means they get all that sweet, sweet    unregulated  energy income.  Which also means they're afforded the    benefit of  trading like a growth stock to a certain extent.  Which also     means...oh shit, let's wait on that 3rd secret for a minute.  Added     bonus:  Even though almost every green energy stock from chargers to     producers to makers on the market has been getting gangraped the last     few weeks (they doin' my boys $BE and $CLNE dirty, man, but they're     fighters.  Stop asking, I'm still super bullish on them both...)\n\nIf     you live in the Southeast, you probably do business with these dudes    in  one way or another.  Who cares?  If you live in Duke Energy    territory,  you probably saw them roll up into Durham recently and try    and buy those  dudes out.  Big fucking deal.  They've got their fingers    in power  delivery just about everywhere, though.  With the exception   of  some  mid-Atlantic states and some areas in the Rocky Mountains,   they  stretch  from Texas to fucking those weird fucks in Prince Edward    Island.  Cue  the fucking cat memes, because none of this is    interesting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Let's see how this turbine runs:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese    guys are HUGE.   Like, that  \"massager\" your wife keeps in her    nightstand huge.  Depending on the  day, they're somewhere between 47-49    in the S&P 500, by far the  largest utility on Wall Street.  They    generate between 4 and 5  billion a quarter in revenue, and run at about  a   25% net margin.   They trade at an absolutely INSANE multiple  relative   to their peers  (about 30 compared to an average of maybe half  that for   everybody  else), so they seem really expensive at first  glance.   They're   looking at about 9% YOY growth for the next 3 years,  which is    staggeringly good for utilities, but not mind blowing as a  growth play.      As mentioned above, they get away with that valuation  because  their   positioning as a global leader in renewable energy  production  moves them   away from utility and towards growth.  There's  not an  executive in the   sector that will tell you anyone else is run  better  as a company,   though.   They've recently been on the prowl to  acquire  somebody -   anybody - in order to expand their reach and market   dominance.  Hasn't   happened yet, but with the way their stock is   valued relative to their   competitors, it's only a matter of time   before they make an M&A or   two in all-stock deals.  Their   financial house is in order, and their   overall debt load is   respectable for their market.\n\nThe     great thing about $NEE is that, not only are they ahead of the curve    in  every way in transitioning from coal to other forms of energy, but    the  costs for these technologies continue to drop, meaning that  their    margins are going to improve dramatically going forward - which  is why    they can sustain the premium valuation.

The  reason why these ETFs never do shit is because  the SPDJI   index only  has 30 stonks in it, and fucking $PLUG is the $AAPL  of the   clean  energy world according to it in terms of its weighting.   Which   means  if you bought in when $PLUG was rangebound from 65-70  earlier   this  year, you didn't make any tendies, and then you lost your  ass when    people got tired of $PLUG's bitch ass (Disclaimer:  I'm long  plug and    will be a bagholder until May when my calls expire worthless.     Fucking  $PLUG.  Don't buy that stock, and not just because they suck.  They're the anti-thesis of this entire \"Blackrock buying\" DD).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell,  that's   about to  change.  The number of stonks going into this is going  to   jump from 30  to....100.  At least.  Dalton (hmmm, I thought he'd be    bigger) has been  calling this the \"Blackrockageddon\", and you should    absolutely go read  his series of DD's on this topic.  I won't quote the    entire thing, but  the TL:DR is this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* On April 19th, this index gets rebalanced hardcore\n* Whatever     gets added to the index, Blackrock (which, if you didn't know, is  the    Brad Wesley of the fucking investing world and the size of a mid   sized   country in terms of its assets) will be buying the ever-loving   shit out   of what's in there, because that's what they do.\n* Therefore,     anything that gets added is going to get injected with a concoction   of   speed, cocaine, and some leftover Surge cola from 1998.\n* This     index is going to be taking a sampling from best in breed and    influence  from a number of different sectors within the clean energy    metaverse.   Energy production, energy storage, smart grids, alternative    fuel for  vroom vrooms.  Think back now, children:  Who did I say was    the biggest  producer of renewable energy in North America?  Think   maybe  that company  might get added to a Dow tracked list?  Think   maybe, as  BY FAR the  biggest company in the entire fucking sector,   that company  might have a  disproportionately huge weighting in the   index?   If you  don't, you  might be the bad kind of retarded.  I'm   telling you this  because Dalton  has a philosophy to always \"be nice\"   and he won't say  it.\n* This is about as close to a sure thing as you can get.  95%, easy.\n\n# \n\n# How much will Blackrock buy?\n\nDalton's     friend Wade says 400 million.  And he was wearing a manbun before it     was not cool, so you know you can trust him.  Actually, he had the   only   manbun in history that wasn't uncool.   My projections (this is   an   interesting thing, because he and I got interested in this shift at     about the same time) are slightly more aggressive, and I'm in the     480-520 range.  That's a lot of 1964 Buick Rivieras no matter who's     right.  These kinds of buys represent...oh jesus, almost 30 days of     volume for this company?  When you're talking this much money, you're     talking the back channels chosen retards like me use to buy our mass     quantities to consume (oddly, ThinkorSwim and JPM reserve just don't     have that much laying around), so you won't physically see it in the     order books, but you'll see an unexplainable melt-up.  Except that I     just explained it.  So there's that.\n\n# Technical analysis, aka Man's search for faith, that sort of shit\n\nI'm     going to do things a little differently this time because what I'm     DD'ing is really more of a momentum trade than a \"this company goin'  to    the moon, lads\" type of trade.   Instead I'm just going to show  one chart that explains   why the  hell these guys are so different from  every other utility out   there,  because I think that's all I need,  and then a quick 3 month daily.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q56x3eema6s61.jpg?width=1164&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0596bbef7e42e4381880348b20c7d774b84983b5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat    shit is fucking crazy.  I  mean, not \"ripping the throat out of his    enemies\" crazy, but pretty  fucking crazy.  In short, this gal's got    entirely too many brains to  have an ass like that.\n\nOne price chart, but no lines.  Just to show that it's winding up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fxm5xw2oa6s61.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54436d0db431928c703210ce8b1f612d5a69f1ca\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# So, to summarize:\n\n* Big     ass utility about to get added to the world's biggest clean energy   ETF  -  and, in fact, is likely to be the most heavily weighted stock in    that  index\n* Has consistently outperformed everybody else in their sector for basically forever\n* Is one of the rarer types of stock that isn't presently trading at or near it's ATH, so it's got some room to run organically\n* Maybe you fucking $ICLN cucks who have been bagholding that shit ETF forever can finally break even now\n* Even     if the momentum trade goes sideways, there's very low risk of   existing   tendies.  Your upside is significant, and your downside if   everything   goes as wrong as it possibly can is fairly minimal\n* You     can still convince yourself as you cry in the shower about how old     you're getting that you're not REALLY old because you aren't buying a     utility company, but a Techility company, and everybody knows fusion  is    the best kind of food.\n* Look     at it this way:  WHen you finally realize you ARE old and move to     Florida, owning shares of this is like getting a rebate on your     electricity bill\n* I     didn't talk about it, but they recently had a 4:1 stock split, and     those usually provide some runway as people interpret the stock as     \"cheaper\".\n* I     don't remember Patrick Swayze ever talking with funny accents except    in  To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar, so Dalton might    have  gone to drag.\n\n# Price Targets:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll     be straight:  Normally I would say it's priced pretty fairly right    now.   If not for the index shakeup, this would not have been my DD.    I've got  some short plays I'd like to talk about at some point because    the  market is going to turn to shit in May (and let me just apologize    for  not making a $DASH short DD a month ago, cause hoo-boy has that    been a  great play - hopefully some of y'all caught me talking about  it   in the  dailies).  I mean, more shit than it is right now.  As it    stands, I  think a short term target of 83 is really likely.  I've seen    long term  price targets of up to $113, but I just don't see it.  I    think $87 would  be where I'd start questioning you if you didn't take    profits.  And  remember, this entire thesis is based upon Blackrock    giving it a boost,  plus the added exposure that comes with being added    to a Dow index.  The  thesis all changes if that turns out to not    happen.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# How to play it (There's always barber college if you fuck this up):\n\nThis     is a momentum play where you're just now starting to see the wind up    of  momentum (AKA \"How long you gonna be in town?  Not very long\").      Usually you'd see me advocate for some 90-120 day leaps 20% out of  the    money because usually what I talk about are mid caps with a lot  of    volatility that can flip your whole world upside down on not a lot  of    news because I like a bit of pod racing, but this trade should  resolve    itself much more quickly.  Buy some May 21 80c's ($1.50 at  the time of    this writing) and run like a thief if you want just a  little taste of    adrenaline.  If you want to play super safe, let the  underlying equity    come in a buck to the red and then buy $2 in the  money.  If you've  got   one of those working stiff retarrrrment  accounts, go into your  401k and   buy some shares.  If you want to be  ballsy about it all, grab  some   September 17 85c's for 2 bucks and  roll the dice.  The IV is  going to be   at a minimum because, even  though this thing trades at a  tech  multiple,  the IV is reminiscent of  the utility sector it lives  in.\n\n**Commentary   that will age like milk:**    On the day of this writing, $NEE is slightly   green on yet another   no-volume largely red day where 10 stocks are   somehow making the SPY   green but most anything you'll track is red.    It'll probably fade into   red.  You might save a couple pennies.\n\n# Position Disclaimers:\n\nI'm     actually not going to tell you how many shares I have because it    sounds  like a ton (and, to be fair, it is) and I don't want to give off    the  impression that I'm YOLO'ing my life savings on this when the   fact  of  the matter is my managed portfolios basically is a mid sized   hedge  fund  and boring ass companies like this make up a pretty good   chunk of  that.  Fun money,  I've got 300 5/21 80c's, that I bought in   February on a hunch  about  re-balancing, and 500 6/18 75c's/ 500 6/18   77.5c (have been  building  that position since early March, so these   were OTM when I got  them).   These options, because they're so cheap,   really don't represent  a  significant holding even in my fun account   and my means of playing  this  trade is mostly via shares.\n\nIf     you're trying to shadow trade me, I don't know that the 6/18     75's/77.5's are the right choice because they're currently sitting at     about 4.60, but I only paid 1.47 for them so they made more sense for  me    than they will you.  That said, if you're risk averse, there's a    reason  why I chose June and I chose 75 when I started opening my    position.\n\nAll my love (And remember to not eat the big white mint in the urinal)\n\n\\-Chad Dickens\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# PS:\n\nBecause     a lot of people have been asking me, as I've done DD's on a number  of    clean energy stonks:  While I think that $BE DESERVES a place in  an    index like this just because the type of clean energy they do is  so    damned unique and not represented by anybody else that is a likely  add    (nobody else getting added to this makes fucking microgrids), I   wouldn't   bet any money on it getting a spot in there.  I'll be   pleasantly   surprised if it does, but I'd put the odds of that at 20%.\n\nHOWEVER,     since this index is tracking clean energy FUELS on top of clean   energy   generation, my boy $CLNE wants his shot at the title, and I   wouldn't  be  the least bit surprised if he gets a ticket to The Show.    Plus, I  mean  it's CALLED the Clean Energy ETF.  You can't spell Clean   Energy  ETF  without Clean Energy.\n\n# PPS:\n\nDamn, what's a brother gotta do to get some Daddy DD or Booty Hunter gilding around this bish?", "id": "mnksim", "created_utc": 1617985133.0, "score": 225, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 59, "comments": [{"body": "*THIS THAT EVIAN THAT GREY POUPON THAT TED TALK- EY!*\n\nI am AllDatDalton, and I approve this message 🚀", "score": 51, "replies": []}, {"body": "knights of nee", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "Knights who call nee", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Can you elaborate on why the market is going to shit in May?

Looking at the BlackRock spreadsheet, it says NEE has a 4% weight in the fund.  If the aforementioned are true... then this means the entire fund will be worth (1 / 0.04) x 400m x $77.94 ~= 780 BILLION, which is crazy given that the current fund net asset is only 5.5 billion.\n\nAlso, if we take that number and check how much of other companies will be bought then it becomes even crazier.  Example, ENIA is given a weight of 1.685%.  So BlackRock would have to buy 780b x 0.01685 ~= 13b, which is ENIAs entire market cap....\n\nIf this is just a “rebalance” and we dont expect BlackRock to invest much more into the fund, then isn’t 400m shares way too optimistic??? I don’t know how rebalances usually work but let’s say they increase net asset to 10b.  10b x 4% = 2.5b cap.  Divide by 78, and that gives us 32million shares.  If they stick with around 6b asset, then it’ll be about 18million.  \n\nSo did I misunderstand or miscalculate something??
