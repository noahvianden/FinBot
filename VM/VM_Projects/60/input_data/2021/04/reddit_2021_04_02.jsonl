I just look at it without any emotional connection to the cool factor of the tech and product, and look at risk reward from an investor stand point.  Let's say they quadruple sales over the next 2 years,  but at the same time they correct into a more reasonable earnings multiplier (I can't find a company who maintained 1000x earnings long term. ) 4x sales but trading at let's say 100x earnings instead of 1000x, where does that leave the stock price? Is that less than where it is today even though the company executes? Don't get me wrong,  great company.
