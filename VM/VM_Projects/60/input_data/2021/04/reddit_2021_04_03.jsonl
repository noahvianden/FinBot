{"title": "What other markets/products could Tesla get into by 2030-2035 in your opinion?", "selftext": "Curious to see what everyone thinks could come from Tesla in the future. Doesn't have to be backed by any facts or statements released from Tesla, just pure speculation. Thought it might be fun to discuss.\n\nFor instance I remember in a [Dave Lee](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCi2G5aQTN0YwGIfnt1u7Nbg) video he once brought up the idea of a Tesla motorhome, now wouldn't that be awesome? A Tesla motorhome with solar panels across the entire roof with an automatic pop up/extendable awning with even more solar panels, with a battery pack storage on the end of the RV. Might not be able to produce enough energy just from the solar panels, but it'd be cool. Quick google search tells me in 2019 the global RV market was 42B$ and it's expected that by 2026 it'll be a 64B$ market, so it's nice niche market. \n\nI was going to add ATV to the list but a quick google tells me that this has already been confirmed. ATV's are a small and niche market but if you include UTV's into the mix you get a modest 15B$ market by 2025 ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/atv--utv-market-size-is-projected-to-reach-usd-14-109-2-million-by-2025---valuates-report-301115715.html)).\n\nWhat about a snowmobile? Couldn't find any reliable figures given how niche this market is and how unique it is to North America. \n\nPerhaps a recreational boat? [Estimates](https://www.arizton.com/market-reports/recreational-boat-market#:~:text=The%20global%20recreational%20boating%20market,growth%20drivers%2C%20and%20vendor%20analysis) put this market as big as 57B$.\n\nAnd of course we can't forget the potential VTOL market in the future, although this still seems so out of reach to me it'll be interesting to see if it becomes a reality in the future. \n\nNone of these markets are huge, and they probably wouldn't move tesla stock much in the grand scheme of things, but maybe some of you beautiful geniuses can think of some more grandiose ideas worth mentioning :).  Can be absolutely anything from any of their different segments, or a completely new segment that they don't even operate in yet.", "id": "mj0p89", "created_utc": 1617421568.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 60, "comments": [{"body": "Logistics. \n\nIF (big if) autonomous driving becomes real and it's Tesla, they can go vertical in many more areas than just robotaxis.\n\nSome sort of public transit services, e.g. something more closely resembling buses, which are more politically friendly than a zillion single person taxis. \n\nRobotaxi like business, but for trucking.\n\nA long haul network, akin to grey hound.\n\nEtc.", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "I like the idea of autonomous public transit and an autonomous long haul bus :o.", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is highly probable.
