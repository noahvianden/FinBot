If y‚Äôall have any other advice let me hear it.\n1. Don‚Äôt panic sell- just because a stock has a bad day don‚Äôt panic sell and lose your money. If you truly believe in your stock, it will go back up.\n\n2. Starting out invest in ETF‚Äôs- this is probably the thing I wish I could‚Äôve been told. ETF‚Äôs are like and mutual fund but you can buy it anytime during the day. They r a safe way to consistently make money. They won‚Äôt lose you money(if you pick a good one) in the long run. \n\n3. Don‚Äôt buy a stock because someone said to- I have fallen victim to ‚Äúhype‚Äù stocks that I think will be the next GME, but ultimately fall 50%. I‚Äôm down about 20% in my portfolio because I bought into stocks that are sketchy.\n\n4. Stay away from options- some new investors may not know what it is and it should stay that way. It is the equivalent of gambling. \n\n5.crypto- crypto is very volatile and u could lose your whole investment in a day. I wouldn‚Äôt say you shouldn‚Äôt invest in crypto, but be smart. Also don‚Äôt buy DOGE it‚Äôs literally a meme.\n\n6. Don‚Äôt invest money that your aren‚Äôt prepared to lose- the stock market is unpredictable sometimes. A new pandemic could occur or a world war could breakout or another Great Depression could happen. We don‚Äôt know when or how, but the market could crash at any time, so don‚Äôt invest money that you aren‚Äôt prepared to lose. \n\nHopefully this will help someone:)", "id": "nj9xar", "created_utc": 1621783441.0, "score": 152, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 58, "comments": [{"body": "Make a plan, and stick to it!", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "yes, this.
