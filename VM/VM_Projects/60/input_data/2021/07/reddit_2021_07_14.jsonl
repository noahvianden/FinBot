They borrow from eachother all the time for clerical reasons, sure, but their function is to lend, not borrow. The Fed was scared of a full fledged banking collapse threat again, and allowed banks to consider USTs on their balance sheet as assets instead of liabilities. These rules were allowed to expire in March, which caused TLT to drop, which Micheal Burry of all people made a ton of money on.\n\n> So big money shorted the hell out of the treasury bonds which helped keep bond rates low.\n\nShorting reduces the price of the underlying asset. So shorts would decrease bond prices and raise bond rates.\n\nI agree with your description of what’s going on with shorts, but the Fed can’t really do anything about it. **IF** they can even control long term rates, if they raise the rates the shorting bonanza slows down and the equity bull market stops and puts fragile business at significant risk, or they lower rates they risk squeezing (in true GME fashion) the entire financial world to death.

Despite the inherent risk of speculation, it was widely believed that the stock market would continue to rise forever...

Thats not new.\n\nThe biggest reason why the great depression happened is leverage and deregulation. We were riding a wave of deregulation while banks were not insured and they could invest equity internally any way they wanted. Many leveraged on top of that. When they went under, people also lost their savings at the banks. This was the origin of FDIC insurance and Glass-Steagal which was revoked by Republicans who had been trying to end it for a long time and signed by Clinton. Terrible move by all involved.\n\nLeverage levels in the great depression were 10 to 1. Today most brokers dont allow much more than 2 to 1. A few allow 3 to 1. This is tightly regulated today by the fed who require banks to maintain certain debt to equity ratios to stay in business. They change these amounts frequently but they have not been anywhere near depression levels since then.\n\nInterest rates during the roaring 20s was also much higher than now running around 6%. It dropped after the markets crashed.\n\nWhen rent goes up consumer disposable income comes down. Consumer disposable income keeps CPI under control. In other words its the other way around. When CPI goes up, that drives rent up. It becomes a supply and demand problem. If CPI is high it usually means people have a lot of disposable income. That means they will want better housing and that competition sends rent up. Rent doesnt just go up due to housing prices. Thats actually a false correlation. Though they seem correlated because in the US they seem in lock step, thats actually incidental. They really arent.\n\nRent is 100% dependent on income growth (basically affordability). So in other words, its very possible for RE prices to sky rocket while rent go down. This has already happened in many parts of the world and the US is a rare exception due to how much land we still have. Its also very possible for rent to sky rocket even when housing prices go down. This is exactly what happened between 2008-2012. Even though housing prices fell 50%, rent actually accelerated up. Why? People who lost homes needed a place to rent...\n\nCommercial rent doesnt work the same way as residential so it doesnt effect business the same way. They are usually tied to CPI or even less than that on long term deals. Thus they are usually lagging inflation.\n\nLast bit. Inflation doesnt hurt business for very long. Adjustments usually only take a quarter before they adjust and are back on track. The real danger is consistently high rising inflation over long periods of time. Then it becomes bad. But if its just bad for a quarter or two or three or even four, then its not a big deal. But if it extends to multi years, then you have major problems. This is what happened in the 70s aka stagflation. They had extremely high inflation that averaged around 8% a year for almost a decade and businesses couldnt adjust fast enough before getting hit in the gut again.
