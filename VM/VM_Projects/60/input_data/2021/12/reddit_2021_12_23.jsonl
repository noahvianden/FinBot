{"title": "What's down for fundamental reasons and will bounce back quickly?", "selftext": "Answer: the stuff people like, but sold because they needed to de-risk\n\nYou are looking for big + liquid + widely owned. Earnings were fine/revisions positive. At the very least, the story shouldn't be challenged. Mega-cap internet, select SaaS blow-ups, etc. Hedge fund darlings basically.\n\nWhat about the stuff that’s down for fundamental reasons, yet should come back quickly?\n\nA lot of this depends on your personal views (if you think oil is about to rip 20% higher, there you go) Right now, I think personally think this bucket includes COVID impacted names… I think people chill out about Omicron sooner rather than later. Pfizer Paxlovid EUA will be a positive catalyst… and should go a long way towards preserving normalcy in the US.\n\nWhat's down for a fundamental reason, and will take a while to recover?\n\nLarge/diverse category here...Some EM's seem to fit this bucket. Brazil is a mess and investors won’t be in a rush to buy the dip until there is more certainty around the 2022 elections. China? While you could get a quick bounce, it will take a while for the China love-hate pendulum to swing back. Not only has the economy slowed, but the geopolitical risk premium has increased. Investors won’t go back to shilling Chinese internet stocks at idea dinners overnight\n\nSome COVID “winners” hitting tough comps also fit here. Most investors won’t rush to buy ahead of decelerating growth. In some cases estimates might need to come down.\n\nAnd there are plenty of companies where the \"resolution\" will probably take time. Think 2h 2022 / 2023. For instance, ATVI – You know the next few quarters are going to suck. And you also know they will throw the kitchen sink at 2022 (to be fair, probably doesn't go down much). But, unless you expect some corporate action, there aren't many imminent catalysts. Or cable names – they will probably need to show a couple quarters of decent net adds until people chill out about the prospect of fiber overbuilds.\n\nFinally, what about the stuff that’s down for non-fundamental reasons, yet might take a while to come back?\n\nBusted IPO’s / SPACs. Not many PM's say “oh yeah lets re-gross into this name that trades $5m / day with a huge PE overhang and a chart that looks like death.” This isn’t comprehensive. There are a couple groups of companies that straddle these categories.\n\nFor instance, “legacy” payments:\n\nAre they down for entirely non-fundamental reasons? No, there are \\*some\\* competitive developments. But I think the price reaction seems totally disproportionate in many cases. Same with gambling names. Yes, competition in the US Online Sportsbook/iCasino markets remains robust. Yes, you could see additional regulations in the UK. Yes, some markets could face tough comps. But… I think a lot of it is flows. These names are (were?) rather well owned. In these cases, I think ppl want to own these stocks. They just don’t want to do it before 12/31. Worrying about weird price action the last 2 weeks of the year sucks enough as is...\n\nAnd unless you have a strong value orientation, the price action does not create a sense of urgency. Where you hunt for dislocations is going to be a function of your mandate. A pod probably isn't going to invest based on 2023 numbers at a COVID \"winner\".
