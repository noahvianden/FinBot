This was a direct lobbying & PR response by the fossil fuel industry to the growing success of Tesla.\n\nI'd guesstimate that about 70% of the anti-Elon and anti-Tesla false narratives originated from them.\n\nSomewhat ironically, the UAW, alarmed by the success of non-union Tesla, picked them up and spread them to liberals as well.
