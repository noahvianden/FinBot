Once he became famously rich, hatred against him drastically emerged and spread. \n\nWhat happened is that an organized anti-Tesla and anti-Elon smear campaign was launched by fossil fuel pressure groups at the end of 2015, financed by Koch Industries. This was a direct lobbying & PR response by the fossil fuel industry to the growing success of Tesla.\n\nI'd guesstimate that about 70% of the anti-Elon and anti-Tesla false narratives originated from them.\n\nSomewhat ironically, the UAW, alarmed by the success of non-union Tesla, picked them up and spread them to liberals as well. That's where Biden's UAW fetish and Tesla hostility originates from.", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "And it worked, the financing of the smear campaign by the oil industry delayed Tesla growth by at least a few years.

We’re at sky-high valuations right now predicated on expectations which are a mystery in the aggregate. My question is a rhetorical one. Nobody knows if the ramp is fully priced in.
