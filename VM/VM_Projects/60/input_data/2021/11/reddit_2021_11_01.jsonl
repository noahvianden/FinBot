They don't compete with Intel or Nvidia because they don't sell chips to anyone else, they're merely off the market for those solutions in the self driving chips (they still use a bunch of Intel and Nvidia chips in training, but Dojo will take that in house, you could assume though that they'll still be a customer for many years to come however).  \n \nRobotaxi competing with Uber and Lyft? Not this year and certainly not last year when they said there would be a million robotaxi's on the road, at some indeterminant point in the future yes.   \n \nInternal software making them a Salesforce and SAP competitor? Oh for crying out loud....\n \nPersonally I don't try to rely on these types of fluffy comparisons, the four gigafactories alone reaching capacity would crush their high PE multiple down, and their margins are more like Ferrari than Toyota and Ferrari only sold 9000 cars last year or something like that. And then I take FSD as an unexpected windfall whenever it happens. I think that's the best way to do it.  \n \nMy case ends up at 1200 base to 1600 bull next year without imagining them as an SAP competitor.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "You’re fundamentally right but what we’re witnessing is a “changing of the guards” in multiple industries and it’s coalescing around this one company.\n\nIt’s not really about the cars but rather the way they make the cars and the margins.  They’re nearing iPhone level margins on a heavy manufacturing type product.  Its pretty much unheard of and mind-boggling to supply chain and heavy industry logistics type folks.  And Tesla is doing it with the massive headwind of battery costs being a major factor in the price and expense of the  vehicles.  Someone at Vw said it best (Diess?) - Telsa takes 10 hours to make a car while VW takes 30 hours to make a car.  This is not an easy to solve problem.  If it was like “oh Tesla takes 29 hours to make a car while we take 30, let’s figure out rejiggering where we’re losing that hour” then their valuation is not warranted.  But in this case, Diess and others really have come up to the Grand Canyon’s edge and far off in the distance on the other side of the canyon, they see Elon building factories with what seems like a flick of a magic wand and cars that are 3 times more profitable and perform better and have months long wait lists in the hundreds of thousands come out the other side in 1 year.  To these guys it’s like magic - “how are they doing this?!?”\n\nThese old guard who are supposedly the best and biggest are STILL scratching their heads.  They can’t figure out the cars.  No one has tried to figure out battery cost reduction in earnest.  No one has figured out just how huge a moat the supercharger network is.  And even if they could figure out a supercharger network of their own, who’s going to use it?   They’re not selling nearly enough cars to justify it.  Leap of faith to build out 1,500 stations on a prayer?  With what money?  Remember they make less than 10% margin on their cars and have huge marketing budgets - how will they even afford a supercharger network?  Didn’t Ford announce a network a while back?  Where are those?\n\nTesla is an execution machine.  They say something.  It happens.  Over and over again.  The others say something and they half-ass it.  They dump it, spend a year or two coming up with “concept cars” with crazy features to try to get attention then go back to shipping more gas cars that less and less people want.\n\nNow take that whole scenario and add gas stations, energy generation and storage (residential and infrastructure scale), and who knows what else.\n\nThe valuation is rich for sure and this past month has been nuts definitely but I think it’s warranted as no one currently executes like Tesla and it’s highly doubtful most of the old guard will survive the transition - most will continue to merge and merge like whatever the hell Stelantis is.  They make essentially one powertrain and spend insane amounts of money making different shells (with lots of design teams) for different brands (which require huge marketing budgets in each market) where Tesla just has a launch event, puts stuff on their website, and Elon throws out a few tweets.  It’s literally night and day efficiency and cost wise.\n\nMy original thesis from 2017 when I bought in still holds.  No one executes like Tesla except maybe Apple.  This continues to be true to this day and looks like it will continue to be true for the foreseeable future (3-5yrs).  Let’s see if other pure electrics can scale up - Rivian seems to have a shot while Lucid doesn’t (too expensive, niche player at best if they survive).", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "What a great post.
