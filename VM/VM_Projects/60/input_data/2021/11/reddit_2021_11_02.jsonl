Analysis (Ticker: SID)\r  \nAn integrated steel company that is criminally undervalued\r  \n\r  \nA general understanding of the business.\r  \nCompanhia Sider√∫rgica Nacional is a Brazilian corporation incorporated in 1941. The Presidente Vargas Steelworks, located in the city of Volta Redonda, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, began its production of coke, pig iron and steel products in 1946, when they also incorporated the Casa de Pedra mine, located in the city of Congonhas, state of Minas Gerais, and the Arcos mine, located in the city of Arcos, state of Minas Gerais. The Casa de Pedra mine assures self-sufficiency in iron ore and the Arcos mine provides limestone and dolomite.\r  \n\r  \nCSN was privatized through a series of auctions held in 1993 and early 1994, through which the Brazilian government sold its 91% ownership interest. The company began trading on the NYSE in 1997. It has a market cap of \\~$6.1B with a share price of $4.46 at the time of writing.\r  \n\r  \nCurrent operations\r  \n\r  \nCSN is currently one of the largest integrated steel producers in Latin America in terms of crude steel production, they produced 11.3% of Brazil‚Äôs total crude steel production in 2020. They operate throughout the entire steel production chain, meaning they do everything from mining the ore to the sale of steel products. Their business can be separated in five segments: steel, mining, cement, logistics and energy.\r  \n\r  \nSteel\r  \n\r  \nCSN‚Äôs current annual crude steel capacity at their main facility is about 5.6 million tons. With an additional production capacity of 1.1 million tons of steel at their long steel segment in Germany. They obtain all their iron ore (and other products) from their own mines.\r  \n\r  \nMining activities\r  \n\r  \nAs previously mentioned, CSN obtains all their iron ore from their own mines. However, they sold 29.6 million tons, 34.9 million tons and 26.9 million tons of iron ore to third parties in 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. Their mines are strategically located within Brazil‚Äôs ‚ÄúIron Ore Quadrangle‚Äù within the state of Minas Gerais.\r  \n\r  \nLogistics\r  \n\r  \nCSN holds stakes in and operates many business that operate in transportation of goods. They operate a port terminal for containers, called TECON. They also have participation in 3 railways.\r  \n\r  \nCement\r  \n\r  \nCSN entered the cement industry in 2009 to take advantage of the synergy potential with their steelmaking business. They have gradually invested in their cement segment, with the most recent being the acquisition of the Brazilian business of LafargeHolcim for $1 billion. They also acquired Elizabeth Cimentos for a value of $214 million in July of this year.\r  \n\r  \nElectricity\r  \n\r  \nSteelmaking requires significant amounts of electricity to power rolling mills, production lines, hot metal processing, coking plants, cryogenic plant and auxiliary units. They produce most of the electricity from a power-plant at their main facility which secures them about 235 MW of capacity. In addition, they secure on average 188 MW through various equity interests.\r  \n\r  \nValuation & Growth\r  \nCSN isn‚Äôt a fancy EV company with revenue growing 1000% YOY, however they are growing fast compared to peers. Their earnings per share (EPS) has grown at an annual 38.3% over the past 5 years. They are also investing profits back into their own business through acquisitions. The insiders of this company are focused on growing the company considering they have a 54.5% stake.\r  \n\r  \nSome statistics about the valuation of CSN:\r  \n\r  \nP/E: 2.26\r  \nP/Free Cash Flow: 2.68\r  \nPEG: 0.58\r  \nReturn On Equity: 117.7%\r  \nReturn On Assets: 22.3%\r  \nReturn On Investment: 11.1%\r  \n\r  \nThis company has a price to free cash flow of 2.68. Which means with no growth at all it will have made its own market cap in profits in a little more than 2,5 years. They are also investing back heavily into their own business.\r  \n\r  \nThe average company in the steel-making industry has a P/E of 5.88, even though this isn‚Äôt a full-on steel company it is still noteworthy that it is trading at a P/E that is nearly 3 times lower than their main industry average. If we would value CSN at a P/E of 5.88 we would obtain a price of $11.88 indicating an increase of over 166%.\r  \n\r  \nThe estimated CAGR of the steel industry in the next 5 years is 4%, if we do a simple DCF analysis, with the assumptions of 4% growth over the next 5 years and a 2% growth rate in the years after, we get a fair enterprise value of $22.9B, compared to the current EV of $8.48B. This would also indicate a share price of around $12.00 (specifically $12.04).\r  \n\r  \nThe stock of CSN ($SID) has been more than cut in half in the recent months. This creates a wonderful buying opportunity for investors looking for value and growth. If you are interested in this company I would encourage you to read the 20-F (10-K for foreign companies) for yourself and decide if this is a good investment. After all I am just an individual and not a hedge fund, have fun investing!\r  \n\r  \nDisclaimer: Not investment advice", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": ">Past 3 months have been on a downhill slide.\n\nThe answer is here. There are two factors that brought the SID low, also all steel makers issue\n\n1. Chinese steel consumption 2) USA steel tariff.\n\nHowever the company stock price is dropped from $10.35 to $3.95 today.\n\nCompany wise, they are good with diversification, rev and inc. Tomorrow (or day after) they declare results. If they simply met the expectations, most likely, this is the time to turn back.\n\nOtherwise, I can hold it as they provide nice dividends every year and their P/E is too low (with old rev/income).\n\nSID, through the combining of its own mines, steel mill, railroads, ports and service and distribution centers within the scope of its operations, makes them the largest integrated steel-making complex in Latin America. Leader of the Brazilian steel industry, the company has the capacity to produce 5 million tonnes a year of crude steel. Steel, cement, iron ore is always on demand and keep growing further and further with growing economy.\n\nconsidering this, it looks to me very undervalued stock now.\n\nIf I buy now, chances of going up is higher than going down.

You essentially gave yourself a dollar per hour raise clicking a few buttons.\n\nNow, if you want to capitalize on volatility and don‚Äôt mind doing some research, find a value play. Ideally something you can understand logistically that you can make a strong argument for being undervalued. I.e a stock with a market cap of 200million that should be worth 1 billion. If the stars align, you could turn that $5000 into another $5000, $10,000, or more.\n\nHow do you do this? Research.

Hot ones right now are EV/battery tech and biotech/pharma because this is hot button rn. \n\nI.e: x company in battery tech has reported revenue potential of 4 billion a year. They are valued at 800 million market cap. They have released batteries and demoed them at conventions, but full scale operation is still being ironed out. It‚Äôs still a risky bet because if news comes out that reveals the company is fraudulent, or worse, the debt they accrued for start up funding leads them to bankruptcy or they have to dissolve shares to fund expenses, than you can lose most of your money*\n\nBut, if the company follows through on their goals and reports in earnings that they earned 200 million in Q1 2022, than their stock price will shoot through the roof because the market *may* assume their undervalued.\n\nAlso, look into insider transactions for these companies. Institutional buying is key to spotting winning bets. These institutions will easily buy more shares if the stock is winning. Smart investors put more money into winning plays and ride them on the way up.\n\n*you only lose when you sell assuming you have stocks. So with that being said, be ready to hold for longer than 2023 if need be. If you re looking for asymmetrical risk:reward you have to be willing to part with money. But by doing so with a large ETF, you‚Äôre waiting an equivalent amount of time for less rewards but also less risk.. just consider that YOUR RESEARCH is what determines the real risk of a company‚Äôs investment.
