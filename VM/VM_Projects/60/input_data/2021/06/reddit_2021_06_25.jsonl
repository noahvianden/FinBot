Here is the example from Pub 550:\n\n>**Holding Period and Loss Treatment Rules**  \n>  \n>The holding period of a position in a straddle generally begins no earlier than the date on which the straddle ends (the date you no longer hold an offsetting position). This rule does not apply to any position you held more than 1 year before you established the straddle.

On April 10, 2020, you sold the gold at a gain. Because the gold had been held for 1 year or less before the offsetting short position was entered into, the holding period for the gold begins on April 3, 2020, the date the straddle ended. Gain recognized on the sale of the gold will be treated as short-term capital gain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Workarounds**\n\n* Wheel in your Roth IRA/Traditional IRA/Individual 401(k).

I have learned quite a lot before ever entering my first option trade to the point of reading obscure rules. \n\nThe options mostly just lower the variability of my returns (until they don't). About 0.6% MTD of excess returns came from options. I only sell options when the premium is somewhat attractive. I think buying, holding cash, and rebuying the stock would perform similarly.\n\nIn my research I try to error on the side of caution. If I find something that I really don't like, I don't invest (even if I like the company otherwise). I like to tell myself that's my edge (until I get wiped out by the next pandemic (that hurt my Sharpe Ratio(!))).\n\nMy Sharpe-ratio used to be lower, but my position sizing (which is basically a kind of leverage) has improved and some last couple of trades turned out to match those of some hedge funds, but with lower entry points (which kind of confirmed the fundamentals of the trade). I don't use margin.
