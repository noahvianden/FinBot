That includes disaster recovery, which is hot sites, warm sites, and cold sites, where backups are stored and can roll back any data corruption or malware that may have taken place. When they're well prepared, these places are geographically separated and the cold sites are disconnected from any network. They're hardened against bombs and physical intrusion. They might lose recent data in the process of restoring it, but there's a lot of other mitigations that prevent a total loss of availability, such as having failover routes in case of network outages, multiple redundant servers that are geographically and virtually separated, creating accounts with the principal of least privilege and delegation of duties to remove the possibility that a single compromised account can do as much damage.\n\n\nBasically, if they have a good cybersecurity policy in place and pay those people well, any attack that will cause the kind of damage you're talking about would require multiple acts of war to accomplish. They lose more money (by the minute) by not having these protections if an attack would happen (because they make money by keeping the market open) than they would save by cutting corners. Class action lawsuits aside, the bigger players would each sue, individually,  for billions if they didn't have the necessary precautions in place and lost them big bucks.  One of the assurances you have about security in the stock market is that a lot of the unthinkably rich motherfuckers all have guns to each others' heads.
