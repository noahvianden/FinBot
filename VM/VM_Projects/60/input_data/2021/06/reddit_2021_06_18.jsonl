Nuclear is just pointless now. Solar is already cheaper per kWh on the generation side in many states and the price is still falling. Wind is also getting cheaper every year albeit its not as cheap as nuclear yet. Plus both have a much smaller up front cost thus you can build better redundancy and build closer to point of demand (less transmission needed and fewer points of failure).\n\nWith nuclear, not only do you need to mine the mineral but you also need to enrich it. Both non trivial. And then you need to build a big bass plant to use it and you create 1000 years of waste every few years. And oh yea, the plant requires crazy amounts of cooling, has a very high operational cost which only increases over time, and there is always the chance for major catastrophe especially if you hire Homer Simpson. None of these problem exist with wind or solar... not even if you have tons of battery banks. They are so easy to service, relatively speaking, that you can do it with high schoolers.\n\nThere is literally no upside nuclear except in areas where you have low sun hours and no wind (or usable rivers) and cannot possibly run long range transmission. But where is that exactly? Alaska perhaps? Definitely not Hawaii. So we are doing all this for Alaska alone? We cant just get a permit from Canada to run a transmission cable?\n\nBefore you say there are limits to batteries, ill cut you off. You are wrong. People who dont understand chemistry misinterpret the meaning of \"rare\" elements. Rare doesnt mean we dont have enough it. In fact we have plenty and not just plenty, but we also have alternatives especially in batteries. But \"rare\" is a relative term, not an absolute one.\n\nFor example, on earth, carbon is exceptionally rare compared to more common elements like Silicon or Aluminum. Does that mean we have a practical shortage of carbon? Did you know that Lithium is actually more common than Lead and about as common as Nitrogen... the same stuff you pee every day or so? We have plenty of Lithium and odds are we wont be needing it for long anyway. My money is on flow batteries for home and grid. Those will likely use Vanadium which is twice as common as Copper and 6x more common than Lithium but 3x \"rarer\" than Sulfur (see what I did there ;-p). Its just semantics. And we can still use other types of chemicals if we wanted to.\n\nAnd no, recycling batteries and panels is not an issue. The issue is tooling recyclers because they arent set up for it yet, not the actual process. The process is obvious and well known and highly efficient. Most everything in both panels and batteries can be recycled with little waste and they are not very toxic either, comparatively speaking, to nuclear.\n\nJust my 2 cents.

Solar and Wind are just temporary distractions. They are like a child's toy in comparison.

Why do you suppose we get regional blackouts sometimes? You think its because of down lines? It isnt. You think they ran out of coal? LoL.

Not with fuel based generators like coal or uranium. What do you suppose happens to all the excess?\n\nSo in other words, we had to figure out ways to make things work despite being imperfect. The solution was to overbuild. This is also how you handle solar/wind. The answer is to simply over build. You build twice as much generators and storage than you need and you add more as needed. In the past the cost was prohibitive... what happens when cost becomes trivial?\n\nSorry man but I cant see any future in nuclear. Its a total dead end.

Its like asking a car salesman what they think of Teslas no dealership model... many still believe it will fail... lol.\n\nNext, if you havent heard of a scientist telling you solar + wind can overtake nuclear its probably because you dont hang around science folks. Nor do fund managers. Well you have one now telling you that in about 10 years, wind + solar will likely reach nuclear capacity in the USA.\n\nAnd thats just the USA. Worldwide, this will be done in about 5 because other countries are ahead of us (China... cough). You do realize nuclear is just like 10% of worldwide generation right? And that wind + solar is already 7% and growing by leaps and bounds... this isnt even a comparison. 5 years ago we were generating about 700TW from solar, today its about 1800TW... In the same time, nuclear went from about 6500TW to 6900TW... Im not even counting wind. If you go back 10 years, the numbers are even worse. Back then we barely had about 100TW of solar and we actually had more nuclear than we do now...\n\nThe death rates are silly. I mean, that should be obvious. Any death from solar is likely due to, sadly, working on roofs. This wont happen with giant solar farms. Can you imagine the death rate for nuclear if people did it at home?\n\nYour efficiency numbers are outdated. Check again. Solar, when purchased wholesale rather than retail, has been cheaper than nuclear for well over 5 years and running in sunny states. It is now A LOT cheaper due to advances in panels and can be brought to parity with nuclear even in less sunny states. Now the problem is that when you include batteries, then the price climbs above nuclear but for how long?\n\nPanels keep becoming more efficient and cheaper every year by about 2% and batteries are in their infancy... i mean 5 years ago it would cost well over $1/Wh for battery storage, and next year Ford is releasing a F150 with likely well over 100kWh for about $40k... 2021 Teslas model 3 is about 82kWh for $40k. The prices are in free fall and the tech is no where near done in terms of improvement. We probably have another 10 years for panel innovation before plateau assuming absolutely no new breakthroughs and another 20-30 years for batteries. In 10 years, solar + batteries will be so cheap that they would even make sense in low sun areas.\n\nFurther, you need to account for current cost of nuclear plants... this is something people dont consider. Nuclear plant cost is not what it used to be and many calculations used today are based on those old costs. Its possible that old plants might be cheaper than solar/wind (not always) but you cannot, in any way, build a new one that will be cheaper today. Why do you think utilities arent rushing out to build them even in low regulation states? Yet they are all building solar/wind farms and battery banks in droves...\n\nI have no idea where you got that China and Euro info about them ditching solar for nuclear. Please give a citation. Hell just today there was a report of damaged fuel rods in China lol. Further China already generates twice as much from solar/wind than they do nuclear.
