{"title": "What is TWNK?", "selftext": "# Enter TWNK; Hostess Brands\n\nYou're looking at a company that is profitable, has glowing ratings, and is growing. \n\n*not to mention a \\~17% Short Interest, but we'll get to that later...*\n\nLet's take a deep look.\n\n# A Brief Financial Checkup\n\n[EPS, revenue, and cashflow +Projections compared to the industry average](https://preview.redd.it/65s21baltj471.png?width=1564&format=png&auto=webp&s=34622d076187915fa11aafc04579aa0c16d40001)\n\nAs pictured above, TWNK's growth has not only beaten the industry average, but absolutely left it in the dust. The only areas that lag behind the industry are future projections, but even those look good.\n\nHere are the highlights:\n\n* 12-Trailing-Month revenue Growth: More than double industry average.\n* Cash Flow Growth (5yr): +200%\n* EPS compared to same Quarter Last Year: **+850%** (this growth isn't just because of the pandemic, as in industry average is just +24.16%)\n\n# Profit \n\n[TWNK margins vs industry margins](https://preview.redd.it/7ah86nipwj471.png?width=1572&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7f6a76157ec762a4cebec3a195ddd03dfd218e9)\n\nHere is something to note: TWNK's margins are some of the strongest in the industry, mostly placing in the 80th percentile or better. TWINK about matches or beats the industry average across the board; just take a look for yourself!\n\n# Let's Look At Earnings\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TWNK EPS & Share price since Q2 2019 \\(ADJUSTED EPS\\)](https://preview.redd.it/5hubjmdnyj471.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=1281c2d46a32a1925d71b19a31b847399a1a6cbb)\n\n TWNK has been beating estimates for years, not to mention their incredible performance in 2020 and continued strength in 2021. Even though the pandemic they have never underperformed and bounced back like a champ. \n\n# TWNK the stock\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TWNK share price since June 2019](https://preview.redd.it/9naupxk60k471.png?width=1292&format=png&auto=webp&s=e37b800816d3391c1dc70db76508dcc1a4e2b1fe)\n\nThe Stock price has ripped since the pandemic crash, backed by consistently meeting or beating earnings expectations. Even after this incredible run, TWNK is **still undervalued.** \n\n# Valuation\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TWNK valuation ratios](https://preview.redd.it/hguzxhqy0k471.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7bb08f66d038bb8a49c27e2691b7edffc5feeb0)\n\n* Price to Book: **1.30 (This will even have the fella's at** r/ValueInvesting **salivating for some TWNK)**\n* Price to Sales (12mo trailing): **1.98**\n* Price to Earnings (12mo trailing): **23.74** \n\nAt first glance these numbers don't look all too impressive. Many of these are close to the industry average (Excluding P/B). But for a company that has much better growth & margins than the industry average, not to mention incredible share-price momentum, I'm surprised these ratios aren't higher.\n\n# Smart Money Says...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Some analyst ratings of TWNK](https://preview.redd.it/ri4mypx53k471.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcd70cdc9b9dfa12440371f2710caf32f467c714)\n\nHere's a snapshot of what \"smart\" money thinks of TWNK. Ratings show neutral or better, with every rating posted within the past 30 days. (except for Morgan Stanley, I think old-man Stanley dropped his glasses).  \n\n# Options Demand \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Highest call options flow of the day \\(vs. average call volume\\)](https://preview.redd.it/6pf568057k471.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=29d6550531e39bd06a865e2db0fa0e8a43491aee)\n\nHere's a simple yet interesting chart; top Call options volume vs avg. call volume. Compared to it's daily average, TWNK call volume has **exploded** today (June 10th) vs its average call volume. Someone (or many people), is loading up on call options, with TWNK finishing 9th on the list (just ahead of WISH and a little behind WEN), I only wonder why.... \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Twinkie's Shorts\n\n[Short interest as posted on NASDAQ.com](https://preview.redd.it/icd1gdhh4k471.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbe2e4740119b5fc38cecd7cab0a12445b72b7e7)\n\nEven with juicy fundamentals and share-price growth, shorts are loading up on TWNK. Short interest as of May 28th is 17% [NASDAQ reports](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/twnk/short-interest) , and [shown on FinViz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TWNK&ty=c&p=d&b=1) High short interest is usually never a good sign for a stock. However, TWNK is a strong company and strong stock, so I'm not sure why there is 17% float short.\n\n# TL;DR\n\nTWNK (Hostess Brands) is a great company and has amazing momentum. Call options and short volume his been rising, but only one of these have a good reason to do so.\n\n**Positions:** I currently have 5 shares of TWNK \n\n*I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice.

It is a meme stock that has barely even memed so far\n2. 6% GDP Growth + international demand - starving for steel.\n3. It is a value stock - market fleeing to value\n4. It is a commodity stock - market wants an inflation hedge\n5. It is a steel stock: we can't just ramp up new steel plants willy nilly.\n6. They are going to make a bucket of money - for sure this year and a strong market for at least 3-5 years in my opinion.\n7. They are protected by steel tariffs that aren't going away.\n8. China wants to go green, and reducing their dirty cheap steel production is one of the best ways for them to accomplish this\n9. They are a PRIMARY PRODUCER of steel which is vital to our national interests. They aren't just melting scrap.\n10. They are FULLY INTEGRATED producing all of their own Iron for their steel mills. They even have a cutting hedge HBI plant (produces things that other steel makers need and for themselves. super high value)\n11. Their CEO is a fucking badass who hates shorts: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcagi2icXaU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcagi2icXaU)\n12.

They bought AK Steel and Mittal Steel's U.S. operations in 2020 - amazing timing. #1 steel producer in the USA. Edit: This will also give them more negotiating power.\n13. I am comfortable holding shares for 10 years. I don't care if it doesn't rip. If the stock Memes it is merely a bonus for me and faster time to value. I see this as very limited downside and massive upside.\n14. Edit BONUS: NEGOTIATING POWER AS COMBINED ENTITY: From Q1 Earnings Call: \"Another thing is that the real competition for the more sophisticated grades of steel that AK Steel, and Cleveland-Cliffs owned AK Steel for alone for almost a year. The only real competition was AM USA. So now we own both. So the automotive clients, they have already realized that. And they are no longer negotiating with a beggar. They negotiate with the supplier that treats them with a lot of respect and demands respect in retrospect, so we are doing great. \" - LG\n15. Edit BONUS 2: Auto chip shortage seems to be easing. This will help CLF. Their massive profits will also trail a bit as contracts get renegotiated. In other words Q1 was just an appetizer.\n16.

This change lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.47%.\n\n Heading into today, shares of the mining company had gained 16.27% over the past month, outpacing the Basic Materials sector's loss of 2.29% and the S&P 500's loss of 0.12% in that time.\n\n CLF will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, CLF is projected to report earnings of $1.18 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 480.65%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for  revenue is projecting net sales of $4.75 billion, up 334.97% from the year-ago period.\n\n For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.45 per share and revenue of $18.09 billion, which would represent changes of +2517.65% and +237.83%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\n It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for CLF. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.\n\n Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\n The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over  the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 12.66% higher. CLF is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\n Digging into valuation, CLF currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 5.22. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 11.34, which means CLF is trading at a discount to the group.\n\n Also, we should mention that CLF has a PEG ratio of 0.19. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Mining-Miscellaneous industry currently had  an average PEG ratio of 2.13 as of yesterday's close.\n\n The Mining-Miscellaneous industry is part of the Basic Materials sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 175, putting it in the bottom 32% of all 250+ industries.\n\n The Zacks Industry Rank includes is listed in order from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors.
