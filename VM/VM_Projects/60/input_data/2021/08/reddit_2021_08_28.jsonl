That all being said, I've only ever seen a delineation between maintenance and growth capex in defensive industries like industrials, energy, utilities, etc, so I might just be pedantic here, but a good detail to highlight regardless. \n\n* Except you've got a problem here - you're ignoring the cost of financing if you've raised any debt to fund your capital budget. Hard to evaluate your Owners Equity metric if half of it is getting eaten up by debt service obligations (debt holders get to recoup their entire capital outlay before you see a dollar as an equity holder). See this a lot in industry with sponsor-backed private companies that will max out their leverage and distribute all of their FCF for the period in the form of a dividend to the PE shop (this is called a dividend recap - helps their IRR metrics)\n\n* FCF is a solid metric used in industry (I work for an investment bank) since it basically tells you the cash your generating per period to freely spend as you please, after paying creditors and funding an internal capital budget by backing out interest payments and capex. \n\n* However, it doesn't tell you much in a vacuum (e.g. AMZN generates $5 FCF per share vs MSFT generating $10 FCF per share is comparing apples and oranges). Even in aggregate amounts, it's not super helpful to you as a potential investor evaluating asset allocation within your portfolio.\n\n* What **should** be the focus is *how much FCF are you entitled to as an investor per capital dollar invested* --> e.g. what does it cost me on a per share basis to receive $1 of FCF? Or to put another way, what valuation is the market giving me in price per share for each dollar of FCF generated per period?\n\n* [Example here](https://imgur.com/a/GKbUh34) - so for every dollar you're investing in AMZN nets you roughly $0.02 of FCF for every dollar you invest (FCF/Equity Value). However, for every dollar you sink into GOOGL or APPL gives you double that, or around $0.04 of FCF for every dollar you invest. I should note that it's presented in Factset as the inverse / as a multiple (Market Cap / FCF), but for illustration purposes, we're looking at FCF yield (FCF / Market Cap).\n\n* So what does this tell you? It tells you that the market is forecasting a greater degree of growth in AMZN (probably due to the greater scope of offerings AMZN gives you relative to GOOGL or APPL). Or the market is wrong and over valuing / overestimating the future growth of AMZN's FCF (or undervaluing Amazon's peers). Either way, this is probably the most widely accepted form of back-of-the-envelop valuation that's generally used in industry.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "> Or the market is wrong and over valuing / overestimating the future growth of AMZN's FCF\n\nThat's where the money is.\n\nCompanies with high valuations, that execute flawlessly, then the market sort of loses interest, until these wildly over valued companies become almost reasonably valued.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "This is awesome!
