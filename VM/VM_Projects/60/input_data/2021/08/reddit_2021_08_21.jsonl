{"title": "Smooth brain question about using CSP to boost collateral", "selftext": "  \n\nSome setup\n\nI am looking at $7 put that I could sell to open for 6.35 (635 total premium). Obviously, it is a risky stock and will expire ITM. But it doesn't expire until January 20th, 2023. \n\nThe question\n\nIf I use the $635 premium to sell to open more $7 puts, I could reach the $25,000 pattern day threshold with $3,000 of my own money. So, is it possible to treat this as a de facto 16-month subscription to day trading for $3,000? \n\nI'd have to sell about 35 of these puts. The underlying asset is trading at $0.7 so the 3,500 shares would be worth $2,450 if they expire at the current price. If this stock holds it could of as buying a day trading subscription for $550. This stock could get delisted this February if it doesn't get back over $1 though. If that happens it will tank, and I could be out most of the $3,000. \n\nAnother downside is having my cash tank hard at assignment. I'd drop most of that 25K so I would have to clear up any margin I am using before it expires. \n\nFor risks I know I could lose most of my initial $3k. If I lose track of any margin, I am using I could set my self up for a margin call at the expiration. I also probably won’t be able to afford to buy to close early on most of the puts since all the premium is going back into selling puts. So, I won’t be able to capitalize on any runups the stock has to close them at a profit. \n\nIs there any risk I am missing?", "id": "p90s6k", "created_utc": 1629585241.0, "score": 7, "upvote_ratio": 0.64, "num_comments": 62, "comments": [{"body": "You’re looking at SNDL, aren’t you?", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Check out the big brain on Brad!", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "English motha fucka do you speak it!?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "What ain't no country I eva heard of.

It’s not the infinite money glitch. The big considerations are 1. that you absolutely won’t be able to close your positions if you use up the entire premium selling more csp’s (so you’re locked in) and 2. If/when you do get assigned, if the price is anywhere near its current level, you sacrifice 90% of the value of your portfolio ($7->.70). Not to mention there’s like no extrinsic value in that play. Basically, by seeing this through, you’re ending a year and half with a 5% increase. With inflation currently, you’d be losing money, haha.\n\nOk, the above is just related to this as a play in itself, however, to your real question about having a $25k account? Yeah, I do think you could find a loophole into unlimited day-trades if you sell enough.\n\nEdit: I didn’t check the chain but I follow sndl pretty closely.

Options leverage cannot be used for day trading. \n\nSummary of the Day-Trading Margin Requirements\nThe rules adopt the term \"pattern day trader,\" which includes any margin customer that day trades (buys then sells or sells short then buys the same security on the same day) four or more times in five business days, provided the number of day trades are more than six percent of the customer's total trading activity for that same five-day period. Under the rules, a pattern day trader must maintain minimum equity of $25,000 on any day that the customer day trades. The required minimum equity must be in the account prior to any day-trading activities. If the account falls below the $25,000 requirement, the pattern day trader will not be permitted to day trade until the account is restored to the $25,000 minimum equity level.\n\nThe rules permit a pattern day trader to trade up to four times the maintenance margin excess in the account as of the close of business of the previous day. If a pattern day trader exceeds the day-trading buying power limitation, the firm will issue a day-trading margin call to the pattern day trader. The pattern day trader will then have, at most, five business days to deposit funds to meet this day-trading margin call. Until the margin call is met, the day-trading account will be restricted to day-trading buying power of only two times maintenance margin excess based on the customer's daily total trading commitment. If the day-trading margin call is not met by the fifth business day, the account will be further restricted to trading only on a cash available basis for 90 days or until the call is met.\n\nIn addition, the rules require that any funds used to meet the day-trading minimum equity requirement or to meet any day-trading margin calls remain in the pattern day trader's account for two business days following the close of business on any day when the deposit is required. The rules also prohibit the use of cross-guarantees to meet any of the day-trading margin requirements.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you very much.
