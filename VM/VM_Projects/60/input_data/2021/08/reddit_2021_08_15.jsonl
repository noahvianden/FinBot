{"title": "I scanned over 150 charts this weekend. Here are some good setups I found to BTFD (or sell CSPs): PTON, CRWD, SHOP, GRWG, PUBM", "selftext": "# Last Week's Review\n\nAnyone who's been following the last several editions of my posts, out of the most recent 25 tickers from the watchlist only one ticker is down more than 10%, SKLZ, which was noted as a risky earnings play. The majority of the other tickers are up between 1-5% while the market has returned roughly 2% to investors during the same time-period.\n\nThis doesn't include the multiple home-runs and bread-winners of the group that eventually reached **20-30% return**. These tickers are: **TLRY, CLF, PLTR, AMD, and FUBO**. I'm always asked when do I sell these positions? My answers are usually along the lines of:\n\n* If the stock is in an uptrend, I'll sell when I'm up 20-30% and attempt to buy back in on a dip.\n* If the stock has been consolidating or trading within a channel, I'll usually hold until I meet my profit target or if the trend breaks to the downside, creating a down-trend.\n* If the chart looks like it's bottoming and creating a cup-and-handle technical pattern I'll hold until the cup is formed. There is always a chance the bottom falls out and stock drops further, which would change my attitude toward the position and force me to sell.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat's mentioned above are my profit and technical targets. There are also fundamentals that affect my position. For example, I was in on WISH with a $9 cost basis. If you go over the earnings call or transcript you'll hear the CEO say how net user retention was way down, lower than they expected it to be. Even though the company is still doing over 2.5 billion revenues TTM and only valued at $2.5 billion itself, I did not like the tone management used on the conference call. WISH has the potential to take off given the revenues they've achieved, but with how much they are spending on advertising compared to their customer's retention is somewhat alarming. My mantra is \"when in doubt, get out\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRemember, these tickers I mention are my \"swing-trade\" list and I'm not looking to hold for more than a week to 6 months (6 months is still long for swing trades), but sometimes you need to be patient. I play roughly 60% of the tickers I mention depending if I'm able to get in on the setup or if I missed my opportunity, like if the stock opens +10% Monday morning and I didn't get in the week before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Chart Guidelines & Terms\n\nI use the term \"meme stock\" loosely as these aren't necessarily meme companies. I really mean that the ticker has a HIGH PROBABILITY to trend on social media and the stock price could be affected by social sentiment. The watchlist I give is usually comprised of tickers that have taken a breather after getting too hot from a social aspect.\n\nMoving along, I like to look at my charts from a risk-reward perspective.\n\n\"Red Zones\" are high-risk lotto plays.\n\n\"Orange Zones\" are a bit of a mixed bag between being too hot or early in the trend.\n\n\"Green Zone\" is where I try to buy. These trades are never guaranteed (nothing in life is), but from a risk-to-reward point of view they are in my favor.\n\nAs always, this is not financial advice or a recommendation to buy or sell a stock. Please do your own research before entering any positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Meme List\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Peloton - PTON**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tszo2w1udlh71.png?width=2558&format=png&auto=webp&s=58ad409c7a5919193f56a308b4b35f6171c6315d\n\nPeloton is back on my list this week and I DCA'd more shares on Friday's dip. The stock reversed down to $110 and earnings are coming up within the next 10 trading days. It's hitting soft support level at $110. In my opinion there will be hard support at $100 and $95 levels, but potential upside on positive earnings back to $150 area for a favorable risk/reward.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**CrowdStrike - CRWD**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m2p25zmudlh71.png?width=2556&format=png&auto=webp&s=07bf2a2728b94191ee8258c68e5f7451df2e569c\n\nCRWD is a cyber-security company that has seen success throughout covid. The stock price slide 8% last week to provide a potential dip opportunity on this uptrend. The stock is up 30% since May and these pullbacks are healthy for the share price to consolidate before another leg up. CRWD trades at a rich valuation compared to competitors, but has seen outstanding growth. Earnings are coming up August 31 and could be volatile going into the next 2 weeks of trading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Shopify - SHOP**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mvek07bvdlh71.png?width=2556&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8230dbee34a0419a3d44d2284eb3a369d732d36\n\nThe e-commerce giant has been trading between $1,100 and $1,500 since December of 2020. The share price has touched back down from it's short-lived high of $1,650 against the 50 SMA of $1,500. If the uptrend remains in-tact I think we will get another bounce and continue to the upside, otherwise we could see further support at the $1,400 level and re-evaluate then.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The BTFD List\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PubMatic - PUBM**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tpllioyvdlh71.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8454acc388a3cf6471f5284cd69759168244de1\n\nPUBM is a cloud infrastructure platform that allows real-time programmatic advertising transactions for internet content creators and advertisers. Revenues have been hit from the newly introduced regulations on 3rd-party tracking cookies, affecting most advertisers. PUBM may remain volatile for another 2 quarters until management is able to provide insight on adjustments they will be able to make going forward. For those with an appetite for risk, the current $30 support level may prove to be a dip-buying opportunity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Growth Generation - GRWG**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gs9dnpowdlh71.png?width=2554&format=png&auto=webp&s=7dc89e602fcc12f6f293caf8d3b1b8deca16922f\n\nGrowthGeneration offers hydroponics and organic gardening equipment, mainly for the cannabis industry. GRWG just posted solid earnings with better than expected revenue growth. The downside? Analysts are forecasting Q3 and Q4 of 2021 to be softer than expected and the share price has dropped 30% last week. GRWG is trading back to December 2020 levels, almost 9 months of price appreciation destroyed in several days. Perhaps an over-reaction?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope you all enjoyed this edition.
