It's a guide on how tendies are good for your health.\n\n**Table of Contents**\n\n* Introduction\n* EUA vs FDA Full Approval\n* Time to get cuckold, $MRNA, $PFE just took the 100mg Viagra and is your wife's boyfriend\n\n**I. Introduction**\n\nOn 8/20/21, during after hours, $PFE had two breaking news:\n\n1. EU marketing authorization of its Xeljanz, treatment against arthritic conditions ([source](https://www.yahoo.com/now/xeljanz-tofacitinib-citrate-receives-marketing-203100843.html))\n2. FDA Full Approval of $PFE COVID vaccines ([source](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/20/full-approval-for-pfizer-covid-vaccine-could-come-from-fda-monday-report-says.html))\n\nSurely, these headlines are fuel for our rocket ships to the moon? Maybe, maybe not. Headlines shouldn't convince you to invest in something, otherwise you'd pull out on that $CLOV Shitenburg piece right? (wink wink) You should understand what the fluffs are so that you have full conviction on the play. This discussion is to accomplish exactly that, to point out the important differences between an FDA Full Approval vs. an EUA and why it's time for $PFE to fucking fly.\n\n**II. EUA vs FDA Full Approval**\n\n* **EUA**: emergency use authorization is when the FDA requires only half of the samples to be monitored for 2 months post-vaccinations (i.e. taking a short-cut or reading a WSB DD to gamble 100% of my savings)\n* **FDA Full Approval**: is when the FDA requires ALL of the samples to be monitored for a minimum of six months post-vaccinations, including examinations beyond the vaccination side effects such as manufacturing and inspection qualities (i.e. doing u/DeepFuckingValue level of DD before investing)\n\nIf the examples are insufficient, an EUA is like your mum telling you tendies are good for you while an FDA full approval is like a doctor telling you the tendies are so good, you shouldn't just stick it down your throat, but also up your ass and your wife boyfriend's ass.\n\nWhat's the point of comparing the two? Well, it's simple. All COVID vaccines as of date, have not received the FDA Full Approval including $MRNA, $JNJ, etc. but $PFE will this upcoming week. Do what you will with this information but speculations from my end is that, with a fully approved vaccine, I'd imagine $PFE will be mandated for the 30% unvaccinated U.S. adults (I mean, google \"vaccine passports\" and the timing of this approval is just too perfect) and $PFE will be distributed globally to countries that desperately need vaccines (e.g. VP of US, Kamala, traveling to Vietnam and SEA, presumably to discuss distributions to the desperate lockdowned regions).\n\n**III. Time to get cuckold, $MRNA, $PFE just took the 100mg Viagra and is your wife's boyfriend**\n\nThrough the entirety of the 2020 outbreak and our recovery in 2021, $MRNA took the spotlight. Here are three reasons why $PFE will overcome the shadows of $MRNA:\n\n* With $MRNA low floats and high volatility (evident by a beta of 1.49), $PFE laggard ass got cuckold with its low beta of .67 (almost as low as Great Grandfather Buffet's favorite darling, $KO, with a beta of .63). So, for $PFE to shine, it'll need a similar price action as $MRNA, right? Well, so how the fuck does $PFE get there with 5.6B floats? With the aforementioned headlines. After the two breaking news dropped, $PFE made the \"V formation\" in after-hours on 8/20/2021, V for 100mg Viagra erection movement; a formation defined by yours truly.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r2we4s7uiti71.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce681e5733e4ee3c58fc1ec70dba4b3129093af9\n\n* Again, another speculation, but let's play a game: who between $PFE, $MRNA, $JNJ would be the most likely to get FDA full approval before everyone? You'd probably guessed $MRNA a month ago. It's also possible that investors thought that $MRNA of all vaccine players would have the highest likelihood to receive the full FDA approval before others. Well, the tides have turned and $PFE just won this arm race.\n* As $PFE get the full approval announcement, $MRNA gets a bad data news regarding the side effects of its COVID vaccines and is rumored to be probed by the FDA ([source](https://www.barrons.com/articles/covid-vaccine-side-effect-myocarditis-moderna-pfizer-51629474879)).

{"title": "BioNTech & Moderna - Vaccine/mRNA unicorns", "selftext": "  \n\n**BioNTech & Moderna - Vaccine/mRNA unicorns**\n\nI was motivated to make this DD post because while these vaccine stocks have been crazy hot over the past year, they don't get much attention on WSB which is a bit surprising.  These aren't for the faint of heart, but traders looking for volatility, you won't need a blue pill to get hard.\n\nI will try to highlight some of the key differences and you can make a choice of which you prefer.  My personal choice is BioNTech, reason being they are much cheaper when comparing financial metrics, and also because I think their vaccine is the best in terms of safety and efficacy.  It is also what I'm vaccinated with, and the 5G reception has been great.\n\n**Pfizer & BioNTech partnership**\n\nMost folks refer to BioNTech‚Äôs vaccine as ‚ÄòPfizer‚Äô, but the vaccine actually belongs to BioNTech, but licensed to Pfizer with profit split down the line in most regions as well as milestone payments to BioNTech ($748 million).  There is also a small equity investment in BioNTech by Pfizer.  Pfizer was interested in acquiring BioNTech, but the owners have no interest in selling. \n\n**Making history as the first FDA approved mRNA vaccine**\n\nIn recent news from Friday, Pfizer/BioNTech is to become the first fully FDA approved vaccine as early as this Monday. First mover advantage is key to locking down market share, as well as advancing the mRNA vaccine booster approvals. With the mRNA technology platform vetted with an FDA approval, Pfizer/BioNTech will be moving yet further ahead of the competition.  Mandates will start soon as this is approved, and BioNTech will be the first choice.  Also, BioNTech is in more arms, and the boosters are advised to follow the primary shots so they will also lock up a lot of doses.\n\nModerna approval is said to be several weeks away, so they aren't far behind either if things go their way.\n\nComparing BioNTech and Moderna based on market cap and financial metrics, Moderna currently has a higher valuation/multiple even though BioNTech has double the earnings per share. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fundamentals](https://preview.redd.it/87y6mjkiuti71.png?width=802&format=png&auto=webp&s=081f5a5bcff8974ec6fc8721bf1f60d91dcbe7be)\n\nFor the next ten years, the COVID vaccine revenues will be the drivers for these companies. I won‚Äôt go into the scientific differences between the mRNA vaccines, as this is WSB and I‚Äôm not epidemiologist or scientist. \n\nWe know both vaccines are very similar and effective but differ by dosage (Pfizer having 30 micrograms vs Moderna having 100 micrograms per dose). Both of these will require boosters for the foreseeable future with what looks like 8 month intervals (though Moderna may have longer durability due to the dosage). Science supports this since the virus will continue to mutate. Countries such as Canada have already ordered boosters for the entire population out to 2024. \n\n**Ownership and Insiders**\n\nBioNTech is 50% owned by the Str√ºngmann brothers, who seeded the company. Next the CEO Ugur Sahin owns around 17% of the company. This means 67% of the stock is basically out of the picture. These guys have not sold a single share as this has run up from single dollars to $465.\n\nInstitutional ownership as of the last report was approximately 17%. This means that 84% of the shares (out of 241 million) are not being actively traded, leaving a paltry 38.5 million shares. \n\nModerna while having more shares outstanding has a very strong institutional ownership base of 64% of float, and 10% by insiders, so 74% of the shares are spoken for. Since Moderna is an S&P component (BioNTech is a German company, listed as an ADR so does not qualify for it), it gets more volume and institutional interest. In the last six months, about 11 million shares have been sold by insiders, which is not unusual given how well it has performed. \n\nFrom a share structure perspective, I think the low float and high ownership by the founders of BioNTech make it possible for more upside, but both are currently Wall Street darlings, and Moderna gets more attention in the media.\n\n**Marketshare**\n\nPfizer distributes the vaccine to 165 countries around the world. The net profit from the sale of the vaccine is split 50/50 between Pfizer and BioNTech. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[More primary shots = more boosters](https://preview.redd.it/7v8rld7puti71.png?width=798&format=png&auto=webp&s=27e11bdcc618de17192efb61d7b2b0defc7660ee)\n\nBioNTech separately has a deal with China based Fosun Pharmaceuticals to distribute in Asia. Fosun is to start production in China at the end of August upon administrative approval (regulator approval already happened last month), eventually producing up to 200 million doses a month to supply Asia. Pfizer/BioNTech did not take US government money to develop their vaccine, which makes it an exception. BioNTech did get $445 million from Germany for the development.\n\nModerna has a smaller reach currently than Pfizer/BioNTech in terms of global distribution and have had some issues scaling fast enough to meet contracts.  However, they are expecting to produce 800-900 million doses for 2021, and up to 3 billion in 2022. Moderna had significant funding by the US Government ($6 Billion), so they are not in a good position to attempt raising prices in the US (though I have heard they may have recently, not sure).  \n\nPfizer/BioNTech wins the distribution hands down, as they were first to launch and scale their production in mass. Also in the US, the BioNTech is able to be given to ages 12 and up, whereas Moderna is currently 18 and over. This could change, but recent reports suggest BioNTech is perhaps a better choice for younger folks due to fewer side effects compared to Moderna, perhaps due to the difference in dosage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mquq3u4tuti71.png?width=681&format=png&auto=webp&s=cca23b35d7b1f16116f780d58fa930d6e2e6657a\n\n**Pipeline**\n\nFor pipeline, they both have a lot of treatments under development based on mRNA technology. They both are going to be very cash rich, and will have no issues funding and expediting their candidates with no financing concerns for the foreseeable future. Now that they‚Äôve proven mRNA delivery technology and safety, they are both targeting blockbuster drugs (cancer, HIV).  They will also grow via acquisitions.\n\nBioNTech pipeline has a heavy focus on oncology, 21 or 27 of their candidate are cancer related. They also have another partnership with Pfizer to develop a flu shot which started Phase 1 earlier this year. BioNTech has one drug in the phase 2 stage - BNT122 for metastatic melanoma.\n\nModerna has a more diversified pipeline (HIV, Zika, Flu). They just started human trial of their HIV vaccine.  They also have a treatment for cytomegalovirus that is expected to begin phase 3 trials in 2021, and in phase 2 have a cancer vaccine mRNA-4157, to be given in combination with Merck‚Äôs Keytruda.\n\n**Technicals**\n\nBioNTech has consenus of $320.44 and Moderna $276.45, but these includes some older targets which have yet to be updated.  BioNTech has had multiple upgrades over the past two weeks ($450 Canaccord, $433 Goldman).  Moderna has recent targets of $425 by Jeffries and $461 by Goldman.  \n\nBoth of these stocks are extremely volatile.  They went parabolic in recent months and got overbought.  They both fell 30% from recent highs in a matter of days, but are now consolidating and inching up again. The selling of these were not based on any fundamental news, but technically the vertical move couldn't be sustained. Earnings blowout and some criticism by some analysts on valuation are mentioned as catalysts, but I think they just went up too far, too fast. This is a run of the mill correction, but I suspect it has now run it's course.  It's given a great opportunity for new investors to get in at a discount to recent highs.\n\nKeep in mind they both have high correlation to each other, so they almost always move together, but MRNA has outperformed BNTX as of late.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1tdbel5uuti71.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=35e47c33df3823c1865bf34a98a4ccecd8ee5154\n\nI believe both of these will at least retest all time highs (464 for BNTX, and 497 for MRNA), possibly go even higher if we get another variant after the delta that requires further changes to the vaccine (this is probably more likely that we'll want to admit).  The pipeline for both is promising, and these trade more like tech stocks than biotech since mRNA has proven with the COVID vaccine that it will revolutionize the industry and both of these companies are at the forefront.\n\n**Risks:**  The biggest risk is the variants mutate to something less deadly, less warranting booster shots. In my opinion these stocks will likely peak then decline sometime in early - mid 2022 as the pandemic changes into an epidemic.  There is also risk of competition, but I think these have such a commanding lead, I don't see anyone choosing another vaccine over these, given the billions of doses and FDA approvals they will have ahead of the competition.  Folks are turning down Astrazeneca and JNJ, willing to risk waiting unvaccinated for one of the aforementioned mRNA vaccines.\n\nTDLR for those who can‚Äôt be bothered to read:\n\n**In a nutshell:** Both are great plays on COVID and mRNA, especially now that boosters are now seen as durable reoccurring revenues (though they are expected to decline after 2022). Like the flu, we‚Äôll be getting COVID shots many years from now based on science and history (flu pandemic of 1918, we‚Äôre still getting shots due to variants and waning immunity, the same issues plaguing us with COVID).  However, BioNTech is fundamentally much better valued than Moderna as the EPS is double that of Moderna, and they have the first mover advantage and brand awareness (due to Pfizer).  \n\n**Disclosure:** I‚Äôm not a finance professional, just a retail trader. I own BNTX via call options and have no position in MRNA.
