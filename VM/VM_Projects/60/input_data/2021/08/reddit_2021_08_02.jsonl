We're currently sitting on a major support level, this is as low as you can get in. It can shoot higher, but 10% is a safe bet here as it retests previous resistance areas.\n\n[current price\\/support level vs resistance. ](https://preview.redd.it/ij2o744vzue71.png?width=1575&format=png&auto=webp&s=d90960e983fd7f61b920f00ddb9f6b085324d1d1)\n\nWalgreens still hasn't fully recovered from Covid crash, and this looks like a clean entry for some easy profits.\n\nNFA.

I'll use some spare time to answer honestly with my own amaturish TA too, since there was no retard talk. Seems fair for your work. I think you might have something, but not totally tits sold.   \nAs you're aware, TA's nothing but just historical data in an attempt to predict the probability of the next move.  \nI don't think WBA has anything to do with covid. Sure, it crashed along with everyone else in March 2020, but it's been on a downtrend since 2015, having lost its WEEKLY 200EMA since 2018. It climbed in back in Nov 2018, lost it again in Dec 2019. Has not reclaimed it since. I use the Weekly instead of the Daily for long term bias.   \nHowever, on the Weekly 200EMA, StockRSI is oversold and curling, with the MACD just recently starting to turn Bullish. Further more, on a candle stick pattern chart, there's maybe a 50% chance that's a Morning Star Pattern. It's less convincing on that since the candle isn't as long. That's why the wife left WBA. If we follow Elliot Wave, we could point the start of Wave 1 on 10/30/20, toping off at 4/09/21, retracing to bottom at 7/23/21, before a long steady grind to hit 55 in about 1-2 months. BEING MINDFUL THAT SEPTEMBER IS USUALLY NASTY FOR STOCKS.  \nAs for the DAILY trend, SRSI looks overbought, but there's still some room to swing up trending on the MACD for bullish movement. Trying to reclaim 200EMA the sell off from 6/30 Earnings. I also try this on the 4 HOUR trend, which should usually mimic the Daily, and it's still looking funky. There was a lot of volume on the last candle compared to the sell off two candles before. SRSI is overbought, and MacD is slightly turning bearish.  \n\n\nIdk papi. Yolo.
