Memory?", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "This is my opinion as an Engineering student but it looks like they are individual chips cut out of a wafer. The reason you can't just use a single wafer with heaps of chips is because there are prone to be imperfections in the silicon themselves and they needed to be checked and binned for yield rates. \nThe reason all the chips are close together is for interconnect efficiency meaning they are clustered together to perform tasks in parallel (like massive video data sets...) the closer they are the faster they can communicate with each other. You are correct with the metal, it is a conductor for efficient heat transfer because these bad boys use a huge amount of energy and need to be efficiently cooled.  I would dare say that the bottom is the motherboard and the mechanism to have them communicate with the rest of the computer.", "score": 15, "replies": []}, {"body": "It's upside down, so the third layer is the chips with a bunch of pin grid arrays. The second layer looks like the processor sockets, each pin grid array (with the gold pins) is a separate chip. The top is either just a case or cooling for the backside.\n\nThe 4th and 5th is cooling blocks, kinda looks like water cooling because there doesn't seem to be any clear heat pipes directly making contact with the processors.\n\nThe 6th layer looks like a interconnect interface which connects to the processors (punches through the cooling blocks), and it probably links the processors together with a high bandwidth link.\n\nBottom layer also just looks like casing.\n\nYou can't really see the PCB though since it's upside down and you can't see the chips themselves so it's hard to see where the memory is, and if it's using HBM.

These look to me like female connectors, pay attention to the notch in the side, which indicates a connector. So they would interface to something below this assembly to get data in/out, remember this thing has insane data throughput so lots of I/O needed. You'll also notice that the 4th layer (the silver metal) is a bit wider than those below, so that leaves room for cabling going down.\n\nThe 3rd from the tip is a 5x5 grid of some type of chip. I'm guessing this is the Dojo chip itself.\n\nThe 4th layer (silver looking metal) is more mounting/mechanical to hold things in place.\n\nThe 5th layer (tan colored metal) also looks to be thermal interface, since it has large metal bars to get the heat out. You'll notice 2 holes in this layer, these are definitely for the tall components on the 6th layer to protrude into (they line up perfectly). One thing that's curious about this layer is the large rectangle sticking up. I'm not sure why there's this tall tan-colored protrusion. My guess at this time is that's used as a standoff, basically to hold whatever is above it in the right vertical height.\n\nThe 6th layer (with the tall components) is definitely the power and miscellaneous circuitry. Those tall components are likely inductors or capacitors for the power supplies, I'm not sure which one. This is where the low voltage (3.3V, 5V, etc) is generated.\n\nThe 7th layer is a heatsink (notice the fins that are pointing downward). This helps to get the heat out of the 6th layer better.\n\nTLDR: This is an assembly of 25 Dojo chips, along with their connectors and power required to have a single \"module\" that can fit inside of a server rack. Imagine thousands of these things in a large network all working together to train the FSD Neural Net. Pretty cool stuff, excited to hear more! \n\nAny more insights please share!
