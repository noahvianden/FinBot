{"title": "Am I screwed?", "selftext": "First of all a small rant, it really bugs me how people here state their opinions without disclosing their positions or their intent. So people will say \"there's a massive crash coming imminently\" and clearly they have a vested interest in that happening because of the plan they are pursuing. But they never say that, they just say there'll be a crash, not that their financial future depends on that happening.\n\nAnyway rant over, now on to my question, am I screwed?\n\nI have 80k of savings in various funds/stocks, investing since around November 2020. Currently the portfolio is up around 5%\n\nIn terms of distribution on the funds, it's probably around 40% USA, 20% China, and 40% rest of the world e.g Europe, Japan, UK. Mostly it's various managed funds and also some passive funds. And it's a mixture of large/small caps, different industries etc. Obviously hard to avoid a lot of overlap with the big American stocks which seem to appear in lots of different funds.\n\nSo here it is. I know nothing about investing, everyone here seems to know everything about fancy graphs and ratios and special magical historical metrics and so on. And now I'm terrified because everyone is constantly talking every day about how Chinese stocks are totally worthless and not even real, and the whole American market is going to crash any day now, and I'm just totally freaking out.\n\nShould I just sell everything now? But then everyone will say, aha but what inflation!? All your money will simply become worthless anyway, and FIAT currency is all made up imaginary money anyway, and the FED and LKAJSDFLKJASD;FLKJAS;DLFKJA;SLDKFJALSKDFJ;L!!¬¬!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LKDJFL;KSJDF;LKAJSDF;LK! :-(", "id": "pdtarw", "created_utc": 1630235087.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 63, "comments": [{"body": "This post is basically the definition of FUD, but internalized.
