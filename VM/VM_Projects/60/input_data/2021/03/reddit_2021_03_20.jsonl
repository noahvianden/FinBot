{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 22nd, 2021", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 22nd, 2021.\n\n# **The Fed could be a source of market volatility as Powell and others speak in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/19/fed-could-be-source-of-volatility-as-powell-speaks-in-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> The Federal Reserve could remain a source of angst for markets in the week ahead, with chairman Jerome Powell scheduled to testify twice before Congress and more than a dozen other Fed speeches expected.\n*****\n> The bond market‚Äôs reaction to the central bank this past week was unusually volatile.\n*****\n> Though the market was initially steady after the two-day Fed meeting and Powell‚Äôs briefing Wednesday, Thursday came with a big selloff in bonds and spiking rates. Traders reacted to the fact that the central bank is willing to let inflation and the economy run hot while the job market recovers.\n*****\n> In the approaching week, bond market professionals will be watching Powell and other member of the Fed for further cues.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThis is bonds‚Äô ‚Äî I wouldn‚Äôt call it day in the sun ‚Äî it‚Äôs more like day in the tornado,‚Äù said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo. ‚ÄúClearly the bond market is the one the equity market is watching right now, and normally that‚Äôs not the case.‚Äù\n*****\n> Stocks were lower on the week, with the Dow off about 0.5% and the S&P 500, down 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite was off 0.8% for the week.\n*****\n> The Russell 2000, however, was hit the hardest, losing close to 3% for the week.\n*****\n> Yields ratcheted higher as the market sold off. Bond yields move inversely to price.\n*****\n> The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, which impacts mortgages and other loans, rose as high as 1.75% Thursday, a move of more than 10 basis points in less than a day. It was at 1.72% Friday afternoon.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe bond move has been huge, and it‚Äôs starting to scare people,‚Äù said Schumacher.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been this question hanging out there for awhile: How much of an increase in yield can some of the higher octane stocks take?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no magic number, but as we speak, the 10-year is up 80 basis points this year. It‚Äôs incredible.‚Äù\n*****\n> # Powell speaks\n*****\n> Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday before Congressional committees along with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Covid relief efforts and the economy.\n*****\n> He also speaks on central bank innovation at a Bank for International Settlements event Monday morning.\n*****\n> Other central bank speakers this week include Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman Randal Quarles, Fed Governor Lael Brainard, and New York Fed President John Williams.\n*****\n> # Inflation and the Fed\n> There is also some key data.\n*****\n> Important releases include the personal consumption and expenditure data on Friday, which includes the PCE deflator, the Fed‚Äôs preferred inflation measure. Core PCE inflation was running at an annual pace of 1.5% in January.\n*****\n> The Federal Reserve this past week took no action at its two-day meeting, but it did present new economic projections including a forecast of 6.5% for gross domestic product this year. The central bank‚Äôs forecast now shows PCE inflation going to 2.4% this year, but falling to 2% next year.\n*****\n> The majority of Fed officials did not see any interest rate hikes through 2023.\n*****\n> Powell reiterated that the Fed sees just a temporary pickup in inflation this year because of the base effects against last year‚Äôs numbers when prices fell.\n*****\n> The central bank will target an average range of inflation around 2%, so that number could exceed that threshold for some time. It‚Äôs a change to the Fed‚Äôs ground rules, which makes the bond market nervous.\n*****\n> Normally, the Fed would hike interest rates if inflation flared up to avoid an overheating economy and avert a bust cycle.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúFor the bond market, and the Fed, there is a communications problem and there‚Äôs a consensus problem. There can‚Äôt not be tension,‚Äù said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThey will be trying to clarify the Fed‚Äôs message, but without a consensus on what those numbers and guardrails mean, it will be hard,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey will be explaining themselves as economists, and they‚Äôll be speaking a different language than the bond market speaks.‚Äù\n*****\n> Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management, expects the bond market could be more volatile than stocks, and inflation would be problematic for both.\n*****\n> At some point, he expects there could be a 10% stock market correction, and inflation or a sharp move in bond yields could be a trigger.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe market is trying to make sense of what could be perceived as a disconnect, between their economic projections and the Fed‚Äôs dual mandate of unemployment and inflation,‚Äù said Grohowski.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúYet, they‚Äôre committed to keep short rates on hold until the end of 2023,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what the market is struggling with. I think it‚Äôs unsettling to me to hear words like ‚Äòovershoot.‚Äô‚Äù\n*****\n> Grohowski expects what he calls the ‚Äògreat rotation‚Äô from tech and growth stocks into cyclicals and value to continue. Growth and tech have been most sensitive to rising rates, and the Nasdaq has corrected more than 10%.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre in the sixth or seventh inning of a nine-inning game. It‚Äôs not over, but I think we‚Äôve seen the lion‚Äôs share of the great rotation out of growth, into value,‚Äù said Grohowski. He said that view depends on the 10-year not rising much above 1.75%.\n*****\n> Grohowski is concerned by the Fed‚Äôs willingness to let inflation overshoot because inflation is a negative for stocks.\n*****\n> Supply chain issues are a concern. He pointed to Nike‚Äôs comments Thursday that its sales were hurt by port congestion, and also the shortage of semiconductors, which is impacting automobile production.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúInflation expectations are troublesome for P/E [price-earnings] ratios,‚Äù Grohowski said. The [stock] market is trading at 22 times our estimate for this year‚Äôs earnings.‚Äù\n*****\n> He said the market is having difficulty reconciling the lack of any forecasted interest rate hikes versus the strength of the Fed‚Äôs economic forecast.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIf you ask me what I lose sleep over? ...It‚Äôs too much of a good thing. Too much of a good thing is being too accommodative,‚Äù Grohowski said.\n*****\n> # Bond market direction\n> Schumacher said there‚Äôs a chance the bond market could steady in the next couple of weeks, even if yields tick up.\n*****\n> He said corporate pension funds appear likely to reallocate capital into bonds before the end of the quarter March 31, and that could be supportive. Also as the Japanese fiscal year is set to begin, there could also be new buying in U.S. Treasurys because on a currency adjusted basis U.S. debt looks very cheap, Schumacher said.\n*****\nHe is also watching Treasury auctions in the coming week.\n*****\nThe Treasury auctions $60 billion 2-year notes Tuesday; $61 billion 5-year notes Wednesday, and $62 billion 7-year notes Thursday.\n*****\nIn particular, Schumacher is watching the 7-year auction, which drew poor demand last month.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/KK3MVBa.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/2awyTVp.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/tMS9TlD.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/Bc06DhO.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/WXJX7nC.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9jNMiei.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/s2AQHPw.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/NmtC2YY.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/ZizMvzO.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/cMfCPvA.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/VVJr800.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Al5OSb6.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Pll3tyz.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # The Bull Market Is About To Turn One\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe stock market is a giant distraction to the business of investing.‚Äù Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard\n*****\n> First off, we hope everyone has a happy and safe Saint Patrick‚Äôs Day! We‚Äôve had a lot of green out there over the past year and here‚Äôs to some more today and over the rest of 2021.\n*****\n> One year ago yesterday was one of the worst days in the history of the stock market, with the Dow losing 12.9%, the fourth worst day ever. In fact, only the ‚Äô29 crash, the ‚Äô87 crash, and the day after trading starting (after being halted for multiple months) in the midst of World War I in December 1915 were worse.\n*****\n> As the great Jack Bogle explained above, sometimes stock market volatility distracts us from our long-term goals. Many investors panicked and sold this time a year ago, only to see stocks soar higher, while bonds struggled and cash didn‚Äôt do anything. One of the most important takeaways from 2020 for long-term investors: it is important to have a plan in place before the skies turn dark.\n*****\n> As this current bull market nears the one-year anniversary of the March 23, 2020 lows, there will be a lot of reflection on how far we‚Äôve come and where we could be going. The bottom line is the economy is recovering at a record pace, stocks are at all-time highs, and we‚Äôll have the NCAA Tournament this year. Those are three things to be very grateful for.\n*****\n> So what happens now is the logical question? ‚ÄúThe good news is previous bull markets have never been lower during the second year of their existence,‚Äù explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúAlthough it won‚Äôt be an easy ride, investors need to remember that history is on the bulls‚Äô side, as this bull market is still just an infant and continued gains are quite likely.‚Äù\n*****\n> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the previous six bull markets since World War II all saw gains during their second year. The average bull market was up 43% one year in and up to 61% two years off the lows. It is worth noting that the current bull market is up close to 75%, making it the strongest start to a new bull market ever, besting the start to the 2009 bull market. But be aware, that bull was up 68% one year off the lows, but up 94% two years off the lows. In other words, strong gains continued (the green line below).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-3.17.21.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Solid Global Growth Outlook but Multi-Speed\n*****\n> Last week we reviewed updated global economic growth forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), highlighting the significant increase in their gross domestic product (GDP) forecast for the United States this year. Clearly the Federal Reserve (Fed) 2021 is reading from the same playbook because they did the same thing yesterday.\n*****\n> Here we look into another set of OECD data points but this time its global leading indicators. As we have noted with the US version from the Conference Board‚Äôs Leading Economic Index, we believe these indicators can provide useful insight into where economies may be headed in the near term.\n*****\n> As you can see in our LPL Chart of the Day, leading indicators in Asia and the United States are pointing to better growth than in Europe. The global growth outlook is no doubt improving, but the recovery is multi-speed.\n*****\n> ‚ÄúGlobal growth should continue to steadily rise as economies reopen and vaccines are deployed, consistent with the message from global leading indicators‚Äù according to LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. ‚ÄúWhen we peel back the onion, we see a stronger picture in the United States and Asia, while Europe is more of a mixed bag. That reflects frustratingly slow vaccine distribution in the Eurozone.‚Äù\n*****\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.18.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\n*****\n> ‚ÄúThe level of these indicators provide a valuable comparison across countries and regions. We also like to look at the momentum of these indicators to identify areas where the picture is getting better. On the chart below, you can see that the strongest momentum is found in Asia, particularly India and China, and the United States. Meanwhile, Japan is holding its own.\n*****\n> On the flip side, the growth outlook in most European economies has stalled, particularly in the United Kingdom. While the paused rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine is part of the problem across Europe, we expect a strong vaccine program in the UK to help turn its economy around soon despite the country‚Äôs below-average LEI level and deteriorating momentum.\n*****\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.18.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\n*****\n> We continue to recommend investors focus their regional allocations on the United States and the Asia-heavy emerging markets. Global LEI data and the pace of vaccine distribution reinforce that positioning, as the global but multi-speed economic recovery from the pandemic continues.\n*****\n> More risk tolerant investors may want to consider a tactical allocation to Japan, where appropriate, given the country‚Äôs relative success containing COVID-19 and bold stimulus efforts.\n\n*****\n\n> # Leading Indicators Remain Stubbornly Tepid\n*****\n> In almost every direction we turn, we see optimism mounting over a mid-2021 economic reacceleration. Unfortunately, it seems we will have to wait at least another month for that optimism to make their way into leading economic indicators in a major way.\n*****\n> On Thursday, March 18, the Conference Board released its February 2021 report detailing the latest reading for its Leading Economic Index (LEI), a composite of ten data series that tend to lead changes in economic activity. Many economic data points are backward looking, but we pay special ettention to the LEI, as it has a forward looking tilt to it. The index grew for the tenth month in a row, up 0.2% month over month in February, a decrease from January‚Äôs 0.5% pace.\n*****\n> While this print still suggests future economic growth ahead, it fell short of expectations that had begun to price in an economic reacceleration on the back of improving vaccination trends. The Conference Board did make special note that factors which may prove to be transient, such as bad weather and related supply chain disruptions, did affect several component indexes. Moreover, it stated that the recently passed $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus plan, a similarly large economic growth factor to vaccine progress, was likely not yet fully priced into the LEI‚Äôs value.\n*****\n> Six of the ten components grew in February, while three declined and one remained flat. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, the ISM New Orders Index, and the interest rate spread led the way among positive contributors. Building permits, average weekly manufacturing hours, and average consumer expectations for business conditions detracted from the composite‚Äôs growth, while manufacturers‚Äô new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft held steady.\n*****\n> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, despite some small head fakes, the monthly change in the index has generally sloped downward since its initial bounce off of the 2020 lows. This signals the index has been increasing at a decreasing rate, as COVID-19 mitigation measures have prevented a full-fledged resurgence. We expect this trendline to turn meaningfully upward once a durable reopening begins to gain traction.\n*****\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Blog-picture-3.19.21.png?ssl=1))**\n*****\n> ‚ÄúIn recent months, financial markets have been agressively pricing in a strong second leg to this economic recovery,‚Äù said LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. ‚ÄúWe are still waiting for much of the economic data to confirm the move, but believe it should not be far off given the extremely promising vaccination trends and large fiscal package that was just recently passed. We think it is a matter of when there is a surge in US GDP growth, and not if there will be a surge.‚Äù\n*****\n> We continue to believe that vaccinations are the key to a sustained recovery and distribution trends have been truly remarkable recently. The most at-risk segment of the population is largely vaccinated already and at this point, more people in the United States have been vaccinated than have contracted the virus. We now have three vaccines approved for emergency use authorization, and President Biden projects that we will have enough vaccine supply for every adult American by late spring. Furthermore, we have increased confirmation that vaccines appear to be effective at preventing transmission as well as symptoms. While growth of variant strains does present a risk, we believe the overwhelming majority of evidence points toward a promising second leg of this economic recovery, which we believe justifies a tilt toward cyclical opportunities over defensive investments in portfolios.\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/Cy92IOW.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/VSgEkbz.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!]())**\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 3.22.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n5EE1ue.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 3.22.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/ZT2EoIo.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  3.23.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/JDpv81w.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.23.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/OSzkmYK.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.24.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VVVrvLD.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.24.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9KQp42F.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.25.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/pBlDIyW.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.25.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/aZ1VNu6.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.26.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/C9OJgI9.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.26.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # GameStop Corp. $200.27\n**GameStop Corp.

The people that are utilizing these new medical services are the early adopters, primary medicine will look a lot different in the future.\n\nSpecifically what's driving the changes:\n\n1. People have access to vast amount of information and are more educated regarding health than anytime in the past.  This allows drug and medical companies to market directly to consumers that understand what their products are for.  The old view of medicine is top down model, younger people are more desirous of a consultant model where the patient is the driver of the medical care, not the doctor.\n2. Diagnostic errors are common in primary care settings leading to delay in diagnosis and often resulting in the need for many followup appointments before correct treatment is initiated.  Many patients with unexplained issues eventually chose to bypass primary care (gatekeepers) due to frustration and seek specialist care in a self-directed manner.  For some issues even AI is more skilled at diagnosis than general physicians.\n3. Chronic disease management is generally performed by data collection and following guidelines and flowcharts.  The standardization of the management of these issues really paves the path for automation as data collection can be done many times at home or other convenient locations (like a 3rd party lab or imaging center).  There is less need for primary general physicians when processes are standardized for common chronic illnesses.  Preventative treatments and testing are also very standardized which could be automated without the need for the educational level of a physician.  We are already moving towards this by employing NP and physician assistants to manage primary care.\n4. Primary health care is unnecessarily expensive as compared to other professional services that people utilize and that have better systems for automating standardized tasks (for example, if I own a company, I can hire a payroll service that specializes only in that service at lower cost than a in house accountant performing the same function).\n5. Primary care is unnecessarily cumbersome as a process due to lack of automation.  Spending time scheduling appointments, going to appointments, having to wait sometimes weeks to even be able to get an appointment, figuring out post-service billing and insurance issues, having gatekeepers block access to services that the patient desires, etc. are all time consuming and could be fixed with different models.\n6. Outcomes are better without physicians for primary care.  \\*\\*\\*This is really the kicker.  In a lot of studies of  the NP model of primary care (with standardization and provider as consultant) shows that outcomes for patients are better for patients who's primary providers are NPs rather than a physicians.\n\nThe AMA has been fighting hard against the changes (ie restricting telemedicine, restricting automation, restricting what other types of providers can do under their licenses, etc).

The AMA has long been the gatekeepers of medical care and the cost associated with this harms patients.  It's simply not true that NP and PAs who provide primary care are more expensive (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4946030/)  Medicare and other insurance companies employ huge actuarial teams and would not be promoting these providers if they did not provide economical care.

For primary care, most of what is encountered is routine and governed by either system wide policies, professional recommendations, best practices guidelines, medicare guidelines, etc.  Physicians practice within this framework as well.  I'm not trying to discount the education and skill of physicians, but unfortunately, for routine care and preventative care, that level is unnecessary.  Our current medical model blocks a lot of people from receiving the care they need, and like it or not, agree with it or not, it's changing because customers want to see it change.   \n\nThe current trends in primary care utilization also don't bode well for the current model.  Younger people increasingly don't have any relationship with a primary care provider, less than past generations when they were at the same ages.

Under incident to billing the care provided by an NP is billed under a physician's NPI when certain conditions are met, including an initial encounter between the physician and patient and the presence of a physician in the office when the service is performed\n\n2) In addition to incident to billing, there are other reasons why services provided to beneficiaries by NPs may not be visible in Medicare administrative data. For example, NPs may not bill all or some of the services they provide under their own NPI number either due to supervision requirements within their organizations, employment arrangements, or state scope of practice requirements for diagnosing and prescribing.\n\n-NP's are not billing for certain procedures or examinations because it is beyond their scope.  They bill these under their supervising physician which cause the weighted average cost to be higher.  Also more complicated and sicker patients that are more complicated are being by their supervising physician instead of NP's.\n\nThe higher bills are happening because NP's are not equipped to handle more difficult cases so all the more expensive bills are billed under physicians which push the weighted average up.\n\nAnd again, many of these data points are nurse practioners that are being supervised, so the cost of these Nurse practioners includes the supervision of Physicians which is unlisted and they are not having independent practice in this study.
