Never sell a call on a stock that can moon.  The short leg will cap your profits at the short strike price.   If you do break this rule (and, well, I do often), sell weeklies.  These are generally cheaper, and less expensive to get back out of.  They also are only good for a week, so you aren't locked in for a long period if you do see conditions change.\n2. You're on the right track with buying a call and selling one to offset the cost.  I would, however, have recommended a different strategy with a two-leg position: a Poor Man's Covered Call.  More on that here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmqbVg9zqjQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmqbVg9zqjQ). But for a PMCC, you'd want to have your long leg at a >= 0.7 delta (deep ITM), and your short leg  <= 0.4.\n3. June may be a bit early for a solid recovery.  The news that we will have vaccines for all within months will certainly accelerate this.  So, you might be right at the edge? Depends on when the whales decide to get off the beach and stop shorting it.\n\nIf I were you, unless you're relying on the premium for that short leg to make the trade affordable, I'd watch the price action on the short leg and buy it back when it's cheaper.  The previous time AMC mooned, in January, it went to $20.36.  If it goes there again, you'll be kicking yourself for that upper leg.\n\nReally, really study the PMCC, and other option strategies on youtube. The creator I've recommended is great.

This is important because the pandemic is \"as good as it gets\" for Doordash--there will never be another time with so many people \"forced\" into ordering delivered food.  Yet with all these factors lining up beyond their wildest dreams, Doordash is still unprofitable.  How unprofitable?\n\n4th quarter 2020: net loss of $2.67 per share.  \nCompared to $3.05 loss per share in Q4 2019.  \nThat's a gain of 12.5%.

The problem is, you need supply to meet demand, which means adding any restaurant to the platform that you can. DoorDash and Uber figured out a neat little trick where you can ultimately put any restaurant on there that you want without permission, but you'll lose money doing it. This move made Grubhub had to do it to keep up with supply/demand, which now is why you see everyone pissed off at all those companies and then trying to get their restaurants removed. The real money is made on merchant run delivery and more and more cities are now implementing laws that make them have to remove their restaurant as a listing without permission. All of that is going to take time though.\n\nSome other issues that are happening besides restaurants having to be delisted are driver rights and fee caps. Those issues will continue to pop up all over, causing more money that is going to be lost. The thing is, Grubhub makes their money off merchant run delivery, so they'd love to get rid of their fleet one day if gig workers have to be treated as employees. Commission caps are causing increased prices which means decreased orders for all companies since they pass those costs to the customers (Doordash/Uber more so than Grubhub).
