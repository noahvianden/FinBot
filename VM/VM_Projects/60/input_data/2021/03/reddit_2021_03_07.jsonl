{"title": "Meme Stock or Future Potential? AMC Entertainment", "selftext": "So like many of us, I've been following this movement with meme stocks very closely wondering if there is money to be made other than just some quick day/swing trades. I've done a ton of research, specifically on AMC because although many expect the \"squeeze\" for GME to be much more likely, the price it's at is very unrealistic and so IF it doesn't happen, then there's not much in terms of future value with a stock already prices that high. Basically it seems much more reliant on a squeeze than anything for your investment. \n\nAMC I'm looking at with a slightly different view.. yes it is a meme stock, yes it is overpriced at the moment, yes they have been bleeding money due to Covid..\n\nBut with all that said, apart from just the \"potential\" for a squeeze, this surge in price they were able to capitalize on and sell shares to raise funds last month to reduce their debt significantly. They also gained an extremely high amount of publicity and sentiment from the public, they have now discussed the option to issue even more shares (which will be kept basically in the war chest by the sounds of it) and I believe they have a very positive plan for them.\n\nThese shares can be used for many things, not just in a negative way by diluting shares to raise capital (which if they went this route, I'm sure they would have BIG plans for that money). Instead I think it may be used for positive things like dividends, a stock split or to protect themselves for after the squeeze and avoid a hostile takeover. \n\nThink about it, the company was in the dirt on the brink of bankruptcy and was/still is being heavily shorted.. why not make the big brain move and reward investors who saved them, and screw over the short sellers who tried to destroy them? Is this not what Tesla did? \n\nOf course, they are losing money, the Earnings report on Wednesday will show this. But that's not at all what I'm thinking about, investors these days aren't just buying things that make sense from a financial perspective. There is reports and facts backing that up.. So I'm actually fairly optimistic that they will release some big news with plans to grow and thrive long term. Is that a bit speculative? Sure, but they would be very smart to do this while everyone is riding the wave. \n\nThey know they need to make change, thus my thinking of the current price actually a fairly reasonable price point. Not because of the current financials, but because of the sentiment behind what is currently happening and basically the value many are seeing just by holding and having faith that the company will improve its business model and come out with progressive growth ideas for the future. \n\nI'm NOT the typical meme stock investor relying on the potential squeeze. I am optimistic about the long term potential here, and think the downside risk is actually not as big as people think (unlike GME at its current price). When I say long term potential, I'm thinking maybe $12-15 over the next year or so? Do I hope it can be higher? Of course, but I think that's on the safe side, while my downside price point is around $6. So I definitely see a higher reward vs risk potential in AMC. \n\nThere are plenty of other DD posts around if you are looking for some numbers to back this thought/theory up. I have read all of them, and have come up with this prediction on my own. \n\nLet me know your thoughts, I'm very open to reasons why this is NOT possible! \n\n\nMy Position: 780 shares @9.3", "id": "m019fn", "created_utc": 1615155922.0, "score": 18, "upvote_ratio": 0.65, "num_comments": 67, "comments": [{"body": "Meme stock.
