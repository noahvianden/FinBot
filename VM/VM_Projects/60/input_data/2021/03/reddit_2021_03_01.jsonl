If Tesla bounces back up to $720 area\n\n$SPI - A global renewable energy company and provider of solar storage and electric vehicle (EV) solutions for business, residential, government, logistics and utility customers and investors, announced on 2/18 that Phoenix Motorcars, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company's EdisonFuture subsidiary, delivered the first of two electric service trucks to the City of Woodland, California. The trucks are the first all-electric medium-duty commercial service tucks of their kind to be built and used in the industry. Funding for the vehicles and infrastructure was coordinated between Phoenix Motorcars and the City of Woodland, leveraging local Air Quality Management District (AQMD) and utility funding programs. The fact that SPI is now a major solar player AND is providing EV medium duty TRUCKS, is HUGE! With the new stimulus being passed, there is sure to be even more investing in these two areas. SPI just crossed the ultimate moving average and looks ready to pump as soon as the market bounces back.\n\n$NKLA - According to reports, Nikola still has some cash in the bank right now, but at the rate it’s going burning through it with lawsuits and investigations, drastic action will be necessary soon.\n\nSympathy/Related: #PLTR #IDEX #SOLO #AYRO #BLNK #SBE #KDNI #FRSX #IDEX #NIO #MDGS #APPL\n\nMARIJUANA:\n\nVirginia joins 15 other states in legalizing marijuana\n\nThe Virginia Legislature approved adult-use marijuana legalization today in a historic vote marking the first state in the Old South to embrace full legalization ALL STOCKS BACK IN PLAY\n\n$NBY – NovaBay Shares Spike To Session High On Volume As Co.'s Avenova Unit Tweets '...Avenova will now be available at selected CVS pharmacies...\n\nSympathy/Related: #CRBP #ACB #TLRY #OGI #HEXO #CRON #IGC #SNDL #HUGE #APHA #YCBD #NBEV #NTEC #KERN #MBII\n\nBTC/BLOCKCHAIN:\n\nBITCOIN under 50K\n\n$IPDN - The company recently cut about 50% of IAW (International Association of Women), a business unit of the Company. They also are focusing more on online customer acquisition as opposed to telemarketing methods, which will cut costs and shifts the company toward a future long-term strategy of growth with a highly efficient team. The company stock sold off from recent highs and is trading back around support levels, with the \"Daytrade Killer\" chart in full effect.

MoneyLion offers a suite of millennial-friendly personal-finance apps which Wall Street is currently hot on. Any personal finance apps aimed at millennials and Gen Z, such as SoFi, is bound to get a lot of attention from Wall Street.

Oprhan status includes protocol assistance, reduced regulatory fees, research grant funding, and 10 years of market exclusivity following approval. Earlier this month, the company teamed up with India's Bharat Biotech to co-develop a novel COVID-19 vaccine candidate for the US market. OCGN was running on Friday, followed by a small selloff in after hours simply because of Friday afternoon profit taking. Expecting this week to be another great week for the company as it is now trading over the ultimate moving average. The small drop down after hours might be coming back to retest the ultimate moving average as support, followed by more gains.\n\n$AIKI – Swing Alert – closed to bottom from Friday sell off.

It is also a victim of our down market. Coupled with the short report that was released cause this stock to be beaten down. Huge upside for this one as we can expect to see a reversal in trend.\n\n$FUBO - ER 3/2 the market has been red these past days, the stock experienced some selling off in the oversold territory. The anticipation for earnings we should expect to see a bounce.\n\n$AMC - ER 3/4 AMC Entertainment\n\nTECHNICALS:\n\n$ONTX - this stock is a social media favorite, their [r/s](https://www.reddit.com/r/s/) cancellation is taking place on March 4th, this all with their pipeline, the amount of insider buys and largest holding for social media traders. The volume will come and fall the above makes this a catalyst stock.\n\n$BOXL - history repeats itself and this had a great run in March 2020. On the company’s twitter page we can expect news to be released. On Friday we alerted that $BOXL was discounted for its upcoming news. Expect the announcement on Tuesday, many are speculating a government contract as it pertains to the New Relief Funds and with recent stimulus news. More reward than risk here.\n\n$STON - Upcoming ER should be very promising with Covid. This company owns and operates cemeteries and funeral homes. The company sells cemetery related merchandise. The company operates approximately 320 cemeteries in over 27 states and Puerto Rico, and approx. 88 funeral homes. With COVID numbers where they were this winter, I'm expecting this company's earnings report to be very good. Also, the Daytrade Killer indicator is flashing green with a wave trend green dot down at support levels with \"vix fix\" touching resistance levels. (See Charter 1 Youtube Channel, Video 2: \"Daytrade KIller\" for a better understanding)\n\n$EH –this will be the leader in Urban Air Mobility moving people and goods autonomously. If the entire market at any point to green then base on the 4hr chart we are going to jump and hit resistance at the $60.43. Support at $38.65\n\nBack Burners: \\^LOTZ $AMC \\^PRPO \\^NERV \\^NURO \\^EQ \\^BIMI \\^XTNT \\^LIXT \\^OCGN \\^FSR \\^INTZ \\^RUBI \\^GME", "id": "luza70", "created_utc": 1614570777.0, "score": 286, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 67, "comments": [{"body": "Looks like I have a lot of sympathy.
