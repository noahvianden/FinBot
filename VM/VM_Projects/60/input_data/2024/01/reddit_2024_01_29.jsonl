Basically‚Ä¶\n1. Less volume. We know this. Less volume is less revenue. Part of this is amazons cut back of using UPS as a carrier. Part is less retail growth which means less online shopping. \n2. Employee raise. The union already costs the corporation so much quarterly, and their day to day operating costs are already super tight and strained. A union agreement to raise wages took effect and this will raise costs higher. \n3. Cancelled the building Of a proposed distribution centre.
