Keep an eye on the 1 day (each candle is 1 day) RSI for stocks you are trading, if they get to 80 it may be a good time to take profit. As far as AAPL there are reports that last quarter was fairly good. Overall for the market it is beneficial that earnings are good to show an economy that is resilient and strong. This puts the Fed in a place to make a \"good\" rate cut because GDP is in a good place along with jobs  and inflation that is trending lower. What you do not want is the Fed to make a \"bad\" rate cut because of a slowing economy and increased unemployment. Typically rate cuts signal that there is a recession. But for a soft landing you want strong GDP jobs under 5% and lower inflation. However, as far as tech goes, you have two of the most bullish weeks of the year in the beginning of July. August is your last chance for a rally because after earning season, Sept Oct  usually are brutal on the market. So plan to take some profit and hold cash for bargain shopping in Sept/Oct. By the end of Oct the market usually rallies the most into the week of Thanksgiving. Early December you see some selling for tax harvesting. Then there is a Santa Clause rally at the end of the year. Then beginning of the year is typically bullish. For Sept/Oct the Russell 2000 (RUT) might pop.

{"title": "Berkshire Hathaway dumps $2.3 billion worth of Bank of America shares  ", "selftext": "Berkshire Hathaway dumped more Bank of America shares this week, making it six straight trading days that Warren Buffett’s conglomerate has reduced its stake in the bank.\n\nThe Omaha, Nebraska-based holding company sold another 18.9 million shares via transactions on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at an average price of $42.46, raising $802.5 million, a new regulatory filing showed.\n\nOver the last six trading sessions, Berkshire has unloaded 52.8 million Bank of America shares worth $2.3 billion, reducing the stake to 12.5%. Berkshire still owns 980.1 million Bank of America shares with a market value of $41.3 billion, a distant second to its $172.5 billion holding in Apple.\n\nBerkshire is required to disclose its stock moves within two business days after they are made, when the stake in any company exceeds 10%.\n\nBuffett could be trimming the bet on valuation concerns after Charlotte-based Bank of America outperformed the broader market this year. The bank stock is up more than 25% in 2024, compared to almost 14% for the S&P 500.\n\nIt marked the first time since the fourth quarter of 2019 that Berkshire cut its Bank of America stake. In 2011, the Oracle of Omaha bought $5 billion worth of the bank’s preferred stock and warrants to shore up confidence in the lender as it grappled with losses related to subprime mortgages in the aftermath of the financial crisis.\n\nJust last year, Buffett spoke highly of the leadership at Bank of America, even as he offloaded other financial names. In 2022, Berkshire exited a handful of longtime bank positions, including JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp. \n\n“I invited myself in, many years earlier, and they made a very decent deal for us. And I like Brian Moynihan enormously, and I just don’t want to, I don’t want to sell it,” Buffett said in 2023 of holding Bank of America.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/25/berkshire-dumps-2point3-billion-of-bank-of-america-in-a-6-day-sale-.html", "id": "1ebwo2i", "created_utc": 1721918692.0, "score": 720, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 72, "comments": [{"body": "Dumped isn’t really the right word when you’re taking a profit on the transaction.", "score": 258, "replies": [{"body": "An it’s only like 5-6% of the total shares they own.", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "“I dumped my girlfriend.
