{"title": "The media came up with new bullshit: the great rotation.", "selftext": "I've been seeing the idea of a great rotation floating around -- there's a major shift happening. “The funds have started to sell off big-cap stocks and instead buy small-cap.” But is this just more bullshit designed to drive clicks?\n\nThe idea originated when SPY had an unusually bad day at the same time that the Russell 2000 -- an index tracking small-cap stocks -- surged 10% in a week. However, such large jumps are normal for the Russell 2000 index since it tracks volatile small-cap stocks. So this doesn't really justify the great rotation.\n\nHowever, the great rotation idea does seem to capture an interesting sentiment that SPY is overvalued relative to the rest of the market. And with major stocks like TSLA, NVDA, and GOOG all having a terrible week, some people have started to wonder if we are entering a bear market. \n\nWhat if the Magnificent 7 are simply overvalued and we are starting to see some correction now that the earnings are not living up to expectations? Look at their PE ratios: Goog - 24, META - 26, AAPL - 34, MSFT - 36, AMZN - 51, TSLA - 62, NVDA - 66. These companies are priced for incredible growth, yet all of these are mature companies, and some of the largest corporations on the planet. There is not much room for further growth to justify these prices. Google is already hitting the limit of the number of humans on earth. And there doesn't even seem to be enough electricity to power all the GPUs that the market seems to expect NVDA to produce. \n\nIf these giants cannot live up to their growth stories, the price will correct. I don't think it's some sort of major macroeconomic trend–it's more a micro individual company trend. And since the Magnificent 7 makes up 30% of SPY by weight, bad news in one of these companies will drag down the entire market.\n\nGiven how inflation has been coming down and the Fed has been talking about a rate cut, the party will go on–just maybe not for Magnificent 7, since it's easier for them to disappoint than to live up to the incredible expectation everyone seems to have of them.", "id": "1ecdxle", "created_utc": 1721963681.0, "score": 76, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 71, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 4 | **First Seen In WSB** | 9 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 2 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 9 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "They're pushing this new narrative only to get right back into tech at lower lows.

They may buy put options and sell stocks to drive prices down, creating uncertainty and potentially benefiting from the decline.
