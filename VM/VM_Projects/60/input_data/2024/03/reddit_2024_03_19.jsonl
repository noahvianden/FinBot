{"title": "NVDA 🚀: So, what’s going on with NVDA!", "selftext": "Don’t take me wrong. I’m one of Jensen’s biggest fans including his jacket🧥! \n\nWhat I’m saying is that entire investor world has been waiting for GTC for weeks. In his keynote, Jensen could have included some easy to understand things or “dumb it down a bit” for investors, analysts & media! WWDC is Apple’s Developer conference but they always consider this factor. \n\nPer WSJ, the new chips that NVDA announced today may cost $50,000, about twice as expensive as analysts have previously estimated! And, they’re already booked! Nvidia is just getting started folks.\n\nI think, things will become more clear during Jensen’s interview tomorrow morning on CNBC. There is a lot more to come in this WTC. According to WSJ, the tech luminaries speaking at the conference include executives from OpenAI, Elon Musk’s xAI, Meta Platforms, Google and Microsoft. A broader slice of corporate users of Nvidia’s AI chips—L’Oréal  , Lowe’s, Jaguar Land Rover, Shell, Verizon Communications  —are also sending representatives. I won’t be surprised if there are some announcements from partners like SMCI, HP and Dell etc.\n\nI may be wrong, but as I see, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. So, I’m going to hold on to my 3500 NVDA shares for a very long time. Luckily, I got into NVDA at very good time!
