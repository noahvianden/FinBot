Tesla could have done that with drivers. Don't really need FSD. And you're right, it's silly. Although if you big enough you could just go compete with them and buy them off just to kill them. But then I want to be nice and would not do that.\n\nNow for the robotaxi, Tesla could take out the main operation cost by removing the drivers. It can either take more profit and compete with the others. Or pass the cost saving to its customers. I want to be nice. So I might pick the latter. The byproduct would be killing the Taxi and Uber. They would have two choices: join or die (or third: find a niche).  \n  \nFor the new car sale disruption, you could try imagine that the robotaxi will be so cheap and so convenient that you leave your car in your garage because you didn't buy FSD outright (and you didn't feel silly wasting the purchase). What is the point of owning a car if it would just park in the garage? It even has the potential to be more economical than public transport for shorter commute. Maybe ... the 20mil-cars-a-year Tesla's 2030 target may just be all we ever need in the market. What that would mean to the other car manufacturers? I guess that might be facing the same fate as the taxi and Uber.  \n  \nAnd how far do I have to think? As mentioned above, you can guess as well as the amount of information you have. Based on what the information, late this year or as late as early next year we would have something in the US. Last year, based on one of the financial call before they release the V12, they implied they figured out FSD. After the release, it's evidence that the cars exhibit intelligence never seen before. Elon said earlier this year, the only thing that slow them down as compute. The last month he said it's no longer the problem. 12.3.x rolling out really quickly. Then announcement of the 8/8 on X last week.\n\nFor the affordable car, in the book and some interview, Franz came out to say that he and others in Tesla convince Elon to go with both drivable car and the robotaxi on the same platform, just in case the FSD didn't happen or took too long.

And there would have to be taxis ready for morning commutes 100 times the amount needed on average, meaning 90% of Tesla's robotaxis would be without rides 90% of the time.\n\n>Maybe ... the 20mil-cars-a-year Tesla's 2030 target may just be all we ever need in the market. What that would mean to the other car manufacturers?\n\nMusk practically abandoned that goal, which is what the buzz is all about. Instead of Tesla making cars for people, it wants Chinese and European manufacturers to make cars while Tesla develops robotaxi software and puts it in its own cars, which are not produced in large quantities.
