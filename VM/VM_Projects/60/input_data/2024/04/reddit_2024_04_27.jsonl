I can’t tell you anything definitively about whether this would work, but I’d be happy to chat more about this.\n\nWhat I’ve noticed (and it sounds like you’ve noticed too) is, the total price of an ATM long straddle (call and put, together) often goes up before it goes down.  Not always, but usually.  Which suggests selling at some percentage gain (like your 30%), and some percentage loss.\n\nMy particular interest is really cheap straddles despite a DTE of, say, two or three weeks (so there is time for the stock to move before much theta decay).  For example, I saw a price of $0.40 a straddle last week on a $33 stock, expiring mid-May, and I thought, wait, people are betting this stock won’t move by even fifty cents over multiple WEEKS?  I found the stock by looking for stocks hitting an IV low, because the absolute worst thing that can happen when you’re holding a straddle is for the IV to drop.  What you want, ideally, is a likely IV rise.  The stock is Hashicorp, and the reason for the low IV is the announcement of IBM planning to buy them for $35 a share.  Still, there are all sorts of reasons the stock could move a little bit, so I bought a bunch of contracts.  Sure enough, within 24 hours, there was a point in time where the straddle was up 20%.  I’m holding out for a little higher.  I’m excited to see what will happen today.\n\nThe great thing about a straddle, with the DTE I am talking about, is you aren’t going to suddenly lose it all.  There’s only so much it can go down, because of the time value.  The worst case, as I said, is IV drops, the straddle loses (say) up to half its value overnight, the stock refuses to budge over the coming days, and then the value decays.  You still have time to sell it without losing ALL your money, at least, if you don’t hold it until expiry in any scenario.\n\nAlso, if something unexpected happens and everything moves, you make money.  I like a bet where if anything unexpected happens, you win.\n\nI hadn’t thought of using a stock that has a really high IV, where the options are “expensive” rather than cheap.  But maybe there’s a logic there about the IV being unlikely to go down?  With a really short DTE, I would worry about needing to understand the fine details of theta decay, and being in situations where I need the stock to move NOW in order to make money, but it just isn’t moving much in an afternoon, which is pretty normal for a stock.

Molten salt is perfectly fine being at the required operating temperature. These facts all differ from the other SMRs.\n\nOklo's biggest hurdle will be regulatory. The NRC has a long precedent in reviewing light water pressurized reactors such as those brought forth by NuScale, but not so much time reviewing molten salt reactors for approval.
