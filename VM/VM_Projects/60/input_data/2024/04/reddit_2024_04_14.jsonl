Ukraine will become a member of NATO.  Our purpose of the summit is to help build a bridge to that membership and to create a clear pathway for Ukraine moving forward.  We‚Äôve done a lot of work on that over the last couple of days here in Brussels, a lot more work to be done between now and the summit, but we will see, I think, at the summit very strong support for Ukraine going forward and its relationship with NATO. \n\nBut we‚Äôre equally focused, as I said, on the immediate and on Ukraine‚Äôs needs today, tomorrow, the day after to help it withstand this ongoing aggression from Russia.  We‚Äôll talk about all of that and the work that our two countries continue to do together.\n\nThe final point is this:  The fight that Ukraine has on its hands is not only Ukraine‚Äôs fight; it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs fight.  Because the aggression being committed by Russia is not only an aggression against Ukraine and its people, it‚Äôs an aggression against the very principles that lie at the heart of the international system.  If Russia were somehow to succeed in Ukraine, if we did not continue to stand with Ukraine, the message to would-be aggressors everywhere is it‚Äôs open season; you can get away with it too. \n\nAnd so it‚Äôs imperative that Congress move forward with a supplemental budget request that President Biden made for additional assistance to Ukraine.  It‚Äôs not only in Ukraine‚Äôs interest; it‚Äôs profoundly in our own.  And we have dozens of allies as well who feel the same way, who are more than picking up their share of the burden.  And the supplemental will help ensure that we can continue to deliver for Ukraine because Ukraine is delivering for us, fighting the fight every day to uphold these principles that Russia‚Äôs aggressing and that matter to the United States and matter to every country in NATO.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "True‚Ä¶", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Bitcoin is down because of the Halving on Tuesday.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "To be fair, it broke 61k and is choppily moving back up.
