While deep out-of-the-money S&P 500 options seem viable, they are prohibitively expensive for my small account. Alternatively, I'm considering purchasing a deep in-the-money LEAP VIX option, despite its large spreads.

VIX isn't an adequate hedge, since it doesn't always move oppositely or as much as your correlated (beta 1.0) equities.\n\nYou discovered the main drawback of hedging -- insuring against loss has a high up-front cost. So you'll have to compromise somewhere. Since you mentioned a small account, you might consider compromising on the amount the hedge would cover. Say you have $5000 and it costs too much to hedge all $5000 in a total loss scenario. So, instead, consider hedging $2500 or even just $1000. This makes sense if you think about how your home or car insurance premiums work. The cheaper policies don't cover full replacement cost, right? There's a cap on the losses they will cover. It's the same principle for managing your budget for option hedging. \n\nYou can do this by buying fewer protective puts, or puts that are more OTM and thus cheaper. Going the OTM route means that small losses won't be covered at all (kind of like a deductible on an insurance policy), but once the value of your portolio gets to the strike level of the put, your loss slows down as the put starts gaining, and once it is 1.0 delta, all losses are canceled out.\n\nAnother theory is don't hedge a small account at all, if you are early in your wealth building life cycle. A total loss of your entire account could be a drop in the bucket, considered against an entire lifetime of wealth building. Say your lifetime networth will be $2 million. Losing $5000 in the first year or two of that investing lifetime is not worth worrying about.

That would also be true if the price of the shares were halved after hours. Or any other price movement. Do you think they do something different if the stock price only went up $.69 vs. doubling?

{"title": "$COIN is about to skyrocket and no one is talking about it", "selftext": "Coinbase ($COIN) is poised for significant growth, supported by favorable market conditions and strong financial performance. The value of Coinbase is closely tied to the performance of cryptocurrencies. In Q1 2024, Coinbase reported a 72% year-over-year increase in revenue, reaching $1.6 billion, with a net income of $1.2 billion. As the primary custodian for Bitcoin and Ethereum spot ETFs, Coinbase benefits significantly from institutional investments, enhancing its profitability.\n\nThe approval of Ethereum spot ETFs by the SEC marks a pivotal development. Historically, the approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs led to a 112% increase in Coinbase‚Äôs stock price within three months, driven by heightened trading volumes and new user sign-ups. A similar, if not greater, impact is anticipated with the Ethereum ETFs, potentially driving even higher trading volumes and revenue growth.\n\nImho, two main factors influence COIN prices: the performance of the crypto market, which is currently bullish, and institutional news. While ETF approvals are largely priced in, the ongoing COIN vs. SEC lawsuit is not. Since bitcoin and Ethereum are not security (due to etf approval), chances that Coinbase will win the lawsuit increased (they already filed an appeal to close the case after Ethereum etf approval). We will probably see some news coming from that area in next weeks, leading to upside price action. Additionally, the full impact of the ETH ETF, including increased commissions and ETH staking rewards, has yet to be realized, which could further boost Coinbase's earnings. The next FOMC meeting is expected to be dovish, potentially lifting tech stocks if rate cut announcements occur, further benefiting Coinbase.\n\nAnalysts remain bullish on Coinbase, with several setting price targets above $300, reflecting confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on these trends. As institutional adoption of crypto assets continues to rise, Coinbase is strategically positioned to benefit, and retail investors have yet to fully participate.\n\nWhat's your toughts?", "id": "1d33ost", "created_utc": 1716956773.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.47, "num_comments": 68, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 6 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Poor people will always be poor.", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "*Chad*", "score": 8, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Greetings/Hey/Sup fellow WSBers, \"this stock is undervalued\" & \"no one is\" talking about it/seems to notice/is paying attention.\n\nThe fundamentals r good / FOMO / Bullish \n\nBoop beep.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "**VM attempted to say something likely TOS-breaking, violent, or reportable.**", "score": 7, "replies": []}, {"body": "Still not another nividia pump thread", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Fair enough.
