Mercedes is actually the first manufacturer to release cars in the US with Level 3 capabilities (self-driving in very limited conditions, in California and Nevada only)\n\n• There has been no recovery in LiDAR stocks (which i would expect if we were on the cusp of greater\nautonomous taxi adoption). Before you say, “but Tesla\ndoesn’t use LiDAR” it still means there are policy and regulatory hurdles that every robotaxi type service needs to overcome.\n\n• The Federal government currently limits the number of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in the US at 2,500. That’s currently it. No more. The NHTSA proposed increasing this cap and intended to proceed with “AV STEP” rulemaking last fall but\nmissed its deadline; I can guess as to why.

You can be more capable in autonomous driving from a tech standpoint than a Level 4 system while still not having the regulations done to be called anything other than Level 2.

Tesla has solved that for the last 8 years. It's great that Mercedes is doing the L3 portion, but it is no where as capable as Tesla's AP, much less FSD.\n\nIn tests between Waymo and Tesla's FSD, FSD almost always gets to the same destination faster than Waymo, normally because Waymo is more limited on where it can go.
