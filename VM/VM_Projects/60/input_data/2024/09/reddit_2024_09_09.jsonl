First of all, they license all of their software to these companies, so you're just flat wrong that they are not part and parcel of these breakthroughs. But also they have several partners and direct investments into this space. [See here](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/self-driving-cars/partners/). \n\nNot that I'm confident autonomous driving will be solved anytime soon, but maybe.

First, don't lie about working at Nvidia when you clearly don't know much about the company or what it's doing. Second, stop gathering your data from idiotic news outlets and instead investigate the company yourself, or at least read in depth analysis, like SemiAnalysis. Third, stop being so fucking hubristic and overconfident in your views. Your comments amount to hand waving, and yet you think you have a highly detailed thesis, where you're buying puts that will almost assuredly never be ITM and are probably just going to lose you money, however small. \n\nIs AI a bubble? Maybe, but I don't think the evidence suggests that at all, and you haven't even remotely made a compelling case. In fact, you haven't even made a case at all. You just keep *asserting* it.
