When it comes to options, most of the money is actually made by buying and selling the contracts themselves rather than ‚Äúexercising‚Äù them (which would mean you are actually buying the 100 shares). When I say buying and selling the contracts, the way that works is that you pay a ‚Äúpremium‚Äù per share of the option (each option is 100 shares) so let‚Äôs say I pay $7.50 per share on that option, that means the call option is worth $750 total when I buy it. Let‚Äôs say that at the time I buy the contract, NVDA is at $110 and it rises to $150. That means the intrinsic value of the contract goes up by $40 per share, meaning that the contract is at least now worth $47.50 per share, up from your initial $7.50 investment.

{"title": "Intel (INTC) Bear thesis for Earnings", "selftext": "Intel has had a rough month.  If you browse the r/pcmasterrace you will see numerous threads about how Intel's most recent line of chips frequently throw errors and cause numerous problems in applications.  This issue has also received decent attention in the press and it effects their entire line of most recent chips, including the commercial sector and server consumers; this issue is not limited to retail consumers.  Intel's response to these reports has been a bit schizo; first denying the problem exists, then claiming they found the issue and had a fix lined up, then announcing there was no possible fix and most recently denying that there would be a recall despite the faults in their product.  This behavior has had a negative impact on consumer sentiment for the company.\n\n  \nRecently in the news Intel has announced mass layoffs, there is even a recent thread about his in WSB; this is not a good look as a company enters earnings.  If Earnings were good we wouldn't expect an announcement of mass layoffs, it is another bearish indicator as Intel enters earnings after market closes today.\n\n  \nLooking a little deeper into the most recent earnings report and comparing them with google's stock graph over the year, you can see that with the last two earnings reports INTC dropped immediately following earnings.  The last earnings report drop is the most interesting to me since even though Intel reported a slight beat in earnings, the stock dropped over 10% the next day.  I believe the earnings report coming tonight will be very bad for Intel and we will see a similar drop in stock price to what occurred the previous 2 earnings as past behavior is the best indicator of future behavior.\n\n  \nCounterthesis:  I'm not overly confident in this play.  INTC has dropped around 4% over the last week.  It's possible that investors have already \"priced in\" the expected bad numbers into the upcoming earnings; if so while the earnings report will definitely be bad regardless, they may beat the expected terrible earnings with mere bad numbers and the stock may stay flat or even rise slightly; this is especially true since investors are aware of mass layoffs which will reduce expected costs for the upcoming quarter.\n\n  \nTaken as a whole I expect a drop following Intels reported earnings and have bought puts on INTC expiring 2Aug 2024 as a result:\n\n  \nPositions:\n\nINTC 30p 2Aug24 x10\n\nINTC 29p 2Aug24 x30\n\n", "id": "1ehij4j", "created_utc": 1722523660.0, "score": 80, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 62, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 2 | **First Seen In WSB** | 8 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 77 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ehij4j/intel_intc_bear_thesis_for_earnings/) \n**Account Age** | 10 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You rich now?", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It will probably miss earnings‚Ä¶ the danger is that they have a positive forward outlook and it jumps anyway.
