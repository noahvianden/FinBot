I donâ€™t think you can call that a second act. I donâ€™t want to get too off track here but the point I was trying to make about MSFT is that companies that dominate the S&P 500 from decade to decade donâ€™t repeat as new technology is introduced.

IBM dominated in the 1950â€™s and 1960â€™s with their mainframe computers but got out of favor when mini computers were introduced by companies like Wang and Digital. In the mid 1980â€™s they got a second life with the advent of the PC . Although IBM is a terrific company, the stock hasnâ€™t performed very well since the turn of the century. Maybe Watson will get them in gear if they can compete in AI. Apple was a good stock in the 1980â€™s, then got trounced by corporate adoption of Windows PCs in the workforce.

Xbox hardware revenue decreased by 42% and they aren't sharing any GamePass financials so I doubt it's as successful as they would've liked. Without the Activision purchase, LinkedIn was bringing in more revenue at higher profit margins than their entire gaming division.\n\nMicrosoft is by far my biggest holding, and I genuinely would not care at all if they just shut down the entire gaming segment tomorrow.

Something Nvidia is doing, and Google tried with Stadia. \n\nAnd please, don't mention Nintendo and Switch, it is not part of the conversation as it's not a contender for either of those consoles, there is no overlap, nobody is choosing between Switch and PS5. You are either a Nintendo fan, or not. If anything I think we should bring Steam to the table, they are the silent killer, imo. \n\nAnd as a major MSFT holder myself, I would say that I don't think Xbox is doing well, and I do believe they'll need to innovate a lot with their next iteration, but I am also liking the shift, and looking forward to what's coming.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Xbox console business is close to getting shut down.
