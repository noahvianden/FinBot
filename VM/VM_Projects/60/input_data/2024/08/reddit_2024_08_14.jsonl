{"title": "The Perfect Storm: Be cautious before going fully back into bull mode", "selftext": "Disclaimer: I am not yet lifetime profitable.\n\nThesis: I think this short term bounce might potentially very quickly run headfirst into a wall and come crashing down hard. Maybe even already today.\n\nWe are fast approaching the 50 SMA as well as a more notable resistance. Additionally at almost the same spot we are running into a short term downwards sloping trendline as well as a longterm upwards sloping trendline (the purple X). Also, volume has been extremely extremely extremely light since Friday. Add to this that today CPI is coming out and that for a while now this pullback has been extremely volatile, in both directions, and usually such huge moves in such a short time dont last very long and always beget a quick counter reaction. All these things are also happening near the symbolic 5500 level.\n\nI think the market is just looking for an excuse to go lower and will price in CPI negatively more likely than not. \n\nNow we may very well just continue to go higher, but even then I do not think there is much breathing room to the upside left. in 2023 there was a similar, less volatile pullback that lasted from 1st August to 1st November, while also having bounces inbetween, but always resulting in a lower high. There were similar pullbacks during earlier years.\n\nThe sentiment I gather from the various stock subreddits seems very bullish, but considering the above and the fact that we cannot be sure until we have actually surpassed the previous ATH, I would be very cautious to go back into bull mode. I, for one, am looking for a short opportunity here, either when its already going down hard or when we approach the 5500 level.
