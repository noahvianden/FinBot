I've linked the Delaware Chancery Court's opinion, below, and encourage everyone to read it regardless of your vote. I'd also encourage you to not vote based on an emotional reaction, as doing so can result in poor investment outcomes. \n\n\nBecause not everyone has rime to read a 208 page opinion, I'll extract when main points (witch page cites so you can verify my statements). \n\n\nThe overarching issue is twofold: (1) there is a number between 0 and 56 billion wlthat would have motivated Musk to stay at Tesla and the Board simply failed to negotiate this on our behalf and (2) the board claimed that the compensation targets were exceedingly difficult to meet while they sat on projections showing that all performance goals would almost certainly be met. Prior to the vote, the performance metrics needed for each traunch of compensation was lowered and the vote was forstalled until the \"steepest part of TSLA's s-curve growth was imminent. Pages 82-86.\n\nAdditionally, Musk said numerous times (and testified under oath) that he intended to stay at TSLA for the rest of his life (regardless of whether it was CEO). The board nevertheless approved his $56B pay package to motivate him to do what he said he already would (something his muti-billion dollar stake in TSLA would have already provided for).\n\n In other words, the compensation plan was designed and timed intentionally to ensure that all targets would be met. The Court discusses this on page 7 of its opinion indicating that: \"Musk . . . Recalibrate the speed and direction {of the compensation plan} as he saw fit. The process arrived at an unfair price.\"\n\nLink to the opinion (I don't know how to directly link a .pdf so if some kind redditor could help, it would be much appreciated!). In the end, it seems based on current data that the compensation package will pass.

I'll take your other comments as the authentic oppinion of the Judge.\n\nMy issue with this is that it makes it seem like this level of profitability was guaranteed, and that Elon's negotiations on the compensation package were pernicious. Of course, he will renegotiate to what he thinks is possible if his execution is up to the task. It was massively uncertain if the company would survive the Model 3 ramp in 2018 and was entirely a \"bet the company\" moment.\n\nThere is another world where a CEO like any of the other EV companies was in Elon's position, and Tesla languished in its scaling efforts. Tesla went bankrupt like many of the other EV startups are about to now, and he never achieved the level of success we're seeing now. I say pay the man.

I'd still encourage you to read it (but also understand that it is not exactly light reading).\n\n\nThere is obviously no way to guarantee profitability - I absolutely agree. I also agree that Musk has helped Tesla, especially in the early years of coming on board. \n\nI don't take any position on whether Musk's negotation on the package was harmful because, as the opinion discusses, there *were no negotiations.* The board accept every single one of Musk's asks with no push back and even revised his targets to make it easier to hit them.\n\n\nWhat I have a greatwr issue with, however, is that they board did not devise and call a vote on the compensation until their own projections repeatedly showed he would get the full $56B by hitting all targets. If that is the case, they should have pitched the compensation as \"he will probably get all targets but we think he is worth 56B,\" as opposed to \"these targets are almost impossible to meet so he might get nothing.\" This, to me, is misleading.\n\n\nIt is based on this deception that I feel compelled to vote no. However, if the board goes back and says, \"we'll we took a look at our projections and want to pay Musk this amount even if we are almost certain all targets will be met,\" I'd be much more open to it.

The 10% EBITDA/revenue ratio modeled by Ahuja, therefore, was comparatively low and thus easier to achieve. Tesla ultimately based the Grant‚Äôs EBITDA milestones on an 8% EBITDA/revenue margin, making them even easier to achieve.*\n\n\n\nTwo paragraphs down from your quote, the court found that the BOD knew that, based on its current projections, Musk would meet all EBITA mile stones yet did not disclose it to the shareholders, instead opting to characterize then as \"stretch goals and challenging hurdles\" when they were already projected to be met by mutiple studies:\n\n\n*Tesla prepared three sets of projections during the process. During July 2017, Tesla updated its internal three-year financial projections (‚ÄúJuly 2017 Projections‚Äù). The July 2017 Projections reflected that the S-curve‚Äôs exponential growth phase was imminent. Tesla shared the July 2017 Projections, which the Audit Committee approved, with S&P and Moody‚Äôs in connection with a debt offering. The 2017 Projections showed revenue growth of $69.6B and adjusted EBITDA growth of $14.4B in 2020. Under the July 2017 Projections, Tesla would achieve three of the revenue milestones and all of the adjusted EBITDA milestones in 2020. The Proxy did not disclose this.*\n\nThis was, in part, why the package was struck down. You've perfectly highlighted my point with your quote in that the board told shareholders one thing (these are very difficult!) without disclosing studies showing that the targets would be met imminently based on the company's current trajectory or disclosing that they had adjusted the EBITA targets downward to be equivalent to some of the lowest avaible benchmarks.\n\nHere is the full text of the opinion:\n\nhttps://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2024/02/01/tesla-musk-case-post-trial-opinion/", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "I know you wrote this for people, but the problem is sentiment manipulating bots.
