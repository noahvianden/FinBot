And Tesla did recently confirm that they've replaced all of their own Semis with Tesla Semis. So, besides Tesla/DHL/and maybe one or two other companies receiving some deliveries it seems most of the trucks they've built have been for internal use.\n\nAlso unknown is how these are being assembled in the current factory. Safe to assume though that the purpose built factory will be much more automated and efficient. If Tesla's other product ramps are any indication i would assume their aim is to be at a run-rate of 25k/year about 12months after they start production in the new factory which i think Tesla have guided for Q4 2025/Q1 2026.
