AAPL closed exactly at 235.00 on Friday, and today I got the alert from Vanguard that the option was exercised and my shares were called away.

To save themselves the trouble of collecting and processing millions of exercise notices, they have a policy of just going ahead and exercising all long options that are in that situation.
