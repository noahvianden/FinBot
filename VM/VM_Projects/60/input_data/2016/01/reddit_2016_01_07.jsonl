You're going to go through the same process as every rookie options trader:\n\n1. You'll start by buying super cheap way OTM calls or puts hoping for a big move and big pay day. This won't happen and you'll lose every time. Often you'll buy options too close to expiration, like weeklies and lose the entire premium. On the off chance one of those plays is in the money, you may wait too long to exit and the time premium will cause you to lose money even though the stock moved in your favor.\n\n2. After a while of doing this, hopefully you've done some reading and figured out that most OTM options expire worthless, so you start buying ATM and ITM options, they're expensive but a much greater probability of expiring in the money. You start making some money on a few trades, but you're still trying to pick the direction of the stock and you lose more than you win. You're not losing as much as before, but still losing.\n\n3. You've done some more research and reading, and found that buying a call or put spread is a better option as you can sell the higher strike to cover some of the costs of the lower strike. More of your trades are making you money, but you still have no exit strategy and you're trying to pick direction. Overall you're breaking even or losing on commissions.\n\n4. At this point, you've read more about options and found out that 90% of options expire worthless and that the traders making money are the ones selling options, not buying. So you start to read up about option selling, specifically selling spreads. You start to sell credit spreads on individual stocks and find that you're making money a lot more of the time, but when you lose you're losing more than you take in credit.\n\n5. You find out about delta neutral trading where you don't care which direction the stock will move, and you use the volatility of the stock to calculate a probability of a given move. You use this probability % and credit collected to start trading iron condors and butterflies. You're profiting on 8/10 of your trades because you're selling theta and as long as the stock isn't making any wild moves you're doing ok. But occasionally the stock gaps up or down on news and you lose more.\n\n6. The final step, and I really wish I'd known this years ago before I learnt to trade options the hard (and expensive way) is to trade delta neutral strategies on indices like SPX. You have the liquidity, the broad market exposure (instead of single stock risk), lower commissions, and the tax advantage of 60%/40% long term/short term split. The margins are better, and as long as you've done your homework, you should be able to make a decent weekly income.\n\nNow I'm not saying any of the other strategies don't work, they just haven't worked for me. I've talked to people who do well just buying weekly calls and puts on liquid stocks like AAPL, FB, NFLX and GOOGL. I guess I just evolved as an options trader moving to more and more profitable strategies.\n\nSo for you, with $1000 you can start by selling call or put spreads on SPY, or even maybe a weekly iron condor on SPY starting with 1 contract. Just make sure your commission isn't eating up the credit you're collecting. Find a broker like Interactive Brokers or Options House that have low options commissions. Then make sure to collect at least $200 in premium for a condor.\n\nAlso, I recommend you read a broad scope options book like Options as a Strategic Investment before doing any actual trading.\n\nI'm happy to answer any questions you have, and good luck!
