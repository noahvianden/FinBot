EU and Norway are already cutting subsidies for greener cars.\n\n\nOther manufacturers have the capacity to produce electric cars before Model 3 hits the market. Their cars are ugly as shit, but that can change within the next 2 years. All it takes is to make an electric version of one of their top 5 seller cars.\n\n\nTesla is now one of the most valuable car companies in the world with a small fraction of the sales other players have.

Also, I do think the stock is way overpriced and I have a trailing stop-loss on my shares with the intent of shorting after they sell.
