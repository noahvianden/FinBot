Where are the OEMs going to land with AMD?\n\nYou are very likely dead wrong, it is far more than just hype. We already saw Apple use Radeon in their latest computers, Apple loves custom designs, and with Zen, AMD can offer custom designed APUs that will fit their design purposes better than building around an Intel solution.\n\n\nDell has traditionally used Intel exclusively, but part of that was due to a deal, that Intel had to pay a heavy fine for. So there is good reason to believe that if AMD has actual competitive parts, Intel will not be able to keep AMD out of the market so easily again. First because Intels prior practices have been ruled illegal, and next because AMD now know what they may have to go up against.\n\n\nWith Zen APUs AMD will likely have by far the strongest integrated offer, but that will not be until 2nd half of the year.\n\n\nJanuary is merely the basic desktop CPU, but the real cake is when the server chips and Zen APU arrive.\n\n\nIf Zen is just close to i7, that's good enough for AMD to become a lot more profitable with APUs later. If it is strongly competitive, they will become profitable in the server market too, and may even dominate on servers in China through the China deal they made earlier this year. On top of that, AMD seems to have found a way to leverage Vega for servers too, and if that's the case, Intel may have a lot of catching up to do.\n\n\nApart from integration AMD has also done a lot of work on stacking, and they've developed HBM/HBM2 which now seems mature enough to finally become more widespread. The standard is open, so Intel can use it too, but that is still good, because AMD will be on at least equal footing on the best high performance RAM technology.\n\n\nAPUs with Zen/Vega/HBM2 are already being developed, and expected 2nd half of 2017.\n\n\nSo although Intel may continue to dominate sales, due to market inertia, there is veery good reason to believe that AMD will gain marketshare and profitability. We've already seen AMD improve on discrete GPUs with Polaris, although Nvidia still dominates, AMD has significantly increased sales compared to last year.\n\n\n>They like seeing the stability of i5/i7 on their workhorse desktops.\n\n\nA lot of people are dismayed by the lack of performance improvements of i7 since it launched. Performance has only improved marginally between iterations, IPC and clock combined has only barely double total performance in 7 years, and that's including 3 new process technologies. Intel has still been able to keep prices high due to lack of competition.\n\n\nSo I think the market very much wants to encourage more competition to Intel, both OEMs and consumers. But of course there will also be customers that will hang on to the Intel is best mantra, which has been true for about a decade now, and can be pretty hard for some to get used to not being quite as true as it used to be.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Dell is all aboard the Kaby Lake train for the FY18 product refresh.
