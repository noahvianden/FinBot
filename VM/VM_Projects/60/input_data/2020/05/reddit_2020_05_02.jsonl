I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning May 4th, 2020.\n\n# **April’s jobs report showing millions out of work looms large in the week ahead  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/aprils-jobs-report-showing-millions-out-of-work-looms-large-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> Investors will focus on the slow reopening of the economy in the coming week, as Friday’s dismal April employment report is expect to paint a frightening picture of the most rapid job losses in history.\n*****\n> The unemployment rate is expected to jump from 4.4% to over 16.1% in April, the highest level since 1939, according to Dow Jones. Job losses are estimated to total 22 million, slightly below the entire number of jobs that were recovered since the Great Recession.\n*****\n> Strategists said the market will likely be able to look past the terrible jobs number as it has done with most bad data, showing the results of a sudden and unprecedented shutdown of the economy.\n*****\n> “I think people are too gloomy about the unemployment situation. I think they think the unemployment rate is going to rise through the summer,” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont. “I think the unemployment rate probably peaks in May.”\n*****\n> Earnings season continues with dozens more companies reporting first-quarter results and talking about the impact of the virus and shutdowns on their businesses. So far, earnings appear to be down 12.7% in the first quarter, based on actual reports and estimates, according to Refinitiv. A diverse group of companies report, including Walt Disney, General Motors, CVS Health and Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n*****\n> But investors are watching the restarting of the economy, now underway at some level in many states. “If they go well that’s a good thing, but if in a week or two, you start to see some bad virus numbers, that’ll be a blow to confidence,” said Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo.\n*****\n> # Best April in years\nStocks started May with a sharp decline Friday, after a 12.7% gain in the S&P 500 in April, its best month since 1987.\n*****\n> Sam Stovall, CFRA chief investment strategist, said the market had been looking forward to the latest extension of fiscal stimulus, approved by Congress, and comments from the Fed, which reaffirmed after its meeting Wednesday that it will do whatever is needed to help the economy. “Now there’s not that much to look forward to,” he said, adding the market would react negatively to any resurgence in the coronavirus outbreak.\n*****\n> “We had a very nice April, the best April since 1938. May is sort of a ho-hum month,” said Stovall. “It’s in the bottom half in terms of average price change, slightly below average in terms of frequency of an advance. … Just looking at last year, May tends to digest April’s gains.” The S&P 500′s April gain was its best for the month in 82 years.\n*****\n> # Virus economy\nEconomists and market strategists have been tracking the progress of the virus state by state, watching hospitalization rates, new cases and recoveries for clues on how quickly the economy might be able to restart. The economy is expected to have plunged into a deep recession in the second quarter, contracting by 35% or more, after a 4.8% decline in the first quarter.\n*****\n> Stanley said he expects the unemployment rate to be a better-than-consensus 11.6% in April before it rises again in May. “This is all a stab in the dark,” he said.\n*****\n> “I think it’s not going to come down as quickly as it went up,” said Stanley. “But I do think you’re going to see steady improvement. I think you’re going to see millions of people brought back into the payrolls for several months in succession. I think we can get out of the double digits [unemployment] by the end of the summer.”\n*****\n> Some workers are expected to return to their company payrolls as a result of the small business-focused Paycheck Protection Program, which encourages companies to keep workers on their payroll and bring back those who were cut. But that may not show up until May or June as a factor in the jobs data, Stanley said.\n*****\n> Millions more are expected to have filed for unemployment claims in the week ending May 2, on top of the 30 million who filed in the previous six weeks. Economists say with such big unprecedented numbers, it is difficult to predict the unemployment rate since some people may have been temporarily unemployed and expect to return to work.\n*****\n> But regardless, the number could be a shocker even though the market has shrugged off the big numbers of jobless claims and focused instead on the virus curve flattening.\n*****\n> “I think it could spook people,” said Schumacher. “In the markets, we’ve been watching the weekly claims, but everybody knows what unemployment is.”\n*****\n> Stanley said he is also watching Tuesday’s ISM nonmanufacturing data, a look at the services sector during April. A cross section of March data shows it was the services sector that took the biggest hit in the shutdowns, and it’s unclear how quickly it can recover.\n*****\n> “There are people who will go and do things as soon as they’re allowed to, and there are people who are going to stay home for a month or two longer,” he said. “I do think expecting we’re going to pack 100,000 people into a football stadium in September is way too optimistic.”\n*****\n> Stanley said some of the steep drop in consumer spending in March was the result of consumers stopping spending on health care, including elective surgery. That actually is an area that can bounce back quickly once the health care system is up and running for non virus related treatments.\n*****\n> # A new 20-year bond\nThe Treasury could announce its new 20-year bond on Wednesday, when it discloses its quarterly refunding requirements, Schumacher said. He expects about $21 billion of the new 20-year to be issued in the second quarter.\n*****\n> The amount of Treasury debt is expected to grow in the second quarter to help fund the growing deficit, made bigger by the trillions the government is spending to combat the virus.\n*****\n> “The supply announcement we think is significant because you’re going to see large auction increases, not just for one month but set in motion for many months to come,” said Schumacher. He expects Treasury to announce $330 billion in notes and bonds in the refunding for the second quarter, up from $240 billion in the first quarter.\n*****\n> Treasury bill issuance is expected at $1.9 trillion in the second quarter but Schumacher expects that to fall to $260 billion in the third quarter. The bills were used to give the Treasury cash to pay for emergency programs and more of that debt will move to long term debt.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/lucZqhO.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/ScMf5ki.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/lTrieA0.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/a6RSgrj.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/9mfZglW.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Rkt7Uup.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/8Ru9JJy.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/1L1YEEG.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/DwM4sys.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/OxcbRYQ.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/zvZWYtm.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/93bme56.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/b57XIzN.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# US Manufacturing Sector Has Entered a Deep Recession\n\n> It is a foregone conclusion that the US economy has entered recession, led by the consumer, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the US economy based on gross domestic product (GDP). The collapse of consumer spending was evident in March personal consumption expenditures data released on Wednesday that showed a record 7.5% month-over-month drop in consumer outlays. It would have been worse if we weren’t stocking our refrigerators and pantries.\n\n> The manufacturing sector is also contracting sharply, not surprisingly given the business shutdowns that began in March. Investors had a glimpse of the extent of the hit to manufacturing in the business investment component of first quarter GDP, which revealed a sharp 8.6% annualized decline, durable goods orders for March, which fell 14.4%, and Markit’s preliminary Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for manufacturing in April that came in at 36.9, a level consistent with a severe recession.\n\n> Today’s Institute for Supply Management (ISM) PMI for manufacturing—the so-called official PMI—provided more evidence of the depth of the manufacturing downturn. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the headline index fell 7.6 points to 41.5, better than Bloomberg’s consensus forecast of 36, but a level consistent with prior recessions.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ISM-Chart.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> But that’s the good news. Peeling back the onion in this report reveals that the headline number was inflated by the supplier deliveries component. Normally, lengthening supplier delivery times reflect strong demand, which prevents suppliers from keeping up. However, in this environment, it reflects supply chain disruptions from lockdowns around the world related to COVID-19.\n\n> The new orders and employment components of the report, which both fell more than 15 points to around 27, are better indicators of where manufacturing activity in the US is right now. The new orders number just missed the December 2008 level of 25.9, while the employment component hit its lowest level since 1949, putting the slump into proper perspective.\n\n> “The more forward-looking components of the ISM report clearly indicate the manufacturing sector is in the midst of one of the sharpest contractions ever,” said LPL Financial Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. “Given the close relationship between manufacturing activity and corporate profits, the 25% cut to S&P 500 earnings estimates for 2020 that we’ve seen since March 1 is probably not enough.”\n\n> The ISM report points to a sharp upcoming drop in capital investment and a huge hit to earnings in the second quarter—potentially down 40% year over year (FactSet consensus is calling for a 38% year-over-year decline in S&P 500 earnings).\n\n> Looking ahead, while the economic impact of the global lockdowns has been severe, we continue to be reassured by developing plans to reopen the economy, progress toward treatments and vaccines, and the resolve of Americans to get through this. We continue to expect a very strong rebound in manufacturing and the broad economy later this year.\n\n*****\n\n# Global Central Banks All In\n\n> The Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) all met in the last week and while the show of power was minimal compared to recent weeks, they collectively reasserted their resolve to do whatever is necessary to support the global economy through the COVID-19 economic crisis. Rates are being held about as low as they can go, significant new programs to enhance market liquidity and support lending are in place, and, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, asset purchases have accelerated. In fact, with April not yet completed, central bank assets have risen over $3 trillion, the biggest two-month jump on record.\n\n> “The central bank response to COVID-19 has been fast, effective, and built to impress,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “And the market is seeing it. It’s no coincidence that the market bottomed the day after the Fed rolled out a wide range of new programs addressing key areas of market and economic disruption.”\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Blog-Chart-20-04-30.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> Overview of Recent Central Bank Activity\n\n> The Fed concluded its most recent two-day meeting on Wednesday, April 29. Prior to the meeting the Fed had expanded its program supporting municipalities by lowering the minimum size of the city or county to qualify. The Fed left its target rate unchanged at 0 – 0.25%. Through its policy statement and Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s comments, the Fed signaled that it is unlikely to remove its extraordinary policy support anytime soon, and we believe the Fed may hold its policy rate near zero into 2022. Asset purchases are currently open-ended and have expanded to include investment-grade and high-yield corporate exchange-traded funds.\n\n> The BOJ met on Monday, April 27 and announced that it would lift its cap on buying government bonds, making purchases open ended, and triple the size of its corporate bond commercial debt purchases.\n\n> The ECB met on Thursday, April 30 and announced new refinancing operations and that it would ease conditions on long-term loans to banks, encouraging banks to increase lending.\n\n> With interest rates near zero, all major central banks have been expanding their economic support through new programs and increased asset purchases. Central bank are showing that in a time of crisis, their policy response is not limited to setting policy rates or even bond purchases. The expanded activity has all but eliminated the idea that the central banks are out of ammunition, both now and looking forward. There will come a time when these programs will end, balance sheets will unwind, and rates will rise. But until that time, central banks have shown that even prudent support in a time of economic distress is only limited by their imagination, keeping the old investing maxim “Don’t fight the Fed” alive even in an age of zero rates.\n\n*****\n\n# Typical May Trading: A Month of Transition with Negative Predisposition\n\n> Once again it is that time of the year where we increasingly see and hear “Sell in May.” But when exactly in May is the “best” time to sell? Based upon the last 21 years of data, the best time could be early in May. The month has opened well, on average, recently with strength on the first trading day and on the second trading day for the most part. Afterwards, DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all tend to drift sideways to lower until around May’s sixteenth trading day or so. It is on this day the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 begin to rally to finish the month. Beware though, this late-May rally typically fizzles before it can exceed the highs reached earlier in the month.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/1df0a9e6bf9c57baf44e6917725a0b23/49574a3950141284-4d/s500x750/4f224d3ee89c6ef6d69c08facbac61a77da3fd3b.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# This is Still an Election Year\n\n> We have all been rather preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, market volatility and our individual situation. Meanwhile there is still a U.S. Presidential Election taking place this year. And folks are beginning to wonder what the next political alignment might be and the ramifications that alignment has had on the market historically.\n\n> Six possible political alignments exist in Washington: Republican President with a Republican congress, Democratic congress or split Congress; and a Democratic President with a Democratic Congress, Republican Congress or split Congress. Data presented in the chart below begin in 1949 with the first full presidential term following WWII.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dce5f19dd2ccfc16a4e0795dd5a11f68/8033867962439c40-45/s500x750/8543ffd66d568035ffa681a3d72b861c8f84b996.jpg))**\n\n> Election years are traditionally up years. Incumbent administrations shamelessly attempt to massage the economy so voters will keep them in power. But sometimes overpowering events occur and the market crumbles, usually resulting in a change of political control.\n\n> Republicans won in 1920 (DJIA -32.9%) as the post-war economy contracted and President Wilson ailed. The Democrats came back during the 1932 (-23.1%) Depression when the Dow hit its lowest level of the 20th century. A world at war and the fall of France jolted the market in 1940 (-12.7%), but Roosevelt won an unprecedented third term. Cold War confrontations and Truman’s historic upset of Dewey held markets down through the end of 1948 (-2.1%). Recently the Great Recession and bear market of 2008 (-33.8%) helped put Obama and the Democrats back in the White House.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/fe57b47990e4b1b913e16595818a4df4/8033867962439c40-ea/s500x750/b5004568a1ca04f9004d23bd405de22f277408f2.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n# 10-Day Advance/Decline Lines Running Hot\n\n> The gains in the first half of the week lifted every sector but two—Utilities and Financials—above their 50-DMAs. Meanwhile, Health Care had even touched overbought territory (over 1 standard deviation above its 50-day) earlier in the week, making it the first sector to be overbought since late February.\n\n> When it comes to another measure we monitor, the 10-day advance/decline line, conditions are more broadly appearing overbought. The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average number of daily advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last 10 trading days. Very high readings suggest that things have gotten extended in the very near term and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low reading suggest the opposite.\n\n> The 10-day A/D lines for sectors have been pretty strong recently indicating broad participation in the rally, but this has led these readings to become elevated indicating conditions may be running a bit too hot in the near term. Outside of the defensive sectors like Consumer Staples, Utilities, and Real Estate, every sector's 10-day A/D line has been in overbought territory at some point over the past week. The same can also be said for the 10-day A/D line for the S&P 500. We'd note, though, that while A/D lines are extended, they're not at extreme levels seen at other points over the past year.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/05/10day.png))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$SHOP** \n> * **$ROKU** \n> * **$DIS** \n> * **$TSN** \n> * **$CVS** \n> * **$BYND** \n> * **$PYPL** \n> * **$SQ** \n> * **$ATVI** \n> * **$W** \n> * **$UBER** \n> * **$SRC** \n> * **$PINS** \n> * **$MRNA** \n> * **$REGN** \n> * **$L** \n> * **$JBLU** \n> * **$GOLD** \n> * **$ENPH** \n> * **$SWKS** \n> * **$SPCE** \n> * **$RACE** \n> * **$TTD** \n> * **$WAB** \n> * **$GM** \n> * **$PTON** \n> * **$ALK** \n> * **$ZNGA** \n> * **$TEVA** \n> * **$SYY** \n> * **$OXY** \n> * **$WYNN** \n> * **$NEM** \n> * **$PLUG** \n> * **$TWLO** \n> * **$TREE** \n> * **$LYFT** \n> * **$TMUS** \n> * **$WING** \n> * **$INSG** \n> * **$CHGG**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/DwM4sys.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/fFKeAlB.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/gSYI5N4.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 5.4.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/prLXepG.png))\n\n\n> # ***Monday 5.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/jw2RTuJ.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7mAza6O.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 5.5.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/mscKzT0.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/Tky4XEa.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 5.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/gdB37XQ.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xGfgbcX.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/bpE2fWG.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 5.6.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/W6XbJBI.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/JZwMlr5.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 5.6.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/Vhn1mi6.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/hp7xyEA.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/UHwESXC.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/4oIA9f4.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 5.7.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ndodqdm.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/q3GjlwY.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/CH3tis0.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 5.7.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/6NNcgwo.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/39e93bE.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/Qxeu7FU.png))\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/PPwVvFj.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 5.8.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/vmioO0H.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 5.8.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ohuyRuS.png))\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n# Shopify Inc. $613.64\n> **Shopify Inc.

{"title": "DD- GLD, Stagflation, and You", "selftext": "Hey nerds, Duncan here. You might remember me from [last week's DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g8od1g/cacc_subprime_autoloans_are_totally_gonna_go_tits/), in which I argued that a company whose entire business model consists of exploiting the poor is worthy of your totally un-earned NEET bux. In today's not financial advice we are going to talk about the currency without a state, the oldest medium of trade, Scrooge McDuck's drug of choice...I'm talking about gold.\n\nNow, there is a reason that commercial advertisements for gold target demographics that we will generously call \"unsophisticated\". Gold is perfect for short term thinkers/investors because doesn't actually grow in the long term the way equities or bonds do. But to understand the powerful short term play I'm talking about, we need to understand the role gold actually plays in the international monetary system.\n\nAfter WW2, the Allied powers got together and realized that they needed a way to avoid the hyperinflation of 1930's Germany which had led to the war. In order to ensure currency stability the entire world agreed to peg their currencies to USD. And USD would be backed by gold. If one of the currencies was too much in demand, threatening the carefully managed exchange rates, than the IMF would step in and pump or dump the currency until it returned to the right exchange rate.\n\nThat system worked great until around 1971, when Nixon lost tons of the government's tendies napalming rice paddies. The US government paid for the war with debt, and by 1971, Nixon was afraid of actually getting margin called. So he, with no notice to anyone, announced that the US dollar was no longer backed by gold. Suddenly it was a free for all. The US economy was hit with both high unemployment and high inflation, other currencies floated all over the place. Basically, it was the chaos we have today.\n\nSo Duncan, you might ask, does anyone buy gold today? Well, almost every central bank in the world continues to hold gold, and lots of it. The reason they do so is the same reason almost all historic currencies were based on gold: that because gold can't easily be printed, it can't be easily be manipulated, and it can't easily be degraded or destroyed. In fact, it's perks strongly parallel those of Bitcoin. In the event of a crisis, a country can liquidate its gold reserves for more currency. This is especially helpful when a reserve currency, or the native currency is in trouble. For example, we see Venezuela, whose own currency is totally worthless, USD reserves are useless due to sactions, and therefore it has turned to its gold reserves to pay for imports of food and medicine.\n\nGold's reputation as a systemic-risk hedge is so great, that in times of market instability or crisis, it actually assumes a negative beta. That is, it moves opposite equities. However because it is an almost fixed quantity asset, it also changes value against other currencies. So, when we have our friend Jerome running his printer like crazy, increasing the [money supply at an unprecedented rate](https://imgur.com/a/dT62Gbh), he should be increasing the price of gold, or rather, making the USD/Gold exchange rate higher. In fact, we see that around late 2018 the trump tax cut began to pump more liquidity into an already hot economy, [starting a USD/Gold price increase](https://goldprice.org/gold-price-history.html). Likewise, as the world economies look more and more risky, and the world's reserve currency's M2 expands faster than Boogie2988 after a breakup; we should see central banks continue to purchase gold as a hedge against continued economic instability.\n\nThe Fed has made it clear, that it will do everything possible to avoid deflation. However, after 10 years of historically low interest rates and at times QE, consumers simply have not seen wages or prices increase significantly. So where has that steadily increasing money supply gone? Well, the answer appears to be that some assets are experiencing inflation: Financial instruments, urban housing, medical care, and college tuition--anything that can be funded through cheap debt--have taken the brunt of inflation. Meanwhile the average American consumer can't even find 4 hundred dollar bills to rub together in an emergency. So we can be almost certain that the Fed will keep printing, in the misguided belief that its freshly minted money will eventually trickle down to the American consumer, but in the process the Fed will raise the price of stocks, bonds, houses, colleges, medicine, and most importantly gold.\n\nAs we have discussed, gold is good for two things: hedging inflation, and reducing systematic risk. And right now, both of those traits are looking very, very valuable.\n\nEdit: Since every post I get accused of pump and dump, I will disclose my current related positions: UGLD, and about 1-1.5 oz of physical gold. I include an option recommendation for the algos, but honestly, if you don't know how to gain exposure to gold, this post probably won't help you. \n\n8/1 180c GLD", "id": "gcdjeo", "created_utc": 1588452099.0, "score": 85, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 67, "comments": [{"body": "You're too bearish, I got 6/30 200c", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "How confident are you that those will print?", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "Down 50% so far", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "So a sort of \"WSB confidence\"", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "We’re all about the story behind the tendies", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "I got leap calls on GOLD back when it was near it's bottom.

Gold is comparatively quite expensive to store, purchase, and transport.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-01/gold-is-losing-its-luster-for-the-world-s-central-banks](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-01/gold-is-losing-its-luster-for-the-world-s-central-banks)\n\nIf you want a hedge against inflation, buy TIPS. If you want to hedge against systemic risk, buy CDS.\n\nDon't buy gold unless you understand its biggest market, consumer jewelry use. Mostly in India and China.

Sure, there were frequent outbreaks and epidemics, but they were NOTHING compared to what happened to the native Americans after smallpox was introduced when they had no immunity at all which was a Black Death level event.\n\nSecond, the flu IS subject to herd immunity.  While the flu changes over time, it doesn't instantly render your antibodies useless.  Instead, as the virus diverges, they provide less and less protection over time but still provide resistance to similar viruses.   For example, did you know that survivors of the 1918 flu pandemic were found to be resistant to the 2008 H1N1 flu pandemic?  Flu vaccines, while the desirable way to prevent the flu, actually result in fewer antibodies and weaker immunity than actually having the flu.\n\nHerd immunity is a mathematical function. What you have to keep in mind is that herd immunity isn't an on/off function, it's a sliding scale.   Let's say New York had 20% of its population infected in this coronavirus wave.  That means that 1 in 5 transmissions that would happen in the next wave won't happen.  Let's say the natural R0 of coronavirus is 6.  After the first wave, it's only 4.8.  Another 20% get infected in a second wave.  That brings your R0 down to only 3.6.  So on and so on, until we hit 83% total immune when R0 is reduced to 1 and it becomes literally impossible for the number of cases of the virus to rise.\n\nI highly doubt there is the political will to do what I suggest, but if you deliberately infect people highly likely to survive at a controlled rate, I believe the overall death toll and economic impact can be decreased.", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "You must both be making different points, because you are ackmowledging here that herd immunity won't stop outbreaks.

Bozos got summoned and Muskeroni lost his noodle on a perfect legit, and i’m sure, insightful and creative tryptamine inspired elf love festival.\n\nThe oracle from comaha had some bad things to say about airlines, well duh, and we’re going to have a bad year, well duh. But what investors are going to realize is that stocks are going to go up and if they should buy now before the next guy does\n\nTldr; if you bought stocks at any time before during or after the great financial crisis of 2008 you would have made awesome returns.

As such its affecting everyone except apparently some island nations. So who the fuck is the US’s competition? Bar flu central? Doubtful. EU, too comfy in their social net (can confirm its WAY better to live here than the US, but its not risk inspiring)\nWho else? Africastan? South banana republic? \nThere’s no one. Foreign investors are going to dump into US equities ESPECIALLY as their economies falter\n\nDisclaimer i’m selling puts and buying calls", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Great to have a contrarian view, thank you for your posts! I do feel that we have not hit a point where the infections in the US are providing a heard immunity. This is, of course, speculative, because testing in the US is not pervasive enough to give anyone an accurate picture, one way or the other.\n\nAs to who our competition is? This is not a zero-sum game. The economy works through connections - whether within the US or to other countries abroad. Our supply chains and trade are set up globally, and we don't win if others are losing and vice versa. Emerging markets are seeing declines in investment, yes, but when the futures earnings potential of US countries is declining due to the corona virus or other economic conditions, it drags everything down. Whether the Fed and Congress ruin that with reckless monetary policy and spiral us into uncontrolled inflation is irrelevant; further inflows of foreign investment to our markets does not mean the asset prices will expand further or even remain at their current levels. \n\nOne note: too many puns?

But stock prices are driven by people trying to get as much out of their money as possibøe. When the connections breakdown, they breakdown for both sides, and when resulting earnings are bad they’re bad for both sides. \nWreckless monetary policy, commited by many sides (not all). So tje question is where will people decide to park their money? US, for alot of reasons. Its got alot of problems and its society is totally fucked but its still an economic and military powerhouse\n\nAnd my puns are great, some people say they’re the greatest", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "I mean, even if you are right and by some miracle US continues to outperform, then the massive investor flight to US equities due to these very expectations will bring down the per share return to the global average, so it is possible that your notion turns out to be self-defeating.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}
