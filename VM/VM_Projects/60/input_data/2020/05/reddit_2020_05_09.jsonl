There are so many conflicting articles saying oil is recovering whereas some say the oil crash is far from over. I really dont know what to believe.

Storage was a contributor, but not the primary cause of the negative prices.\n\nWhen the price goes negative and stays negative, you can rightly attribute that to having run out of storage. In the meantime, these massive spikes are speculators making very bad calls, timing the market poorly, and paying the price for it. These speculators largely learned their lesson last month, those that didn't are probably bankrupt. Those that took a haircut, won't be so keen to burn more money this month. Which is exactly why USO bailed out of the June contracts as soon as it could (unsurprisingly crashing the price). USO is not the only holder of those contracts, anyone paying attention would have been taking similar steps.\n\nWhere does that leave oil? Contango should persist, which is good for tankers. Just less likely to see a repeat of the super contango situation as speculators get less risk averse, and spread their bets over longer dated contracts.
