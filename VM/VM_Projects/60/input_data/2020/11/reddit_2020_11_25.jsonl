{"title": "You should be careful about “Recovery Stocks”", "selftext": "I see a lot of posts about investing in airlines, hotels, and all this stuff. It’s not a bad idea, to be clear. Obviously as the pandemic winds down people will resume old travel habits for the most part. But just because the industry will recover doesn’t mean the companies will. A lot of people seem to be taking that for granted.\n\nThe US (and most of the world) entered the peak (not the beginning) of the financial crisis in September, 2008. By January, I’m sure plenty of people had the awesome idea to invest in some recovery picks. 5 months after that, in June 2009, GM filed for bankruptcy protection. That’s a 9 month lag time. The peak of the COVID outbreak was March and April, so a similar 9 month timeline runs through January. We aren’t there yet.\n\nRemember 9/11? That was in 2001. Everyone knew air travel would eventually recover. It wasn’t at all crazy to invest in recovery plays after a year or so. But not everyone recovered, as Delta Airlines filed for bankruptcy 4 years later, in September of 2005.\n\n“Are You Ready for the Technological Revolution?” is an omniscient article that was written in February of 2015. Tech had already taken off and the sectors dominance was inevitable. RadioShack (a tech specialty store) missed the memo, they filed for bankruptcy that exact same month. \n\nThe point of all this, **and the tl;dr**, is that it’s not as simple as recovery = profits. No matter how amazingly the travel industry rebounds in 2021, it’s a certainty that there will be casualties and money will be lost. Please, choose carefully. \n\nLinks:\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_financial_crisis_in_September_2008#Developing_global_financial_crisis\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Chapter_11_reorganization\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Delta_Air_Lines#Bankruptcy\n\nhttps://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/02/are-you-ready-for-the-technological-revolution/\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/081315/5-reasons-why-radioshack-went-out-business.asp", "id": "k0xtry", "created_utc": 1606329173.0, "score": 69, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 56, "comments": [{"body": "Well since the pandemic started i have seen countless posts advising against investing in airlines cruise lines etc etc, But still i jumped in and i’m 40% up on all airline stocks.

{"title": "APXT: Merging with AvePoint", "selftext": "APXT has reached a deal to merge with AvePoint, the largest Microsoft 365 Data Management Solutions Provider. The company is being valued at $2 billion and will trade under AVPT.\n\nAPXT has a huge client base already, at an estimated 7 million members. 25% of the Fortune 500 uses Avepoint.\n\n'AvePoint’s 7 million customers represent a 3% share of Microsoft’s 250 million 365 users. AvePoint believes it can get to 10% share and Microsoft will hit 500 million users in the future, good for 50 million AvePoint future customers.'\n\nAddressable market: $33 billion by 2022.\n\nThe company ALREADY HAS REVENUE (unlike other SPACs), which is expected to total $148 million by the end of this year. A large % of this is recurring revenue as well, with 78% of revenues in 2020 estimated to be recurring. Expected revenue CAGR of 30% to 2022.\n\n**5-time winner of Microsoft Partner of the Year award.**\n\nManagement: 'Apex is led by former Oracle CFO Jeff Epstein and former Goldman Sachs Head of Technology Investment Banking Brad Koenig'. These are huge, knowledgeable players. They can turn this company into a goliath, especially with the extra capital from a SPAC.\n\nBig name backers: Sixth Street Partners, Goldman Sachs,\n\nBig advisors on the deal, including Goldman Sachs, Evercore and Citigroup.\n\nThis seems similar to the other data related plays weve had this year \\*cough\\* PLTR \\*cough\\*. Not the same type, but definitely in a growth market with strong margins. Also allows you to diversify away from EVs a bit.\n\nThe SPAC hasn't run yet, currently trading at $10.75 per share, so this has a lot of room to run. Very little downside, but huge potential upside.\n\nSources:\n\n[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201123005590/en/AvePoint-the-Largest-Microsoft-365-Data-Management-Solutions-Provider-Announces-2bn-Merger)\n\n[https://www.avepoint.com/](https://www.avepoint.com/)\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-cloud-partner-avepoint-going-public-via-merger-with-blank-check-company-apex-technology-2020-11-23)\n\n[https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/avepoint-public-via-spac-valued-160729256.html)\n\n[https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac](https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/20/11/18489999/microsoft-cloud-provider-avepoint-going-public-via-apex-technology-spac)\n\nDisclaimer: I have APXT shares and this does not constitute financial advice.", "id": "k0xve8", "created_utc": 1606329302.0, "score": 121, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 69, "comments": [{"body": "So we buy APXT and if the Merger goes through it auto updates to the new ticker right?", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Yep", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Sweet thanks, going to put 1k into this and see how it plays out.

The stock has a predictable pattern of ups and downs so i bet up. was right. but now it's time for the down turn. However we are dealing with some unique forces because a few idiots like Citron and other MSNBC homos think it's going to be the next AMZN. Besides all of u/yoinkedmustache points here ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jo4n9t/puts\\_on\\_nigerian\\_scam/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jo4n9t/puts_on_nigerian_scam/) ) there are additional reasons why JMIA is a bad company, which i think is why they've had to release a beautifully-designed powerpoint deck full of irrelevant bullshit numbers (with a focus on percentages, not the magnitude of their paltry numbers) to keep the confusion and bs charade going.\n\n\\-GMV is down by 15%. AMZN never once had a year where GMV was down from the year prior.\n\n\\-They have EUR 147M in cash, but their 9 month operating loss is EUR 109M. They spend EUR 72M in G&A costs (tech, execs, etc.) in 9 months. They need to raise cash. \n\n\\-They've slowed down on advertising (sounds like they're reaching their limit around EUR 150M in annual revenue)\n\n\\-All of their bullshit about user growth is because they keep adding verticals like food delivery, JumiaPay, gaming, etc. which are not likely to be profitable either.\n\n\\-Their 'business mix rebalancing' is a masterclass in stupidity. To turn the focus to fashion, beauty, home & living, FMCG away from difficult to find products like electronics is not going to work. \n\n   \\>The move to fashion, beauty, home & living, and FMGC seems smart for two reasons. \n\n\\+Firstly, as a consumer, you don't really need to worry about the quality of fashion products or FMGC, either it's built into the brand (Proctor & Gamble) or its a t-shirt/shoes and you don't really need to be concerned with the 'quality' of a t-shirt or shoes (they don't cost $1000 nor are they going to explode upon opening). Trust is one of the two biggest issues facing JMIA, the other being the unnecessity of shopping online Africa, where small shops line neighborhoods.\n\n\\++Study done which shows Africans have lower \"interpersonal trust\" than pretty much anywhere else in the world ([https://ourworldindata.org/trust](https://ourworldindata.org/trust)), which is not good for e-commerce.\n\n\\+ Secondly, the sellers of these products are typically smaller 'independent' businesses who JMIA can extract higher commissions from. 30% of total items sold on JMIA in 2019 were fashion or beauty products which are designed and manufactured by small local companies. The sellers also want an outlet to sell their products.\n\n\\-With the pivot toward fashion/beauty product they've brilliantly increased their competition with Facebook's suite of products (FB, Instagram, WhatsApp), which are wildly popular in Africa.\n\n\\-They're also competing with the millions of tiny little shops on the sides of the road, which are scattered across neighborhoods and main roads, which don't require you to wait, pay a delivery fee, or   worry about delivery, waste your time opening the app, etc.\n\nI'm sure there are 30 other reasons to short the shit out of the stock, but what is more a sign of death than slowing down growth when your an e-commerce platform in a market of 1.5B people (and you only have like 1-2% of the market as 'active users' which is a metric for anyone who bought something one-time in 12 months...to 'focus on profitability'.", "id": "k0ygls", "created_utc": 1606330974.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 61, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks, bought more PLTR", "score": 63, "replies": []}, {"body": "you write a lot of words so I trust you", "score": 24, "replies": []}, {"body": "haha the retardation is strong in this one, jokes aside, the growth potential is huge, thats what people are buying into, also, there are rumors of BABA providing that cash, one of the driving factors of the stock", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "China loves to invest in Africa so this wouldn’t surprise me.

EVERYONE in Africa uses digital payments. much further along in digital banking than US/Europe. digital payments are not even an interesting topic of discussion in Africa anymore because it's so widely used. but no consumers want to pay JMIA before they see the product in their hands. this is JMIA's challenge.\n\nbut they haven't solved it obviously and neither JumiaPay nor the 300 logistics partners (what does this even mean??? after, no doubt, tens of millions of dollars spent on building a logistics network they only have \\~300 \"partner\" guys on mopeds willing to drop off products across all their markets. Is this a joke?) the difficulty of getting people to buy online is either cultural & operational (JMIA's belief...trust & logistics) or it's because the market doesn't need shit like soap or a phone delivered to their doorstep (my belief...bad product-market fit).\n\nthe consumer retail sector is made up of thousands of small retailers on sides of the road in a given town/city. it is easier to find the household items you need in Africa than in the US. IMO, ecom is only useful for obscure items. Fashion/beauty products are a good ecom product... although FB, Instagram, Whatsapp are the competition in these sectors and are much more popular channels of selling these items than JMIA in Africa.\n\nJMIA's single skill is convincing dumb shit investors in New York/London that they have a handle on the African market even when they're 10 years behind the leaders in everything. company can last for 12 more quarters, but it's doomed. in the meanwhile it'll keep getting manipulated/moved around and might be a good way to make tendies on both the way up and down", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Are you comparing it to companies in counties that have imposed lockdowns? \n\nNot everyone on the continent uses digital payments. That's why they exited Tanzania, Cameroon, and Rwanda. \n\nI think the backing from MasterCard could help JumiaPay, but it still needs more adoption and people not wanting to use cash and, like you mentioned, see the product. So it's a cultural change that COVID is helping but again not at the clip rate that non-African ecomm businesses are seeing.\n\nThe logistics partnerships are similar to JD.  I agree that it could be run better. They keep surprising me at how they're not trying to innovate. They are starting to take market share from Konga and other local competitors.
