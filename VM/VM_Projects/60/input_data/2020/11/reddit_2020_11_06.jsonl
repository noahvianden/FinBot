{"title": "Having 100% in equities is superior to keeping an emergency fund, even in really bad case scenarios (market crash + losing your job)?", "selftext": "Someone on Bogleheads did an analysis backtesting a worst case scenario where an emergency occurred during a severe market crash (2002, 2008), where both investors lost their jobs and had to rely on either their emergency fund or stocks (100% VTI/VTSAX). The person who had to rely on stocks did better than the person who had an EF over a 20 year period. Obviously best case scenario where both investors maintained a full time job, 0% cash / 100% equities beats x% cash / 100-x% equities.\n\n[https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=311324](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=311324)\n\nSo it seems that cash really is trash. Even in situations where you need to deploy a lot of funds immediately, you can use credit for that, and then just pay it off after selling stocks or wait until next pay period.\n\nAlso I'm not saying that you should pursue this strategy, or that you shouldn't keep an emergency fund. Or that every scenario 100% equities beats having an emergency fund. Just thought this was an interesting post I discovered, because you'd expect having an EF is a hedge against worst case scenarios of job loss + market crash.
