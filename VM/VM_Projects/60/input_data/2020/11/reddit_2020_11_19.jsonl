This company will be worth trillions by 2030\n\nUnderstand that PLUG’s fuel cells already power thousands of commercial equipment such as forklifts and other supply chain hydraulic equipment. Seen a whole lot of people that think fuel cells don’t work, but I can assure you, it’s not the EV competitors that keep Elon Musk awake at night, it’s Andy Marsh and Plug Power. \n\nPLUG will be providing hydrogen units to power vehicles in the mid 2021, are prepared to assist OEM’s in installation and service (four major OEM’s confirmed and purchased). In other words, cars on the road in months, not years. But cars are just a side project for PLUG. \n\nThat’s right, cars are not even the main focus of this company, they are about to control the whole green hydrogen supply chain, and I’m going to break it down for you simply. I’ve been periodically rolling over options since PLUG was at $6, and it’s going to be my early retirement. \n\nHere’s why: \n\n1) Hydrogen power allows for instant refueling, and is optimized for engine sizes on long distance hauling compared to electric- yep, this means clean energy that you don’t have to charge. This means hydrogen can be used for planes, and logistically is the best choice for trucking. \n\n2) Plug power doesn’t just do cars and engines they also control the refueling stations. They already have a refueling line all along the east coast of the US. For those that purchase their drive units. \n\n3) They are the the main processor and distributor of green hydrogen, and are investing highly in its production \n\n4) They have developed large scale commercial power stations (the size of a tennis court) that can generate enough energy to manage major data and cloud businesses. This is the first efficient and green independent energy source ever created. This could would allow you to put a Walmart in the Sahara Desert, and it also means you don’t need to run electrical utilities from the grid to the business. \n\n\nThe Issues: \n\n1)first off understand that there is already electrical infrastructure across nearly the entire world. This is not a reality with hydrogen, which is why PLUG is so dedicated to building fueling stations right now. \n\n2) The next and main problem with PLUG power isn’t whether hydrogen works, it does, the problem is with making it a 100% clean energy, or green hydrogen. Right now most hydrogen comes from the separation and purification process of natural gasses, which is considered a dirty process, making that hydrogen not classified as green hydrogen. In order to achieve 100% green hydrogen, they must process hydrogen using solar and other forms of clean energy processes. PLUG and it’s associates in the sector must build a strong enough infrastructure in order to process and distribute enough green hydrogen to drop the price of clean hydrogen to a competitive price with other clean energy forms. \nPlug power is solving this, and well on its way to making, processing, and distributing enough clean hydrogen to drop the price of clean hydrogen to make it competitive with the price of electricity\n\nWith big moves being made to clean energy, PLUG is perfectly positioned and is a necessity for businesses that can’t stop moving to charge their equipment, and to get clean, commercial level power to areas that you can’t or isn’t financially feasible to run electrical utilities. Plug power is going to be one of the largest energy distributors in the world by 2030.  \n\nThey control nearly every bit of the process of bringing clean hydrogen to their own products, and control all the infrastructure. Best Buy you could ever make.\n\nHere are my roll over positions, total of around 1300% : [Positions](https://imgur.com/gallery/HXqWcrn)\n\nEdit of Edit: I’m not telling anyone that right now is the best time to buy weekly call options on PLUG. The reason I’m doing this is because I’ve come a crossed a variety of posts saying fuel cells don’t even work, along with a lot of incorrect, misinformation. I’m trying to explain simply what the company is doing outside of vehicles and because the engineering behind fuel cells, in addition to bringing hydrogen vehicles to the road is unquestionably more challenging then electric.

{"title": "RKT - Tesla of mortgage industry", "selftext": "Long time lurker, first time poster. Hope I meet the mark!!\n\nListen up retards! Some of you might have heard of Rkt mortgage. It had a hyped IPO in August at $18. Went up to 30+ in September with strong Q2 earnings and then down to 18 again in October. It's Q3 earnings were way above expectations of most analysts and even Jim Cramer recommended it a strong buy! (Link: [https://m.benzinga.com/article/18257619](https://m.benzinga.com/article/18257619))\n\nHere's why Rocket can go 2x or more soon:\n\n1. Rocket is just not another mortgage company. It is the biggest home mortgage player in US! Plus they are more of a Fintech company than a pure mortgage player. Just like Tesla used technology to make driving easier, Rocket technology makes the loan process simpler and faster!\n2. Their Q2 and Q3 earnings were way above analyst expectations! Q4 will be bigger and better! Why? Read this: [https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/11/12/investing/rocket-mortgage-buy-home-real-estate/index.html](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2020/11/12/investing/rocket-mortgage-buy-home-real-estate/index.html)\n3. Realising the current price of their stock is too low, Rocket announced $1bn share buyback program. This will drive the share prices in near term! Link: [https://m.benzinga.com/article/18309890](https://m.benzinga.com/article/18309890)\n4. Institutional ownership is just beginning to build-up for Rocket. Point72 (Steven Cohen) holds some minor stake in Rocket. More hedge funds are going to jump soon.\n5. Finally, given the near zero interest rate environment, mortgage players like Rocket will continue recording major gains for next 1-2 years!!\n6. Last bonus point (speculation and not confirmed) - Buffett recently filed 13f didn't include some of the stocks that he is secretly building a position. Rumours are that he is investing in Fintech company. Buffett is known to be investing early into companies and RKT might be part of his portfolio!!\n\nSummary - Rocket will be $40+ or $50+ stock soon.
