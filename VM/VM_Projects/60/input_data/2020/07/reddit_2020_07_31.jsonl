{"title": "Understanding common misconceptions surrounding stock splits", "selftext": "Welcome to my latest Ted talk!\n\nEvery other post seems to be about the announcement from Apple ($AAPL) in regards to their 4-1 stock split. There seems to be a lot of misconceptions around stock splits. In an attempt to help out the community I’m going to answer some of the common questions I’ve been seeing lately.\n\nFirst off, *what happens when a company splits their stock?*\n\nIn the case of $AAPL, the stock is splitting 4-1. On August 31st the shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis. If the shares pre-split were trading for $400 a share, post-split they will be trading for $100 a share. The number of shares in circulation as a result will increase by 4x. **This means the companies valuation will not change.**\n\n*What about my options contract?*\n\nThe vast majority of time with a conventional split like what we will see with $AAPL, options contracts will be adjusted similar to conventional stock ownership. If you own 1 400c contract, post-split you’ll own 4 100c options. While I don’t expect this outcome, it is also possible for a non-standard options contract instead. Non-standard contracts are common with reverse splits, not very common with this sort of split. \n\n*What about dividends?*\n\nThe dividend yield is expressed as a percentage. 1% (rounding up) will be same regardless if you own 1 share at $400 or 4 shares at $100. \n\n*Should you buy before the stock split or after?*\n\nWhile a stock may see increased volatility post-split, investing in a company should be done when you as the investor feel the stock is undervalued. This may be pre-split or post-split based on price action. If you are actively trading you may be able to take a speculative position pre-split with the assumption that post-split there will be increased interest in the stock and thus an increase in share price. There is no guarantee we’ll experience a post-split rally though.\n\n**Bottom Line**\n\nFundamentally nothing changes with a stock pick. When companies execute stock splits they’re simply reducing the cost and thus the barrier to entry for small time investors. \n\nThank you for attending my latest Ted Talk.", "id": "i12p6p", "created_utc": 1596177215.0, "score": 388, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 57, "comments": [{"body": "Shoutout to you for this one, will probably save a lot of people from iffy decisions", "score": 81, "replies": [{"body": "One thing he didn’t mention- a company will only do a split when they are absolutely killing it.

Be kind.\n\nI get that nothing effectively changes when this stock splits on Aug 24. Someone who owns 100 shares will then own 400 and $40k is $40k regardless if they own 100 shares at $400 or 400 shares at $100.\n\nThat aside - isn’t the (likely upward) volatility going to be incredibly higher for Apple at $100 than if the stock didn’t split and floated around $400? Isn’t Apple such a rock star stock that retail investors are going to flood into it when they can buy at $100? And thus wouldn’t larger investors be interested in buying at pre-split valuations on the assumption that there will be an increase in volatility after the split?\n\nOf course I understand that fractional shares are already popular right now. However seems like retail investors will react differently to the option to own full shares rather than fractional, and that my speculative “rush” will be a benefit for larger institutional investors. I know this is just an assumption that the market will respond this way - but in I can’t see how current shareholders won’t drastically benefit from the volatility around this news. None of which would happen if the stock didn’t split.\n\nAm I totally off base here?", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "While the post is mostly truthful, it's also incorrect to say there isn't price fluctuation as a direct result. \n\nA quick explanation :\n\nMost of the time companies utilize stock splits for one of two reasons. \n\n1. A reverse split can occur when a stock is in danger of dropping too low. In one scenario, it may drop to $0.00. By doing Reverse split, a single share will alter its value from let's say $1.00 to $10.00 in a 1:10 reverse split. This usually occurs when the stock is dropping and is generally considered bad news for a company. HOWEVER... Many brokerages don't list stocks which trade under $5.00. So, suddenly a reverse split opens up access to the stock to a lot more people. So, about 70% of the time (from 2019-2020) a reverse split had a volume bump and increased % gain in the week or two after. But this lasts merely a day at max.\n\n2. The share has become too expensive for a certain audience to include it in their portfolios. This is more common with normal splits. For example, you want a diverse portfolio with an even $ amount of Tesla, Facebook, Google and some startup. Let's say you only have $2000.00 though. So you would use up almost all of your cash buying one share of Tesla and failing to get your portfolio ratio. But if Tesla split to say $250. You could try to buy in some way that says roughly $500 of each stock until your $2000 is used and your portfolio is even ratio. \n\nIn both scenarios, stocks are more widely available and therefor a volume increase (hopefully price increase)can be expected. Generally, normal splits are considered good news for a company because the stock is trending up in price. Normal splits should be regarded as more long term potential volume increases and positive growth than reverse splits.", "score": 15, "replies": [{"body": "The way I see it is that if Apple thought that the current market price was temporarily $400, then they wouldn't split because it would go back down to an affordable price i.e. $200 just 1 year ago, which would make it accessible.\n\nBy doing a 4-1 split I take it also as a signal that Apple is confident that their current price accurately reflects what the company thinks it will be worth at the lower end in the future so they need to split to make it accessible.\n\nPositive signal even though the split itself all else being equal has no impact on market cap", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "1. A reverse split is essentially a company issuing new guidance that their stock price is about to tank or they are at imminent risk of being de-listed from an exchange or index following the next earnings call. Normal splits need not have anything to do with guidance. I don't think you're reducing anyone's confusion by making this point. \n\n2. In general small retail investors reactions to splits do not move markets. Popular platforms like Robinhood already offer fractional shares, and investors can access these companies through thousands of lower priced ETFs if they really desire to own them. If anything is causing these small time investors to increase their positions it's the increased media coverage surrounding high profile splits like Apple, not the actual split.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I tracked reverse splits for a long period of time and did my research. \n\nBut I'll take your comment into consideration.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Your second Point goes directly against every article and definition of a split that I have read.

If a retail investor isn't aware of a company a split isn't going to magically draw them in. What draws them in is the buzz surrounding the split. Articles popping up about how it's a good sign, talking heads covering the split on their programs, that kind of thing. It's not like some B2B corporation that the average person has never heard of can just split their stock and attract a bunch of retail investors, Apple is doing this because they expect their mind games to work because they are so customer-facing as a brand already. \n\nAnd even if small retail investors increase their holdings, that doesn't necessarily move the market. It could just be good for their brand reputation metrics that more retail investors hold their stock. A guy with 1 share of apple in his Robinhood app doesn't move the market, but if that ownership motivates him to go online and fanboy for the company all day and buy their products then it's certainly something they'd like to encourage.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "You forgot the impact of liquidity \n\nTake Apple \nThe lower share price and increased outstanding shares increases liquidity. \n\nIf I was sitting on a pile of shares, it got easier to sell some.
