{"title": "Intel stock savaged as next-gen chip delay expected to be ‘increasingly painful’ to chip maker", "selftext": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/intel-stock-savaged-as-next-gen-chip-delay-prompts-loss-of-confidence-from-wall-street-2020-07-24\n\n\nIntel Corp.’s stock logged one of its worst days in 20 years Friday after the chip giant divulged that its next generation of chips would be delayed and that it may seek a third-party manufacturer to make them, handing a huge win to smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc.\n\nIntel INTC, -16.24% shares closed down 16.2% at $50.59 Friday, after dropping below $50 for the first time in five months. The one-day drop was the stock’s worst since March, when it finished down 18%, but that was amid a broader market rout when the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.61% tanked 12% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.93% had its worst day ever with a 12.3% dive. In comparison, the S&P 500 was only off 0.6% Friday, and the Nasdaq finished down 0.9%.\n\nOther than the March 16 rout, Intel shares have only seen worse days three other times over the past 20 years, two 18% drops in 2002 and a 22% drop in 2000.\n\nLate Thursday, Intel said it was delaying its 7-nanometer line of chips by at least six months because of a “defect mode” and that it may have to resort to a contingency plan of using “somebody else’s foundry” to make them. In chip parlance, nanometers, or nm, refers to the size of the transistors that go on a computer chip, with the general rule being that smaller transistors are faster and more efficient in using power.\n\nAs a result, shares of AMD AMD, +16.50%, which already sells 7-nm chips, soared 16.5% to close at a record $69.40, only the second time AMD has ever closed at a higher stock price than Intel. Meanwhile, American depositary receipts of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM, +9.69%, which makes AMD’s chips, rallied 9.7%. to close at $73.90.\n\nIntel, on Friday, shed $41.54 billion in market capitalization, putting it far behind Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +0.63% in the previously close race for most valuable U.S. chip maker. Nvidia shares finished Friday up 0.6% at $407.78 for a market cap of $250.78 billion, versus Intel’s $214.2 billion.", "id": "hxexbs", "created_utc": 1595643417.0, "score": 201, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 65, "comments": [{"body": "Shoutout to the guy that posted saying short Intel when Jim Keller left.", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "The writing has been on the wall for a while, almost at least 6 months that Intel chip fabrication and response to AMD is not gonna happen for a long while.

AMD cpu desktop chips for enthusiasts have been out selling Intel for almost a year...but ultimately it made me assume, and still may be true, that the current f up they are in is just a couple of their rods in the fire...aka they are so big a company the impact, although seems big to everyday people, isn't that large to them as a whole.\n\nI do think the fabrication issue is the main reason of the price drop.  Intel was fine losing the small desktop CPU market as it's not that large.
