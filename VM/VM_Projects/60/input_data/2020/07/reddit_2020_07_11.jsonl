The company is a cloud-based SaaS platform for banks built on the Salesforce platform. There are plenty of inefficiencies still within the world of banking today and nCino offers banks a solution to some of that, most importantly a revenue positive solution. Do they offer more than just buzzword meme potential though?\n\n>On average, financial institutions using nCino’s Bank Operating System have enjoyed a 40% decrease in loan closing time, a 92% reduction in servicing costs, and a 127% increase in account opening completion rates.\n\nThe numbers don't just come from a handful of obscure banks, they already have a sizeable list of clients. See banks over 10 billion: https://www.ncino.com/success/banks-over-10-billion\n\n$138.2M of revenue in FY20 for +51% growth YoY and $44.7M of revenue in FY Q1'21, for +50% growth YoY. Ended FY20 with 1,180+ total customers across 10 countries. nCino ended last quarter at $139.3M of implied ARR, also being +66% growth YoY.\n\nnCino has 12 issued patents and one patent pending; I'm not autistic enough to try and figure out how huge these patents are, but it at least implies they have a decent amount of proprietary technology making it harder for anyone to try and rip off a clone of their service and offer it for cheaper.\n\nLike any startup, there is some cash burn. GAAP losses increased from $4.6m FY19 to $9m FY20. The important thing here though is operating margin has been seeing steady growth and GAAP losses as a % have been steadily decreasing. The first slide on the charts and graphs link really helps put into perspective how good their numbers have looked. When you offer a comprehensive service that you can point to a history of being revenue positive for other clients, it's easy to see how this company could be going places from the IPO price.\n\nCharts, graphs: https://imgur.com/a/2fHifbw\n\n**GOCO**\n\nGoHealth\n\nPrice Range: $18.00 - $20.00\n\nShares:39,500,000\n\nMarket Cap: 5.96B\n\nWeBull Expected Listing Date: 2020-07-15\n\nTheir summary of the company:\n\n>As a leading health insurance marketplace, GoHealth's mission is to improve access to healthcare in America. Enrolling in a health insurance plan can be confusing for customers, and the seemingly small differences between plans can lead to significant out-of-pocket costs or lack of access to critical medicines and even providers. GoHealth combines cutting-edge technology, data science and deep industry expertise to match customers with the healthcare policy and carrier that is best for them. Since its inception, GoHealth has enrolled millions of people in Medicare and individual and family plans. \n\nAlthough they have a fair amount of long-term debt ($840 million in total liabilities) they have already had years generating a profit. From FY 2019-20 they had a profit of $1.4m on $114m of revenue. Not a lot sure, but TDOC has never posted a profit and LVGO scrapes by a few pennies per share right now; with their very impressive revenue growth and swinging trend toward positive cashflow, there aren't any major short-term red flags.\n\nIBISWorld forecasts the market for online insurance brokerage to reach $31.3 billion in 2020 and the average annual growth in online insurance has been just under 10% YoY for the past 5 years so this is a growing market segment. Specifically relevant to this, there are a ton of Boomers set to retire over the next 5 years meaning more people funneling into Medicare.\n\nOnly images of financial data I could find: https://imgur.com/a/Z17KZqf", "id": "hpkk5f", "created_utc": 1594511705.0, "score": 90, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 60, "comments": [{"body": "\"nCino hits all the hot Momo buzzwords in the **COVID** market.
