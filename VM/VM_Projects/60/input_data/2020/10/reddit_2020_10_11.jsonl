I own a bunch of calls and am considering trimming positions a little to take some profits. I figured it would be good to consolidate together a bunch of the DD and points I've seen on this sub over the last month\n\nI understand the short squeeze theory: right now \\~106% of shares outstanding and more like \\~150% of the public float is shorted.\n\nFor a short squeeze, you need one of these things to happen:\n\n* A large shareholder rapidly buying shares and then saying they are not going to lend these shares out (see what happened with Porsche-Volkswagen in 2008)\n* Merger & acquisition rumors / speculation\n* Change in long-term prospects of the business that fundamentally changes the thesis of everyone short\n* Catalyst for capitulation of the shorts (i.e. they realize they are wrong / are losing too much money in the short-term and close out positions)\n\nIn the case of GME:\n\n* Shorts have not started capitulating - the short interest chart above shows short interest as % of shares outstanding actually increasing over the past several months\n* The Microsoft news is a bit of non-news, but could also be a positive:\n   * The partnership does not appear to have any meaningful economics for GME\n   * However, the positive signaling is that why would Microsoft announce a long-term partnership with GME if they don't think it will be around for at least a couple more years\n   * Longer-term, if the partnership is valuable for Microsoft, there could be more meaningful support / economics provided to GME\n* Ryan Cohen (Chewy Co-Founder) has taken a meaningful stake (just shy of 10%)\n   * Helps remove a large % of shares out of the public float\n   * If he gets more involved, perhaps he has a vision for how to transform GME in a more digital videogame world - this would be a big catalyst\n* Michael Burry still owned a meaningful chunk as of 6/30/2020 - will be interesting to see what his holdings look like on the next report date (by large chunk, I mean \\~4.2%)\n* Most importantly, the thesis of hedge funds that are short has not changed - the medium-term prospects of GME are bleak, especially after the initial wave of foot traffic from the console sales\n   * Mall traffic is down - COVID only accelerated the decline of malls\n   * GME's footprint of 5,500+ stores seems like its unsustainable in the long-run - question is can they trim the footprint fast enough to a smaller, more profitable footprint that they will be around in the long-run\n* The short squeeze feels like it will be a battle of who has more conviction and a longer time horizon - the hedge funds who are short or the WSB traders who are long\n   * I love all of you guys, but I don't have much faith in WSB having more conviction / longer investment horizon than hedge funds (and by longer I mean who is willing to hold their position for a year to see it play out)\n\nI do agree with the members on this sub that you can make money trading GME in the short-term, potentially seeing a rally up - but this is probably not going to be a LT winner\n\nPlease add anything you think I have missed or where you think I am wrong\n\nPosition: $6c 1/15/2021 since mid Sep (screenshot attached)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yihcu5ek5hs51.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fd577feada0cf138dea766ca6b93e30fb8f7ade\n\nEdit #1: as u/invader2 pointed out, the stakes of Ryan Cohen and Michael Burry were 9.96% and 4.2%, respectively.
