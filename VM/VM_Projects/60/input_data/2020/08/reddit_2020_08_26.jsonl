WORK is going down, and honestly, who uses it anyway?\n\nim beginning to believe that you might be slightly stupid because you’re just assuming that i believe $work is the future when i never hinted at anything along those lines and you continue to derail from the main topic of discourse. my statement from the beginning was that there are other etfs that better measures $work’s performance than spy. spy has almost consistently been green like the past 3 weeks whereas $work has mostly seen red. in what world is spy a good tracker for $work? it’s a foolish statement.\n\nalso, if you look at my post history, i think the stock is dog shit. but i yolo’d my entire portfolio because i believe that there will be a run-up before earnings.\n\nit’s baffling how you haven’t been hit by a train yet lol.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Hey OP, what do you think of these [google trends results](https://i.imgur.com/thRtM53.png)?\n\nI tried different keywords for Slack, including download, install, etc., and all seemed pretty flat aside from the March/April spike and maybe a small uptick here and there.
