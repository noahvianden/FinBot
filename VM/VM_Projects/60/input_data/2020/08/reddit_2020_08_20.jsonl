They have released the ID.3 (a compact hatchback that is the similar size of the legendary Golf but more practical, hence there is no internal combustion engine). There was a leak yesterday that another model of the ID family will be produced from september until 2023, the ID.4. That's an SUV. Deliveries of the ID.3 are starting september, there are 37k orders for it (Volkswagen expected 30k orders). It is slightly cheaper than the Tesla model 3 but is also slower.

They had the huge dieselgate scandal in 2015 which cost them over $34 billion. The thing is that will be the past, as there can not be any more lies around the emissions of the vehicles (EVs). They have mass produced legendary cars like the Beetle and the Golf. This company survived World War 2 and I see no reason for it to not survive the pandemic.

But don‚Äôt you have to pay taxes when you sell all your positions and transfer it to your bank?\n\nNo, At least not immediately. I'll get a 1099 come tax time for 2021 and have to pay whatever is owed to Uncle Sam. Standard stuff. This year I'll have (2) 1099's (1) from TD and (1) TW. Tax consequences on capital gains (short/long) are due only once a year, unless you decide to pay them quarterly to the IRS. \n\nIf you transfer your brokerage balance to your checking account, you don't pay taxes on the full distribution, just the capital gains. Unless it's a qualified IRA or 401(k), then you would just have taxes (fed/state) deducted out before the transfer. That TD account was 7.8k. I've only made $884 in short term capital gains since opening that account to trade thetagang strategies. \n\nI'm not taxed again on the initial 7k I used to fund that account. Being, all of that money came from my income and was already taxed out of my paychecks. I will however have to pay taxes in 2021 on the $884 in short term capital gains included in the distribution. If that makes more sense. 7k already was taxed when I got my checks and saved it up, the $884 is my capital gain and will get taxed acccordingly at the end of the year. \n\n> By transferring your positions from ToS to TW directly, you could avoid paying taxes.\n\nYou can not avoid paying taxes by sheltering capital gains funds in your brokerage account. Whoever told you that was misinformed. There is always a tax liability on your gains whether you transfer the funds to another broker or to your bank account. Your yearly 1099 will give you the breakdown. By transfering to my bank and closing my TD account I avoided the $95 trade-in-kind fee from TD to TastyWorks. The tax implications are the same whether you hold your gains in a brokerage sweep or deposit them to your checking account. It will all be on your 1099(s). And you can always do a wash sale to up to 3k to lower your tax liability.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Oh. I get what you‚Äôre saying.\n\nBut if you held a stock for less than a year, it makes sense to transfer the stock to your new broker and sell it after a year so that you‚Äôre only taxed at the long term capital gains rate and not the short term.
