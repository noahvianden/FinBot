{"title": "Are TSLA options mispriced or am I dumb?", "selftext": "Unless I've done something wrong (totally possible) it seems like I could make a really wild trade with TSLA options. The trade involves a debit call spread combined with shorting the stock. The position this makes is kind of (but definitely not) risk-free and is similar to borrowing money at a negative interest rate. I would love to hear your thoughts on this!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo as a newer options trader I've been lamenting the fact that when you buy options you normally get hurt over time due to premium decay. So I decided to see if I could find a long position in an options trade that would instead net me premium.\n\nBUT WAIT! ISN'T THAT TOTALLY ASS BACKWARD? Yep... (and I found one)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRight now TSLA is trading at $1562 and I was kind of interested in buying the $1500 TSLA call but it had a huge premium. The option is priced at roughly $300 right now, of which $62 is intrinsic value and $238 is premium. So to offset the premium I investigated creating a debit spread by selling the $1625 Dec 18th call which is priced at $251 (all premium).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUp front this would have cost me $49/share which seems reasonable. But I got really curious looking at the premium portions of the calls.\n\n$238 - $251 = -$13\n\nThis means my position would be +$62 intrinsic combined with -$13 premium paid. Diving further into this if TSLA tanked to $1500 or below I would lose $49 but it went up to $1625 or above I would gain $76.\n\nPut another way... if the stock falls $62 I lose $49, if the stock rises $63 I gain $76. No matter what price the stock ended up at I always got the change in the stock price (only between $1500-1625) plus (roughly) $13\n\n**MY MIND WAS BLOWN**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBeing the greedy capitalist bastard that I am... I thought well why cant I just make the $13 without the risk of the stock at this point, not even WallStreetBets cares about TSLA. So I devised an evil plan... what if at the same time that I enter the debit call spread I also short TSLA. That way I always make my $13 (or part of it) as long as I exit the position before TSLA price goes above $1625 or below $1500. Oh.. and it comes with an added benefit of being able to use the short sale proceeds to buy the position in the first place and the extra can go in something REAL exciting like treasuries.\n\n**MY MIND WAS BLOWN AGAIN - I CAN BORROW MONEY AND GET PAID FOR IT?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow I bet I know what you're thinking a $62 move in TSLA stock is like a rounding error these days and I would probably only earn 1 cent of premium before I would have to sell the position due to reaching the top or bottom end of the spread. Well... you're right but look at the other Dec 18th calls (note that both strikes are roughly symmetrical distance from spot price +490 and -490)\n\n1070 TSLA Dec 18 call costs $557 ($490 intrinsic, $67 premium)\n\n2050 TSLA Dec 18 call costs $142 (all premium)\n\n$67 - $142 = -$75\n\nShorting 1 share provides me with a credit of $1562\n\nTaking the debit spread (on one share) costs $415\n\nI invest the remaining $1147 at some tiny interest rate (like robinhoods 0.3%APY)\n\nSlowly earn my $67 premium\n\nWait & Profit??\n\nExit whole position if it ever gets uncomfortably close to either side of the spread (especially the top end)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I missing something? Is this why there are so many short sellers in TSLA stock? Is it free money? Maybe this is because stuff is mispriced due to the market not being open?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nBy my calculations by using a debit call spread on TSLA and shorting the stock at the same time (with stop losses near the strikes on the spread) someone could borrow money and get paid for it\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPLEASE NOTE: I AM A NOOB AND THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO MAKE THIS TRADE (AND NONE OF MY COMMENTS ARE EITHER).

So, $TSLA is priced at $1,554.76 for these options. A 12/18 $1,050C has an ask price of $562.20 (because we are buying it) and a 12/18 $2050C has a bid price of $136.90 since we are going to sell it.\n\n\nBuying a call is a very basic way to hedge a short position. Let's make all contracts based on 1 share for smaller numbers. \n\nYou short 1 share for $1,554.76, and buy 1 $1,070C for $562.2, netting you $992.54. No matter how high the stock goes, your net loss is only $77.46 as this is the difference between how much you net from covered short and the strike price of the call, before accounting for interest and dividends on the stock (that you'll owe).\n\nWith this position, you won't make a profit either unless TSLA goes under $992.54 as your call will expire worthless and you'll just buy back the share to cover your short and net the difference. \n\nNow, let's add the sale of the $2,050 call. All this does is adds $136.90 to the balance, and now your short position is no longer covered, but now you'll start to make money if TSLA goes below $1,129.44. All the sale of the call does is add a normal short to your covered short. You still want $TSLA to drop with this play.\n\nAs price goes up, closer to the $2,050 range, your $1,070C will cover your short (with a net loss of $77.46), but you'll have to start at looking to buy back that $2,050C that is now worth more than the $136.90 you got for it, unless theta decay outpaced it which I doubt since it's way out in DEC.\n\nEdit: tl;dr, this is like selling a call, but with extra steps.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Assuming TSLA price doesnt skyrocket and you are forced to exit early you get your \\~$80 at expiration if TSLA price is between 1050 and 2050.

I’m not buying personally because I like riding my bike on the real trails :)", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Fuck pton", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Are you on the right post?
