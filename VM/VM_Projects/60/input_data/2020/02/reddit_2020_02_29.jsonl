{"title": "A (better) DD on Trump brief today.", "selftext": "Throwing shade intentional. lmao only mentions 3M.\n\nMy notes from the call today. TL;DR at bottom for you illiterate degenerates.\n\nAnyways:\n\n* Movers\n   * Big pharma to visit WH Monday to discuss detection solutions, possibly vaccines.\n      * No name mentioned, just 'industry'\n      * Original meeting was to discuss lowering pharma costs (so Trump said).\n   * 3M contracted for 35M more masks. Markets may have reacted to this Friday (see: [https://ibb.co/nrP5n1y](https://ibb.co/nrP5n1y)). Hard to say. I just like pretty pictures don't @ me.\n   * Travel bans and restrictions announced, more considered. Airlines gonna be hurting.\n* Markets\n   * \"Fed should be doing more\".\n      * Wants lower rates for us, as well as to refinance debt for a better rate.\n      * Compared us to other countries with lower rates.\n      * No specifics mentioned outside of doing more, lowering rates.\n   * This is just a funny side note: 10 minutes later, responding to another question, Trump said market will take care of itself. lmao\n   * Asked directly about gov't intervention (i.e., tax cuts). NO TAX CUTS to accelerate market.\n      * Declined to say they were considering anything not already announced (read you idiots: priced in) such as the middle-income tax later this year.\n* New travel restrictions\n   * Travel BANNED from Iran\n   * Travel advisory level 4 (highest) from parts of S. Korea and Italy (where infected people are duh).\n      * Also talking to those gov't about medical screening for incoming travel.\n* Virus Specifics\n   * lmao don't be around sick people.\n   * Will see more cases.\n   * Literally said \"Do not panic\".\n   * Honestly seems like they're making serious efforts to contain it. We'll see how it plays out in practice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSummary\n\nLong or short big pharma, who fucking knows. Wanting to discuss lowering prices is probably going to cause fear for investors around profits, but having the WH dick in your honeypot for the cure to the beer flu probably looks good. Goodluck on this.\n\n3M Long, prior to Jan 28th traded for >175, sits at 150. My play would be 4/17 170c and wait for tendies. Will probably spike up though Monday morning on briefing, so, you know, buy high you idiots.\n\nShort AAL, UAL, SAVE, DAL, etc. Further restrictions likely coming.\n\nDidn't really inspire confidence in market but I wouldn't be surprised by a statement from JP Sunday night re: rate cuts and an optimistic market moving into Tuesday. After that who fucking knows I'm not an oracle, just a gambler with a problem.\n\nAs always, disclaimer: My positions are 3/2 3/4 3/6 and 3/6 puts on SPY.\n\nTL;DR long 3m (4/17 170c) short airlines (figure it out) goodluck on pharma", "id": "fbi6i0", "created_utc": 1583006606.0, "score": 72, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 67, "comments": [{"body": "Your tl;dr is tl;dr", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "long 3m short airlines goodluck on pharma\n\ngot you fam - but also edited post", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks fam", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Bro they're not doing anything to contain it.
