{"title": "Too much bullshit here about inflation", "selftext": "TL;DR Genuinely, if you believe the US is in any way shape or form teetering on the edge of inflation (or, lmao, hyperinflation), you're retarded.\n\nThe short of it is inflation happens when there is too much money floating around for too little supply. The value of your currency goes down with supply/demand, and goods goes up with supply/demand. Bread starts costing $20 and hookers and blow skyrocket to the millions. Many here seem to think the Fed overheating their printer will lead to inflation: they're retarded. Dollars don't exist just in the US, and they don't exist eternally either. There are many foreign countries who need to pay back their loans in dollars, and therefore buy dollars from us to pay them off. They also use dollars to buy US goods and services. Don't get me started on how the eurodollar works, that's another rabbit hole. In addition, when a company goes bankrupt or defaults, whatever money sitting on that balance sheet goes poof. Zilch. Nada. It's fairy dust, it doesn't exist. \n\nThe US is also a much stronger country than we were back in the 1930s. So strong, in fact, that we can literally print up enough money to crash *other* people's economies. We couldn't do that in the 30s. The last thing on JPow's mind as he cranks that printing lever is inflation. The real issue is deflation, this is what happens when there are not enough dollars flowing through the system. If you have dollars and I have goods that you want to purchase, it works, but what if now you want to use those dollars but there's nothing that you want to purchase? The flow of liquidity in the system stops when consumption goes down, regardless of the supply of goods or the supply of cash. Inflation is a supply-side problem, deflation is a demand side. It is very easy to control supply of both US dollars and US goods, it is *not* easy to control demand for those goods and dollars. As I mentioned before the main demand right now is dollar loans from foreign countries. When banks no longer want to lend money to companies, the Fed has to step in to backstop it with their money printer or the whole system crashes, that's why JPow is revving the alphabet soup as we speak.\n\nDon't worry about inflation, worry about deflation because that's what'll really cause companies and banks to go bankrupt/default in the long run", "id": "g1cetl", "created_utc": 1586893468.0, "score": 24, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 64, "comments": [{"body": "Deflation is coming, just give it some time.

{"title": "Writing on the wall.", "selftext": "This post is stemming from a comment I liked which asks some intelligent questions:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/dragonuity/comments/fvj24m/my_magnum_opus/fnaiaf7/\n\nOriginally, that was meant to just be an archive subreddit. Changed my mind when I received some nice comments lmao.\n\nTo preface: Yea I'm borderline insane.\n\nOk Wallstreetbets.\n\nhere goes nothing. . .\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fyqgre/itll_soon_be_apparent_that_the_us_is_going_to/ \n\n>I saw that post made on wsb, I think I linked it somewhere actually, and it made me pretty happy that my claims were being substantiated by someone within academia independently. If what he claims is true, and the IMHE model is, as I have heard myself, simple curve fitting. I find that pathetic; it can be done on python linear regression modules in a couple of minutes. \n\nI recently looked through one of the most recent models produced by Morgan Stanley (I don’t have an exact date but my friend acquired it sometime during the weekend), I suppose I can point out in detail which part of the current models I hate the most. It’s everything after the top-- which I think will be fairly accurate: \n\nToo many assumptions are being made on containment that get egregiously worse on the way down. Each inaccuracy from the top down build on one another creating a giant avalanche of error. It certainly doesn’t help that the predictions closer to the bottom become very quickly, much more difficult. Alright here’s the graph and I’ll provide some of my personal commentary as well as expectations. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Where the next wave of models might go wrong.** (Notice: I purposely didn't use 'When')\n\n&nbsp;\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/GhiQZgh \n\n&nbsp;\n\n0 : The top. This is going to be fairly accurate with the current data. Might still be a little off even. \n\n1: Initial dropoff. Wishful thinking at best. They’re still assuming ideal conditions for such a sharp dropoff. Last time I checked we didn’t have any mandatory/enforced lockdowns to warrant this steep of an initial dropoff nor the will to. Also when has anything related to testing been on schedule? Is the virus suppose to go away with the heat? It’s not. Ideal. Conditions. \n\n2:  Road to containment. It’s starting to get bullshit. Google+Apple colab is op-in optional, what I'd guess <30% which won’t be significant at all. Everyone still remembers Snowden’s warnings in the back of their minds about a surveillance state. We’re not South Korea. Even Singapore got put into lockdown recently despite its initial success against the virus. An un-containable virus is not going away without drastic measures. Our government officials have demonstrated as much that they are not willing to resort to said measures. Their reactions reflect the feelings of their constituents-- we also hate following rules that infringe on our own privacy and freedoms; the country has to date only been told to stay at home-- even kids won’t listen, why would adults? As far as I see it, the risk is worth the reward. Without compelling reason to, people are not going to change their habits of going out and give up their social lives overnight. Humans are inherently social creatures. Furthermore:\n\nNobody in their right minds, unless they’re forced to, is going to stay at home for over a full month, especially not Americans. If 1. relied on 10 things going right, 2. relies on a magnitude higher, 100.  \n\n3: Containment. Is this some type of fairy tale? This virus has not been contained anywhere yet. There’s too many things wrong with this. It’s not disappearing by August. And what’s to say a 2nd wave of infections is gonna wait conveniently months after the first wave and not start before the 1st wave is over? What about a possible 3rd 4th wave? What if that makes the 1st wave never stop? Why only 2? Why are there periods with 0 cases of the virus in this graph? That alone makes me want to tear it up. If there’s any cases, there’s going to be a lot; we know that much. It’s not going away without a vaccine. I don’t even know why they had the audacity to put a 2nd wave anywhere on this fucking graph without putting asterisks everywhere. Might as well buy a lotto ticket. This part of the graph is about as accurate as winning a jackpot or finding a miracle cure. Did they superimpose China’s graph for this part?  Their entire biotechnology research team should be axed for using China’s pandemic data as legitimate data-points, ridiculous.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>I’m not providing any evidence. The evidence is everywhere. I’m rambling. But I’m more coherent then whoever was drunk enough to green-light these graphs without the blatant intention of misleading the public. They might as well have drawn a straight line down from the peak to 0. If the virus was going to magically go away anyways, why not all at once? Why wait? There’s no room for any sort of setback for this graph. The real thing is going to be drawn out by many months at least. Anyways. . .\n\n&nbsp;\n\n0 >> 1 >> 2 >> 3 in terms of difficulty to predict as well as number of underlying conditions that have to go favorably or on schedule. We have not been on schedule on anything so far. Why do we expect the federal government and state governments to suddenly start working together? They’re currently still outbidding each other on medical supplies. There’s too many assumptions for this to be a proper model. Why are they still modeling Covid after previous diseases? \n\n>My personal feelings: I don’t think we’re returning work in any way shape or form until, at the very earliest, fall. And that’s me being overly optimistic. We might not be able to return back at all, except in small quantities, to be perfectly honest. Any Covid graph that looks easy on the eyes and clean should be illegal. It might as well be drawn free-handed. I would really like to know how these things graphs are generated with no evidence. This graph doesn’t even deserve to be called an estimate. It’s so incredibly lazy and bullshit. *It's because it doesn't matter. They can always adjust it later on, just like the rest of their \"forecasts\" on the economy.*\n\nAny actual estimate would have to take over 1000 pages to look at hundreds of moving parts/components and verifying every underlying assumption. They most likely procrastinated really hard and had around 10 if I had to guess. I bet 5 of them relied on empty-nothing burger promises being rolled out/executed properly by our model government, and the other 5 relied on faulty data from China’s “miracle containment story” or low number case behavior from role-model countries, Taiwan, South Korea, ect.. It ain’t their first rodeo. We’re the noobs this time, not them. Bad graphs are easy to make if you’re allowed to make endless assumptions with little to no care. Good graphs are not, because you can’t afford to. It’s not their job to make good graphs. This *thing* will never be fully contained, no matter how much we test, without a vaccine. \n\nEnd of ultra speculative section. \n\n>The graph was so bad I struggled to write this section. I could’ve cleaned every up and made it sound nice. But I’m honestly flabbergasted. I’m incredulous. They can’t be serious. Why am I taking something seriously that wasn't meant to be? This begs the question . . .\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen might these new models break?\n\n Watch how the peak forms and as it goes into the initial dropoff. If it’s not a steep dropoff you can bet your asses they’re going back to the drawing board soon. It’s a weird getup where any changes especially near the top of the pyramid as it’s coming downwards will only amplify the issues with these forecasts. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Actually none of anything above this section matters. It's the wrong frame of mind. But it makes good practice for myself.**\n\n>Sorry to disappoint you. Well then that was a total waste of time wasn’t it? Not really, but we shouldn’t care have to care when forecasts turn sour because they don’t matter anymore. These graphs are not meant to be accurate. I’m sure that they’re going to be making their moves well before this happens again. But it’s an important exercise to see where they’re at. It’s an unspoken agreement between all the firms. They’re buying time for *something*. Even if this was meant to be internal and passed around like hot cakes it’s to make their average employees believe in the Cinderella story, that they’re working for a better cause. But make no mistake, there’s some super secret restricted model/predictions only seen by a couple higher-ups most likely. I’m going to go out on a limb and guess here, but it’s not going to be nearly as pretty. Or is there? No that can't possibly be!\n\nWe arrive then at the seemingly obvious conclusion:\n\n*The Fed/gov/banks must be conspiring against us. Their actions are dangerous to the American people.* But . . .\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**This conclusion can also be considered close-minded and should be relinquished in my opinion.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI for one, am guilty guilty of thinking like this not to long ago-- actually when the fed announced they were going to buy junk bonds that was my initial reaction. But after looking back, reality is often much more elegant and not the least crude or brute-forced-- electrical engineers reading this will know exactly what I'm talking about. . . as will many others. So, why then? If. . .\n\nThey are not conspiring against anyone. Then. . .\n\nWhat are they buying time for?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Absolutely nothing.** \n\n>Sorry to disappoint you. A crash is detrimental to them too; especially after the restrictions put on banks after the last financial crisis. The fed, the gov, the shitty graphs, QE,  and every single god damn revision they've made to their economic forecasts. All of it is done to prevent panic, relax expectations, and shank the natural crash that would've otherwise occurred before it could run. They’re doing their best to buy time and delay the downturn because that’s all that they can do. There doesn’t have to be a conspiracy theory. There doesn’t have to be brilliant reason. Sometimes the best explanation is the most obvious one.\n\nFed buying anything and everything? They’re trying to prevent certain firms, that are leveraged to the tits with junk, from blowing up and causing a chain reaction. In their view, that’s the best way for them to protect the financial system and serve the American people. However, It also happens to be the easy way out, the other path less traveled, despite being the obvious choice to the rest of us, is unknown, uncertain, and untested. It’s scary, and it should be; because it's never been done before. They’re human too, and it’s easier to make easy decisions as one (especially for a bunch of boomers).\n\n> ok Boomer. And yes, to answer the obvious, they won't be held accountable because when it's our turn to deal with this shit they'll suddenly pretend be senile. *Go figure.*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThen why did I say when we switched to these more drawn out forecasts it’d matter?\n\nBecause it happens to cancel the U-V shaped recovery story or the virus “magically” going away narrative currently being preached by the media. That’s the only reason why I cared about this current revision. It's big. That's it. There is going to be a relatively large base case shift or fundamental change because of it. I don’t think anybody should put in the mental effort to care about how firms make models and tweak them after they’re finished switching and started publishing their “revised” bullshit this time around. That or I just like being lazy and ignoring things I don’t think matter anymore or will soon become irrelevant. Either way, soon we can all forget about virus models/forecasts because they’ll only be a worthless distraction and serve as comedic relief soon.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHowever. Back to the current timeline. . .\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhy does matter is that if these new models are getting passed around internally?\n\nIt means they will soon go for public release in a week or so. And we'll have our promised downturn. I hate shitty graphs.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**The concluding discussion:**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBack to my favorite kind of speculation. \n\n>I over-explained graphs that didn’t mean anything in the first place. Then argued for a faulty statement. Kindof like yodeling in space. *Go figure.* \n\n>To balance things out I’m going to be concise about the next part which might be relevant.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThe assumption I’m making: **We won’t breach next fib level.** If we do and don’t get rejected immediately, please proceed to chuck everything I say here out the window. The market will have changed, and I will have had no idea what I’m talking about and we should start to seriously consider buying precious metals.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n* Last week's rally was driven by both fundamental/technical factors but due to the ferocity of the rally we have since diverged, *bigly.*\n* Notice Monday: money was flooding into strong stocks like Amazon/Netflix/AMD ect.. but shit stocks like Ford/Airlines/Lyft were getting sucked dry. It would appear that MMs are currently positioning for some sort of broader downturn as we continue to go sideways but sorta upwards in the meantime. \n* If you think of TA as Sin(), and Fundamental as Cos(), I believe they’re just about to close in on a point of maximum divergence soon.\n* What happens when they start converging again? idk. you tell me.\n* If you do TA yourself or follow any number of TA charters, one term that is currently being echoed is “beautiful TA” Why is it considered beautiful? Why are the charts suddenly so clean and elegant? Why were the magic crayons swapped out for an artisan's brush?\n* Stubborn traders that only look at the fundamentals and complain about the divergence have become blind to a real beauty passing by on the other side. They will continue to lose in the coming weeks.\n* Last week a wet towel was wrung out once, it is customary to wring a towel a 2nd time to get the remaining water out.\n* For this reason we are most likely going to follow the TA and complete the ascending wedge for the rest of this week at least. This channel will most likely finish somewhat close to the next fib level.\n* My base case is an eventual slow, and drawn-out downturn for reasons highlighted in the useless chunks before this section. *It will not be easy to profit off of.* Don’t be tricked: We may enter a downturn soon, but it will be one where Circuit-breakers will most likely be both sparse and scarce in between; likewise the same can be said about VIX spikes. We won’t be seeing a lot of them anytime soon until a crash  occurs in one of the credit-markets in a couple of months. Meanwhile, if they are doing everything in their power to delay whatever they’re trying to prevent, make no mistake, **it will be delayed.**\n* Prognosis for the next couple of weeks: Gay. 50 shades of it. The elevators are all broken but we might hop off some stairs a couple times; I still think it’s going to be a delayed/drawn-out downturn regardless-- simply because that’s what **they** are trying to do.\n* Try to daytrade. If you’re long gamma look for short trades. Be a bandit. *Be like water.* Any positions (excluding LEAPS) held for more than a week is going to end up going belly up. \n\n>**We're in a vast ocean, the ocean won't shed a tear when you lose all your investments. There is no such thing as easy money. Be safe in your trades and irl. GLHF**\n\nWith that being said, looking back I may sound like I'm against anyone betting on a big drop so i wanted to clarify:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf you see an opportunity for calls/puts, execute on your intuition. I don't intend to dissuade anyone from making money, but I implore you to have the time-frame in question well thought out ahead of time.
