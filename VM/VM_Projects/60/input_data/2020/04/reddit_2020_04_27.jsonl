{"title": "LOGI is about to smash their all-time high due to WFH and gaming", "selftext": "TLDR: LOGI 50c 5/15  Dont mind that its already near the Fortnite ATH again, its gonna crush that\n\nEveryone right now is working from home jerking off on company time.  Kids are playing games with their friends, and their parents are demanding they use headsets so they don't have to hear it. \n\nIf the parents didn't have a proper desk setup before, they do now, and either their company or they themselves bought keyboards, mice, and webcams to enable it.  If the kids didn't have a headset before, they do now, and once their Turdle Beach headset breaks, they are going to buy something with a bit more quality.\n\nNow, who makes all of this?  Logitech.  They are in a great position to capitalize on all fronts this quarter, and the evidence seems to show they have.\n\nLet's take a quick look through their website.  Here are their webcam offerings.  Ones I've crossed out are out of stock:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/iMBYKvD.png\n\nYeah, every single model is out of stock, even the $200 ones.  Bestbuy.com is sold out of all but the $170 model, Walmart.com has most in stock but at immense markups.\n\nNow, you may say, \"But you can get CHEAPSHIT brand peripherals from Amazon for only $10!\"  Yes, you can, but it seems Logitech as a brand name has immense pull.  Even the resale market for Logitech webcams is having a shortage.  For example, the C310, a long-discontinued model sold for less than $20 new and under $10 used on ebay back in February:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0okHo4J.png\nNow look at the sales from this week:\nhttps://i.imgur.com/RGjnPy3.png\n\nIf CHEAPSHIT brand truly were good enough, you wouldn't see used prices on decade old Logitech webcams increase this much.  People want their Logitech.\n\nBut what do Logitech's numbers say?  Let's take a look at their last quarterly report: https://i.imgur.com/Jxzu3I5.png\n\nLast quarter PC webcams were only 3.5% of their net sales with a YoY increase of just 3%, but video collaboration was 10% with an increase of 24% YoY.  Video collaboration products are their very expensive camera systems, but now with some offices returning partial workforces, both PC webcams and collaboration cameras will have a massive increase in sales to facilitate meetings.  Gaming makes up over 25% of their net, and we all know the spike gaming has seen.\n\nSo, in short, Logitech is gonna rocket off once their quarterly earnings are out on the 11th.

{"title": "US Economy in August 2019 vs April 2020 - a Comparison", "selftext": "On August 19, 2019 the US unemployment rate sat near a record low of 3.8%. Almost all industries were full steam ahead with investment. Carnival was building their largest ship to date, new US shale oil wells were coming online all over the country, and even GE looked like they were on the mend with their new CEO. The worst news in corporate America was around Boeing forgetting that they should train pilots when they design a new plane. Our president was in the news for saying things like we were going to buy Greenland but ultimately reassured the markets that recession fears were unfounded. That day the S&P 500 closed at 2847.11\n\nFast forward 9 months to April 27, 2020. The US unemployment rate is likely already higher than 20% and is in spitting distance of the record 24.9% that was set in 1933 during the great depression. A pandemic ravages our cities and the elderly, a pandemic caused by a germ we know so little about that our president suggested injecting bleach into our veins to treat it. The travel and entertainment industries sit in ruin as nearly all humans stopped traveling or leaving their house. Oil was priced at negative $40 and projections of June delivery have been forecasted as low as negative $100, the entire US oil industry is effectively bankrupt. Our basic food supply chains have been so taxed by the virus that shortages are projected to begin within two weeks. From a business perspective a near worst case scenario has occurred.\n\nIn response, bank's capital requirements have been cut to 0, The Fed has employed all emergency programs used during the great recession at faster speed and greater depth, and congress has passed unprecedented levels of aid. Despite these steps, it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that companies will fail, jobs will not return quickly, and we are now in the steepest recession in US history. What little forward looking guidance companies are willing to offer is all negative and even the rosiest analysis indicates negative worldwide GDP growth.
