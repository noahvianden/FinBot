{"title": "Will The Second Housing Crisis Will Be Brought To Light by COVID-19", "selftext": "I was looking into shorting Mr. Cooper because I've seen how this amount of unemployment compares with the past; thinking home owner lenders will be hurting. However along the way I found a few articles that could support a second housing crisis. I wrote about 3 possible parts I found that could spark a second housing crisis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPart 1\n\n‚ÄúFixing‚Äù the Crisis in 2008-2009\n\nDuring the bubble era of the housing crisis in 2008 people defaulted on their home loans. The lenders holding on to the MSR are responsible for the money the defaulter cannot pay. In order to make up some of the losses the banks issued a foreclosure on the home. In 2010 too many homes were available from foreclosures on the market and the prices of homes kept plummeting. Hope now Alliance was launched to combat the high rate of foreclosures. It was composed of lenders representing 60% of all outstanding mortgages in the United States. it provides to homeowners as loan workouts. These workouts can either result in establishing a modified repayment plan with the homeowner to bring them up to date.\n\nFor 2008 and 2009, Amherst Securities Group‚Äôs graph showed re-defaults ranging from 75-90%.¬† For the peak year of modifications 2010 it reported rates of 50-60%. In the following years re-default rate decreased to a more normal level.\n\nAccording to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), there are more than $800 billion of these bubble-era loans still outstanding as of the third quarter of 2018. ¬†\n\nIts clear not all the loans have not been repaid and they are hidden in the murkiness of the mortgage industry. \n\nPart 2 \n\nJUMBO LOANS\n\nRecently, several jumbo loan investors have increased the loan limits and expanded the lending criteria for non-QM loan programs, including higher allowed loan-to-value ratios.\n\n(For 2020, the Federal Housing Finance Agency raised the maximum conforming loan limit for a single-family property from $484,350 to $510,400.)\n\nJumbo mortgages have traditionally required a down payment of at least 20 percent, but some jumbo lenders are now only requiring 10 percent down or less, some online private lenders are now only require 5%.\n\nSeveral jumbo loan programs enable borrowers to qualify for financing just one or two years after a major credit event, such as a bankruptcy or foreclosure.\n\nPart 3 \n\nCash out Refis \n\nWhy these are dangerous\n\nInterest costs: enough said. \n\nRisk of foreclosure:¬†Many Americans without jobs have refinanced their homes and can no longer afford it. \n\nTake this example, there‚Äôs a small business shop and that family just refinanced on their home at 80% what its worth (the max) and put it toward their business, but then the shutdown forced them to close their doors. In many cases the homeowner has no income and will default on their new highly priced loan (possibly with new interest rates).\n\nAccording to Freddie Mac's refinance report Cash-out refis¬†originations¬†reached 23% by the end of 2018. The report notes that 82% of all refinances in the final quarter of 2018 were cash-outs refis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR: there's some murky things going down and I think the corona virus is going to take the blame for a possible housing crisis that was merely a repetition of the past.", "id": "fwes0s", "created_utc": 1586237310.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 60, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 51, "replies": [{"body": "My mortgage with escrow is 14.4% of my income.
