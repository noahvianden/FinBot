{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today, Wed, Sept 9. Please enjoy!", "selftext": "**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 9, 2020**\n\nStocks shot up today and recovered some losses after sharp declines in big tech stocks. After several red days, shares of Amazon (AAPL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big companies rallied. On a sour note, reopening stocks (travel, cruise lines, airlines, hotels, etc) were down after AstraZeneca (AZN) announced it had its COVID-19 vaccine trial paused.\n\nThe S&P finished 2.08% up, the Nasdaq was 2.92%, leading the day, and the Dow finished 1.68% up. The volatility index (VIX) was down 4.8%, indicating increased risk appetite in traders.\n\nToday, it was announced that AstraZeneca, a forerunner in the development of the COVID vaccine announced a pause of their experimental trial after one patient became more ill, pledging to make safety a priority and take the time necessary to let science prevail. This setback comes in stark contrast to politicians and governments who seem to imply a cure is just around the corner. Shares of AstraZeneca sank 2%, while those of companies competing to develop a Covid-19 vaccine including Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX) rose.\n\nUS oil prices plunged nearly 7% today, after Saudi Aramco, the largest oil producer in the world, announced it would be slashing its selling price to Asia and the United States, per Bloomberg. \"Oil demand globally is really sluggish. All of the low hanging fruit from the global oil recovery has already happened,\" said Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAsia-Us cargo rates are at the highest since March lows. For bulls evidence of a rebounding economy, for bears activity is fueled by liquidity and the shoe has yet to drop.\n\n**Highlights**\n\n* After falling nearly 20% in the week, Tesla (TSLA) stock roared back today, finishing the day 10.9% up.\n* Big Commerce (BIGC) reported earnings today. While estimates were beaten, investors were not impressed. Stock is down 10% today (4% during session (6% after-hour)\n   * EPS of -$0.38 v -$0.43 estimate\n   * Revenue of 36.3 million v 35.6 million estimate\n* Facebook (FB) underperformed the market, finishing a modest 0.94% up.\n* Precious metals were up today, with gold miners ($GDX) leading, up 4.34%. Silver was up 1.58% and gold was 0.92% up.\n* McConnell announced plans to unveil the new $300B relief bill and took procedural steps needed to set up a vote \"as soon as this week.\" Schumer and Pelosi said \"Republicans bill which doesn't come close to addressing the problems and is headed nowhere\"\n* Analyst Upgrades:\n   * $MSFT Microsoft had a nice boost by Morgan Stanley $MS who raised its price target from $230 to $245\n   * $PTON Peloton had Price Target raised by Wedbush from $66 to $100\n   * $RPD Rapid7 Target raised by $MS Morgan Stanley $55 to $60 (nice stock check it out)\n   * $SFIX Stich Fix initiated by Deutsche Bank at BUY with pt $34\n   * $SPCE Virgin Galactic Upgraded by Credit Suisse from $22 to $24 and NEUTRAL to OUTPERFORM.\n\nNotable Earnings for Tomorrow Thur Sept 10: FuelCell FCEL (BO), Chewy CHWY (AH), Dave & Busters PLAY (AH),  Oracle ORCL (AH), Peloton PTON (AH)\n\nInteresting recent CEO purchase transactions: MNLO $100k, CWH $3MM, VST $750k, BKR $1MM, FRG $4.5MM, IVZ $3MM, SDC $10MM, PLAG $1.7MM", "id": "ipp1dp", "created_utc": 1599685167.0, "score": 438, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 66, "comments": [{"body": "I lived in SF and as soon as SF went into lockdown, I bought a peloton.

This company makes foam furniture. **Why on earth has its stock price risen 1,000% this year?** How big is the addressable market for foam furniture? How high are the barriers to competitor's entry? Do \"investors\" think that it will start paying a dividend... for the next 30+ years?\n2. Nautilus, Inc. (NLS). This is a 40+ year old manufacturer of gym equipment. From what I can tell (see their web site), they make treadmills, stationary cycles and the like and have some sort of subscription model. Their earnings had been getting worse since 2016, even losing money last year. The business was shakey even when run by management who surely knew what it was doing for the past 4 decades. Yes COVID-19 means they'll sell more home gym equipment this year, but what then? I know what: people will continue to buy more and more commodity home gym equipment from Amazon or wherever. Yes, they now have subscription services. **Still, why on earth has its stock price risen 1,000% this year?** Did they figure out how to make gym equipment at zero marginal cost? What has changed that could possibly justify this price?

The climb goes lightly exponential over a fairly short time, the excitement gets out to the general public, the trend climbs much higher fast, then bigger players start taking profits, the stock lowers, individuals panic and sell seeing a downturn, which precipitates more selling, and we dive.  If you have a solid company with a serious gameplan then it probably recovers.  Mostly because the serious players buy back in at a discount.\n\nEssentially, I think technicals matter up until they don't haha.   Or, maybe, technicals don't matter until they do.\n\nBut I think there is a lot more reason to ignore PE for the companies with realistic growth plans that have solid lines of funding.
