{"title": "ZM and SNOW who is still buying?? ZM CEO just cashed in!", "selftext": "ZM and SNOW are trading at 100x+ revenue! REVENUE, not gross profits. ZM has a PE ratio of 622,meaning if they have weak growth from here, you could be stuck holding a bag for decades to get a 100% return from this price level. SNOW is burning investor money (negative PE ratio) and is back at its scandalously overvalued IPO price of $250 (buffet bought at $75). ZM is currently trading at 8x value from the start of the year and 2020 Y/Y revenue has increased only 1.9x. $500 is a nice round number, maybe I should buy some ZM puts?\n\nLow and behold, CEO yuan eric sold a whopping $69 million of ZM stock on 9/23 and 9/24 (reported on 9/25 after hours) and currently holds zero shares:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2349b12lpyp51.png?width=1055&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3ca189675372dd20b202e0df05c148bb9bf8e99\n\nLike holy crap, if I owned ZM I'd sell it all too at this price level. Who wants to work hard to grow a company when you can cash in and retire on a cool $69 million? MRNA had a similar situation and sold off 35% from 7/17 to 9/2. Huge bear signal. I bet ZM fully fills the gap to $325 within two months.\n\nWhy is 100x revenue a lot? NVDA is trading at 22x revenue and AAPL at 7x revenue, and both of these companies are blue chips that are more profitable and have, in my opinion, much better long term growth potential (AI revolution gonna be huge, AAPL and NVDA to the moon).\n\nAlso ZM isn't the only company that provides peer to peer voice call service. Did you know that MSFT owns skype? AAPL owns facetime, AMZN owns twitch, and many other companies compete with zoom.\n\nLastly, Trump announced live today near close that rapid corona virus test kits are rolling out soon, with results available in minutes, and the vaccine is on verge of phase 3 approval.
