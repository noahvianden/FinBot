Don't count on your puts printing yet, though. Oil is up after market, S&P is still strong after hours, and the daily MACD desperately wants to cross up: https://i.imgur.com/ijHnpe5.png\n\nOn top of that markets are probably expecting/waiting for the stimulus bill to pass and super fucking psyched that Trump wants to sacrifice the olds for better stock market gains. That might provide a short term boost but we all know we should be gearing up for the next great depression.\n\nWe have other supporting aspects like Saturn quint Moon, Mars quint Moon, Jupiter quint Sun throughout the day and Chiron conjunct Sun and Node closing in on nonile to Jupiter. All SUPER supportive, optimistic, aggressive shit: https://i.imgur.com/a8EWDEA.png\n\nAlso, if you were surprised by the Fed's announcement yesterday and the pump today, fucking why? Today there was a new Moon in Aries right on top of Chiron with Saturn entering Aquarius (extremely optimistic) on MONDAY, along with Mars (initiative) crossing Pluto (control, money, power) and Jupiter (limitlessness, expansion, exuberance) in 8 CARDINAL SIGNS resulting in what? INFINITE MONEY PRINTING BY THE FUCKING FED: https://i.imgur.com/4hJbJ9d.png\n\nGranted, worse numbers will probably mute that a bit so I expect tomorrow to be green-ISH, SPY opening within 5 points of close and probably peeking over the edge, perhaps with a bigger smash if the stimulus bill finally passes, but then we slope back down for more red days. However. Nothing SUPER interesting, until April 1-4. Then the shit REALLY hits the fan with, uh, something (economic systemic collapse? war? idk), correlating with Mars/Saturn conjunction (aggression towards/from systems, control, governments, rulers) Jupiter/Pluto conjunction (explosion of survival requirements, unending hunger, desperation) AND Mercury/Neptune conjunction (idk): https://i.imgur.com/NvLC6JK.png\n\nIf I were y'all, I'd STRADDLE because it's unclear where exactly the price will land but we know it's gonna be VOLATILE AS FUCK. I straddled today at 240 and it was making money going both ways because the calls are going up and getting more valuable but the premium for puts are STILL increasing because people know this is going to crash. However, by the time we peak out, there might be some optimism before the big drop, and you can get SPY puts cheaper there with the money you just made off your straddle. If you're holding SPY puts, you can buy the same number of shares as you have contracts to essentially lock your loss and keep it from going up on down days (and you can day trade a little to make up the difference by selling your stock during dips). Good luck.\n\nPositions as point: https://i.imgur.com/lH9A4tA.png (I know I know, I don't YOLO, but that's because I believe in reincarnation)", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "Fucking Jupiter quint sun.
