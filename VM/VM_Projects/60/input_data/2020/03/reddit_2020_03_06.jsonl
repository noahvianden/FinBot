{"title": "The case for SPY 157", "selftext": "In my last post here I showed you guys one of the ways you can effectively yolo.   \n [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/djhobg/how\\_to\\_efficiently\\_yolo\\_retarded\\_nonretarded/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/djhobg/how_to_efficiently_yolo_retarded_nonretarded/) \n\nIn this post, I will make the bearish case for SPY 157. There are two big reasons why SPY might go back down to 157, So lets get started.\n\n1. Both the recessions that took place in 2000 (dot com) and 2008 (housing) crisis have something in common. They both started to decline after hitting 157.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[A graph showing SPY from 1999 to 2015. Notice that in both recessions market hit 157.](https://preview.redd.it/x4fszvffj2l41.png?width=1426&format=png&auto=webp&s=5776be601168dc40d879f067da104110220b7639)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Another chart of SPY showing a more zoomed out view.

In both the 2000 and 2008 recessions, the market declined by approximately 50% and 54% respectively from its peak. Well, guess what is 50%-54% of the current high? Yes, its the region around 157\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Monthly Chart showing SPY, and how the 50-54&#37; moves line up with 157 area](https://preview.redd.it/4lrv005cm2l41.png?width=1163&format=png&auto=webp&s=4869aee346b3a7b39c2a5f077724a48cda30fa5d)\n\nNow, how likely is this situation? Nothing is confirmed until SPY makes a close below this 11 year trend line its been following.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Overall look of Monthly SPY chart.](https://preview.redd.it/i85f1fyon2l41.png?width=1397&format=png&auto=webp&s=68f569274dd3b47bf6e5ef0469e3089ca4f9020b)\n\nAt the time of writing, this would be if SPY CLOSES below 270 this month.\n\nI'm not claiming this will happen, just trying to show you what a recession could look like.

I include myself in this; however, these are the  assumptions I'm running with and agree with you concerning the 1,570 strike price.\n\nHere below is my reasoning... which is heavily tied to Corona, but I'm well into agreeing that you're correct.\n\n1. 50+  demographic will have at least a 40% infection rate and 2% fatality for  the first round of Corona.  Subsequent rounds later in 2020 and early  2021 will reduce both numbers by 90% but not be forgotten in corporate  planning regarding productivity decreases.\n2. Fear  of dying by boomers will liquidate many of their positions in May /  June.  I've calculated out a peak death table for the US and other  countries once they've posted at least 5 statistically significant death  days.  This gives a run rate for fatalities and then using total  mortality against the growth rate for deaths you can find the inflection  point for when things get better.\n3. Bereavement  productivity issues will be astoundingly impactful from April - June.   Not included in my models but it helps me to hedge that things will get  much worse.\n4. The  peaks to the 2001 recession and 2008 recession were around 1,500 before  dropping to 800 and 700 respectively.  It seems reasonable given  business growth that 1,500 is a safe floor for the S&P500 given it  was the ceiling for the last two recessions.  \\*(Pitch random logic  spitball at me here.)\n5. Supply  chains will have to become more geographically diverse to avoid  material and product lock downs.  India keeping pharmaceuticals in  country is likely to drive this change in corporate behavior and require  regional product manufacturing.\n6. Sick  days will again in the US be utilized and respected.  This change will  have a minor but critical alteration in the total productivity numbers  as it will not be acceptable to show up to work with a minor cough or  fever for the foreseeable future.  This also holds true for employees  watching their children.\n7. In  the US we are going to have massive layoffs due to decreased demand.   Probably not 2008 levels of layoffs, but that's because there will be a  bit of offset from those dying from Corona.", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Need more colors on the chart", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "what is this fortune cookie shit", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I came to the same and dow around 18000 at the least.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "By may or June", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "At this rate it could be next Friday lol.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "If we get a crash, yes.
