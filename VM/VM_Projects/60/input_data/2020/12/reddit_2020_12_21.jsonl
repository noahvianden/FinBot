No one else was able to get such a deal. Apple used that subsidy system until the carriers finally had enough as they ran out of non-iPhone users to spread the cost out over. Apple tried to price-fix with ebooks which they got in trouble with. They charged a 30% commission for in-app subscriptions for services (e.g. Music) that they directly compete with.\n\nIt is consistent that Apple has attempted when they can to control the market as that way you can gain market share much easier then actually trying to compete. Not saying the iPhone is not a great product, but it is clear they benefitted a lot in growing that market share via how they were able to control the market.\n\nThis is why I suggest they would look to replicate that with autos as it is much more profitable and easier than actually competing directly.\n\nI saw some reports said they had some battery structure that would be groundbreaking and so on. But consider, Tesla laid out a manufacturing approach that seems to make sense that will have them building more batteries and cars for cheaper than anyone else. Maybe Apple's battery structure might technically be \"better\", but if you can't build it affordably then you can't compete. Frankly, I don't see how Apple goes about doing this without trying to manipulate the market itself some way to get a leg up. On the other hand, Tim Cook is not Steve Jobs, so while I can see Tim Cook continuing what Steve Jobs did, not sure I see him replicating it with cars. Tim Cook's might be great to run a company, but to build something new, I would take an Elon Musk any day over a Tim Cook.

{"title": "SGMO- Investment Thesis- Full DD", "selftext": " \n\n* **Wtf is SGMO?** It‚Äôs the most drastically undervalued gene therapy company on the market. They edit genes with zinc finger nucleases, a technology distinctly different from crispr.\n* **Zinc Finger?** It‚Äôs theoretically better than crispr. More specificity and less off-target edits than crispr, but years of reading investor village posts and the occasional research paper aren‚Äôt easily summarized. And how it works doesn‚Äôt really change the thesis here.\n* **Why is it undervalued?** Check out the market cap and past year‚Äôs price action of the competitors in the field\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Ticker|Market Cap|\n|:-|:-|\n|BMRN|16 B|\n|CRSP|10.5 B|\n|ONCE|Acquired for 4 B|\n|EDIT|4 B|\n|NTLA|3 B|\n|SGMO|2 B|\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* **Why is BMRN on there?** Because Biomarin is SGMO‚Äôs largest competitor for Hemophilia A gene therapy, which also happens to SGMO‚Äôs closest to market product. But, surprise, SGMO has better data than BMRN! This year they reported higher sustained clotting factor levels and no bleeds within the first 52 weeks for the highest dose level of SB-525. Biomarin‚Äôs patients are having bleeds and requiring factor, and because of it (and the much better data from SGMO) BMRN got a rejection from the FDA when they tried to get accelerated approval to beat SGMO to market: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-biomarin-pharma-fda/u-s-fda-rejects-biomarin-hemophilia-a-gene-therapy-shares-dive-idUSKCN25F1H6](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-biomarin-pharma-fda/u-s-fda-rejects-biomarin-hemophilia-a-gene-therapy-shares-dive-idUSKCN25F1H6) BTW, the SGMO Hemophilia A gene therapy program is also partnered with \\*Pfizer\\*\n* **Partnered with Pfizer?** **Yeah, and Takeda. And Kite therapeutics. And Novartis. And Sanofi. And Biogen.** I‚Äôm retarded, but highly doubt those 5 big pharma partners and their entire team of scientists and capital allocation programs are as retarded as me. Look at the pipeline page: [https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline](https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline) And just for good measure, the Biogen/SGMO collaboration also included Biogen acquiring so much SGMO stock that Biogen owns like 17% of the damn company!!!! Acquisition rumors abound‚Ä¶and if you look at the table above most of those other names don't have anywhere near the number of partnerships/pipeline programs SGMO has.\n* **Biogen partnership is for multiple neurological diseases, including Alzheimer‚Äôs, the single largest unmet need in medicine today.** And Biogen didn‚Äôt fuck around with crispr for it.\n* **Speaking of pipeline, I hope you clicked on the link to the pipeline page.** Aside from the Phase 3 trial with Pfizer, they have four Phase 1 or 2 trials, and 13 disclosed preclinical trials. And 7 wholly-owned (not partnered) programs. And an estimated 600-700 million cash runway, with the expenses for the phase 3 program with Pfizer covered by Pfizer, and a potential reimbursement of a few hundred thousand to $1 million plus per patient (still cheaper than replacement factor infusion therapy).\n* **Why isn‚Äôt this worth more?** I dunno, but I can guess. CRSPR was featured on Radiolab and had some articles written about it a few years ago, and has had enough press that most people have heard of it in passing. SGMO also had some false starts, once a long time ago when they were basically a different company trying to tackle some bullshit like diabetic neuropathy. Another time when they were trying to do gene editing in live patients for MPS II (the CHAMPIONS ¬Ω trial) that didn‚Äôt have great results. Yes, they are trying to edit genes in live humans. Turns out it‚Äôs hard. And yes, it worked via detection of targeted integration via liver biopsy, but had not edit enough cells to be clinically significant (they‚Äôre still working on it).\n* **What else are they working on?** T-cell therapies, which can address anything from transplant rejection (their wholly-owned TX200 trial) to autoimmune diseases (IBD, also wholly owned). They bought the company TX Cell for 84 million in 2018 for this purpose.\n* **So why the hell are you telling me about this now?** Last couple weeks have been weird and SGMO has been taking off. Look at the last year specifically this month- it fucking rocketed off, pulled back, and has started to climb again. Price action on this stock has always been super wonky. If you follow it as close as I do, you‚Äôd notice the huge price spike happened \\*after\\* they reported the positive Hemophilia A data at ASH Dec 7th- the price spiked Dec 10th.\n* **Anything else going to make the price rocket up?** Aside from the fact that every gene therapy company chart has been a goddamn hockey stick this year, here‚Äôs some events: [https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=152550&pt=msg&mid=21430904](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=152550&pt=msg&mid=21430904)\n* **Also, its not in the ARKG gene therapy fund yet**, but theres a good chance Cathie Wood might shift profits from other names to SGMO #1 to diversify and #2 because it‚Äôs comparatively cheap as shit.\n* **Speaking of price, HCW just gave it a $25 price target.** Truist gave it price target $23. Some badass analyst with huge nuts had it at $36. The average is like $21. Mine personally is $25 this year and $45 long term. Here‚Äôs some undiagnosed autist on IV making a case: [https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=152920&pt=msg&mid=21447148](https://www.investorvillage.com/smbd.asp?mb=1933&mn=152920&pt=msg&mid=21447148)\n* **Yeah but do you own any, you kooky fuck with a wizard avatar?** Yeah, I have 2500+ shares, 25+ ITM calls, and 40+ OTM calls across all my accounts. I attached a screenshot from my traditional IRA. It‚Äôs most of my tradeable retirement. Not sure if this counts as YOLO? I feel like I‚Äôm wearing a life helmet at this point having held and accumulated this shit for 3+ years and finally seeing it take off.\n* **Thesis summary; SGMO is undervalued.** They have superior gene editing technology and a shit ton of shots on target in their huge pipeline with 5 big pharma partners, and they are getting close to hemophilia A gene therapy being commercialized in early 2022. Even if they completely fuck up more than half their pipeline they‚Äôre still undervalued.\n* **TLDR; why to invest in SGMO:** [https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline](https://www.sangamo.com/pipeline)\n* **TLDR; Buy SGMO now.**      LEAPs > short term, this stock trades weird and I don‚Äôt know how soon      it will rocket off, but started to launch a couple weeks ago. **Shares      are still cheap.** Don‚Äôt buy calls too far OTM in case of buyout. **May      and August calls in the $17-$20 range seem cheap. Jan‚Äô22 $20 strike looks      good to me, or Jan‚Äô23 $25 strike. $20 conservative price target by      year-end 2021.
