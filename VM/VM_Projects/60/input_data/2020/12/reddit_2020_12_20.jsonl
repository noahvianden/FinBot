Most companies with these instant offers are just trying to be disruptive to the real estate brokers. They are achieving some small market penetrations throughout various markets across the country. But most of the “customers” say, “hey this isn’t as good of a deal as just hiring an agent”. So companies like Zillow and others are saying you are right, let us get you with an agent. So now what they’ve realized is they just created a better way to get listing leads. That’s why Zillow is starting to become a “brokerage” actually representing buyers and sellers in many markets.

This is how they make money. The benefit they have is low contractor fees through volume. So they’ll buy a house, do the renovations that have an ROI for cheap and then turn around and sell. They give you an offer that is compared against using a realtor to justify the low price, then only have to pay the buyers agent commissions (if applicable) when selling. Plus they can justify the low price by offloading any stress involved in the selling process. \n\nWe bought a rental house from open door. They did a surprising number of updates (paint, granite counters, bathroom vanity, carpet, painted cabinets in kitchen), but did them very cheaply and it showed after 3 years of renting.
