These should be index fund etfs that are well diversified. Some that come to mind are VOO/SPY that tracks the S&P 500, VGK for European markets or EWG for Germany. Once you have some accumulated keep adding to them whilst trying your hand at stock picking. Do try to limit it relative to your entire portfolio.\n\nSome extra conservative investors would recommend not stock pick at all and just keep to etfs, but that is sometimes unrealistic. Etfs give you returns that markets average, which is great and beats most retail and professional investors in the long run. But should you want to get above average returns you would still have to gamble a bit. Just know that stock picking has larger risks alongside its potential larger rewards, and to always do your due diligence before entering into a position.\n\nLastly to answer the time period of investing, the simple answer is to hold good investments forever. So keep revisting the companies you have invest in periodically to see if they are still doing well.

It makes sense to use carbon fiber for prototypes (much faster and cheaper than developing tooling to stamp parts for just two prototypes), but as was pointed out, carbon fiber is much more expensive than stamped metal, so if they plan to manufacture a lot, metal could be more attractive (Sandy Munro has also discussed volume thresholds for using various manufacturing methods). As also discussed, some parts of the Semi have very deep curves, which could be difficult to stamp.
