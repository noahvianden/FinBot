{"title": "Walmart Is The Future", "selftext": "🚀📈Walmart Is The Future📈🚀\n\nBuy Walmart!\nTrust me, You don’t want to miss out\n\n\nOverall:\nWalmart’s new online Walmart plus service is very enticing and costs little to run compared to Amazon. They could become the future Amazon if the amount of people with Walmart Plus continues to grow. They should make a lot of money online during the Christmas season and pandemic and you should expect very high earnings going forward.\n\nWalmart is making a push into the pharmaceutical sector, investing money into the space. They also announced a healthcare/ health insurance \nprogram recently. Health is an area of huge potential due to the Pandemic causing focus on the health sector.\n\nWalmart is the largest retail store but was not affected to badly by the pandemic. Since they are the largest retail store you can except the stock to rise after the current restrictions on retail stores are lifted without having to worry about it falling with bad pandemic news.\n\nWalmart is:\n- A new online retailer with huge potential \n\n- Growing in the healthcare and Pharmaceutical industries\n\n-Set up to make money distributing COVID vaccines\n\n- The largest physical retail company in the world. (Physical retail is a sector that goes up a lot with good pandemic news)\n\nThese types of stocks are all stocks that people look at to find huge potential in growth. Walmart is really innovating and putting themselves in a position to grow a lot as a company over the next few years. There’s a chance that they will become the world largest online retailer and worlds largest Pharmacy along with them being the worlds largest physical retail company. That might seem ridiculous but it is entirely possible. If you think this is bullshit I encourage you to read the three news articles below and my in depth analysis of the stock.\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to read (references and today’s news):\n\n1. \n[Understanding Walmart Plus](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joannasciarrino/2020/09/15/walmart-plus-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-new-walmart-delivery-service/?sh=2acacc8b1085)\n\n[Today’s Walmart Plus News](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/walmart-plus-shipping-minimum-holidays-2020-12-1029855902)\n\n\n2.\n[Walmart Pharmacy New EVP And Plan](https://www.grocerydive.com/news/walmart-names-evp-of-health-and-wellness/591437/)\n\n[Walmart Opening Pharmacies](https://www.fool.com/millionacres/real-estate-investing/articles/walmart-to-open-health-superstores-what-it-means-for-real-estate-investors/)\n\n\n\nMy Findings:\n\n1. \nWalmart is really pushing their new online store service Walmart Plus. Walmart Plus is like Amazon prime except Walmart Plus offers same day or next day shipping for free on any purchase and same day free grocery delivery. They are one of the only companies in the world that can do this because of their nationwide retail stores. Walmart retail stores near almost every town which allows for the faster delivery than Amazon. This faster delivery will entice people to join Walmart plus and gives them an advantage over Amazon. Faster delivery allows for them to ship perishable goods like groceries because they will stay fresh during the same day shipping. Walmart also can keep costs at a minimum for the service. Unlike Amazon they do not need to pay for huge warehouses and warehouse employees because they have many stores already established. Amazon also has to ship your products across the country first in a semi truck to a warehouse, then from the warehouse onto a separate delivery truck that goes to your house. Amazon has to pay Warehouse costs which include property taxes, upkeep, and the huge initial cost to open a warehouse. They also have to pay employees at the warehouses. They also have to pay for semi trucks, last mile delivery vans and the salaries of the employees driving them (or pay for a service like UPS).\nKeep in mind Amazon has become one of the largest companies in the world. Walmart offers faster delivery while avoiding the fees for warehouses (they use their stores instead). They also have much lower costs on delivery. (They ship your products straight from your local Walmart to your house). If Amazon has become one of the top 5 companies in the world imagine the money Walmart will make by offering a similar service with faster deliveries with much less operating cost. With the bump in online sales during the Christmas season, and people turning to online shopping, Walmart can expect to gain a lot of new users on its new Walmart Plus service. This makes Walmart a strong growth tech stock that could become the next Amazon.\n\n2. Walmart is making big moves in the pharmaceutical space. They are opening more pharmacies and putting money into their pharmaceutical programs Walmart announced a new Health and Wellness EVP Dr. Cheryl Pegus, the former Chief medical officer of Walgreens. They should be able to make easy money with covid vaccine distribution and start making more in the pharmaceutical space overall. They are looking to take over CVS as the largest pharmacy In America. (They are currently the second largest) Walmart also started a healthcare program looking to capitalize on the health insurance market and take some of the market from companies like blue cross. They are looking to combine their new ventures into health with Walmart Plus and roll out a program to deliver perceptions to your home. There are rumors Walmart could even be able to deliver covid vaccines to homes once they are available. Take that with a grain of salt as it has not yet been confirmed by Walmart.\n\n\n3. Walmart is the worlds largest retail chain. You would think that that they should have taken a huge hit with the pandemic like most other retail stores. They did not however and actually reported a 6% average grown in overall sales at retail stores. This is due to Walmart being an essential business because they sell groceries and other essential items. People still shopped at Walmart even with the pandemic going on which makes them a very stable stock. Just because they didn’t go down with covid does not mean they won’t go up when it goes away.

Only a couple of months ago did I start looking into these new, interesting stocks and started selling puts on them\n\nOh my! What a success! 50% up in November alone! Sure I can not only replicate this, but *get in deeper and push my maintenance margin to its limit*, correct?\n\nSo yeah, I sold a lot of puts on $JMIA, $PLTR, $NIO, $WKHS, $HYLN you name it.

Not really *wiped wiped* since I did keep a (healthier) 10% profit from what I got in November.\n\nSo I get the learnings I get from this that will surely go into my trading diary are\n\n1) Don't necessarily forget about meme stocks, but approach them with extreme caution, as one would a hungry and maltreated puppy. There is indeed money to be made there, but timing and sizing is everything if you want to keep your wits. Trade small, get out and reevaluate often, keep an eye on the general picture and don't ignore the warnings and only pay heed to the \"to the moon\"ers.\n\n2) Pushing the maintenance margin was likely the stupidest thing I could have done. Even if I did believe in a prompt rebound (I don't), I didn't have time -- I would have been liquidated today at close, or even earlier.\n\n3) Diversify, diversify, diversify. Most of the punching I got were from overpriced EV stocks.\n\n4) All the above having been said, DON'T PANIC! I knew yesterday already that I was down for a pounding today, and the UPS news on $WKHS just made it way worse. I knew I had to exit positions today. But DON'T PANIC EXIT AT MARKET OPEN! If I had done that I would have been crushed by the volatility and the 10% I kept would have easily been a 15% loss overall.
