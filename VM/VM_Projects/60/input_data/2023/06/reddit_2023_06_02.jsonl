It was getting a lot of shit at the time, and Zuck is far from wrong on VR. He's doing some ballsy shit with it. It's just that Horizons is a steaming pile of shit. the Quest and its ecosystem, is not. They are sitting on a goldmine with that and are effectively in a position that Valve software was in back in 2004. If Valve software was a public company in the early 2000s, people would have been betting hard against it  and steam. Steam was seen as garbage and an unmitigated disaster.\n\nInstead it made them ungodly amounts of money. SteamVR exists, and is one of the most important aspects of PCVR, however, portable, PC free VR? Quest wins, hands down, and it's its own ecosystem. A LOT of younger people do not even have PCs at home. They exist almost entirely on consoles and mobile. The Quest is yet another console for them, and they like VR. The people who do not understand that are people who arent the target demographic Meta is taking aim at.\n\n1. Facebook and instagram are still used by a majority of people over the age of 25. Just because tiktok is popular right now among teens and young adults, doesn't mean facebook and instagram are dead, in fact a lot of people outside the western world still use it as their \"internet\" It's practically a money printer for Zuck.\n2. Zuckerberg is taking aim at the next generation of gaming and gamers. VR is a gimmick, but it's one that has become recently far more affordable. You can buy a fully functional headset for less than a PS5 or Xbox. The only thing comparable in price is a nintendo switch for what is effectively a more immersive experience. We're talking kids who are 13-17 years old right now getting hooked into VR. The end goal is to get those kids hooked in, and in 5 years they're 18-22 year olds who are now buying more games, and some of them are making games for VR or content for existing VR platforms. It's a growing market as we speak. He's begrudgingly a big part of an emerging industry.\n\nMeta is not going anywhere any time soon and my biggest regret was not dumping cash in it when I knew better.\n\nSell the hype, buy the bad news. If fundamentals are still strong and not just some cope, it's a buy.\nThat being said I would not touch nvidia right now because the time to buy passed, all you can do is watch the bastards who invested when it was lower get rich.\n\nIf facebook was myspace status, then yes, YOLOing at 90 would be a fully regarded move. But it isnt.\n\nThere's a lot going on, and meta has been working to evolve past being an ad company with a social network attached. They have a lot of inertia, a lot of mindshare, and have other projects cooking that may prove immensely profitable in coming years. \n\nIf you're a bear, then you will just see \"Zuckerberg is dumb! VR is dumb because I dont care about it! tiktok is taking over social media, lol zuck the cuck, meta to 0!\" and bet against it because it sounds like a good play. I wouldnt bet against Zuckerberg. I was an idiot who was cheering for meta to collapse because I hate the man, but realized late last year the fucker actually has a plan, though his boss baby avatar and horizons was a mistake.

{"title": "WHY jobs +339K yet unemployment increased to 3.7% + Fed + Market", "selftext": "There are 3 surveys:\n\n1. Household Survey (Unemployment rate)\n2. Establishment Survey (Non-farm payrolls)\n3. Household Survey Research Series.\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/ces\\_cps\\_trends.htm](https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/ces_cps_trends.htm)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s7ktzvfgmm3b1.png?width=1240&format=png&auto=webp&s=60beb84c9f78ce9b4902024efa3e509e184e4f4b\n\nThe Household Survey surveys people directly. Establishment surveys companies. The issue is the Household survey includes:\n\n1. Agricultural jobs\n2. People who have multiple salary jobs (ie 2 full time paying jobs)\n\nThe issue is the NFP (the 339K new jobs) is NON-FARM ie you must REMOVE agricultural jobs. The research series REMOVES agricultural job holders from the Household Survey. Then there are multiple job holders with multiple salaries. Remove them as well. So we get 3 numbers:\n\n1. Household Survey = **MINUS** 310,000 jobs\n2. Establishment Survey = **PLUS** 339,000 jobs\n3. Household Survey Research Series = **PLUS** 394,000 jobs.\n\nThis means that there is a LARGE gap of (394,000 + 310,000 =) 704,000 jobs that were part of the agricultural + multiple salary holders group. So the following would need to happen:\n\n1. Agricultural jobs was massively reduced.\n2. Multiple salary holders would need to decrease.\n\nWe then go to the handy FRED [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS12034560](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS12034560):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vd6ittpmm3b1.png?width=1323&format=png&auto=webp&s=608727ba4db4f3ef1621a3d18da4d6672a016ad0\n\nWe can see the # of new agricultural jobs is PLUS ZERO!!! This means that (2) Multiple salary job holders got reduced by a **WHOPPING 704,000**!!!!\n\n**This indicates most likely higher income people with multiple jobs are getting laid off from their 2nd or 3rd of 4th jobs, and can only retain fewer jobs.**\n\nThe unemployment rate sadly is calculated using the household survey, but technically should use the Research Series, which removes agricultural jobs and multiple job holders. A better approach is to just create an unemployment rate which keeps agricultural jobs, but removes multiple job holders.\n\n# Birth Deaths issue\n\nThere are some explanations out there on the birth deaths issue of +231,000 from the BLS. Ie people are saying the birth deaths model is randomnly adding 231,000 extra new jobs into the NFP number.\n\nWhat is the birth deaths model? This is not population births and deaths, but COMPANY births and deaths. New companies come into the market, but there is a lag of a few months until they start reporting in the NFP survey. So, the BLS takes this lag into account, and adjusts the NFP number.\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesbd.htm](https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cesbd.htm)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lisijgksnm3b1.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&s=37fc85c9fef3ad15d062a9ef4d4c310a369d8b1f\n\nPeople are saying the 339K is FAKE, and 231K is just part of the birth deaths model. But that's an overcharged explanation, since every May, interestingly ALWAYS we get a lot of births of new companies..... See last year 2022 May:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8n614k3jom3b1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=2eded1ab1a1220b6d6a47f58e6f46fd17fc0f35f\n\nPlus the birth death model is NOT SEASONALLY ADJUSTED................. This means the number will most likely get removed by seasonal adjustments. Not the unemployment rate AND NFP are both seasonally adjusted.\n\n# Other points\n\nSadly the black unemployment rate jumped quite dramatically from 4.7% to 5.6%.

This also means there is a gap of 130,000 people which essentially is the new entrants from BLS's population model. So somehow we need to explain the 310,000 lost jobs.\n\n1. 16 to 19 youth employment: 120,000 lost their jobs in May, yet only 64,000 are now unemployed. This indicates 50% of them are NOT working for economic reasons, but working for experience. Generally if families are poorer, all 120,000 teenagers will be unemployed, yet only 50% are. Not sure how this factors in the Summer Break.\n2. 310,000 - 120,000 = 190,000 left to account for. Over 25s with only high school employed went UP by 255,000. Over 25s with some college employed went DOWN by 377,000, yet unemployed went up by only 100,000. This indicates over 277,000 (74%) of those who lost their job are not looking for a job yet, meaning their finances are fine for now.\n3. Self employed workers went DOWN by 369,000. The issue is this was not broken down into industries.\n4. Part time did go down by around 164,000 for those who must have a PT job to make ends meet, yet those who are having a PT job for extra cash ROSE by 70,000.\n5.

Professional service jobs (lawyers, doctors, engineers) FELL YoY to 2% from 4.14%.\n\nAll in all, I can't explain why it's the higher income bracket - the data seems to suggest it.
