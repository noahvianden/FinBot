{"title": "TSLA: Cybertruck’s About to Nuke Boomer Auto", "selftext": "Alright degens I've been crunching some numbers that are gonna make you twitch. People say the Cybertruck is a joke, but I think those smooth-brains have a huge blind spot. Just back in March [Morgan Stanley shat on](https://insideevs.com/news/656606/morgan-stanley-cybertruck-low-volume-prediction/) the truck, predicting just 50k deliveries PER YEAR.\n\nI'll keep it short but let's talk about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/67wh9l3twm7b1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=73dc7d836f45a4065af39ab19791014beec5211f\n\nThe Cybertruck has 1.5 million reservations already, and Google Trends data suggests that it could go as mainstream as the Model Y. When Elon tweeted about the Cybertruck in April, the internet broke with searches for it. And guess where these searches came from? Truck-loving areas. Places where all the dudes drive F150s and Silverados. They're flirting.\n\nWe all know how boomers in the auto industry like Ford and Chevy milk profits from gas-guzzling trucks to fund their garbage EV projects. But what if Musk and his Cybertruck come in across middle America like a wrecking ball? Cash cow slaughtered. Margins decimated.\n\nI smell blood, and I think you do too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/grulj39uwm7b1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b59bb746c62ca30fbdc6bdce2460f0e7026fcd9\n\nRemember back in 2014, when everyone laughed at the idea of EVs? The US Energy Information Administration predicted them to have a tiny market share by 2040. Well, EVs hit 5% of the US market share last year, and the projection has been increased each year. Now, they're saying it'll be like 14% by 2040. They're worse at predictions than JPow and the fed are about inflation.\n\nEven with that lowball number, Tesla’s got a path for 70%+ global EV market share. That’s like 8 million cars per year, up from 1.3m last year.\n\nNow, some pencil-pushers are saying trucks will make up 69% of all vehicles in the US by 2040, but EV trucks will only grab a measly 10% of that. Here's what I say to them: 🖕\n\nThese analysts might be scared of forecasting exponential EV growth, but I think it's about damn time they woke up and smelled the electric engine fires. The Cybertruck will be a nightmare for traditional automakers.\n\nSo this might be a good time to bump up your TSLA exposure. This is not financial advice, but those Cybertruck numbers should blow whiny analysts’ expectations out of the water.\n\ntl;dr: Cybertruck is gonna go mainstream, disrupting traditional automakers and sending EV growth to the moon. Hold onto your seats, apes. Watch those Cybertrucks fly off the shelves and print tendies with me through 2024.\n\nPosition: Long $TSLA.

This is because of outliers - disabled at a younger age who spend 30 years in skilled care. Anything less than skilled care (eg assisted living) is basically a high rent payment. \nCost for skilled care is about $8K per month (Medicaid rate). Subtract social security (because this person has no other expenses as they vegetate in the facility) it’s about net $6K. (Really wealthy people pay a lot more, but it doesn’t impact them.) One year is 72K, four is 280K. Typical stay I have seen is a little over a year, though I had two clients last a whole lot longer. One had LTC payments, so she was actually increasing her net worth the whole time, like 6 years. The other bought into a community, so her net worth likewise continued to increase over the 12 years she needed care (she was 102 when she passed). So it is actually manageable for those with 1MM+ saved, and totally unmanageable for those with like 100K saved (they go on Medicaid after spending down). \n\nYes, it happens, though it does not cause any serious issue for folks with assets. They self-pay, and it affects them far less because they stop spending on everything else. The kids get a little grumpy sometimes, particularly when the mom/dad is in the 100K-200K range of assets (the level getting wiped out). But 200K is nothing anyway, particularly when divided among the kids. \n\nThe Medicaid patients typically did not have much initially, and there are some viable strategies to preserve a modest home when skilled care becomes necessary.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "STFU ASSHOLE", "score": -5, "replies": []}]}, {"body": ">The market will always find a way to correct itself.

It is an old, stagnant, complacent company that still thinks of itself as corporate loyalty but feels more like a retirement home. It is LADEN with nepotism.

The facilities of their golden egg - the organic synthesis group - are ancient. People and equipment basically unchanged since the 80s. The employees that aren't nepobabies just don't care.
