They were not designed to be used as investing or betting instruments. Now, retail has popularized and repurposed them as quick-win instruments, or go-big-or-bust. However, humans are terrible - absolutely terrible - at judging risk, and therefore they almost all inevitably lose their shirts.\n\nIf you happen to read the booklet your broker gives you when you sign up for options trading they explicitly tell you that 85% of option traders lose capital in the first year. This tells you that it's not randomness. It's by design against use as an investing instrument. In essence, the premiums paid for options are calculated so that only extraordinary price moves result to profits (hence the hedging purpose).
