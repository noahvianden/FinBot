There is the AI hype and that train is still chugging along. It'll take awhile until the hype dies out. Just like in 2021, when Crypto had it's hype train it went from FEB 2021 all the way to OCT 2021 before starting to let go of it's steam. I suspect the same to happen with this AI train. \n\nAI is definitely going to be revolutionary don't get me wrong, but it's years away from mass market deployment. All of this \"pricing in\" will go ahead, but once it reaches a peak it'll start falling down (Look at TSLA's pricing in went up to 500+ now it's back to 160-170's). So for now it's best to just sit on the sideline and watch it go up, sure you can join the wagon, but you have to remember a few things before yolo'ing into it:\n\n1. **Debt Ceiling:** Look we all know it's going to be raised... Eventually, but there's going to be drama around it and will go to the last hour. So I won't trade around that volatility, you'd be easily IV crushed by it. \n2. **CPI:** CPI is trending downward, but if you look at wages and day to day consumption (food, housing etc), those are still moving up month over month. And we know that high inflation doesn't happen overnight. It builds over time and though CPI has come down it's only relative to last year. I suspect the CPI will start to rebound in the latter half of the year. Why? Well look at the stock markets, it's gone on a bull run and I've been to the mall lately and everyone is spending like crazy. So it means people have cash or credit to keep burning, so there's a lot of liquidity still in the system that needs to be burnt out. But, with bond markets/market makers/analysts screaming out for rate cuts or pauses. The FED will repeat history of Arthur Burns again and submit to it only for CPI to come back with a vengeance. Finally, CPI in Q1-Q2 of 2022 was when it reached its peak. So obviously inflation numbers are gonna look more tame in comparison.\n3. **Credit crunch:** Supposedly there will be a credit crunch as banks will be conservative with loans. I'd hate to say it, I kind of doubt this theory. I only put into this list because, this still has a possibility of happening. But, I expect it to be mild or not very likely to occur. Because the FED have opened discount window lending and big banks are brushing aside this regional banking crisis. In fact they've gained more clients and more assurance from the Treasury that they won't let them fail. So big cap banks will allow spending to go on crazy. Knowingly full well the FED/Treasury will bail em out. Until our debt is recalled in full, then and only then will we have a credit crunch. Overall, unlikely, but something to watch out.\n4. **Interest rates:** I expect rates to go up in May, while that should dampen markets, depending on language I suspect Powell to go dovish for now. And they'll let the gas pedal off, which will mark the beginning of stagflation. However, markets will cheerily go along with it and do a bull market. But, as mentioned in point 2, I hypothesize that CPI will return. CPI is like an infection, until you finish your full dose of antibiotics it will still be there even if weaker. It'll become resilient, anyway how does this tie back into interest rates? As I said CPI will likely rebound, and when it does the FED has two choices. Either allow CPI to go rampant and devalue the USD or hike rates. I anticipate a couple of rate hikes and then the FED will give up. And then we're stuck with stagflation/high inflation.\n\nOverall, I expect inflation to rebound in the latter half of the year, while the front part of the year to be good. So there's probably a good 2-3 months left of bullishness. While the debt ceiling debate will happen over these few months. It's honestly a nothingburger, but it will cause volatility. I'd rather stay out of it for the time being. Also in the Q2 earnings, they'll just say the word AI 100+ times to keep themselves barely together. It will be until Q3 and Q4 when everything starts hitting the fan. Then short at that time or before it. But, this isn't financial advice.
