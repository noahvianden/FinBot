We have a really nice 4 day long blue bear channel that is very tight and very dramatic right now. One interesting thing to note is that the overall falling wedge that we were in support broke today. Which means we should be looking for a bigger down trend and a bigger bear channel instead of falling wedge. As you can see the potential red bear channel I have here support was even broke today so for now we are trying to establish where this is actually going to go. \n\nThe most important things to note from today is that this is the 4th red day in a row and not only that we attempted ot breakout back over the daily 50/200ema and rejected that. However, we did not quite break through the daily 100ema support at 396.6. As I mentioned before current movement would suggest 390 support retest is inbound. \n\nKey SPY Support- 398.5 -> 396.6 -> 395.9 -> 394.4 \n\nKey SPY Resistance- 401 -> 403.1 -> 405.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n158e0rzitja1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=98e51690f64d66f394474be4c4c0a4f94d4d0c23\n\nSame story here on futures we have a very intense black bear channel for 5 days now… and we are looking for futures to close right on the 4000 level right now. \n\nFutures DID test 100ema here however bounced off of it but more importantly it rejected a breakout back over the daily 50/200ema.

Tesla also attempted to break through and close back over its daily 8ema however was unable to do so. \n\nTesla did find a really nice support bounce off that 191.8 support area though. \n\nKey Tesla Support- 197.4 -> 191.8 -> 183.5\n\nKey Tesla Resistance- 200.8 -> 205 -> 209.2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e2gex6u1jtja1.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d24a72aece35d3dd67d2d51d2b4fe5885483edb\n\nThe VIX honestly is one of the most intriguing things of the day… historically speaking the VIX generally has pretty significant sell offs post FOMC minutes as the “fear” leaves the market and there is very little left to fear… however, today we actually saw the VIX drop slightly and then recover and hold its own. I am interested by the fact that the VIX perfectly touched and rejected 23.6 resistance however did not break yesterdays LOD. The VIX appears for the time being that it has more room to go. \n\nTonight afterhours/ tomorrow pre market with nvidia, jobs and GDP is a really big day that I am very curious to see how markets will react/ open. Long term I still expect 390 before 405… however, a relief bounce back to 400 would be warranted. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dtuvy5a2jtja1.png?width=478&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4f95c49e59bccd7620969a2ae8aad8457fde549\n\nActually taking a quick look here at Nvidia earnings their revenue beats might be one of the better earnings reports I have seen all earnings season.
