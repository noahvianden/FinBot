{"title": "$MARA Squeezy McSqueeze", "selftext": "$MARA looks like it will be a winner over the next few weeks.  We could get a mega squeeze any day or it could just churn higher as it rebounds from oversold conditions.  The thesis is as follows:\n\n* $MARA is the 4th most shorted stock on the Nasdaq, with 46% of the float shorted.  Cost to borrow is hovering around 70 ‚Äì 110%.  The company is down 90% off its highs of $80.  Market cap is $800M.  Zero shares available to short.  All good dynamics for a squeeze.\n* Dovish Fed at 25 bps is allowing money to move back into all high beta tech stocks (the wind is at our backs).  There‚Äôs a record 5 trillion in cash in money market accounts sitting on the sidelines.  Funds will be flowing into the market over the next few weeks.  Thanks J Pow Pow!\n* Bitcoin just hit a YTD high of over $24k.  $MARA is tied to the price of $BTC.  Historically, as BTC goes up, MARA goes up much more.\n* $MARA had an abysmal quarter last quarter which tanked the price.  It was hit from all sides: FTX bankruptcy, bitcoin price collapse, and operational challenges around one of their mining facilities caused major short term headwinds for the business.  As a result, last quarter‚Äôs results were disappointing, leading prices to fall to under $4.  Prices have begun to recover, but are well below the $18 level that $MARA was trading at in August when BTC was at $23k.\n* $MARA appears to have worked through their operational issues and are back to mining at full speed (7 E/Hs) as of December!  More importantly, they expect to grow their mining capacity from 7 E/Hs to 23 E/Hs in 2023.  This means the company will triple bitcoin production and will be generating an estimated 24,000 BTC per year by mid year.  I‚Äôm looking forward to their January production update which should be out early next week.\n* The company recently announced a partnership with a UAE firm to open a facility overseas.  We don‚Äôt know that much about this deal, but I like to see them making new strategic long term partnerships with well capitalized partners.  I believe their capex requirements for this facility are minimal.  Need more info on all this, but it seems bullish overall.\n* Blackrock recently increased their position in the company to 7%.  Again, a very well capitalized partner and nice to see them doubling down on $MARA and on $BTC.\n* Lastly, the stock has a bit of familiarity amongst the retail stock crowd, so I could see folks piling in once the move up starts.  There are not a lot of options to get crypto exposure from a brokerage account and $MARA is at the top of the list.\n\nI like the stock.
