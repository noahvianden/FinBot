Our net inventory position includes cumulative inventory write-downs of $561 million and net liabilities for losses on firm purchase commitments were $261 million, for a total of $822 million at the end of the first quarter of 2023. Given we are now in a new fiscal year, the net LCNRV and firm purchase commitment charge of $229 million on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows is reflective of the charge on new inventory purchased and firm purchase commitments entered into the first quarter of 2023. As the cumulative LCNRV inventory writedown decreases, we expect to see an increase in net inventory balances, and over time a net decrease in cost of goods sold per vehicle. We forecast reaching positive gross profit in 2024 and therefore expect that by the end of 2024, we will not have material LCNRV inventory charges and losses on firm purchase commitments associated with goods manufactured at our Normal facility.*  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>*Our cost of goods sold was impacted by the overhead of the commercial van line as we had scheduled downtime on the line associated with the implementation of our Enduro motors and LFP battery packs. As we produce vehicles at low volumes on production lines designed for higher volumes, we have and will continue to experience negative gross profit driven by labor, depreciation, and overhead costs. This dynamic will continue in the nearterm as we implement new vehicle technologies into the manufacturing lines and ramp our overall production levels. We remain confident in our ability to continue to drive our cost per vehicle lower by ramping production and leveraging our fixed costs, as well as our commercial, engineering design changes, and operational cost down efforts.*\n\nand \n\n>*Our target of generating positive gross profit in 2024 is composed of*  \n*several drivers across the business. We expect approximately half of the improvement, excluding the impact of lower of cost or net realizable value (“LCNRV”) and net losses on firm purchase commitments, will be driven by greater volume. Our 2023 production guidance of 50,000 units implies a doubling of capacity utilization which we believe will result in significantly lower fixed cost per vehicle, and we expect production volumes to increase further in 2024.
