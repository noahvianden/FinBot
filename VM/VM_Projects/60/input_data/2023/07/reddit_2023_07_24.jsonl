But these are more likely to be assigned .", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "U can do a couple things here: \n\n1) sell covered calls. You pick the strike based on whatever price you’re willing to sell your shares at. I’m assuming you’d prefer to sell your shares at a higher price at what they are right now. Even if you sell 19 covered calls, you’ll never be truly delta hedged (i.e. having no directional risk) unless u sell 100 delta calls (like 25 strike). \n\n2) buy puts. This, in my opinions is more “risky” as you could spent a ton of money “hedging” your long position and if the price doesn’t move during earnings (up or down) you’ll end up losing a lot of the value on your puts due to volatility crush. The amount you’d lose from vol crush is based on the strike and date to expiry you pick. \n\n3) risk reversals. This means selling calls and buying puts. You can do something like sell the .35 delta call and buy the .35 delta put (they should be pretty close in price). This way you’re reducing your delta exposure while not “paying for the options,” since you’re using the call premium to buy the puts. So, if the price doesn’t move during earnings, you’ll not end up losing anything. \n\nTbh, I’d stay away from number 2 unless you think the IV on the puts is too low. Option 1 is simpler but isn’t “as much of a hedge” as option 3.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I like the collar idea.
