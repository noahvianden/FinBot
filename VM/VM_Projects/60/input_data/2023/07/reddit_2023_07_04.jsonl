This will provide downside protection, but is of course expensive. Keep in mind that you have the option of hedging only part of your position.\n\nMore sophisticated positions for hedging would include put ratio spreads or put backspreads. \n\nRatios would provide good downside protection up to a certain point, but not help much in a big crash/drawdown. If you establish the ratios for a credit you have no upside risk.\n\nBackspreads have the potential for huge profit to the downside but are likely to cost money if APPL remains range bound.\n\nI would generally not advise selling calls to hedge as they do not provide much downside protection, unless you sell deep in the money calls which are of high likelihood to end up excersied and trigger a taxable event.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Seems like selling farther out in time at a lower delta and then exiting early for a partial profit can bring in premiums while reducing the chances of having shares called away.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "I discourage you from being overly concerned about taxes.
