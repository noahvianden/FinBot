Here are the results.\n\nEarnings per share: 85 cents adj. vs 85 cents expected, according to the average analyst estimate compiled by Refinitiv\n\nRevenue: $23.33 billion vs $23.21 billion expected, according to Refinitiv estimates\n\nNet income came in at $2.51 billion, down 24% from last year, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.73, down 23% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAutomotive revenue, Tesla’s core segment, reached $19.96 billion in the quarter.\n\nTesla’s first-quarter earnings call will be livestreamed via Twitter, a first for the electric vehicle maker. CEO Elon Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings in 2022 to finance a $44 billion buyout of the social media company, where he is now also CEO.\n\nThe company cut prices on its vehicles at the end of last year and into the first quarter of 2023, including additional cuts Tuesday night. At the same time, Tesla is charting ambitious plans for expansion and increased capital expenditures.\n\nRevenue in the quarter likely increased 24% from $18.76 billion a year earlier, according to Refinitiv estimates.\n\nTesla currently sells four EV models, which are produced at two vehicle assembly plants in the U.S., one in Shanghai and another outside of Berlin.\n\n\nShareholders who submitted questions ahead of the earnings call for management’s consideration were seeking updates on the company’s trapezoidal, sci-fi inspired Cybertruck, the company’s energy division, and the timing for a new model vehicle from Tesla.\n\nIn early April, Tesla reported vehicle deliveries of 422,875 vehicles in the first quarter, the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the company. Production was slightly higher than deliveries for the first three months of 2023 at 440,808 vehicles.\n\nA month earlier, Musk announced plans to build a Tesla factory in Monterrey, Mexico, a day’s drive from a relatively new factory in Austin, Texas. And more recently, Tesla said it plans to set up a factory to make Megapacks, or large lithium ion battery-based energy storage systems, in Shanghai.\n\nAccording to a financial filing published in late January, Tesla expected to spend between $7 billion and $9 billion in 2024 and 2025, an increase in capital expenditures of about $1 billion in the next two years.\n\nTesla shares have rebounded this year from a dismal 2022, when they lost about two-thirds of their value alongside a plunge in tech companies. The stock is up 48% in 2023.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/19/tesla-tsla-earnings-q1-2023.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard", "id": "12s8od2", "created_utc": 1681935392.0, "score": 121, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 66, "comments": [{"body": "19% in price cuts.\n\n20% in profit drops.\n\nHmmm.

CUDA is very important and mostly monopolized, but there are alternatives and they are quickly developing due to the locked-in nature of NVDA AI and CUDA. There are competitors like AMD, Intel, and Broadcom. Not to mention many Chinese companies which likely will take over the Chinese/Russian market due to sanctions. \n\nAs someone who has worked with LLMs pretty extensively, I see them as one of the clearest practical use cases for AI. There likely will be more applications in the future. \nHowever, I've also seen LLMs that were cut down extensively to 7 billion parameters, given access to the internet and external memory, and which perform similarly to GPT 3.5 or Bard. \n\nThis means that LLMs will become democratized. Anyone can make their own with a few thousand bucks and a programmer. Furthermore, the larger cutting-edge LLM can be cut down to a smaller size for focused applications. These require much less AI training. \n\nCutting-edge research and megafirms and big data centers will need the best LLMs. They will need NVDA gear. But your small companies won't need more than a few weeks with Cloud Access to AI gear to develop their own LLMs. They can then run the cut-down program on an ASIC. \n\nNVDA deserves its high valuation. I just don't see it expanding that valuation more when it's not truly a monopoly and demand isn't infinite. AI is training AI to become smarter more efficiently.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I agree 100%!

Even a smaller AI will still have its costs to implement - especially if you want to implement one with a minimal amount of bias and variance. There's a lot of human work that has to go into LLMs being as effective as they are.\n\nMy reply to the OP was less about NVDA and its valuation, and more about what the demand for AI will look like in the future.
