Pretty soon you apes can afford one.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-cuts-prices-us-spur-demand-2023-04-07/\n\nApril 7 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) has slashed prices of its electric vehicles in the United States, its website showed on Thursday, doubling down on a discount drive against the backdrop of a weakening economy.\n\nThe cuts ranged from 1.9% on the performance version of the Model 3 to 5.6% on the basic version of the Model S. Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reductions.\n\nThe move follows repeated comments in recent months by Chief Executive Elon Musk that Tesla would focus on lowering prices to spur demand and had seen success in sparking orders with global discounts introduced in January.\n\nTesla has cut prices on both versions of its Model S. The price of the basic version was cut by 5.6% to $84,990, while the price of the performance, Plaid variant was cut by 4.5% to $104,990.\n\nPrices of both the performance and basic variants of Model 3 cars were cut by $1,000, the website showed. The price of the basic version of the Model 3 was cut by 2.3% to $41,990 while its performance version was cut by 1.9% to $52,990.", "id": "12ec2zo", "created_utc": 1680848552.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 65, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|173|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: Tesla has cut prices on all their cars in the US by 2% - 5%.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "Sure, but I see raw materials Tesla and their suppliers depend on such as lithium and other metals are plummeting.  Lithium went from upper $60 thousands to like only $20k per kg this week.  Aluminum is half of it's 2022 high. \n\nI'm not sure about Q1 but I wouldn't be surprised if their q2 to 2023 margins are similar to q3 2022.\n\nThey're going back to their pre-inflation prices basically.  People forget that the model y AWD was at one point 49k and even after today's price cut is 53k.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "No, I am giving context to the price reductions.  Obviously raw all material prices are the same for everyone but Tesla is the subject matter of this thread.  The price of these metals have decreased for everyone from their crazy 2022 highs.  \n\nThey jacked up prices in 2022 and Elon also said the prices were too high.  People in the media are pretending like Tesla are discounting prices like crazy.  But to me I see it like it's coming back to 2021 normal prices.  Again both the model y dual motor long range and the model s were actually lower in early 2021 than the current discount prices now. \n\nOne of the reasons Elon gave for the jacked up prices last year was inflationary increase of material costs.  He also said if material cost go down they will bring prices back down to normal.\n\nObviously demand was terrible as well at the previously crazy prices so it's not like Tesla's is doing this out of the goodness of their hearts.  \n\nAnyway the reason I post this is because I think their margins will be a bit better than people expect.  Especially in Q2 and Q3 of this year.  \n\nA lot of people think that they totally killed their margins.  But I honestly don't think they got many orders when the prices were maxed.  For example a model y in March of 2022 had a 9-month wait.  After pricing increases in late spring throughout summer.  Their wait times decreased to nothing by December.  \n\nIt's crazy how fast some buyers normalize the 66K pricing for the model y.  I honestly thought that was crazy and no one would buy it that higher price.  It's a pretty no frills vehicle except for a few cool core elements.  Also remember it being 49K somewhere around late 2020 and early 2021.  I didn't put my pre-order in until this year and prices went to 52,900.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "TSLA bulls who were buying an AUTO company at $220 (AKA P/E of 60) were smoking absolute pure rizzy kush.", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "Model 3 feels like a death box and Jesus Christ the touchscreen is awful.
