{"title": "M2 Money Supply Is Set to Contract Again. What It Means for the Fed, Economy, and Inflation.", "selftext": "https://www.barrons.com/articles/m2-money-supply-fed-inflation-262c7234\n\nThe Federal Reserve will update markets on the amount of U.S. money supply on Tuesday, offering a crucial clue to the path of inflation and the central bank’s coming interest-rate decision.\n\nMoney supply, measured by M2, is an aggregate of currency, coins, and savings deposits held by banks, balances in retail money-market funds, and more. This broader classification of money in the financial system entered the spotlight earlier this year after contracting on an annual basis for three straight months—an unprecedented streak since the data was first introduced in 1959. December was M2’s first year-over-year contraction ever, followed by January’s 1.75% fall and February’s 2.4% decline to $21.1 trillion, the steepest drop in money supply yet.\n\nJust how much M2 will fall is a matter of debate, but few doubt it will decline again. Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson wrote this month that M2 is likely to “fall sharply” with the recent stress in the banking sector. Citi Global Economist Robert Sockin told Barron’s recently that he sees a continued contraction for “many more months forward.” Economic-forecasting firm Oxford Economics estimates a 2% drop in M2 in 2023 from 2022.\n\nAnother consecutive decline in M2 in March would provide more evidence that inflation should continue to cool and likely influence the Fed when it sets interest rates at its May 2-3 policy meeting.\n\nThe amount of money in the financial system is one of many critical factors for inflation. Very simply put, the less money there is floating around in the economy, the less there is for banks to lend and for companies and consumers to borrow and spend. In turn, that pushes down prices, helping cool the economy.\n\n“It’s a clear positive signal for their fight against inflation,” said Sockin, although not “enough for them to declare their fight is over.”\n\nConsumer prices have continued to fall steadily with the Fed’s nine consecutive interest-rate increases since March 2022. Inflation rose 5% in March 2023 on an annual basis, decelerating from February’s 6% pace and the June 2022 peak of 9%. It still, however, remains much higher than the Fed’s target inflation rate of 2%.\n\n“Lack of money supply should take care of [inflation],” Vincenzo Inguscio, a London-based volatility strategist at Nomura Holdings wrote in a note last month. His calculations, based on past data, show inflation follows the money supply pattern with a two-year lag, he said in emails to Barron’s. Morgan Stanley’s Wilson, however, predicts that inflation lags one year behind M2.\n\nThe coming March data will also be the first look at the U.S. money supply since the banking sector turmoil unnerved investors globally. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in March triggered a widespread selloff in regional bank stocks and raised questions about the health of the overall financial system in an era of higher interest rates. The panic among banks could be another factor that contributes to a likely contraction in money supply last month thanks to a decline in bank deposits.\n\nFor the most recent data available, Fed’s report showed deposits were down 6% for the week ending April 12 to $17.2 trillion versus a year ago. Deposits have been falling year-over-year since November, off slightly from the highest-ever $18.2 trillion level seen in April last year.\n\nThe impact of the banking-related stress will be more pronounced later in the year, according to Citi’s Sockin, especially as credit tightens. That’ll lead to extending fewer loans, which means there’s less and less need for deposits to back loan growth. “And that’s going to lead to less M2.”\n\nAnother force pushing down M2 is the Fed’s own actions. In May 2022, the central bank announced a plan to passively shrink its assets by letting securities “roll off,” or mature, without reinvesting much of the principal received, thereby reducing liquidity. The Fed’s balance sheet has declined 3.6% since the middle of last year.\n\nChairman Jerome Powell in a March press conference said the program is achieving its intended effect and the central bank doesn’t see the need to change it yet.\n\n“And in turn, this would mean that U.S. money growth would likely face a continued headwind this year,” J.P. Morgan JPM +0.14%  strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou said in a note issued in February, referring to this process of quantitative tightening\n\nThe Fed’s hawkish approach marks a stark shift in policy from the pandemic era when the Fed’s bond-buying program, government stimulus checks, and extension of generous business loans, worked to juice the economy, leading to a record 27% surge in money supply in February 2021 to $19.6 trillion. Now those stimulus measures are largely over, and M2 has shrunk in turn.\n\nBut it’s important to remember that even with money supply contracting, there is still a whole lot of cash sitting around in America’s financial system.\n\nAt $21.10 trillion in February, M2 was still nearly $6 trillion higher than prepandemic levels, offering a more than adequate level of liquidity and likely still fueling some inflation including increases in prices for motor vehicle insurance, airline fares, household furnishings, and other items in March. Shelter grabbed the top spot, up 8.2% over the past year.\n\n“M2 growth absolutely has an impact on inflation but it works with a long lag,” Wilson said.", "id": "12y1t3j", "created_utc": 1682381731.0, "score": 208, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 65, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We did fall just short of 405.17 supply though. \n\nIf we continue this sell off tomorrow our target is 405.17 followed by a bigger eow and into next week sell off to 399.07 supply. If we can take out 399.07 supply then I would be more confident in a longer term and stronger bounce to the upside. \n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfsvgz4uf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0a8b3eed4d3ac49dce5a5d073c7e9023684eeab8\n\nSPY officailly has broken out of the 15 day long range of 406.6 to 415.6 with todays close. Not only that we closed our first -1%+ day since March 22nd. \n\nWe also clsoed under the daily 20ema for the first time since March 23rd. One thing on SPY is it likes to back test the EMAs. Now I did think we could immediately turn around and reject that daily 8ema recovery from yesterday the bloody premarket made tahtjust a straight drop. We came dangerously close to hitting 405.2 today but we were not quite able to get there… I will be watching that level extremely close going forward. \n\nIf we can break through and CLOSE under 405.2 I feel fairly confident in a sell off down to that 399-400 area. However, IF the bulls can hard bounce us off 405.2 and potentailly turn 405.13 supply into demand then I actually would favor a push back up to 412-416 leading into FOMC.\n\nI wouldn’t be totally surprised to see an upside push tomorrow to retest the daily 20ema resistance. As long as we close under that I would remain bearish going forward. \n\nSPY Daily Levels  \n Supply- 405.1 -> 399  \n Demand- 406.7 -> 409.2  \n Support- 405.2 -> 404.2  \n Resistance- 408.1 -> 409.1 -> 410.6\n\n \n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cn0y4zmuf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=52b602bd5e45b4d4c6330e3ec9f90d5de581d7ce\n\nJust like SPY futures immediately turned around and turned 4153 demand into supply (resistance) at 4157.\n\nWe did not take out any previous demands or supplies today but we did close below that key 4116 demand. We now have a fairly large gap in supply/ demand with downside target at 4040/4055. We also have a supply all the way down at 4015 that too needs to be taken out. \n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j9q4jh4vf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ab4c075fc3df71bb82c2e8fa65c0bdcc1a8cd788\n\nWhen I said that futures could immediately turn around and make 4160 a double top looking at the TOS chart that is exactly what I was talking about. Actually this is where my love hate relationship with TV forms as I love TV for ease of charting but its price action is “oof” sometimes… as you can see on TOS futures closed a confirmed 4157 double top but if you look below its not an actual double top on trading view. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qjuww7lvf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=62d5ee3b6578d777af043683f9f27a517e17acd5\n\nNow the biggest thing here to note is that we too did break out and close below the 4113 to 4178 channel that we have been consolidating in for 15 days… With a break down like this on futures and spy we should 100% expect a bigger move to be had. Now prior to MSFT and GOOG earnings being released we actually were setting up for a closure under 4095 which is a majorly bearish movement. \n\nI will look for a possible retest of the daily 20ema at 4125 tomorrow and then look for a continuation back and closure back under 4095. If bears can get this closed under 4095 I do for see that bigger push down to the daily 100/200ema at 4040/4055. However, IF bulls can bounce us off good earnings then there is a chance that we will see a push back to 4138 resistance before attempting to retest 4160-4198 area. \n\nFutures Daily Levels  \n Supply- 4160 -> 4055  \n Demand- 4116 -> 4005  \n Support- 4095 -> 4080  \n Resistance- 4118 -> 4138 -> 4160\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mjgdbl3wf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3795e3584990aa0aedbd1e0a5fd042b111e87916\n\nThe VIX had an impressive day today being up about 18% at one point. Now we always have to look at the WHY… why was the VIX pumping today and SPY dumping? Well FRC said it might sell up to 100 billion in assets… why does this matter? Well this shows that this banking crisis is far from over… Markets needed a reason to sell and we might have gotten that reason finally…\n\nNow we did see a pretty sizeable drop on the VIX by EOD but if we continue to see more banking issues we very well might see continuation to the downside despite what the big tech earnings do this week. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ockv1kkwf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=5e29d8c3f7e1eb1576552bfe94a569f14767e6e7\n\nWhats actually interesting to me today is that probability of a 25bps rate hike next week dropped from about 88% to 77% today… people are now beginning again to think that JPOW is going to pause because of the banking crisis. 📷\n\nEven more wild is that we are beginning to price in a CUT in June already (this of course assumes we get a 25 bps hike next week).\n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4rtxo42xf3wa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=4aac1a85c25dfcea1cd4d5493f9a5aa4576ddd92\n\nI had a field trip with my daughter today so I wasn’t able to trade but I was able to close my long term 405 puts pretty much at the LOD.

They had earnings a few days ago and their deposits were only down like less than 1%. Its a really solid bank yet today it hit 52 week lows and its damn near where it was at the 2020 covid crash. No way it should be this low man its fucked. I picked up some calls expiring next Friday and im wondering if its gonna bounce sometime by then? My calls are 5/5 32.5c and my average is just above 0.80 and its trading at about 0.75 to 0.70. Thoughts?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I’m not who you asked, but I’m long USB. It’s still a regional bank stock though, so don’t expect a rocket ship. It’s a buy and hold play for me after getting burned on calls. I expect a broader market correction, and in my opinion, that correction has already happened for USB. I think this is likely near its bottom and that it will outperform the SPX handsomely over the next year, even just by virtue of losing less value.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "i just wish my calls were 6 months or more out rather than just over a week lol.

I saw that they announced the quarterly dividend and moved the earnings date forward because the Union Bank merger was “going well”, I had a small loss when my calls were barely ITM, kicked myself for not selling before earnings at $50-100/contract profit. I liked what I saw in the earning and guidance, I also do business with US Bank on the auto lending side and have been impressed with how aggressively they are trying to expand market share (very motivated rep and attractive offerings) and have also been impressed with their lending/underwriting standards. I have found the laxness of other auto lenders over the past couple of years to be alarming.\n\nI plan to buy more shares.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Tbh thats my my style of trading or analysis so i wouldnt really be able to give you a solid read. \n\nIts really hard to analyze stocks like that when its around earnings and a macro thing like a bank crisis.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "What would you do with GOOGL 115P EXP May 12th?
