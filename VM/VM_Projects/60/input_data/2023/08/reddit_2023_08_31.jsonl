That assumes I can get that by my shareholders. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes, which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends, which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking?”\n\nA company trading at 10x revenue which is basically a bubble needs to grow revenue 25% every year for the next 10 years to justify 10x revenue. \n\nNvidia is basically trading at 45x revenue. More then 4x times higher the valuation then the bubble stocks during the Dotcom Bubble. Its P/S ratio is currently is 37 while Dotcom companies like the one I used were around 10 and even a P/S ratio of 10 is extremely absurd. To put it more into perspective if we take for example Apple and give it the same valuation Nvidia is trading at Apple would be close to a 18 trillion dollar market cap currently.\n\nSo I now I ask you do you think Nvidia is a buy or hold currently?
