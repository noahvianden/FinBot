{"title": "A picture is worth a thousand strikes", "selftext": "I have attempted to visualize an Options chain.\n\nSo much information gets lost in numbers when not presented as a visual.\n\nFor instance, apple has on average 15 expiry dates and for each expiry date (for calls and puts) there are at least 20 useful metrics (such as greeks, prices, and implied volatility levels). Hard for humans to digest this information.\n\nIn this visual, I have encoded implied volatility as slanted arrows, with the length matching the Implied volatility. I felt static visual is good enough. The animated version is pleasing to the eye but does not add much additional value.\n\nThe bid-ask spread and the labeling makes it easier to interpret. Even Encoding volume as an arrow makes it interesting to learn about which strikes are actively traded. With simple annotations such as option price = Stock price - Strike makes it welcoming to options beginners.\n\nWhat else can we add/ remove?\n\nIf you want to, send me your ticker, and I will make a visual for you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/15vgca3/video/q6hstgp0k2jb1/player", "id": "15vgca3", "created_utc": 1692451786.0, "score": 64, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 82, "comments": [{"body": "I don't know what this means", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "That's ok.
