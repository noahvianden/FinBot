There are >100,000 Tesla employees so treat his opinion as the drop in the ocean it is. \n\nTim Apple doesn’t give a fuck about you either, nor did Steve Jobs who famously told customers they were [holding their phones wrong](https://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/06/25/iphone.problems.response/index.html) over “antennagate” which also was touted as Apple “blowing it” in the smartphone market and yet they still went on to sell more than any other phone they’d made. \n\nSame for “bendgate” for those weirdos keeping their phones in their back pocket and sitting on them. Who does that? Another bullshit media brouhaha that went away as quickly as it arrived before being revived as the second coming of “bendgate” because a YouTuber snapped a new shaped iPad Pro in half. So much faux outrage. So much FUD. So much media trickery. Stop reading Elon’s tweets and go actually live your life instead of choosing to be offended by the opinions of a billionaire. Life is too short. \n\nApple has often cut prices in recessionary environments, they also regularly increase prices in inflationary ones or with new models and then reduce them over time as the mass production of parts makes those products more affordable and demand wanes for them as [brilliantly detailed](https://twitter.com/asymco/status/1175732030228901889) by Horace Deidu on how iPhone pricing has tracked over the years. \n\nThis doesn’t come close to telling the full story though, iPhone prices rose by [10% or more](https://www.laptopmag.com/news/iphone-14-price-increase-uk-europe) outside the US last year alone and will very likely drop this year as supply chains ease. There are multiple examples of Apple [slashing](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2020/05/16/ruthless-apple-slashes-iphone--ipad-prices-to-fend-off-rivals-bad-news-for-android/) prices in the past when faced with stronger competition, because at a 40% margin they can afford to do so with a near zero impact to ASP just like Tesla can with their 30% margins. \n\nElon has been an asshole for longer than I’ve been a Tesla investor, this is nothing more than the latest “pedo guy” or “arrest only me” covid rule breaking shenanigans. It doesn’t matter. It isn’t anything to do with sales at all. If you’re that easy to manipulate as consumer that papa Elon saying something you don’t agree with makes you swear never to buy a Tesla, just imagine what his little right wing dalliance is doing in the opposite direction with the coal rolling truck bros for Cybertruck. \n\nGet over it.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "Do you own a Tesla?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I do. \n\nGot my first in 2020 and I just collected my second in December 2022. \n\nMy politics are centre left leaning, I firmly believe trans rights are human rights and being mixed race myself, that being woke is not a mind virus, just an inconvenient truth for a lot of rich assholes like Elon. \n\nBut I don’t really give a shit because I’m not marrying the guy, nor ever likely to have to interact with his close minded views in person and the car I buy isn’t worn like a political ribbon.

As for why? Well, again I’m an investor for one and this is an investor sub. So I’m literally bought in, as most of us are. \n\nThe most money I’ve lost through investing has been by investing in companies I didn’t fully understand. I got burned once and won’t do it again. I first bought $TSLA way back in like 2016 around the time of the Model 3 ramp, when it became absolutely clear things were about to go insane. I’d started paying attention to them after the South Australia battery story so after some research and making an initial investment I said then if my shares went up enough to cover a Model 3, I’d buy one. Then they did. So I did. That vehicle solidified my belief in my investment even further and I’ve continued to double down when it looked good value. Gambled with options a little but things got bubbly so mostly just stayed long. Even at todays prices I’m still up on my investment in the company. \n\nI’m also old enough to have lived through the Apple/Android wars and so having been called a fanboy who doesn’t know what he’s talking about for around 20 years, I didn’t listen to the FUD then either and kept investing in Apple as they became the largest company in the world. The same applies here, I’m confident Tesla will be larger than Apple eventually. \n\nBecause of that, I think it’s worth sharing my perspective, particularly when the current discourse is getting hysterical over objectively nothing. If I thought there was a chance any of the brouhaha mattered and would impact my investment in the long term and I’d be amongst the first to cash out and say the same, but it’s generally just reactionary bullshit that is worth counterbalancing. Especially in times of turmoil where you have investors doing really stupid shit like selling low after they bought high because of something Elon said that doesn’t exactly match their personal perspective. I’m here to have fun and make money and hopefully share some insight that might help a few others do the same.\n\nEdit: Also worth mentioning, I’m not totally emotionless. I sold all my shares in an Elon-fuelled rage after the covid denialism in 2020 and then immediately regretted my decisions as the stock recovered and bought back in after missing out on a chunk of profit on the way back up.

I have no skin in the game, but I sure was excited that this stuff was coming. Any thoughts on this?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Tesla Energy to me is the most exciting part.  \nIt has the potential to be larger than the car business. \n\nThe delays here on the battery side are mostly due to cell supply, bearing in mind there was a time when Tesla was consuming in one year as many lithium batteries as had been produced worldwide the year before. It’s definitely been a little frustrating to see, but also understandable. \nWe’ve also seen a few Megapack fires already and so before scaling that production, switching the cell of choice to a less spicy and less expensive LFP has been critical. \n\nIn September 2021 they broke ground on a dedicated Megapack factory. Now they’ve started to receive those LFP cells for this stationary storage and little over a year later in October of 2022, they [opened](https://insideevs.com/news/618643/tesla-megapack-factory-lathrop-california/) that new Lathrop Megapack factory which is already spitting out product and will, when ramped, have an output of 40GWh of capacity per year just for the Megapack alone. That’s 13,000 Megapacks per year from one factory.\n\nThe best part of that is that is also frees up the Panasonic 2170 cells which to date had been going in to the Megapack to hopefully finally start addressing the Powerwall backlog and be able to make it available to everyone again, not just those also buying solar. \n\nThe Tesla Semi shipped last month and I believe they’d already delivered 15 to Pepsi by the end of the year. \n\nThe Cybertruck equipment is being installed in Austin as we speak. They appear to have mock bodies already for trial production and we’d been waiting for what feels like forever for the latest 9000 ton Gigapresses to get shipped from IDRA in Italy, those parts started showing up in volume in Austin the past month or so and assembly of the machine is visible in the casting shop, so I’d say they’re on track for their goal of starting production before the end of this year based on previous ramps. If you think back just 12 months the Austin plant wasn’t even structurally finished and now it has 2 functional Model Y lines and a 3rd Cybertruck line being built. \n\nNot to mention the 4680 battery factory in Austin which, when ramped, should have >100GWh of capacity. And the carbon copy of that in Berlin. And then there’s the pilot 4680 plant on Kato Road next to Fremont, which is currently in trial production and recently passed the milestone of a million cells in 8 days, compared to the 8 months it took them to build their first million. Oh and the cathode factory also in Austin and the [lithium refinery](https://electrek.co/2022/11/17/tesla-lithium-refinery-project-texas/) factory they’re about to start work on down in Corpus Christi, Texas. \n\nSo energy has a very bright future and it’s only just beginning. From manufacturing zero battery cells themselves in 2020, Telsa are now making about a million a week. They’ve enough installed capacity for around 4x that of what Panasonic have been supplying the Fremont factory with from Nevada and once they nail down the manufacturing process things will move scarily fast. \n\nTesla Energy is the sleeping giant and someone is about to go kick him in the balls. \n\nSolar I’m a little more bearish on. I’m glad that they’ve pulled back and are quietly iterating on it, I think the actual solar roof tile has quite a way to go yet, not in terms of physically working, that’s already there, it’s the efficient installation that still seems to be the problem and while Tesla are great at efficient factories, 6 guys scrambling over a roof for a couple days is harder optimise. They’ll get there, but may need a couple more years before integrated tiles take over from roof mounted panels.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "My god that’s a lot to digest. Big thank you.

So are we supposed to believe it was him taking on a 5th company which was the straw that broke the camels back and a trigger for a collapse in the stock? \n\nSeems implausible… \n\nIf I’d have bought at the top and was significantly down it’d probably be an easy scapegoat, but I bought in well below where we are today, so… Meh. \n\nThe stock markets are irrational, they can often stay that way longer than investors can stay liquid, but in the long run it doesn’t matter what Elon does if Tesla continues to grow at an average of 50% a year for the foreseeable future as they have been for some time.
