{"title": "$BAC stock is looking good for a long call", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\n[BAC STONK CHART](https://preview.redd.it/4z1dgox7sc9a1.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f9ce9b4f0e6432b59d19602dd0dcc86ad128aae)\n\nBasically from my 3 minutes of research I've determined that banks make more monies from interest rates going up and banks have been pretty beat up lately, and Bank of America ($BAC) is a bank stock that hasn't already had a massive shrek candle like ($JPM), also from this healthy pullback I've also gotten an alert on my stock indicator that we going up soon. Anyways yeah, game plan on Tuesday is to go all in on $BAC stonk and buy as many shares as possible, also the stock bounced off resistance recently and just looks like it's going to go higher and break the 200 day moving average, earning have also been ight, that's about it tbh, uh what else, oh yeah I'm not a financial advisor. My price target is $34.5, a roughly 4% return from the current $33.18 per share price. I expect this price target to be hit within 1-2 weeks, stop loss will be at $32 per share or roughly a -3.5% decrease from the current price. If you have a big boy account just buy shares, if you want to leverage and go with options I recommend buy the  **BAC $34 Call 1/27/2023** option. Keep in mind the only thing that could ruin this trade is if the S&P 500 decides to crash, I doubt it will, but who knows. As such I'm going to just stick to buying shares with my stop loss, however if I were to go with buying the options I wouldn't buy heavy and I'd be mentally prepared to lose it all or use a -50% stop loss, the call options are pretty cheap right now.

But if I know that, sophistikated gamblers *definitely* do and it should already be priced in. So the upside doesn't really make a big difference, apparently,  but the downside does, since the stock is pulling back deeper.\n\nKeep your eyes on the other big banks and XLF. BAC plays are gonna have more slip and worse greeks than either JPM or XLF. The deeper pull-back from Nov highs makes it look like a sweeter play than JPM, but if BAC goes up JPM & XLF are gonna fo sho. I mean, JPM looks like it even has better premiums for the buyer, through TDA. BAC looks better for the seller b/c higher iv. Check it out thoroughly. \n\nWhat kinda strategy were you gonna go for?
