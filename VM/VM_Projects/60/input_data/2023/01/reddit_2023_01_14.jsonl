I completely agree.  Here is my case:\n\n1) Higher interest rates, due to how percentage math works, get higher loan margins.  The loans are assets.  The deposits are technically liabilities but more on that in a minute.\n\n2) Fractional reserve banking means their reserves do not dwindle when issuing loans.  The money is created at the loan origination.  So if you borrow $100 bucks, that $100 is not pulled out against the bank's reserves and instead shows up as an asset on the bank's balance sheet (the loan).  High rates may diminish heavy loans, but they will not diminish people running out of money looking for emergency funds.  This is bullish.  More loans means more earnings.\n\n3) Investment banking volume going down can diminish fee revenue, but, again, this is going to be exceeded by the fact that......\n\n4) These banks can cut overhead significantly.  They have access to RRP, with an overnight rate annualized higher than the 2 year Treasury.  There will be withdrawals as people run out of cash, and there will be payouts on money markets to keep money in but there will be margin on those payouts.\n\n\nBanks literally are going to collect interest from the Fed on their liabilities.  Combine that with job cuts in investment divisions and less mortgage volume and you have a VERY strong case to be extremely bullish on underlying metrics which can pump JP and BOA very high.  WF and C will benefit but not to the same degree.  \n\nThe publicly traded investment banks GS and MS I would stay away from.  Too much reliance on investment fees.  \n\nI am ultra-long JP and BOA and I love those divvies.
