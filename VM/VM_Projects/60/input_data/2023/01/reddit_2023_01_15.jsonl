{"title": "Tesla Average Sales Price and Automotive Gross Margin won't go down as much as some might think after price cuts", "selftext": "Tesla recently cut prices significantly around the world, causing some concern that the average selling price will decline significantly and automotive gross margin with it as well. This is true to some extent, but it will not be as bad as some might predict - you shouldn't simply take the price cut percentage and subtract from the latest quarter's gross profit margin to get the new gross margin. Also, it is not accurate to simply assume a fixed percentage cut and apply it to last quarter's average selling price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInstead, it is better to take a bottoms-up approach - recording the prices in the 9 countries (US, China, Germany, UK, Canada, France, Korea, Australia, Japan) with the most Tesla sales, make some informed conservative assumptions around take rates for options on the cars, and multiply by the shares of each market. Here's a sample of the ASP for US, China, Germany, and Korea (please note the prices listed here may be lower than on the website because I exclude VAT taxes, EV credits, and destination fees):\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h3rlqvoae4ca1.png?width=1802&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaa4109f89a16ef2ef2b3f23d63653ce3ff297ef\n\nThe result for the average selling price on the Model 3/Y is as follows:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4vb0m0bf4ca1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=203a860cc6a417d2d1e1b25b8ea51afaf25e6f10\n\nSo how does this ASP for the S3XY lineup compare historically? It would be the lowest ASP in 7 quarters, but not that much lower. See below graph. How come it's not totally cratering? Mostly because Tesla was \\[running down a significant backlog in Q3 and Q4\\]([https://twitter.com/TroyTeslike/status/1609346097733828609](https://twitter.com/TroyTeslike/status/1609346097733828609)), and those cars were ordered months before at much lower prices. Hence Q3 and Q4 ASP is not as high as the prices on the website during Q3/Q4 would imply, and therefore Q1 is not as much of a drop off as one might think.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jhlrmyiag4ca1.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8b6c5a7aa3c7dd09d12dd82bd0c366b1a784271\n\nSo what about the impact to gross profit margins? To figure that out, we need to look at average cost of goods sold, which is simple to calculate historically based on previous quarters (consider automotive revenue excluding leases and regulatory credits, and divide by the number of cars excluding leases).  I estimated Q4 and Q1 and they will show reductions due to Berlin/Austin ramp efficiencies, cost reductions from commodity spot prices, changing model mix, and foreign exchange rates. The largest driver of declines from Q2 is better fixed cost absorption after the ramp up of the Berlin and Austin factories. Here is the resulting cost of goods sold:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0xab39pni4ca1.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=72d100e4060db814a88e3d9e82cad6da3a45bed9\n\nNow that we have automotive average selling price and average cost of goods sold computed, we can see that gross margin will not be much lower than prior quarters:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rfllp5g9j4ca1.png?width=928&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac194fec7f625fb2dea4e1f1bf5e1f2626293fa8\n\nThe likelihood that the large price cuts can spur demand and potentially get Tesla up to 475k units in Q1 without cratering ASPs and gross margins is a great sign for Tesla's profitability going forward, and likely means that analysts will significantly underestimate Tesla's profits in the year ahead.\n\nPlease share any thoughts or critiques.", "id": "10c9bin", "created_utc": 1673753318.0, "score": 146, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 63, "comments": [{"body": "I think Q4 earnings will shed some light on current margins.
