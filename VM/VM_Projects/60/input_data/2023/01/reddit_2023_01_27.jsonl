You'll be able to tell what the long-term \"normal\" IV is for the stock, relative to what the \"front week\" expiration IVs are, and make a decision on how much crush you are willing to deal with.\n\nThis is best done the week of the ER, as that will most accurately represent the actual IV of the ER day vs. the following weeks. You don't want to buy any options this far out anyway, it would be best to do this the last trading day before the ER.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Should I be looking out for a certain ratio of Delta / Vega?\n\nSince you would be trading options that have minimal likelihood of appreciable change in IV, the vega should not much matter. Given how options are priced and how the strength of the convexity changes with time to expiration, you would want to buy options that have sufficient delta to benefit from any move (which means not obscenely OTM), and sufficient gamma that the delta changes quickly in your favor on a favorable move (but that you don't get wrecked on an unfavorable move). Longer-dated options will have a gentler (but broader) gamma curve, shorter-dated options will have a stronger (and narrower) gamma curve, so the longer-dated options might see more of a move for a given move in the underlying than shorter-dated -- but you can stack up the leverage in shorter-dated options for the same money, and potentially reap huge benefits on a big move if the price moves into the influence of that bell in the gamma curve. \n\nNote that you also don't have to pick a single strike/expiration -- you can spread out your risk along the chains -- for instance, put half of the amount you wish to risk into a longer-dated, more-likely-to-move-with-less-underlying-move option(s), and the rest into shorter-dated, higher-powered \"lotto\" options.

Thanks to gamma, the highest-powered options will be the shortest-dated OTM (but not that far away from the bell in the gamma curve). These are also the options most likely to get crushed the most, so you don't want to purchase only those -- you'd like something that still benefits from a modest move in the underlying, enough to cover all of your premium paid, and have some left over for profit (in the best case).\n\nSay I want to risk up to $500 on the $AMD ER after market on Tuesday.\n\nIf at EOD on Tuesday I buy a single Mar-03 70p and 25 Feb-03 60p, my breakeven, with reasonable IV assumptions for the following morning at 10AM and accounting for theta, my breakeven is about $71.60 -- roughly a $4 (5.3%) move from current $AMD price. If $AMD surprises badly to the downside and hits $65 at the same time next morining, my position is up 353% to about $1670.\n\nLets say I instead buy two of those Mar-03 70p, for $2.34 each. My B/E is about $74, which is the historic average move, and the same large surprise move to $65 is a 180% gain for $840 or so. Still nice gains, but half of what the other scenario could net (if I am expecting, or wish to insure against, such a large move).\n\nWhat we've done in the first scenario is trade some \"safer\" gains for some added dynamite. I'm still risking the same amount in each trade, but I get more bang (on larger moves) for my premium dollar with the addition of those potential high-gamma options. If I were to put everything into those options, I can make more on the large move (the B/E for 50 of the Feb-03 60p is about the same) but if the market doesn't reach my B/E, I'm just losing money. And of course, if I am wrong on direction, it's a loss no matter what.\n\nSo it's a tradeoff -- it's a matter of taking the amount you are willing to risk and identifying a combination of options that works for your forecasts for underlying move and for post-ER IV (you'll need a tool that lets you specify time, price and IV -- Power Etrade TradeLab does this, and I think OptionStrat might as well, for example).", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "If you believe it will be enough to breach BEP, then earnings play makes more  sense.

Keep in mind that Wednesday next week if FOMC week. Jpow will deliver not only a rate hike but also more importantly is he will give guidance about futures fed rates… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6vkwhe39unea1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=34da72f58d042873fb8e28b011e8afff474a9584\n\nTaking a look at the CME fed watch took it is now a 99.98% chance that we will get a 25bps hike on Wednesday and not only that we are pretty much guaranteed a 25bps hike on Wednesday thanks to our bouy Nick Timiraos who is the unspoken JPOW leaker. Remember he is the famous WSJer who in June leaked ahead of the meeting a 100bps hike during the feds “quiet time.” If Nick is saying 25bps then we are going to get a 25bps…\n\nNow again the question remains.. what comes after a 25bps? Is JPOW really going to stop hiking rates? Honestly probably not. Also every fed speaker and even JPOW himself before we had fed quiet time said that we were going to need to continue to raise rates. \n\nFor me I would be pretty shocked to hear JPOW not signal another rate hike in march. There is no way (even if he wants to) that he would shock the market with a 50bps… but I really think we see a 25bps and that jpow will say something along the lines of “we will remain data dependent but its far too early to pause still.” \n\nThe issue here is going to be if JPOW is not hawkish enough we really are going to see a very incredible really here that is going to make this market crash even hard spring/ summer. JPOW has to say all the bear buzz words or we are going to be looking at 430+ SPY. In the off chance that JPOW says this is the last hike then hang on to your hats cause the bull trains gonna rip outta the station. \n\n📷\n\nDaily wise here we have an interesting move here. On one hand we broke through that critical 405.3 level I was talking about and I said that we needed to watch closely. However we have this really nice blue bull channel (with a black rising wedge in it) that we perfectly rejected the resistance of. With the pretty impressive nearly $2 EOD sell off we finally saw some weakness. \n\nTo be honest for the last week or two we have seen extreme weakness in the morning followed by uniformed and market wide dip buying from mid day till EOD. However, with FOMC next week we could finally see this slow. The bulls did close over that purple channel resistance of 405.3, however, with this inverted hammer candle there is a very high probable evening doji star pattern formed here and we very likely could come right back down to that 403 support area Monday. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8v055tp9unea1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=245fa0168cbc69f9df5f91c742d5e86f48f0461a\n\nThe weekly is where things get intriguing. As I had mentioned on the daily we DID break through the 22/23 bear market resistance line. So therefore we are out of that. We also broke through the weekly bear market resistance line too. \n\nHighlighted here is a potential inverse head and shoulder I have been eyeing for weeks now. IF this plays out then that means 408.8 is our top. While we did not quite hit 408.8 today we actually did reject at the weekly resistance for September 6th and the November 28th top. \n\nWe very well could see 408.8 as our top (or just short of it) and form a nice weekly double top for a potential sell off back to previous support of 398.7. \n\nHowever, If bulls can break through that 408.8 resistance then we have a pretty clean shot at 417.74 bear market resistance line. IF JPOW happens to go too dovish or if the market just wants to go bullishly and ignore him (cause they don’t believe the fed) then we are very likely going to see over the next 2-3 weeks a push to 427.5 resistance. \n\nThe biggest thing I want to point out here is this red horizontal channel. This is my 2023 range channel I have been pointing out since December. Highest probability is that we range in this 375.6 to 408.8 channel. IF you give yourself enough DTE this is a great put opportunity for a retest of 390. The closer we are to 409 and especially to 427 the lower the reward to risk is on Calls. The case for puts begins to build and grow up here. \n\nKey SPY Weekly supports- 398.6 -> 390.1 -> 383.1\n\nKey SPY Weekly Resistance- 408.8 -> 417.74 -> 427.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hmmpfiaaunea1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ff0b90b54dcb0b0779693270a1f04ee74dec4e7\n\nThe rising wedge within the bull channel on Futures is even more extreme and convincing of a pullback then that of SPY. \n\nNow on SPY we did break through that key 405.3 resistance and close over it.. however, on Futes we did NOT. We actually broke over 4095 and broke through the overall bear market resistance line… however, we hard rejected and are going to close near 4083 within the red consolidation channel. \n\nWith this doji candle here the evening star doji pattern is very alive here also. Looking at the rising wedge support line… unless futes opens over 4100 we are going to break that support line which should result in a pullback. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m6qihbsaunea1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=425cfb1dcb5a0b21c38eadfc4bde726d8b0b1056\n\nVery similar play out here on futures weekly. We had just a enough move up to wick over the 4105 bear channel resistance, however, the bulls fumbled at the 5 yard line and we ended up hard rejecting and closing under key pivotal 4095 channel resistance. \n\nRemember this 3770 to 4095 is the same as the 375.6 to 408.8 channel I mentioned on SPY. I have been calling for 4095 as a key level here for a while now. \n\nIF we continue to reject here we very well will see a sell off next week… We did manage to close over the 4075 November/ December double top though. 4020 is my most likely target for a pullback and 4150 is most likely target on a bigger push up. \n\nKey Futures Weekly support- 4075 -> 4020 -> 3970\n\nKey Futures Weekly Resistance- 4095 -> 4150 -> 4180 -> 4280\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1agolw9bunea1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=185ab638c9bcb906d40e8ce6a58eccc365aca76e\n\nAnd then there was Tesla… Tesla has put in a pretty incredible two day nearly 22% rally. A pretty incredible rally fueled by not only the EV market but also its earnings. There was a lot of meme stocks rallying this week and today which tells me the top is very near. \n\nTesla has incredibly came within $7 of its daily 100ema after being no where near it for the last 4 months. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/st0374wbunea1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b79bbc8b6f5e1e3c3d9b29f4021e9157c06e9e9\n\nIf you thought the daily was impressive lets take a look at this weekly chart… Tesla just closed out a 33.34% green week. From as far back as I could see and test on TV (unless I missed it) this could potentially be the biggest green week that Tesla has ever had. There was some impressive and notable 28-30% green weeks but I did not see any other weeks 30%+.\n\nEven more incredible is the fact that in the last 4 weeks Tesla has rallied 77%! One month to recover 77% or about $79 is absolutely incredible. \n\nI actually really wanted to short Tesla EOD with a 30dte put, however, the premiums seemed way too high to short. I also am not convinced this doesn’t have just a little bit more to go… \n\nI mentioned that key 176.5 resistance on Tesla and we did see a big of a fight there today. However, we broke through that and actually touched the weekly 20ema and are now in range of the weekly 200ema. \n\nThe next major resistance levels on Tesla are 195.3 and 207.3. I favor the highest probable rejection at 195.3 and actually will look to DCA into a put position there.\n\nNow while I am bearish strictly because this is just too much too fast… Tesla did break through this red bear channel here that dates back 4 months and now is in a new black bull channel. If you look back at November and December you can see how much fighting occurred around that weekly 200ema. This is going to be a bigger fight here. \n\nKey Tesla Weekly Support- 178.5 -> 164 -> 150\n\nKey Tesla Weekly Resistance- 195.3 -> 207.4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fp6a38hcunea1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a917fa7323189af43e50d5a4bd4507a7351a700\n\nThe VIX is actually one reason I am skeptical and I am actually after being a bull for the last 3-4 weeks thinking it is almost time to be a bear again… or atleast neutral. Today during the run up we had mid day we actually watched the VIX spike during that… and then incredible EOD while the SPY dumped we saw the VIX dump too. \n\nThe biggest thing I am seeing here is a potential double bottom rejection off that 18.3 level. IF you look back to January 13th (also a Friday) we saw a very similar pattern happen. The next day the VIX spiked 5.51% and while SPY had a tight range day (with a doji evening star pattern formed that day) the followed day SPY dropped 1.58%. \n\nNow I have mentioned before that I do not fully trust the VIX.. however, much like on January 19th when the VIX had an evening doji star pattern and SPY had a morning doji star pattern… IF the VIX and SPY are showing inversing patterns (which means they are in agreement) then I trust the pattern… \n\nI mentioned today that SPY closed out that evening doji start pattern and looking at the VIX this very well could be a morning doji start pattern also. That would mean Monday the VIX will get a nice reversal most likely back over 19 and SPY should Monday see a pretty good sized reversal. \n\nNot only that its clear any time the VIX breaks to 18 (today we did break to 17.97 putting in a new 52 week low) that there is a top formed. With FOMC on Wednesday as bulish as these markets are we very well could see the VIX rise slightly and we could see some risk come off on SPY too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aqppaumdunea1.png?width=622&format=png&auto=webp&s=befd54a2098e69b1653117b2fb69a6ced3c2555a\n\nSomething else to factor in next week is earnings of course. AMD on Tuesday otherwise we are pretty clear sailing until Thursday where we get a pretty big day with Google and Apple. Which could very likely be a wild storm with FOMC the day before… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wqrn1lkeunea1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1696f8a8f80d6c5f2fa9d3577e3e1477c0e4c48d\n\n**Weekly log-**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kqqojm0funea1.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a661ca4da9c6dfd59095154d6c5533cf88aa440\n\nI actually put in a small -$10 day today (easily could have taken it to a green day during PH but I didn’t trust price action and rightfully so as we got that $2 sell off). However, I put in another great week this week! \n\nBack to back great weeks of trading here so far. Actually put in a slightly lower win rate this week at 78.6% compared to last weeks 89.1%, however, I had some great wins that made this a very profitable week too. I was able to secure two nice weekend swings to start the week off too. Now I did play some longer DTE trades that I ended up holding over night. However, I don’t count those as swings as I was playing a longer level to level vs. trying to capture an over night swing move. \n\nIt’s hard to differentiate honestly as some swings are level to level plays but not all swings are level to level plays.

They keep insisting that all indications the inflation is subsiding and the economy is cooling is 'premature' and would risk 'baking in' inflation.\n\nI believe there is a desire to get people under control. Powell complained that people shouldn't have two jobs - there shouldn't be that many jobs available.

They said they were holding off because they were worried about geopolitical situations outside of their control.\n\nAnd escalations are still on the table.Unless we get some serious escalations that whirls up the war machine (everyone is pushing very hard for that - because that's the last lever we have to fight inflation), I see us at least flash crashing to 350 at some point over something.
