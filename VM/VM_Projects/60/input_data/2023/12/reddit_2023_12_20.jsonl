Since 1928, the S&P 500 has shown varying average and median returns in each year of this cycle, with the third year of the presidential term typically showing the highest returns. However, it's important to note that past performance is not always indicative of future results.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, there are mixed expectations. Some analysts anticipate a mild recession in the first half of 2024, with the Federal Reserve potentially starting rate cuts during this period. This scenario could impact stock prices, potentially leading to a recovery in the latter part of the year.\n\nVanguard's outlook suggests that the Federal Reserve might be near the end of its rate-hiking cycle but may not cut interest rates until the second half of 2024. Economic growth is expected to stall, and the labor market might soften, leading to what is termed a \"soft landing\" scenario, where inflation slows without significant job losses. However, this scenario is considered unlikely by some analysts.\n\nRegarding the bond market, it is expected to bounce back in 2024. After years of struggle, bond yields have risen, suggesting potential positive returns in the next year.
