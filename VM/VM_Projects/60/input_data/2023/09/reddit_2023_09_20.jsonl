More layoffs.\n\nThen, consumers start realizing that eating and paying the mortgage are more important than shelling out for a $1,200 phone or $40K - $75K for an EV.  The Magnificent 7 earnings start to fall.  More layoffs.\n\nThen laid-off workers stop making rent/mortgage and car payments. Cars are repossessed.  Tenants are evicted. Mortgages are foreclosed. Layoffs at car dealerships, management companies, and real estate brokerages.\n\nMultigenerational or blended families sharing a single house or apartment become common. Taking in boarders to make ends meet becomes common for families with spare bedrooms. A single car shared among multiple adults becomes common. Maybe no car if most work from home.\n\nLaid-off family members provide child care, cooking, and cleaning services for room and board. Layoffs at daycares, restaurants, and maid agencies.\n\nThe economy, which is 70% consumer spending, shrinks. Debts are defaulted on.  Collateral gets marked to market.  Asset prices fall.\n\nOr, if too many banks are in jeopardy, the Fed steps in.\n\nThe Fed takes mortgages that are in default and swaps them for US Treasuries at book value. Same for auto loans in default. No collateral is marked to market.  The price of the average US single-family home increases to $2 million. The price of the average car to $100,000.\n\nInterest rates are lowered to zero so that the laid-off workers can still buy iPhones. (Heck, maybe negative to create a huge incentive to spend.)  People start taking out loans to finance their (over-) consumption, hoping for the eventual debt jubilee.\n\nMaybe Congress authorizes another round of fiscal stimulus.\n\nThe economy picks up again.
