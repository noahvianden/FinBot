{"title": "Bank of America a safe dividend", "selftext": "A 9% dividend increase was announced by Bank of America. The ex-dividend date for the stock is August 31 and the holder of record date is September 1. When government yields recently soared (i.e., their prices fell), it raised doubts about banks' balance sheets and caused the company's stock to plummet. In principle, this is not an unreasonable fear to have given that BAC has over $106 billion in unrealized securities losses.\r  \nThe level of worry, though, might be a little exaggerated. Despite having a large number of unrealized losses, Bank of America has adequate liquidity. Even after bringing them down to fair value, its highly liquid assets still account for around 50% of its deposit base. In other words, the bank could withstand the sudden withdrawal of 50% of its deposits. Furthermore, the bank's liquidity coverage ratio is 119%, exceeding the required level of 100%.\r  \nBank of America is a strong bank with a fair valuation. It is making significantly more money than it requires to keep paying dividends and increasing them. While the overall picture appears to be quite enticing so far, investors must be aware of a number of risks and difficulties, including a recession and an inverted yield curve. \r  \nIn the yield curve, banks borrow on the short end and lend on the long end. Inverse yield curves hence have a tendency to reduce their margins. Bank of America hasn't yet experienced this in this year, although several smaller banks did when their customers withdrew money to invest in treasuries earlier in the year. These \"black swan\" situations compel banks to increase savings/CD interest rates, which lowers their margins.\r  \nNumerous economists predict a recession for the upcoming year. Although there is less agreement now than there was early in the year that a recession is impending, many analysts still hold this view. If that happens, BAC's earnings will likely decrease because bank earnings often decrease during recessions.\r  \nIn light of the dangers and difficulties mentioned above, I believe that Bank of America stock is still a good investment for consistent dividend payment in the years to come.\n\n\r  \nhttps://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/content/newsroom/press-releases/2023/07/bank-of-america-increases-common-stock-dividend.html\r  \n", "id": "16iczmn", "created_utc": 1694680725.0, "score": 53, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 62, "comments": [{"body": "This a dollar tree version of ChatGpt right?", "score": 80, "replies": []}, {"body": "When you title \"a safe dividend\" is that why your buying it?

That's just a perpetual excuse used by executives and analysts.  Regulations aren't that oppressive to them, and most regulations are actually beneficial to their overall business and health.  \n\nIt's the old \"dog ate my homework\" type of whining that banks always use when they try to resist.  \"Regulations are killing us, now look the other way while we report our record-smashing billions in profits!\"\n\nIt's the same way retailers falsely blame weather, or minuscule shoplifting, or \"promotional environment\" when the true story is that executives screwed up.  \n\nOne example of millions took place last month... UPS cried that union negotiations could bankrupt them.  Self styled \"capitalists\" always believe that labor is somehow both weak and dumb yet omnipotent and overwhelmingly powerful, so myths like this work every time.   Now that the contract raises have been negotiated and work out to a fuzzy 45% more compensation over 5 years, this week we have UPS CEO Tomei clucking happily that even with the raises, overall costs will only rise 3.3% annually as a result.  \n\nA common myth is how people respond to any proposal that fast food workers should be paid more.  The knee jerk response is always \"sure, if want your Big Mac to cost $20!\"\n\n But a more rigorous inspection of the numbers is that labor only makes up about 11 cents worth of that burger, and so even if we were to double the pay rates of McDonalds workers, it would only add 11 cents to the cost.  Why then would people think that an eleven cent increase in COGS should somehow add $17 to the price?\n\nThese are things that are best described as \"truthy\".  They sound like they could be true, but they aren't.  Burger to $20 on worker pay raise?  Banks going under if they're forced to obey some minimal regulations?  It's all just truthy deflection.\n\n> proposed by Fed Barr? \n\nWhat is Fed Barr's proposal?", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Fed barr is the guy in charge of regulating banks within the federal reserve.

But the key part here is whatever the salary cost increase, will be paid for by the end-consumer, not the firms. That's the most important fact. \n\nOnly competition from another more productive firm can make existing firm pay more to worker and charge less to customer. No amount or form of regulation or union bargaining can do that as the end-consumer will be the one who paid the price for that.\n\nSo in case of bank regulation, who paid for that? You - the bank customer. In case of UPS union, who pay for that cost increase? You. In case of McDonald? You. In case of shoplifting? Also you. This is why any kind of infrastructure in CA is so expensive, since it's already cost hundreds of thousands to millions of regulation before anything begins yet nothing is certain.

Great right? Well yes ... and also no.\n\nFor example, less than 1% of people actually stop at stop signs. So, now FSD V12 doesn't actually stop either unless there are cars with the right of way, just like a human would. The debate has shifted to; in these instances, is it safer for it to stop no matter what and follow every single traffic law (which no one does) to a tee? Because that in itself can be more dangerous than actually mimicking every day drivers who may not follow lines perfectly in turning lanes etc. in order to better the flow of traffic.\n\nSo, now they have to determine which laws that people don't normally follow perfectly are going to be followed and what scenarios are better to act just like a normal person would. Regulators are going to have to make the call on how they want the software to behave and Tesla will show Dojo the appropriate videos to train it as such.\n\nThat said, FSD should absolutely come to fruition in a pretty short timeline relative to when FSD was first released. People are used to FSD taking waaay longer than Elon said it would because 300,000 lines of C++ code take a long time for humans to develop. Now Dojo has surpassed what took them years and years in a matter of a few short weeks with nothing but video training, and it drives wildly better already.\n\nComparing it to other companies like Waymo is where people fall down.

There is just no way for it to be anything else than what it currently is, a robo taxi service only in places that it has premapped.\n\nFSD will be licensed to other OEMs because it only uses cameras and every car in the future will have cameras just like a Tesla. So essentially Tesla will easly have robotaxis, but the truly special thing is that the software can be added to basically every Tesla on the road with the press of a button as well as operating robotaxis with the same software.\n\nIts not jut a race to robotaxis per se as much as its a race to develop software that can be licensed to any OEM for normal cars and be used for robotaxis, anywhere, pre-mapped or not.\n\nAnd its not really a \"race\" because Tesla is really the only option for that.
