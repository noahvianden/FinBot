Can Amazon reach $10Tn in 10 years?  \n⏺ \\~$5Tn is more realistic which is still index beating with \\~13% US$ IRR  \n⏺ $10Tn is unlikely even in stretch case though the exercise makes trillions of dollars look trivial  \n⏺ Even the mix of both higher growth and multiple is insufficient to reach $10Tn in 10 years  \n2. Current Valuation of $1.4Tn Sum of the Parts valuation basis reverse engineering and triangulation with comps   \n⏺ North America e-Commerce – 0.7x Rev.; Same as Walmart  \n⏺ International e-Commerce – 2.0x Rev.; Discount to Mercado Libre   \n⏺ AWS – 10.x Rev; Best in class SaaS\n\nDisclaimer – No recommendation or advice is being given as to whether any investment is suitable for a particular investor.
