In hindsight, knowing consumer spending is remaining strong, people aren't caring to cancel entertainment subscriptions. Also Netflix has a lot of mid tier content and probably enough that people can rewatch things that came out years ago. I find it funny that they also announced price hikes during earnings call. I guess they aren't even waiting for the actors strike to end, as they said before. I've noticed a lot less content in general recently, shows are held up due to the strike.

If you are just looking for your way out - sure, sell now, depending on how large you position is you might keep a smaller portion, but I would take the profit.\n\nIf you want to hold on to your short positions (i.e. you are still bearish), you could use earnings as an opportunity for extra income and sell OTM (or near-the-money, depending how strong your belief is it will tank on earnings) PUTs, again, depending on how large your position is (you need atleast 100 shares to sell 1 PUT to cover it incase it tanks below your strike).

Nflx used to have some nice exclusive deals with A list actors. Seems like others like Apple+ are cutting in and acquiring the quality content and actors.

Again, Netflix platform seems very light compared to any other, it just feels good to watch something there vs. any other platform.\n\nThey are doing great job with categorization and suggesting content. They were first to do Top 10 Movies/TV and now everyone (slowly) starts to catch up.\n\nI can easily skip forward/backward while watching something on Netflix. HBO used to only have buttons in the player that you had literally to click with your mouse, they have finally after years added keyboard support. Other platforms do 30 sec forward/backward, which is really inconvenient. Again, skipping on other platforms feels heavy, takes too long compared to Netflix.\n\nI might be very biased, like I said this is my #1 streaming platform.
