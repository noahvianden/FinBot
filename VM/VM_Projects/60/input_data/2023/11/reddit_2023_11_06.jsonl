It's clear rates go back to zero when the govt itself will collapse the currency under its own debt spending with these high rates otherwise.  The Fed and everyone else that understands debt knows this to be true except maybe you?  The govt is reliant on fake economic numbers and the feds sleight of hand to keep banks from collapsing as currently stands.  The BTFP program is intentionally creating more inflation for proping up terrible financial management systems which should ha e already collapsed otherwise.  And they were going to use the FDIC to roll banks up into fewer entities but once they realized the ramifications of doing so slammed on the brakes by introducing the BTFP garbage heap to hide multi billions of balance sheet losses.    Not only that several banks utilized the FHLB to their max as well.  They already collapsed the main street financials, it's time for govt financials to collapse unless they go back to 0.  It's that simple.  They will not give a damn about inflation once the govt admits the problem is best resolved by giving the largest debitor a 0% rate again.  The Fed is more.likely.to create an excuse any excuse to go to 0 as soon as tax revenue and gdp falls than to keep claiming inflation is their worst enemy when really deflation is more problematic to their current status quo that hasn't changed one fucking bit.  As seen by zero effort to finance on long horizontal n at low rate and pay down any amount of debt, instead it was ignored and dismissed and spending increased!  The ppl in govt don't give a damn about the finances of ordinary people when they spend their money and it shows by their disregard to try and temper any rampant spending habits they might have.  \n\nThis will lead to The Fed creating any excuse they damn well want to take rates to 0 for a short period to refinance govt debts and \"rescue\" the banks by refinancing them into longer terms dates then hike right back to 5% or higher immediately afterwards.
