{"title": "2023: The Worst Is Yet to Come (Explanation)", "selftext": "Hi, All.\n\nThere's only one direction for the market to go in 2023, and that's down, overall. Why?\n\n**Inflation Is Hurting All Of Us**\n\nInflation is high. This has a few major consequences:\n\n* It reduces any gains you make in the stock or options markets by the inflation rate. Almost all of us are going backward, even (in the unlikely event) if our portfolios are green. Our money is simply worth less than it was. It can buy less than it used to be able to.\n* Debt is very expensive. You're paying a lot more interest on any balance on your credit card. This might be okay as long as everyone has a job. When mass firings start—and they eventually will—this will become a huge problem as people start defaulting.\n* Defaults often take the form of mortgage loan defaults and car loan defaults, but corporations can, and do, default, too. If the upcoming recession lasts long enough, many unprofitable (and even profitable, because they don't generate enough cash flow) companies won't be able to finance their own survival and will file for bankruptcy protection (usually for reorganization) or will be acquired by other companies. All of these defaults harm banks, which are the gas pumps for the stock market. This will be bad news for share prices.\n* Because debt is very expensive, and getting even more expensive as The JPow raises interest rates, companies can't finance growth. Even if they tried, the demand isn't there to enable growth. This means that growth stocks, especially, are basically dead. Sure, they'll swing up and down, but they won't move up sustainably anytime soon, on the whole.\n* Because debt is getting more and more expensive, the federal government will have to pay an astronomical amount on interest payments on its own astronomical debt. This will involve taxing the heck out of taxpayers to pay for it and the reduction of government spending. There comes a point where the only way out for the federal government is to print more money to avert defaults on loans. But doing this *increases* inflation.\n* As The JPow raises interest rates and triggers a recession, mass firings will reduce aggregate demand, which will crash corporate earnings. Since QoQ and YoY earnings growth is the single biggest determinant of share price, negative growth will have a devastating effect on share prices.\n* The higher that interest rates go, the more people and institutions will look for safe harbor investments, such as certificates of deposit (CD's) or municipal or federal government bonds. This will pull more and more money out of the stock market, which will lower prices.\n\n**Rebooting the System**\n\nBecause these are catastrophic for all of us, The JPow has to do whatever it takes to defeat inflation. What this comes down to is continuing to raise interest rates to reboot the system. Based on history, the consequences of doing this will unfold in this order:\n\n1. Housing (mortgage loan originations, housing starts) will drop.\n2. New orders will drop.\n3. Corporate earnings will drop.\n4. Unemployment will rise substantially.\n\nTo defeat inflation, a recession is inevitable. There is no realistic possibility of a \"soft landing.\"\n\nMy best guess is that this will take two years to unfold. From when to start counting is another question. If you're waiting for a bull market, in my opinion, you're not going to get it before 2025 at the earliest, and I *don't* mean 1 Jan 2025.\n\nNo one knows how high The JPow will need to raise interest rates, including The JPow. This is why the monthly release of the CPI and the unemployment situation report, among other macroeconomic data, will take on a disproportionate level of significance compared to more normal conditions.\n\nThe completion of the reboot will trigger a new bull market, but it will take a long time to boot. The challenge for us is to survive until that happens. I would avoid buying shares of stock in these conditions, but wait patiently.\n\nPlease remember that historically, **the market has bottomed after the Fed has stopped raising interest rates**.\n\nIf you trade, and would like to meet some new friends and learn together, feel free to check out my Reddit profile, where you'll see where I like to hang out.\n\nBrace yourself, everyone.

The money-printing caused the current crisis. It was done for good, and even necessary, reasons, because the entire country was in a crisis. We're now dealing with the aftermath. The money supply is way too large, and it will take a long time to reduce it.\n\nI'd love nothing better than to be wrong. I desperately want this nightmare to end. I'm not a macroeconomist, still less a prophetic one. I'm only drawing inferences from history, which reliably repeats itself through market cycles and patterns that we've seen time and time again since WW II.\n\nAs long as unemployment remains very low, aggregate demand remains robust, there remains a labor shortage, and all of the other crises that we're fighting remain the same, and there are supply chain constraints, it will be very difficult to combat inflation.\n\nOn top of this, the US is largely financing Ukraine and taking on astronomical debt, which means borrowing from the future to pay for the present.

The Chinese economy is primarily export-based. If exports collapsed, so would China.\n\nThere's a brain drain phenomenon that goes on. I've personally been to China, to their Harvard. Their best professors have PhD's from American universities. The wealthy people send their children to study here.\n\nFrom India, we have a large number of immigrants into the US. It would be interesting to know the demographics of Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. Among software engineers, I suspect that there is a high percentage of Indians.\n\nI mention this because, to make money, people generally come *to* the US. They don't go from the US to somewhere else.\n\nDoes India have more growth potential than the US? Sure. But they don't have the infrastructure, or the capital to build it *en masse*. They'll also need a lot of time.\n\nChina would be greatly harmed by anything that harmed us, because we're locked in a deadly embrace with it. We rely on it for cheap, low-end manufactured goods. They rely on us for cash. There are loads of joint US-Chinese ventures in Shanghai.\n\nOne of the main reasons for our success is access to capital, excellent education (at least at the Ivy League level), and a culture that promotes innovation. In China, it's different. You rote memorize, and draw within the lines. The culture is strongly collectivist and about shame avoidance. It's group oriented, and this inherently discourages the kind of individualism that we have here, which seems to be a necessary condition for groundbreaking advances paved by new ways of thinking.\n\nIf the US were to falter, so would all of the economies that feed it, including China and India. The US is sort of like a limiting reagent in a chemical reaction.\n\nAlso, populations are falling. It's hard to have growth when that happens, because demand can't keep going up. Eventually, you run up against planetary constraints. A larger population by itself isn't enough, though. You need excellent higher education, infrastructure, capital, and the right culture to achieve it.\n\nThen, there's corruption. It's a huge problem in countries such as Russia, and it exists in China and India, too. Corruption is more frequently exposed here than elsewhere. We don't have a perfect system, but it's not terrible, either.\n\nWhen I add all of this together, I'm left with the impression that the US has the right combination of ingredients to do better than any other country.

Unfortunately, there's a very long lag time between when the Fed stops raising interest rates and the macroeconomic response. \n\nThe market feels unpredictable, especially lately, where news events seem to be the main driver of price action. Macroeconomically, the federal government knows that the bond market needs drastic reform. The level of debt that the federal government has taken on is astronomical. It can only afford to keep the lights on through a combination of tax revenue, raising money through the sale of government bonds, and deficit spending. The higher that Treasury bond yields go, the more you'll see institutions and individuals moving money out of the unsafe stock market into Treasuries and other \"safe haven\" investments that carry essentially no risk and deliver a guaranteed return.\n\nThis pulls money that would otherwise have been invested in the stock market into government bonds, and deflates asset prices. This isn't necessarily bad, given how overinflated asset prices are, unless you're an investor looking for a return that soundly beats the rate of inflation. \n\nThere are a great many variables at play, and anyone who would claim that they know what will happen is likely to be wrong.

Several potential looming crises to watch are health care insurance costs and social security and Medicare expenses.
