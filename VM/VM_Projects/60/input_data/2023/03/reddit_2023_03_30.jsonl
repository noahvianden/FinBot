{"title": "[DD] 😱 Google Panicking Puts itself in Catastrophic Position 📉💥", "selftext": "Ladies and gentlemen, why\\_is\\_not\\_real here with some juicy intel on Google ($GOOGL) and its ongoing AI drama. Buckle up because this DD will reveal why Google is trembling in the face of OpenAI, losing top talent, and dealing with Bard's epic failure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🤖 Bard, the Failing Chatbot 🤖\n\nFirst, let's talk about Bard, Google's chatbot. It's become clear that nobody is adopting this disaster of an AI, and it has consistently failed in every public demonstration. It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion, and the internet is feasting on the carnage.\n\nIn contrast **ChatGPT, barely in it's early infancy, is already the fastest growing internet application in the history of humanity** ([https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🔥 Desperation & Controversy 🔥\n\nJust a few hours ago, The Verge published an article ([https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/29/23662621/google-bard-chatgpt-sharegpt-training-denies](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/29/23662621/google-bard-chatgpt-sharegpt-training-denies)) detailing some damning allegations. The Information reported that a former Google AI researcher accused the company of using ChatGPT data (a rival's responses) to train Bard. Google denies it, but when asked directly, Bard fessed up ([https://twitter.com/thelifeofB/status/1641276922947674115?s=20](https://twitter.com/thelifeofB/status/1641276922947674115?s=20)).\n\nThe plot thickens. Jacob Devlin, a Google AI engineer, warned the company not to use ChatGPT data because it would violate OpenAI's terms of service and make Bard's answers look suspiciously similar. Google supposedly stopped using the data after his warnings, but who can trust them at this point?\n\nDevlin then jumped ship, leaving Google to join OpenAI immediately. That's right, folks – we're seeing top talent abandon Google in droves, and it's only the beginning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n👀 Why is this big? 🤔\n\n**It's illegal for Google to use ChatGPT's data to train their AI**. There might be a lawsuit coming their way soon. If **OpenAI can get an injunction on Google Bard or any other of their AI technologies** based on this engineer's testimony, it's be game over for Google.\n\nCareful though, I wouldn't bet on OpenAI either. Any company that tries to be \"the owner of AI\" is doomed to fail. AI is quickly becoming an open technology.\n\nPeople are already running AI almost as powerful as GPT directly on their phones with open models ([https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1640352767616389127?s=20](https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1640352767616389127?s=20)). Also on their computers ([https://betterprogramming.pub/gpt4all-running-an-open-source-chatgpt-clone-on-your-laptop-71ebe8600c71](https://betterprogramming.pub/gpt4all-running-an-open-source-chatgpt-clone-on-your-laptop-71ebe8600c71)).\n\nNew, faster, better, more portable models are coming out every day (this came out just a few days and its 100x faster to train than GPT: [https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM)). Additionally, most of the innovation is coming out of small groups, independent researchers and tech enthusiasts at home. It's like the early days of home computing all over again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n🚨 Panic in Google-land 🚨\n\nRumors are swirling that Google employees are calling for Sundar Pichai to be replaced ASAP. The company is in full-blown panic mode, and their desperation is becoming more apparent with each passing day ([https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/03/10/google-peacetime-ceo-sundar-pichai/?sh=77c995ed4ab1](https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2023/03/10/google-peacetime-ceo-sundar-pichai/?sh=77c995ed4ab1))\n\nA lot of the leadership of the most innovative programs are leaving Google ([https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-teams-brain-drain-researchers-leave-2023-3](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-ai-teams-brain-drain-researchers-leave-2023-3)). Like the head of VR who left to start his own AI company ([https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591447/google-clay-bavor-head-of-vr-ar-labs-ai-company-bret-taylor](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591447/google-clay-bavor-head-of-vr-ar-labs-ai-company-bret-taylor))\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConclusion:\n\nGoogle is on the ropes, and Bard's failures are just the tip of the iceberg. They're losing top talent to OpenAI, facing damning allegations, and their once-untouchable reputation is crumbling. The market will eventually catch up to these realities, and it's time for us to keep our eyes on the prize.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs always, this is not financial advice, but an informative DD for your reading pleasure.
