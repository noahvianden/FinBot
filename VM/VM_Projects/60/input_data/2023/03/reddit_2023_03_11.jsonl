Super basic economics, not sure why everyone has acted so shocked by this. Print money, it's worth less. Econ 101\n\n2) when inflation is too high, tightening the supply of money is the way to stop it. How do you do this? Almost exclusively by raising interest rates.\n\n3) what do rising rates do to bonds? They wipe out their value. A bond that was worth $100 with a .25% coupon is now worth let's say $85, because today I could buy a bond with a 4% coupon.\n\nThey held tons of money in bonds that all had the same duration. They managed risk terribly. They could have managed it better by not being fucking idiots. Would you put 75% of money into 10 or 20 year treasuries right now if they were yielding .25%? Would you do it if you owed potentially all of that money to other people? Probably not, because there is always the chance rates go up, which would wipe out your investments value.

With rising interest rates, their existing bonds liquid values are getting hammered in the open market because new bonds have much higher interest rates.
