{"title": "If you are in any doubt ask yourself, \"Would DFV sell at this price?\"", "selftext": "After going on stand and in front of the world, and say that he is not a cat, would he ever sell below 1k or even 10k? Everyone's going through analysis paralysis. If you want to read my other post about 1, 2 and 3. Tldr below\n\n\nNo proof or DD just opinions. \n\n1. First things first, what people have to realize is our society is based on and run on profits. (more so in America) Financial, health, food, education industry, all them big dogs 1% etc want profits. \n\n2. Now that you know that, they'll do whatever the fuck they can to make said profits. Some stay in the straight and narrow, the rest is that 1%. I get it, you want to make money, everyone does. So they find ways to evade tax, pay off people, make friends with higher-ups coughgovernmentofficials. This is all theory. Take it as you will. \n\n3. I explain 1 and 2 because it leads me to 3. Jan 28th or 29th or whatever, all I needed to read was some hf was suspicious of \"making things up to profit\" and unfortunately got caught by Mr dfv. \n\n4. 1 2 and 3 is what leads me to believe at that point that the squeeze is real. I read absolutely no DD and know nothing about stocks, and never read anything on wsb because I don't bet on what I can't win. I opened up Fidelity account cuz you know. RH. That was the other thing that set me off. RH, read 1 and 2.\n\nI bet you he's sitting there shaking his head at us dumb apes. He can't say anything or else it'd be market manipulation or whatever and this would all be over. Instead he supports us via his other ways. Stay strong. Why stop at Wendy's when we can make it to the moon?\n\nTLDR: DFV is an intelligent person and able to do his own DD. Yea he has money and was in for deep value, but things change and people adapt, and my opinion is he won't sell low. Not because he has alot of money and can Yolo and not worry, but it's just a better move to sell high. Alot higher.... This is not financial advice. I hope everyone gets their tendies high or low, but for everyone's sake high, because each and everyone of us deserves it. \n\nEdit 1: I get it guys, DFV has banked already. But still begs the question, whether you bought in at 40 or 400 a share, or if you are a broke ass, have money, or have LOTS of money, why settle for less? Wouldn't DFV or yourself say that? Honest question. Not a financial advisor or psychologist. I want tendies and lots of it, do what it takes to make lots of it, that's all. (except stuff you shouldn't do, read#2)\n\nEdit 2: Tldr, love everyones discussions and none of this math and shill stuff.

{"title": "AMC Prediction: March 5-March 11 Huge Gains", "selftext": "# Let's start a little about AMC [Last Year Especially]\n\nAMC is an old American company made in 1920 and it has been around for over 100 years. This is not a company that only the older generation/younger generation can connect with. We all have had some kind of experience in movie theaters and most likely have run into an AMC at some point in our lives.\n\nNow over the past few years AMC has begun to drop in stock value \\[steadily\\]. Most of the drops is due to poor money management and over expansion, recently however it was due to Covid-19's forced closures and streaming services taking over.\n\nEarly last year, AMC bought more cinemas in Europe \\[now AMC has the **most theaters** of all companies\\] but instead of bringing it more revenue it gave AMC a blow due to the costs of property purchase and closures due to Covid and cutting of revenue. This has caused AMC to be a prime target for short sale attacks last year dropping the price significantly and at one point hitting **1.91$** which is an all time low.\n\nSo to sum up why it was low last year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Streaming services being used more\n* Cinemas closed due to Covid.\n* No vaccine in sight \\[uncertainty for its future\\]\n* Bankruptcy possibility\n* Free reign hedge fund short selling\n* No one buying the stock\n\n# Now this year is different\n\nWe all know what happens here. I wont go in and explain this to heavily, GME hype led to retail investors investing in other heavily shorted companies and AMC being one of them. AMC sold off shares to retain funds and rule out bankruptcy for the next 4 years.\n\n# Overvalued or Undervalued?\n\nFor the most part, the media has been completely bearish on AMC. The price many media outlets tossed out for AMC has been 1-3$. Now let me explain why I believe that number is completely idiotic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* ~~Streaming services being used more~~ This may be true for the most part, at the minimum pent up demand will have people skipping Netflix night and going out with friends to the cinema. It has already began with people renting out cinemas for personal use. If people are willing to pay 100$+ to rent out a cinema for their family, I doubt they wouldn't be willing to go and watch the next blockbuster hit with a crowded reactionary theater.\n* ~~Cinemas closed due to Covid.~~ New York announced 25% capacity theaters come early March. This alone made the stock shoot up. Imagine a 50%-75% or complete re-opening of AMC theaters? Cinemas are being open soon so this should be another reason to drive up bullishness.\n* ~~No vaccine in sight \\[uncertainty for its future\\]~~ Multiple vaccines have been approved by FDA. Recently Johnson & Johnsons single dose vaccine. Dr Fauci has told reporters recently that vaccines will be made available to **all Americans** by April of this year.\n* ~~Bankruptcy possibility~~ Completely ruled out for the next 4 years due to funds acquired during January rise in prices and stocks being sold off.\n* ~~Free reign hedge fund short selling~~  Unlike last year, this year AMC is the most held stock on Robinhood and Webull. For a hedge fund to bet against AMC when it is the most held stock imo is just moronic. Hedge funds had free reign last year with no one holding it and could barely get AMC to drop to 1.91$ before it began to rise past 2$ again. Now that it is one of the most \\[if not most\\] held stock in existence right now, I could not see a legitimate reason to short the stock or at minimum expect it to be valued at below 5$ which many media outlets have been doing.\n* ~~No one buying the stock~~  Not only are people buying it, they are also holding it. All of AMCs rivals are smaller companies with little to no retail investor interest compared to AMC. They are all above 20$, how AMC is not valued at 10$ minimum by analysis completely proves my point that this stock is just being forced low and is only being held back now by hedge funds.\n\nNow I understand hedge funds who shorted AMC last year had valid reasons. I am not disagreeing here but what they failed to do is adapt to a change in stock market culture. A 2$ stock could be worth 1,000s of dollars if enough people believe it to be that much. Tesla stock right now has higher value  then every single auto-maker stock in existence combined. If enough people hold a stock, the stock wont fail and hedge funds should have closed their positions on AMC a long time ago.\n\n# Now Lets Talk About March\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* March in general has always been a good month for AMC. If you noticed that many of the peaks began in mid March, in some instances a continued rise with new blockbusters being released in the summer time. The best thing you can get from this chart is understanding that winter is bad but March and beyond is good.\n\n[Notice March is at a peak or leads to peak in every year except Covid year 2020.](https://preview.redd.it/na1tpsauepk61.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fe18aa7de5242b29f9393bc332d6c58b8d24f56)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Another reason pointing to a possible spike in price is Vanguard purchasing more shares, Wanda Group still 50% ownership of shares\n\n[Wanda Group converts stock in order to sell, preparing for a rise in price to sell off?](https://preview.redd.it/0fuvle80gpk61.png?width=1048&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d1e6f32c67b9ef97febcb47764085f8744c6d33)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/chinas-wanda-group-converts-amc-stock-to-permit-sales-of-its-shares.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/chinas-wanda-group-converts-amc-stock-to-permit-sales-of-its-shares.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# March 5th-11th? Yeah. I believe so.\n\nA lot of people come up with dates and when the date fails expectations drop and people get annoyed when nothing happens. This one is different.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* March 5th \\[this Friday\\] theaters will reopen in NY \\[ over 25% of AMC revenue comes from NY and California\\]. The volume of people entering AMC theaters Friday-Tuesday could drive prices up leading to Thursday, especially with posts on social media showing packed theaters.\n\n[https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date](https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/some-nyc-indie-theaters-cant-open-in-time-for-gov-cuomos-reopening-start-date)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* March 9th short interest report will be released. In my opinion the stock had been shorted all of February but that is just my opinion. We will see come next Tuesday but if AMC is heavily shorted \\[my belief it is\\] this will drive the price up farther.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ecj12fvpjpk61.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9e7d0fd12cedcab1659dbd3dc1ca69210adad2d\n\n* AMC earning are confirmed to be released on **March 10th AFTER HOURS.**\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-entertainment-holdings-inc-announce-114500534.html)\n\nNot only are they confirmed to be March 10th but they are expected to **beat expectations**\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/amc-entertainment-amc-expected-to-beat-earnings-estimates%3A-what-to-know-ahead-of-q4)\n\n*Speculative but: Not only are they expected to beat expectations but earnings tend to be followed up with good news. I am speculating that Amazon or Netflix may buy AMC and this day could be the announcement date. It is entirely possible AMC would come up with some good news even if this were not the case for its investors to bring its value up. They made a fortune in January and I see no reason for them not to try and drive the price up farther come March 10.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Texas will lift all Covid restrictions March 10th, farther reason for price to possibly go up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* So this leads to me believing from the re-opening this Friday \\[March 5th\\] to Short interest report \\[March 9th\\] and Earning report \\[March 10th after hours into 11th\\] we will see a large price spike in AMC. Can I be wrong? Yes. Will I be wrong? I don't know. What do I think? I like the stock and I will hold the stock. I am not telling any of you to do anything I am just sharing information and my thoughts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# My positions\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ei5kbec8lpk61.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=974fcc3f0d52adf06d4f2e3a03ec5a3a2d99bc3d\n\n[I bought 10 stocks but didnt sell a single one.](https://preview.redd.it/8xn45ngbnpk61.png?width=1996&format=png&auto=webp&s=19fed0d899405746bb3a615069d9d4d2560f3685)", "id": "lwh4b3", "created_utc": 1614732581.0, "score": 464, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 152, "comments": [{"body": "Can’t read; all in.", "score": 172, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "Are you just saying that because we r from Niger?

That’s going to be our rocket, that’s going to be this forum and it’s going to be pandemonium.**\n\nI do believe and admire the collective wisdom (this is the reason why all the DDs we have read are amazing and all of them has been improved or refuted by their peers or a bunch of apes, for what it matters is the same).\n\nHowever, I do also believe in mass panic, and panic and fear are really strong emotions.\n\nEvery single person who has been playing in this casino known as stock market is aware that most of time **logic, intelligence and incredible well done DDs are thrown out the window the moment emotions like fear and greed take control**. (Just remember that people started to stockpiling toilet paper a year ago...)\n\nGreed is what put the HF in this situation. Fear is what we lost when the stock went from almost $500 all the way down to $40’s range.\n\nIn this game, when people lose fear all that is left is greed, and it can be really powerful if we use it correctly (we can EASILY surpass the 100K) but it can be our demise as well. \n\nDon’t forget **it’s not the same a HF having a “civilized” fight trying to get out of this mess or passing the hot potato to someone else when the stock is worth only $120+ and they are losing billions than when they are cornered and the stock is passing the 1,000…5,000….10,000.**\n\n**In that moment is when they are going to take the gloves off and the real fight is going to start.**\n\nSo, be prepared that everything and anything can happen; and when hell broke loose all camaderry might stop and it might be every man for himself. \n\nAnd I'm not telling you to let's stay together until the end, fuck no, we are here to become rich and if we make some friends along the way, great, but if not I'll cry alone on top of my pile of money.\n\nHowever, what I'm really trying to tell you is to keep emotions in check, don't be a fool thinking it's going to be a smooth ride, be as greedy as fuck (translation: hold like your life depends on it, cause it does) and please.... \n\n **tl;dr:** **DON’T PANIC AND CARRY A TOWEL.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.

{"title": "$SKT to $200? Might be rarted, might be genius- I'm doing it either way. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀", "selftext": "Like a lot of my fellow smooth-brained 🦍, I view $SKT as not just the next short squeeze, but primed for a gamma squeeze that *will look insane* and just might resuscitate the engulfed bricks-and-mortar retail industry. There are a lot of heavily shorted names out there, and while I expect most of them to reap massive tendies, $SKT is the one that stands out.\n\nLet's start with the elephant in the room: **short-interest** and **% float**. $SKT is currently the most shorted stock out there, with 31.76% of total shares short as of this morning. This beats any of the names we know, GME, AMC, BB, RKT, etc. Interestingly enough, $SKT's \\*% short float is at 47.25%!!\\*Compared to every other \"meme stock,\" (other than GME with 60% +), $SKT is easily one of the most, ***if not THE most*** shorted names in the market right now. ([https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today)).\n\nNot to mention, *the shares float* provides incredible insights into $SKT's future tendies. Similarly to GME, SKT only has about 90M shares outstanding, while GME has roughly 69M (lol). BBBY has about 121M shares outstanding, which explains why it got somewhat closer to GME than others. But these other names- RKT (1.98B shares), AMC (339M shares), NOK (5.7B shares), BB (563M shares), all have simply *too many shares outstanding*. That's not to say it's impossible to squeeze 'em, but it would require far less capital to squeeze GME, BBBY, or say, **$SKT**.\n\nThe trend in short-interest also seems to be going down, with $SKT and the broader market in general. The WSJ wrote something last week about hedge funds starting to close shorts (or at least being more cautious), and after being the 4th largest put decrease overall in Q4, SKT short interest is off another 19% since February.\n\nOver the past 6 months, we have also seen ever-increasing volume on $SKT. A previous DD mentioned average trading volume on $SKT from the Dec-Feb period was roughly 3M shares, this has increased to roughly $5M shares in the last few months. Today, $SKT appeared to breach the seal with over 17.5M, topping the 10M high we saw in Jan (coincided w/ GME). *This is incredibly important b/c heavy volume when a stock moves up puts massive pressure on long shorts*. *Essentially, if I am right, Chapter 1 began today.* (we should keep an eye on the volume this week, more volume is a *great* sign).\n\nAll of the technical trends bode well for $SKT. But what's got me stiffer than a rock are the broader macro forces guiding both the market and the economy. First, $SKT reinstated their dividend for 2021 Q1, indicating they have ample cash not only to weather this storm, but to continue raising payouts to shareholders, which is quite attractive since 🌈🐻 are getting concerned about rising rates. No problem- SKT has stable, fixed payments, and will award investors for holding- *these will also increase as the economy improves, attracting more investors*. **✅**\n\nNext, we heard from Biden earlier in the week that they expect vaccine distribution to be ramped up by May, not July. This is a *huge WIN* for battered-down bricks-and-mortar retailers who have caved b/c of public health restrictions. As investors race to pick up these forgotten family spots, the \"value\" or really just oversold names will start to fly. **✅**\n\nNot to mention, Tanger Mall Outlets' whole premise is their malls are ***OUTDOORS***, perfect for a post-Covid world that is more mindful of social distancing/sanitation. **✅**\n\nWhere do I think this could go? This is where market cap/valuation comes into play. For all you dipshits who look at the share price and ask \"wHy It DoNt Go Up,\" *market cap is the true determinant*. $SKT currently has a $1.7B market cap, far less than competitors MAC ($2.1B), SPG ($40B) or other highly shorted names like RKT ($56B) or AMC ($2.9B).\n\nSo is a $200 price target a little fluffy and optimistic? Sure. But tldr, when you factor in **how shorted $SKT has been** (heavily shorted by Melvin Capital among others; most shorted stock right now- overall/float), the **attractive fundamentals** (outdoors/social distancing friendly), the **improving economic landscape** (vaccine ramp-up by May/$2T stimulus that will really help small companies), **rising rates** (the shift towards value/dividend-paying stocks)- I have to say, I like the stock, quite a lot.\n\nSo help me God, $SKT is going to fucking *skrt-skrt* to the moon!\n\n\\*UPDATE: A lot of people have been saying Melvin Capital owns SKT. This is **FALSE**. Melvin owns SKT convertible debt- likely b/c they are grubbing for yield (who can blame them on something as fruitful as SKT)? This actually is a good sign to me, as boomers who find SKT dividends attractive will push up the stock- another catalyst for a gamma squeeze. *Never ever fall victim to false information, please do your own homework*.\n\n**Link to Melvin puts on SKT**: [https://fintel.io/i/melvin-capital-management-lp](https://fintel.io/i/melvin-capital-management-lp)\n\n\\*\\*This is not financial advice.

{"title": "Gamma Squeeze Confusion", "selftext": "Because I'm seeing a lot of posts about $150 will be the rocket or let's get it to this price by eod type posts I want to clarify gamma squeeze and what's going on for all you apes. Should you trust what I'm saying? No probably not, I'm a moron just like you, I'm bag holding just like you hoping for that moon shot. I do like the stock and I'll see you guys at Mars though.\n\nTl;dr if you believe in the short squeeze just fucking hodl. Call options with various strikes aren't going to cause the short squeeze we want. This is not financial advice I'm a fucking idiot holding 38 shares, I wanted to buy more but my wife's boyfriend wouldn't let me buy anymore.\n\nNo getting the price to $150 by eod will not trigger the short squeezeNo the price dipping today is not necessarily the result of some short attack. In fact the price movement today is exactly what should be expected because of delta, gamma, and charm and I expect it to dip more today.\n\nThere is only one thing that is going to trigger the short squeeze, not some magic end of day number, not some amount of options expiring itm, no the only thing that will trigger the short squeeze that we're hoping for is short sellers of the stock folding and starting to cover their positions, I'll get more into it below.\n\nNow does gamma squeeze help us? YES! This is like super simple shit. Every stock is going to have buy pressure and sell pressure. If a stock has higher buy pressure than sell the price will go up and vice versa. We want as much buy pressure on the stock as we can possibly get from wherever we can get it. The price going up puts pressure on the short sellers of the stock because they're bleeding out of their ass on interest payments and the price going up only makes their losses worse and worse. So now to gamma squeeze.\n\nSo in order to understand gamma squeeze we need to understand delta. Now I know you guys love your fucking FD's you love those super otm cheap ass low time till expiration bull shit and probably haven't looked at a greek before in your life much less tried to understand them so I'll go over some basic shit. Now the following will all be general stuff.\n\nDelta measures the change in price of the option based upon change in price of the underlying. An option with a delta of .25 if the stock goes up $1 the price of the option will go up .25 or $25.  Delta ranges from 0 - 1.0  options that are in the money meaning higher deltas. Super deep itm options have deltas super close to 1 and that makes sense if you think about it. I like BAC so I'm going to use BAC as an example. Don't go out and buy BAC unless you do your own DD on it though.\n\nSay BAC is trading at $30 a share. I have a call option at $10 strike meaning if exercised I'd get 100 shares at $10 ie $1,000 and could sell them for a $2,000 gain immediately. This option would have a delta really close to 1. If BAC went up to $31 a share, my option would be worth $100 more because if I exercised I could instantly realize that gain (this is the intrinsic value of the option). I'm not going to go too deep into intrinsic and extrinsic value here if you don't understand it just go read the tl;dr above and go back to spamming the megathread.\n\nOptions that are at the money meaning the stock is trading at or really close to the strike have a delta at about .5 so long as there is still a decent chunk of time till expiry (I'll get into that more below).  The further you go out of the money the lower your delta because it's more likely your option expires worthless.\n\nNow delta constantly changes depending on the price of the underlying and how it moves compared to your strike. This rate of change of delta is gamma. I've seen it described as delta as the velocity of the option and gamma as its acceleration.  The way gamma operates is that options that are super itm or super out of the money have very low gammas and gamma is highest when the option is at the money and this makes sense if we look at some examples.\n\nSay I have a $75 call option on BAC and BAC is trading at $30. my option will have a stupid low delta because it is super likely it expires out of the money. Say BAC moves up to $31 a share, okay we're moving in the right direction but still super likely my call expires worthless so my delta will hardly be affected by that change. But suppose instead I had a $31 call option and BAC moved from $30 to $31, my delta is going to change much more because now it's way more likely my call expires itm so delta is changing much faster so gamma is higher.\n\nThis gets us to delta hedging and what the market makers that are selling all the short calls are doing. If I sell a call short that at expiration I'm agreeing to sell 100 shares at the strike price if the price is above the strike at expiration. If I sell a call that's way out of the money it's got a low delta.  Well I'm a little risk adverse there is a chance that call will get exercised so I need to make sure I have enough shares to cover that or at least make me feel safe. So I'm going to buy shares equal to my short calls delta. Now let's see this in action.  I sell a call option on BAC with a .2 Delta. A share of stock has a delta of 1 because think about it if an underlying goes up $1 my stock went up $1. Now my call option represents 100 shares so that .20 delta is really a 20 delta so if bought 20 shares and sold the .20 delta call I am delta neutral on BAC. say the stock rose $1 well now I'd be down $20 on my call option but I would be up $20 on the underlying stock that I have.\n\nBut since the price rose delta went up because it's closer to being itm so now I need to buy more shares to get back to delta neutral. Also it's closer to itm so now my gamma went up. Well the closer it gets to my strike price the more and more shares I need to buy and the faster I need to buy them to get to delta neutral. This increases the buy pressure. Well if there are a bunch of short calls at my strike price suddenly we're all scrambling to get back to our delta neutral position and puts enormous buy pressure on the stock that is until we get to our delta neutral position. This can and does cause a chain reaction on the other higher strikes, our buy pressure is increasing the price and now the higher strikes are getting more pressure, their gamma is increasing, they need to start buying to get back to delta neutral. This has the greatest effect at strikes with the greatest open interest. This chain reaction of increasing deltas and gammas is the gamma squeeze that people are talking about and it causes TEMPORARY buy pressure on the stock, once the short call sellers get back to delta neutrality the buy pressure evaporates for them.\n\nSo before where I said a stock atm will have a delta close .5 that's generally true when there is still a decent amount of time till expiration. Well the closer we get to expiration a stock atm will see an increase in that delta because there's a higher and higher chance you need to have those 100 shares to cover.   So today the short call holders at the 130 and below strikes may have had deltas lower than 1 so they didn't need to find the full 100to cover but come today the price held strong, now they suddenly need to find the last remaining shares to get up to 100 per contract. This puts buy pressure on the stock.  So this morning we saw a big surge of buys probably from those short call holders trying to cover themselves but then it tapered off because they managed to find the shares they needed and they'll just hold till end of day most likely.\n\nNow come end of day we will probably see a sell off (and we already are) because the short call holders at say the $150 or above strikes are holding some number of shares to keep their delta neutral position but as we get closer and closer to end of day that delta is going to absolutely tank from another derivative greek called Charm. Now outside factors may dictate buy pressure from somewhere else so this is no guarantee on price movement today.\n\nCharm measures the rate of change of delta compared to the time to expiration. Charm generally has very little effect on the price of the option up and until expiration. For example say it's 3:50 on expiration day BAC is trading at $30.50. A call option with a strike 0f $30 will have a delta at basically 1.00 because it's about to expire itm Charm will force the delta to that position and a call option with a strike of $31 will have a delta of basically 0 because it's about to expire otm and charm will force the delta to that position. If the price suddenly rose to $31 in the last ten minutes of trading charm will force the delta of the $31 call option to 1.00 or if it dipped to 29.50 it would force the delta of the $30 call to 0.\n\nSo now as we near expiration the out of the money call options are having their deltas wrecked by charm meaning those short call holders no longer need to hold as many shares to maintain delta neutral. This selling is putting sell pressure on the stock and will drive the price down at end of day which could cause other options strikes to go otm causing more sell off as charm wrecks their deltas (we saw this last Friday).\n\nNow how does that affect the squeeze we want. Short sellers of the stock are bleeding out the ass with interest payments and have to watch their loss get worse and worse as the price of the underlying rises. More buy pressure is going to keep and hold this price up, we want buy pressure from wherever we can get it. At some point some short sellers are going to break, they'll say enough is enough I'm covering and will start buying shares to cover their short position so they stop bleeding. This is more buy pressure this will drive the price up, this will cause other short sellers to break which causes a chain reaction of short sellers flooding in to cover their short position. This is the squeeze we want and won't happen till they let it happen so just hodl. Now I may have got some of this wrong, please call me a retard in the comments section below.\n\nI do see it as a good thing when calls expire in the money assuming the long call holders are exercising. Long call holders most likely have a bullish outlook on the stock and I see as being much more likely to be hodl'ers rather than short call sellers who are probably going to dump any shares they're holding the moment they no longer have the inverse delta pressure.  \n\n\nEdit: in regards to the word count my apologies, I'm used to my clients paying me by the word.\n\nThank for the awards my fellow 🦍 together strong and fuck you Melvin.", "id": "lyihwq", "created_utc": 1614968985.0, "score": 780, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "TL;DR - Gamma squeeze makes small price bump, short squeeze makes big price bump.

When you pay for the option it only has value so long as its not expired.

As price decreases, the call's value moves like fewer than 5 shares, so your effective number of shares exposed is negative while price decreases, meaning you profit. This is a win-win so long as the price moves regardless of direction, provided the move happens quickly enough to stave off theta, IV, and interest bleeding.\n\nThis portfolio has significantly more gaining potential on upward movement than downward movement (maximum effective shares is 95; minimum is -5), however, so this seems more like a bullish bet with hedge. The analogous bearish bet with hedge would be to buy 5 shares and a 0.05 delta put, and this has the benefit of no interest bleeding on the hedge.\n\nSymmetric moves that arguably do better than both of the above are buying 50 shares and 0.5 delta put, or shorting 50 shares and buying a 0.5 delta call. The latter is a lot cheaper up front, but it's exposed to interest bleeding. Benefits of both routes are that gamma is maximized at 0.5 delta (roughly, not so much for contracts longer than several months or very high volatility), so a smaller price movement is required to get gains, and the larger intrinsic compared to extrinsic value means there's less expected extrinsic bleeding from the options (until you get into severe FD territory, anyways).

However the company has stated they will not be taking proceeds from the sale of shares and rather wants to increase their capitalization, financial flexibility, and create a public market for their stock.\n* Net Proceeds received from the offering are planned to be used for general corporate purposes including: working capital, operating expenses, and capital expenditures.\n* Coupang is currently not planning to pay dividends and rather invest in themselves.\n\nI really like this because they know exactly what and where their assets are and implies they will be heavily re-investing into those assets in attempts to grow them. Amazon has and is using the same formula by not paying dividends, not focusing on revenue, but focusing on growing their brand recognition and customer base (their largest asset). Amazon's TTM use of cash graph below which I predict will mirror Coupangs in the future. Again though, I don’t know anything.\n\n📷\n\n* **Profitability** (on a GAAP basis) was not positive. However from a cash flow basis they generated over 300M from operations and continue to generate cash flow in order to boost their operations and re-invest in themselves and grow their customer base, which continues to be their strongest asset.\n\n**Opportunity:**\n\nKorea's GDP “gross domestic product” (overall economic performance of a country, usually over a year) is over 1.6 Trillion and a GDP per capita (per person) of $31,847. This number continues to grow year after year as well as is evented form Korea's 2010 GDP of 1.1 Trillion.\n\nThe total spent in retail, grocery, consumer foodservice and travel in Korea was $470B in 2019 and is expected to increase to $534B by 2024. (Coupang is in 3 of 4 of those sectors)\n\nTotal spent in E-commerce was $128B and is expected to grow to $206B by 2024. On a per buyer basis, e-commerce spending is expected to grow from 2,600 in 2019 to 4,300 in 2024.\n\n**Management:**\n\nRange of age for management team is 36-61 with an average of age of 46\n\n* **Bom Suk Kim -** Founder, current CEO and Chairman of the board of Coupang. Kim has a Harvard A.B degree in Government and is currently 42 making him the second youngest billionaire in South Korea. Kim founded Vintage Media Company (food industry exhibition and event planner) which he sold in 2009 before starting Coupang the following year.\n* **Gaurav Anand -** Current CFO since Dec, 2020 and previously served as COO (Chief Operating Officer) from Jan, 2019 to Dec 2020. Anand has been with Coupang since 2017 and previously served as Vice President of Finance at Myntra (A fashion subsidiary of Flipkart (an online retailer which Softbank Vision Fund also invested into) and held various finance positions at Amazon from 2007 to 2014. Yeah. I know. Exciting right?\n* \\*\\*Thuan Pham - (\\*\\*awesome name btw) has been Chief Technology Officer since September 2020 and served the same position at UBER from April 2013 to May 2020. From 2004 to 2013 he also served as Vice President at VMWare Inc which is a software and technology company. Pham also has both bachelors and a masters degree in computer Science and electrical Engineering From Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (this guy basically is a computer)\n\nOther members of management have some pretty impressive credentials as well. A number of them have worked in high level management positions with Amazon like Minette Bellinagan who served as Director or Global sourcing and private Brands for Amazon. Many of them also have history in the technology and e-commerce sector with a good deal of them having experience founding their own startups such as Kiro Kyung who is a highly skilled software engineer who started two tech startups before joining Coupang.\n\n**Qualitative:**\n\nCompany Mission: To create a world where customers wonder: “How did I ever live without Coupang?”\n\n* **Same day and Dawn delivery** reducing delivery times to a matter of hours. (Like if amazon had the same promise of pizza companies with 30min or less delivery) People can place orders by 12pm and receive them by 7am the next morning with their Rocket WOW and Rocket Delivery program (similar to amazon prime and also includes groceries). Customers go to sleep and wake up like it's Christmas morning with their order right at their door. Same day delivery is offered for FREE, 365 days a year even the night before Christmas if needed. Customers can order anything from tomatoes to TVs for free next day delivery (better than any other delivery e-commerce players in Korea). 70% of the population (mostly in Seoul) lives within 7 miles of a Coupang distribution center. Operations span over 25 million sq ft across 30 cities.\n* **Effortless returns** by tapping a few buttons on the app or website and leaving the item outside for pickup. No repackaging, no labels, no post office trips. Just leave it outside and any delivery truck nearby will come pick it up within hours. (much easier than amazon, eBay, UPS, FedEx, etc.)\n* **Eco-friendly Packaging** cuts down the use of cardboard boxes by more than 75%. Items are delivered in a simple sleeve and sorted into protective bins. Eco-friendly bags that are completely reusable and replace almost all disposable packaging. The reusable bags are picked up by the delivery network for further use. Trucks leave full of products and rather than coming back empty, they arrive with returned packages, and the packaging of other orders which are then immediately used once again for another delivery.\n* **Employees** work 5 day work weeks instead of the industry standard 6. Employees are provided with paid time off and full benefits. (amazon employees don't even get Amazon Prime. Amazon employees also have not reported the best working conditions. “People aren't the friendliest” “you're expected to work like a machine” “Work life balance can be hard” “needs more benefits'' etc.) Coupang Inc will also be granting their frontline workers more than $90M worth of stock and will be the first company in Korea to make their employees shareholders. 70% of suppliers for Coupang are also small merchant and business owners with under $3M in revenue per year. In the pandemic, small businesses on Coupang saw their sales increase by over 50%. Coupang now sits as one of the largest employers in Korea with 50,000+ employees and plans to invest over $870M into building seven new regional fulfillment centers, creating a projected 50,000 additional jobs by 2025.\n* **Dynamic Orchestration** meaning their technology predicts and assigns the fastest and most efficient path for delivery drivers out of hundreds of millions of combinations of inventory, processing, trucks and route options within seconds. Packages are sorted at warehouses into protected, truck ready bins making the loading process much easier and faster for drivers. (can get more orders out faster.)\n\n**Services:**\n\n* **Rocket WOW Membership** is a flat monthly fee membership program which offers unlimited free shipping within hours of a placed order, dawn delivery, free unlimited returns for 30 days and **Rocket Fresh** groceries which has become the nation wide leading online grocer. The subscription based delivery was launched in October of 2018 and only costs $2.60! Within the first week of launch the service had over 150,000 users sign up and now has more than 1.2M users.\n* **Rocket Delivery** is Coupangs FREE next day delivery service and the company has said to be delivering close to 2 million products per day which is the highest figure seen since the service was launched in March of 2014. Rocket Delivery continues to be the driving force for Coupang with people constantly wanting things faster, rocket delivery is a promise to customers that they will get their products on time, and when they need them.\n* **Coupang Play** is a streaming platform branch of Coupang that is offered to their WOW members at no additional cost. Coupang Play is currently available for android users and is expected to be supported by IOS systems sometime this year as well as expanding into smart TVs and PCs. Coupang play has everything from Hollywood movies like the Spider-Man series and “Bombshell'' to popular Korean movies and TV shows. (I’d name them but I don’t think any of us know what they are). Coupang play also has documentaries, educational videos, kids shows, and animations with features like kids mode and parental locks. Coupang play is in the market for exclusivity as well with being the ONLY streaming service in Korea where users are able to watch things like Bryan Cranston's show “Your Honor” and CNN 10. Stephen Kim, the head of Coupang Play is also on record for saying *“We are eager to bring content such as Coupang Play Originals to expand our offerings and make this new service even more enjoyable and convenient for our customers.”*\n* **Coupang Eats** has also been launched which is now the largest online food delivery service in Korea, which delivers food to customers using only delivery partners directly contracted by Coupang. Coupang Eats also incorporates the tech and infrastructure used for Rocket Delivery and Rocket Fresh making delivery as fast, and efficient as possible.\n* **Coupangs customer centricity** continues to be their most important asset as 70% of the population is 7 miles from a distribution center. The company has vocally admitted this and consistently and continues to *“pursue operational excellence and innovation”* in order to grow this asset and keep the customers they have. Customer Base has also grown by an approximate 14.8 million from 2019 to 2020 (up more than 25%)\n\nPart of Coupangs business model states all of this and I would have re-worded it but it truly is perfect and I don’t think I could have done a better job. When I first read this part of their business model it only furthered my confidence in this company. Not to mention again that this is VERY similar to how Amazon approached their business in the early years. The statement is as follows: *“We believe the true measure of our success will be shareholder value created over the long term. Our long-term investments in building a differentiated technology-orchestrated network and customer-facing functionality have helped build a business that we expect will deliver significant growth and cash flows at scale. We have in turn reinvested to expand into new offerings successfully, such as with our owned-inventory selection, Rocket WOW membership, Rocket Fresh, and Coupang Eats, among others. We will continue to reinvest cash flows generated by our established offerings into new initiatives and innovations for our customers. We will choose to invest and maximize value for customers and shareholders in the long term over optimizing our short-term results.”*\n\n**Top Risks:**\n\n* Coupang is rapidly evolving which could lead to the inability to manage the growth\n* Coupang plans to forgo short term financial performance for long term growth (Same strategy as Amazon so in my eyes not a downside)\n* **Dilution:** The company has stated that there will be (was) immediate stock dilution to the extent of the difference between the initial public offering price. Though dilution is sometimes seen as a bad thing, out of all the evidence from Coupang and the business model we know they are going to follow, I believe that this dilution is simply to raise money for further expansion. I believe this dilution is why Coupang had a red day on Friday and may continue to be red for the next few weeks or so as it levels out. This does not change my stance on the stock at all just thought it was an interesting point to mention since dilution can be seen as a bad thing as companies sometimes do this in desperation when they may simply need more money to cover expenses. However I think it would be stupid to assume this is the case with Coupang as it is consistently growing its assets and shows no sign of bleeding, as well as just going public. Still though, it lessens shareholders position and lowers P/E which is a measure of profitability, but again, we know Coupang is not focusing on this at the moment. All this changes in my eyes is that I’m going to watch the stock closely over the next few weeks and months to see where it starts to even out and show signs of uptrends and or downtrends.\n\nI have tried looking around for other reasons why Coupang could fail or simply why it could truly not be the next amazon of south Korea but I have yet to find any info. If anyone does, a link would be greatly appreciated and I will edit with new info.\n\n**TDLR:**\n\nIn my OPINION, based on everything I’ve read and compiled here, I truly think Coupang has Unlimited potential. The company has continued to show strong growth and belief in itself. It's constantly expanding into new territories as is evident with Coupang Play and Rocket Fresh as well as consistently growing their main assets. Their management team looks very Promising with backgrounds in Amazon, Uber, and A fuck load of computer engineering. Year after year revenue has been up, customer base has been up, and operating loss and net loss have been down. This company looks very promising in my eyes and I definitely will be investing in Coupang in years to come.\n\nThanks to everyone who stuck through all this. Again it's my first ever DD so hopefully it's not too shit. I put a lot of effort and research into this and I hope y'all gain some insight to this awesome company. PLEASE let me know if there's anything I should’ve included in this, I am hoping to get a lot better at this whole “stonks” thing. As you may have noticed I haven’t given any info on my position with the stock and that is honestly, simply because I’m waiting for my next paycheck so I can afford to buy some. I currently don’t own shares in Coupang but you can bet your ass I’m buying as much as I can the next time I have money to throw at the market. Wouldn’t you want to get into Amazon in 2005?\n\nThanks again, Onions. THIS IS NOT FINACIAL ADVISE\n\n**Sources:**\n\n[https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/9/4/why-amazon-has-no-profits-and-why-it-works](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/9/4/why-amazon-has-no-profits-and-why-it-works)\n\n[https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Amazon-Reviews-E6036.htm](https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Amazon-Reviews-E6036.htm)\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001834584/000162828021004565/coupang-424b4.htm#i4773fe05195046f8b8cb330d78922a20\\_576](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001834584/000162828021004565/coupang-424b4.htm#i4773fe05195046f8b8cb330d78922a20_576)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/03/12/south-koreas-coupang-can-be-a-cash-flow-generating-machine.html](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/03/12/south-koreas-coupang-can-be-a-cash-flow-generating-machine.html)\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/profile/bom-kim/?sh=6342a76227d6](https://www.forbes.com/profile/bom-kim/?sh=6342a76227d6)\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coupang-dives-into-video-streaming-with-launch-of-coupang-play-301198573.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/coupang-dives-into-video-streaming-with-launch-of-coupang-play-301198573.html)\n\n[https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=262883](https://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.asp?newsIdx=262883)\n\n[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dangers-of-stock-dilution.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/stocks/11/dangers-of-stock-dilution.asp)", "id": "m4c50z", "created_utc": 1615660115.0, "score": 211, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "I only read your DD, but I lived in Korea.

{"title": "My Take on Semiconductors - TSMC DD", "selftext": "Reports of the [semiconductor shortage](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/538474-biden-to-sign-executive-order-addressing-chip-supply-chain-shortage) in early February had me take deeper look into the industry. Wanted to share my thoughts with the sub!\n\nThe market is essentially split into two parts. Companies like AMD, NVIDIA, and QCOM design chips. Companies like TSM, UMC, and Samsung produce them. The shortage here is exclusively on the production side. We can't make chips fast enough and many industries (car makers in particular) are complaining really loudly about the shortage. Some of this is self-inflicted and short-term. Automakers cut back production forecasts because of COVID and rely heavily on just-in-time production supply chains to cut back on costs. This means that they were largely caught with their pants down when demand started to pick back up. \n\nThere are strong longer-term trends driving the shortage here too. Cars are getting more complicated and EVs need more/better hardware/chips. Right now, auto-makers are generally looking at 14nm chips ([Tesla's MCU2](https://onlyusedtesla.com/teslas-media-control-unit-mcu1-vs-mcu2/) is based on the Intel AtomE8000). This is an older process node, Intel was [releasing 14nm chips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_i5_processors#Skylake_microarchitecture_(6th_generation)) in 2015. I think ultimately, car production is going to have to be cut back, prices are going to go up, automakers are going to rush to lock in future supply, and producers (not designers) are going to benefit.\n\nThe producer market is really interesting. It takes a LONG time to spin up a new factory (fab). Generally speaking, it's 3-4 years before a factory goes from planning to production. We can't really throw money at this problem to fix this in the short-term. The producer market is also very clearly split into two parts: those who can make 10nm chips and below and those who can't. This [chart](https://s3.i-micronews.com/uploads/2021/03/ILLUS_HIGH-PERFORMANCE-PACKAGING_Overview_SemiconIndustry_YOLE_March2021.jpg) breaks it down at a high level. There are only three companies that can make chips that we'll want in the next 5 years (Intel, Samsung, TSMC), and one of them can't really do it. Intel has gotten 10nm reasonably figured [out but can't break 7.](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-announces-delay-to-7nm-processors-now-one-year-behind-expectations) They've given up the production race and [plan on outsourcing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-08/intel-talks-with-tsmc-samsung-to-outsource-some-chip-production) their future designs to TSMC and Samsung. \n\nBetween Samsung and TSM, TSM is investing much more aggressively for the future. They've already planning on building out a 5nm production line in Arizona for [\\~20K wafers](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/tsmc-increasing-spending-arizona-chip-factory-35b-2021-03-09/) which should increase their global production by 20%. There are [rumors](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/tsmc-arizona-fab-potential-expansion) that they are expanding production to 100K wafers which would double their global 5nm capacity. Samsung is still figuring out [where they want to build](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16483/samsung-in-the-usa-a-17-billion-usd-fab-by-late-2023). It also looks like [TSM](https://www.pcgamer.com/tsmc-3nm-2021-apple-chips/) is going to beat [Samsung](https://www.theburnin.com/industry/samsung-beginning-3nm-chip-mass-production-2022-2020-11-19/) to 3nm by almost a full year. \n\nThat said, the stock is not cheap. It's got a PE ratio of 53. But the steep technological moat, aggressive investment in future production, and long-term demand increases (cars/computers/phones aren't getting any simpler or less popular) makes me confident they'll grow into their price. \n\nTLDR: We need more chips.

{"title": "Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose", "selftext": "# Overview\n\nFor much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at this chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.\n\nI would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.\n\n# New Leadership, New Vision\n\n**$11B Restructuring Plan**\n\nIn October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.\n\n**Trimming of Fat**\n\nFord has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.\n\nFord also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.\n\nFord Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.\n\n**EV Investment**\n\nHere is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.\n\n**Revival of Valuable IP**\n\nIn the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.\n\n# The Power of Partnerships\n\n**Ford, VW, and Argo**\n\nFord, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.\n\n**Ford and Google**\n\nIn February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\\*cough\\* Toyota \\*cough\\*).\n\n**Ford and Rivian**\n\nFord made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.\n\nThe equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\\~$5B-7B) and now (\\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.\n\n# Financials and Valuation\n\n**Financial Overview**\n\n2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?\n\nDespite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.\n\n**Dividend Reinstatement**\n\nGM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \\~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.\n\n**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**\n\nGenerally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.\n\nQuick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:\n\nP/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)\n\nForward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)\n\nDebt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)\n\nCurrent Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)\n\nPrice to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)\n\n|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|\n|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|\n|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|\n|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|\n|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.\n\nCompared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.\n\nMy personal price target: **$17.14/share**\n\n# 2021 Outlook\n\n**Massive Demand**\n\nFord’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:\n\n2021 Ford F-150: 9 days\n\n2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days\n\n2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)\n\nAs you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.\n\n**7500 tax credit availability**\n\nRemember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.\n\nThe way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).\n\nBear Case\n\n**Chip Shortage**\n\nAs I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly 1 million new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.\n\n**Battery Supplier Issues**\n\nIn February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.\n\n**Debt Burden**\n\nThere’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.\n\n**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**\n\nThis post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.\n\n**Closing**\n\nI believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.\n\n*Disclosures: I am long Ford at an average cost basis of $10.30.

{"title": "AMD to Jump 50% Soon to $120 and Here's Why", "selftext": " AMD is trading around $80 right now, it's down about 16% from peak. It's movements are following the NASDAQ right now, meaning money managers are not trading AMD directly, they're just trading the entire NASDAQ. But they will be trading AMD soon and they will be buying. Here's why.\n\nDr. Lisa Su says they expect to grow 37% this year. She's always conservative on the numbers, more like 40% is realistic. Compared to Intel which is expecting 0% growth for 2021. Intel is being forced to slash prices to be competitive with AMD, which means reduced margins. Then they need to invest heavily in R&D to catch up to AMD. They also said they'll be using TSMC to make 3nm chips for them to help them catch up. Intel is a competitor to TSMC, so don't expect them to get any discounts. All of this leads to higher operating costs and further reduced margins. AMD will also be using the same 3nm from TSMC so don't expect Intel to pull away with a victory when the time comes (not for another 2 years), they're merely trying to catch up while they work on their own fab problems. It's possible that since AMD has such a lead, Intel may not catch up for the foreseeable future, >3 years. Remember AMD has a 100B market cap, Intel is 268B.\n\nAMD holds 7% of the datacenter market, that number is about to skyrocket as Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Tencent are going all-in on AMD powered servers. The datacenter is where the margins are the highest, this is what will make AMD serious cash, not their consumer products. And this is also where they have the most market share to gain, if they do it right, which they are.\n\nCramer on why he wants to buy more AMD stock:  \n[https://www.thestreet.com/video/why-jim-cramer-feels-bullish-about-amd](https://www.thestreet.com/video/why-jim-cramer-feels-bullish-about-amd)  \nLinus on why AMD EPYC is now multiple generations ahead of Intel's datacenter products:  \nOn youtube /watch?v=xKj5sMVsMf8 (can't post youtube links on WB)  \nLisa Su on why the chip shortage is good for AMD and that they are ramping up supply to meet the new demand:  \nOn youtube /watch?v=h5HiWsAzahc\n\nCurrent Price Target is $106 with a high of $161.

{"title": "Who will win Autonomous Driving? Waymo Vs Tesla", "selftext": "After watching a video featuring Teslas \"Full self driving\" video Vs a Waymo video I have realized Waymo is far ahead of Tesla. Comparing the dashboard display of what the car is seeing, Waymo's software is far more advanced, less erratic and to me seems evident that Elon will indeed need a Lidar/Camera sensor like Microvisions which will be released in April . IMO Teslas software doesn't seem to read the velocities of other cars and pedestrians well. The rep seems to think the Tesla isn't programed to see potholes. Which we have seen from the MVIS Lidar video to be a key point. In the video the Tesla has a hard time reading curbs, pillions and a fence/ wall and by now im sure we've heard of at least one Tesla crash. This leads me to believe that Autonomous driving will be regulated and Elon could eventually be forced to use Lidar as Lidar could eventually become a mandatory sensor in all new cars, especially Autonomous. .\n\n(Youtube video links are not allowed here but you can look up Waymo's self driving videos vs FSD beta 8.2 in Oakland )\n\nTesla's \"Full self driving\" at times acts drunk and requires the driver to continually disengage the auto driving feature. While in Waymo's case passengers are sitting in the rear seat separated by Plexiglas and there is no one to take grab the wheel and over, to me that means Waymo is more advanced and confident in their tech.\n\nThis in my opinion Is great news for MicroVision $MVIS investors considering their \"Best in class Lidar\" is coming out in April and is going to be a two in one Camera and Lidar Combo under $1000\n\nThis is great news for MicroVision for the following reasons (not in chronological order):\n\n\"Waymo began as the Google Self-Driving Car Project in 2009.\"\n\nSevals Oz the recently appointed MVIS director held a previous position for google\\[X\\] was \"Self driving cars- HEAD of global PARTNERSHIPS and BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT\"\n\n$Ford and $GOOGL \"come together in first-of-its-kind partnership to create unique services and capabilities for Ford and Lincoln customers, and to accelerate Ford’s transformation plan\"\n\nFord pledges $29 billion for Evs and Autonomous Vehicles\n\nFord backs out of $VLDR ( alsoVLDRs CEO backs down saying the company has fostered a anti share holder culture.)\n\nFormer Ford executive of 32 years, Judy Curran is added to the Microvision BOD.\n\nMicrovision's CEO has continually stress the fact that he wants to maximize share holders value and has stated he wants to burn the shorts.\n\nLook at Waymo's website, while they maybe ahead on the software side but I'm sure they are dying to to remove ALL of those big bulky sensors and increase aerodynamics and decrease drag coefficients . Thats why Microvision is so important to them. I'm sure Waymo and google are eager to release a car to the public especially after seeing teslas falsely advertised \"Full Self Driving\"\n\nWaymo Via has been learning to self drive class 8 trucks for 4 years now.\n\nWhen clarifying the A Sample in Microvisions ER CEO Sharma mentions Long haul trucking for the first time in the following quotes:\n\n\"Our solid-state, long-range LiDAR sensor could enable any interested party to perform testing with our sensor on their moving platforms, such as cars and longhaul trucks\"\n\n..\"No, that's A sample. That's where it's up for sale. So as I said, potentially, if somebody wants to work the hardware on a moving platform test because obviously, we're not investing in moving platform testing on cars or long-haul trucking\"\n\nCould they already be working with Google?

Current Head of automotive strategy at ANSYS\n\nMicrovision is up for sale, and to me it appears google is making moves..  I don't see anyone from Microsoft there (Even though Microvision is inside the Halolens 2) .. I could imagine the bidding war is In full swing as both of the Tech giants seem to have planted their roots in MicroVision. We all know about the Value the Near eye display brings to MSFT. At this point Im starting to believe MVIS will be acquired by Google due to the value MVIS could bring to their Autonomous Vehicle sensors, Heads up displays, Augmented and Mixed reality, and interactive projections\n\n\nEDIT: For everyone saying camera vision is all you need and LIDAR is doomed. Check out what the simple application of what LIDAR did to the camera in the new iPhones and iPads, all the new features and laser fast focus, the accuracy and precision, the extra data and speed of it, which allows the computer to use less battery and processing power. I’m not saying camera vision is wrong, I’m saying they need LIDAR to pair with it, LIKE THE MICROVISION LIDAR AND CAMERA UNIT. They need the same data source of data with zero latency between them to bring any self driving car to scale. Im not saying radar can’t be used in conjunction but LIDAR lasers and the speed of light is faster than radio waves as their waves are longer and use less frequencies and make radar irrelevant and more of a redundancy. LIDAR can use more frequent programmable pulses and use time of flight senors to read velocity and create a point cloud of 33 Million p/s with multiple Fields of view. If autonomous driving is regulated and OEMS are required to use LIDAR and a bundle of sensors, Tesla will be in a bad position being so behind in LIDAR. \n\nYahoo Finance talked about Microvision and autonomous vehicles this week in their article titled  \"Two Tech Stocks To Watch As Biden Pours Trillions Into The Green Economy\" and I quote \"And [all] these automakers’ ambitious plans aren’t possible without companies like MicroVision (NASDAQ:MVIS).

No fancy names will prevent loses. As you stated, using a type of trade is not a strategy.\n\nFor me, the setup is fairly simple. I watch around 200 underlying stocks every trading day. Two days before trade I will pick the best candidates with the best balance of premium and less movement in last couple of days. I check on each company if they are not expecting any significant news and then test out few trades, especially when it comes to a direction. If they are trading generally downwards for the last week, then that’s the direction of my wings. Or the opposite.\n\nThen I create three trades:\n1) to open\n2) to stop loss at the wings -10%\n3) to sell at target\n\nI always try to have 3-4 active trades, but this depends on the premiums and the overall market. If one of my targets spooks me, then I pile in in the other.\n\nI had fair share of losses, although fairly limited thanks to the stop loss. So far, since doing this for last 12 weeks or so, I’m up 900%.

I wait over an hour in the early morning to avoid any major jumps. Then I try to get out hour before closing if possible.\n\nHow wide the wings have to be depends on the underlying plus on the premium. My rule of thumb for the wing size is that if I don’t gain at least $1 in premium, then it’s not worth it.  On butterflies there is better premium. On condors there is better chance. I oscillate between them depends on the situation.

{"title": "Monday School: Your orders are not as good as you think they are (bid/ask, volume, open interest, mark, market, and order filling)", "selftext": "On an irregular basis depending on demand, I'll make a post on Monday to address a FAQ or common misconception that I see posted by new traders dozens of times a day. Everyone is also welcome to find these answers in our [FAQ wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/index).\n\nPrevious posts in this series:\n\n[Your break-even isn't as important as you think it is](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/m0m7at/monday_school_your_breakeven_isnt_as_important_as/)\n\n[Exercise and Expiration are not what you think they are](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/m5r8mi/monday_school_exercise_and_expiration_are_not/)\n\n\n**TL;DR**\n======\n\n* If you don't remember anything else from this post, at least remember this: **The narrower the bid/ask spread, the better deal you are going to get on your trade. Avoid wide bid/ask spreads whenever possible.**\n\n* Every contract is up for auction, with active buyers and sellers, represented by the bid/ask spread, respectively.\n\n* Every contract also has a daily volume and open interest.\n\n* The price of a contract is not defined by some kind of central authority or by a pricing model, it is discovered by active trading.\n\n* When your broker calculates a gain/loss for today or since open, they use the \"mark\", which is the mid-point or average of the bid/ask spread. It is an **estimate**. It is not what you will necessarily get if you closed a trade in that moment.\n\n* The \"market\" is the bid when you are a seller and the ask when you are a buyer.\n\n* Consequently, you must be an active participant in the auction in order to get the best possible price. You can't just fire and forget an order and hope for the best.\n\n* There are two types of orders for opening a trade and four types of orders for closing a trade.\n\n* For opening, there are market orders and limit orders. **NEVER USE A MARKET ORDER, EVER.**\n\n* For closing, there are the same market and limit orders as for opening, as well as stop-loss orders and stop-limit orders, to put a floor under your losses on closing a trade. **NEVER USE A STOP-LOSS ORDER, EVER.**\n\n* Liquidity and the width of the bid/ask spread are highly correlated.\n\n* Liquidity is a critically important factor in determining how cost-effective your trades are. Consequently, liquidity should be a priority when selecting option chains and contracts.\n\n\nOptions are auctioned -- it's EBay, not Amazon\n========================\n\nMany new traders seem to believe that the price of a contract is set by some central authority and that looking at the quotes in an option chain is some kind of static price list, like a menu at a restaurant. Nothing could be further from the truth. All option contracts, as well as stocks and ETPs, for that matter, are traded in an auction. There are active buyers and active sellers.\n\nThis means that the current price for a contract is fluid, ebbing and flowing as the number and urgency of the buyers and sellers fluctuates. The current state of the auction is defined by the **bid** (the highest price buyers are offering to pay) and the **ask** (the lowest price the sellers are willing to accept). Since there may be more than one contract up for auction at any given time, the bid and the ask each have a size, represented by xNNN. The NNN is the minimum number of contracts a buyer is willing to buy or a seller is willing to sell. Example: $1.23x100/$1.38x23 -- this means 100 contracts sought for $1.23 and 23 contracts on offer for $1.38.\n\nThe bid and ask only represent the \"top\" of the order book. Prices that are higher than the ask or lower than the bid are recorded in the order book. The details of the order book and Level 2 real-time quotes are beyond the scope of this article, but if you wish to learn more, you can read an explainer [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order-book.asp).\n\nContracts at a specific strike and expiration have a *volume* number, which represents the number of completed trades on that contract for that day up to that point in time. There is also an *open interest* number that represents the number of contracts in open positions in the hands of traders or market makers. It is similar to the float of outstanding shares for a stock. More about [volume and open interest here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/050615/what-difference-between-open-interest-and-volume.asp).\n\nIt is worth noting that for the most part, the active bids and asks you see in the auction are market makers. That is why a contract with 0 volume still has an active auction, because the job of market makers is to, well, make a market. That means to act as a buyer if you are selling and a seller if you are buying.\n\nGiven that there is an active auction for every contract, how is the current value of a contract determined? The process of determining the current value is called *price discovery*. Again, the details are beyond the scope of this post, but if you wish to learn more about price discovery, there is an explainer [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pricediscovery.asp). For this post, the point I'm making about price discovery is that the current value of a contract is any number between the bid and the ask at that moment in time. Until a trade actually happens, the exact value is unknown, but not unbounded. Therefore, you cannot say with authority that the value of your open position is $X. At best, that is an estimate.\n\n\nDoes that mean the gain/loss of my position is defined by the last trade?\n=================\n\nNo, not for options.\n\nYour gain or loss has to be based on the current price, but if no trades have happened (volume is 0), or the last trade was an hour ago and the auction has moved far from the last trade, how does your broker know how to calculate the current gain/loss?\n\nYour broker *estimates* the current value of the position by using the *mark*. For options, the mark is the average of the bid/ask spread. It is sometimes also referred as the the mid (middle) of the bid/ask. Example: If the bid/ask is $1.00/$3.00, the mark is $2.00 and that is used as an estimate of the current value of the position. Even if the last trade was $1.50.\n\nThis is the reason almost every long option trade is opened for a loss. You almost never get the mark as your actual trade price when your order is filled, so the distance from the amount you actually paid to the mark is often treated as a loss. For example, using the $1/$3 spread again, if you end up filling your order at $2.10, your broker will show a current loss of -$0.10 on the trade, because you bought at $0.10 over the mark. If you bought or sold at the *market*, which is the bid for a seller or the ask for a buyer, you will show half the width of the bid/ask spread as a loss on open. More about mark and market in the section about order types and getting cost-effective vs. fast fills.\n\nMy buy-to-open at the mark never fills! That means my broker is stealing from me, right?\n=================================\n\nWrong. Or at least, very unlikely. That has more to do with not accounting for the options market being an active auction. You can't just set an order and hope for the best. You need to actively bid if you are a buyer, negotiating a price that a seller will accept. Sometimes you need to increase your offer to get a fill, sometimes you need to wait patiently for the market to move towards you.\n\nA maxim that I found useful for active trading is: Getting a fill on an order is a contest between your greed and your impatience.\n\nWhat that means is that, most of the time, you can either get the price you want or a fast fill, you can't have both. The more money you want as a seller (or the less as a buyer), the longer you may have to wait.\n\nSo once you decide on which way you want to go, best price or fastest fill, you can then participate in the auction accordingly. For the rest of this description I will assume you want a fast fill and are willing to compromise on price. Because the opposite it just a waiting game.\n\nTo get a fill relatively quickly, what I do is start at the most favorable price for me and then negotiate towards the market. For example, as a buyer, I open bidding at one increment away from the bid. If the bid/ask was $2/$3 and the minimum increment of price is $0.05, I'll start my order with a limit of $2.05 (more about limit orders below). I wait 10 seconds for that to fill. If it doesn't fill, I modify the order (cancel the order, replace with a new order) to $2.10 and wait 10 seconds again. I keep doing that until I get a fill. Sometimes that means I end up paying a price that is above the mark. Sometimes it means I pay a price that is close to the market. That's the cost of getting a fast fill.\n\nWhy not use a market order? \n================================\n\nMarket orders give you minimum time but at maximum cost.\n\nThere are two types of orders for opening a trade and four types of orders for closing a trade.\n\nFor opening, there are *market orders* and *limit orders*. A market order means fill my order *at any price*. A limit order means fill my order *at a price that is at or better than my specified limit, whichever is best*. From the definition alone it should be clear why you should never use a market order. You are putting yourself at the mercy of the auction and the order book and could end up paying much more, or getting much less, than you could have gotten with a little more patience. In fact, some traders actively seek to exploit naive use of market orders by placing \"traps\" in the order book, which are ridiculous prices that no one would pay or accept, but that could be snagged by a market order if the top of the order book is cleared out. Or the trap is set to snag a large dollar value order that intends to \"sweep the book\" and clears out all the normal orders in the book and runs into one of these traps.\n\n**Long story short, don't use market orders to open, ever**. If you want a fast fill, use the method described earlier which, in practice, will get you a fill within 5 minutes, and often in less than 30 seconds. It you absolutely must have the fastest fill possible, set a limit order at the market price or one increment beyond.\n\nFor closing, there are the same market and limit types as for opening. There are also *stop-loss* and *stop-limit* orders to make sure you don't lose more than you want to lose. The stop-loss turns into a market order to close when the designated stop price is met. A stop-limit turns into a limit order (at the specified limit price) when the designated stop price is met.\n\n**Never use market or stop-loss orders to close, ever**. If you want a floor on your loss for a sell-to-close order that will fill as quickly as possible, set a stop at the worst price you will accept and the limit at $0. A limit is always filled at the limit or better, *whichever is better*, so if you want to fill at the stop price or as close to the stop as possible, your best chance is with a limit at $0. Or work you way up from $0 to a more reasonable price, if you think a sharp drop is unlikely. For example, if you bought a call for $5 and you want to stop at $4, you can set the limit for a stop-limit at $2. The lower you set the limit, the less risk there is that a sharp drop will leave your order unfilled. But that doesn't mean you will only get $2. You'll get the best price that is above $2.\n\nEDIT: You should be skeptical of any use of \"always\" or \"never\" in the context of option trading, including everything I wrote above. Experienced traders with thousands of trades under their belts will rightly scoff at the idea that you should never use market orders. So let me qualify my exhortation by saying that with enough experience and in the right circumstances, like day trading highly liquid contracts, market orders are not only acceptable, the may be the most cost effective alternative.\n\nWhat about liquidity?\n=====================\n\nLiquidity is a little hard to define for all cases, since it is somewhat context dependent. The relevant [Investopedia definition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidity.asp) is \"liquidity describes the degree to which an asset can be quickly bought or sold in the market at a price reflecting its ... value.\" Put another way, the better liquidity is, the better deal you'll get from a market maker. The worse liquidity is, the more you will be ripped off by trading with a market maker.\n\nThe width of the bid/ask spread is highly correlated to the liquidity of a contract, to the point where we can say that the bid/ask spread represents the liquidity of the contract. The volume and open interest are also factors in liquidity, but in practice while trading, where liquidity hits you the most is in the bid/ask spread. As a gross oversimplification, the width of the bid/ask spread is the mark-up a market maker adds to the wholesale value of a contract. The wider the spread, the more of a premium you will pay as a buyer in order to own the contract, or the more of a discount you will have to offer as a seller to get a fill.\n\nThere is also an analogy to competition. Consider something highly perishable that can't be easily shipped from Amazon, like live aquarium goldfish. If there are five pet stores in town, you have a pretty good chance of getting a good price on a pair of goldfish that you want to buy, because each pet store knows you can go to the one down the street to get a better price. The competition helps keep prices down as a buyer, because some store can always undercut another store on price, until price reaches an equilibrium that's close to it's wholesale value plus a reasonable mark-up. But if there is only one pet store in town and the next store is more than a 3 hour drive away, your local store can gouge you on price for a pair of goldfish, because where else are you going to go for a better price?\n\nOptions liquidity works similarly. If volume is low or zero, where are you going to go for a better price? Bid/ask spread can be as wide as market makers want it to be, because there is no one else to undercut those prices. Whereas if volume is high, there is more incentive to undercut competitors and close a trade, because a little money is better than no money if no trades happen, from the market maker's perspective.\n\nThe upshot of all this is that when you are looking for options to trade, select underlyings that have highly liquid option chains. Given an expiration or strike with low volume and wide bid/ask spreads versus a different expiration or strike with high volume and narrow bid/ask spreads, choose the one with high volume and narrow bid/asks.", "id": "maufwg", "created_utc": 1616437702.0, "score": 944, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 153, "comments": [{"body": "Good post, though you typo'd \"sharp\" as \"shart\" in there.

I used to post DD for the week from my personal notebook each week back in 2019, I had thousands of people waiting each Sunday for those DD posts. Someone contacted my wife/tried to doxx me on the street, it freaked me out, I deleted the old account (SoRefreshing). I'm not a shill, or a bear, or any of that shit. I work for myself and trade at home now. I'll start my DD up again when the GME shit dies down, I can't do the posts because: I would instantly get labeled a shill or distraction or a hedgie or some stupid other fucking shit which is the reason for this post.\n\n**In short:** The people here that have been around pre-GME or especially pre 2019 probably share the same sentiment that they're sick of $GME. It's not because of the quality/length of time this has been a phenomenon here, or even the trade itself, we love when stocks do what it is doing because many of us play both sides and make money in both directions, but we hate it **because of the absolutely cultish and ridiculous behavior of some of the people trading it.**\n\nPersonally, I think it should be an instantly temp-bannable offense to do some of the shit in this thread so that we can start cleaning up the ridiculous cultish behavior but whatever, you apes do you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Right Reasons To Be In $GME:\n\n1. **You like the turnaround story, and are willing to hold years to see it come to fruition.** This would be considered an investment, something almost nobody around here has experience with.\n2. **You are simply gambling to gamble, and like the stock.** Sure, buy it up, you're going to have some juicy loss porn if you never sell (and if you're retarded enough to not sell at $500+ and again at $300+ honestly you deserve it)\n3. **You like to not be left out.** I get it, everybody is buying it, so you bought some. Whatever, we've all done it. This is a stupid reason but exponentially better than the shit the new normies spread around the daily Financial Jonestown thread (stolen from another WSBer, credit for the person that claims it idk who it was)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Wrong Reasons To Be in GME:\n\n1. **You think a squeeze is coming to $10,000.** It isn't. People should literally get instabanned for saying this shit because there are people stupid enough to believe it. Granted, that's their bad for being so stupid, but this won't happen (I expand on that below) mostly because the system CANNOT let it happen. You're playing a rigged game, get over it.\n2. **You think you're bankrupting hedge funds.** You're not. They'll get a bailout if you do, or another one of their buddies will step in and cannibalize them. Stop being silly.\n3. **You have any personal vendetta or motive.** It's stupid to trade on emotions. Do it if you want, keep telling people you're holding but stop attacking people that sell or have a contrarian idea. Believe it or not: **Not selling at $300+ or $250 and having it crash back down to $40 with the heavy ass bags you have isn't badass, it's ridiculous. We're here to make money.** Even if you believe the turnaround -- it's stupid. I love some of my holdings but if they gain a pile in a short time, I take some profit off the table because I want to be a boyfriend and not a cuck some day.\n4. **If you think every drop is a \"short ladder\" or \"short attack\".** Some people just sell their shares. Some people need the money and they shouldn't be investing in $GME if so but, that's life.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRanting and explanations of some of the points:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **There's no massive squeeze coming, ever. The best you can hope for is to crush individual shorts into adding volume when they buy back,** but the hedge funds aren't the ones you're beating up on. Citadel will win the war in the end because they can stay liquid longer than all of the holdings in $GME combined. **More importantly, if they're still in, they're hedged, you can guarantee it. Gabe almost got the fund torched,** but he got a bailout from his buddies. Listen, they won't let it happen, it WILL NOT HAPPEN. If you are playing this for a squeeze, then you are in it for the WRONG REASONS. If the first run up to $500+ didn't get shorts out, then they re-shorted at $500 and covered lower. You can be guaranteed shorts that didn't are operational shorts (to hedge put contracts, hedge fund, **hedge**) and play into the price almost not at all. In the impending run up to $300+ recently, the shorts likely cycled again, people covering, and re-shorting. This will lead to compoundingly low highs as people are more likely to cover to not get caught under a squeeze. Each time it happens, it will gain less momentum, what you're seeing is weeks of consolidation into a price range driven by algos and the apes here with money. **$100,000 or even $1,500 a share** from a squeeze is a **COMPLETE meme.** If it hits those price levels, it's for sure massive whales playing games against each other, not because you're bankrupting hedge funds. To double from $500 to $1,000 takes another DOUBLE of the market cap. Today, at around $185 the cap sits at $13B give or take. To double to $370 would require $13B of inflows. Each time it goes up, it exponentially gets harder for retail to have impact on the price but also for it to continue going up. Institutions - because of their fiduciary responsibility - aren't buying this to put in client portfolios. More importantly, the higher it goes up, the more likely a fund has to rebalance the fund's holdings (IE: liquidate literally millions of shares) since one stock would then provide too much risk and they have a responsibility to take profits. The entire system is designed to work against squeezes like the VW one (which is awesome to talk about, but a completely different time, and different situation than we face now.) It's just not happening.\n2. **The second time it ran from $40 up to $100+ was not retail volume.** This easily could have been a massive short from $500+ closing it out and riding up call contracts during their closeout. It could have just been a complete bait. There's a reason it floated around back at $40 when the algos turned off. Some days when you watch the price action the volume is dead, the price isn't jumping up and down rapidly, this is a sign there's less machines trading it. HFT firms likely jumped back on board when it got super volatile because that's when they make the most money, by scalping the spread. You could literally just be at the mercy of machines fighting each other right now, this could be some retail volume but the slow bleed from $330 to $180 then the crash after earnings leads me to believe it's far less retail and more algos playing the momentum. Sure, some of you are buying shares, but I think you are really over-estimating the amount of shares people have and the impact we have on this.\n3. **There is no fucking movement.** This is the biggest one I think. You aren't in this together with anyone and you should stop with the \"hold HOLD!\" shit to other people. You're in this alone, either you're in it to make money, or you're in it for the wrong reasons. You're not putting a real dent into hedge funds, stop being fucking ignorant if you aren't doing it just for the dank memes. I know a guy that killed himself over money in the market, someone telling him to \"HOLD\" on a play, and he lost it all. Tell people you're holding, tell people you think it's stupid to sell, but knock off the shit with massively downvoting people that sell or telling people that sold to fuck off, etc. This is what annoys people from this sub that built the culture the most. Chances are 80% of the people playing this are doing so with money they can't afford to lose - if they choose to share their loss porn then they deserve the needle and should be prepared to accept it, if not, then you're in this ALONE.\n4. **There's no fucking shills.** Not everyone that is contrarian to your confirmation bias is a shill. CNBC isn't in cahoots to spread FUD, there is a lot of veterans on Wall Street that have seen exactly what is going on before, multiple times. Just because they say the valuation is ridiculous doesn't mean they're missing anything. Real statistics showing 20% short interest instead of 100%+ aren't shills, they're just telling you the truth. It already squeezed. We just know this is a fucking pump and dump of gigantic proportions. It may not be today, it may not be tomorrow, but this mother fucker is coming piling back down (for a second time) and some of you are going to hold some very, very heavy bags. There's no way around it.\n5. **You guys are just playing a big game of chicken with each other.** If you're willing to do that, fine, but this is just a $13B pump and dump. Some unnamed institution may be buying up shares to push the price up, especially today, since they have a vested interest in the at the market offering sale in order to raise capital for GameStop and generate revenue for themselves. I won't name the name because you can go hunt it down if you want to know.\n6. **The turnaround is priced in.** Believe it or not, when a company goes from a <$1B market cap to $13B if it holds these price levels, the turnaround is completely priced in an you could buy leap puts and it's printing money, who knows what amount, but it's printing money. Also: turnarounds like the one Cohen is executing take YEARS, not weeks, not months. You won't see appreciable movement in the numbers (which matter, whether you believe it or not) for years. Plus they're massively restructuring, and the chance GameStop still fails is a lot higher than people here give credit to. They need to drastically shift their business, and I believe they will, but it's not even 50/50. It's probably 70/30 that the business still fails completely, regardless how long you HODL your stock.\n\nYeah that's all I have. I'm just tired of the cultish shit coming from $GME people. A lot of us who say that shit or tease you in the $GME daily thread are just doing so because we hate the way this sub is transforming into some ridiculous GME sized version of the \"LET ME INNN\" meme.\n\nAt some point, it's just too much. I know others have hit their point, and I hit mine, so I made this post. Stop giving advice or doing DD posts if you have no fucking clue because you're not doing yourself a favor just by getting upvotes for confirmation bias. I just saw a guy point at declining volume on a DD post as proof that people are shorting downticks. Like what, the, fuck.\n\nJust because you've been here a couple months and lost/made 100k doesn't make you a market expert. You're just a brainless mush clicking buttons like most people here.\n\nI have puts right now. Yeah, I think it's gonna crash, no they don't expire this week, or next, or the one after, so I have plenty of time to wait. I'm already so far green and others are from playing both sides of this trade up and down there is no motive in this post as far as wanting you to sell for my puts, that doesn't matter to me in the scheme of things.\n\nIt's that I really used to love this place, and now it's fucking mind numbingly difficult to put up with it for more than a few minutes until I come across a post like: \"Why is it going down\" or \"Should I sell\" or \"$GME BABY FUCK EVEYONE ELSE SHILL SHILL SHILL\".\n\nLike, fuck, grow up, make some money, fuck you if you do, and fuck you if you don't.\n\nEnjoy your nights.", "id": "mdhjr0", "created_utc": 1616736461.0, "score": 69, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "num_comments": 160, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 100, "replies": [{"body": "Haha THIS!
