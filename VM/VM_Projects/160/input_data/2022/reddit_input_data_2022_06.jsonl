{"title": "Jesse Livermore. The most legendary trader you never heard of.", "selftext": "At the age of 14, his father pulled him out of school to help with the farm; however, with his mother's blessing, Livermore ran away from home. In 1891, at the age of 14, he secured employment, as a board boy, posting stock quotes at a Boston, Massachusetts branch of Paine Webber stockbrokerage, at the rate of $5 per week. \n\nIn 1892, at the age of 15, he bet $5 on Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad at a bucket shop, a type of establishment that took leveraged bets on stock prices but did not buy or sell the stock. He earned $3.12 on the $5 bet.\n\nAt the age of 16, he quit his job and began trading full-time. He brought $1,000 home to his mother, who disapproved of his \"gambling\"; he countered that he was not gambling, but \"speculating\".\n\nFrom 1895‚Äì1897, age 18‚Äì20, he accumulated $10,000 trading profits, a 1,000 per cent net return in three years of trading.\n\nOn September 14, 1900, age 23, he moved to New York, arriving in time for a strong bull market in stocks. He traded successfully, on the long side, at Harris, Hutton & Company stockbrokers, turning $10,000 into $50,000 in five days. In May 1901, he anticipated a correction and went short, using 400% margin. He lost his entire stake.\n\nHis first big win came in 1901 at the age of 24 when he bought stock in Northern Pacific Railway. He turned $10,000 into $500,000.\n\nIn the Panic of 1907, Livermore's huge short positions made him $1 million in a single day. However, his mentor, J. P. Morgan, who had bailed out the entire New York Stock Exchange during the crash, requested him to refrain from further short selling. Livermore agreed and instead, profited from the rebound, boosting his net worth to $3 million.\n\nIn 1908, he listened to Teddy Price, who told him to buy cotton, while Price secretly sold. He went bankrupt but was able to recover all of his losses. \n\nIn 1915, he filed bankruptcy again.\n\nIn 1924‚Äì1925, he engaged in market manipulation, making $10 million trading wheat and corn in a battle with Arthur W. Cutten and engineering a short squeeze on the stock of Piggly Wiggly.\n\nIn early 1929, he amassed huge short positions, using more than 100 stockbrokers to hide what he was doing. By the spring, he was down over $6 million on paper. However, upon the Wall Street Crash of 1929, he netted approximately $100 million. Following a series of newspaper articles declaring him the \"Great Bear of Wall Street\", he was blamed for the crash by the public and received death threats, leading him to hire an armed bodyguard.\n\nEventually he lost his fortune and filed bankruptcy for the third time in 1934, listing assets of $84,000 and debts of $2.5 million.\n\nOn November 28, 1940, just after 5:30 pm, Livermore fatally shot himself with an Automatic Colt Pistol in the cloakroom of The Sherry-Netherland hotel in Manhattan.\n\nInfo from https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Livermore", "id": "vaojua", "created_utc": 1655048321.0, "score": 428, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 150, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|20|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|339|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vaojua)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vaojua)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Wow.

{"title": "Oil crash incoming. TADAWUL vs OIL.", "selftext": "Have all of you paid attention to the Saudi TADAWUL index, which correlates (that is, rises and falls) depending on what happens to oil prices? If you haven‚Äôt paid attention, then I‚Äôll probably reveal some of the chips in this matter to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, now almost all American invest. banks are taking out significant upsides on oil (they say that the potential for oil growth can be up to $ 150 - 170 per barrel), but moreover, this annoys me from the side that this message is addressed to the broad market. Since the \"crowd is not worthy of profit\", and it is always fooled by the market. I refer to the fact that before the future fin. crisis, oil is unlikely to cost $170 per barrel. Maybe $130 - 140 will show on the pull up, but higher growth potential seems unlikely.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, there will soon be a significant bias in favor of supply in the oil market (that is, many market participants will sell more oil than is required), thereby the price will be dumped down. China and India are the main movers in the oil market in the next 6-8 months. But then everything will settle down and return to normal, thus oil will continue to grow after the crisis.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThirdly, if the TADAWUL index falls and the price of oil rises, this is at least a signal that huge market participants are dumping positions to ordinary investors who fall for the trick of investing. banks and buy shares of oil and gas companies and other commodities at mid-term highs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWill there be a collapse in oil prices? Yes, it will be within the framework of the future financial crisis! Will there be a decrease in inflation in the world? Yes, it will be, indirectly the market is already betting on this event by selling shares of oil and gas companies. But will the decline in inflation be long-term? No, this is a local crisis phenomenon marked by the economy entering a deflationary (crisis) spiral, that is, commodity prices will fall as part of a recession, and thus inflation will decrease in the short term. It should also be borne in mind that the Fed is sleeping and sees how to launch economic stimulus programs as soon as possible as part of a loose monetary policy so that US stock indices again begin to desperately grow in the financial. doping, so the growth of inflation in the future on the factor of an inherent increase in commodity prices is doomed!\n\nAlso, pay attention to the new cover of The Economist, they noted in it that in the near future the whole world will experience all the negativity of the energy crisis. IMO this is a clear sign of the top.\n\nWhat all this will lead to? Inflation will be tamed for a while, but since the economy will be limping there will another round of QE which lead to even greater inflation and the oil prices will go up even higher. The coming years will be brutal.\n\nFor now, for the love of God do not go long on energy, it is extremely risky.  \n\n\nP.S.  It is just my theory lol, I don't know anything for sure. I am as retarded as any of you. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8eh82hbky791.jpg?width=973&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e022b8a5c2ee35737c53784b6564739bc6f8b16", "id": "vl3kuo", "created_utc": 1656246162.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 151, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|2 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|56|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vl3kuo)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vl3kuo)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "the parabolic move in oil doesn't necessarily mean it will \"crash\" like it did in 08. oil can actually stay elevated for years (i.e. crude prices stayed above 100 for 4 fucking years from 11\\~14), which is why simply shorting parabolic moves can fuck you.\n\ni disagree and actually think there's a good chance oil will stay \\~100/bbl for a while  without a crash. demand destruction isn't seen at these prices even with a coin toss of a recession., supply constraint will occur for the unforeseeable future (i.e. rus vs ukraine), china is reopening, hostile US nations will keep it elevated to fuck the US for as long as possible.", "score": 61, "replies": [{"body": "Even at 90 a barrel most large oil and gas companies are trading at a huge discount to valuation right now.

I'm at about $20k now with that original investment, but the money is in good positions when the market shifts again.\n\nI have found certain data is decently telling for general trends, and I either make the choice to follow that data or not.  When I don't, I tend to lose money.  When I work with the data, I do pretty good.  However, the data never tells you how much potential is available, and the big gains come from the crazy bets.  For data, I'm very simple.  I watch weighted moving averages and direction indicators.  These tend to be decently reliable on behavior on a macro level.  And if you're not doing day stuff, it flows pretty well.  There are few surprises following this data.  And it can be decent enough to indicate larger trend changes a week or two in advance.\n\nThere are plays where you can double your money overnight, but it's a bit of guessing if the market will bite and generate anything actually appreciable.  One bet on a stock might see 20%, but the same kind of bet following the same metrics for another might yield 200%.  You throw your money behind one and not the other, and sometimes you bet on the wrong one.  You walk with 20% and watch the 200% come and disappear.  I still have no clue how the market reacts so differently.  There's a stock just recently that I was watching that was in a good position for big gains.  I didn't put any money in and saw it double.  But I've also doubled other bets and watch others do nothing.  It's a big faff kind of, and I more so find the reliable plan is to sort of work a spread and pull any gains early and then manage any stagnant/loss stocks.  With those you're either waiting for the jump or backing out when they don't.  Then again, I've waited two months on a stock before, to back out after two months of nothing, and then watching it jump 200% the week after.\n\nThe day trading (or nearly) is just a lot of busy work where I find it to be a lot of fuss over little value.  Sometimes it's easier just to dump money in reliable stuff and just let it ride.  That also turns sour when the market becomes a bear.  Oh well...  Still, you just buy the sales and watch it all rise again on market change.\n\nNow where's that bull?\n\nI'm assuming we have at least a few more months.", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": ">My biggest losses were chasing runs and then forgetting about it for like a month thinking they'll just keep going and not getting out of the market when the market went bear.\n\nI've had some like that.

{"title": "Lehman 2.0: How SocGen and Credit Suisse Will Bring Down the Financial System", "selftext": "  \n\nSoci√©t√© G√©n√©rale, or SocGen, and Credit Suisse hold over $2.5 trillion (USD) in assets and are two of the top banks in Europe. Both are part of Tier-1 of the G-SIBs, or Globally Systematic Important Banks (alongside Morgan Stanley, Wells Fargo, and others, just to give some perspective on size and importance. The G-SIBs rankings were established in 2011, and mean that these banks are essentially to big to fail, until they do.\n\nWe will start with the big picture. European banks in general are under critical stress. The Euro is collapsing, energy prices are skyrocketing, and assets held within Russia are largely lost forever.   On top of this, the European Central Bank (ECB) is raising rates for the first time in over a decade. Let me make it clear that there was a reason Europe decided to go to negative rate territory. If they had not, there would have been mass defaults, a major recession, and there would have essentially been no recovery from the Financial Crisis. The whole Euro Zone would have been decimated. Maybe something positive would have come out of this, maybe not, but leaders in Europe and the ECB decided to sacrifice the future for the present, and unfortunately now we are in the future.\n\nSocGen has always had significantly risky practices, ala Lehman Brothers[. In fact, Lehman said in January 2008 that the fraud uncovered at SocGen was ‚Äúeveryone‚Äôs worst nightmare.‚Äù ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-davos-socgen-lehman-1/socgen-case-everyones-worst-nightmare-lehman-ceo-idUSFLE43779720080124) Irony abounds. Following this, [SocGen absorbed a bunch of ex-Lehman staff](https://www.fx-markets.com/people/1555950/ex-lehman-fx-sales-team-reunited-at-socgen) and continued what they do best: overleveraging, defrauding, and [money laundering](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2021-11-30/u-s-ends-societe-generale-sanctions-case-after-bank-complies-with-agreement) for the world‚Äôs elite criminals. This kind of business model works well when it is working, but when a perfect storm hits, it‚Äôs an absolute fiasco. \n\nCredit Suisse is not much different. [This article from February pretty much sums up everything you need to know about Credit Suisse.](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/20/credit-suisse-secrets-leak-unmasks-criminals-fraudsters-corrupt-politicians) As if we are living in a sick joke, they named Axel Lehmann their head of their risk committee last year, who is now their chairman. Unlike US banks which recovered after the financial crisis, Credit Suisse is still down 92% from the highs and is down over 40% this year. SocGen has had a similar downwards trajectory.\n\nNow, onto the perfect storm. Since January 2021, the Euro is down 12% against the USD. That may not seem like a lot, but you must understand that currency markets move very slowly until something is fundamentally wrong on one side of the currency pair.  Currency traders use significant leverage (sometimes as much as 1000:1) to make trades, and multi-percent moves can cause a lot of collateral damage. Fast-forward to 2022 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Credit Suisse, SocGen, and essentially every other bank in Europe had significant risk exposure to Russia and Russian banks, as they all had done business on a regular basis. The sanctions that were put on Russia caused significant FX volatility along with a massive spike in energy prices, which both contributed to the energy inflation Europe is seeing which far outpaces the US. There was already some restructuring going on at Credit Suisse, which did not help. Here is a table for bank comparison:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t3fghfz7vt891.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba414dd2dd9b875335525092dfbc644f406217dd\n\n[https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/credit-suisse-risks-losing-business-amid-overhaul-8211-analysts-70621128](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/credit-suisse-risks-losing-business-amid-overhaul-8211-analysts-70621128)\n\nAnd here is a more ominous chart:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ghq2lo8vt891.png?width=425&format=png&auto=webp&s=c625a586c255e176ab9d9a22ee6d3247a4eaa626\n\nSaid bluntly, Credit Suisse is ALREADY operating at a deficit, before the ECB raises rates. The ECB raising rates will cause significant loan defaults. \n\nNow, for SocGen. I work with UHNW individuals and constantly price out structured products. Structured products are largely a game for the wealthy to ensure an income while limiting significant risk in the markets, but there is always counterparty risk. What this means is that banks write these structured products, and the risk premium is in part determined by the ability of the counterparty bank, the bank that is writing the note, staying solvent. When Lehman was nearing the end and internal employees knew it, they wrote a ton of notes such as principal protection notes that ‚Äúensured‚Äù investors could not lose, unless Lehman, a prestigious bank of over 150 years, went out of business.\n\nFastforward to last week. This hits my inbox at work. A note, written by SocGen, essentially guaranteeing a return over 20%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2znqwav9vt891.png?width=1069&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3462e44af8cf0d727ca6bd36c8125a3d394a79b\n\nHere is what was written alongside this note:\n\nHighest Max Return: **31.25%**\n\nLowest Max Return: **24.30%**\n\nUnderlying: **SPX**\n\nIssuer: **Soc Gen**\n\nStrike Date: **6/16**\n\nNotional: **$1,000,000**\n\nI have never seen a note like this hit my inbox, and I have already written previously about SocGen and its risky structured note behavior. It is coming full circle.\n\nThese businesses are going to get crushed over the next three months. What Europe is facing is much more dire than what the United States is facing; There are countries in Europe that can‚Äôt pay back their debt, never mind businesses and consumers. The ECB has to raise rates, if they do not inflation will topple governments. The challenge will be if the result becomes so unstable that the entire European Union collapses, and countries such as Germany return to their own currencies, sending the Euro spiraling downwards.\n\nThere are hundreds of other data points that should be in this report, and please feel free to comment with them because this is all beyond fascinating. \n\n**Puts, shorts, and anything else betting against Credit Suisse and SocGen are good plays, especially over the next six months.** \n\n***We are going to see some fireworks ladies and gentlemen.***", "id": "vojmtj", "created_utc": 1656625094.0, "score": 537, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 158, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|25|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|37|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vojmtj/lehman_20_how_socgen_and_credit_suisse_will_bring/) \n**Account Age**|1 month|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vojmtj)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vojmtj)\n    \nHey /u/3xinvesting, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "That is not how a structured note works.

In theory, you could craft a structured note yourself, but you‚Äôd have to manage the options hedging every day yourself.\n\nThe payoff is built into how the note is structured. Income producing notes utilize digital options within the package to create the payment stream. Participation notes utilize calls to create upside leverage. You can create really complex and unique payoffs outside of these vanilla examples.\n\nThe fee structure is somewhat opaque, but there‚Äôs been rules created in recent years to force issuers to list more and more within their docs. The issuer has a PnL built into the structuring of the product, this is set by their internal treasury desk. There can also be small structuring fees. When you purchase through a wholesaler, they‚Äôll also add their fee into the structure, this ranges across wholesalers, but has generally gotten tighter and sits around 0-40bps lately.\n\nIt depends on who is selling it.

Long story short, we had difficulty evaluating these banks. I don‚Äôt want to go into further detail, but I just remember looking at banks like SocGen and feeling I must be missing SOMETHING considering the vast size of the bank and how risky it seemed to be operating based on their financials. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt far off.\n\nEdit: Just did some research on PPNs and I think the ‚Äúlowest max return‚Äù is a bit misguiding. From my understanding, it seems that if you choose to participate at minimum exposure, your potential max return would be the 24%. If the SPX has a negative return from now until maturity (36 months), an investor would receive their principal only. Seems like a shady way of raising debt without bearing interest imo and the ‚Äúlowest max return‚Äù is just a way for sell side to make it sound like a less shitty investment. The only purpose I can think of for investing in these notes would be if your firm wasn‚Äôt allowed to directly invest in equity, like a commercial bank. However, I guarantee regulators wouldn‚Äôt allow a commercial bank to buy these notes lol", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "buttcoin here we come.
