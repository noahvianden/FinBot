I have a portfolio that is 100% growth stocks and I’ve taken some time to look at valuations to evaluate if I have companies that seem to be over their skis in terms of valuation.\n\nI’ve been looking at lots of stocks in terms of reverse dfc and it seems to me that MercadoLibre is undervalued by about 50%.  They are still growing sales by more than 30% y/y and are improving their operating margin by increasing take rates and reducing costs.  They turn out outstanding results quarter after quarter and when faced with competitive threats from players such as Amazon and Shopee, they just keep coming out on top.\n\nI have a somewhat focused portfolio of 9 stocks, but with the numbers I’m seeing, I just really want to put everything into MercadoLibre (not that I have a big portfolio - just around 30k)\n\nEvery other growth stock I evaluate seems either overvalued or reasonably valued, taking into account ten years of reasonable growth assumptions.  Take Nvidia for example.  I own Nvidia and based on my reverse DCF, if they can grow FCF by 30% for ten years, the stock is currently fairly valued.  I think they might be able to pull that off, so Nvidia might be worth owning.\n\nBut according to the same model, MercadoLibre only needs to grow FCF 11% annually over the next 10 years to justify their current valution.  This just seems like an absurdly low bar for them.\n\nIf my model is off, it would be off in the same direction for all the companies im evaluating.  Part of me thinks I should just invest in this one company that has both amazing fundamentals and low valuation.  Another part of me is just saying “hell no!  Always stay diversified!”\n\nIt’s like Cramer vs Munger in my head.  One voice says “5 stocks minimum”. The other says, “why buy anything but your best idea?”  Peter Lynch is also in my head.  I live in Mexico and use Mercado Libre’s services, so it’s a company I can get behind on a personal level.

I live in Brazil and I am a regular Mercado Libre customer (here it's called Mercado Libre, in Portuguese. But it's the same company). Brazil is one of the largest markets Mercado Libre operates, if not the largest. So being a regular Mercado Libre customer in Brazil for the past 5 years I would say I can have a fairly good insight on its moat from the customer perspective.\n\nHere Mercado Libre has beaten the concurrency for the past 5 years or so. Amazon has not half the popularity of mercado Libre, simply because Mercado Libre has built a high customer base throughout the years and also because most of the sellers are on Mercado Livre, but few are on Amazon. Mercado livre is the one stop place for technical equipment in any field, from dentistry to sound equipment. Huge variety and great customer support. So far, that would be a great moat.\n\nBut recently there is a crucial aspect of Mercado Libre's customer relations that is making me think the current management is not as cautious as it has been in the past: Brazilians (and probably customers for other countries too) are simply being unable to connect to their accounts on desktop computers. A malfunction on their login system on browsers makes it almost impossible to use your account. The only way to access your account as a customer is by the mobile app. There is no 2 step authentication and no way to use your phone to login on your desktop. It's simply not possible for Brazilian customers to login on their accounts if they attempt it using a PC. The Brazilian internet is full of complaints about it and it has been going on for a very long time. So it's certainly not something that is affecting few users, it's widespread. And Mercado Libre never addressed this issue.\n\nWhile this may seem a trivial issue, I'd say it's a red flag. A company that has conquered a great portion of the market that suddenly incurs in such carelessness may or may not keep growing. I think it's just too many people complaining for the company to ignore it. \n\nAmazon has not half the variety of sellers that you find on Mercado Libre. But Amazon has fast delivers, and a great user interface. I myself created a recently an account on Amazon to search for stuff I could not buy on Mercado Libre because I could not access my account. In the end I used mercado Libre on my phone and made the purchase. But this was simply due to the price: it was cheaper on Mercado Libre. But I wonder how many other frustrated customers created their account on Amazon and bought from Amazon instead from buying from Mercado Libre.\n\nWhen you're shopping for expensive technical equipment you want to use your desktop browser, so you can open many tabs at the same time, compare vendors, prices and products within Mercado Libre vast inventory. But if you are pushing your customers to Amazon by preventing them from using their accounts on their desktop in the Brazilian market, you must have something wrong with administration.\n\nIf this was something that had been spotted and solved quickly, most people would not even notice the issue. But it has been going on for more than a year. According to.the older posts I've seen. And this is terrible for customers of technical equipment, a segment that Mercado Libre excels.\n\nSo this raises a red flag on whether the current administration is going to sink Mercado Libre. I think this is a red flag because it is an indication of mismanagement. What If be does start switching to Amazon to recover their customers?\n\nI would not regard Mercado Libre as a long-term investment. I don't believe on its moat and that is what Amazon needs to take its place. And you will not see info on how many vendors may have opened stores on Amazon on Mercado Libre's reports. It's a very important thing that can't be on the reports. You must know the market to realize this. And this is very dangerous for Mercado Libre.\n\nI do think it's currently undervalued but I also think it may not perform well in the future if it's giving away its customer base.

A business takes time to execute and the stock price can move in completely different directions to the performance of the company, case and point yesterday’s price action. If you don’t understand what you bought, it’ll cause uncertainty and panic. So to say “if no change” is quite misleading. The stock price didn’t change but the business changed. That is wonderful for patient investors that want to buy into ownership of a business. Another example is $BN. The company is absolutely excelllent but this year, the stock price barely changed. I’m only up 11% on $BN year-to-date. But it doesn’t matter that the stock barely moved compared to the rest of asset management businesses such as $KKR because I actually want my businesses to have their stock price “no change” while the business continues to execute so I can keep buying more for cheaper. You must know what you own otherwise you’ll do foolish things “if no change.” On another topic, if you don’t believe in a company that you bought, the worst thing you can do is wait for it to bounce up so you can sell at break-even. You don’t even believe in the company so why would you trust it will eventually bounce?

{"title": "The everything bubble and why it can’t be blown up again.", "selftext": "INTRO\nI bring you a story, a story of how the FED and its economic policies have doomed the economy ,a recession and a bear market is lurking on the horizon like has never before been seen.To Convince you of my theory , and to break it down , I will be splitting this DD into 3 parts .\n\n\n1. The Everything Bubble \n\n2. The coming long-run slowdown in corporate profit growth and stock returns.\n(why it can’t be blown up again)\n\n3.How did this happen?\n\n\nPART ONE \nTHE EVERYTHING BUBBLE AND WHAT IS IT. \n\n1. What is a bubble? \n\nAn economic bubble is a period when current asset prices greatly exceed their intrinsic valuation, being the valuation that the underlying long-term fundamentals justify.\n\n2. Okay, so what is the everything bubble?\n\nThe expression \"everything bubble\" refers to the correlated impact of monetary easing by the Federal Reserve (and followed by the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan)on asset prices in most asset classes, namely equities, housing, bonds, many commodities, and even exotic assets such as cryptocurrencies and SPACs.The term is related to the Fed put, being the tools of direct and indirect quantitative easing that the Fed used to execute the monetary easing, and to modern monetary theory, which advocates the use of such tools, even in non-crisis periods, to create economic growth through asset price inflation.\n\nTo put it simply , the federal reserve and the banks have irresponsibly used Quantitative easing and the Fed Put to flood the market with cash , artificially creating expanded asset prices in every sector. \n\n3. Are there examples of this so called bubble?\n(Due to Reddit issues , this section will be in the comments )\n\n\n4. How do you identify a bubble?\n\nTraditional approaches to detect stock price bubbles rely on historical data. Past prices are used to estimate the fundamental value of an asset. A bubble is then identified by the difference (if any) between the price observed in the market and the estimated fundamental value.\n\n\nNewer approaches use option pricing to be able to determine in real time if there is a bubble in the underlying asset , a few examples of this here.\n\nhttps://hub.jhu.edu/2021/03/16/model-detects-stock-bubbles-in-real-time/\n\n\nWe can use both the traditional and modern approaches to look at the s&p and determine if we are in a bubble ,\n\n\nFirst the traditional approach \n\nWhile it's indeed important to remember that no valuation measure is near perfect , I do believe that the Shiller P/E is a reasonable method.\nThe main advantage of the Shiller PE ratio is that it eliminates the fluctuations in the regular PE ratio caused by variations in profit margins during business cycles. The regular PE uses the trailing 12 months earnings per share (EPS).\nThe Shiller P/E gives investors a read on whether the stock market—as represented by the S&P 500—is overvalued or undervalued. The higher the Shiller P/E ratio, the more overvalued a market.\nFor context, over more than 100 years, the average and median Shiller P/E ratio has been around 15 or 16, spiking up significantly higher often before market crashes.\n the all-time high in the Shiller P/E ratio was December 1999, when the figure reached 44.19. This high coincided with the dot-com driven rally in tech stocks of the late 1990s. Based in part on that record high ratio, Shiller correctly predicted that the dot-com frenzy would turn out to be a bubble.\n\nHere is the chart\n\nhttps://www.longtermtrends.net/sp500-price-earnings-shiller-pe-ratio/\n\n\nThe current shiller P/E ratio is 30.64 although in 2021 reaching a staggering 39 , the average being around 16.5 indicating a very overvalued market, for historical context, The only other times where the ratio has been higher was the 2000.com bubble at 44 which left the market relatively flat for the next decade ,and the Great Depression in the 1920s.\n\n\nFor the Modern approach \nI recommend looking at this study below \n\nhttps://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2021/08/05/how-to-predict-a-stock-market-bubble-in-real-time.html\n\nit relies on cross-sectional option price data.\n“It’s simple,” Dr Kwok said. “First, get the sale prices of the stock option contracts at various strike prices. They are useful for uncovering the distribution of discounted future stock prices. Then calculate the fundamental stock value as the average of discounted future stock prices. Subtract this from the observed spot (current) stock prices to obtain bubble estimates.”\n\nWhile the math here is a little above my pay grade , the strategy is back tested multiple times in different studies at different colleges by different experts coming to the same conclusions, their findings were Bubbles were positive and economically significant in the late 1990’s, during 2006-2007 (prior to the GFC), and after mid-2014 to the present day. \n\n\n5. If we are in a bubble, how big is it? \n\nA superbubble is when asset prices are multiples from historical valuations and the average price trend due to extreme speculative conditions. A superbubble in the financial markets is when assets are priced at three-sigma the standard deviation from the historical trend. This is where we are today.\n\nSome examples of previous modern superbubbles in the financial markets are the 1929 stock market crash, the 1970s, and the 2000 dot-com bubble. These events are extreme in historical nature and can see drops in prices of 50% to 90%.\n\nLegendary investor Jeremey Grantham has been publicly saying the US is in a superbubble of stocks, bonds, and real estate for almost a year. He said recently that this bubble has still not really popped. Grantham saw the 1980s Japan stock bubble and the 2008 financial crises coming and warned people of both of them before they occurred so he’s a good source for viewing macroeconomic trends.\n“Only a few market events in an investor’s career really matter, and among the most important of all are super bubbles,” Grantham explains. “These superbubbles are events unlike any others: while there are only a few in history for investors to study, they have clear features in common.”\n“Prepare for an epic finale—If history repeats, the play will once again be a tragedy. We must hope this time for a minor one.” Grantham said.\n“Thus we could say the current event, so far, is looking eerily similar to these other historic super bubbles,” Grantham said. \n\nPT2&3 WILL BE POSTED A DAY LATER AND WILL BE A CONTINUATION OF MY THESIS THIS PART IS JUST TO INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT\n\nPART 2 BELOW\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/5lzhkPRRoY", "id": "16u82bk", "created_utc": 1695881108.0, "score": 219, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 155, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|95|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16u7lpz/test_5/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16u7fo9/test_2/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16u7jna/test_5/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16u7j8r/test_4/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16u7f88/test/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16u7eqq/the_everything_bubble_and_why_it_cant_be_blown_up/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16u7sni/the_everything_bubble_and_why_it_cant_be_blown_up/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/16ewejx/is_the_weed_market_undervalued/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: We’re in a bubble of stocks, bonds, and real estate.
