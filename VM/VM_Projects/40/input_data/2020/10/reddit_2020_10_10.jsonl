{"title": "Nordstrom vs Macy‚Äôs vs Kohl‚Äôs", "selftext": "I‚Äôm currently holding fairly large positions in all of these but am thinking about concentrating on just one of them... The way I see it, of all three Nordstrom has suffered the hardest hit from Covid. They have stylists and tailors etc. They sell fancier clothes and people don‚Äôt need to look fancy as much these days. But I think most pain is already priced in. So, when things go back to normal I also think Nordstrom will recover the most. Nordstrom also has the best off price business.. the Rack. However, Kohl‚Äôs cooperates with Amazon.. Macy‚Äôs is growing a lot online.
