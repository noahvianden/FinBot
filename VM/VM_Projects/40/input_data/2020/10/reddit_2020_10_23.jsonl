{"title": "AI Based Options Contracts Daily Watch list - October 23rd, 2020", "selftext": "Hey folks,\n\nI recently developed a [bot](https://twitter.com/TradyticsAIbot) that uses AI to analyze options flow and predicts directions for individual option contracts. It also tells you whether you should buy to open or sell to open a contract which is something that's not really available anywhere else. And it's 100% free since it's a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/TradyticsAIbot). Here are some alerts from today that I am keeping an eye on tomorrow and the next few days.\n\nBearish means the price of contract will go down while bullish means the price of contract will go up.\n\n# $PINS\n\nI believe both $PINS and [$SNAP](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-Kw0NE-gbjJn-S7H2b-j6jZ7-1VL7D) are a bit overextended right now and need to dip. One of [SNAP](https://www.tradytics.com/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-Kw0NE-gbjJn-S7H2b-j6jZ7-1VL7D) alerts today had a gain of 85%. That is further confirmed by this alert. Bearish on CALL mean either Sell to Open the call or Buy to Open a put.\n\n[Track alert at: https:\\/\\/www.tradytics.com\\/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-U6wco-znVFx-RA167-DSU76-cvHSh](https://preview.redd.it/s138kigzbru51.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=de09683f91d49b720fc53a2db1be3d5e6176a690)\n\n# $SQ\n\nSQ had dipped quite nicely the last few days and it is about to be on a resistance line ([https://i.imgur.com/ow1F4vh.png](https://i.imgur.com/ow1F4vh.png)). This contract seems to have a long expiry and this looks like a good one. Maybe too costly so you can get in on a cheaper one.\n\n[Track alert at: https:\\/\\/www.tradytics.com\\/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-t1xlI-wzasX-Vsip8-sHlJz-eD7fx](https://preview.redd.it/8cb6589ycru51.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1fb92211b9759b788b94db2ced908b0391f07f5)\n\n# $PYPL\n\nPYPL was about to break a good resistance level but failed ([https://i.imgur.com/NG02hoH.png](https://i.imgur.com/NG02hoH.png)). There is another support right below the current price so if we can somehow stay there, this is a good contract. Again, you can go a bit cheaper.\n\n[Track alert at: https:\\/\\/www.tradytics.com\\/bullseye-dashboard?alert=-lmRJF-bA5ZF-h5tE1-1tG13-cWlKf](https://preview.redd.it/v4sf93gddru51.png?width=594&format=png&auto=webp&s=acdca1c06d4f43f92eef21388c1008e41e28e775)\n\nThat's it - I just want to see if there's demand for these daily alerts in the community here.

The people who bought shares for covered options don’t actually want to hold them and dumped them back on the market and other shareholders that buy rumor and sell news dumped too. That’s why Apple stock dumped all last week, lots of people dumping their shares after the event. Tesla has similar overwhelming demand for options that causes share price to bubble and after event prices to fall.

{"title": "SQ", "selftext": "I like Square as a company and see a lot of people are bullish about it. However, a few things stop me from investing. Be interested to hear thoughts but at the moment I am a Square bear. \n\n**Management**\n\nJack Dorsey is a visionary. I don’t think this is controversial. However, his track record at Twitter is worrying for shareholders. Be it daily active user growth, ambition with acquisitions but ultimately failure to monetise a fantastic platform where you have big corporations, celebrities and even the President reaching out to 200m daily active users for free. With Square, the closed loop business model of businesses and consumers is again a fantastic concept that could break the power of Visa/Mastercard. Execution remains to be seen, of course. \n\n**Competition**\n\nSquare operate in a highly competitive field for consumers and businesses. Let’s take consumers based on Square’s fast-growing Cash App. It offers things a normal bank does like deposits, ATM access, money transfer. If it becomes a fully-fledged bank offering loans, credit; it is competing against the likes of big incumbents (e.g. JP Morgan, Bank of America). Granted they’re dinosaur firms but they already have a huge customer base that are older and, therefore, have more money and deposits. This means it is much easier for them to monetise their customers resulting in high ARPU. Why would these lucrative customers, en-masse, want to uproot their finances to Square when their existing providers will be providing the same service by copying Square, as JP Morgan have done this week? [Link](https://www.pymnts.com/smbs/2020/jpmorgan-takes-on-square-and-paypal-at-the-point-of-sale/) \n\nFor businesses, Square’s provides software offering (invoicing, PoS, online store) but face strong competition from the likes of Shopify who are taking a fully integrated service approach to SMEs which allows them to take their business online but also manage all their backend processes, including payments. This is a highly convenient service for entrepreneurs. Shopify already has 6% share of the online retail market. Square also provides hardware products which make it easy for SMEs, in particular, to take payments. However, there is evidence that retail is facing a more permanent shift in the US vs. the rest of the world with 60% less footfall today than a year ago [Link](https://www.spring-board.info/benchmarks/benchmark/daily-footfall). 58% of Square’s GPV is from food/drink, retail and professional services. Square may have good market share but it is a shrinking industry.\n\nAnd as a final piece, competitors in both spaces are generally in very healthy financial shape: Paypal, Shopify, Global Payments, Western Union and big banks are well-capitalised. \n\n**Valuation**\n\nPerhaps you can get over the above with the fact that Square has strong network effects and are able to win customers cheaply. However, in my opinion, Square is priced for perfection. Simply looking at a price/sales metric, it is trading 13x LTM. This is high but maybe relatively reasonable for a fast-growing business. However, 25% of Square’s revenue is accounted by Bitcoin “revenue”. This brings little value to Square (2% gross profit) and even Square themselves discount this revenue in their KPIs because it is “out of their control and not reflective of Square’s performance”. \n\nNow onto profits. It is not fair to be too hard on Square’s profitability. After all, it is in high growth phase and its marketing costs were its highest opex line item at roughly 35% for YTD. However, a cursory look at it is Enterprise Value / EBITDA (forward look to Dec2020), it is 242x. If we give credit for Square’s business plan for a further two years, today’s Enterprise Value over broker consensus forecast EBITDA for 2022, it is still a heady 77x. This is when Square is supposed to have EBITDA of $1bn which is three times more than it is forecast for Dec 2020. Priced to perfection.\n\nIf you compare it to Paypal, it is trading at 39x and 27x EV / EBITDA for Dec 2020 and 2022.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nSquare has formidable backers like Ark Invest. I am also not a great believer in “dumb retail” overvaluing a stock for a prolonged period of time.
