{"title": "Crazy night at the Casino", "selftext": "So I was at the casino picking up some tendies from the smucks at the holdem table and this retard starts talking about his TSLA losses. The retard was up $600 and said he was going to cash out and set it aside for taxes. So he got up and left, I continued my hand, but out of the corner of my eye I see him walk over to the roulette table and bet it all on black. Wouldn't you know, it hits red. This idiot was clearly mad at this point so I had the waitress deliver him some scotch neat on me with a note that said SPY $290p 11/20. He must have looked around the casino for 15 minutes trying to figure out who sent him that.  His wife was livid at this point and he left her there so now she's in bed next to me as I write this. On Monday I will closing a small position to buy her a new set of bolt-ons. \n\nMusk giveth and musk taketh.
