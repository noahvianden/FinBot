{"title": "Help me think of recovery stocks for 2021", "selftext": "So I’m starting to build my thesis and ideas to set positions for 2021. It’s looking like 2021 will be a recovery year and a step into normalcy. What are some stocks that are solid companies with upside to get to where they were pre March 2020? Here’s my list so far.\n\nLUV and SAVE - I think 2021 will be a recovery for travel but mostly domestic. Both of these companies have cash on hand and can operate closer to capacity with domestic. I like them to recover quicker than other airlines LUV still has about $19 upside to get back to pre covid levels and SAVE about $40ish\n\nBUD - I think clubs, events, parties will slowly step in the direction along with restaurants. People will consumer more alcohol This is still about $32 pre covid upside. \n\nSIX - Theme parks opening up again. Sea World and Disney already kind of priced in, although I think Disney will continue to grow. Six Flags still have about $30 from pre covid level upside. \n\nJWN - Although Nordstrom popped today, you still have $15 upside for a solid brand. \n\nDDS - Same as Nordstrom. Dillards has a good following and $30 upside. I think Nordstrom has a better online presence though. \n\nAMC - Risky play here as they don’t have a good balance sheet, but $3 and potentially more upside long term. \n\nCNK - From my understanding, Cinemark has a better balance sheet than AMC and still has about $13 upside. I’m thinking of selling AMC and jumping in this. \n\nJust about all Bank Stocks. All banks are still down good but. The ones I like the most are C, JPM, and BAP. \n\nWhat are some I’m missing?

But is there more to go? MS is topping most price targets I see now. JPM has a high close to $150, but is it getting there in 2021 or is this move to ~$125 the post covid bump?\n\nSPG is another example. Love the stock and bought in around $62. Now it’s hovering between $85-$90, but it’s high was around $150. I’m paralyzed by waiting for a further drop even though there’s still a lot of upside next to pre covid levels.\n\nSo that’s the challenge I see in 2021, deciding how much recovery from lows really constitutes a return to normal and deciding if pre covid levels are a fair baseline.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Throw every penny you have on SQ and JD.
