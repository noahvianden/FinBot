{"title": "Viatris (VTRS) DD: That was fast!", "selftext": "If you don’t give a shit about financials or value or growth potential or whatnot tl;dr is buy shares. All of this is my opinion and should not be believed as fact, do your own research.\n\nHey guys, so today was a little interesting for this company, Viatris. Borne of the Upjohn-Mylan merger I thought it might be fair for me to type this up, as I get to be first and you get to be in on a “new” stock. The plan to return profits to shareholders are to instate a dividend consisting of 25% of free cash flow, after Q4 2020 ends. I’m not gonna go on about the great things Mylan is doing outside of the United States or how Pfizer is making a big fat mistake in selling Upjohn, mostly because I don’t know enough. What I do know, personally, is that costs for designer drugs such as vyvanse are going up crazy amounts year over year, while generic adderall/alprazolam is looking like a much more affordable and appealing medication, to those who need them of course.\n\nAs far as financials, who knows. I’m using 1/8th of Pfizer’s revenue added on to Mylan’s.\n\nMarket cap: Around 20 billion.\n\nMylan had a pretty impressively profitable Q3, surprising some but not me. With total revenue of 2.97 billion and net income of 185 million, they were profitable and grew year over year, and you get to add on roughly 1.35 billion and 150 million, respectively. Pretty good I’d say, and if you look at the previous years Mylan has had, they struggled to hold up their valuation once at an aggressively overbought state… and it’s going to happen again. As 25% of free cash flow, the dividend yield is about 10% of the stocks current price… Which is why the next 3 months will probably lead to a natural growth in the stock price. Or maybe after 3 months? The only 100% wrong answer, is never.\n\nInvesting Strategy:\nAs tempted as I am to sell puts on this stock, I’m not able. This stock is gonna drop mornings, spike very hard, and then finish the day somewhere up very often… We sell calls. I like the April 2021 strike price, pick whatever price you’d be fine with buying the shares at, and then sell weekly covered call against it for maybe 5ish percent a week. After that point you’re gonna want to exercise your calls and hold, collecting the 8ish percent dividend, and then just sell calls & puts on it, because this is the type of 1000 year company you’re gonna remember in 3020. Again all of this is my opinion, but the entire company is - good looks.

My belief is that apple bricking their old phones, hard, is going to absolutely fuck them up. When you look at an iPhone compared to a google pixel, there’s no clear winner... but ones half the price. It’s going to fuck them up a lot more than a 115 million settlement ordered by the government, good ethics are good business. That’s just my opinion, but if I’m to treat investing/time decay as my income source then I’m going to be pretty suspicious of any company over 1 trillion, but apple just has too much to figure out right now. Rest of spy follows, more or less\n\nAs far as raw value I can’t see anything better than weed stocks and particularly aphria as a long term investment... but it helps to keep expectations low because a lot of older, maybe richer people are going to wait a lot longer for that kind of thing before putting their money in even if that’s what they would want to add to their portfolio.

It already has it's foot in the door in every police precinct.  Anyone in sales knows incremental upsells are easier to existing clients. And with a client like the US government and no other competition, it's shooting fish in a barrel.\n\nPLTR also has deep institutional investors.  Anyone not long term on PLTR, ask yourselves what do you think you know that Soros doesn't?\n\nRecently there have been reports of Soros saying he regrets his PLTR position.  How do we know it isn't clearly FUD? There's a chance the only thing he regrets is not buying a larger stake before the WSB meme status bump.\n\n More on Soros, \"Soros has sold all the shares it’s permitted to sell at this time and will keep selling, according to the statement. “SFM does not approve of Palantir’s business practices,” the firm said.\"\n\nWhy is PLTR is sky rocketing with Soros selling? \n\nPer wiki, \"Soros survived German-occupied-Hungary\".  He sees some similarities between our nanny state direction, aided by PLTR, that the US is moving in akin to Nazi occupied Germany.  But just like Nazi Germany, it is too late to stop mass surveillance now, without a 3rd world war.  Which we will win because it will be a cyber war, and the NSA has PLTR.  \n\nBut don't let Soros' apprehension fool you given that Soros has already sold off some of his stake while PLTR continues to sky rocket.  Don't forget that Soros is 90 years old.  After a lifetime of wealth accumulation and ruling over the world, people like him often have \"come to God\" moments. This is a known phenomenon.
