Fear not, I am letting you in on an industry secret. All the big boys use something called AA (Astro-Analysis). \n\nUnlike TA, you have to be extremely intelligent to understand AA. Even Hawkings and Einstein could only settle for astronomy.\n\nAlso unlike TA, AA can only predict long term trends, much like Buffett. Here are the moves for 2020 as I observe the skies. If you don't understand what I'm talking about you will just have to get a PhD in Astro-Analysis from my certified training course for $42069. Sorry guys.\n\n**Facebook, (FB)**: Transiting Jupiter would aspect 5 planets during the year 2020,  including friends Moon, Mars ans Sun. This stock is therefore at the top of my list.\n\n**Biogen, (BIIB)**: Here also transiting Jupiter is aspecting natal Moon, jupiter and Sun. I therefore believe this stock would do good in 2020.\n\n**Extra Space Storage, (EXR)**: This is a Real Estate Investment Trust, paying about 3.5% dividend. Transiting Jupiter aspects 6 planets.\n\n**Enphase Energy, (ENPH)**: This is a solar stock and has a strong Moon in the astro-chart. It therefore moves in a very cyclical pattern. I think the transit of Jupiter aspecting strong natal Moon and Venus can produce good uptrend in prices.\n\n**Exelon Corp, (EXC)**: Although the natal planets in the astro-chart of this company are not as strong as in FB or ENPH, yet the transit of Jupiter influencing almost every natal planet can produce good results.\n\n**WIX.com, (WIX)**: Transiting Jupiter moves over Venus and aspects Mars and Jupiter. This therefore can give better results than many stocks.\n\n**Valero Energy (VLO)**: Energy stocks have been lagging for a few years. From astrology point of view, this stock has the best chart. Transiting Jupiter aspects exalted natal Moon.\n\n**Amazon.com (AMZN)**: The transiting Jupiter aspects 5 natal planets including friends Sun, Moon and Mars. I can therefore can expect good gains from Amazon this year.\n\n**Starbux Corp (SBUX)**: This is my all time favorite stock. The transit Jupiter touches many natal planets. I hope this gives me good results in 2020.\n\n**Mallinckrodt, plc (MNK)**: This stock has been beaten down to unimaginable level due to attack of the short sellers. The transiting planets indicate that this stock could recover to produce some respectable results.\n\nYou see. No arguing about arbitrary lines that any autist can draw on a piece of paper.

Each state is a cluster for this process and checks do backpay, so expect everyone to get caught up on bills through July (for reason #2) Well, unless their more retard than us and give up on the process.\nhighest impact end Sep/Oct 31st\n\n#2: corona stimulas adds another $600/week to end of July (ex. every trailor park clan with both spouses out of work have hit the lottery making almost 7-8k a month) end July 31st.\n\n#3: PPP, wont go into detail and depends on many factors but for our small business it covers about 2.5 months of rent and payroll. Assume will see an increase of small business bankruptcies and lease defaults when these run out ~June.\n\n#4: Most elite institutions got caught this drop, they’re aware of what’s ahead and will try to recoup gains before the rug is pulled. They won’t get caught on the second leg down. \n\nJPOW/FED know the bottom class is fucked this time around and to prevent revolting the massive stimulus was required. There’s too much liquidity and cash flow to crater the market. Suspect we may go up or we go down, but if unemployment stays ~10% by August which I expect, there will be plenty of bad news circling to revisit lows when 20 million are at risk of homelessness.\n\nI get it, I’m a retard and didn’t consider BRRRR, TA, stock market controlled by top 1%, corporate socialism. Just providing the common folk pitchfork defense why your puts were too early, and attached an article that I haven’t read.\n\nSide Note: I know a guy who works at BA and the defense/sattelites/space side is booming, commercial has slowed down, but back log is still there, plus most cancelled contracts are really on hold until conditions approve. So basically, by time conditions approve, Boeing will have not even eaten into the backlog of commercial aircraft while still growing defense contracts YoY. For people that don’t understand a 10 yr backlog, Boeing doesnt get final %50 payment until jet delivery, when the max software gets FAA cert, expect these things to drop like hotcakes and for an earnings quarter it will rain green.

Simply “call” (I asked her how to do it to let them laugh just a little more). If I remember next is the turn, cards are all over, all chances of straight are basically gone except for like a 3-6 which had potential on the flop. Flop comes out, nice it’s just another 7, someone probably thinks they have a two pair. Decide to say “hey if I win or lose I had fun all in” and everyone is like 😊\n\nShowdown comes and I asked them to all show first, and I said “are these good?”\n\nPut the aces down and it was stone silence. Just the sound of me sorting all their chips from the pot, carved off what I think was $20 because I made about $500+ that moment, went to the gift shoppe right that moment, got her the ring, and the next day we blew it all at the little pool party club they have at Harrahs.\n\nThat’s how you get a supermodel to marry you, and now we make masks and crush Etsy sales.", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "This is the stupidest fucking thing I’ve ever read. \n\nP.S.

{"title": "SPY 350c 06/19 or SPY 200p 06/19?", "selftext": "Ok idiots, from a fellow retard to other retards here’s my bull case, followed by a bear case. \n\n1) The huge and rapid sell of mid-March was not just corona, it was also a liquidity crisis that had been brewing since the FED started QE and Repo back in Sept. The rapid economic downturn and JPows printer jumped in hard and fast, providing liquidity for markets. That solved an issue that was a big force driving the sell off and has been a huge source of anxiety of the markets pre/corona. If you think corona was the only thing that produced multiple circuit breakers in March than you are stupid and there’s no help. \n\n2) People really do believe that the fundamentals of the world economy and international market systems are not on par with 2008, which was a real financial crisis of epic proportions. Not just the flu with paranoia as a symptom. A leading component of the massive March sell-off was the idea that a recession was in order. But there’s little evidence to suggest that a genuine recession is about to happen. this will be a quick recovery. Aka not really a recession. I’ve driven by multiple car dealerships in the past few days and you know what they are advertising? 64-80 months of 0% APR on cars. What does that tell you? People think that once the virus has calmed down, people are going to go bananas over lower interest rates and start buying shit like crazy. \n\n3) In sum, the virus is overblown and the Fed’s actions have, inadvertently, helped continue a massive bull run. They’ve solved the liquidity crisis that came with the Fed’s plans to roll back QE and repo in April (originally proposed in beginning of Feb, before the virus really hit american markets) and the market panic of March. \n\nSo what we might be seeing is the groundwork being laid for another bull run and a massive bubble. \nV shaped recovery. \n\n***Bear case*** \n\n1) the virus is actually quite bad and opening up the economy will not immediately result in everyone having their jobs back. If the economy even opens back up. Huge unemployment numbers plus the Fed’s desire to reduce the levels of QE and Repo and Bond purchases, will re-introduce the liquidity issue, which combined with huge unemployment numbers, will result in another leg down. \n\n2) solvency issues. How many companies are about to go bankrupt? If movie theaters cannot open until the fall, then Hollywood is down the shitter. Just think about all of those companies with terrible balance sheets, debt that they cannot pay back, negative cash flow (cough Seaworld cough), we will see sectors of the economy, and the millions of jobs attached to them, drop like a lead ballon. \n\nConclusion: \n\nBull case; coronavirus induced massive and unprecedented action by the Fed, which has inadvertently given new legs for another bull run. That’s all premised on most of the economy and most people getting back to work, having money, and being able to buy cars, max our credit cards, get loans, and buy homes, at historically retarded low interest levels. \n\nBear case: Certain industries are beyond fucked and they will tank, and when they tank, unemployment will continue to stay high, which means no one will be able to take advantage of historically low levels of interest rates. They won’t be buying shit cause they got no jobs. Which will result in loan defaults and a real financial crisis. \n\nI’m leaning toward the bear case this week. But I know JPow and his unlimited printers will come out with something novel and unprecedented which will give rise to another short term bull run. \n\nBut it all depends on if people will actually get their jobs back. Unemployment numbers haven’t tanked the market yet, but that moment is coming, I think. You cannot have these levels of unemployment and markets rising forever. Unless we reopen big and soon. \n\nThoughts?\n\nPositions: your mom, doggy style.

It's a sign that they're desperate to sell inventory, not that they think it will actually work.  I guess it's better than if the sign said \"we know we're not selling anything anyway so fuck you drivers!\" but it's still not great.\n\nOn your question, I say neither.  It won't go to 350 because people just wouldn't be comfortable with a price level that's so clearly not based on reality.  I think if it went to 350 it would trigger a sanity check which would send it down to 200.  But it won't go to 200 because nobody wants it to, especially not the people who have the most ability to influence it.\n\nOn the liquidity issue in your bear case - I think the Fed wants to minimize QE, especially of corporate bonds and CMBS, but they'll go with it as long as they need to (unless they think of a better idea).  And that's a problem because these markets are huge and the Fed is what's propping them up.  When they get close to the $750B authorized amount for corporate, bondholders might panic and try to get while the getting's good.  That could cause a bond liquidity crunch, exactly what the Fed was trying to avoid.  So that program will probably be expanded.  And/or maybe they'll be smart about it and let bond prices fall, then push them right back up, to burn the sellers (they'll underperform their benchmark).  Then repeat.  They could even start the sell-off's themselves, to free up capital, but still burn anyone who joins in the selling.\n\nSo I'm thinking the market will go sideways, with violent swings in both directions, bear traps and bull traps.  I don't have the balls to join Theta gang, and even if I did I wouldn't because I could be wrong.  If I'm wrong I think 350 is more likely, and if it gets to that it could get to 400, even 500 if there's a vaccine soon and/or treatment and the virus is beaten and there's more stimulus (but more stimulating this time; building highways etc., giving good-paying jobs to blue collar workers and improving infrastructure) \\[but that won't happen by June\\].  On the other hand, if there are defaults they could cascade and the situation could get out of hand really quickly.  And if the virus gets out of control in areas that open up, then it might be politically embarassing to have the market doing just fine, so that could change the cost/benefit calculation and push towards letting the private sector take some pain; a big market comeback right before the election could be just as good as a flat market throughout (maybe better, since it would look more real and maybe even would be more real).
