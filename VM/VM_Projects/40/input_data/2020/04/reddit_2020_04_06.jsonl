I actually forgot about this post I made like 1.5 months ago, but your post brought it back.\n\nNow, I'll just start off with a #HumbleBrag to all these \"RemindMe! 1 year\" people so u/LifeInAction, u/sjcha, u/50cent69, u/JustCulmer, u/EggsForGalaxy, u/oppsandadversaries, u/Rupert--Pupkin, u/NurseDaddy17, and some guy who deleted his account (and also u/supercuteji as hopefully he/she bought the calls) that I technically already won my AAPL bet since I said \"300 within a year\" and it got there in like 1.5 months, which is within the year time frame. MSFT is getting close too at 183.  The thing is (not saying you should do this), you could always sell now to lock in the profit of 240 -> 307.5 in AAPL in these 1.5 months and then buy back later if you did think it would go down the next 10.5 months or so (so even if you somehow thought it would be < 300 in exactly a year).\n\nAnyways, to answer your question, I think you want to rephrase your question. The question should be more like \"do you think the stock market will go down in the short term, which will bring down MSFT and AAPL?\"  That's the real question.  Because I can guarantee you, if SPY stays stable, MSFT and AAPL will outperform SPY in the next 5 years. MSFT and AAPL are two of the only stocks which are both blue-chip and growth stocks.  There aren't many stocks paying a dividend that are also growing at their rate.  MSFT's cloud service isn't even anywhere close to becoming as big as it can be.\n\nSo to answer your question, I would say, I can't predict the short term moves that well.  It's true the market can drop to like 250 in the short term, but it's so hard to predict that.  If you could, you would just buy puts right?  But if you kept on doing that the last month, you would have lost everything.  That's why I would say if you are a long term investor, yes, MSFT and AAPL at these higher levels than 1.5 months ago are still good buys.  These will outperform SPY.  These will be higher in some time period in the future, if we assume SPY doesn't keep crashing (which it won't).  These are literally two of the best growth + dividend/blue-chip stocks you can find.  These two stocks should be in any long-term portfolio.  So that's my answer.\n\nI would also say one more thing - keep an eye on this China-US Trade War.  No one's talking about it now.  It's just as big as the pandemic if we start esclalating again, especially for tech stocks.  The pandemic destroyed the non-tech stocks, but tech stocks still hold up well.  It'll start holding up less well if the China-US Trade War starts up again.  AAPL obviously would take a huge short term hit on this.  However, like I said, long term, MSFT and AAPL are two of the best stocks and it's always a buy rating for me, regardless of the price, since I can't actually predict short term moves that well.  If you could predict short term moves, yea just wait for the bottom of the pullback.  I can't though.  No one really can.

I primarily hold ETFs and am plugged into the market day to day because of volatility as of late but I have no worries what so ever with MSFT. \n\nWhile investing during these times I am DCAing and acknowledging that I will not be pulling anytime soon (>15 years, again I hold mainly ETFs) . My criteria for anything other than an ETF is solid financials with cash/liquidity and stocks that have outperformed SPY by at least DOUBLE on a 6 year hold.  My average on MSFT is 146, and I am more than happy with it.

If you can’t see the difference between trying to buy the companies getting absolutely shit on because of all of this from those who have proven the test of time, then we just fundamentally disagree.

Welcome to the new trading week and a fresh start! Here are your pre-market movers and news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[Today's Top Headlines for Monday, April 6th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday.html)\n\n*****\n\n> * Dow futures pointed to an over 800-point gain at Monday’s open as improved coronavirus data in Europe offered hope for the United States. Hints that Saudi Arabia and Russia might be close to an oil production cut deal are also helping stocks. On Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 360 points, capping its third negative week in four and pushing blue chips down 28.8% from their February all-time highs. The prior week, March 23-March 27, saw the best weekly gain for the Dow since 1938. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon, who is recovering from heart surgery, released his widely read annual letter. “We have the resources to emerge from this crisis as a stronger country,” Dimon wrote.\n\n*****\n\n> * The price of West Texas Intermediate crude was down about 2% early Monday, well off session lows of 9%. Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund RDIF, told CNBC overnight that Moscow and Riyadh were “very close” to an output reduction deal. WTI, which surged nearly 32% last week on signs of a possible Saudi-Russian agreement, remained more than 50% off its recent 52-week high in April 2019. On Sunday, President Donald Trump reiterated his threat to impose “very substantial” tariffs on oil imports. But he said he does not believe he’ll need to do so.\n\n*****\n\n> * Heading into what the Trump administration has characterized as the toughest week yet in the fight against the coronavirus, U.S. cases surged to over 330,000, the most of any country in the world — in fact, nearly as many as the next three countries — Italy, Spain and Germany — combined, according to Johns Hopkins University data. There have been 9,653 deaths in the U.S. Over a third of all infections and more than 40% of the deaths in America are in New York state, with New York City shouldering most of that burden. Over the weekend, Trump said 1,000 medical military personnel are deploying to New York City to help treat the overwhelming crush of coronavirus patients. Trump also expressed hope that U.S. cases may flatten soon.\n\n*****\n\n> * Global coronavirus cases increased to nearly 1.3 million with 70,355 deaths and almost 250,000 recoveries. While U.S. cases and deaths have yet to slow, Europe’s hot spots are seeing signs of possibly leveling off, with Spain, Italy, Germany and France seeing death rates and new infections slowing down. Italy still has the most deaths in the world with 15,887, followed by Spain’s 13,055 fatalities. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 55, was hospitalized for tests Sunday, 10 days after contracting the coronavirus. Since Beijing first reported the outbreak in late December, The New York Times said at least 430,000 people have arrived in the U.S. on direct flights from China.\n\n*****\n\n> * Apple is designing and producing face shields for medical workers, CEO Tim Cook said in a video released Sunday. Apple is aiming to produce 1 million face shields per week. Doctors across the country have said that a shortage of personal protective equipment, like face shields and masks, puts them at risk during the COVID-19 outbreak. Cook also said Apple has donated 20 million N95 masks to organizations that need them.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/0rzY1MT.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LAST WEEK'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/bqio851.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/wE4myjO.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/mrxih7p.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/CiSjNJD.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*($SMPL $CONN $GBX $LEVI $ANGO $RPM $SGH $LNN $MSM $SJR $WDFC $NTIC $EXFO $CAAP $SLP $TLGT)*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/R9DSwjk.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n*()*\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\nN/A.\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/czYmPJb.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\nNONE.\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/4kzBNe8.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/gUMjuu3.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/sHtCwud.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/RHiAMQ5.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/GWPlDMv.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S MOST ACTIVE TRENDING TICKERS:\n\n* DAL\n* IMMU\n* ZM\n* LK\n* JPM\n* SQ\n* W\n* AAL\n* WORK\n* USO\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/06/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-slack-zoom-jetblue-delta-boeing-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Slack Technologies (WORK)** – The provider of the popular workplace messaging platform announced a $600 million debt offering due in 2025, convertible into cash, stock, or a combination of both depending on the holder’s preference.\n\n> #**STOCK SYMBOL:** WORK\n\n> * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=WORK&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l)\n\n> ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/WORK)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Zoom Video Communications (ZM)** – Credit Suisse downgraded the video communications platform company to “underperform” from “neutral,” saying the current share price reflects greater conversion to paid usage than will actually occur.\n\n> #**STOCK SYMBOL:** ZM\n\n> * [CLICK HERE FOR CHART!](http://elite.finviz.com/chart.ashx?t=ZM&ty=c&ta=st_c,sch_200p,sma_50,sma_200,sma_20,sma_100,bb_20_2,rsi_b_14,macd_b_12_26_9,stofu_b_14_3_3&p=d&s=l)\n\n> ######(**[CLICK HERE FOR LIVE STOCK QUOTE!](http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/ZM)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **JetBlue (JBLU)** – JetBlue is burning through $10 million per day as it deals with the coronavirus outbreak, according to CEO Robin Hayes.
