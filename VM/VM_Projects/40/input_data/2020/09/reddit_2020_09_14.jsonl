Tanked at open to $235 where it stayed flat for almost the whole day. Then it dropped to $233 where it stayed flat for a couple hours and even dropped to $232 (lower than yesterday's close). Then suddenly, in the last 30 mins  it shot up to $237.\n\nWords through the grapevines are saying that FedEx has an exclusive deal with Walmart Plus tomorrow and it will be announced during their earnings. FedEx has demolished and popped after their last 2 earnings and people are expecting the same again. Their drivers have been busier than ever and the now rumored Walmart+ exclusive deal can lead to another pop at earnings.\n\nIt's possible that it'll dump after ER cus that's what a lot of stocks have been doing. But it's strange that the MM would pin the stock all day if they wanted it to dump after ER. If anything, they woulda let it run as high as it could to dump on people after ER. But instead they pinned it flat for the whole day, almost as if they wanted to shake out the weak hands so they could get more positions.\n\nAnyways, I'm hoping for it to pop tomorrow. I might sell tomorrow at open if it's $250 or so at open. My UPS calls are killing my FDX gains right now. I'll probably break even if FDX doesn't pop tomorrow or after earnings. Will hold through earnings if it opens red tomorrow.\n\nPositions: FDX $237.5c 9/25 and UPS $170c 9/25\n\nEdit: Congrats to everyone that held through earnings!", "id": "istkbb", "created_utc": 1600115887.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 42, "comments": [{"body": "Was hoping to get a discussion post about this, the manipulation was so blatantly obvious.
