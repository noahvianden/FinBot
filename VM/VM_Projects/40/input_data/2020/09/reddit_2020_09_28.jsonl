{"title": "SPCE Update #1 - Welcome to the land of tendies, but remain cautious", "selftext": "Last week, I created a bullish [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iyfo0p/attention_all_those_who_lost_money_on_tesla_and/) on SPCE to help those who nearly lost it all due to TSLA and VALE.\n\nI said I would follow up every Friday, but since the stock is up 20+% as of right now, I have decided to share some more guidance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor me, this is one of the few green days I've seen on my account in a while, and the diamond hands are kicking in. But, being an experienced trader now, I have learned I can't greed too much.\n\nSo what's the plan? Close out some profits and ride the rocket for free. If you bought calls or bull spreads (or sold puts for whatever reason), chances are you're up anywhere from 150% to 300% right now (my call debit spreads are up 200%).\n\nIn order to keep money for future all-ins, I recommend closing 20-30% of your SPCE positions. If you have 1 position, keep it. If you have 2, feel free to decide whether or not to sell one. If you have more, use the %ages as guidance for how much to sell. Or don't, not my money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's take a look at tomorrow's possibilities:\n\nFirst, let's use a key fundamental I have learned: the stock price will go up or down.\n\nPossibility #1 (49.9%):\n\nSPCE goes up: In this case, SPCE will go up. This is good; everyone is hopping onto the hype train. For every % SPCE goes up, close that % times 2 of your current remaining SPCE positions. For example, SPCE goes up 5%, so close 10% of your remaining positions on Tuesday.\n\nPossibility #2 (49.91%):\n\nSPCE goes down: In this case, SPCE will go down. This looks bad at first, but is not that bad. This will probably be from a sell-off, as people who bought in earlier today sell in order to secure quick profits. Do the opposite of what you would do if it goes up. Increase your position by 2x the % it drops (goes down 5% = increase 10%). I recommend avoiding anything above $26 and before 10/23 (but its your money, your choice - what do I know).\n\nPossibility #3 (0.18%):\n\nSPCE remains relatively flat only going up or down +- 2 or 3%. In this case, its not really worth to modify your positions but feel free to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's some quotes to make you feel better through confirmation bias:\n\n\" Bank of America analyst Ronald Epstein set a $35 price target, more than double Virgin Galactic’s closing price on Friday. He said that while the company isn’t yet operational, it’s unique because it has nearly full vertical integration by building, assembling and operating aircraft \"\n\n\" Earlier this month, Credit Suisse reinstated coverage of Virgin Galactic with an outperform rating on prospects for its first commercial sub-orbital flight next year. \"\n\n(from  [https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/virgin-galactic-soars-as-analysts-tout-space-tourism-potential/ar-BB19vrgX](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/virgin-galactic-soars-as-analysts-tout-space-tourism-potential/ar-BB19vrgX)).\n\nI would find more but I'm lazy. Let's ride until the launch. Buckle in. Or strap a rocket on your back. Either works. Launch on 10/22 (if it doesn't get delayed).\n\nI probably won't post again until next Monday 10/5 unless we see a +- 20+% move again.\n\nGood luck!\n\nPOS: SPCE VERTICAL CALL DEBIT SPREAD 10/23 19.5/20, VERTICAL CALL DEBIT SPREAD 10/23 22/22.5\n\nDisclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.
