This is of course among other items such as understanding myself, my ambition, and reasons for doing things.  \n>  \n>3) Amongst all this I started understanding different levels of passive income and what I was comfortable investing myself and time in. 2 things that really interested me were long term stocks and day trading. Simplistic reasons being that I spend probably more time than I should staying up to speed on my interests and certain industries and I like spotting patterns. In a very basic sense these 2 methods hit on aspects of myself that wouldn't \"feel\" like work and would be an enjoyable (and yes, at times frustrating) way to make money.   \n>  \n>At the end of the day, I don't look forward to a 7-4 job working on projects that I have no interest in, forcing myself to do work for little reward when there are other avenues that are, albeit, risky but IMO worth it if approached with understanding, awareness, and practice. I'm still very much a beginner and am learning. This is just one of the avenues that I felt I would like to try. I've no doubt there are others, and I may try them later, but these are the ones that felt most comfortable for me.\n\n...so she says", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Please god whatever you do, don’t spend 15k on Tesla at $500 per share.
