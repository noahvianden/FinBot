They rent them when they win a bid for a contract.\n\nIf an infrastructure bill passes, you want calls on the guys who rent heavy machinery out--They will benefit immediately from higher demand, be able to charge higher rates with older equipment, margins will increase etc...\n\nthe manufacturers will benefit less acutely. Sure they'll sell more vehicles but if the guys who actually buy them are making an arm and a leg with the equipment they already have, they may not be in a huge rush to buy more for something so cyclical. They'll only buy new equipment if that inventory is gonna continue making them money for years \n\n&#x200B;\n\nUnited Rentals (URI) is the one I worked with the most and would recommend (worked in California).
