{"title": "My options trade plan for the day 8th May", "selftext": " \n\n[Series link.](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gei6im/options_trade_plans_master_thread/) \n\nDaily overview heading into the US open. The US options market opens in about 2 hours from now. Futures are up. Prices trade close to resistance. Our outlook for the day is bearish.\n\n**Day opportunity rank: 1 +** \n\nExpected opening action: \n\nSPX is showing increased volatility in the 2920 level, but even with this increases momentum the market is currently unable to break through this level.  If this level can not be broken price is likely to capitulate relative the recent rises. The week trades very close to the high at time of writing, but can close weak - if it does it signals the end of bullish momentum. \n\nWhile the market is above 2900 and under 2930 puts with strikes of 2910 daily can be taken. Accumulation of June strikes at 2750 are also  a good bet. \n\n**Risk assessment of the day;**\n\nBullish risk:\n\nAbove 2950 bullish risk is substantial and above 2979 it is intolerable. If we break above these levels I'll go fully risk of on my positions and not consider selling again until 3100. I may even start to just unwind my shorts entirely.  If the bulls take these areas, they're winning. Until then, I'm comfortable being short.\n\nRange risk:\n\nNominal.  Today is likely to be a volatile day in one direction or the other. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\----\n\nOptions trading can be very profitable but is also something that can have a lot of (especially short-term) variance. To trade options without any losses is impossible and even profitable options trading strategies are going to experience some runs of losing trades. Here are some risk awareness points anyone considering options trades based upon ideas and information posted here;\n\nDaily options 3 times rule:\n\nDaily options can produce either reasonable or exceptional gains in a small period of time. The right option on the right day is worth a fortune, but these are also the trades most likely to produce losses. When taking daily options it's best to adopt a mindset of being willing to lose the option on three attempts if required. That's not to say risk everything over three bets, it's to say bet an amount you can lose 3 times and still be fine to take other trades later.\n\nOpportunity Ranks;\n\nThere is always the option to trade, but the best opportunities to trade come along far more infrequently. Many days and weeks or trading will not present extremely high probability options trades. Using smaller bets during times when the market is offering lower odds (which is most of the time) allows for the riding of more ups and downs in losses while waiting for clearer opportunities. At times when more things line up to support the trade, it makes more sense to bet bigger on these. These are rarer opportunities.\n\nMarket conditions will be ranked as being low (3), medium (2) or high (1) probability. High probability rankings do not remove the requirement or usefulness of the three times rule. Often a big move is going to happen, but getting it on the nose first time is difficult. Hedging and Protecting Positions; It is best to ensure there is capital available to place hedge trades against options you have open if required. This should be considered before opening any trades.\n\nEverything here's educational only.
