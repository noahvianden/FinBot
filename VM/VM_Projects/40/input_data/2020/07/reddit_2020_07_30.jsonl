The tool is still very new but I will keep sharing the alerts with you guys.\n\n# Bullish\n\n**$PDD** \\- Bullish probability of 91.5%. Had a nice pull back before it started to go up again. Maybe we will see another pull back but the tool expects it to go up.\n\n**$AIG** \\- Bullish probability of 90.3%. Would be a good setup if we break the $32.9 resistance level.\n\n**$STX** \\- Bullish probability of 90.1%. Earnings came out and the stock went down a lot. The tool expects it now go high.\n\n**$PTON** \\- Bullish probability of 87.6%. If there is a slight pull back, this can be a great setup as it's been in a strong uptrend. \n\n**$CODX** \\- Bullish probability of 88.5%. Price is squeezing and forming a triangle. Expecting it to break one way. The tool expects it to be bullish\n\n# Bearish\n\n**$KGC** \\- Bearish probability of 91.9%. Had highest high recently but the model expects it to either stop or go down a bit now.\n\n**$SPCE** \\- Bearish probability of 90.3%. A bit more room to go down till the $21.6 level. \n\n**$BLNK** \\- Bearish probability of 87.2%. Risky setup as it went high a lot today. But didn't really close that well and the tool expects it to stop or go down now.\n\n**$KNDI** \\- Bearish probability of 86.4. ***Very very risky*** but the tool expects it to go down now.\n\nPlease remember that the alerts are predicted to pan out in 1-5 days from the current close price i.e bullish should be up more than 1% atleast once in the next 5 days from the current close price. Bearish means it stays below a 1% increase or goes down.\n\n**Note:** A lot of time has gone into these tools and it takes time to write these alerts, look at charts, and post them here.

I wanted to share an allocation I came up with to solicit feedback but also to show you can get good exposure to growth through ETFs instead of tunneling money into stocks if you dont know how/havent had time to do due diligence on individual securities. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n20% VOO- I chose VOO over VTI and SPY because it has the lowest expense ratio and doesnt include the smallcap holdings seen in VTI. (Low Risk Move)\n\n15% VYM- The other etf i was considering here was NOBL, but the expense ratio is much higher at 0.35% compared to VYM's 0.06%.\n\n10% QQQ- NASDAQ has been killing it recently, and I don't see any big players fading soon. IMO tech will continue to rise long term, even more so if any lifestyle changes caused by COVID stick. Tech\n\n10% LQD- I wanted a 90/10 split and chose corporate bonds in part honestly due to past performance and higher yield compared t ogovt bonds. Happy to get any feedback here.\n\n10% VEA- Some foreign market exposure. This has a low expense ratio compared to competitiors IXUS and higher liquidity than SCHF\n\n10% VWO- Emerging markets. This helps diversify and historically has higher returns than US stocks with a bit more risk.\n\n10% VNQ- This is a real estate play. It has a much lower expense ratio than IYR and has ligher liquidity than SCHH. This offers some good diversity and helps against inflation.\n\nThe next 3 are semi-permanent part of the portfolio that i see changing out as necessary over a period of years. My reason for these three is just that I'm a believer in the field.\n\n5% ARKW\n\n5% SKYY\n\n5% IHI- I'm in this field.
