It's trading at PE ratio more than three times what it was just seven years ago and revenue is stagnant.  I wouldn't want such a high concentration of my portfolio in $AAPL.  Many tech companies also aren't a part of this IT index.  Eg. $GOOGL $FB are part of the communications index.  The 50/50 $IGV $IGM is much better than $VGT imo.  I can see the argument for $QQQ as a better investment.  However, I couldn't be convinced $VGT is better since it's too concentrated in IT compared to the expanded tech and software ETFs.\n\nI think 50/50 $IGV $IGM has outperformed both $QQQ and $VGT every year for the past five years.
