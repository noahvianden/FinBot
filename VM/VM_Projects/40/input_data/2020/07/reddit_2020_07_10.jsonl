Wirecard, luckin coffee, etc. Is NIO a scam? Should Gynese stocks be delisted in american markets? Media swirl, etc.\n\n* For NIO, the risk of fraud is already priced in, and I think that's why we haven't yet seen a near-term massive run into the 20's or 30's--investors are being more cautious\n\n* LESS of a fraud risk than NKLA, which doesn't have a working prototype... doesn't matter the nationality, fraud can come from anywhere in a fomo market that shorts auditing\n\n* Did I mention that NIO makes cars? Also incredible battery and logistics infrastructure, including [batteries that switch out](https://youtu.be/h96RKW9s2Sc) and diagnose your car's health faster than you can fill a tank of gas and take a shit... a point of difference against TSLA\n\n* Really the charging stuff is a huge fucking deal, NIO will [send a van to your car](https://electrek.co/2018/07/26/nio-courting-tesla-owners-mobile-charging-stations-electric-vans/) to give you an hour charge while you're at the grocery buying cheetos. When TSLA introduces battery switching, that is when TSLA becomes mainstream. Me and many others don't buy TSLA because they can't road trip for shit, and that's like, part of being american man\n\n* Really tho, their cars [can talk to you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h96RKW9s2Sc) and shit, and China is kinda fucking good at AI so it works, unlike siri, and This guy loves the premium [massage feature at 4:20](https://youtu.be/prNsevvvMQk?t=260)\n\n* Targeted at the bigly-growing gynese luxury market right now of [4.5m millionaires](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/21/china-overtakes-us-in-rankings-of-worlds-richest-people) and will scale to meet broader appeal as they get deeper into the market--copying TSLA's growth strategy exactly\n\n* Now has [massive debt and equity funding](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/04/29/nio-stock-surges-after-funding-secured-but-there-m.aspx) to rapidly expand in Gyna--not just designing and working with manufacturing partners to build cars but expanding the charging infrastructure too\n\n* Its also got [a beautiful design](https://youtu.be/h96RKW9s2Sc), looks better than TSLA in my opinion, and way better than the toyota pious prius bullshit\n\n* RISK: the largest near-term risk is investor wariness looking take immediate profits which may push the stock down to $10 or less\n\n* RISK: Some have mentioned risk of having partners manufacture, but I don't think that's big deal as this is not a traditional car. It may be a more efficient model of separating tech/design and manufacturing. Charging infrastructure really makes sense as 3rd party though, like oil is to cars.\n\nI'm bullish mid-long term. Stock may dip near-term/lots of IV so buy LEAPs to rest easy (holding NIOc 1/15/21 $20), or if big ballz play the delivery number game (holding NIOc 8/7 $15).

Then it became super valuable because now he can buy 100 shares at a steep discount, so he sold that coupon to someone else and that contract is now someone else’s. 99% of contracts expire worthless (the TSLA 1260C 7/10 didn’t lol) \n\nIf TSLA were to immediately drop to 1000 dollars after he just bought the right to buy 100 at 1260 for $2000 his option will just be worth less money than he paid for it the further the stock and demand for that option goes down. At expiration if TSLA was somehow even $100 he would still just be out his 2k investment. \n\n2k is his defined potential loss as he would just be stuck holding a worthless coupon.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Also here’s this little easy to understand basic breakdown for options I find helps everyone I teach options to.\n\n\nLet’s go!! Some basics with maybe helpful examples?Not sure your current understanding.\n\nMost options expire worthless. Options will however be exercised (You will buy or sell the stocks) if the contracts are in the money on expiration (current stock price above or below the strike price in the way you speculated) so if you have 10 F 5p 6/12 (The right to sell 1000 shares of ford at 5 dollars anytime before 6/12) and tomorrow Ford drops to 4.90 your contract will be in the money and if you don’t sell to close (sell your right to this contract so it’s no longer yours) then this contract will be exercised \n\nalso like  90% of people who want to trade options lose all their money. You’re looking to buy the right and then sell your right and take profit, not exercise the option most of the time as you will lose that premium you paid (Sometimes exercising is the right call). Options are more leveraged and you will be paying or collecting a premium to buy or sell these options. One contract is 100 shares. \n\nBuying a call = buying a little e coupon that says you are allowed to buy 100 shares of a stock at an agreed price per share (strike price) anytime before or up to a certain agreed upon date (expiration date). When GE dropped to 5.43 last month  I felt like it was going to at least come back up to 6 so I bought a bunch of GE 9c 8/21 and GE 10c 8/21 (the right to buy GE at 9 dollars and 10 dollars before 8/21) Who would want to buy GE @ 9 when it’s at 5? No one in their right mind, and that’s why that right was so cheap. I paid .10 premium per share to have that right and one contract is 100 shares so I paid 10 dollars for the right to buy 100 shares of GE at 9 dollars anytime before or on 8/21. Flash forward to recently when GE bumped up to 8.40 on June 8th, that right to buy GE was now .69 ($69 a contract) and I had 100 contracts, turning 1000 (100 @ $10 per contract) into 6,900. Of course I diamond handed it (holding and refusing to sell to try and get more profit or having something lose an extreme amount of value and refusing to sell because you think it will rebound then you just lose it all) thinking it would keep moving and now is down to .29 ($29 per contract). \n\nBuying a put = buying a little e coupon that says you able to sell 100 shares of a stock at an agreed price per share anytime before or up to a certain date. Say you see UBER and it just rallied to $37 riding on news of the grubhub acquisition which you know is BS and you have a solid feeling it will come down at least a good bit in the next week. You can buy one put contract to be able to sell 100 shares of Uber. You’re going to pay a premium per share to be able to own the right to sell 100 shares of uber at a set price and date. You’re going to buy an Uber 30p 6/19, the contract you just bought isn’t going to be worth much right now because Uber is $37 dollars a share. The more Uber drops and more the sentiment go in your favor that Uber is going to drop the more valuable your contracts are going to be. A lot of people will swing trade using the leverage to their benefit or possible demise. Buy 100 contracts of UBER 30p and when it goes down just even a little bit sell to close for a profit. Obviously it’s risky. \n\n\nSell a call = collecting credit in exchange for agreeing to sell 100 shares of a stock at a certain price (strike price) anytime by a certain date (expiration date). Takes some capital to do this as naked calls you will need to have the collateral for the 100 shares, unless you own them. I bought 200 shares of T when it fell to $27 most recently. I then sold a covered call on it and sold two contracts of T 35c 6/12 (I’m agreeing to sell someone 200 shares of AT&T at 35 dollars a share anytime on or before 6/12. Someone paid me for the right to buy those 200 shares from me. Friday \n they expired worthless and I kept my premium 200 shares, and even if I had gotten exercised I wouldn’t care because I was okay with getting rid of those 200 shares at 35 dollars since I got them for 27. Going to keep selling covered calls and rolling them out if they get closer ITM until I bring my cost basis per share down even more. \n\n\n\nSelling a put = collecting credit in exchange for agreeing to buy 100 shares of a stock at a certain price anytime by a certain date. Takes capital as you are agreeing to buy 100 shares from someone and need to have that money available. So recently MGM went crazy and I made some money off calls and then lost that money trying to double dip. I decided there was no way MGM will go back down to 20 dollars by 6/12. I sold two puts (2 MGM 20p 6/12- agreeing to buy 200 shares of MGM @ 20 a share) and got paid for agreeing to buy (if the other person wants me to or if the contract is the money by expiration) well I got fucked because it closed below 20 dollars and the option was exercised and I’m going to be put 200 shares of MGM @ 20. It’s fine as that’s the name of the game sometimes and I’ll hold those 200 for longer than a year and right now have 100 I got back at $13 a share. \n\n\nThen you have different option techniques such as credit spreads, debit spreads, iron condors. You can basically take an approach to benefit from the underlying asset doing anything, even staying idle. I don’t feel like typing another book on these so will link you to some stuff I found really useful when I first got into options. \n\nThere are also a bunch of other factors, you can very well be right on your speculation of which way the underlying will move and still lose value. I will compile a nice easily digestible list of resources. \n\nStuff like IV, extrinsic and intrinsic value, the Greeks etc \n\n\nPaper trade and patience are also key!! TD Ameritrade’s think or swim has a free paper trade platform that you can get real time live data with if you call them also. I didn’t start with real money until I ran up my paper trade account and my mentor told me I’m a natural. \n\nFeel free to DM any questions!\n\nEdit: whipped this up in a few mins of rapid typing so it is plagued with errors.
