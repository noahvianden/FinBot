Stock market is \"soaring\" to new heights while 40% of Americans are unsure of how they'll make August's rent. The reason for this is actually understood now- banks are putting their money into the stock market because interest rates are basically 0%, which is inflating the stock market bigly which is causing all of us retards to think we're in a bull market.\n\nMy question to you is, does it LOOK like a bull market to you? I live in San Fran and 40% of small businesses have gone out of business permanently. When I walk around it's like an apocalypse, restaurants that haven't permanently shut down look pathetic, desperately putting tables on the side walk, limited menus, operating at less than 50% capacity at maximum capacity which is never due to covid fears.\n\nGenerally a bull market signals a healthy economy,  our current market is just banks storing money. As soon as interest rates go up, we're going to have the most epic rug pull America has seen in 12 years. This is not \"the sky is falling\", because the sky has already fallen, we're just swimming in the deposits of major players riding the waves up...\n\nCongressional talks are not going well. You CANNOT just keep printing money forever without tanking the value of the dollar internationally. Maybe they will inject another stimulus, but that will only make the problem much worse going forward. It's true that spending during a depression can help stave off calamity, but this isn't that. NO ONE is working because there ARE NO JOBS, and this money being printed isn't to stimulate the economy, it's to keep people on life support.\n\nBIG DIFFERENCE. The economy is so fucked it's not even funny. If you need evidence of this, just go outside and look around. If we inflate our currency even more, world economic policy will further slip into the hands of the Chinese Yuan and consolidate financial power in the Chinese hands.\n\nBut, not of this really matters. I've gotten a tip from someone actually successful that he is loading up on silver. **SLV SHOULD BE AROUND $40 RIGHT NOW** .So I unloaded my AZN retard calls at 50% loss and went all into silver.
