Accounting classification matters.  So, if the costs are buried in the change in warranty reserve, there is a timing difference because the company has already incurred the expense of creating the warranty reserve in the first place, which may or may not be the financial statement period that is currently being scrutinized.  If the costs aren't in the warranty reserve, they go against cost of goods sold and directly affect net income.  Either way, the cost of servicing a warranty reduces net income, it's just whether it's in the current period or not.\n\nThinking about it in another way, let's say TSLA can predict the future and knows exactly how much it will cost to service all of their warranties: $700 million.  In the early years, they build the reserve up to $1 billion because they want to be conservative and no one on the outside knows they own a crystal ball.  They've actually reduced income by $300 million too much, but no one thinks anything of it because TSLA isn't expected to be profitable and it's better to err on the safe side.  Well, once the warranty periods run out, the warranty reserve is sitting at $300 million, but they've done all the work and so they say \"we don't have to incur any more costs, adjust the reserve to zero\" and that $300 million goes straight to net income (before taxes).\n\nAccounting gimmickry?  Possibly, but the auditors identified the warranty reserve as a critical audit matter in their most recent 10-K, so they looked at it.  Since no one can actually predict the future, the warranty is based on estimates of the future, trends, and whatever information hindsight can provide.  The warranty reserve is an estimate.  Is it correct?  Who knows.  Is it too high?  Maybe...but there's no better way to account for it than the approach they've currently taken.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Hey, thanks for this. It’s a complicated subject and not the best medium to discuss over a chat forum(!), so I appreciate your very detailed response.\n\nI believe I understand clearly enough the warranty reserve timing differences and how Tesla can recognise a warranty adjustment credit, when they find the warranty accruals for the quarter are less than the warranty reserve for that quarter. This is what the author of the article focuses on and suggest this difference to be $500m, and why not recognise this straight away?\n\nI’m coming at this from a different perspective; the bears argue (or their arguments that I’ve read)  that in real life vehicle repairs aren’t fully being booked under warranty costs and a significant amount of costs are being written up as goodwill instead. It was a bear argument so I was sceptical at first, but after spending time looking into it there appears to be credible evidence for Tesla repairs doing this.\n\nI’ll try and use an example as well as it might help. Let’s says I require warranty repairs on my Tesla of $2k but $1.5k gets written up as warranty and $0.5k as goodwill (made up numbers). Then the $1.5k would feed into the $700m from your example and using your example again, this is less than the $1bn warranty reserve so it looks like Tesla can report a $300m warranty adjustment credit. This looks great right?...the warranty reserve is higher than the warranty accruals. However, there is still the $0.5k goodwill payment that needs to be addressed for on the income statement. I read it on a bearish tweet a while back and can’t find to link to, but their argument was that Tesla are reporting this goodwill portion of the repair costs under SGA rather than costs of goods sold.\n\nFrom what I’d searched it looks like Tesla have got enough flexibility to decide what some elements of repair fall under, so goodwill rather than being a warranty, so Tesla is fine to do this. Searching also seemed to suggest they are OK to put this goodwill as operating expense rather than within cost of automotive sales. I’m not an accountant so these points I’m not 100% on, but what I’d searched seemed to imply this was fine.\n\nIf this was happening, then it would make sense why Tesla haven’t realised the full $500m warranty credit right now, as they know future goodwill costs are still likely payable in future. It’s not the warranty reserve directly that’s the problem, it’s the use of goodwill and how that would impact the warranty reserve (I.e makes it lower). Again these are bearish views I’ve read, but I’m trying to get a better understanding of whether there is any truth, or if it’s just FUD. I’m honestly inclined to think there’s an element of truth in this.\n\nSorry about the wall of text, would appreciate your thoughts, thanks a lot 👊🏻", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I’m not really sure what the term “goodwill” means in the context of this discussion. I’m guessing it means that TSLA didn’t have to fix something because it wasn’t under warranty, but they did anyway because it makes the customer satisfied with the product they purchased. \n\nRegardless, the warranty is an estimate and there is more than a bit of subjectivity and bias in it. It makes sense to me that their warranty reserve is higher because there are few, if any, cars out there like Tesla’s. At the end of the day, if the January 1 reserve was accurate and the December 31 reserve is accurate, whatever went through it is accurate or at least the cost went through their income statement. \n\nIt’s a hot button issue, enough that PwC brought attention to it in their audit report.
