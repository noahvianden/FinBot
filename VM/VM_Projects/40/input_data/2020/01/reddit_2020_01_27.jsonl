More than a third of S&P 500 that have reported so far sit in the  financials sector, which could skew those results.\n\nThe  FactSet consensus currently calls for net income to fall by 1.9% for  the S&P 500, based on a blend of reported results and analyst  projections, which would mean [the current earnings recession ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/earnings-recession-is-expected-to-swallow-all-of-2019-after-holiday-forecasts-disappoint-2019-11-22)would swallow all of 2019‚Äôs results.\n\nHere‚Äôs what to watch for in the week ahead. \n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-dow-is-about-to-face-its-stiffest-test-in-years-2020-01-25](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-dow-is-about-to-face-its-stiffest-test-in-years-2020-01-25)", "id": "eujtzm", "created_utc": 1580104976.0, "score": 194, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 48, "comments": [{"body": "Everyone is still on their high of meth, its gonna boom from everywhere.

{"title": "Beer Virus vs Earnings Week", "selftext": "The time has come for the ultimate showdown.\n\nBeer virus vs Earnings week lead by the tech giants!\n\n\nEverything seems to suggest that the beer virus has won Game 1 before it's even begun, and they might be right without a big bat on Monday.. not like we can expect Whirlpool to hit a homerun.\n\nAAPL is going to kill in game 2. Expect a late game grand slam, and if the market hasn't already been swayed in favor of the tech giants and earnings week, AAPL will convince them otherwise. Game 2 will also consist of AMD batting .320 like it always does, and even if it slumps early, it'll be back to hitting .320 by the end of the week. \n\nGame 3 could be a huge game for TSLA.. can TSLA really continue to bat a red hot .700 for a whole series and keep knocking in RBIs at a godly pace? My bet is yes. But it will be MSFT who brings home Game 3 and carries the team through the rest of the week. Expect a monster homerun that signifies the death of team beer virus.. one of those games where you feel the breath absolutely knocked out of the opponent. FB will choke, going 2-31 this series.\n\nGame 4 is just a continuation of team earnings game 2 and 3 victories and AMZN shines with a 3-5 day with a few RBIs, nothing incredible but enough to seal the victory for team earnings. Regardless of how game 5 plays out, the series was won here.\n\n\nMSFT 150c's and 160c's, \nTSLA 6/2020 700c, \nAMD 1/2021 30c and couple hundred shares,\n250 shares of TQQQ, \n\nMSFT will be MVP.   \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nGame 1 Update:\nWell.. that's a Game 1 win for Team Beer Virus.. and it wasn't even a close one. Team Earnings falls to 0 and 1 in the series with a brutal 10-0 loss in Game 1, not even a run.. not even a small comeback for QQQ or SPY. Whirlpool didn't do shit.. thanks for nothing Whirlpool, bring a bench cushion for Game 2. We were expecting a Team Beer Virus victory anyway.. onto Game 2.\n\nYes, tomorrow is the day that AAPL and AMD shine bright. The market is already looking green at the prospect of Team Earnings coming from behind to win the series. Stay tuned for Game 2. Chant with me, \"LI-SA SU! WE LOVE YOU! LI-SA SU! WE LOVE YOU!\"\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nGame 2 update: And Team Earnings ties the series at 1-1! What a huge win for Team Earnings.. watching AAPL hit that majestic homerun at the clutchest of times.. just AAPL being AAPL.. Who the hell would be stupid enough to bet against AAPL? GUH. Team Earnings needed this game and they pulled through just as expected. AMD struggled a bit in the later innings, but we all know AMD is a consistent .320 hitter and will be hitting throughout the rest of the series. A little late Whirlpool, but thanks..\n\nOn to Game 3.. what's there to say? Team Earnings is about to pulverize Team Beer Virus in Game 3 and lead the series 2-1. Corona doesn't stand a chance against TSLA and soon-to-be-MVP MSFT. Let the bloodbath that will be Game 3 begin.  \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nGame 3 update: Well, it was a bit closer than I thought it'd be! But sure enough... Team Earnings pulls through for the expected victory! They lead the series 2-1, and barring an upset.. looks poised to take the series victory tomorrow in Game 4. As expected, TSLA continued to bat a red hot .700 through the series, never showing signs of slowing down. And what can you say about MSFT? The stock is an absolute MVP. Period. MVP. AMD is struggling a bit, but will be back to its normal ways by the end of the week, making tendies. Lisa Su, we love you.\n\nOn to Game 4.. Looking for AMZN to end this series tomorrow. I believe AMZN has what it takes to silence Team Beer Virus once and for all. Team Beer Virus is feeling the pain, especially after MSFT took the wind out of their sail in Game 3. Here's to hoping that there's no upset tomorrow, leading to an unpredictable Game 5 to determine the week long series...\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nGame 4 update: Homerun!! AMZN finishes off Team Beer Virus once and for all! What a nail-biter! This one was much closer than anticipated. Team Beer Virus really held their own in Games 3 and 4, but a come from behind win and a gigantic walk off by AMZN finishes this series. It's done folks.. it's over.. ! Break out the champagne!!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSeries recap: It was a bloody Monday for Team Earnings. AAPL steals the show on a big Tuesday win. AMD struggled but definitely helped out in Game 4. Game 3 was closer than anticipated. FB choked, but TSLA and MSFT pulled through for the win. Someone give MSFT the MVP! Thursday was a hell of a nail-biter, but heavy hitter AMZN finished it off for us despite the Team Beer Virus fear mongering. Team Earnings are the champions by a 3 to 1 margin!\n\nMSFT FOR MVP!\n\nI'll be accepting gold now for predicting 6 of 6 earnings reactions correctly. Thanks all!
