{"title": "Here is a Market Recap for today Tues, December 8, 2020. Please enjoy!", "selftext": " **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 8, 2020**\n\nStocks turned positive Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones shaking yesterday’s losses and the Nasdaq recording a new intraday recor. Market participants continue to weigh rising coronavirus cases in the United States and optimism surrounding a vaccine and additional fiscal stimulus. \n\nIn Washington, lawmakers continue to negotiate in order to agree on measures to fund the government and provide another virus relief package. Lawmakers are poised to vote tomorrow Wednesday on a resolution to push back the deadline to fund the government from this Friday to next week in order to avoid a government shutdown, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said. We’ll closely monitor developments in this matter. \n\nIn an effort to support the economy, a bipartisan group of Senators unveiled a new stimulus proposal worth $908 billion, a sum greater than the ceiling Senate Leader Mitch McConnel (Rep.) set but below the Democrat’s original $2 billion proposal. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Dem.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Dem.) have indicated they support the proposal and Senator Bill Cassidy (Rep.) told Fox News he is confident the President and Senator McConnell will support the bill. We’ll have to wait and see how it plays out but we do not expect the passage of any stimulus at least until Biden’s administration takes over.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, says the full impact of Thanksgiving gatherings hasn’t been seen yet. He said, “The blip from Thanksgiving isn't even here yet. So we’re getting those staggering numbers of new cases and hospitalizati0ns before we even feel the full brunt of the Thanksgiving holiday”. The US is averaging nearly 200,000 infections and 2,237 deaths in the last seven numbers, the deadliest week in the pandemic since late April, according to Johns Hopkins University. There are well over 100,000 patients hospitalized with coronavirus. Yesterday, the US recorded around 202,000 new daily infections, 101,487 patients hospitalized, and 1,522 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins Univerisity.\n\nDespite rising cases,  the market is reacting positively to the prospects for widespread vaccine distribution next year and the possibility of additional fiscal stimulus in the US. Margaret Keenan, a 90-year-old woman from the United Kingdom, became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine outside of the clinical trial. While expectations for growth in 2021 remain high, we expect volatility in the market in the short-term, given the surge in coronavirus cases and the reimposition of restrictions across the nation. California recently placed more than 85% of its residents under stay-at-home order after ICU capacity fell below 15%.\n\nLooking ahead, market participants will continue to eagerly follow developments on the coronavirus vaccine. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to convene its outside scientific advisory board on Thursday to discuss Pfizer’s (PFE) emergency use authorization request for its vaccine. The advisors could vote as soon as that day whether to recommend that the FDA green-light the inoculation and allow the first phase of roll-outs to states. Moderna (MRNA) has also filed an emergency use authorization with the FDA. The FDA is expected to make an announcement about Moderna’s vaccine sometime this week as well. \n\n**Highlights**\n\n* The FDA says the Pfizer $PFE vaccine meets all safety and success criteria. They are expected to approve the vaccine in the coming days. \n* A QuantumScape executive claimed the company’s new solid-state lithium-metal battery being developed initially developed for electric cars could be powerful enough for use in electric aircraft. The director said, “Electric aviation starts to look a lot more attractive and viable when you have this kind of energy density and power”.\n* After falling to the low $20s following Citron’s report, Palantir (PLTR) has mounted a remarkable comeback, back close to $30. Today it was announced the company was awarded a $44.4 million contract by the FDA for data analytics services to speed up review of new medicines, according to a company statement. \n* Amazon $AMZN target set by Needham & Co to $3,700 at BUY rating. Stock currently around $3150s.\n* Equifax $EFX target raised by Needham from $200 to $210. Stock currently around $170s.\n* Fedex $FDX target rasied by UBS Group from $320 to $380 at BUY. Stock currently around $297.\n* Intuit $INTU with two target raises. Stock currently around $370s.\n   * Keycorp at $400 OVERWEIGHT\n   * Piper Sandler at $418 OVERWEIGHT\n* Keros Therapeutics $KROS target raised by Piper Sandler from $75 to $95. Stock currently around $75.\n* StitchFix $SFIX target raised by Keycorp from $36 to $56 at OVERWEIGHT.
