{"title": "Largest 5 Auto Markets have BANNED gas powered cars. ICE sales will explode in coming 15 years. Tesla will take lions share of profits and sales.", "selftext": "The largest 5 auto markets are:  \n1. China\n\n2. US\n\n3. EU\n\n4. Japan.\n\n5. India  \n\n\nRecently Japan has announced that they will be banning the sale of all non-hyrbid gas cars in the mid-2030s. China has stated the same. India the same. Many EU nations have and I fully expect to see a block wide ban in the near future. California has in the US and I expect more liberal states to follow suit in the near future as well. So, essentially, 3 out of the 5 largest auto markets have officially banned ICE cars by 2035-40 and the other 2 are well on their way.   \n\n\nThis will force all OEMs to switch dozens of factories over to electric production which will cost them billions.  \n\n\nThis will also force them to compete with each other to secure battery packs from the top manufacturers while Tesla starts to shift production in-house with their 4680 cells and lithium mines being wholly owned (to my knowledge).   \n\n\nTesla is building new factories designed from the ground up to manufacture EVs at a rapid pace which is inherently more efficient in the long term as compared to switching over a factory designed to build something entirely different.   \n\n\nTesla will dominate these next two decades and it won't even be super close imo.  \n\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-to-phase-out-gasoline-powered-cars-bucking-toyota-chief-11608887640](https://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-to-phase-out-gasoline-powered-cars-bucking-toyota-chief-11608887640)\n\n\n\nEdit: Several people have pointed out my misleading wording in the title so sorry for that. The US and EU have not banned ICE cars although a significant portion of the population of those govts have. Regardless 3 of the top 5 have and they represent well over 33% of the world's population and, imo, are still a very real crisis for OEMs. Either take a huge profit hit and convert factories over to EVs asap or die.
