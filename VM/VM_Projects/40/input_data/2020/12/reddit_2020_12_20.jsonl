Basically, you have these opportunists who buy dozens, hundreds of new graphics cards, processors and, more recently, gaming consoles. Then they resell them on Ebay, Craiglist or other bidding/advert sites for 50%, 100% or even more profit compared to what they paid for. The reason why they can do that is due to the pandemic, lockdowns and above-average demand for this type of hardware due to boredom or newfound interest in tech and gaming. Obviously, scalping then creates a short-term shortage, worldwide, or it forces people to postpone buying new hardware due to unwillingness to pay way more than the retail price.\n\nIt's nothing new, basic principle of supply, demand, all that fancy shit...\n\nNow, one possible way to prevent that right now would be to NOT offer this hardware for sale online, at all, at least until the supply catches up with demand, or demand dies down.\n\nGameStop already has a network of brick & mortar stores that can offer this new \"service\". In other words, the management can simply announce something like \"Look, we all know scalping is a problem, so in the interest of preventing that from happening, or at least minimizing it, we will only be selling AMD's CPUs and GPUs, Nvidia GPUs, Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 in our physical store locations until worldwide availability of this hardware stops being an issue.\" Obviously, not in those exact words, it needs to be more pretty and Public Relations-y and whatnot, but you get the point... There is the factor of pandemic and exposing more people to more people, but you just address that by clearly communicating \"6 feet distance between people, no more than X amount of people allowed in store, you will get you chance to buy the console you want to buy your kid for Christmas...\" blabblahblahblah...\n\nWe've already seen them attempt something like that with that last minute announcement of brand new batch of consoles, but that was as sloppy as you would expect from a boomer management who has sticks up their asses and causes a massive shitshow with a move like that. It can be done way more elegantly and transparently, communicated clearly to the audience of potential buyers without causing a PR debacle.\n\nIf they could just see an opportunity in this and announce it clearly to a wider gaming community, they could even use this to dip further into PC hardware as a perfect way to expand their reach in that sector.\n\nI don't have high hopes for something like that happening, you 'Muricans be stoopid like that (jokes, I love you!) but on the off chance a GME employee or a mid-level manager reads this, I'd say you should consider telling this to your superiors, because opportunities come and go, you have to act on them swiftly.\n\nPOSITION: 231 shares @ 15.4  (I'm europoor, yeah... üò¢ )\n\nTL;DR:  sell stuff in B&M stores to avoid online scalpers,üíéüôå üöÄüöÄüöÄüåö", "id": "kgl51v", "created_utc": 1608429065.0, "score": 47, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 49, "comments": [{"body": "What I can‚Äôt figure out is why they hell they don‚Äôt make a rip-off of eBay for games/hardware. \n\nOnline marketplace and just lower the house margin to 5% instead of 10%. \n\nAllow person to person transactions, sell direct to GameStop (basically car-max), and/or selling their own inventory of used equipment/games auction or buy-it-now....", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "This comment is so underrated.", "score": 9, "replies": []}, {"body": "What‚Äôs up Mr. Cohen ü§üüèª", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "Yea they could at least do a thing on their website that gives like instant quotes on used games and hardware and like maybe send you a package with a prepaid label to mail them your stuff in.", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "I don‚Äôt know if you gave ever sold anything on eBay.

GME can act as a hub where console and PC component manufacturers can send their supplies, knowing that those supplies won't end up in the hands of scalpers. It wouldn't give them a unique advantage, there's Microcenter and other retailers already established in that space, but sometimes just doing what others have already proven to be profitable can make you money as well.\n\nPeople are willing to wait in line a little bit for a guarantee to buy at a retail price.
