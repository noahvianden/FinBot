First of all don't expect earnings beat from GME for this quarter, shortage of consoles and competition from Amazon and Walmart means GME's probably gonna post a disappointing report, they'll probably guide up and highlight their cleaner balance sheet and maybe even talk about restructuring like Ryan Cohen wanted but who knows what gonna happen. So yea it might dump after earnings.\n\nbut we ain't here to \"invest\" fundamentally, we're here for the epic short squeeze.  I don't give a shit about their FCF or valuation based on whatever fuckhead analyst's model.

OI for call options doesn't even compare. Lots of gay bears (or maybe it's a hedge idk)  gonna get IV crushed, which is actually more bullish than you think. Because when those puts expire worthless, MM is gonna close their hedges by BUYING BACK the stock that they shorted when they hedged those puts. This effect MIGHT be very noticeable EOD on Dec 18 2020. In fact, it's probably what happened to PLTR last Friday, when about 30% of all calls expired and MM sold their hedges as your calls expired worthless, leading to a dump.\n\nDo what you will with this information, but MINIMUM pain for MM at that week dec 18 is situated right around the $17 mark, unless the MM gamma exposure changes.\n\nGME price too low imo\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmy positions\n\n900 shares of GME @ 18ish (im a retard)\n\nshort 9 x $ 20 weeklies\n\nLong 4 x $18 weeklies\n\nwill add more if all you people got TP hands\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Just wanting to add, not too sure what MM estimated gamma exposure is for GME right now, but its probably - 1000000 ish, if you buy the MMs buy, if you sell MMs sell", "id": "k4an9c", "created_utc": 1606786753.0, "score": 93, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 41, "comments": [{"body": "OG bull here coming to cleanup OP's post\n\nGME fiscal year is 1 month behind calendar.
