{"title": "[DD] GME earnings and option positioning", "selftext": "Ok retards it's time to take a closer look at GME now that earnings are coming up on Dec 8th. First of all don't expect earnings beat from GME for this quarter, shortage of consoles and competition from Amazon and Walmart means GME's probably gonna post a disappointing report, they'll probably guide up and highlight their cleaner balance sheet and maybe even talk about restructuring like Ryan Cohen wanted but who knows what gonna happen. So yea it might dump after earnings.\n\nbut we ain't here to \"invest\" fundamentally, we're here for the epic short squeeze.  I don't give a shit about their FCF or valuation based on whatever fuckhead analyst's model. Whatever happens after earnings, it's important that we diamond hand this baby and roll your calls instead of just selling it like a weak ass pussy.\n\nIV for options around earnings are huge at \\~250%, so there's a good chance that a lot of you retards will get IV crushed (if you're worried buy your calls further out, closer to the money or just buy shares)\n\nWhat I noticed is that there's a huge open interest of 20k for Dec 18 $17 puts and 12k for Dec 18 $16.5 puts. OI for call options doesn't even compare. Lots of gay bears (or maybe it's a hedge idk)  gonna get IV crushed, which is actually more bullish than you think. Because when those puts expire worthless, MM is gonna close their hedges by BUYING BACK the stock that they shorted when they hedged those puts. This effect MIGHT be very noticeable EOD on Dec 18 2020. In fact, it's probably what happened to PLTR last Friday, when about 30% of all calls expired and MM sold their hedges as your calls expired worthless, leading to a dump.\n\nDo what you will with this information, but MINIMUM pain for MM at that week dec 18 is situated right around the $17 mark, unless the MM gamma exposure changes.\n\nGME price too low imo\n\n&#x200B;\n\nmy positions\n\n900 shares of GME @ 18ish (im a retard)\n\nshort 9 x $ 20 weeklies\n\nLong 4 x $18 weeklies\n\nwill add more if all you people got TP hands\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Just wanting to add, not too sure what MM estimated gamma exposure is for GME right now, but its probably - 1000000 ish, if you buy the MMs buy, if you sell MMs sell", "id": "k4an9c", "created_utc": 1606786753.0, "score": 93, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 41, "comments": [{"body": "OG bull here coming to cleanup OP's post\n\nGME fiscal year is 1 month behind calendar.

My confidence comes from taking as much information as I can and deducing it for myself.  My confidence comes from making decisions like backing a friend who launched a website selling items like \"stop the steal\" stickers because half the country doesn't have the reasoning abilities of most middle schoolers.  My confidence comes from a lifetime of objective experiences that have shaped my ability to be confident in my convictions.\n\nMy confidence comes from knowing objectively that I'm on the right side, and know enough not to try sway willfully ignorant people to see things my way by hinting that I'm right and you'd see that  if you just watched this or that.\n\nMy confidence comes from people like you, people who are so sure they are right with no actual basis.  When people like you jump on a trade because \"you feel good\" about it and \"it's definitely gonna go up!\"  My confidence comes from te patience I have as I watch you get it right before the peak, get scared and start selling off because you don't have the confidence in your decision you were just hoping or following some tip.  My confidence comes from waiting, having the self discipline to know people like you exist and my play is coming after yours predictably fails.  My confidence comes from knowing I don't know anything, and the humility to be ok with that.  \n\nMy confidence comes from not worrying about trying to show people the light, show them the hearings because if they are smart and confident they will figure it out on their own.\n\nYou laughed saying how yo my find it funny that I speak so confidently and I haven't even watched the hearings.
