{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 2nd, 2020", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/StockMarket. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week and month ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 2nd, 2020.\n\n# **Stock rout may deepen in the week ahead as coronavirus impact starts to show up in economic data  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/28/stock-rout-to-deepen-as-coronavirus-impact-starts-to-show-up-in-data.html)**\n*****\n> Stock investors just experienced one of the nastiest weeks in history that recorded the S&P 500′s fastest correction on record, but hold on tight, the market might have more room to fall as the coronavirus damage starts to creep into upcoming economic data, analysts warned.\n*****\n> Major U.S. stock averages suffered their worst week since the financial crisis as fears about the coronavirus disrupting the global economy scared investors away from risk assets. However, stocks might still be searching for a bottom next week when investors grapple with a slew of economic data potentially dragged down by the outbreak.\n*****\n> The Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing gauge on Monday. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will publish its latest Beige Book on Wednesday, which will detail anecdotal information on current economic conditions. Many expect U.S. manufacturing to have taken a hit from the coronavirus.\n*****\n> “Look out for ISM surveys and Beige Book for early signs of COVID-19 impact,” Michelle Meyer, Bank of America’s head of U.S. economics, said in a note Friday. “It will take time for the ‘hard’ economic data to show the impact but we are already seeing evidence in early economic indicators.”\n*****\n> Weekend action?\n> The outlook for the week could be changed this weekend by coronavirus headlines or by some sort of intervention by central banks. Expectations are rising on Wall Street that there could be some potential move from the Federal Reserve to get ahead of what could be another rough week.\n*****\n> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank is monitoring the coronavirus and pledged action if necessary. Meanwhile, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh recommended the Fed act as quickly as Sunday before the markets reopen. The market is already pricing in a 100% chance of at least one rate cut at the Fed’s March policy meeting.\n*****\n> Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group, is worried about the cascading effect of coronavirus hitting upcoming economic data points. “ISM manufacturing is going to be widely scrutinized,” he said.\n*****\n> The ISM manufacturing index rose to a reading of 50.9 last month, the highest level since July (Any reading above 50 signals expansion.) Bank of America expects ISM manufacturing to pull back to 50.0 and said Fed Beige Book may provide “early insight” into the U.S. economic impact from the deadly virus.\n*****\n> Cutting forecasts\n> Next week, investors will also likely grapple with more warnings from major companies about broken supply chains and easing demand due to the outbreak.\n*****\n> Apple, Microsoft, Nike and United Airlines have all sounded alarms that they will not meet their earnings and revenue guidance because of the virus.\n*****\n> Wall Street strategists this week were quick to slash their forecasts on corporate earnings and the stock market. Barclays sees the S&P 500 to end the year at 3,000, down from a previous forecast of 3,300. The bank also expects a 2% drop in profits this year. Meanwhile, Goldman said it sees zero earnings growth for American companies in 2020.\n*****\n> To be sure, some believe the steep stock rout has gone too far too fast, betting on at least a small rebound.\n*****\n> “The level of panic has become very extreme and the level of downside price movement is pretty extreme. All of that is to me more of a sign that we are getting closer to the beginning of the end of it,” Paulsen said.\n*****\n> Another source of support could come from the Trump administration, where officials are discussing tax cuts, among other economic reactions, as one option to make up for the economic impact of the coronavirus, the Washington Post reported Friday.\n*****\n> Still, investors will have to be on edge for a while now with more virus headlines, as well as the key Super Tuesday Democratic primaries. Some notable investors including “bond king” Jeffrey Gundlach blamed the rise of Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders for helping accelerate massive sell-off.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/xxV96kn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/3XfCFrl.jpg))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/zbhTBQr.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/zASmUSl.png))**\n\n# **Sector Performance WTD, MTD, YTD:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_t.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE WEEK-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_w.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MONTH-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_m.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 3-MONTH PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_q.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_ytd.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE 52-WEEK PERFORMANCE!](http://elite.finviz.com/grp_image.ashx?bar_sector_y.png&rev=636115211971930604))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/wv7Xef1.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/qPOD5uN.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/2z1n5iA.png)**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/jgqhUBR.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/j7kavSk.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/4awCCsW.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/ElXoU2T.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/xH2GYRk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/HyXxrSJ.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #4!](https://i.imgur.com/GIw7Oq6.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Gauging Potential Economic Impact of Covid-19\n\n> The coronavirus outbreak—or Covid-19 —has caused significant market volatility over the past week. Our approach as always is to focus on economic fundamentals first, but the uncertainty around the scope of the outbreak has made it very difficult to assess potential impact. The situation clearly is unsettling for investors as more cases are reported across Europe and Asia, and the first case of community transmission has been reported in the United States. As this was written, the S&P 500 Index was 10% below its February 19 all-time high.\n\n> “The Covid-19 outbreak continues to significantly disrupt economic activity in China and throughout Asia,” said LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Given that China is such a big component of many global supply chains, we will almost certainly see weaker economic data globally over the next several months.”\n\n> Even as the situation remains fluid and very uncertain, we want to provide some sense of the potential U.S. and global economic impact.\n\n> **China**: If virus containment holds in China, which is our base case, we could see something like a 3–4 percentage point impact to Chinese economic growth in the first quarter—possibly 2–3% gross domestic product (GDP) growth rather than 5–6%—followed by a much more modest hit in the second quarter. We think we would see a return to trend growth by the third quarter of 2020. This scenario would put China’s 2020 GDP growth below the current 5.6% Bloomberg-tracked consensus, shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, and the Chinese government’s previous 6% annual target. In other words, China’s GDP growth in 2020 could end up closer to 5% than 6%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> United States: At this point, our base case is that any economic disruption in the United States may be modest and short-lived, as we expect domestic efforts at containment to be more successful and have less economic disruption than in China. The outbreak may trim 0.25–0.5% from U.S. GDP over the next couple of months due to global supply chain disruption, falling export demand, and decreased tourism. If evidence emerges over the next month or so that the virus is being contained successfully, as we expect, the economic impact would likely be at the better end of that range (0.25%). In that scenario, damage to business and consumer confidence would be limited, setting the stage for a potential second-quarter rebound. We believe our 1.75% U.S. GDP growth forecast may still be achievable.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Global-econ2.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> **Global**: In the short-term, the collective hits to global GDP from China, South Korea, Japan, and Italy—the countries where the outbreak impact has been greatest to date—may comprise 0.2–0.3% of global GDP. Our latest global GDP forecast of 3.5% from our Outlook 2020 publication is probably a bit too high in light of the latest news. We expect to update or reaffirm our economic forecasts once we have more clarity around Covid-19 impact in the weeks ahead.\n\n*****\n\n# Can the Market Bottom on a Friday?\n\n> It's often said that equity markets can't bottom on a Friday. One of the reasons for this line of thinking is that during a market downturn, no one wants to hold onto or bid up equities into a weekend for fear of further bad news. It may just be a matter of semantics, but based on that line of reasoning, the more accurate way to phrase it would be that markets can't bottom on a Thursday or rallies can't begin on a Friday. However you want to think about it, the chart below shows the number of times the closing low of a 10%+ correction has occurred on various weekdays.\n\n> Of the 97 S&P 500 corrections since 1928, the day of the week that has marked the low close of a 10%+ decline the least frequently is actually Wednesday with only 10. Behind Wednesday, Friday has been the second most infrequent day of the week for a bottom (15), and Thursday is the only other day of the week where the S&P 500 has made a low on a closing basis less than 20 times. The days of the week where the S&P 500 most frequently bottoms are Monday and Tuesday with 26 and 28, respectively.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-10-Corrections.png))**\n\n> Regarding bear markets (20%+ declines), the trend is very similar. Bear markets have been the least likely to end on a Wednesday or Friday and most likely to end on a Tuesday.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022820-Bear-Markets.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Dividend Stock Spotlight: S&P 500's Highest Yielders From The Sell-Off\n\n> Given the lower prices of stocks, dividend yields have been on the rise over the past couple of weeks. The dividend yield of the S&P 500 now stands at 2.12% which is the highest since June 3rd of last year when it reached the same level, but only stayed there for a single day. Prior to that, yields were only higher during the Q4 2018 sell-off through February of 2019. At the beginning of the current sell-off on February 19th, the S&P 500's yield was 26 bps lower at 1.86%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Div-yield-sp.png))**\n\n> Of the individual stocks in the index, there are now 81 stocks that have dividend yields of 4% or more. That compares to only 64 at the beginning of the sell-off. In the table below, we show the 25 highest yielders of the S&P 500 as well as the price change and change in the dividend yield since the 2/19 record high. As shown, there is only one stock, Macy's (M), that yields over 10% at the moment. This major retailer has fallen out of favor in the past few years but the stock has gotten crushed since the 2/19 market peak having fallen just under 21% in that time. That decline has raised the dividend yield by 2.44 percentage points, but there is one other stock that has seen its yield increase by even more. That stock is Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the second-highest yielder in the index (9.93%). Being an Energy name, OXY has fallen the most dramatically (-29.05%) since 2/19 of all the highest yielders.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Highest-Yielding-table1.png))**\n\n> While there is a lot of overlap, in the table below we show the stocks that have seen their dividend yields rise the most as stocks have declined since 2/19. Again OXY and M top the list. While no other stocks have seen their dividend yields increase by more than 2 percentage points, there are another 17 who have risen by at least 1 percentage point. Notably, two cruise line stocks, Carnival (CCL) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) find themselves on this list. Carnival (CCL) now yields 6.28% while Royal Caribbean (RCL) yields 4.05%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Biggest-Change-yield-table.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# The Biggest Losers (and a few winners)\n\n> It is no secret that energy stocks have gotten crushed this year, and the list of the 25 worst-performing stocks in the Russell 1000 since the previous record close on February 19th is a prime example of this. Seven energy stocks find themselves on this list, two of which, Chesapeake Energy (CHK) and Kosmos Energy (KOS), take up the number one and two spots having fallen 45.73% and 41.95%, respectively since 2/19. CHK had already been weak headed into the broader market sell-off with a YTD loss on 2/19 over 40%; the past week has added fuel to the fire as it is now down 68.5% YTD. Continental (CLR), Centennial Resource Development (CDEV), Transocean (RIG), and Apergy (APY) are other energy stocks that were down 20% or more on the year headed into this sell-off, and each one has fallen another 20%+ since the 19th. While most of the other biggest losers since 2/19 had already been down on the year, there are some that have seen their gains in 2020 get erased due to this sell-off like Nutanix (NTNX), Qurate Retail (QRTEA), Anaplan (PLAN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Chemours (CC), and CommScope (COMM). Some other notable losers of this group have been those heavily reliant on travel like American Airlines (AAL) and the cruise line stocks like Norwegian (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Worst.png))**\n\n> Given how breadth has been over the past week, it may not come as any surprise that since the February 19th high there are only 18 stocks of 1000 in the Russell 1000 index that are higher. Four of those are up less than one percent. In the table below we show all of these stocks. Given the sell-off has centered around coronavirus fears, it is sensical that a coronavirus vaccine developer Moderna (MRNA) is the best performing stock since 2/19. What is amazing is there was not much momentum with this name headed into the sell-off. As of 2/19, the stock was actually down 3.27% year to date, but as the Covid-19 saga has moved along it is now up well north of 30% on the year. A few other health care names like Regeneron (REGN) and Gilead (GILD) have also benefited from the coronavirus.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Best.png))**\n\n> The histogram below shows the distribution of performance of Russell 1000 stocks since 2/19. As mentioned above, there are very few stocks in the index that are up since the 2/19 high. The highest share of stocks are down between 10% and 15% while the next highest share are down between 5% and 10%. Of the worst decliners, there are 75 stocks that have fallen over 20%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/hist.png))**\n\n> Looking at the individual sectors, again Energy was extremely weak even before equities sold off. On 2/19, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1000 in that sector was down 15.6% YTD. While they hadn't tipped into the red yet, Consumer Staples were only up 1 bp.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/YTD-of-219.png))**\n\n> Since the 2/19 high for the US equity market, the average stock in the Russell 1,000 is down well over 10%. The average Energy stock is down the most at -21%, followed by Communication Services and Technology at -13%. Consumer Staples stocks have performed the best with an average decline of 8.9%.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/Since-219.png))**\n\n> This leaves every sector down year-to-date. Utilities have generally outperformed only falling 2.3%, but the sector is sitting on a loss nonetheless. Of the worst sectors, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Materials, and of course Energy have fallen 10% or more.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/RIY-CYTD.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# Global Equity Benchmarks Distance From YTD Highs\n\n> The recent equity sell-off has clearly been global in nature as concerns of a global pandemic rise. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the way equities have sold off recently is that the country that has been hardest hit by the virus is closer to its YTD high than any other major global equity benchmark. The chart below shows the distance that each major global equity benchmark has declined relative to its YTD high. China's Shanghai Composite is down just 4.45%, which is better than any other country shown. Sure, you could argue that the Chinese government is manipulating the market and prohibiting investors from selling, but even the ETF that tracks the CSI 300 (ASHR) is down less than 6%, so anyone could go in and trade at these levels. Manipulated or not, the numbers are the numbers.\n\n> At the bottom of the list, Brazil's Ibovespa index is down more than any other country at 11.6% and that country has only reported one confirmed case so far. With respect to US indices, the Russell 2000 is down the second most of any major global benchmark (-9.19%), while the Nasdaq is down the fourth most at 8.68%. Even the S&P 500 is down close to 8%. These weak US readings come in a backdrop where there have only been 57 confirmed cases and all but a couple are instances where Americans contracted the virus outside of the United States and have been brought to the US under quarantine.

Since WWII, there have only been four other weeks where the S&P 500 was down more than 10% in a given week. On a related note, there are also only four stocks in the entire S&P 500 that are positive for the week! Leading the way higher, Regeneron (REGN) is up a healthy 7.1% while Gilead (GILD) is up just over 4%. Behind these two, the only other stocks that are higher now than they were at last Friday's close are Clorox (CLX) and CME Group (CME).\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Gainers.png))**\n\n> On the downside, there are a lot more losers, but in the interest of space, below we have only listed the 17 stocks in the S&P 500 that are down over 20% this week alone. Looking through the names on the list, the cruise lines are well represented with Royal Caribbean (RCL), Norwegian Cruise Lines (NCLH), and Carnival (CCL). Besides these names, American Airlines (AAL) is down 26%, while Live Nation (LYV) is down 22.2%.\n\n> One thing we've heard a number of people argue the last few days is that some of the weakness this week is related to the increasing likelihood that Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination. If that's the case, why is not a single one of the worst-performing stocks from the Health Care sector, and why is the Health Care sector the third best performing sector this week and one of just four that is not down 10% so far this week?\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/02/022720-Biggest-Decliners.png))**\n\n*****\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: Stock Market Analysis Video for Week Ending February 28th, 2020** \n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkYpcmapyKs))**\n\n# **STOCK MARKET VIDEO: ShadowTrader Video Weekly 3.1.20**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE YOUTUBE VIDEO!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQM7SrVGFvY))**\n\n*****\n\nHere are the most notable companies (tickers) reporting earnings in this upcoming trading week ahead-\n\n*****\n\n> * **$TGT** \n> * **$PLUG** \n> * **$JD** \n> * **$ZM** \n> * **$COST** \n> * **$TLRY** \n> * **$AZO** \n> * **$KSS** \n> * **$SPLK** \n> * **$DLTR** \n> * **$VEEV** \n> * **$XRAY** \n> * **$SE** \n> * **$MRVL** \n> * **$FOLD** \n> * **$KR** \n> * **$OKTA** \n> * **$STNE** \n> * **$BLDP** \n> * **$BURL** \n> * **$CIEN** \n> * **$ALBO** \n> * **$MAXR** \n> * **$ANF** \n> * **$ITCI** \n> * **$FNKO** \n> * **$JWN** \n> * **$EPRT** \n> * **$VIPS** \n> * **$GTT** \n> * **$CORE** \n> * **$BNFT** \n> * **$LVGO** \n> * **$EVRG** \n> * **$ROST** \n> * **$EGRX** \n> * **$AOBC** \n> * **$TGLS** \n> * **$ATRS** \n> * **$HPE** \n> * **$NWN** \n> * **$WVE** \n> * **$WSC**\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/j7kavSk.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/x29nduD.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 3.2.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/WpXhdqA.png))\n\n\n> # ***Monday 3.2.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/ycdhPpa.png))\n\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.3.20 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/VIBwP3J.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.3.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/0CU1CX3.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.4.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/BCVHMu2.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.4.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/6EsJdZf.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.5.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/3YUYSb9.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.5.20 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/M3Hifok.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.6.20 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/n0W1FLJ.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.6.20 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\nNONE.\n\n*****\n# Target Corp. $103.00\n> **Target Corp.

{"title": "I found this interesting re: QQQ today. Fuck if I know if it is interesting to you.", "selftext": "So full disclosure; I have an option put position in QQQ for Mar 2021.  I got lucky with timing, so not posting to brag.  Just assume I am an idiot for your own safety.  Maybe I give it all back next week, who fucking knows when the VIX was as high as 48+ this week. I was a bear before it was cool to be a bear in this market.  But, I'm telling you this so you know why I am paying attention to QQQ.\n\n[My QQQ position - yes, I am a pussy who doesn't YOLO.  I haven't hit my head hard enough to be fully autistic yet.  My bad.](https://preview.redd.it/o0z389ojlrj41.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d4a76213c1dfa663cf30f518da17d3032d11ab5)\n\nSo now that we established, that I am interested in QQQ market movement, I noticed something interesting today @ market close:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Nice action from 200 to 205 in the last 15 minutes of a shit week.](https://preview.redd.it/b0bvd5p4mrj41.png?width=634&format=png&auto=webp&s=76c1830288787fa2739b3ef8d0ed2115835959ba)\n\n\\- So I assumed originally that this was bear shorts closing their position on a monster week and getting out of dodge of the inevitable rate cut from Jesus (played by Jerome Powell).\n\n\\- Or maybe it was a bull who wanted to get a jump on positive action for next week.\n\nThen I looked at options.  We started the week @ 221 more or less.\n\nNear the money:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uzp4riutmrj41.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=d0bb4f51ed436f19da2c365d9d48c389b292c7d3\n\nWider view:\n\n[That is a lot of volume around 205.](https://preview.redd.it/the77njlmrj41.png?width=976&format=png&auto=webp&s=03b3548e417171818fa778e2abd0cefbe96529ac)\n\nSo anything below 206 expired out of the money this week.  But to get there, someone had to make a HEAVY lift from \\~200 to 205 in the last 15 minutes.  If you sold a put between 221 and 206, you are already in the shit and probably failed to defend earlier this week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fuck anyone below 206.](https://preview.redd.it/rdwq7h71orj41.png?width=938&format=png&auto=webp&s=42cb59a9b1e1c0343e4e5080f8d8337739581cc0)\n\nSo, tin foil hat on, this info made me ask some questions to myself.  Because I talk to myself.  I'm not well, and don't have many friends:\n\n\\- Why did 200 - 205 get taken out 15 minutes prior to close?  Was it defensive hedge fund X who was avoiding having to eat those put contracts, or was it some (soon to be) poor institution who had to cover between 206 and 221 and took out the stack when it was clear that hope was dead, and bears run the market right now?\n\n\\- Was one person or institution holding the 200 - 205 bag for option puts in QQQ? I can't believe too many people got together to punch through the stack in the last 15 minutes for shits and giggles after the week we had.\n\n\\- If so, how much of the following bags are this group holding for the next 7 days?  And who else is out there to get in front of this shit show?  You need balls of steel or rampant stupidity to stick your neck out here as far as I am concerned.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nl8en5q6wrj41.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=301b573efcb2f56cdb864d687bb1e637fecb5bba\n\nI think the action next week in QQQ will tell us a lot about the market.  If we retrace back up from here, then maybe the sky is NOT falling and I need to check my own beliefs.  But if we start punching thru all of these put option open interest AGAIN for a second straight week, I am not sure where the bloodletting stops.\n\nI marked this post as a shitpost because I am not qualified to give you advice.

While driving to work our day shift at Wendy's has never been cheaper and I can afford two colt 45s to numb the pain each Friday of grease burns, I know in five years time I am going to be on a diet of ramen when barrels cost $100 again after OPEC seizes supply chain initiative again.\n\nY'see in the land of the free we don't have any oil cartels to fix the prices so that they wouldn't pump each other out of business. In fact, that is illegal. While that may sound like an economic principle related to the handjob economy, the same principle applies.  More wsbers out there giving handjobs on my block, the lower my prices I have to go or the more I have to pump to make the same amount of dollas, or  I have to become an uber driver or something to make the extra 15 an hour I need to repay my student loans BUT at a certain  the cost of manicuring my nails, moisturizing my palms, and bribing the local PD means I'm actually losing money each hand job I give out. The same rules apply for barrels full of oil.\n\nConveniently in the news today prices were buoyed EOD a bit by Saudi Arabia saying they were 'doubling' their efforts to get Russia to agree to production cuts with a price target of $50 a barrel.  Oh yes, the Russian boogeymen are out there again and our faithful ally Saudi Arabia is attempting to help our companies out by pressuring Russia.  Wrong. Anything under $50 the USA remains fucked particularly the further away you go from refineries/transportation facilities. (North Dakota)\n\nSaudi Arabia has recently been generous enough to start offering shares of their company to the general public as long as you live in Saudi Arabia and know someone with Bin for a middle name.  They are the world's most richly valued company yet understand the max economically productive life of their product has at most 30 years left.  This past September we saw what a nice week long oil shock did to help their IPO process get them their initial valuation they wanted - but what if they could kill off several million barrels  (5% of the world's production or 4mill barrels a day) ,the equivalent of Iran's oil production; if not more, of production by having the world's largest oil producer - the USA produce itself to death due to being leveraged to the tits against businesses literally run by a government with no debt and cash in hand of hundreds of thousands per person. I wonder how that 5% would compound over the next 25 years and how many more tickets to mars you can buy for your people to leave your desert shithole?\n\nNow allow me to introduce you to a world where few people travel anymore for leisure.  This world exists because there is a mysterious mist out there that when you get it, you get mild to severe flu symptom and that is very bad.  Planes are full of this mist too, as are cruise ships, which use oil! Also in this world transport of goods slows due to less economic activity due to these fears and the velocity of money slowly starts to grind down and rate cuts can't do much as it's a bandwidth issue. Welcome to 6 months from now. Oil is in less demand except in the plastics industry as it pertains to making tyvex suits.\n\nNow let me bring you back to the past, a way long time ago in 2016 when there was a mild economic disturbance and oil prices dropped to 35-45 a barrel.  A lot of companies told bankers -\n\n*'hey we need a loan check out these charts we made and as you can see if you just give us a little loan, we'll make it through this.  thank you mr. banker for the 9% rate along with some super long term 3% that is very generous. can i have some mid dated 6%ers tho. oh those notes expire in 2021?  yes we will have enough money by then, our analysts project a mean average of 70 a barrel and as you can see our profitability will be up by a multiple of 2 for every 10 dollars above 60.  we will even be ok if it's conservatively 60 dollars a barrel in north dakota and 55 in texas.  thanks mr. banker there is no way this goes tits up'*\n\n**Bloomberg is of the opinion reddit speculators causes economic downturns, not hundreds of billions of dollars worth of low interest loans derived from a low federal interest rate on a product that has no economic moat and literally squirts out of the ground and there other areas of the world where it squirts out cheaper.**\n\nHere is what Occidental Petroleum's Annual report has to say about what will negatively affect the chemical side of their business. I'd use the petroleum part but it's more paragraphs than this essay I'm writing for free and the overlap is high and items unmentioned in the petroleum segment make sense to include in this.\n\n>*Industry Outlook Industry performance will depend on the health of the global economy, specifically in the housing, construction, automotive and durable goods markets. Margins also depend on market supply and demand balances and feedstock and energy prices. Strengthening in the petroleum industry may positively affect the demand and pricing of a number of Occidental’s products that are consumed by industry participants. U.S. commodity export markets will continue to be impacted by the relative strength of the U.S. dollar*\n\nOk let's do a checklist and use Petroleum as the target:\n\n\\>Global economy health: literally has a virus\n\n\\>housing + construction: good but way more chemical related\n\n\\>automotive: poor to fair\n\n\\>durable goods: nobody is buying another stapler right now they're buying masks\n\n\\>supply: up\n\n\\>demand: down\n\n\\>feedstock: thats chemical shit not oil shit\n\n\\>energy prices: currently digging in the basement like that scene from war of the worlds\n\n\\>petroleum industry strength: inflation adjusted all time lows\n\n\\>strength of dollar: very high\n\nAt least they probably have a midstream section to buoy them in these dark times coming up.\n\n>In 2018, Occidental sold several assets, including the Centurion common carrier oil pipeline and storage system, Southeast New Mexico oil gathering system, and Ingleside Crude Terminal. Following the transactions, Occidental retained its long-term flow assurance, pipeline takeaway and export capacity through its retained marketing business.\n\nOh cool, looks like they started burning down the house to keep wood in the stove back in 2018 but at least they can still...get tolled by the company they sold it to first. Let's check out debt maturities:\n\n2021 1,249 — 1,249 2022 1,213 — 1,213 2023 1,213 — 1,213\n\nOh cool, with very optimistic profits of less than a billion a year and having missed the last two quarterly guidance and already running the negative, Occidental will have to do the equivalent of you taking a loan out against your entire year's salary for three years on the promise that maybe on year four you're going to hit a home run.\n\nSo what's the best case scenario?  Their colombian and omani plays are probably better than the US portions so they have some diversification. Many less than 5 bill cap us companies are pure US plays and would be better to short than this one but the clarity in their financial statements are higher so I'm shitting on these guys.  Remember when CTN wanted to short women CEO'd companies?  This is one so shout out to CTN. Capital Expenditures will decrease which will decrease their productivity and growth which will feed into itself in terms of valuation as well as increasing risk of some environmental ~~black swan~~ being too cheap for safety event.  They will at best refi their loans with more loans on top of their loans, or start stripping off assets to cash rich companies (Exxon) at a shit price since they're bent over a 35 dollar barrel of oil. Their dividend is untenable which the minute they drop that more people will leave.  In short they are stuck in a feedback loop for the foreseeable future of decreasing value as they can't even run a profit two  quarters a go at $56 for WTI - what makes you think they can compete below 45? Sure some autistic pajama trader will sell some puts for 48 and they'll be able to hedge their prices a bit but the more they hedge, the more they guarantee the doom of their American plays.  You're gonna have to look up the pure USA plays as Occidental isn't but yeah, US Oil is fucked.\n\nOh fun fact the U.S. oil industry directly makes up 7%  of the American GDP so a pull back in prices and folding of businesses to the tune of...lets go back to just 2017, will cause a textbook definition recession (quarter on quarter GDP retraction) which will cause boomers to start liquidating portfolios to save their target year retirement but maybe they'll push it back just one year to fuck you out of a promotion cause they got a 2nd house they to buy and don't want the upward mobility of some whipper snapper taking away what they deserve.  They also directly/indirectly employ 7% of the labor force too where a 2 percentage point drop off (2017  levels) in the oil industry alone would cause cascading economic systems to take a shit as the one thing every economist says that makes the U.S. economy so resilient right now is near record low unemployment, which of course is made up as fuck as you have to actively be seeking a job which trading options on robinhood apparently doesn't count as one (fuck you mom).  the only way out for US based petroleum companies is to get even more leveraged which given our banking industry has a fine tradition of lending to low-income earners to the tune of 10x their annual income for variable interest rates cuz it's a home and people always pay for their homes, I'm sure the -3x annual income loans that will be requested shortly will be promptly doled out. there will be even be analysts from the banks own risk department saying 'trust me oil will be above 70 in five years the models said so with a 3 sigma degree of probability. yes these are the same models we used 5 years ago, why do you ask?'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou may now resume the sell off thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: My dick is 100% long and I plan to initiate an even longer position later tonight.", "id": "fbhjzm", "created_utc": 1583004115.0, "score": 33, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 42, "comments": [{"body": "No one here has the brain power to read anything this long.", "score": 43, "replies": []}, {"body": "Read this whole fucking thing and didn’t see a strike/expiry.

New debts will have to be issued so that PB should continue to skew higher unless more selling occurs as they simply don't have the cash to pay it off.  If they sell assets to pay off debts, they will intrinsically hurt their book value since they will likely sell assets lower than accountant valuations due to the current market.\n\nThey're going to have to slash their dividend which always creates a price shock as they can't maintain what they are currently giving back to shareholders.\n\nTheir results per unit of production(barrel of oil) in the USA average across all of 2019 is... $.8.  Compare that to 7 in the ME and 13 in Latin America.  Averaging across all operations it is 2.7.\n\nSo we are now sub 50 for the year as an average and last year's $.8 is based off of an avg $56.
