{"title": "How to THINK Like a Trader", "selftext": "This post is adapted from the video \"10 Ways Traders THINK\" by Risk Premium. It's a list for BEGINNERS of ten ways traders think about their positions and the market, some of which are fairly obvious and some of which are a bit less intuitive. Overall the most interesting aspect of trading, in my opinion, is what sets it apart from \"investing\" in people's minds. There is inherently a lot of overlap, but the trading mindset and investing mindset are sometimes distinct. Anyhow, here are 10 things constantly on traders' minds as they go about their day in the markets. Enjoy.\n\n**10 - Traders think they know NOTHING** \n\nA good trader constantly reminds themselves that there is so much they DON’T know. Bad traders think they know everything and will constantly be surprised when things don’t work out the way they expect. Smart traders are constantly looking for ways that their ideas could be wrong, challenging themselves to see the flaws in their own thinking. The ancient Athenian philosopher Socrates was credited with immense wisdom because instead of proclaiming what he knew, he merely admitted that he knew nothing. This is how good traders need to think. For example, instead of thinking, “This stock is going to rise because product sales will hit a record next quarter” a good trader understands they CANNOT be certain about what the sales are going to be; and therefore, their attention shifts to things that could help to change their assumptions. What warning signs could they look for that would tell them product sales are not going to meet their expectations? Perhaps information from suppliers of raw material, or evidence from retail stores that confirm actual purchases. Good traders think they know NOTHING FOR CERTAIN and constantly seek to validate or reject their assumptions.\n\n**9 - Traders think about the opportunity cost of their money**\n\nA good trader understands that there are many possible trades to make at any moment, but each dollar can only be used for one trade at a time. The trader must therefore consider the other opportunities that their money could be used for, and shouldn’t make a trade that makes less profit than an alternative opportunity. For example, if the trader’s money is sitting in an investment safely making 10% each year, they shouldn’t take any other trade unless the expected profit is more than 10%. Whatever is the trader’s best, safe alternative for their money at any time represents the opportunity cost of their money. A good trader knows their opportunity cost and constantly deploys their money in the best trades available to them at any time.\n\n**8 - Traders think losses are inevitable**\n\nBad traders expect to win with every trade, and are therefore surprised when they sometimes make losses. Good traders, on the other hand, know to expect occasional losses. Smart traders understand that the market is outside of their control, and their only job is to win more than they lose—NOT to stop losing entirely. In fact, many good traders intentionally take many trades that will be almost surely lose, as long the reward for winning on just one of the trades is so great that it will make up for all the other losses. This is especially the case with options traders, who sometimes create trades that will lose money week after week, until one day, the trade makes back all of the losses plus a large profit. Traders who think that losses are inevitable will not be surprised by anything the market throws at them. \n\n**7 - Traders think in terms of risk and reward**\n\nProfitable traders understand that every asset can go up or down, and that the probabilities of moving higher or lower can be different. Taken together, the potential increase in the price, multiplied by the probability of the increase happening, represents the potential reward of betting on the asset. On the other hand, the potential decrease in the price, multiplied by the probability of the decline happening, represents the risk of betting on the asset. It takes skill and practice to estimate how high or low an asset could go, and what the probabilities are of each outcome, but getting it right is something that traders take very seriously. Good traders only make bets when the potential reward outweighs the potential risk.\n\n**6 - Traders think the market’s purpose is to send price signals**\n\nA lot of people think the market is just a place for buyers and sellers to meet and transact. But good traders understand that the market’s purpose isn’t just to get transactions completed, it’s to clarify at what price the transaction happens. In the stock market, this price is publicly available for all to see, and it sends a valuable signal to all different parts of the economy. When stocks are valued highly, they send a signal to entrepreneurs to start new companies in that sector or industry, which increases competition and makes the economy more efficient. When stocks are valued low, they send a signal that companies might be better off breaking up into pieces and selling them off individually, which discourages the formation of large companies and may slow the economy. Good traders use the signals from stock prices and pair them with signals about the economy in order to make better decisions about their trades. For example, if a trader thinks the economy is running at an unsustainably high pace, then high-priced stocks may be overvalued as the economy will eventually slow down, so the trader may want to sell. But if stocks are highly priced and the economy still has room to expand in a sustainable way, it might be a good idea to keep owning those stocks. Outside of the stock market, in the commodities market, for example, prices also send valuable signals. When the price of oil is low, it sends a signal to oil producers to stop drilling wells, which lowers supply. Low prices also encourage people to use more oil, which increases demand. When supply gets low enough and demand gets high enough, traders then place bets on a recovery in oil price. Smart traders use the signals that prices tell them about assets and combine them with other information in order to come up with sound trading strategies. \n\n**5 - Traders think about the risk of their entire portfolio, not just the risk of each individual position**\n\nThis is important. Bad traders think of each of their trades as individual positions with their own risk and reward characteristics. This is true, but it’s an incomplete picture and good traders know how to broaden their scope of understanding. Good traders look at the overall characteristics of the entire portfolio, including the ways in which different trades interact and relate to each other. For example, buying several stocks in the same sector, such as technology, will create a portfolio in which all of the trades move in a similar fashion. This portfolio will have a similar risk and reward profile to any one of the individual trades within in. On the other hand, buying stocks across multiple different sectors assures the trader that their entire portfolio has different characteristics than any single trade within it. Good traders determine how the addition of a new trade will impact their entire portfolio’s risk and return profile, instead of just considering the trade on its own merits. \n\n**4 - Traders think about the worst that could happen**\n\nThe worst possible thing that can happen to a trader is that their trades go so badly, they lose the ability to make new trades. The most direct way this happens is by losing all of the money they have to trade with. Preventing this from happening is always on the mind of good trader. Smart traders prepare for the worst by having a plan to exit positions before losses become unsurmountable. For many traders, this involves implementing what is called a stop-loss, or an automatic sell order that gets triggered if an asset they’ve bought dips below a certain price level. By using stop-losses appropriately, good traders are prepared for the worst.\n\n**3 - Traders think good news can be bad news and bad news can be good news**\n\nBad traders often get hung up on the news flow about the assets they trade, eager to buy when there is good news and sell when there is bad news. But good traders know that the news alone can be misleading. After all, what moves the price of stock, for example, isn’t whether the news is good or bad. It’s how good or bad the news was, relative to what was expected. Say, for instance, a popular new clothing brand is about to release its earnings figures. Everyone expects sales to be up from the previous quarter. However, when it’s revealed that sales increased 20%, the stock plummets. Why? Rising sales is always good news, but the markets was probably expecting even better news. For traders, news is only good if it’s better than what was expected. Likewise, bad news is only actually bad if it’s worse than what was expected. Smart traders understand the difference, and don’t get caught wrong-footed by buying and selling incorrectly with every new article that comes out.\n\n**2 - Traders think companies, executives, and reporters sometimes stretch the truth or spread rumors**\n\nNaive traders take everything they read at face value. If a penny stock company says it’s going be worth $10 billion dollars some day, these un-savvy traders take them at their word any buy blindly. Good traders understand that everything they hear and read has to be taken with a grain of salt. These smart traders are always asking themselves, what is the motivation of the person expressing a particular opinion? Do they have something to gain by convincing me that a certain trade is a good or bad investment? Even other traders can be the source of misinformation. There is a phrase used to describe traders who try to convince you to make the same trades they have themselves. It’s called “talking their book.” Their book, or portfolio of trades, would perform better if everyone bought what they bought and sold what they sold. Traders who talk their book are only trying to convince others to make the same trades they’ve made; their not necessarily trying to give anyone accurate or useful information. That’s why smart traders think other people are not always completely honest, and act accordingly.\n\n**1 - Traders think that no one is responsible for their success and failure except themselves**\n\nA bad trader will find someone or someTHING to blame when their trades go wrong. Maybe they blame the management of a company they invested in when the company doesn’t perform as well as they expected. After all, it’s the company’s fault that it’s not doing well, right? Of course, but it’s not the company’s fault that the trader decided to buy the stock. If the trader had done better research, they could have uncovered clues that the company’s management team was unlikely to perform at the desired level. Good traders know that ultimately, the performance of their trades is up to them and only them. No one else is responsible for the trader’s positions. No one else can be held accountable when the trader loses money. This can be a tough pill to swallow for some traders, but when it’s embraced, it’s actually quite liberating. It means that traders are 100% in control of their own destiny. And that’s one of the greatest things about being a trader.\n\n**That's it.

Is that enough to cut back some $10-15k of production costs? Seems a bit tight to me. Cameras/radar and a basic infotainment/screen have got to remain, software add-ons will play a significant role in the product's margin. Otherwise a Cybercar is my wettest dream but given Elon's comment that it is very hard to make, it might be a production hell they'll want to avoid for now (tho capex is about 10x lower according to Munro) until CT is smoothed out.

It works for EVs in general, not for the 3 specifically (unless you compare it to $25ish k new ICE car which I am not doing).

My daily practice focuses on real property, commercial lending, secured and un-secured transactions, and regulatory compliance in the banking and financial sectors.  I regularly advice banks and other institutional lenders and developers (and sometimes borrowers) in connection with these transactions.  The majority of the lending work I handle is secured by commercial property in NYC.  I sometimes provide general corporate and employment advice, but this is not my area of expertise, yet these topics do come up frequently.\n\nMy every day practice doesn't cross paths with securities law.  But, I do advise banks about how certain securities regulations (Reg. U and/or Reg W) or other federal statutes related to securities may expose the bank to liability should a borrower decide to invest in margin stocks (read: YOLO the loan proceeds on some TSLA Fds.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nA note about timing:  I work full time and have two kids.

Once arbitrators agree that the misconduct of a broker and/or the brokerage firm caused losses to the customer, they often consider mitigating factors so that customers don't receive everything they are seeking, such as:   \n>  \n>• **the customer not taking action sooner,**   \n>  \n>• the customer's unquestioning blind faith that should not be rewarded,   \n>  \n>• “well-managed damages” that are too speculative and not really related to this particular customer's investment history and, frankly,  \n>  \n> • whether they like the customer and feel sorry for him or her.\n\nThe portion in bold may suggest closing for a loss, as soon as you reasonably could close the position, to limit your damages.  Some contract laws also require the non-breaching party to mitigate its losses when the contact is breached.\n\nFailure to mitigate losses will be a defense employed regardless of when you close these trades.
