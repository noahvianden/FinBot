{"title": "Y2k..2k Bug and It's Impackts on Markets", "selftext": "**Assumption:**  Markets are Efficient, Code is Bug-Free\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs you guys can see from my post history, I'm slightly retarded and have been going down the rabbit hole of Machine Learning and AI.\n\nWe all know that bots run the market\n\nBots are not what you think they are.  They are not some all-knowing AI that knows you better than your Wife's BF.  There are hundreds of thousands of them... each programmed for a specific task.  To watch a specific security, trend, twitter feed.  Some are smart, using ML to make decisions based on sets of streaming data.  Some are dumb, if price is X when VWAP is Y, SELL.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe problem with all of this is that an **OVERWHELMING** majority of these bots.  Especially the bots that are of the more recent generation, are trained using a technique called reinforcement learning.  Reinforcement learning is a technique where you let the bot run free in a playground of data.  You give it 100k, tell it what it can do.. Buy sell. blah blah... and let it take actions.  Over and over and over again.  Like your wife's BF when you're out for the afternoon working on the boat.  Except.. it's in a gat damn computer with 16 GPUs that costs $238,000 so it can fumble around on replays of the market for millions of life-years while it slowly gets smarter every time it gets its virtual asshole burned by buying FDs on OTM SLV calls.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**What does this mean?:**\n\nWe are about to cross into the unknown.  I've researched the Bellamn equation [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation), which is the underlying equation for RL.  Its what dictates how these bots learn, how they replay time, and how they update themselves.  I've also read ML papers published by JPM [link](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/pjorion/files/2018/05/JPM-2017-MachineLearningInvestments.pdf). What I've noticed is that most, if not all of JPMs \"Bots\" are modifying this equation so it can be efficiently replayed for these agents to learn on based on historical data.\n\nI've found several cases where THE EQUATION WILL DIVIDE BY 0 once we cross over into ATHs.  This will occur exactly at 3397.6.  Effectively crashing every single \"agent\" that has been trained in the last few years using this method.\n\nI'm calling this the Y2k2k bug.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMeyn, Sean (2008).
