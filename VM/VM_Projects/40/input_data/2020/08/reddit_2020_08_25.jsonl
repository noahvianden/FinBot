BigCommerce merchants can be among the first  to adopt the new feature, which provides shoppers an intuitive,  seamless and secure way to purchase products they discover on Instagram  in a few clicks, without leaving the app.\n\nLeveraging  BigCommerce’s native integration with Facebook Commerce Manager,  merchants can easily connect their ecommerce storefront’s catalog to  Instagram and give customers the ability to buy from their favorite  brands directly on Instagram—rather than navigating to a brand’s website  to make a purchase—and pay using PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, American  Express or Discover. After placing an order, customers can also use the  Instagram app to view their order status, estimated delivery date and  tracking number, as well as cancel orders, initiate returns or request  additional support.\n\n\"Creating  a streamlined checkout experience is paramount for merchants looking to  social commerce to drive revenue growth. The rollout of checkout on  Instagram is another significant step in Instagram’s evolution toward  becoming an essential commerce channel for customer-focused brands,\"  said Brent Bellm, chief executive officer at BigCommerce. \"BigCommerce  is proud to be one of a select group of partners to offer their  customers access to this innovative new feature at launch.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bigcommerce-teams-facebook-unlock-checkout-150500474.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bigcommerce-teams-facebook-unlock-checkout-150500474.html)", "id": "ige901", "created_utc": 1598368995.0, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 46, "comments": [{"body": "I'm so fucking glad I didn't try to sell any calls holy fuck", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "This is fake news, Instagram is allowing all US based businesses to do checkout thru Instagram.

It flies at mach 1.6 (M at sea level) or around 530 m/s. It's funny you come up with the same mach number because I derived it separately. \n\nAnyways the big problem with mach 3+ is the energy you need to even get up to that speed, plus the additional potential energy to get the altitude. Let's say your battery is 70% of take off mass and you have 500 Wh/kg, your plane now carries 1.26 MJ per kilogram of plane. To get up to mach 3 (around 1000 m/s) you need a kinetic energy of 0.5 MJ and that is without efficiency losses. Then you have potential energy, let's say you get to 30.000 meters, now your kilogram requires another 0.3 MJ for a total of 0.8 MJ/kg. If you look at the efficiency chain:\n\nBattery: 0.98\nWirings/power electronics: 0.97\nMotor: 0.97\nFan (1 stage): 0.92\nPropulsive efficiency (momentum exchange with air): roughly 0.85\nTotal: 0.84\n\nYou're now at 1.11 MJ/kg just getting up to altitude and speed and you can't use the (s)ramjet to do this so you'll need double propulsion systems.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Hmm, I think you're right about that kinetic energy point. \n\nAnd mostly looked at the propulsion and basic aerodynamic drag calculations. If you take Concorde shape and mass and fill it up with 50% batteries and 400 Wh/kg you get 111,000 kg and 22.2 MWh battery capacity. \n\nAscending to 130k feet takes 12 MWh, but I didn't actually think just accelerating would be significant and just looked at steady state, but just going to Mach 5 would be 45 MWh, so that kinda kills it with only 400 Wh/kg. \n\nI updated the whole thing calculate engine efficiency, kinetic energy and also added this calculation for empirically measured max L/D ratio by mach speed\n\n[http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/waverider/design.shtml](http://www.aerospaceweb.org/design/waverider/design.shtml)\n\nThis is only valid for higher Mach numbers that don't mess with the sound barrier, so don't look too closely at the lowest values. \n\n [calculations & output](https://i.imgur.com/bhpOumJ.png) \n\nI couldn't tell you the math reason propulsion efficiency ends up being the same for any altitude, but it is. Air intake area is like extremely important and really changes everything. \n\n [24 Vs. 6 m\\^2 Air intake](https://i.imgur.com/3lOOSXt.png) \n\nLatest gen high-bypass turbofans have like a 198 cm fan diameter, so 1 meter radius, π m\\^2 and with 4 of those engines you get 12 m\\^2 intake, it's possible. All your aerodynamic variables should change with a bigger intake area, but it's just using Concorde aerodynamics, so too scared to really touch that and sticking with 12 m\\^2. \n\nWith that it ends up being worse for range to fly higher up. And yeah, Mach 2.6 @ 105k feet is really the max you can go with the battery when it's 50% of mass with 400 Wh/kg. \n\nI guess that puts it in range of turbofans, if that Boom jet is able to use them up to Mach 2.2 over turbojets. Guess it's kinda nice because electric turbofans are a lot easier to do. Kinda boring though. \n\nAs for using up most of the battery ascending and accelerating, it doesn't really matter. You're still storing up the energy stored in the plane. You could really just glide and slowly convert your potential energy into kinetic, then also slowly lose kinetic energy against air drag. \n\nIf your range actually gets better as you fly lower, it really doesn't matter. Boost up to Mach 2.6 @ 105k feet, save like 14% battery for landing and just glide. Originally you would have gotten 2,800 km total range, as you drop to 98k feet it's 3,200 km, at 92k feet 3,600 km. \n\nJust from that glide you've expended energy equal to 32% of the total battery capacity in the plane. Still getting great range efficiency all the way. Once you drop down to, in this, 75k feet you're gonna start hitting the sound barrier and it's gonna wreck your day in air resistance.\n\nIf you want to compare it to a Tesla model S, then the Concorde took 128 people and just counting 1 person in a Model S, then you get this airplane would get 1150 miles on a 100 kWh battery per seat. It's pretty damn efficient. \n\nBut yeah, I do think turbofans makes more sense for this. Although if you do get to 1200 Wh/kg then you would have enough energy to go all the way up to Mach 5.4 where where you'd probably want a scramjet. \n\nTraveling 6,000 km at Mach 5.4 in 1 hour, sounds a lot more fun than 10,800 km at Mach 1.7 in 6 hours.

Fuel load is calculated based on the weight and trip requirements. It is common for a 6 seat light airplane to turn into a 1 or 2 seat airplane if you fill the tanks to 100%. If you want to use all the seats you have to leave off some fuel and fly a shorter distance. With a battery, you can't do that, so the tanks are \"full\" all the time at takeoff and at landing.  That means either a much larger, more expensive aircraft to carry the same amount or a much lower payload.\n\nMany aircraft are designed to assume that the landing weight will be less because you've consumed hundreds of pounds of fuel. Therefore, they have a maximum landing weight. With batteries, the maximum landing weight will be the same as the maximum take-off weight. That means that the landing gear may have to be upgraded which, in turn, means more weight.\n\nAnd that doesn't get us into the problems created by the need to draw power at 60 - 80% of the motor's maximum for the entire duration of the flight. A modern automobile is running at under 20% of maximum rated power when it's cruising down the road. It only taps more when it needs bursts of acceleration. An aircraft needs power supplied steadily for the entire flight and that means it consumes energy quickly, whether it's fuel or electricity. A light aircraft, though faster than a car, often gets the equivalent of 12 - 15 miles/gallon.\n\nOh, and the FAA. Certifying a new aircraft engine is not impossible, but even if you do, you won't sell a billion dollars worth of engines very quickly. It's hard to recoup that kind of investment. See Honda's HondaJet. It took them 13 years and a billion dollars to get it into production and they've only sold 150 of them over the last 4 years or so.
