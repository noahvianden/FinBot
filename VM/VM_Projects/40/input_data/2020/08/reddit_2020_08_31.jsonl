{"title": "Decided to hold my WMT and MSFT calls, wondering if it was a mistake", "selftext": "Position:\n\nWMT 140C 9/11 \n\nMSFT 230C 9/18\n\nI bought those calls on Friday, it's now down 40%, I had a chance to walk away today with a 20% loss (2k) but I decided to hold, I still think the deal will go through, here is my analysis:\n\n* From the point of view of POTUS, banning Tiktok or forcing Tiktok to be sold to American are both viable options. It will most likely draw him more support in the election since Tiktok users are probably going to vote against him anyway \n\n* It is very unlikely that Tiktok can win its lawsuit, and everyone is well aware of that\n\n* Banning Tiktok will not hurt US's interests to any extend (unlike huaiwei and zte, where you can see multiple extensions were given to them, and there were much more resistances), after Tiktok is banned, their marketshare will be gobbled up by other companies like facebook\n\n* Tiktok has no bargaining power because of what is said above, and it is running out of time\n\n* Tiktok has a good algorithm to provide personalized feed, this is part that China require a license to export. Many people thinks that without this algorithm, Tiktok is just an empty shell. I disagree with that, this algorithm is most likely just one micro service from the entire cloud infrastructure. Their data, users (existing market share)  are more valuable assets.\n\n* If facebook can create a Tiktok rip off, microsoft should not have much difficulty with integration  \n\n* $30 billion is a lot of money for any company, if Tiktok is outright banned, there is nothing that could be recovered, I do not believe Bytedance and its investors will allow it to die like this when there are better options\n\n* Believe it or not, the Chinese government is here to serve the interest of Chinese companies. In my opinion, the announcement on Aug 28th is to help Tiktok to gain more bargaining power, since they are most likely facing pressure to sell off their AI algorithms as well. \n\n* If I was the CEO of ByteDance, I would want this to be over sooner rather than later, as time approaches the deadline, they have more to lose than Microsoft/Oracle. And if Tiktok is banned for a few days, they will lose a large portion if not all of their market share, since there is no royalty in this sort of business\n\n* Oracle is less likely to win due to a couple of reasons, 1. WMT decided to partner with MSFT not ORCL. 2. ByteDance is facing pressure from the Chinese market as well, selling the company with close relationship with the POTUS can have negative affects to the domestic market\n\nOf course, there are a lot of risks and uncertainties as well, notably:\n\n* Somehow Oracle won the bid, the I would probably lose all my money\n\n* I don't know what is a likelihood that an extension would be given to Tiktok, since their strategy can be to drag this on, this is probably the highest risk that would mess up with my calls. However, a few days ago, Tiktok reassured their employees more \"clarity\" for their future (https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/tiktok-executives-reassure-employees-after-ceo-exit-1.1485955)\n\n* ByteDance is criticized for begin too soft (when in reality they really have no control over the situation), and Chinese consumers threaten to boycott Douyin (chinese TikTok) if Tiktok was sold to an American company\n\nEdit: Still no news from tiktok, a lot of people want to sell by wednesday, so I gotta sell before they do, Closed off both positions with a little gain", "id": "ik7utu", "created_utc": 1598912005.0, "score": 1, "upvote_ratio": 0.53, "num_comments": 45, "comments": [{"body": "Have you ever invested in msft before?

The moves from Beijing ensnare TikTok and potential American buyers including Microsoft and Oracle, wedging them in the middle of a tussle between the United States and China over the future of global technology. Beijing’s displeasure alone could scare off TikTok’s suitors, many of whom have operations in China.
