Interest rates are at (or near) 0, and will be well into the foreseeable future. So issue #1 is taken care of. Even if mortgage defaults happen, the Fed is buying MBS. No threat to the banking system then, which is the backbone of the financial world. So issue #2 is take care of as well. Regarding stimulus - the Fed literally said they won't stop. So that takes care of the supply side of things. The government tends to always drag their heels on handouts to citizens. But in an election year? That shit **will** pass. And even after the election, I think the virus ramps up even more during the winter. No way the government stops handing out money, even if Biden is elected. In fact, if Democrats win, handouts to everyone. Even if Republicans win, the situation will be so bad they'll have no choice but to continue with stimulus checks. So, the demand side is taken care of, and hence issue #3 is taken care of. Lastly, most people are making more money from unemployment (state + federal) than they were when they were working. So, why would they stop spending? Consumers very likely see this as a (somewhat) short term event. So instead of trying to save most of their stimulus checks + unemployment dollars, they went about their spending habits as usual. That takes care of issue #4.\n\nThis entire things rests on the Fed and the government. As long as the money is coming in for both the supply and demand side, the market will go up, at least in the short term.\n\nWe've never been down this path before. I'm not sure how the Fed plans to handle a few trillion being pumped into the market/economy without causing damage **long term**. But I'm sure they'll figure that out. It's not like the oversight committee will really investigate, and even if they do, we'll never know the true $ amount that was pumped into the market. So, hyperinflation is also taken care of.
