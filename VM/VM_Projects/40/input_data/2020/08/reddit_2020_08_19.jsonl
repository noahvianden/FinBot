Options is a financial derivative created for hedging in the first place, not for making money. So, if you're confident about direction, but not about date, I'd keep shares instead. The same is about averaging down, **shares are more reliable long term**.\n2. The **benefit of the credit spread** is that you still have a leverage of the option, but don't have to worry about theta decay before the expiration date. Both, short and long legs, will depreciate approximately with the same speed. So, to some extent, spread make your position in options act more like a position in stocks.\n3. The **advantage of the calendar spread**, i.e. buying long term and selling short term, is that short term has more residual premium than the long term. In other words, 1 month is 4 weeks, but if you buy 1 monthly option and sell 1 weekly option every week, you make money, because 1 monthly < 4 weekly.\n\nTLDR get shares instead of options or sell puts instead\n\nP.

If the trade that I bought at the bottom is down more than 30% one week out of exp, I would think that there is something I don’t understand controlling the underlying or something horrible has gone wrong.

I would check the fundamentals (Greeks), check the horizon of the underlying, check the technicals and if I don’t have enough confidence the underlying will moon then it’s time to cut losses here.

They are the biggest company in the world because they are making money hand over fist from the Apple platform that they have created. Telsa is creating a very similar platform from which other revenue sources with much higher margins will grow and that is what the bears don't seem to see yet.
