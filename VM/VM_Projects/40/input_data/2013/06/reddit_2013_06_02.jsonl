I'd say they've even surpassed them, given their new ability to totally master the layout of the oils they're creating. \n\nThat's revolutionary technology, and it's easy to see why so many of the world's leading companies are rushing out to make joint venture projects with Solazyme. And those JV's are further validation of SZYM's tech, incidentally. \n\nThe risks are the price and availability of sugar, that competition could undercut them, and that their tech might not scale up. If they can avoid these traps, they've a powerhouse in the making - and I think they can, and here's why. \n\n1) Sugar isn't a big problem. It's price has been trending downward for over a year, back down to very profitable levels for SZYM's processes. Even if the price doubled, they'd be profitable, and that won't happen soon. They have variable feedstocks sources they can use, and are certainly looking into futuristic alternatives as well. And they've partnered up with Bunge, a pretty smart move to ensure a smooth supply of sugar down in South America. \n\n2) Competition might be able to sell cheaper beauty products, flour, palm oil, diesel, etc. But they won't be making higher quality products, because Solazyme is making ideal versions of oils. You want a higher quality oil? Pay Monsanto for 5 years to make it 30% better, or pay Solazyme for 6 months and it'll be ideal. That's the advantage they have working with their patented technology that has broken the genome for algae. There will always be a high-margin market for the top-shelf products, and that's what they're tapping into. And if their first real product, Algenist, is any indication, everything is looking great for revenue and margins. Unless someone else comes up with better game-changing technology in a whole lot of fields, they'll be fine. Their process is very versatile, and can switch out production to different oils in days, not months. \n\n3) Scaling up has worked out fine so far. It could be a problem, certainly, but there's no particular reason to assume it will be. Their big JV partners are certainly investing towards a future where they scale up big, and the next couple years should see humongous revenue growth as their facilities come online around the globe.\n\nOnce they've got real income, which should be steadily increasing over the next two years, their current market cap will look ludicrously cheap. And they'll likely keep pumping all their profits into increasing production for many years to come, leading to a stock chart showing 30-60% annual gains for the next 5-10 years. That'd be $500 a share in 10 years time (assuming 45%), which is only a $45b market cap (factoring in dilution). \n\nAt 15x P/E, a $45b market cap is only asking for $3b in annual profits, which is only between $5-7b in sales at their assumed margins. I don't think that's unreasonable to imagine at all.
