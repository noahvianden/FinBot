{"title": "My analysis on Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) and why I bought a lot of it.", "selftext": "On Feb 1, XOM started falling pretty hard. A combination of wider market turmoil, a 10% oil plunge, an earnings miss, and the company's plans to raise capex for long-term investments, made it go from $89 to $74 in less than a week. \n\nRight now it's at $74.30. The total decline from Feb 1 is at -16.6% It has stabilized over the past month or so in that trading range from $73 - $76. \n\nI think XOM is a buy though because first of all, right now its dividend is at 4%, a high (they have increased the dividend for 20+ years straight). Second of all, it has a history of being extremely resilient. When the oil crash in 2014 happened, XOM only fell by 30% at most. Other companies went bankrupt or fell by 80%+. It has tended to recover quickly from levels in the $70 range and go into the 80s. \n\nSecond of all, right now it's at a 5-year low at that price, even though the company's fundamentals haven't really changed. It was just a perfect storm of various factors that sent the price diving. \n\nAnd the cherry on the top is that the downside at this point is limited. If it slips below $70 into the 60's, it would be approaching 10-year lows. That's hard to imagine unless there's a fundamental change in the company. \n\nI've bought stock at the $74/$75 levels. My plan is to hold for 5 years, or until it hits over $90, and keep collecting the 4% dividend. I think temporarily, the price has been sent down, but over the long term, recovery is almost guaranteed. \n\nAnyone have any thoughts on this stock?", "id": "85u7ih", "created_utc": 1521564331.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 42, "comments": [{"body": "Its hard for me to be bullish on the price of oil when things like fracking and natural gas are dragging its price down in the long term.

Less than a decade later, oil would hit $40/barrel, and people couldn't believe they'd see oil at those levels again. \n\nBut my point is not that Exxon is a good buy just because of oil prices. It is a good buy for the price of oil *right now and factoring in lower levels*. Exxon is cheap.

Will they be able to do it all to a 'T'? Many are skeptical, but I believe they will. They're making investments and have a history of return on their capex. That's part of why they've gone down. They're using that money in long term investments rather than just pumping it back into stock buy backs and dividends (which is what they've been doing for the past decade).  \n\nThe 2.8% bond is safer, but also will *severely* underperform a blue chip stock.

It's just a cyclical market. Nobody could have predicted the crash in 2014, just like few will predict the rise that will happen when it inevitably does. Already oil has risen over 30% from its lows. And by the way, a conflict or war could easily break out in an oil producing country that sends the price skyrocketing. \n\nOil is known to be very hard to predict. The good news is that XOM is a very conservative company and accounts for oil in the 40's when it does things. \n\nThe fact that they went down 30% at most when their peers went down 40% or even 50% or 80%, or bankruptcy for smaller companies, shows me that this is a resilient company. \n\nI understand your negativity but I can't help but feel that we are at oversold levels particularly in XOM and the time to buy has come.
