One thing I hate even more than losses is missed profits! Meaning, when I take profits too early and the stock just keeps rising and I leave so much money on the table. \n\nI fixed the problem one simple way. Setting alerts! So when I place a trade, I immediately set an alert on when I am up $1000 on the trade. \n\nOnce I am up $1000 on a trade, instead of taking profits, I set a stop order to close the trade when the stock falls to where I'm up $500.\n\nIf it never falls enough for the stop order to trigger and lock in a $500 profit, I let it ride to the closing bell.\n\nPERFECT example is the SPY trade on Friday. Got the alert when I was up a grand, placed a stop order to close the trade when I'm only up $500, and just left it alone until 3:55 PM.\n\nDidn't take profits too early and as a result made an extra $2500.
