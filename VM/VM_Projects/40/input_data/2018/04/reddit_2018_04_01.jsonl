If NVDA/AMD doesn't do this, they have the potential of losing revenue for 3 quarters. Whereas a buyback program they might lose revenue for 1 quarter. Most PC gamers are hawking eBay for used cards, same with custom built PCs. No one wants to buy a $600 GPU for $1200... Unless they think they are getting rich off  crypto.

Also, a gamer is willing to pay $200 certified used refurbished vs. An overclocked non certified mining card for $50. Any card being sold uncertified used during a buyback program is likely assumed to be garbage. Plus, if certified used is $200, and brand new is $300, most might opt for the brand new.
