The traditional auto' P/E ratios are all very low because most people expect they'll have to sink a bunch of money into changing to electric, and even then their sales will probably decline. Between autonomy, Uber, Tesla and a bunch of other factors gas car ownership has probably already peaked, IMHO\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso Tesla makes more money on vehicles than the others. Ford released their numbers are Tesla's margins are about double. That's tricky to compare too because Ford do make great margins on trucks, and awful margins on smaller vehicles, but still. If Tesla and Ford earned the same revenue Tesla would make more profit, and be a higher valued stock\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEnergy is a whole other category that the other players don't have\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd lastly P/E ratios are usually based heavily on future earnings. Netflix is not a car company but it's the best example out there. It's earnings are pretty bad but it's stock is sky high because they keep acquiring new customers. Amazon has a really high P/E ratio too, largely because it keeps growing. People are buying those stocks because of what they think those companies will be in 10 years.
