Ways I can see MoviePass making money:\n\n* Percent of concession sales by MoviePass goers. The CEO said they'll soon have a way to track concession sales by MoviePass subscribers. That data would all but guarantee them a place at the table for negotiating a percent of concession sales. \n\n* Selling ads in app. \n\n* Selling merch in app. The CEO said they have a 5-8% sales rate selling merch in app, historically. (Can you imagine a partnership with Disney selling Star Wars toys in app? Because I can.)\n\n* Partnerships with studios to push movies, and...\n\n* Partnerships with theaters to send moviegoers to their theaters: \n\n>Ted Farnsworth: As the CEO of a data analytics company, I can tell you that the data is incredible. MoviePass is able to influence which movies their customers go to see. They can also influence where they go to see it... and when. It's brilliant.\n\n>Mark Gomes: So, you’re able to influence which movies people attend and optimize the filling of cinema seats?\n\n>Ted Farnsworth: Exactly. So we've been approached by many of the major studios in L.A. We’ll be out there for a series of meetings in early October.\n\nSame source as above. \n\n* MoviePass credit cards. CEO: \"Ted Farnsworth: Sure. We're looking to turn them into regular credits cards. We can get a major bank to sponsor the card, so there'll be no cost to us. Plus, they'll pay us a commission for acquisition. As it stands, it pay hundreds of dollars to acquire each customer.\" Same source as above. \n\n* Integrate other apps. If you click through to Spotify from a MoviePass Soundtrack, MP gets a %. \n\n* Become a bridge for distribution between theaters and new media content creators. Amazon, Hulu and Netflix have kept their movies out of theaters to a) encourage subscriptions, and b) avoid promotional costs to fill seats. If MoviePass checks that you have the requisite subscription, and you can only buy the ticket through MoviePass (logistics of that would need to be worked out), and MoviePass guarantees a certain number of fixed seats, the big companies might go wide using MoviePass after all. \n\n* Create content yourself, i.e. TV. \n\n* and my favorite: Opening their own theaters in underserved areas with 0-1 theaters, simply to increase the number of subscribers. In doing so, they would negotiate with studios to remit a much smaller percent of ticket sales in these theaters than abnormal theater would, under the premise that the audience wouldn't have seen the movie if it wasn't for MoviePass, so any money the studios get is free money. MP would keep a much larger % of ticket sales than other theaters. \n\n* Alternatively: acquire a movie chain and do their job better than them, or open competing theaters. \n\nOther wacky out there ideas:\n\n* Partner with sports leagues to get big games shown on a big screen. People might not want to pay $12/ticket to see a game that's free to watch at home, but if it's already \"free\" since you have MoviePass and already paid and already saw your one requisite movie, maybe the theater would be a cool place to watch Game 7 of the Finals.  \n\n* Partner with concert halls to help sell concert tickets. \"Just select the concert in your MoviePass app, select the tickets you want, and that amount will be automatically loaded to your MoviePass card.\" Maybe they get 25% off too. \n", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "I am also a subscriber to the service and wanted to point out that MoviePass's current structure will never make them money. \n\nThe key to their success is growing the number of subscribers to a point where they can have leverage over the theaters to demand MoviePass receive some type of kickback for their users attending showings (they can boost this by saying their users out of pocket expense is less on the ticket, therefore they're more likely to purchase concessions where the theater has a higher margin).", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "you mean the stock thats down 75% from its ATH?
