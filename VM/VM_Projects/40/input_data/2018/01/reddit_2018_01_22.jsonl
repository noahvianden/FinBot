And they recently bought a stake in Sun Art right after they started recognizing revenue for which the cash has been spent a long time ago. The other large shareholder in Sun Art is Auchan, whose owners got raided by police in Luxembourg, Belgium and France in 2016 for on suspicion of fraud, so it'll be interesting to see how that case works out. \n\nThis is all the public, easily confirmable stuff that anyone who invests in them should have come across.
