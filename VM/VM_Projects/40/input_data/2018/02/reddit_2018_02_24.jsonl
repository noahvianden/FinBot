The problem that you guys often overlook is that *sometimes* the people predicting things have a good logical argument for why they think certain things will play out the way they will. In that case, does it matter if they have been right or wrong before? Take the argument, strip out who it came from, and consider it on its own merits.\n\nI'm in med school and we have a lab test we do to see if someone has lupus or not. It's about 80% accurate at telling us if a person has lupus or not, but someone without training couldn't use it because it also gives positive results a lot of the time when they *don't* have the disease. Having said, that if your doctor administered this test to you and it came back positive, and with his training, he told you that he's sure you have lupus, would you call it a coincidence if he was right? Of course not. Sure, he could have been wrong, but he followed an algorithm that has a reasonable level of accuracy, and he did this so that *if* he's right, you can begin treatment before more problems show up. \n\nSome economic indicators have a *reasonable* accuracy in predicting a recession if someone knows what *other factors* to take into consideration. This is the basis of a lot of Ray Dalio's \"*How the Economic Machine Works*\" paper. You can't say debt/GDP hit this specific level, so recession. But what you can say is that debt/GDP hit this level and then these other factors, such as a sharp increase in energy prices catalyzed a recession in the past 3/4 times, so it's highly likely to do the same again *given these other criteria are met*.\n\nIf I make a reasonable argument for a sharp 20% correction *tomorrow* and you can't see why the argument is flawed, maybe the best course of action isn't to throw your hands up and say \"no one can predict these things,\" maybe it's to make sure that just on the off chance that I'm right, you'll be protected. What's the down-side of being protected when things look too frothy? You take a 1% haircut on your yearly P/L because you wasted that money on a put? Seems like a reasonable price to pay to have peace of mind, if nothing else.\n\nI just don't understand the logic a lot of people have on this sub where they see someone who was wrong in predicting something in the past and they automatically assume they will forever be wrong in everything they say.

When I was watching the trading on Friday, I noticed the ES futures were consistently traded less than SPX.  Sometimes by as much as a buck or two and I realized something.  If someone had a short interest in the market (say if bridgewater's short position extended to the largest US companies), and wanted to use someone else's money for additional leverage they could open large quantities of short positions on ES at market price to drive the price down?  Arbitrage bots would then step in, buy the futures and sell the underlying (all components of SPX) to drive spx' s price down and raise the futures price so they match.  So if there's a 5% margin requirement, the hedge fund or large player can get 20:1 leverage on their ability to drive the price of the market down.  On Friday I noticed that whenever spx got near 2730 there was a big spike downwards like a big player was trying to hold it down.  Once 2730 broke, it appeared like a short squeeze happened as the price rocketed up 15+ points in under an hour.  If someone had a short position in many of spx's largest companies (Apple, msft, fb, jpm, brk, etc) would it be legal for them to use 20:1 arbitrage bot leverage in the ES futures market to try and manipulate the share price of their shorts downwards?", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Your last posts were between 2-6 years ago.
