I want to address the question above because I see it frequently and it is something everyone should understand before investing.  When it comes to value of a company, the share price is 100% meaningless.  When looking at the face value of a company, the easiest way to view their size is by looking at their market cap.  \n\nTwo companies could have a market cap of $100,000 (we'll assume they're very small companies).  If Company A issued 100,000 shares, their share price would be $1. If Company B issued 1,000 shares, their share price would be $100. That doesn't mean that Company B is worth 100x of Company A's value, it just means that there are fewer shares so each share is worth more. \n\nLooking at Tesla, it is worth $5b more than Ford, but worth $8b less than Honda, $11b less than GM, and $163b less than Toyota (side note, Im shocked Toyota is worth that much more than the rest).
