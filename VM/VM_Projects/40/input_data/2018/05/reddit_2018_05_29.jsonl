Tech, on the other hand, had largely led the moves down over the last couple of months, and was not often mentioned as a place to be. Energy earnings are, as expected, showing tremendous growth, which is hardly surprising if you so much as glance at a chart showing oil prices, while early in the season most financial firms did reveal the expected increase in trading profits.\n\nThe headline grabbers, however, have been in tech, and especially big tech.\n\nThe big four, Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX), and Google (GOOGL), collectively known as the FANG stocks, have all reported EPS beats, ranging from a penny in the case of Netflix to a massive 168% upside surprise from Amazon. Now that we have all their earnings, it is time to take stock, if you’ll forgive the pun.\n\n\nDo you think these 5 stocks will continue to be good investments?", "id": "8myooc", "created_utc": 1527596794.0, "score": 166, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "Cool chart.

For instance, yes, Google makes the majority of its money off ads, but while Facbook does it with a single website, Google does it with several of its it's own websites (search, YouTube, Maps, Gmail, etc), plus its control of advertising on third party sites all over the internet.\n\nSimilarly, if you look at Amazon and Apple, Apple's sales are broken down by its 3 main products (iPhone, bigger iPhone aka iPad, and Mac), while all the multitude of things sold through Amazon's ecommerce platform fall under a single heading. That's like saying Walmart is no more diverse than the local shoe store because all the revenue from both come from selling retail products.\n\nRight now, I am long Alphabet and Apple. I think Apple is a strong short to medium term play. The stock buyback program should push it up, and it's current generation of overpriced phones is still selling well. They concern me long term because I don't think their share of the world's smartphone profits is sustainable, and they are not well diversified for a company as large and mature as they are. Don't forget that their growing service profits are predicated on the success of their ecosystem, ie. Its predicated on continued iPhone sales.\n\nI love Alphabet long term. They have one of the best moats around, in their main business, which is a huge money maker. But, the biggest growth catalyst is Waymo. They are the unquestioned leader in autonomous driving, and will have a dominant market position built up by the time anyone can even launch a competitor.

{"title": "5/28 Memorial Day Salute to the Soldiers Calls and Puts List", "selftext": "Saluting all our soldiers out there. God bless and hope you are 100% in Micron.\n\n**9:40 PM Update**\n\nPython was pulling stale equity prices from some random time, so I've re-ran everything and updated both tabs. All should be good **but double check prices and disregard the old info**\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qVwovvzBDdTT_VxBtHQC1WtwASRuHbJmCMYmAIXJL4U/edit?usp=sharing\n\nFAQs\n\n**What is this?**\n\nThis is a list of calls and puts that pass basic filters. Simplistically, it's looking for \"cheap\" options based on ask price. At first, the maximum price was $1 or less, but since volatility came back, it's been raised to $1.50. There are also basic volume, average daily trading volume for the underlying equity, and open interest screens it must pass.\n**\nWhat this list is not**\n\nThis is not a recommendation to buy any of these. This is a jumping off point, looking for lottery tickets (though many of them are better than that). Options are often all or nothing, so only risk what you are willing to lose 100% of (unlike say, equities). If you don't know what the hell any of these mean, stay away. This isn't Options 101 here.\n\nIf you want to learn more about options, go here for a starting point.\n\n**How should I use this?**\n\nThat's a lot to unpack but for a first time I'd stick to:\n\nCall options that need little movement (smallest %Change to ATM). Look though at how much is needed to be at the money and then how it's traded over the past year or so. A 5% move might not seem like much, but some stocks don't move that big over 3-4 months. Also see if the strike price is an all-time high or a rebound. I'd feel much more comfortable buying a strike that the stock has already reached before than one that would need to be 5-10% above the all-time high.\n\nStart small, and don't drop $5K on one. Most of these should be cheap-ish, so you should be able to buy 10-20 for <$1K and even that might be too big of a bet for your first (depending on how much you have).\n\nI also personally look for options that don't need to move a large amount just to make a good profit.\n\nhttp://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/\n\nThat's a good site to run your potential buy through to see what kind of return you'd make if it only moves a bit.\n\nIdeally I like to see 80-100% return somewhat early on, but that's also going to be a function of how cheap the option is (an option can go from $0.05 to $0.10 easier than $1 to $2).\n\nKeep it small, choose an option that only needs little relative movement and is far out. Usually you have to pay a premium for that, but if you scour the list enough you can find some good deals.\n\n", "id": "8muvzj", "created_utc": 1527554916.0, "score": 98, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 43, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for your service.\n\nAnd not for sacrificing your AMD calls so we can be free, but for serving.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Together we will show our tendies on Friday.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "What is dead may never die", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Chris I hope so.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Horseshoe on me, Big Sarge.
