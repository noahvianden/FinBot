{"title": "The Bullish Case for MU in Today's Volatile Stock Market", "selftext": "Disclaimer: This is a legit DD.\n\nFor those of you thinking that the overall slowing of iPhone production and comments from Tim Cook's boyfriend on the Apple call this week signal the beginning of cyclical trouble in DRAM pricing for Micron, **get fucked.**\n\nPer DRAMeXchange's market update report on 05/02:\n\n- Mobile DRAM prices expected to continue modest increase of ~2% over the next 6 months.\n- Smartphone production expected to INCREASE by 5-10% in 3QFY18 due to Chinese (Huawei, Xiaomi, etc...) production ramp-up. Keep in mind, $MU gets 51% of revenue from China.\n- Suppliers are offering products with more NAND Flash at lower prices which has lead to the 2018 NAND pricing declines, this we already know. HOWEVER, more flash memory requires pricier DRAM chips. These motherfuckers are savants.\n\nFor those who can read, the best fucking line of them all in the article -\n\n>DRAMeXchange notes that, although prices of DRAM products for PCs and servers continue to rise in the first half of 2018, large price fluctuations generally do not apply to mobile DRAM products... If the mobile DRAM suppliers increase the contract prices, less smartphone vendors will be willing to increase the memory density of their models.\n\nMoral of the story folks, Apple and their iPhones have never been the primary growth driver for Micron. Furthermore, they are not their primary smartphone customer. PC and Server DRAM prices are expected to continue to rise an additional 8-12% in 2018.\n\nDon't bet long-term against the cloud bois. **$MU easily holding in the $53-$56 range by late July.**", "id": "8gthu9", "created_utc": 1525379287.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 40, "comments": [{"body": "Somebody tell me why this guy is wrong or I'm going long", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "He’s wrong caz mu is blah blah cyclical and blah blah goes down on good news and blah blah pe 4.5", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "What about Cramer?
