{"title": "August/2018: Brand new $43k portfolio", "selftext": "Hey guys. I started investing in 2017 and have so far deposited $43k of principle into my account (pretty much my life savings). My account peaked at $53.5k on Jun 17, 2018. Ever since the trade war news broke out, my portfolio has been in a steady decline. I was also heavily invested in Facebook and Twitter during their last ER, they each dropped around 20% afterward. Also held Netflex throughout its month-long decline. Trying to recover my losses only made it worst. My portfolio is now back to where I started... So if you are given $43k of fund, how would you build a low risk, low gain but stable portfolio in today's ATH market?\n\nMy current garbage portfolio:\n\n$AMD 600,\n$TSLA 15,\n$TWTR 100,\n$FB 15,\n$AMZN 1,\n$NVDA 5,\n$APPN 75,\n$TWLO 70,\n$SHOP 50,\n$ALGN 5\n\nI never did any option tradings.\n\nThings I learned, might be wrong:\n- Don't buy before ER\n- Don't hold through ER\n- Don't sell at a loss to buy other stocks in hope to recover the losses\n- Portfolio requires active management, sell whenever there is a profit, even if it is small", "id": "974iol", "created_utc": 1534213088.0, "score": 6, "upvote_ratio": 0.6, "num_comments": 37, "comments": [{"body": "The lessons you learned are the wrong lessons.  \n\nIf you held through AMZN or MTCH earnings, you’d be fine.

A lot of your actions seem inherently contradictory to your goal of low risk, slow growth. I'm gunna break my advice down into 2 categories: picking stocks, and macro investing strategies. \n\nLets start with investing strategy: \n\n\\- Assuming that you are planning to have this money invested for 3-5-10 years (thinking long term), you need to start to train your self to buy and forget. You should rethink/rebalance your portfolio MAYBE once or twice a year but ideally, if you put in your work initially, you shouldnt have to do much tinkering. So, unless your trading, your conclusion that you shouldn't buy or hold through an ER seems pretty incorrect to me. \n\n\\- There is top down investing and bottom up investing (look it up if you don't know already). For top down strategies, ERs should be pretty irrelevant except for maybe when you are trying to find a good entry/exit point. For bottom up strategies, it could be more relevant, but even then you are going to have to hold your stock through an ER. \n\n\\- Sometimes selling your losers is the right thing to do. But, you shouldnt just sell because its losing, you should sell because you realize that you made a fundamental miscalculation or the market has somehow shifted (china trade shit showing up out of nowhere, for example). \n\n\\- If you are new to investing, I would recommend not taking a highly active hand with your portfolio. Most will agree that time in the market will yield returns...start with that and then once you become more experienced, slowly start to manage your positions a bit more. Generally tho, it sounds like you have been trading which is an entirely different ballgame. \n\nAs far as stocks go:\n\n\\- Personally (I have a very high risk appetite and im currently invested almost 100%in tech), I view Tesla as an extremely risky stock. I would nix it...especially now that there is some crazy talk of going private.\n\n\\- Twitter is a speculative growth stock to the max. Nix it also. Stocks like Netflix will also be relatively speculative and high growth but at least have a bit more to show for it. \n\n\\- IMO when it comes to tech, the real anchors are AMZN, microsoft, aapl, fb, google. Personally, I think those stocks have a lot of backbone compared to AMD, tesla, twitter. I also really like NVDA but im probably just blind and partial since I got lucky and bought at $55. \n\n\\- If I were in your shoes right now, I would take 10-15k of my portfolio and buy 1k of an s&p ETF every other week until it runs out. DCA is a powerful tool and I personally believe that a well balanced portfolio should have a healthy dose of  broad base index at its core. It might not be the next nflx but its a shit ton safer than Tesla.
