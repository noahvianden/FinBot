{"title": "Structural form of historic crashes and how to profit from a repeat", "selftext": "Building upon my previous post where I explained my reasoning for thinking we are within 2 months of seeing the market enter into a capitulation swing [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcgrqt/major\\_indices\\_could\\_drop\\_25\\_in\\_a\\_week\\_heres\\_when/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcgrqt/major_indices_could_drop_25_in_a_week_heres_when/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Structure of current and historic crashes \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLast post went through the structure of the MOEX crash. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aubqhr5zjcn81.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=16dd0368b11b5bb0d4a486654d8361adb8fa390b\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's look and see how this general structure has performed previously.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's DJI of 1929. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kvtmbdp3kcn81.png?width=1590&format=png&auto=webp&s=25e75795661dca5904bf170b0b1ef419c082dd95\n\nHere's Nikkei of 1989.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/luxxa9npkcn81.png?width=1592&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e9f914aee4c16e4e49119012a6534542c346b1e\n\nHere's the Nasdaq of 1999. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ism2zle3lcn81.png?width=1591&format=png&auto=webp&s=42ea769f9deac58a9dc081bc9fb188e3b58c3297\n\nSo the structure of the bear market in the MOEX has not be surprising, as per the rules of history. Like a post in here during 2021 said, \"[All crashes are similar only perceptions change](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/)\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Caveats \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHistory does not repeat but it rhymes.  These crashes are all similar to such an extend that they can provide useful models for trade plans. Assuming they will be entirely identical and only placing trades to profit from specifically that price move would not always work.  The market might make it easy, but it might not.  \n\nThe best tactic is to derive a general roadmap model from these crashes and work out the ideal points in which to make bets and how we'd know when these bets are not working and how to adjust our plans to look for a better trade later. Within our models we have some commonalities and some variables.  We can bet on the commonalities and protect against the variables. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Main Profit Points\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere in the Nasdaq example (Which was the hardest trade as per this model) the obvious point we'd have wanted to build up a short position is here. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a4yanlagmcn81.png?width=1588&format=png&auto=webp&s=7312295f42d37a5500a1b52a5a54a1acbe75ae6a\n\nIn the Nikkei it was here. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3czdv5g0ncn81.png?width=1595&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ef4d949bce5a0f7161b0807af9e8e6b95ec4ece\n\nIn  DJI it was here. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/50liyhu6ncn81.png?width=1584&format=png&auto=webp&s=113a27b6b28b4add1a7f926577828a7cf05e9a50\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point at which to start to build up aggressive shorts has always been pretty obvious, as per this model. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Variables \n\nTwo main variables are how high the market bounces from the 220 fib and then how long the capitulation part of the crash takes.  The main risk here is how big the bounce is. The drop not happening as fast as expected is less of a problem unless you make big YOLO bets. So maybe a problem here. But cautious wrinkly-balls like me should be fine. \n\nHow do we deal with the variable of not knowing how deep the bull trap will be and how long it will last? Simple ... We buy the support. Short puts into the support. Do things that mean we'll make money while the market is rising and this pays for the risk of shorting. We do not need to close our long positions. We can build up a short and if the market goes higher/takes longer - we break even. \n\nThis also protects us against the market rallying into ATH.  Assuming the market dumps to the 220 and we get good positions there, we can build up a bet that can not produce a net loss but can potentially make massive profits.  It's just about having a pro-active plan to deal with things not working out textbook perfect. Bet on the norms and protect against the variances. \n\nWhen structuring a position well, a bigger and slower bull trap is just a bigger and better opportunity.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# DJI's Big Areas \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMapping in our caveats, we may see a move something more like this than the shallower bull trap of the MOEX.  Marked in blue are areas to buy and marked in red are areas to short.  Areas to short get better from left to right.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/chkla9szpcn81.png?width=1591&format=png&auto=webp&s=b698a77235345701759fca7981b08d18140042d1\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Area 1**:  A duplication of the MOEX plan.  This is not the best value trade. It comes from lower and we have to speculate on a high being made off shallow retracement.  This is a move worth positioning for with protection (Long trades held). \n\n**Area 2**: A spike out the 127. High value entry spot. Better price and if we slowly build up a position in this area it can be very profitable.  Still worth holding the insurance trades long into here.\n\n**Area 3**:  Lowest value in terms of price but highest in terms of information value. By the time we were at this point we'd have a few things to help confirm we might be into a break. This is where I'd be a bit more liberal with my shorting. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/przxdolsocn81.png?width=1591&format=png&auto=webp&s=2348a439b3ab3ec617894b7c5e52b83adb289412\n\n# \n\n# Positions \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPositions are best taken in three ways with three different goals in mind. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Position 1**: Protection.  Shorting call spreads for above our expected high. If the market goes into a theta range these call spreads will save us from losing money.  \n\n**Position 2**: Profit.  ATM or slightly OTM puts with a reasonable amount of time on them.  Designed to profit so long as the market goes lower, even if it's not in the capitulation 1 week style. \n\n**Position 3**: Jackpots.  The mega deep and short-term OTM puts. Ones that can pay-out handsomely if we capitulate but as cheap enough to be covered by profitable short calls and/or ATM puts if no capitulation / slower decline.", "id": "tdxnr2", "created_utc": 1647264964.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 41, "comments": [{"body": "The difference between those crashes and now is that the top companies are printing shit loads of cash with continued strong growth.
