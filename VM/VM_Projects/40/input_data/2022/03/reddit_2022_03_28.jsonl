While I will not see that value in my hands unless the company goes bankrupt or the shareholders vote to liquidate (there's that voting thing), it is legally mine and the company obviously exists and makes goods and services that I can tangibly see.

{"title": "Homo Sovieticus", "selftext": "There have been 9 bear markets since 1950. That‚Äôs it. A bear market is defined by a general market decline of more than 20%. The average bear market lasts 289 days (about 10 months). We‚Äôve been falling for 4.5 months currently, but remember, that 289 day figure is AFTER we break 20% down.\n\nLook, I‚Äôm a degen, who‚Äôs been suspended on this sub longer than I‚Äôve been active on it, which is fine, because my lodestone is loved elsewhere, but my best case scenario for this market, is we reach capitulation by the end of Q1 2023. That capitulation will be a drawdown so severe it proffers generational buying opportunities, and absolutely savages the types here busy developing mega lottery strategies that aren‚Äôt biased short. The reason for this is *Homo Sovieticus,* who‚Äôs busy attacking Ukraine, which will cause all kinds of peripheral trouble and destabilization, datelined for a time later, which stocks will front run, wether Homo becomes Arch Duke of Ukraine or not.\n\nRemember the refugee crisis in Europe circa 2008-2015? The one that gave rise to Brexit and ushered in a new European political class? That was 5M people that invaded over a period of 7+ years. Ukraine will bring 2x-3x that in a fraction of the time.

Most there in the Middle East--just like Russian commoners--haven‚Äôt got a clue what‚Äôs coming, but they will after next season's harvests. Arab Spring 2.0 will see millions from Libya to Yemen move *el norte*, making these refugees more or less the pen that write Europe‚Äôs last chapter, a proud plot of land that had its time and place in history.\n\nThen there‚Äôs energy costs at large, which like in every bear market, signal a coming collapse in equity prices concluding with a lagging global recession. There‚Äôs the issue of lasers as well, the type required for semiconductors that use neon gas. Ukraine effectively controls the entire market for this neon gas. Supply chains will get rekt like the peak covid days. There‚Äôs inflation problems everywhere. There‚Äôs the likelihood China sells US Treasuries for Russian energy, or prints renminbi for it. Then there‚Äôs digital gold lurking in the background always putting more pressure on currencies as the trade for it becomes asymmetric.
