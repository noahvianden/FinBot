You will just have many different opinions/predictions based off political leanings, understanding of economics, past experience with recessions, etc. So form your own opinion on it and base it off all the impacting factors \n\n   Here is my semi idiotic opinion. We're in a recession we just haven't felt the full impact yet and I don't care what article claims otherwise. I do think they tried to change the definition to not panic people and both parties would do this. Why? You're just starting to see the layoff coming from large companies. \n \n  I think it will be worse than 2008. It is also different circumstances so we cant compare it too much to other economic crises. National debt is higher, businesses that survived and consumers are still recovering from the pandemic, and supply chains have been strained from covid still. The housing market is going to dive. The average consumer hasn't felt the cost of heating their homes yet as well another Fed hike coming Q4. Not taking a stance here on illegal immigration but that does come at a taxpayer cost and has increased tremendously. Crime is up which usually comes from an increase in poverty. \n  \n   You also have more world power global issues. Europe is struggling with energy and about to be in a recession (if not in one now). Europe last year accounted for 21% of global consumer purchases and with their cost to heat their homes as winter approaches I'd say they will be buying less and supplying less. The Russian Ukraine War and China's economy is also struggling. Global hunger levels rose by 46 million in 2021 after not increasing since 2015 which is also a sign of the world's economic state. \n  \n  So buckle up, clear your debt, and put some money aside for emergencies and investing in some cheap stocks.

You're confused by them doing the exact same thing they did in the 1970s and 1980s to fix inflation last time. High rates, corporate handouts. Back then the handouts took the form of deregulation and moving all the factories to China as well as cash money. The hands know what they're doing, they're just from a different planet than you.\n\nInflation last time was caused by a mix of doubling the workforce through women and minority rights in the 1960s and dropkicked by Nixon killing the gold standard - is one way to look at it, just as printing a shit ton of money after 2008 and giving the poors half a months rent twice in 2020 is the bogeyman this time. But inflation is only part about money supply, it's also an organic process that operates like a bank run.\n\nBoth in the 1960/70s (dilute labor by doubling it = inflation) and now (dilute cash by brrrrrrrrrrr) the crisis gets set off by restrictions in supply - 1970s oil crisis 2020 pandemic madness. Half of inflation then and now is about labor/dollar value but the other half is literally companies rushing the bank - raising prices because they fucking can.\n\nTLDR they need to make the people poor to disincentivize companies from raising prices because they fucking can while simultaneously handing out money to corpos to maintain something something American global hegemony.
