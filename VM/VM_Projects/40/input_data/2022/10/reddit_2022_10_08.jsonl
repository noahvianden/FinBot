{"title": "Thoughts on ZIM? What makes it such a great investment?", "selftext": "I’ve been talking about this for a lot but I think ZIM is very undervalued. Even though they have $12b assets $8b liabilities, they seen extremely undervalued compared to other shipping stocks like SBLK and DSX. The only question is why do they pay so high in dividends? They’re literally begging for the company to be bought out basically. It’s 100% a div trap because the shipping companies are “dying”, but ZIM still has very strong earnings. It’s market cap based on assets/liabilities alone should be greater than 3b, at least 4.5b, and that’s not even including future growth. Even though future growth is expected to decline by a whopping 80% in 2023, only bring a quarter EPS of $2 (compared to a whopping $14), that’s still a 50% yearly return based on current share price, and that’s not including future company projects. \n\nThe company itself has 4b short term liabilities and 4b long term liabilities. If dividends are cut to be 10-20%, the share price will obviously crash to an insanely low PE ratio with low long term assets, but the company still has $5b short term assets, but will have a nice cash reserve\n\nOverall, if the company gets bought out, it could be for as much as $70 a share. If consumer spending is better and zim succeeds in projects like buyouts, we could see $50-60. However, if ZIM goes as forecasted, based on other stocks earnings (like SBLK and DSX), $10 is not off the line, and for 2024-2025+, we could see big problems. SBLK and DSXs earnings are also expected to decline, albeit not as much as ZIM (40-50% YOY compared to 82%).

It's a completely different industry and can't be compared to containerships at all. What you should be doing is comparing ZIM to peers like DAC or GSL.\n\nWhat you'd find, if you did so, is that Zim operates asset-light, engaging in long term charters of other companies' ships, and operating on the spot market to profit on the difference. Obviously, the last two years were phenomenal for spot, and Zim made truck loads of cash. As spot rates come down, and the company enters into new, higher rate charters, profits close. Currently, there's nothing to imply a significant long term upside in spot rates that would lead Zim to huge margins.\n\nGSL and DAC, on the other hand, operate in the same market, but are the ones owning the ships, and have fixed rate, multi year charters for most of their ships. That means stable, secure cash flow, regardless of market conditions. In a wild market like 2020-2021, they lose some of the upside, but you can lock them in for profit over the next few years, even if the market crashes. Both companies, for instance, could let their ships be used to the end of their charters, immediately scrap them, close up shop, and be worth roughly 2x their current share value. ZIM, on the other hand, will face compressed margins for the foreseeable future, and does not have significant assets beyond cash. If they enter a negative earnings period (highly possible), they'll burn cash.\n\nSo basically, by buying Zim, you're betting on a surge in spot rates that nothing currently points to existing, in exchange for giving up guaranteed cash flow and value in more stable companies. Not saying that Zim is uninvestable, just pointing out the trade off.\n\nBut ultimately, please don't compare them to dry bulk or tankerships.", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Oh shit you’re right. I apologize for that. I just compared them based on occupation. GSL and DAC are consistent but ZIM is just leverage.

The only problem is that the short term debt is unsustainable, and that of course they can get rid of it immediately, but that would leave them with high long term debt ratios and lower stock prices with no earnings potential. It’s a very very very risky play, and stocks like DAC and GSL do not have short term debt issue. Both of those stocks are expected to decline in earnings, but not by a long shot, and if consumer confidence increases, we will see all the stocks that you and I mentioned go up by a large amount.

{"title": "10/8/22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Weekly Market Analysis", "selftext": "Well I took the day off today and missed an absolutely banger of a day it looks like. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7n3vm2r8mls91.png?width=502&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f3168133d679793971b83d9f5b4953b9e9408ec\n\nLets start with the “why” SPY fell 2.79% Friday and then lets talk about it a little bit more. Last week well really Monday we saw a massive media pivot (punny haha) where all of a sudden they went from the doom and gloom to “most likely the fed will pause rate hikes after this November meeting.” It was kind of a really odd change of pace for the media as anyone with more then 2 brain cells pretty much understands that the fed is already way behind on these rate hikes and that the biggest mistake the fed could make right now is decreasing their rate hikes too fast or too soon. Que the Volker era mistakes. JPOW himself has been pretty clear that he is not going to stop rate hikes until 2024 most likely. \n\nSo lets talk about Friday… we finally had a data drop that was “big” enough to effect the markets. We have been having jobless claims like usually and the last one actually showed a slight increase in jobless claims but unemployment decreased. Good for America right? Well no the FED is going to continue to be aggressive and increase rate hikes until inflation is down and pretty much till the economy takes a big hit. Without saying it the ideal unemployment rates near 8-10% for them. With a STRONG work force and STRONG economy Feds have a lot more room to be hawkish. \n\nThis explains to me why we had a red open, however, it seems liked a bit of a over reaction in my opinion. But that brings me to my next “why” did Friday close so red. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dfdraz49mls91.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a2233d9273791bd6c640388732f5320169b03c3\n\nLast Tuesday I mentioned the “phantom print” that hit the tapes. Now there is a lot of speculation about what these prints mean or why they are happening. Well we finally came down and touched 366.57 today. Only took 3 days this time, however, the last few times these prints have hit the day of or the next day the phantom print has been hit. \n\nWell lets fast forward to Friday and take a look at our range. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e5or73k9mls91.png?width=741&format=png&auto=webp&s=9cd3d3b933679a3233063dae2b2d1a18c30c8753\n\nThere it is… yet another phantom print hitting the tapes and effecting the daily range. Fridays TRUE high of day was 369.37 while the brokers are showing 373.29 as are true range. Why are these phantom prints such a big deal? Well from a logistical stand point it shows that the darkpool orders are really active behind the scenes right now. Someone is doing some massive buy and sells behind closed doors and are literally moving the markets with them. On the other hand from a technical stand point these phantom prints make the daily candles look completely different then what they are supposed to look like and effect patterns and algos and everything else. \n\nSo where are we at not? Whats next for SPY? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c78dc79amls91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8168bbafbf70e043eeee74b5d1c0da400846378b\n\nI mentioned Thursday it looked like we were repeating the June tight consolidation before a major breakdown but now it appears we are repeating the June 21st to July 29th range trading of 372.5 to 390.2, however, this time our range is 362.8 to 378.3. As you can see even with the big dump today we bounced pretty aggressively off 360.94 and closed right at that key 362.79 support level. \n\nNow this is where the phantom print really messes with stuff… On one hand we have this massive $12.35 phantom candle when in reality its closed to a $8 candle range. With the phantom candle we have a wick over the daily 8ema, however, with the true candle we would have just closed a candle below the daily 8ema completely. The other thing is using the phantom candle we have the less aggressive black falling wedge with a resistance of 368.3 for Monday, however, the true candle uses that red dotted falling wedge which gives a resistance of 361.3 for Monday. They tell very different stories. \n\nThe biggest story I am seeing and ill look to see how it plays out this week is that 362.8 to 378.3 range. Again as I said last week there are vey few reasons to go long here until after CPI on Thursday. Once that data drops good or bad we should have a pretty good sense of where we are headed for the next month. \n\nThe more I look at SPY the more I see we actually are forming another massive diamond breakout pattern. Key diamond support for Monday is 361.9 and diamond resistance is 376.4. I will be watching this pattern closely next week for a hint of where we should see the next few weeks of trading take us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ydqs0yamls91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=3da653b35c9173b7b12a10f62d1f4c22efb94602\n\nTaking a look at the weekly chart this is where I become more bearish then bullish. We after putting in one hell of a good fight to trade over the weekly 200ema for most of the week got wrecked on Friday and that led us to close back below the weekly 200ema. With this massively long wicked gravestone doji on a down trend I would expect further downside. Usually a gravestone doji on a down trend would lead to further downside instead of more upside. However, with a FOMC minutes Wednesday and CPI Thursday (look for the trade analysis of this in the server later today or tomorrow) we are going to see another week where the technical don’t matter. \n\nSPY is maintaining the highly aggressive black bear channel down and now also has an even more aggressive red dotted resistance line too. With a nice weekly 8ema breakout rejection. A lot of the signs of this weekly point to bearish. \n\nThere is hints of a small V bottom forming as you can see but I am unsure if that plays out or not this week. The biggest thing I am seeing in the event of bad news from FOMC and CPI is that we could see a support bounce near 338 this week. This is the support form the covid crash. Spy would essentially be erasing 2 years of movement up if we retrace to that level. \n\nKey support- 362.1 (weekly v bottom) -> 357 -> 350.4 -> 338 -> 331.8\n\nKey resistance- 366.6 -> 369.1 (red dotted resistance) -> 376.4 (black bear channel resistance) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eo7vz8ibmls91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=686c36bd842a3e333a9b396bd342b21247e466ea\n\nFutures (I cleaned chart so you can see it better) has the same diamond pattern forming too. Key support for Monday is 3650 and key resistance is 3780. We are seeing the same similar pattern here on Futures where we are set in a bigger consolidation range of 3650 to 3805. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8lranybmls91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a3d6f58ee81db287b3869caa13384f177778b3d\n\nFutures weekly looks similar but has a much bigger bodied gravestone doji. It almost looks like a hammer candle which could result in a reversal but with a small wick to the downside its classified as a doji. With that massive weekly 8ema rejection and red dotted resistance falling wedge inside the bear channel it does appear set up for further downside this week. \n\nNote we failed just barely to touch the jpm collar of 3870 and will look at the first set of puts at 3425 if we break down. \n\nKey support- 3590 -> 3530 -> 3470 -> 3415 (black bear channel support) -> 3395 (green bear channel support)\n\nKey resistance- 3705 (red dotted resistance falling wedge) -> 3855 (black bear channel) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1nd5o0gcmls91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f03641ca2fc6945e46b9fda55381a1f7feaf5be\n\nHighlighted in blue this time we once again have another diamond pattern formed on Apple. This times its quite a wide diamond pattern as opposed to the last one we saw back around the beginning to middle of September. Remember when that support broke on the diamond we saw the big downside push we have now play out. \n\nThe only regret I have trading this week is not holding my apple puts. I was 100% correct in expecting that the 146.5 triple top with gravestone doji rejection of the blue bear channel resistance and closing back under the daily 8ema would lead to further downside. However, I closed my puts for breakeven because I knew I wouldn’t be trading yesterday (Friday) and would be able to manage the position. In the end no dollars lost so its find but I do wish I would have held those. \n\nAnyways that played out and now we are seeing the diamond pattern and this massive resistance line play out. Apple is set up for a decently green Monday unless bears come out swinging on Monday. Unless apple opens below 138.8 (-1%) and holds that all day we will see that black resistance line (through the diamond) broken to the upside which should lead to a much back to test 142.4 and possibly 144.1. Apple now has a gap to fill all the way up to 147.54 which I do expect to be in play early next week. \n\nKey support will be that blue diamond support at 140 and resistance at 145.9.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qjpswxbdmls91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=21ac2335bd208f3e2ce4d732ad645d24de36f5f8\n\nApples weekly is actually one of the more bullish charts I have seen out here. Especially before Fridays massive dump Apple was putting in a really tight double bottom with a massive push up. However, the way this candle finished as a weekly 8ema rejection with a double bottom at 138.1 with a gravestone doji. Again very similar to a long bodied hammer candle which as a double bottom would lead to a huge push up, however, the gravestone doji becomes the wild card. \n\nLooking at the last month on Apple we are seeing quite the bit of dejavu honestly. Apple does look poised for an early week bounce. \n\nKey support- 138.2 -> 133.4 -> 129.1\n\nKey resistance- 141.7 -> 145.5 (blue bear channel resistance) -> 149.3\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d19wd6zdmls91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c7d553d94805ccb44ca65344426453541702f9ff\n\nTesla is the stock that just cant seem to catch a break. Every time it looks like it could bounce or could see a small push up it catches a bad break from the market. Earlier in the week when SPY and the rest of the market went on a massive run Tesla got stomped because of the delivery numbers and then it also got stomped because of the twitter deal. Now we are seeing the inverse head and shoulders pattern hopefully played out. I do believe that Tesla is due (way overdue) for a bounce but there is a chance it continues to drill a little lower before we find that support. \n\nTesla is impressively red 6 of the last 7 days now and in the last 3 weeks has fallen a total of 29.3% in 3 weeks. Tesla is also now only 6.9% off of its 52 week low. My thoughts on tesla is that IF CPI comes in good tesla is finally going to put the boosters on and will be the best call position. However, if CPI is bad I think tesla will easily break into the 100s and will be a great short position. \n\nI am still looking for a small recovery bounce on Tesla early this week. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l3b768pemls91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=21d7deb1a3f50385c778a44a28a2deea35d77809\n\nWeekly timeframe wise we are seeing that the June recovery support line has finally been broken… remember this is the support line that many stocks (Spy and apple included) broke over a month ago. The toughest part of Tesla right here is that on one hand its down 30% in 3 weeks and it seems like FOMO chasing more puts on it… however, it clearly has not bounced and does not appear to want to bounce even when given every opportunity to bounce. \n\nThe biggest bullish case I am seeing formed on Tesla right now is that it is forming a potential 222 double bottom off previous support. If Monday holds this 222 level there is a pretty good play on calls (especially if SPY and Apple start to bounce green). However, if we lose that 222 level I am looking for a bigger retrace to 207 and possibly all the way down to 178. The weekly 200ema which has not been touched since October 2019 sits at 186.3. \n\nKey support- 222 -> 207 -> 186.3\n\nKey resistance- 238.9 (blue resistance) -> 255\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vld75safmls91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff4e9e2f8f630daf46ae97d9d5cfcad60fae65b9\n\nOverall the VIX is still in a pretty clear upward channel right now. The vix remains stuck over 28.4 however is failing to break through and hold over 33. The one thing I am seeing is that this looked like a nice revert to mean move up on the VIX back to is previous 6 days trading period average of 31.6. \n\nWith FOMC minutes and CPI next week I do wonder if they will attempt to artificially unwind the vix some next week. Having the VIX near 32 before FOMC minutes and CPI is a disaster waiting to happen and very well COULD result in the VIX breaking 40+ and full on capitulation that we all have been waiting for and the markets have “feared.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lx4ndeyfmls91.png?width=855&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc9a7353257fc277100a421915f4c11aaadd2a61\n\nFed and Data wise this week we have one hell of a week ahead… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w3uhmedgmls91.png?width=908&format=png&auto=webp&s=4bf4ab52102cd56fd13f8b90c27ffd4df8751b59\n\nI will talk about this more detailed in my CPI write up and FOMC write up but I think we are setting up for a choppy to green early beginning of the week with a pretty massive break down Wednesday to Friday. \n\nI will be looking at for a pretty big CPI miss this time. CORE forecast is already set to be 0.2 to 0.1% higher then previous (with their consensus/ forecast being 0.2% +/-) so we really could be looking at anywhere from 6.3% (no change aka bearish) to 6.7% (big miss real bearish) and actual CPI while it has now come down 2 CPI in a row the consensus and forecast is HIGHER then the previous (with the same 0.2% +/-) we can expect a CPI of 7.8% to 8.3%. Note we have had as much as 0.3% of a difference in consensus and actual. So we could be seeing 7.7% to 8.4%.\n\nIf CPI comes in a 7.7-7.8% BUT core once again misses markets are gonna dump hard due to KNOWING fed can no pivot, however, if CPI comes in higher and CORE drops markets are likely to dump either way. The ONLY way I see markets rallying on Thursdays CPI numbers is if the CORE and CPI both drop… that would mean by some miracle the consensus of CPI and CORE CPI were incorrect. In my opinion odds of a big green CPI Thursday are low. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall this was an amazing week for me. I had a big benefit from playing some overnight swings (longer DTE) and picking the correction direction. I didn’t trade Friday due to family stuff but overall turned in an amazing week. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j4e3tgxgmls91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc531d80519b8cf38c20b67293513f0692f53bcc\n\nLook forward to seeing you guys next week!

{"title": "Gather around apes. A 1 month ban bet on the September CPI announcement!", "selftext": "**TL;DR** I have challenged u/ErectoPeentrounus on his 7-7.5% CPI prediction, with my own prediction of 8.15-8.25%. His post can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xtuyoh/the\\_freezing\\_cold\\_cpi\\_a\\_bulls\\_saving\\_grace/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xtuyoh/the_freezing_cold_cpi_a_bulls_saving_grace/)\n\nWe have agreed on a 1 month ban bet which closes at CPI announcement. To the mod u/opinion_is_unpopular can you please record this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Background** \n\nI've built a Machine Learning model that predicted 8.26-8.56% at last reading, which is pretty  accurate. Especially considering that this interval is based on two separate predictions. In essence, I've ran 5 different models, and my two best estimates were 8.26% and 8.56% the first judged by out of sample accuracy, and the second being the best performing in sample.\n\nAs a proof of my prediction prior to the announcement, I have the following two comments:\n\n1.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xcoply/comment/io87ysy/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xcoply/comment/io87ysy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n2.

While the BRNN had the best in sample performance, it was the worst performing model out of sample. It most likely suffers form overfitting, which I couldn't fix. However, I trust (almost) everything with the prefix Bayesian, so I didn't want to discard it in my last prediction.\n\n[The difference between the predicted CPI and actual CPI - A horizontal line is desirable.](https://preview.redd.it/bhv0krgwjms91.png?width=5512&format=png&auto=webp&s=76041dd2758d3febe193790bbd194e07f8395ff3)\n\nHowever, I came to trust the GBM - and its prediction is 8.17% for the upcoming CPI. The idea is **not** to estimate the actual inflation, but what the BLS is going to announce which falls in line with the model.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The RMSE of each model.

But it is, in the end, them who dictate what Inflation is.\n\nHave patience, it will all be open-source once its verfied. Because f*** wallstreet.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "But BLS’s model is based on CPI basket and inflation of various baskets across sectors. I am not sure I follow your logic.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "This is true. However, you could, also, calculate Inflation using, for example, Nominal GDP (Aka GDP Deflator, iirc) - or use a different basket you find more representative of spending. Each of these methods are to some degree equally valid.\n\nThere is at the moment a really awesome tool called Truflation which measures Inflation daily based on live data, however their Inflation numbers are higher than BLS. Which should you believe? It depends. The most important thing is who the market responds to - and that is BLS! \n\nNow you could go ahead and create a basket of proxies and then hoping to emulate the BLS estimate, or you could run a machine learning model on the BLS estimate to do an educated guess of what this estimate will be!\n\nIt worked last month for me, time will tell wether this is the case this month. The essence is that Inflation is an estimate of price increases, not the actual increase.\n\nDoes it make sense?

However, the movement is not important in itself - as this isnt what drives volatility and spikes at announcement time of CPI. Its the market expectations amongst others primarily.\n\nYou only have to have a more accurate estimate than the rest, and most importantly what the market expects. In essence that marginal difference determines who has the edge ar CPI announcement!\n\nBut otherwise I agree. All decent models of Inflation converges in theory! 😊\n\nEdit: We all knew Inflation was dropping last month. Markets expected 8.1, my model 8.25-8.53. \n\nNow a difference of 0.15-0.43 isnt much. Its 4.3$ to a 1000$ purchase, hardly of any economic significance.

I have edited my original post while you were replying.

It assumes, firstly, that the way BLS estimates Inflation is the same.\n\nSecondly, it assumes that, on average, the economic environment is constant. If, say, prices sky rocket 10000% one month, and falls by 10000% the next the model needs time to recalibrate and are useless for months.\n\nThe second assumption is not an explicit assumption that I have imposed, but is natural consequence of this kind of modelling approach. However, looking back at the 9.1% inflation the model still fares well. However, we are now moving into a turf that needs testing and time to see wether it is actually the case that this assumption is even made if you catch my meaning.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Ok, thanks for the response. I appreciate your statistical modelling approach to this but when inflation is subjected to such inflation volatility, i wasnt able to wrap my head around how your model can act as an accurate precursor. It’s great once the consumers have found footing and has a general trend of which way to look, but the actuals vs target vs relative indice trading price is no more than coin flip. You can try to get an edge by looking at various indicators like futures, immigration & customs, rental housing data, etc. for hints at sept CPI, but it’s difficult to rely on models like yours when it doesnt incorporate any of these indicators. Not to disparage what you’ve built so far, but fundamentally speaking, it think it may require some more fine tuning IMO.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I agree on this.
