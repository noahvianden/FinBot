And the probability for him to lose is barely 1%. Today it’s his third trade that rolled to FEB 40-80 strike. The only requirement for such trade: you need a ton of buying power sitting in the account to avoid margin call, but it’s almost 100% free ticket to the VIX lottery.\n\nThe whale consistently buying low strike call and sell high strike call on same expiration about 4 months out, while having a ratio of 1:4. It’s a credit trade, 4x short leg higher strike cost>1xleg lower leg long, therefore the entire spread is free of charge, with a collateral requirement initially. Then the trade will decay with short legs faster than long leg supercharged with 4 times more contracts. If vix spikes, as long as it’s not an overnight spike to 80-100, he will always make money since the short leg decays so much faster and long leg decays little, he closes out by selling the less decayed long leg while buying back the hugely decayed short leg. Only problem is if vix moves crazy before 50% of expiry he needs a 50-200% additional collateral in buying power to avoid margin call. The source is my own research, and everything is exactly simulated on thinkorswim risk profile. 1% probability is based upon trade start date’s vix volatility and spot price. The higher short leg= near 2 sigma+ standard deviation equates about 1% chance of short leg in the money but he will always have the choice to exit or roll before shit hits the fan. \n\nNote never plays calendar spreads on vix due to different expiration correlate to different futures contract, not spot vix.\n\nNote 2: his best scenario p/l would be near 50-100% if his initial collateral/margin required, but the key point here is that this is a FREE trade, if you are wrong you are still compensated premiums.\n\nNote 3: his contract size usually around 37500 vs 150000.

As many people are pointing out here the biggest risk for this whale is if the vix spikes and he/she will blow up the account. you also pointed out this whale probably have 100-150M to use as margin, but in the whale's case he/she might not need to use the margin at all, like ever.\n\nWhat I do find interesting is the historical data. since the introduction of vix in early 90s, the highest Vix ever got to was 89.53 intra day on oct, 24th,Friday  2008. (that day the vix closed at 79 btw.)\n\nother than that vix did closed above 80 for 3 days in total. \n\nMarch 16th , 2020 monday at 82.69\n\nOctober 27th 2008 monday at 80.06\n\nNovember 20th 2007 thursday at 80.86\n\nFirst thing that cross my mind is none of those days are a Wednesday. So even if the whale held on to last minute until the 40/80 ratio spread expires, it will expire worthless and the whale will still pocket the premium from short legs.\n\nnow even if those days were on a Wednesday, because the long leg is so deep ITM and short legs were barely ITM, the ratio spread will still expire with premium, as matter of fact it will be much more profitable for this whale when vix expire right above 80 than when vix expire around say 20-30.\n\nI did put vix at 150 and ran the quick math, when vix hit 150 this position will be somewhere -600M underwater, that 150M margin account aint gonna do shit. However, I would again like to point out Vix never exceed 90 in the 7000+ trading days since it existed.\n\nso even if this whale is a bot as long as it sticks with the  40/80 spread it will literally has never lost money yet. I can understand why the system calculate the probability of losing is 1%.\n\nI did run the math by hand instead of an option calculator or on ToW, and data are from yahoo finance. Feel free to point out any errors and I just didnt want to post two pages of simple P/L calculation.\n\nthe biggest downside of this is the ratio spread doesnt limit much of the downside unlike a vertical spread. with a tight vertical spread its usually a 1:2 win/loss ratio. with this 40/80 strike price 1:4 ration spread it's like 1:100+ win/loss ratio but with extremely high win probability. (probably the highest ever???).

People gets a bit too crazy when talking about risks but actually I think it’s not that unmanageable otherwise structured products wouldn’t have been the biggest hit in Asia country that’s been suppressing vol ever since “abenomics”.

So this spread actually give you relative low yield and it does take up come capital/margin.  \n\nI whole hearted believe this is actually a hedge, but a pretty damn good one. plug in the numbers when Vix goes above 40. 40 call will be in the money but still worth more than the 80 short calls.
