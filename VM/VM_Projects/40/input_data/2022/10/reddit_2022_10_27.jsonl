{"title": "10-27-22 SPY/ ES futures, Apple and Tesla Daily TA", "selftext": "It was the best of times… it was the worst of times… We finally saw SPY break the 7 day trend of rip at open and we finally got a nice sell off. Which turned into a beyond choppy and untradeable day. I wasn’t able to really trade a lot today as I had to learn before 10am to go pick my kid up who had a fever and was puking and was in and out most of the day with her being home sick. \n\nAfter hours is looking brutal on SPY right now sitting down -1.2%. Havent seen that level of drop after hours in a long time!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tlwurltjwew91.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1a8df516ea9b2038bead1f56722f6177fa327ff\n\nAmazon as expected… and honestly I have the same feelings towards Bezos as I do ZUCK…. But red red red… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ddhdh68kwew91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=62188750e7aa3a75bb2bd78cc42078585c755245\n\nHighlighted this yesterday on futures but im highlighting it today on SPY to make it even more clear. The blue arrows show what looks like a possible top on SPY which should lead to a sell off. I will be looking for an interaction with SPY at 378 support (now resistance after hours). This is the key level that separates the green and grey channels. A breakdown under this support and back into the green channel would signal to me a retest of 360s is coming before we reach 390 resistance. \n\nThis will be the key pivot level to watch tomorrow. If we reject there in the morning or close back below that support of 378 (at this point we do have a gap to fill) then I will be looking for a further sell off next week leading into FOMC and with FOMC. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/siz07crkwew91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e192f0dd3fbbc96eb2a878a0d727f14768d0d3f3\n\nI will touch on this more tomorrow in the weekly TA but overall SPY, Futures and Apple weekly charts are setting up for a massive failed breakout gravestone doji which should lead to a pretty nice sell off next week. The one caveat with this is that FOMC is next week and that can be a wild card for sure. If it wasn’t for FOMC id play puts for sure but I will sit cash most likely unless something looks really good. \n\nKey support- 378.8 -> 378 -> 374.3 -> 370.5\n\nKey resistance- 380 -> 383.1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r9wsuk9lwew91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a43420d3fdce710ecceeadf5f5719263aaf0994b\n\nIf you read last nights TA I said that futes most likely would go up and touch 3870 before it rejected just like happened back first week of October. That would then lead to a sell off and we would see a further sell off intraday. Well with this drop after hours its setting up perfectly to see the next leg down leading into FOMC next week. \n\nWith that 3870 rejection and now sitting back under key 3805 support I would look for the 3600s before I look for 3900 again. \n\nKey support -3770 -> 3705 -> 3675\n\nKey resistance- 3805 -> 3840\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9720pjolwew91.png?width=820&format=png&auto=webp&s=696e8fd6e1e3a975282526d8f34a42f8822e652a\n\nWell there it is… Apple missed on pretty much everything but china rev lol. So that’s not very good.. currently only down 4% after hours though. The golden boy lives! The call will be interesting for sure especially since they never give guidance anyways. \n\nEdit- apple BEAT on everything but china... that is fully my bad and i just can't read. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9n35cd5mwew91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e171c1eab560f8534a0aa34ac509f9c7cce148e7\n\nTo be honest though earnings is a whole none issue for me. Apple today broke through key red bull channel support. This is the same channel that SPY and Futures are holding so far. I will look regardless of what happens for further downside next week. This could be the fuel that markets need to see Apple retest its 52week low finally. If and when that happens I will believe that the temporary bottom is in. \n\nKey support- 144.7 -> 142.8 -> 141.1\n\nKey resistance- 148\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/djwzdynmwew91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c33f48f1cf372e8f99b2921f1082046198b08e9\n\nAnd then there was tesla! So this is one that I am actually most excited about tomorrow at open. I think Tesla is poised for a really nice sell off tomorrow and next week. Tesla went on pretty much a 4 day bounce rally this week and established a super impressive rising wedge and bull channel. However, we say today that we broke out at open touching and rejecting key 234 resistance and then it dumped from there. If you caught that move it was one heck of nice win (granted not as nice as the call win yesterday). With this rising wedge broken I am looking to short tesla at open tomorrow most likely. I think if market remains are red as it is right now and Apple drops tomorrow and the rest of tech including SPY finally then we will see Tesla test that bull channel support. \n\nTesla has established a really nice 230 to 205 consolidation channel. I am using the 230 area as a nice opportunity for puts and the 205 area for a nice opportunity for calls. \n\nSupport- 219.2 -> 215.6\n\nResistance- 225 -> 230 -> 234\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dd2d6vwnwew91.png?width=618&format=png&auto=webp&s=777ad628dae0705e6b42b5e589df7b105c2f728d\n\nBesides the VIX being detached from reality the one thing I am looking at is that we bounced off that previous support of 27 today and closed with a dragonfly doji. This should result in a nice retracement tomorrow which should also result in a nice dump of SPY tomorrow. \n\n10% challenge- \n\nWell after an all around fucky day… just found out my daughter who I had to go pick up this morning during opening hours actually has the VID… my son who I picked up from school at normal time walked out with an ice pack on his head cause he fell off the swing and probs has a concussion… our household be falling apart I tell ya. \n\nBut I played Meta overnight for a decent win… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r3a3g0eowew91.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=756a883529e05d2d236cc5d12a0d880740637607\n\nIntraday today didn’t get to play much. I ended up closing my level to level spy play EOD during PH cause I was supposed to leave to take my kid to the doctor… had I held that 1.6% win it would had hit 80% profits during that 15 minute drop after hours… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jvsylnvowew91.png?width=769&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4f2681fe29bb597eca9e33a7e44be83f75dbd59\n\nOverall good day.
