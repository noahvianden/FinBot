{"title": "The Bull Case for Oil", "selftext": "*TLDR: supply is very constrained, and getting worse. Producers are investing less, and are motivated to produce less. Demand/consumption is growing linear with the population growth rate. Oil prices go up when supply is down and demand is up. Oil stocks make a lot of profit, pay nice dividends, and appreciate in value when the price of oil is high.* \n\nHere is a series of graphs which will explain the bull case for oil. \n\n# Less Production\n\nAll the major producers of the world, are producing less. Scarcity drives demand and increases prices, if you produce something to sell it you want to sell it at a high price - high enough to make it worthwhile to produce. If the price not high enough, you don't produce. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Oil production trending down](https://preview.redd.it/ec6fkaiubxq91.png?width=1114&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f137547656faccec61c2cf35e7b8cdab70b6cc8)\n\n# Oil is Bad Narrative \n\nThe politicians, left-wing, environmentalists, social justice warriors, ESG supporters, have labeled the \"oil industry\" as the evil villain of capitalism. The theme of the green movement is \"we will be completely off of fossil fuels by \\[insert arbitrary date here\\] and replace it with renewable energy.\" That means that the agreed upon plan for global society as a whole is to stop consuming this commodity in the next 15 years or so. \n\nIf you were an oil company, would you be motivated to invest in infrastructure to go get more of that commodity? If your capital expenditure projects take 10 years to come online and break even, would you want to be starting new projects? No. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k1ue1s9wbxq91.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9e5e126bcdff7b142351e12a345ae2477dd545c\n\n# Less Ocean Rigs\n\nThe US has less oil rigs than it did pre-pandemic, and even the rig count recovery has plateaued and started to decline. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aao9e9w1cxq91.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=fdb919985ca23d758bc8c895a7404dc24c9039ed\n\n# Strategic Reserves Depleting Fast \n\nRussia invasion, and the west not buying Russian oil, has led to global oil storage to reach record lows. Biden already unloaded the strategic petroleum reserve in order to lower gas prices before the midterms. That has to be refilled eventually. \n\nThis explains the recent surge in supply, and the decrease in price. Eventually this comes back in the other direction with an increase in demand (refilling the SPR) and an increase in price. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/85612x13cxq91.png?width=623&format=png&auto=webp&s=04fb43ced8a754b1e392aefbf29ba1b149f81f45\n\n# Easy to Access Shale Sweet Spots are Gone\n\nAll of the majority of US oil products comes from shale. This is/was the \"shale revolution\" which actually is showing signs of not meeting demand expectations - and the easy to get oil is running out. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3zp3wp87cxq91.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c1ffcd85af8a1d67b67805a5dc980b59e2e6dfa\n\n# Produce More Slowly is the Answer\n\nThe easy to get oil is running out. The answer is to \"boost production more slowly.\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r70ld9aqcxq91.png?width=693&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a33c06bab91f106a5bbee185ed39df22e81d2d3\n\n# Refineries are at Capacity \n\nOil isn't only about production, it has to be refined. The US has the best refineries in the world and makes \"dirty\" oil products into the finished goods like gasoline. Our capacity to distill is in decline and isn't significantly higher than it was in the 1990s. There is currently less than 2% of available capacity, which means we are running the refineries day/night 365 producing 98% of what is humanly possible. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ixsg66iycxq91.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=929ae1d9cbb1adaaf5447c2b6abbd8a496d0708f\n\n# No One is Investing in Infrastructure \n\nGlobal spending on oil investments has been declining for many years. Why would you invest in something society is trying to get rid of? You wouldn't. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bxdg6r9ifxq91.png?width=1259&format=png&auto=webp&s=20dcb63c61a213cda2dc1ecabf8ccf6cd1d825b4\n\n# China Will Reopen \n\nChina remains on lockdown because they are too dumb/proud to use the superior vaccines supplied by the west. One day this will stop and China will come back online with a surging demand for oil - just like the rest of the world did when they ended lockdowns. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jl46fogudxq91.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=58146116a00a9e16225377c41e2cf7ee52e4a122\n\n# Two Oil Markets, Russian Supply is Gone \n\nThere are now two oil markets:\n\n* Countries willing to buy from Russia (china, india, some other emerging markets)\n* Everyone else who buys oil from anyone other than Russia. \n\nRussian oil hasn't really left the supply side, but it has when considering the \"western\" consumption of oil. From the west's perspective, it has the same demand, but far less supply. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6d0aww9eexq91.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=04c447c0f6fdf1e92d936e4cf8b7a7450ffadf8e\n\n# Nord Stream Leak\n\nRussia, or someone, sabotaged the Nord Stream One pipeline. This decreases supply and adds capital expenditure costs that didn't need to happen - both of which drive oil price up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a7fc1n4mexq91.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae949653cdcb0d2253d28ba94bba1d1bf6ebffee\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Demand is Outpacing Supply \n\nOil supply used to keep up with consumption, but the pandemic and \"the left\" have made the supply side of oil very constrained. Producers produced less because of the pandemic, shut down oil rigs, stopped drilling new sites - and the political climate makes it increasingly difficult to resume. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jrfcmlkcfxq91.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8231db61ab5631525bdde1766a3965609f66e393\n\n# OPEC Producing Less\n\nEven OPEC is producing less today than they were in 2015. OPEC wants profit for the member nations. Remember, they have plenty of their own oil and it is essentially \"free\" to them so they want the prices as high as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fbj9w2jsfxq91.png?width=609&format=png&auto=webp&s=89473360b989bc5986073163abcf4cb45c43d509\n\n# But the Recession! \n\nYes, recessions lead to a decrease in demand. Yes, there is demand destruction if people don't want to fill their cars with gas or take plane flights because of the cost. Yes, demand may decline over the next year or so. This is insignificant in comparison to the decrease in supply, and is only a temporary event. Global oil consumption, and population growth, is a long term smooth up trend - a recession is a temporarily event - which is followed by an increase in growth and demand. \n\n# Think of it like a bar, with prohibition coming soon. \n\nIf you owned a bar and you had alcoholic customers, and a bar full of half full bottles of liquor, and you knew that prohibition was going into effect in the coming weeks, and buying new alcohol was impossible, how would you behave? A rational human would horde the remaining supply of alcohol and slowly sell it while you still could at inflated prices. You would want to maximize profits while you still could. If you control the thing your customers are addicted to, and the supply of that thing is running out, and you know you can't/won't produce more of the thing, the price is going up. \n\n# Conclusions:\n\nOil supply is constrained for many years to come.   \nOil demand is constant and grows with the population. \n\nTo make the transition to \"green energy\" it requires a significant period of oil consumption. You can't make batteries, or electric planes, or ship containers, or make plastic, or heat homes with wind/solar/nuclear. We can only build the infrastructure to replace oil, by consuming oil.  \n\nThe world is addicted to oil, at least for the next 15-20 years. The producers of oil know this and are deliberately producing less, investing less, and riding the price of oil up until its final crescendo.\n\nLong: DVN, FANG, LNG, BTU, EE, XLE, CVX, VOC, OXY, CLF, CTRA, NUE, FLNG, PBI, ET", "id": "xrtkjs", "created_utc": 1664516966.0, "score": 17, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 51, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|2 years ago\n**Total Comments**|74|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xrtkjs/the_bull_case_for_oil/) \n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=xrtkjs)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=xrtkjs)\n    \nHey /u/mytendies, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "it is DD", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Isn‚Äôt the nord stream pipeline for natural gas?
