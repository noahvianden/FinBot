Its like they are asleep at the wheel. We are literally in one of the most pivotal technological eras in human history. The price of energy is in free fall for a huge % of the human population.

I never said we should only buy when it is at 15.  I'm not sure where you got that.  Most of the 90s were in the 20s.  Late 90s through 2001 were over 30.  Mid-2000s were mid-20s.  Financial crisis was under 20 for over a year.  I never argued that we should only buy when Shiller is low.  I'm only arguing against the idea that it wasn't low during the financial crisis.\n\nTrendline is what matters for Shiller PE.  Interest rates have dropped over time, which has led to higher multiples over time.  So Shiller PE norms from 40 years ago aren't nearly as relevant as what numbers have looked like over the last couple decades.

If I were using the shiller for anything, these are my thoughts.\n\n    Most of the 90s were in the 20s.\n\nBut bro, the mean for decades before that was about 12! This would have indicated that we were far outside the mean. Again you dont have the benefit of looking forward. You can only look back. The shiller in the 90s had a trend line that was almost 60 degrees (lol) from the late 70s and into the 90s and right through to the .com bubble. Mean was probably under 12 in the 90s... and the mean was fairly consistent for almost a whole century prior to that with a volatile but rather flat trend that always seemed to returned to the mean... the shiller literally would have said \"we are in a bubble\" if you looked at it in the 90s. There was no way I would buy something if I though the shiller was believable.\n\nThis even in the great recession, a shiller 15 still would be questioned. If anything a shiller believer might have thought that this is it, we are returning to the old trend. Thus still over valued. And recall many people did indeed say that. Many bears believed we had another 30-40% to go.\n\nSaid differently, there was no way of knowing that we were moving to a new, seemingly permanent shift in mean and trend unless you knew that computing was going to obliterate the trend. Thats why the shiller mean went up 8 points. Because the economy and world shifted to a much higher degree of efficiency. Crime went down a lot. Productivity skyrocketed. 3rd world countries started to make headway despite what was once considered logistically impossible. This was a major human event and barring WW3 taking us back to the stone age, we are practically in a second enlightenment right now.\n\nAs a total aside, this is why you are seeing social pressure everywhere. Some people are resisting advances in social knowledge and tech and they are doing nasty things to keep the old ways. This is exactly what happened in the enlightenment as well. And just like the folks who lived through the 1st one, most really dont get its happening to them. They know something is up, but they blame it on social media or censorship or politics but whats really happening is the world is moving forward. With or without them.\n\nAnother aside, the MCAT doesnt mean you actually understood the gravity of what you read. Thats all I meant. It wasnt a put down or anything.
