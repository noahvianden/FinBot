Opened an account with TD for their Thinkorswim software and it's been a major crash course on trading in general.\n\nA couple of days ago, after months in paper trading, I placed my first \"small\" options trade with live money.  Ended up pulling the trigger on buying two contracts of $SOFI calls with a $15 strike price and $2.40 premium or $17.40 break-even.  The expiry is 2/18/2022.\n\nEnded up getting crushed today, but have plenty of time before theta decay destroys the trade and recover.  I'm unable to sell calls \"naked\" as a way to hedge the trade, so I bought 100 shares at roughly a $15.52 cost basis.  Haven't opened a hedge yet but I am open to advice on hedging strategies.\n\nIf you look at $SOFI the past year, the share price has dropped approx. 40% - 60% after each earnings call.  Between that, the upcoming earnings call on 3/18/2022 and the pending bank charter, that's why I picked the expiry date.  I believe the share price will rebound at or over the break-even.\n\nCurious about your thoughts on this trade and how I can hedge it properly?  Any advice will help.

I made bad decisions with calls twice when the market was up a lot one day and down a lot another.  Keep this in mind on days like today.  One covered call I sold for $3,000 and bought back when it was at $1,500 when it tanked.

It came back down below my strike and I still made money, but there was still a long time to DTE (like yours currently is) and I should have just waited and not reacted on those really volatile, large move days.
