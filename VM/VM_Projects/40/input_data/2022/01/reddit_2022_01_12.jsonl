{"title": "New trader - am I making serious mistakes or just unlucky?", "selftext": "Hi thetagang,\n\nAt the end of last year, I decided I was going to start learning how to trade options and more specifically, sell options (generally in spreads) to take smaller but lower risk profits. This was to not only build my confidence but also I felt it was a good long-term profit strategy that could scale up. I did a ton of research understanding everything from the super basics, the greeks, strategies, etc. My Mom previously signed up for a course that gave great detail about options trading that I started through (it's 30+ hours per section, haven't finished yet) and she's been highly profitable over the past several years, so she has also acted as a mentor to me through all of this helping checking my understanding and such. For each trade, I made sure I understood the P/L chart, trends, and was confident in my technical analysis (for whatever that's worth).\n\nSince Dec 31, I've made 3 trades (weekly expirations) that have netted me a -40% portfolio loss and one of those trades expired worthless, meaning that loss is from 2 of the 3. \n\nHere are my trades with thoughts:\n\n12/31: NFLX 07 Jan 2022 575/565 Vertical Put\n\n* For the month of Dec, NFLX was trading slightly down but I felt the technical analysis pointed towards a continuation of consolidation and at the time of placing the order, NFLX was at 610. My bet with this trade was that it'd stay above 575. Probability on this showed to be 92% OTM. I ended up taking a massive loss as I held on expecting a reversal that never came. RSI, MACD and candles all (what I thought) represented a reversal but no. Gamma (I think) killed me and I bowed out a few days before expiration around 578. Thankfully I didn't hold much longer as at expiry, it was around 540.\n\n1/6: GOOGL 07 Jan 2022 2700/2690 Vertical Put\n\n* After the mini crash last week, I took a bet that Google's selloff was partially emotionally based and that it would rebound. GOOGL was trading around 2750 when I jumped in but previously had been trading well above 2800. Again, probabilities showed this to be around 95% OTM and thankfully I was right, although just barely as it got a bit sketchy at times.\n\n1/10: NVDA 14 Jan 2022 280/290 Vertical Call\n\n* Final trade and this is from 2 days ago. NVDA, along with several other tech stocks took a tumble and it seemed like we were heading into a bear market. To top it off, NVDA has been bearish since late Nov, so all technicals indicated a good time to take a short position. I swapped to a vertical call over put this time as credits weren't good on the put side and again, I was looking for a very high probability play to help me recover from my NFLX loss. Probability was 98% on this when I entered at 274. I jumped out today at 280 as I've seen nothing but bullish behavior from both the market and underlying since I entered the position and was worried about greater losses if I kept holding. In hindsight, I guess I should have gone to 285 or maybe even 290 but it felt overkill and a big loss in premiums over something that was already so likely to be right.\n\nA few things I've learned, but don't necessarily have answers for yet. \n\n1. I don't have an exit strategy before entering a position. This is really challenging as even the GOOGL trade was showing a 47% loss minutes before expiration, despite me collecting 100% premiums. I find it really difficult to figure out how to exit with minimal losses while still \"being right\". In both losses above, I ended up giving up close to my strike price after markets went against me and took substantial losses in the process. I'd really appreciate some advice here.\n2. I have not been looking at broader market signs or flags and instead was looking at my sector and honestly, more so the chart for the specific stock I was after. I had no idea the Fed minutes were being released last week and that the market would pull back in anticipation, and that cost me.\n3. Finally, I didn't really stick with one stock. As a new trader, it's probably best I think to pick one stock I like, have knowledge in and just trade that. I'm going to do that now moving forward. I'm also going to be using a paper account to test a lot of theories while I gain experience.\n\nThis isn't intended to be a pity me thread. Rather, I'm hoping folks in here can help me understand where I may have gone wrong or missed some things. Everything I read and research tells me this strategy is the one I want and best suits me but yet I've taken huge losses very quickly. Any advice or suggestions would be greatly welcomed.

Position sizing is the #1 tool of risk management. You generally should not be risking more than 5% of your account on a single trade, or even less. If your position sizes are too large, even if you're doing everything else right, you risk huge drops in your portfolio from just one or two cases of bad luck, as you've experienced. It's far easier to experience a 5% drop in portfolio value and then earn back 5.26% to get back to your starting value, than to have it drop 40% and then have to claw back a 67% gain to get back to where it started.\n\nYou correctly point out some key points in your lessons learned as well. You absolutely should have an exit plan for every position you enter, and if you don't have one, don't enter the position. The exit plan should include under what conditions you take profits, e.g. take profit at a fixed % of max gain vs. hold through expiration no matter what vs. close at a certain DTE no matter what. It should also include under what conditions you cut your losses if the trade goes against you, e.g. close if you reach a loss of 2x premium received vs. hold through expiration for max loss. For defined risk strategies like credit spreads, you already have a built-in max loss. People often size their spread positions such that this built-in max loss represents the maximum they're willing to lose, so if they have a losing spread they just let it run, since they had accepted upfront that they were willing to take this max loss before entering the position.\n\nOne point I didn't understand is that you said you were \"showing a 47% loss minutes before expiration, despite...collecting 100% premiums.\" You always collect the full premium upfront when you first sell the spread, so that doesn't mean anything with regard to what the current market value of your position is. You were showing a 47% loss because it cost 47% more to close the spread at that point in time than the premium you received.\n\nYou're also right that broader market conditions matter, and you should be aware of things like FOMC meeting minute releases (usually the Wednesday 3 weeks after each meeting) and macroeconomic data releases that could cause greater volatility or directional movement in the broader markets.\n\nOn the point about sticking with one stock: this comes down to trading style. I would say that if you think your trading performance is suffering because your focus is split across too many tickers, it makes sense to reduce how many tickers you're looking at. There are successful traders who trade just one ticker, but there are also plenty of successful traders who trade multiple tickers. If you trade just one ticker, you run the risk of tunnel-visioning on it, and there may be better opportunities elsewhere, especially as conditions with the company and the overall market evolve over time.\n\nI'm not sure where you're getting the probability numbers from, but be aware that any probability probably comes from a mathematical model that makes assumptions about the underlying, and these assumptions often don't hold up in practice. In particular, models often don't account very well for fat tails in probability distributions, meaning they underestimate the probabilities of extreme events occurring. For example, if the model is saying there's a 99% chance of an option expiring OTM and the actual (unknowable) probability is 95%, the option is 5x more likely to expire ITM than the model says, which is a huge difference when considering risk/reward over the long term.\n\nThe last suggestion I'd leave you with is to consider trading longer DTE positions. With such low DTE positions, your positions' values are going to be highly sensitive to movements in the underlyings, giving you little time to react to adverse movements. Longer DTE positions (30-45 DTE is pretty popular) will not be as sensitive, and will give you more time to react, as well as more time for the underlying to possibly move back in a favorable direction.", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for taking the time to outline this in such great length. \n\nI agree with your point on the position size. To me, I was looking at the cost of the trade I was making and justifying that as it relates to my portfolio size, not the max possible risk. One of the challenges I came across with the spreads I did was I found the max gain to max loss ratio to be roughly 1:10, meaning if I wanted to have any sort of meaningful premium collection (even $100 would be great), I'd have to take on a much larger risk. In retrospect, maybe this was a sign this particular strategy wasn't right for the size of my portfolio. \n\nFor exit strategy, as mentioned, this is where I find I need help. I'm fine creating an exit strategy for profits but not for losses. This is primarily because my positions seem to fluctuate between -100% and upwards of -500% while still also being well below or above (depending on the trade) my strike, leading to an OTM expiry. I find it very difficult to then say if losses = x% or $x, I'm out. How do you navigate that while still appearing to be right in the trade?\n\nI mentioned in another reply that I got my probability numbers from the [option table](https://www.evernote.com/l/Aiy4Ny5u6WFIUbd4VvEIvOYk2qT32g4zS58). It seems I was misunderstanding how to use this data and clearly my results speak for that misunderstanding too. Nevertheless, I'm still a bit lost how to properly factor in the ITM/OTM probabilities into my decision making. Perhaps I'll see if I can find training on that somewhere.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "No problem. From my perspective, all three of the points you bring up here on position size, exit strategy, and ITM/OTM probabilities are all related to the same issue, which is that the spreads you're using don't have a suitable risk/reward profile for your risk appetite.\n\nA risk/reward ratio of 10:1 is quite high, and requires a very high probability of success to pay off consistently in the long run. If you instead look for spreads with a lower risk/reward ratio, say 3:1 or 2:1, then you're getting more premium per dollar risked. It's true that you would then have a higher probability of going ITM, but such spreads would address all three of your points. You can use a smaller position size, since you don't need as large of a position to get the premium you're looking for. It also caps your max drawdown to -300% or -200% so that it's not possible to reach levels as bad as -500%. And by not playing at the extreme tail end of the probability distribution, it's possible (though not guaranteed) that the probability numbers you're using are more valid, since you're not in the fat tail of the distribution anymore where mathematical models tend to underestimate probabilities.\n\nA common approach for credit spreads is to sell with the short leg at 30 delta with 30-45 DTE, aiming for a premium of 1/4 to 1/3 of the spread width (i.e. risk/reward ratio of 3:1 to 2:1) if possible. If you're getting less than this in premium, you may be risking too much for comparatively too little reward. Compared to the spreads that you were doing, spreads like this have a higher probability of going ITM, but have a better risk/reward tradeoff. Keep in mind that this is just a general guideline and could vary significantly by underlying, and you shouldn't just apply it mechanically without understanding the underlying and having an investment thesis behind your decision.\n\nOn the point about exit plan for losses: this comes down to discipline, i.e. having a plan in advance and sticking to it. Your exit plan should reflect an unemotional assessment of how far the underlying needs to move against you for you to consider your original investment thesis proven wrong. Remember, in the long run, your profitability depends just as much on how well you can mitigate your losses as how often and large your profits are. Again, with credit spreads, you should already be thinking about the max loss you're willing to take when deciding the size of the position (including both the number of contracts and the spread width). It's valid to say that your exit plan for a losing credit spread is just not doing anything and continuing to hold in hope of recovering, as long as it's sized appropriately such that you can accept taking the built-in max loss.\n\nFor newer traders looking to build up trading discipline, I would say it's generally better to trade 30-45 DTE options than <7 DTE options. The swings in your positions won't be as large, so there won't be as much emotion involved and you'll have time to rationally assess whether your exit plan requires you to take action. You'll also have more time and buffer in the underlying's price for the trade to work itself out in your favor. While it's true that theta decay is greatest in the last week to expiration, the trade-off is the increased sensitivity to movements in the underlying close to expiration (gamma risk). Many people, including experienced traders, choose to forgo the higher theta decay in order to avoid taking on this elevated gamma risk; some people always close their positions at say 7-21 DTE.\n\nOn the point about probabilities: I don't think you were necessarily misusing them or misunderstanding what they mean. As I described in my previous comment, the problem is that when you're that far out on the probability distribution, the probability is likely to be inaccurate due to the limitations and assumptions of the model used, and even what appears to be a small inaccuracy can have huge implications.\n\nFor example, the difference between a 1% chance of ending up ITM and a 2% chance of ending up ITM is much bigger than it might seem. Suppose you have a strategy where you expect to make a small profit in the long run, where the probabilities say that 99% of your trades will be winners and 1% will be losers. Each winner earns you $1, each loser loses $90. You would expect that after 100 trades, you make $99 from your winners and lose $90 from your one loser, netting $9 (i.e. the expected profit per trade is $0.09). But then, suppose that these probabilities were slightly wrong, and the actual probabilities were 98%/2%. Now, you would expect to make $98 from your winners and lose $180 from your losers, netting -$82 - a huge difference in net profit due to just a small inaccuracy in the original probabilities.\n\nContrast this with a strategy where the probabilities say that 70% of your trades will be winners and 30% will be losers. Let's say that again, each winner earns $1, and to keep the expected profit per trade the same as before ($0.09), each loser loses $2.033. Since the expected profit per trade is the same as before, we again expect that after 100 trades, you net $9 (70 \\* $1 - 30 \\* $2.033). Suppose that your probabilities are again underestimating the probability of a loser by 1%, and are actually 69%/31%. Now, you would net $5.97 in total profit. The 1% inaccuracy in the original probabilities, while still significantly impacting your total profit, matters far less for this strategy than for the first strategy.\n\nYou can see from these examples how if you're selling at very low delta, you would need very accurate probabilities, which is likely not possible. By selling at higher delta, i.e. lowering probability of success but also lowering risk/reward ratio, you become less exposed to inaccuracy in the probabilities.\n\nOne last point related to position sizing that comes to mind is that if you have multiple positions open, be careful about how strongly correlated they are. The benefit of diversifying and having multiple smaller positions diminishes if the underlyings are all strongly positively correlated with each other.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "This gives me a lot to think about and I fear I think I'm more confused than before with regards to the best way to use probabilities. \n\nI get what you're saying in that the higher the probability, the higher the max loss potential is. When you factor that into possible errors with probability calculations, that can really hurt. I also understand that because of these reasons, one option might be to use a spread with a max loss equal to my personal risk threshold but decrease probability of success to increase the max return ratio. If I understand your points correctly, while I may be wrong more often than in my existing strategy, limiting my max loss not only gives me a better defined exit strategy but also allows me to survive when I'm wrong more so than now. Do I understand you right? If so, it seems the highlighted strategy in [this screenshot](https://www.evernote.com/l/AixR7P8HyQ1IK5s1mUAiFNAAIbFIioz-pP4) fits (Paper account, after hours with a random guess on an underlying with no technical analysis. Just picked something to get some numbers to play with).\n\nWhat I like about this concept is that it provides a larger possible max return, allowing me to exit much earlier and take profits at reasonable amounts without needing to stress to expiration. \n\nFor  the point on multiple positions, can you explain that a bit more? Are you referring to taking multiple positions on the same underlying? if so, I don't quite follow the other points you make as they'd all have the same correlation, no?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yup, I agree with what you said here. The highlighted strategy would fit the criteria I described, except the delta on the short leg is probably too high, if I'm reading it correctly. The short leg at 145 is currently ITM with AMD currently at 137, so its delta is most likely greater than 50, rather than the target of 30. This means that the probability of success of this trade may be too low for this to be an attractive opportunity. There's always going to be a trade-off between probability of success and the amount of premium you get, so it's up to you to select strikes and DTEs consistent with how you want to make this trade-off. And again, the guidelines I described can be tailored to different tickers that have different behaviors. However, if you can't find an acceptable way to make this trade-off for a particular ticker, it might not make sense to trade the ticker at the current time.\n\nOn the point about correlation of multiple positions: it could refer to multiple positions on the same underlying, but it doesn't have to. Suppose you have bullish spreads open on 10 different underlyings, each with max loss of 5% of your account. If the 10 underlyings are highly positively correlated, they'll have a strong tendency to move together in the same direction; if one goes down, they all go down. This means that there's a good chance that if one of your underlyings is tanking, they're all tanking. In such an event, there would be a decent possibility of ending up with max loss on all of the spreads, wiping out 50% of your account. This is essentially barely any better in terms of risk than having a single spread position that's 10x the size of one of the individual spreads with max loss of 50% of your account.\n\nIn contrast, if the underlyings are weakly correlated or even negatively correlated, and/or if your spreads are a mix of bullish and bearish, it becomes a lot less likely that the spreads will all tank at the same time, making the possibility of hitting the max 50% drawdown much less likely. You can achieve this by diversifying your underlyings by attributes like sector and geography. Having a mix of bullish and bearish spreads can help too, assuming the underlyings are positively correlated (i.e. they tend to move in the same direction), though in a strongly trending market it can be hard to pick spreads that go against the trend. It can also be helpful to stagger the DTEs of your open positions; if some adverse short-term event occurs that tanks the spreads that are expiring soon, your longer DTE positions might not be as strongly affected and still have time to recover.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "~~When you talk about delta, are you talking about the net delta of the spread itself or just the sell side?

The premium that you'll get will vary a lot based on the underlying, since some underlyings have had relatively lower/higher historical volatility and thus have relatively lower/higher IV, compared to other underlyings. \n\nGenerally, you want to be considering IV rank or IV percentile to help decide whether to use a credit spread or debit spread, which can be more important for this decision than the actual value of IV. IV rank and IV percentile indicate how high an underlying's IV is relative to its own past IV. The point is that IV tends to stay within a band for a given underlying, so if it's currently near the top of that band, it will be more likely to revert downward than shoot up out of that band. In such cases, i.e. when IV rank or IV percentile is high, selling credit spreads makes sense since declining IV is favorable for such positions, i.e. credit spreads have negative vega. In contrast, when IV rank/percentile are low, there's a decent chance IV will revert upwards, which is favorable for positive vega positions like debit spreads. I think TastyTrade's recommendations use this general principle too.\n\nGoing back to the spread you linked - $F historically doesn't have super high IV, so you generally get lower premium on it than if you choose an underlying that has higher IV. However, $F's current IV rank/percentile is high due to the big run up it's had recently, so A) it's giving more premium than it does historically, and B) it's probably more justified to sell credit spreads rather than buy debit spreads, in the expectation that IV will revert back down at some point, though the exact timing of this reversion is unknowable. These points can help you make the decision of whether to enter a trade and what kind of position to enter, but they should be supported by an underlying investment thesis as well. E.g. if you plan to sell a bull put spread, your investment thesis should justify your directional forecast and/or provide reasoning for why you think the market is potentially overpricing the spread you're planning to sell.\n\nOne pitfall to watch out for is that based on the points above, it might appear that you'd want to sell premium on underlyings with both high absolute level of IV and high IV rank/percentile. This is a potential trap though; you should always remember that IV reflects the market's perception of the future realized volatility of the underlying. So if an underlying has very high IV, the market is essentially saying that its future price is highly unpredictable, and so it's very hard to justify any investment thesis that relies on any price prediction. This is where people get burned trading options on high IV meme stocks; they can give very high premium, but in a lot of cases it's almost impossible to know whether that premium is worth the risk, given the highly uncertain probabilities involved. In addition, such stocks are less likely to exhibit rangebound IV, so even selling premium at a high IV rank/percentile might not be the right move, since your position can be hurt by IV shooting up even higher to previously unseen levels.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Those are huge losses for such a short amount of time.

Obviously iron is used for making steel, copper used in electronics and nickel in batteries all key materials that are in high demand by the electronic vehicle industry which is a hot sector right now. \n\nThe P/E ratio (TTM) is around 4x which is extremely low relative to the average 15 P/E in the materials sector.

In prior years they always paid out an irregular dividend but in 2020 they normalized their payouts to at least two per year in March and September with possibly more. Vale has tremendous free cash flow and will likely continue to payout substantial dividends, the first dividend will be announced late February around Q4 earnings. \n\nThe stock is very reasonably priced and very buyable by your average robinhood/webull/wealthsimple retail trader which makes it appealing as a meme or hype stock.

{"title": "Inflation is About to Go Up, Not Down", "selftext": "I don't have 3 hours to write this, so let's put this in point form.  Hopefully you retards will digest it better this way.  \n\n* Inflation is a supply issue, not a demand issue\n   * Technology is deflationary for goods (and some services).  Globalization is deflationary for labor.\n* COVID has disrupted the supply chain in multiple ways\n   * Shutdowns in response to virus in major manufacturing countries (China, Vietnam, most of Asia really)\n   * Demand has become more volatile, people don't know how much to produce.  Technology can usually predict how much goods to create months in advance, not possible in this environment.  Technology's deflationary impact thus greatly reduced.\n* This has been coupled with increase in supply for some goods\n   * Chips, appliances, food (meat, coffee), you name it\n   * This would have been highly predictable and supply chains could have efficiently adjusted for this shift in a regular environment.  COVID makes it hard to tell where the demand spikes will hit next.\n* Yes, stimulus checks and other COVID relief monetary policy have contributed to this increase in demand, although this impact is winding down\n\nThis isn't exactly news.  But this is the base case right now.  The idea is that supply chains are getting back online and the system is returning to normal.  Unfortunately, there is a big wrench about to get thrown into the system.\n\nChina.  Or as our boy Donnie calls it, Gina.  Gina is a problem.  That's because China makes up over a quarter of the world's manufacturing output.\n\nHere's why China is about to become a disaster for the next 3 months or more, and why this will completely dummy global supply chains even further.  Jerome Powell can set interest rates @ 20% tomorrow and it won't change the situation in China.\n\n* China targeting 0 COVID strategy\n   * China 0 COVID is brutal.  City-wide, sometimes province-wide lockdowns.  Months where you literally cannot leave your house.  \n   * There are no exceptions for factory workers.  Hell, half these motherfuckers work at factories.  You don't get 0 COVID by giving out a bunch of exceptions.  \n* Omicron has spread in the community in China.  Omicron is quickest spreading illness in human history.\n   * Once Omicron is moving, it's impossible to stop\n   * There's no way China will be able to control it, even with their measures\n* The longer China stays stubborn on 0 COVID, the more the supply chain is going to get FKED.  \n   * Olympics are coming, China must hold the line until they end.  That's Feb 20th.  Good luck.\n   * China has proven to be relentless in their pursuit of 0 COVID\n   * Chinese vaccines are world's worst against Omicron, population is COVID-naive (except those Wuhan mf's)\n* China will eventually fail and pivot strategy, but it will take months.  In that time, Omicron will demolish the supply chain in China and thus the globe\n* We'll start seeing inflation prints at 10%+\n* Short term impact on companies manufacturing pre-dominantly in China = disaster\n\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk.

If you believe monetary policy is the cause of all valuation, then that becomes a function of faith. The people on here who harp on monetary policy all the time deal in binary dichotomies more often than not, and base their position largely on their belief and not raw data.\n\nOnce you start introducing nuance to macroeconomics, like you're doing, they fall apart and have to reject any view that is unorthodox from the perspective of a monetary policy-focused view of the world.\n\nThat's not to say that monetary policy isn't a major part of the equation for valuation... of course it is, but whenever anyone mentions any other factor these people come out of the woodwork and try to bash it down because there's a cognitive dissonance involved. If monetary policy isn't all that matters in macroeconomic reality, then they probably have to change a lot of their economic views, but more dangerously to their egos they have to change their perspective on social and political issues in many cases, too, and that's true for all political ideologies as they all have different monetary policy hawkish positions.\n\nOf course, the truth is a combination of the two... monetary policy matters, but so do the larger issues you're talking about.\n\nThis is why you're getting the response that you're getting. You're 100% correct that there are these other factors, but they can't acknowledge that. The data right now demonstrates a rise in spending and demand year over year, but the people making this argument are like the people citing the price of gas in May 2020 to say that we're super expensive now. What they're not doing is zooming out the graphs and seeing that we're just gapping back up to the prior trend for the most part. Capital velocity indicates that, as well. So do earnings reports and inflation numbers that show that most of the inflation is coming from the supply side, NOT spending pressure so much (not that it's not a factor, but consumer debt has only increased at the normal 1% trend... the money people think has entered the market isn't being spent the way they think it is).\n\nBreaking a supply chain is easy, but building it back up takes time and during that time, supply issues will cause prices to rise. That's Capitalist Macroeconomics 101. Why people believe that's not a factor during a global pandemic is because of this ideological blindspot they have.\n\nHaving said that, there are two strains of thought on here on monetary policy affecting the market:\n\n1. \"Fed turn money printer off! Money printer not go Brrrrr anymore!\" Don't listen to these people. None of them know how the financial system works. Many of them actually think the Fed prints money or releases it directly into the economy. They don't realize that the Fed is still generating liquidity and will be for some time, and even when they start it's going to take well over a decade to claw back the money they put out and even then, probably not. So the liquidity in the market, which mostly hasn't entered the market yet, will still be there, supporting your argument. There is an argument that perception of money policy being hard will affect the mentality of investors, and there's some truth to that, but that argument ignores the power of greed in an economic bounceback, which I would argue is the stronger force.\n2. The idea that bond buybacks ending will create a situation where bond yields will rise and that will create an offset to the market, drawing capital out of the market.\n\nThat last argument has some truth to it, though that's not what you're going to run into most of the time. It's worth exploration.\n\nThe bond yield argument basically comes down to a long-standing pattern in the market where traditionally growth stocks, given all the oscillation in the market, generate long-term gains around 2% for high risk, give or take. That's why whenever the 10 year Tbill elevates above 1.6% growth stocks take a hit until they start to slump back down. If Tbill yields get too good, they become a low risk generator of income compared to stocks.\n\nThe Fed changing the taper policy and changing rates inherently creates a situation that benefits bond yields. You saw a very similar thing happen after 2008.\n\nAnd then something weird happened: the market didn't go down and stay down like people thought it would, even as the Fed reversed policy to pull 2008's QE out of the market. The bond market expanded heavily, and the stock market expanded with it, which wasn't supposed to happen. That's because the increase in overall liquidity created an opportunity to buy the bonds as the yields went up, which created a risk offset. Put short, bonds and cash are boring, and stocks are interesting and timing the market well can generate significant gains.\n\nPeople cite 2018 as an argument against this, saying rate hikes created negative returns over the year, but what those people ignore is that the two major declines during the year were during government shutdowns, and government shutdowns and debt default scares inherently tank the market. If you bought SPY at the end of the first shutdown and sold prior to the September repositioning, you would have made 20% on your money even through rate hikes. Basically, the narrative they're selling (even on TV and in financial journals) is a false narrative that doesn't match the way the market traded.\n\nBut there is truth to the bond yield argument having an effect on how the market trades, and what you can expect from the market this year is HEAVY volatility because one day, bond yields will go up and this'll start a cyclical rotation... people will sell equities, buy bonds and lock in higher yields, then they'll get bored two days later and use their risk offset to buy more equities. Rinse and repeat. This'll freak some people out and drive other people to invest out of greed and fomo, so I personally think we're looking at a positive year overall.\n\nIf this is the end of the pandemic, then that means the supply chain will loosen up... but wait, if you read earnings reports, companies are buying from multiple suppliers in many cases in order to ensure stock because of these issues. The JIT system doesn't do a good job scaling up capacity, so they lag... that means that eventually demand will wane, but supply will continue to push as if it's constant because that's how the JIT system works in cases like this. They are overcompensating, and a supply glut will follow, and that means disinflation and possibly deflation. (These are the same thing but people who think \"deflation\" is only relative to whatever subjective arbitrary number they think the \"real price\" is get really confused when you don't mean prices will just go back to what they want... LOL)\n\nI'm a macroeconomist who does fintech prediction work and my models suggested that inflation YoY should be beyond 7.6% right now, but it's coming in lower. I think Omicron is part of that, but there are other human causes, too... I'm not that surprised, as I've been saying this would start to cool for a while now, but it definitely indicates that inflation is slowing and we're seeing some reflection in the numbers that some sectors are seeing reduction in pressure. Omicron will reset that a little bit, but I think in 6 months we may be looking at a much more moderate number and if the Fed moves too quickly and aggressively, a problem with asset devaluation IF they lean in too hard. If not, things should be pretty good in the market, but still volatile because of the bond yields issue.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
