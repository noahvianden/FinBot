I will run one contract since this is my first PMCC and it takes up a lot of margin (around 4500).\n\n2. I will sell weekly, because I do have the time to watch the market and adjust and roll if necessary, and weekly gives a higher return. I entered the trade yesterday with Microsoft at 305 (should have done it at the end of the day with MSFT at 300, but that doesn't really matter long term) and sold the 4DTE 312.5 Call for an easy 1.11 credit. As far as I know, 30-45 is advantageous because of the lower effort and management, but since I have the time I think weeklies are more profitable. Please correct me if I'm wrong. \n\n3. Since I will be watching my positions closely, I'm definitely looking to roll before the short call goes ITM. If it actually goes ITM, I'm still gonna look to roll for a credit if possible, if it goes super deep ITM for some reason, I don't mind closing out the trade for a profit. \n\n4. If MSFT tanks I will be looking into the reasons why it tanked, since I think it's a super solid company with a much better long-term set up than FB. I bought the Jan 24 Call, so if it tanks within the next year I will probably hold on and keep selling Calls, since I'm quite convinced it will come back. Depends on how much it tanks, of course. \n\n5.

All things I've learned (the hard way) to ask myself prior to opening a trade. Just trying to help you learn from my mistakes. Great answers and well thought out responses, so I'll just give some high level responses and should be good to go on making tendies for the long term. \n\n1. Nothing wrong with 1, gotta start somewhere. I've found diversifying my PMCC amongst a handful of tickers I like helps eliminate some single stock risk to the portfolio. \n2. I used to sell exclusively weeklies as well, just like you was allured with the higher per week premiums compared to 30-45 DTE. I'm now selling 30 DTE because my short call kept getting blown through almost every week, even though I was only selling .2 Delta calls. Not a bad thing as my LEAPS were printing, but still a pain. So I moved to 30 DTE and have been happier with it. To each their own here, and in a sideways to bear market you will come out ahead of me in premium received, in a bull market I might beat you in total returns. My advice: research Gamma and really wrap your head around the risks associated with it and weeklies. \n3. Agree 100% here with rolling prior to the short call going ITM. I've tried to just sit tight and see if it would come back down. It's dang hard to get a roll OTM, with a credit, from a short call that is deep ITM. Much easier to roll for a credit when the short call is ATM. Plus you keep the short call OTM this way. \n4. Good answer. With the strike you picked you have plenty of downside protection to keep selling calls against on the way down and pocket the premium along the way. \n5. My thoughts here are try to hold the LEAPS longer than a year for taxes. Getting taxed at 15% Long Term is WAY better long term than trying to swing trade the LEAPS and run PMCC at the same time getting in and out of the market. \n\nWelcome to the MSFT PMCC Club!", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Have not bought yet, but I will probably soon.\nI agree on the catch-22, it's probably better to start theta farming early as possible", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "Are you looking to sell a put?

{"title": "Housing Market to the moon and beyond", "selftext": "TL;DR: wealth gap in the US only increased, rich got insanely richer and it will be even harder to afford buying a home now going forward. \n\nHousing market theory: It will never be the same boyz. Maybe slight pullbacks but its gone forever upward. If u cant afford a home now then its only going to get more expensive. Market will continue up and heres why: \n\nPandemic caused supply shortages which affected contractor costs and speed to build homes which translated to higher home prices. US literally built like 300k less houses in 2020 compared to 2019. Low supply with excess demand = inflation on prices. Simple supply and demand economics there. \n\nNow, since the FED printed trillions of money and forced interest rates low, money became cheap. People began taking out more loans and willing to pay large amounts over the original asking prices on homes. Thats terrible because then the comps and appraisals on that block also go based off that going forward. Say a house like John‚Äôs sells for $400k, but he asked for $350k, then any other house on the block with the same floors/baths/bedrooms setups will be valued based off that house sold for,  the $400k, not the asking price. \n\nThen, with the home values appreciating ridiculously it also allowed for home owners to take out larger loans to value on their properties for more investment opportunities like...  Another property/dream home. \n\nAlso, because of the pandemic there was Covid-relief forbearance where you could literally stall your mortgage payments or pay significantly less for no penalties. So, lets say the avg mortgage is $1,600 a month (according to a 2018 US census it was so it may even be higher now) then after 12 months of forbearance that's $19,200 saved. An FHA loan only requires 3.5% downpayment. A house selling for a realistic $300k - $400k would then require only $10,500 - $14,000 downpayment. \n\nThe emergence of DEFI technology allowed people to take massive loans on their crypt0 that appreciated several thousand %, or allowed them to sell off their crypt0 for massive gains. The college juniors or senior students now who were brilliant by investing their excess grants/loans could've easily turned a few thousand into crypt0 into a few hundred thousand now and easily bought homes. Example: $3,000 into the dog token (much wow) in Jan 2019 couldve gotten u a return of over $714,000 when it hit $0.50, nvm when it hit like $0.74. Crazy gains there. Even when it hit at $0.10 the token wouldve gotten u a return of over $142,000. \n\nStock market was also like a casino the last 2 years so that also couldve led to a lot of money flowing into real estate with the short squeezes all over. Look up who roaring kitty is and youll see what I mean off his gamestop bets. He had shares AND call options. He exercised his call options to buy more shares and hold for the long term but at one point i seen his options bets were worth like $700k-$1.4M. Something crazy like that. Nuts. Tons of amateurs made ridiculous money. I love that though. POWER TO THE APES! Retail investing isn‚Äôt and hasn‚Äôt been fair. Built for big money with their fancy algorithms, current patterned day trader rules, lack of financial literacy in schools, FUD media put out literally by media owned by hedge funds, and much more. \n\nThere will never be a more safer asset than real estate. It provides actual physical use, has the ability to generate passive income in rent, and generally ALWAYS appreciates in value. No matter what, real estate is where the money is. Don‚Äôt believe me? Look into how much real estate Bershire holdings or Blackrock bought up the last 2 years and their willingness to pay higher than asking price on many of those homes.
