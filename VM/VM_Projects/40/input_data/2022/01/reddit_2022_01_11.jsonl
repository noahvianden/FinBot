What's the Fed's stance on social, racial, climate equality issues?\n18. How can the Fed be independent, and not engage in \"controversial\" issues - the Fed's dual mandate is full employment and price stability - not on social issues.\n\nEtc.\n\nI will also post my analysis on inflation, the federal reserve meeting in the coming days!\n\n**10:23AM ET: Jerome Powell** \"Post pandemic will look different than past. Monetary policy will need to be used differently.\n\n**10:23AM ET: Jerome Powell** \"Will use monetary policy to combat climate change etc\"\n\n**10:24AM ET: Jerome Powell** \"Cybersecurity, digital currencies, other threats\"\n\n**10:24AM ET: Jerome Powell** \"Trust - will meet with elected colleagues, I will be impartial\"\n\n**10:26AM ET:** Q: Does Omicron cause inflation? A: Yes you can see both demand going up and supply chain issues\"\n\n**10:27AM ET:** Q: FSOC: Does the Fed do climate change stress tests? A: yes we do, but it's a bit different to other institutions. Q: Will you make this a priority? A: Yes, I will do this within supervision.\n\n**10:28AM ET** Q: Is it important for the Fed to address racial, social inequality issues? A: Yes - highly desirable to make a labor market strong to help all sectors of the economy.\n\n**10:31AM ET** Q: **If we have 3/4 IR increases of 25 basis points each**, we still have accomodative stances with negative real interest rates - is it realistic to bring back inflation? A: We have strong demand, but low supply like cars. Shifts in demand will be fixed with greater supply. **We believe we shall a revert back to normal supply this year. Participation rate is slowly increasing.** High inflation is a threat to maximum employment.\n\n**10:35AM ET** Q: FOIA on Fed's political advocacy\n\n**10:37AM ET** Q: Will rising IRs cause wage increases to slow down? A: We believe due to higher inflation, we need to move from a very accomodative market to a less one - it shouldn't have too much effect on wage increases.\n\n**10:40AM ET** Q: The Fed's instruments normally affect the Demand side - how can the Fed fix the Supply side issues eg on cars ie the chip shortage? A: The Fed can affect the demand and the supply side and it's a combination of the 2.\n\n**10:42AM ET** Q: **Why has the Fed changed it's stance on transitory inflation? Do you have evidence? We first thought transitory since supply side should have been alleviated quicker.** We didnt see a supply chain collapse and labor market collapse. We forecasted now, we should see lower inflation. We're not seeing a lot of progress in supply chain alleviations. Look at the ports - the number of ships at anchor at a record low. We did forsee the large spike in demand - but we didn't see it to be on final demand goods. The US economy is too dynamic - there are so many constraints - people need to buy cars, but chips are short - we've never seen this before.\n\n**10:46AM ET** **We believe the supply blockages will be alleviated this year. We believe the Fed will reduce its balance sheet sometime this year.** We'll some more cars, but it'll take some more time.\n\n**10:48AM ET** Q: Latino underrepresentation. American Rescue Plan. A: Problem is not lack of demand, but a significant supply side problem. The unemployment rate is dropping dramatically. We have a labor supply problem, not a demand problem. Threat of price stability - if inflation becomes entrenched in people's thinking, it will lead to more aggressive monetary policy which can lead to a recession. We need price stability, so we need to use our tools to balance the demand and supply side.\n\n**10:51AM ET Q: Do you think the supply side issues will be fixed? A: Yes, but at what speed? Too slow will make inflation to be entrenched, but we believe so eventually. We didn't expect cases to be so high even now**\n\n**10:52AM ET** Q: Omicron. A: We didn't have too much information especially on vaccines, so we listen to the medical professionals.\n\n**10:53AM ET** Q: Digital currencies report - why delay - centralisation? A: Report done - will be shown in the coming weeks.\n\n**10:55AM ET Inflationary pressures seem to last until the MIDDLE of next year - CORRECTION from Powell \"I mean THIS YEAR\".**\n\n**10:56AM ET Unemployment is very low. We believe this year, we end QE March this year, we'll see IR rises, and by the end of this year, balance sheet reductions.**\n\n**11:00AM ET The timing of the pandemic could affect the Fed's movements. If medical experts are right and Omicron will peak in a month's time, we'll see lower hiring for now.**\n\n**11:01AM ET The median for IR increases was 3. We ALL see IR increases this year.**\n\n**11:02AM ET Inflation gas prices, car prices - there are bottlenecks in the supply side? Food - I can see 4 big companies charing higher prices, but livestock is fine - can the Fed affect supply side instead of demand side issues?**\n\n**11:04AM ET Post pandemic economy - we believe it'll take quite some time to draw people back into the labor market.**\n\n**11:20AM ET Asset portfolio - Fed should reduce balance sheet quicker? We shall talk about this on January 26. The economy is in a different stance than before - we should reduce the asset purchasing sooner. We take 3-4 meetings to find consensus on this issue.**\n\n**11:25AM ET Senator Warren Q: Are profit margins supposed to be high or low in a competitive market? In principle can companies just raise prices if they're a monopoly? Companies are reporting dramatic profit margins recently - this means the increased costs could be because they want to make more prices due to supply side issues. Price gouging. Climate change - we need for the Fed to manage risk and financial stability for climate change - it can affect whole institutions. So the Fed must have a important role in climate chnage.**\n\n**11:33AM ET** Keynesian economics. To get out of recession - spend more to increase consumption. But he also said to go back to a surplus budget right? How much debt is too much?\n\n**11:40AM ET How will the Fed focus on climate change? We have a limited but important role.
