So, economic activity is slowing ... Although there are tentative signs supply chain issues are easing ... clouding outlook for 2nd half of economy ... in particular the full re-opening of the economy is supporting spending in the services, as people start to travel again, and tourism will help the economy during the 3rd quarter ... fiscal policy will help reduce burden from higher energy prices ... fiscal policies should preserve debt sustainability ... inflation increased to 8.6% in June, surging energy prices were the most important factor ... global markets shows energy will stay elevated. Food prices are high, due to Russia's war. Services supply chain are contributing to the high rate of inflation.

It's possible  to form a prediction for the upcoming months or expected value with a little forecasting.  There's a lot of economic indicators (GDP, TREAP, unemployment, federal funds rate, etc) in the equation, and I'm constantly looking for more to include to refine it's results.   Next rev will probably include CPI, it doesn't currently.  \n\nIt seems in this market, we have been so bullish in '20 and '21 that the market has actually been lagging the indicators and slow to correct.  It appears that SPX should be closer to 3500 with the economic signals that we're seeing now.  We would need a rebound in UMCSENT to well above 60 to justify values above 390, and I don't see that happening in the short term.  The good news is that even if the economy really slides into the ditch, the money supply has been pumped so much that the floor for the SPX would probably be around 3000-3300 without a black swan type event.  \n\nAnyway, I'd be interested to know what economic data you find especially relevant or that you feel correlate to the value of the markets.

{"title": "Elon Musk's right hand man Omead Afshar has been fired by Tesla for allegedly procuring \"special glass\" for Musk's personal use.", "selftext": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-21/tesla-tsla-executive-under-scrutiny-in-internal-probe\n\nAutomaker to part ways with executive Afshar: people familiar\n\nOmead Afshar, one of Elon Musk’s top lieutenants and the executive running Tesla Inc.’s Texas factory, is under scrutiny in an internal investigation for his role in a plan to purchase hard-to-get construction materials, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nTesla has already fired some employees in relation to the probe, and the electric-vehicle maker plans to part ways with Afshar, likely through a leave of absence initially, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information. Terms of his exit are still being worked out.\n\nAfshar declined to comment. Tesla and Musk didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe internal investigation, led by Tesla Acting Head of Legal David Searle, started after a purchase order for construction material was identified as suspicious, the people said.\n\nThe order, for a special kind of glass, was flagged to Tesla’s finance and internal audit groups earlier this year, the people said. Investigators are trying to determine whether the glass was for Tesla Chief Executive Officer Musk’s personal use, people with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nGlobal supply chain disruptions have made the glass difficult to secure, but Tesla’s status as a global manufacturing powerhouse makes it easier for the company to acquire materials in high demand.\n\nAfshar had requested the purchase order be created and told the workers involved it was for a secret project, the people said.\n\nAfshar has continued to work at the Austin, Texas, plant this week, but is likely to take a leave of absence as the investigation continues, the people said.\n\nAs one of Musk’s top executives at Tesla, Afshar has been in charge of overseeing the construction and then production at the plant in Austin, Texas. A member of the office of the CEO since 2017, his most recent job title was listed on his LinkedIn page as a cowboy hat emoji.\n\nInside Tesla, Afshar was seen as Musk’s fixer, dispatched to smooth out kinks in the operation. In a 2019 interview at the University of California at Irvine, his alma mater, Afshar said he’d performed many roles at Tesla over the years.\n\n“I focus on where there’s a problem, so a lot of firefighting. If there’s an issue, that’s where I am,” he said. “Usually when people see me they’re not always happy, because it means there’s a problem.”\n\nAfshar graduated from UC Irvine in 2009 with a degree in biomedical engineering and a season’s experience as a ski instructor at California’s Mammoth Mountain, according to his LinkedIn profile. He worked for more than six years at St. Jude Medical Inc. and its acquirer, Abbott Laboratories, in product engineering and managing roles before joining Tesla, part of a cohort of young, ambitious executives handpicked by Musk to carry out orders.\n\nHe’s been a jack of all trades ever since. In early 2021, as the US was in the beginning stages of a Covid-19 vaccine rollout, Afshar wrote to California’s lead epidemiologist to convey a Tesla board member’s request to assist with distribution of the shot. By this year, Afshar was in Austin, providing tours to potential recruits from the nearby University of Texas. He briefly appeared on stage at Tesla’s Cyber Rodeo event in April, receiving a personal thank-you from Musk himself.", "id": "w4u7eb", "created_utc": 1658443658.0, "score": 35, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 44, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|21|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|671|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w4u7eb)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w4u7eb)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "\"Special glass\" = cocaine", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Unless the \"glass\" refers to meth, this makes no sense.", "score": 84, "replies": [{"body": "The only way it could make sense is if the glass isn't even a real order and the transaction was just a way to hide embezzling.
