Having created Tesla and SpaceX, he believed whatever he touches turns to gold. If he can make Tesla more valuable than all the car companies in the world combined, he can surely make Twitter more valuable than other social media companies. Especially FB. Like how hard can it be? Definitely easier than rockets and electric cars. And also because fuck Zuckerberg. Thats what Elon thought. \n\nHowever,  he didn't account for how much of catshit wrapped in dog shit Twitter is. And the closer he got, he realized how bad it was. Also his timing sucked balls. \n\nIn short, he fucked up big time.

{"title": "I know that this is WSB, but thinking that Elon orchestrated the whole Twitter fiasco just to have an excuse to sell TSLA stock is ridiculous.", "selftext": "I know that some of you lost money and are mad at him about it, but Elon using Twitter as a bait to sell TSLA stock does not make any sense for the following reasons:\n\n1. Elon started acquiring Twitter stock, before he  sold large chunk of TSLA shares, which was done for tax purposes according to him.\n\n 2. Elon acquired the largest portion of the capital needed for the acquisition of Twitter by getting loans against his shares and attracting numerous high-profile outside investors like Larry Ellison and the Qatar state investment fund. He did not need to actually sell his shares to raise money.\n\n3. Buying a company like Twitter requires extensive research and the use of a lot of resources (mainly financial). This was probably planned at least a year in advance, so the great oracle Elon probably did not have the chance to perfectly time his TSLA selling to maximise his profits. \n\n4. Do you actually think that a guy who tweeted that the  TSLA share price is too high cares so much about his shareholders opinion, so he will orchestrate a very expensive and time consuming operation that could potentially greatly harm his public and business persona, just so he will have an excuse to sell his TSLA shares? Musk has stated numerous times that the sole purpose for his accumulation of wealth is to secure the funding for the dream of his life, which is making humans interplanetary species. Couldn't he just have said that he is going to sell a small portion of his TSLA holdings for that reason? \n\n5. No, TSLA stock probably would not have crashed even if he did not state any reason for the reduction of his stake in the company. It is not like he sold 50 percent. Also, have you seen how devoted are the teslabros? \n\n6. No, you won't be able to sue Elon, cuz your calls expired worthless. One of the main reasons why founders and investors make their company's public is because financials markets provide them with great liquidity. \n\nI obviously can't say for certain why Elon decided to back out of the deal. My personal opinion is that he probably just changed his mind  in part due to miner setbacks like the number of bots on the site. As we all know , he is not very stable as a person and it is probably not as deep as many people think it is.", "id": "vv20je", "created_utc": 1657374236.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.57, "num_comments": 43, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|85|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1585|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfr62k/palantir_pltr_is_a_low_bottom_company_and_has/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pa8veq/palantirs_pltr_main_bearish_thesis_low/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qq4sa6/palantirs_fundamentals_are_getting_better_every/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pq8p9v/palantir_requires_10_plus_years_of_experience_for/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tfvs4s/wsb_always_complains_that_dds_about_great/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n9ydod/palantirs_pltr_fundamentals_just_became_even/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nxra0u/dd_on_cleveland_cliffsclf_a_wsb_favourite_that_is/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kwca8e/apple_might_report_historic_earnings_on_27th/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r555ja/if_you_would_like_to_make_a_risky_play_and_have/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/r559e3/if_you_would_like_to_make_a_risky_play_and_have/) \n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vv20je)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vv20je)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Congratulations Sir you have discovered the people who work at the Wendys inside the casino.", "score": 10, "replies": []}, {"body": "if people can just study fundamental or TA,  we will not be having this mess in the first place..I cannot open reddit peacefully today without having to see the word like (elon or musk) on the headlines of every post..this is dumb..you all should be in jail![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Exactly this.
