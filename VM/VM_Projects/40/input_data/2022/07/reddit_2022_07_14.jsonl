I think the only way Powell saves face is to announce an emergency rate hike of 100-175 basis points.  Now fellow smooth brains, please entertain my slightly more wrinkled brain for a moment.  \n\nCPI was way over expectations, rates will rise the next FOMC a minimum of .75, the tricky part is if Powell does nothing until FOMC but wait to raise rates to the expected .75, then he is opening himself up to years of ridicule and possibly some sort of legal issues, if congress wants to make him the scape goat for all the terrible government policies and spending that has put us in this situation to begin with.  \n\nLet’s look ahead, Microsoft has already issued warnings and Apple is apparently “not immune to a recession either”.  Both have earnings on the 26th, two days before the FOMC rate decision.  I think it’s safe to say they will both tank and pull the market down a bit, July earnings are historically rarely good.  After which the market recovers 2 days later and bam, FOMC raises .75 only and the market tanks because it’s not enough or possibly rallies because Powell does what he did last time and act more aggressively like he has been signaling.  In my opinion, either scenario and Powell is fukd!  Why?!\n\nTwo days after FOMC is….. GDP for the second quarter, damn it man, busy week I know!  I just don’t see how Powell comes out of this smelling like anything other than bullshit.  Think about it, GDP is bad, but not negative and the only plus is we are not. “Technically” in a recession.  On the whole we are not a healthy economy, why?  Powell was late to act.  Now for the likely scenario, and yes it’s the most gay scenario I could think off but not what I or the country wants, we miss GDP again and confirm a recession, well fuk!  Now, not only has Powell either acting not aggressively enough or too slow, now we are in a Recession, this would be the straw that pops this bubble we call a market and send us into a real crash!\n\nRemember folks, it’s an election year, if this plays out, the blame game will surely start now.

If Ukraine assassinated her the Russian economy would collapse fairly quickly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey are desperate to break the sanctions regime, so they are going to go with the financial nuclear option.\n\nThey have been throttling their gas supply down to just enough to keep Germany going, but not enough for them to refill their storage tanks. Their plan is to wait until  winter and they will cut gas off completely. The Russians will demand an end to the European sanctions in order for them to resume gas supply. \n\nThis strategy has a major risk to Russia, Germany may be able to conserve enough to make it through winter, other suppliers may be secured in time, or Germany may decide to suffer through and swear off Russian gas forever and tighten sanctions to the point Russia's economy collapses.\n\nRussia just tested the strategy by demanding the return of a gas turbine blaming it as the cause for throttling of Nord Stream 1. Germany blinked and pressured Canada to return the turbine.\n\nRussia did not need that turbine back... they have spares and could have easily taken one from the completed by not operational Nord stream 2... they were just testing the waters.\n\nThey now know the limits of German resolve and will implement their plan.\n\nGermany has already stated that during a gas crisis this winter they will prioritize private households over industry... This will cause massive shortages or industrial goods if that occurs.\n\nWhen this crisis occurs German industry stocks are going to crater. I'm talking COVID crash levels or greater.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo what you want with this information.
