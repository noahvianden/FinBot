{"title": "The South Park Investing Strategy", "selftext": "**Intro**\n\nGreetings you filthy animals! In light of the collapsing market I've been looking for investing strategies that still work (like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/uw86l4/this_is_actually_beating_the_sp_500_this_year/)). This is another one of them!\n\n**The Question**\n\nCould a portfolio that invests in stocks when they're mentioned on South Park actually be a viable investment strategy?\n\n**The Data**\n\nI originally used the South Park Fandom site to brute force scrape every episode script in search of company names listed in the NYSE/NASDAQ database. This picked up a lot of shit and even missed a few obvious ones, like a mention of Campbells Soup in the 2015 episode Red Man's Greed. I needed a different way to get all the data. I hit the jackpot on Wikipedia when I found they have a summary of every episode, complete with a list of references made. I wrote a script to pull the ticker symbols associated with the company names, along with each episode air date. We were in business.\n\n**The Strategy**\n\nBeing mentioned in the episode was our buy signal, so we just needed to test the right time to sell. I played around with a few investment windows - 30 days, 60, 120, 360 - but nothing looked all that impressive. I decided to try a more aggressive approach, completely selling previous holdings as soon as the next company mention occurred. This makes us entirely beholden to South Park as our stock picker, which for some reason is what we want...\n\n**The Positions**\n\n| 2000-12-13|‚ÄòDENN' || 2000-12-13 | ‚ÄòDENN' || 2001-11-07 | ‚ÄòDIS' || 2003-04-30 | ‚ÄòCPB' |\n\n| 2004-11-03 | ‚ÄòWMT' || 2006-10-04 | ‚ÄòBBY' || 2008-03-19 | ‚ÄòCHH' || 2008-04-16 | ‚ÄòSBUX' |\n\n| 2008-10-29 | ‚ÄòBBY' || 2009-03-11 | ‚ÄòDIS' || 2009-03-25 | ‚ÄòAXP' || 2009-10-07 | ‚ÄòCMG', ¬†'MCD', ¬†'TWTR' |\n\n| 2009-10-21 | ‚ÄòWWE' || 2009-11-04 | ‚ÄòHOG' || 2010-03-24 | ‚ÄòTWTR' || 2010-10-13 | ‚ÄòTWTR' |\n\n| 2010-11-03 | ‚ÄòNKE' || 2010-11-10 | ‚ÄòNKE' || 2010-11-17 | ‚ÄòPGR' || 2011-04-27 | ‚ÄòAAPL', ¬†'BBY' |\n\n| 2011-05-18 | ‚ÄòFDX' || 2011-11-02 | ‚ÄòRed Robin' || 2012-10-03 | ‚ÄòWMT' || 2012-10-10 | ‚ÄòAMZN', ¬†'UPS' |\n\n| 2012-10-31 | ‚ÄòNKE' || 2012-11-07 | ‚ÄòDIS' || 2013-11-13 | ‚ÄòSNE' || 2013-11-20 | ‚ÄòMSFT', ¬†'SNE' |\n\n| 2013-12-04 | ‚ÄòMSFT', ¬†'Red Robin' || 2014-10-15 | ‚ÄòLYFT', ¬†'TSLA', ¬†'UBER' || 2014-11-05 | ‚ÄòTWTR' |\n\n| 2014-11-12 | ‚ÄòBBY' || 2014-12-03 | ‚ÄòTWTR' || 2014-12-10 | ‚ÄòTWTR' || 2015-10-14 | ‚ÄòYELP' |\n\n| 2016-09-21 | ‚ÄòTWTR' || 2016-09-28 | ‚ÄòTWTR' || 2017-09-13 | ‚ÄòTWTR' || 2017-10-11 | ‚ÄòNFLX' |\n\n| 2017-10-25 | ‚ÄòROST' || 2017-11-08 | ‚ÄòBYND' || 2017-11-29 | ‚ÄòNFLX' || 2018-12-05 | ‚ÄòAMZN' |\n\n| 2018-12-12 | ‚ÄòAMZN' || 2019-10-02 | ‚ÄòAAPL', ¬†'DIS' || 2020-09-30 | ‚ÄòBuild-A-Bear', ¬†'VIAC' |\n\n**The Results**\n\nUm....\n\nSouth Park. Fucking. Destroys. Of course it does because nothing makes sense. Our South Park strategy returned 1100% over the past 7 years, compared to 200% for the S&P 500. This boils down to a 50% CAGR over the past 7 years with a Sharpe ratio of about 1.4. Not too bad. Now, keep in mind that this strategy basically boiled down to \"buy Build a Bear and $VIAC during the pandemic.\" But gains are gains and this strategy fucking worked. So cheers WSB, you're 2 for 2 on meme strats!\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIdk man... I guess just go with what you feel? If this works then who am I or anyone else to tell you a strategy is dumb. If you put a bunch of time in and do your DD you'll probably lose money. If you think your bowl of Cheerios is telling you to buy Realty Income Corp (look it up) then it'll probably be a winner. Up is down, and Cartman should be hosting Mad Money (which I think he did once, right?). I got inspired to try this strategy by the data-driven investing strategies like on [Quantbase](https://www.getquantbase.com) and this this could be a sweet one to try (they might even have it).\n\nDespite losing my grip on reality a little, this was really fun!

Reflecting on a story from Yahoo Groups I decided to set up a sell order for $35 GTC+After hours.  I was using Datek at the time.  They had the order book live and you could see the buys & sells waiting.  Right at 4:00PM you could watch the book empty out except for the after hours orders which were nonexistent.
