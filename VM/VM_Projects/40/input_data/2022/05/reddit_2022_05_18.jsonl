{"title": "Quick Macro Overview - the Fed is Lying to You", "selftext": "This is going to be relatively short and meme free, adjust expectations accordingly.\n\nOk, couple of housekeeping things first:\n\nMy post that blew up on the mortgage market got deleted by Reddit Site admins after it hit the front page because it was \"promoting hate\" - and let's be honest, I had that coming because we all know that discussing leveraged debt and equity ratios in relation to loan derivatives in intertwining markets of varying liquidity is the first of two steps that ends with you larping down the street in weird outfits.\n\nThere is still a copy of that post up you can reach by clicking on my profile if you want to read it.\n\nCongratulations to everyone that followed my Rivian puts play, the stock dropped almost 30% on May 9th with the lockup expiration as Ford sold off millions of shares.  Also, that play is over, you missed it, don't jump in now, it won't work.\n\nQuick thanks and shoutout to everyone who hit me up with tips or info about the real estate markets.  The most interesting bit I got was this:  **If you set the pre-COVID occupancy rate of NY and SF at 100%, their current commercial real estate occupancy rates as of May 11th are 38.8% and 34.6% respectively.**  These are the two most expensive real estate markets in the country.  That's a LOT of very pricey, heavily financed office and store buildings going unused.  And if you're wondering, no it's not super easy to just convert that space to residential units - the reason is you need a whole lot more plumbing and HVAC and electrical boxes/meters for residential than you do for offices, and it's not super easy to add that stuff to existing buildings.  I mean, it's doable, but it isn't fast or cheap, and often involves upgrading the lines coming into and out of the building as well as just the internal work.\n\nNow, onto the macro picture:\n\nFirst, the Fed has been lying its ass off for months now about cracking down on inflation.  They've been talking a big game since this winter about starting QT, or halting bond purchases, or any number of other things.  Look at what they're actually doing in the bond market - they're still buying billions of dollars of MBS and other bonds every day.  I believe that \"they're for sure going to actually start QT in June or July\" or whatever the next made up date is as much as I believe Biden is really going to turn student loan payments back on in August.\n\nNow, as far as the \"rate hikes\" they've been issuing?  The way the Fed raises interest rates is they increase the amount they charge banks for overnight loans.  It's gone from 0.0-0.25 to 0.75-1.0, which is a .75 basis point hike, right?  Not so fast.  Because if you'll notice, both times JPOW increased the Fed Funds Rate, he ALSO increased the ONRRP rate by the same amount.  The ONRRP is basically the banks lending the Fed money overnight and getting paid interest on it.  The current ONRRP rate is 0.8.  It went from 0.05 to 0.3 at the same time the Fed rate went from 0 to 0.25, and it went from 0.3 to 0.8 at the same time the Fed rate went from .25 to .75.  About $1.8-$1.9 trillion is going through the ONRRP every day.\n\nBasically the fed \"loans\" money to the banks at .75, then \"borrows\" it back at .8 every night.  Now it's not a 1:1 ratio, but it means that some banks are actually at negative rates right now (because they're lending money like they're paying .75 for it when they're actually paying -.05, which is a big increase in profits), while others are not.  Weirdly, it's mostly the big megabanks and wall street that are getting the extra cash out of this deal.  So strange that the guy who bought bonds himself then had the Fed buy the same bonds to drive the value of his up is also corrupt in other ways.  Total shocker.\n\n**Too complex didn't understand: the money printer never stopped going BBRRRR!! and in some ways has increased it's print run to the big boys.**\n\nFinally, the recent earnings reports are flashing giant red lights about the economy.  Home Depot and Apple had big hits, Target, Wal-Mart, and Amazon had big misses.  IE: construction, home improvement and luxury goods are doing well, but basic cheap stuff isn't.  This basically translates to the upper class and prime workforce groups are doing great, but the majority of the country who are in the lower classes are getting their asses handed to them by ever increasing food, housing, gas, and energy costs.  That's going to travel up the chain, and you'll start seeing people who upgraded to Whole Foods and iPhones over the last few years all of a sudden deciding a cheap android and wal-mart are actually perfectly fine replacements.\n\nSome positions and tickers I'm running, but if you follow you'll have a higher cost basis than I do, be aware of that.\n\n12/16 SPY 200p\n\n9/16 SPY 245p\n\n8/19 SPY 295p\n\nAs always, 90%+ of my portfolio is GME shares and leaps.\n\nI've got fair value on AMZN at around $500, and AAPL around $40, but I have no idea if they'll get that low, and if AAPL gets anywhere near that price, I have to imagine that between Buffet and their dragon's hoard of cash it would just be taken private.  They're both boomer P/E and dividend stocks that for some reason are still valued as growth tech plays.  Won't last forever, but this is a case of market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, so take care with those two in particular.\n\nGlobal food shortage this fall is shaping up to be really bad - but it's not completely locked in yet, weather pattern reversals and various other miracles could still happen - just something to keep in the back of your head when making plays.", "id": "usfwhj", "created_utc": 1652888779.0, "score": 96, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 50, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|19|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|217|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/opydwu/38_million_puts_how_all_of_wall_street_is_using/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mqe5mt/betting_on_oil_gas_and_economic_growth/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ok7hsx/update_on_market_crashing_soon_positions_and_an/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/tcqov5/this_is_how_the_financial_world_ends/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6jcq/a_follow_up_to_my_market_crash_post_specifically/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/og6ofy/housing_a_big_bubbly_pile_of_garbage_that_will/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/usfwhj/quick_macro_overview_the_fed_is_lying_to_you/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uflx06/the_2022_real_estate_collapse_is_going_to_be/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/salggk/behold_your_new_god_manbearape_the_vice_president/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q03iro/were_all_fucked_the_gay_bear_porn_you_need_for/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=usfwhj)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=usfwhj)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "The whole thing screams cash, yet you are in gme.
