I don't want to disclose where I work but the pay is also \"decent\". At least through my conversation during the interview, and my friend's experiences at Fb, I don't like the company.\n\nOn the business side, most employees and manger only care about short-term performance on metrics and don't care about the quality of the growth. For example, DAU is an important user, so they stress so much about it during the earnings call and interviews. The source of DAU growth can vary. If you have a successful marketplace or more groups where people discuss their hobbies, DAU will grow. On the other hand, you can keep feeding controversial/fake news to people's news feeds and push controversial comments to the top. People will want to argue with each other. In this case, DAU will also grow in short term. However, people may leave the platform, because the environment is so toxic. I am not saying this is true, but it's certainly something up for debate. At least, the company should be candid about what kind of growth they want. However, no one seems to care.  Nobody seems to care how about long-term plans. As long as xxx metrics grow within 6 months and I got my promotion, I don't care about anything else. An interesting thing is that in Fb's interview prep videos, they pretty much want you to start every answer with \"The mission at Fb is to connect people\" and zoom in, but in the actual answer, the big picture is simply irrelevant.\n\nOn the employee side, work-life balance can be horrible. To be fair, wlb is heavily team dependent and it's true in the industry. My friend is on the core ads team and she has no life. She works overtime every day and every weekend. Her team leader often chats with her at 11 pm. Everyone on her team still works at 11:00 pm. The part which puzzles me is that a lot of their works aren't necessary. They just want to do something to show the \"impact\" of their team. So they are literally creating works that don't exist and don't help the business. To me, their performance reviewing process is to blame, because it stresses so much, again, on impact. This is a good thing when Fb was in its infancy and growing fast. Naturally, there were a lot of meaningful projects to do and the impact-driven culture encourages people to move fast and work hard. However, now Fb is an established company, and there aren't as many new works as they used to be. So people have to find something to do FAST regardless of whether it helps the business or not. This also creates a weird situation. On one hand, the company is having a hiring freeze because the high-level management believes that there are too many employees. On the other hand, you have teams dying for people to join them to work on the projects they invented to show off their impact.\n\nThese are the reasons I don't like Fb as a company and I don't own its share. Sure, you can say I am sour on Fb, because I didn't pass the interview. However, I am rejected by companies more than I can remember and yet I am still a happy share holder of a lot of them.\n\nEdit:  Just want to add that the culture and the performance evaluation process at Fb make employees feel like people from different teams are competing with each other rather than collaborating. Someone may like it, but definitely not me.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}

The metric calculates how much employers pay workers in salary and benefits per unit of output.\n\nWall Street already had been looking for a 5.2% drop in productivity and an increase of 10.5% in unit labor costs. On a four-quarter basis, productivity fell 0.6%, the biggest decline since the fourth quarter of 1993.\n\nTaken together, the numbers underline the inflation surge in the U.S., which has seen prices rise at the fastest level in more than 40 years. Federal Reserve officials on Wednesday announced they would be raising interest rates half a percentage point as part of an ongoing effort to control inflation.\n\nA separate Labor Department report Thursday showed that jobless claims increased to 200,000 for the week ended April 30, a 19,000 gain from the previous period and above the Dow Jones estimate for 182,000.\n\nContinuing claims, which run a week behind the headline number, fell 19,000 to 1.38 million, the lowest level since Jan. 17, 1970.\n\nThe productivity data reflect a quarter in which a variety of factors converged to cause a 1.4% decline in the rate of economic growth as measured by gross domestic product.\n\nRising Covid cases, runaway inflation and the Russian invasion of Ukraine dented activity, though most economists expect growth to resume later in the year.

Actually I have no fucking clue cause I'm rich AF but for these meetings I have to pretend like I know so that the SPY can go uppy.\"\n\nYou thought that if you cannot even afford to drive to work then the economy is headed for recession. You spent $150 on puts that FOMC day only to have them expire worthless. Damn that was two days worth of gas money. \n\nFast forward to 2029. The SPY has increased to 5 million pesos.

Better to have the inflation appreciate the asset, as well as monetary storage. \n\nIt all sounds bad, but hey it could be worse.

Trillions of dollars rests upon their judgement. This is arguably the most important work in the world. You don't get in that position unless you're an incredibly esteemed economist. To think they're all idiots is absurd. Yes they still get things wrong because the future is unpredictable. I will trust them over some random WSB user.\n\nNot the \"they changed the calculations\" argument again. No they did not change it to lower inflation numbers. They changed it to better reflect *consumption* because that's what the *consumer* price index is measuring. They changed housing cost from the price of a home to the price of a mortgage payment or equivalent rent. Because real estate is not something that's consumed, it's an asset. You're not buying a house every month, you're paying a mortgage or rent.\n\nYes, everyday items, that's what CPI and PCE measure. Price changes are not uniform over all items. That's why your groceries can go up 20% but if something else went up less or went down then CPI is lower than 20%. CPI is explicitly created to track the average price change of a basket of everyday consumer goods and services.\n\nI don't mean to post a wall of text but unfortunately things are much more complex than WSB makes it out to be. It's a lot easier to say \"CPI is fake because groceries.. they changed the calculations\" than it is to go to the BLS website and see for yourself exactly how everything is calculated, what goods and services are measured, how each has changed in price, how the data is sourced, etc. Every bank in the world depends on this data, and many third party measures exist to verify that the data is correct.
