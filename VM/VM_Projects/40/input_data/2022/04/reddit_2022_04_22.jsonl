On price to trailing earnings, sales, cash flow, and tangible book value, FB is selling at less than HALF its 5-year averages, and is approaching its cheapest valuation since it started public trading with its 2012 IPO!!! \n\n1/3 of the WORLD population is a DAU. No one comes close to this, not Prime members, Netflix users, Snap users, Apple products in use, etc. The online ad business isn’t going anywhere and will be the bread & butter as they expand their offerings. \n\nOculus Quest 2 is a very favorable product with the VR community. I expect VR headsets in most US middle class households by 2025. From exercise to gaming to connecting with ppl across the world, VR is only getting started. Somewhat inappropriate but VR porn is also growing rapidly. VR and the Metaverse will only get bigger. \n\n$184 is a steal of a deal for this company. If they had the ticker INSTA or WTSAP, they’d probably be valued significantly higher lol.
