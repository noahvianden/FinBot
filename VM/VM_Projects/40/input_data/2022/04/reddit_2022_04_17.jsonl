{"title": "Market Multiples and Valuations - The S&P 500 is overpriced.", "selftext": "Last week, I had posted that high inflation and higher interest rates would cause stocks to fall and had suggested [taking profits in stocks such as NVDA to buy back 20% lower.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u0uymd/nvda_take_profits_and_buy_back_at_180/) Now NVIDIA is pretty much a family jewel and selling some our holdings meant that I really foresaw a weak 2022 for the markets - **even with the S&P down 8% from its all time high of 4,766 in Dec 2021!**\n\nWhy do I think the S&P will fall further? \n\nI don't believe the markets are fully pricing in  \n\n1. A 2.75% 10 year treasury rate and climbing - mortgage rates crossed 5%, that will hurt housing, one of the strongest spots in the economy.\n2. 8% Y0Y inflation - many are divided, some think that's the peak, many portend that it could well increase further.  I believe that a still very sluggish supply chain will continue to keep inflation elevated.\n3. Geo political shocks from the war in Ukraine.\n4. The Fed very much likely to increase interest rates in 1/2% bursts in 2022.\n5. A profit squeeze due to higher costs, which will slow down earnings growth in 2022 and 2023 - this is very unlikely not priced in S&P 500 earnings.\n\nThere is an interesting S&P 500 earnings forecast from Yardeni research - here's the link [https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yriearningsforecast.pdf](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yriearningsforecast.pdf)\n\nThe market consensus for S&P 500 earnings are around 227 and Yardeni's is higher at 240.\n\nAt Thursday's S&P 500's close of 4,392 the 2022 PE is 18.3 for Yardeni's earnings and 19.5 for analysts'  If you see the chart in figure 5, between 2007 and 2015, the PE ratio stayed below 15 most of the time and rarely rose above it. Between 2015 and pre covid March 2020, the PE ranged between 16 and 19, with a one massive drop to 13.5, mainly caused by the taper tantrum of late 2018 - when Fed chair, J Powell suggested he would start tapering and the markets took him to the woodshed.  Post Covid, PE's were significantly higher for two reasons, lower earnings and **an extra ordinary low interest rate and high fiscal stimulus environment.** \n\n**Both have reversed in spades and the S&P is down only 8% ? And the forward PE is closer to 19, still at its high end of the range!**\n\nBulls would argue that earnings have grown significantly, therefore higher PE's are justified. Sure they have but from lower Covid levels and a historically elevated profitable period due to huge stimulus and catching up of demand  --- which is highly unlikely to continue. Consensus earnings for the S&P 500 are calling for 10% growth in 2023 from 227 to 250, still above historical growth rates of 5.7% from 2009 to 2019. But, higher inflation reduces demand from consumers, which reduces earnings and higher interest rates reduce earnings multiples - **a double whammy.** \n\nI would not buy anything till the S&P corrects to at least 4,000, another 9-10% fall from these levels.\n\n**2022-2023 are the years to play defense -  hunker down and preserve capital.

So what? 5% isn't even high. If we ignore the mortgage rates in 2020 and 2021, 5% is among the lowest mortgage rates in history. 5% was the rate in 2019 pre-pandemic. Even 6% is not a bad rate when you consider historic rates.\n2. Okay. Not really as big of a deal as you and MSM are making it out to be, but if it hasn't peaked, it could be an issue. Actual inflation is not really a cause for concern because it's in the past. What's important is expected inflation. Do you think the general public is expecting inflation to continue at 8% per year? If the general public really believes this, then price stability is at risk, but if they don't believe this, it's a non-issue. The only way it becomes an issue is if inflation continues and public perception is that prices will continue to increase perpetually.\n3. Again, MSM has blown this out of proportion a little. It still could have global impacts over the next few months, but based on Russia's performance so far, I think there is reason to be optimistic. More importantly, I expect impact on equities to be minimal in the long term.\n4. So what? That's called a healthy economy.\n5. Market effects would be minimal and would only affect growth stocks if at all. Out of all your concerns, this is probably the most ridiculous. We may see more shareholder dilutions in unprofitable companies, but would be basically impossible to have a noticeable impact on ETFs and overall market valuations.\n\nI appreciate that you appear to have done some in-depth DD, but it's obvious that you're just parroting concerns of MSM as none of your conclusions are really based off an understanding of traditional or modern economic foundations.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "\n>1.

Even 6% is not a bad rate when you consider historic rates.\n\nTrue... historically, 5% or even 6% is very low however the average price of homes are significantly higher and going higher than what they were 20 to 30 to 40 years ago so monthly payments will be significantly higher impacting the affordability of middle class buyers. \n\nA 300k house with a 30 yr fixed \n\nat 3.5% rate would have a monthly cost of ~$1300\n\nat 5% rate would have a monthly cost of ~$1600\n\nat 6% rate would have a monthly cost of ~$1800\n\nThese are monthly commitments without including property taxes & insurance\n\nMy middle class in-laws were paying a 12% interest on a house in the early 80s however the four bedroom house cost them 75k at the time.

Checks out.\n\nI think another thing causing economic fears in the general population is they are getting stuck on is this belief that home prices should always go up. I think over the next few months and several years home prices are going to come down while equities go up. Anyone who bought real estate in the last 6-12 months is going to have to wait a very long time if they want to break even. In fact, I would also argue that technology will continue to reduce labor and material costs over time; so people buying at the peak now are going to see a long, possibly 10+ year period of slow value depreciation. Over the next 5 years, home prices are going to slowly decrease, followed by a period of returning to growth for another 5 years and by year 10, most homes will sell for roughly the same price they are going for now adjusted for inflation, but by that time, homes will begin to decrease in value yet again, due to even more rapidly evolving technology.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "AGREE..", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "RemindME! 10 years \":D\"", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 10 years on [**2032-04-17 23:09:52 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2032-04-17%2023:09:52%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/u5tn5b/market_multiples_and_valuations_the_sp_500_is/i553p4m/?context=3)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fstocks%2Fcomments%2Fu5tn5b%2Fmarket_multiples_and_valuations_the_sp_500_is%2Fi553p4m%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202032-04-17%2023%3A09%3A52%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20u5tn5b)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "But  the main issue is the affordability of monthly payments that comes from paying approx 20% to 30% more from a 3.5% 30 yr fixed rate to a 5% to 6% 30 yr mortgage.
