{"title": "(WSJ) Elon Musk Sells $8.5 Billion of Tesla Shares After Deal to Buy Twitter. The Tesla chief executive reported selling a total of more than 9.6 million shares Tuesday through Thursday.", "selftext": "[https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-sells-billions-of-dollars-in-tesla-stock-11651197227?mod=hp\\_lead\\_pos1](https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-sells-billions-of-dollars-in-tesla-stock-11651197227?mod=hp_lead_pos1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nElon Musk sold roughly $8.5 billion worth of Tesla Inc. TSLA 2.69%▲ stock in the three days after agreeing to buy Twitter Inc. TWTR 0.81%▲ for $44 billion, according to regulatory filings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Tesla chief executive reported selling a total of more than 9.6 million shares on Tuesday through Thursday, at prices between around $820 and $1,000 a share, the filings show.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat left him with around 163 million shares in the electric-vehicle maker, regulatory filings show, or nearly 16% of the company. Mr. Musk is Tesla’s largest shareholder and owned around 17% of the company before this week’s sales, according to FactSet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMr. Musk tweeted Thursday: “No further TSLA sales planned after today.”\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Tesla boss was for many years reluctant to part with Tesla stock, but he is on the hook to come up with $21 billion in cash to finance the Twitter deal. That funding plan also includes borrowing $12.5 billion from loans backed by more than $62.5 billion worth of Tesla shares that he owns.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMr. Musk’s stock sales don’t paint a definite picture of how close he is to putting together the cash he would need to close the Twitter deal. He’s sold roughly $25 billion worth of Tesla stock since the beginning of November.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOver half of the more than $16 billion worth of stock Mr. Musk sold in 2021 was earmarked to pay taxes. He exercised more than 22 million vested stock options before they would have expired this year; that exercise was a taxable event, and he sold shares to pay those obligations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt’s possible Mr. Musk owes relatively little tax on the shares he’s sold this week. That’s because he could be selling shares he got by exercising options last year when Tesla’s stock price was higher. Taxpayers are allowed to use capital losses to offset capital gains. The SEC filings don’t disclose the cost basis of the shares that Mr. Musk was selling, so his gains and losses can’t be estimated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTesla shares rose more than 4% in Friday trading.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMr. Musk had a net worth of $252 billion as of Thursday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, making him the world’s richest person. But much of his wealth is tied up in his companies, which include Tesla and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX. Mr. Musk, who is compensated in stock awards and doesn’t accept a cash salary from Tesla, at times has described himself as cash poor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs of last year, more than half of Mr. Musk’s Tesla stock—or roughly 88 million shares—was pledged as collateral to secure personal debt, an August regulatory filing shows.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSelling stock could weaken Mr. Musk’s control over Tesla. Companies such as Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and Google parent Alphabet Inc. have multiple classes of shares, giving founders supervoting power over common shareholders. Tesla lacks such a structure.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition to the shares he owns, Mr. Musk has tens of millions of vested Tesla stock options. He is in line to receive billions of dollars worth of additional stock options after the electric-vehicle maker reported record quarterly earnings earlier this month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThose payouts are part of a massive 2018 pay package that rewards Mr. Musk when Tesla hits certain performance metrics.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShares in Tesla, the world’s largest car maker by value, were down roughly 20% from the last trading day before Mr. Musk disclosed his Twitter stake through Monday, the day before his latest selling spree.", "id": "uerc5l", "created_utc": 1651254214.0, "score": 100, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 40, "comments": [{"body": "Selling Tesla to Buy Twitter, it is his money and he can do whatever he wants BUT it’s like selling the family cow for a few magic beans.", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "Except that he has many, many, many more fattened calves.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "How many more shares can Elon unlock with his compensation plan?\n\nIn any case I suspect a new plan will be put up to vote for shareholders along with the new shares issuance for the stock split.
