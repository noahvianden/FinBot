While such an outcome is not certain, this is currently the direction that the world was headed, it added.\n\nIts warnings come as investors try to assess the economic damage likely to be felt from a rapid series of large interest rate increases in the US and elsewhere, as central bankers race to try to curb soaring inflation.\n\nThe S&P has dropped 20 per cent since its peak at the start of this year, while the Nasdaq is down by one-third since its high a year ago.\n\nHowever, Elliott said markets had not fallen far enough, given the many risks present, and warned of a further reversal of the so-called ‘everything rally’ seen near the top of the bull market of recent years, as sky-high investor exuberance lifted all manner of risky assets.\n\nThere are so many “frightening and seriously negative possibilities” that it is hard not to think that “a seriously adverse unwind of the everything bubble” is coming, it said.\n\nThe hedge fund estimates a 50 per cent fall from peak to trough would be “normal”, suggesting further large falls to come in major equity markets, although it added it was impossible to know whether or when that would happen.\n\nElliott, which is up 6.4 per cent in 2022 and which has only lost money in two calendar years since launch in 1977, pointed to a handful of areas of potential stress that could accelerate market falls. It highlighted banks’ losses on bridge financing, potential markdowns of collateralised loan obligations and leveraged private equity as areas of potential risk for markets.\n\nThe firm was also critical of investors who believed market falls will always prove shortlived and can be “ignored”.\n\nThe idea that “‘we will not panic because we have seen this before’ does not comport with the current facts”, it said.", "id": "ylhggj", "created_utc": 1667515992.0, "score": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 42, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|141|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|752|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ylhggj)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ylhggj)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "He’s got puts", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Nah he’s got calls.
