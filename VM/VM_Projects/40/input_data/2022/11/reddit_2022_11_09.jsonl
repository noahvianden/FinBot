{"title": "11-9-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Well it is the night before CPI we are about to be reminded just how bad inflation is and that there is no end in sight… even the best case scenario reading of 8.0% still is awful and no where near the 2% goal… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p3p3o5ouvzy91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ab7689530bb557aef5035d3c01549d12acad2c8\n\nHere is my forecast based on historical CPI data and analysis. There is a chance based on Cleveland fed all miss besides CPI Yoy though. It will be a very spicy open. But something interesting to keep in mind is that this is the reddest pre-CPI day we have had since June. And for those of you who remember pretty much before July we used to get an almost standard and expected 2% intraday sell off on SPY the day before CPI… it appears we just started that trend again. Tomorrow will be interesting to watch. \n\nWill keep todays TA brief as we will have a massive move either way and the dust will settle and we can decide where we could be headed next. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zga5b13vvzy91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=96386cc3861d45a5883f81dc7af19dd9471bd9f4\n\nWe did break through that 378 key level support which has held up and we also broke through the rising wedge on the daily that we have been trading within since the last CPI. Based on my calculations bull case puts SPY somewhere between 385.3 to 389.1 tomorrow and bear case puts us near 362.9 to 359.2. \n\nKey daily supports around this range is 365 -> 360 \n\nKey daily resistance around this range is 384 -> 388.6\n\nRegardless of what reading is we are about to see the next big move and direction for markets. If CPI beats and JPOW truly can say next meeting that “inflation has slowed” and “we see reason finally to slow rate hikes” then we are going to see a push toward 400-420 by next CPI and FOMC (December 12/13th). However, if CPI misses (especially core and or MoM) then what JPOW said about not having inflation tamed and that it is pre-mature to even consider slowing hikes right now is about to be sang on every new outlet. If we miss I think we head down towards 320-340 before the next CPI/ FOMC in December. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mcbz10qvvzy91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d7cc708ed29d489368ea2e73ca47f6f331b02d8\n\nFutes actually is still holding its rising wedge right now. Seeing a case for 3750 support still holding as of now. \n\nSupports- 3750 -> 3675 -> -> 3590\n\nResistance- 3805 -> 3862 -> 3905\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zlse5g6wvzy91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8187ecaf22051b795561fca81b874d007bd12edc\n\nApple just closed below its last CPI candle body low of 134.9. Today tech as a whole (besides meta) looked probably the worst it has looked In a very long time. This further tells me that a CPI miss is not price in and that tech especially will get absolutely slaughtered. \n\nLooking at previous CPIs 5-6% movement is possible on Apple that gives us a possible 127.8 to 126.5 tomorrow which would be a new 52 week low for Apple… actually Apple right here is 4.4% from its 52 week low at close of market today. This is the first close below 138.4 support level since June of this year. \n\nSupport- 129.9 -> 125.8\n\nResistance- 138.5 -> 140.4 -> 142.1\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3x6ajfowvzy91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=570f956559ad4bbf36c8d44e2839b2bd0372add5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/otmds15xvzy91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ff32221d68d1d778fc49cd43b859e28b67b9a31\n\nZoomed out on tesla is beyond ugly and I feel like this thing is just going to get driven down until it closes under $100/ share. Currently 172.2 support is the 2022 bear channel on Tesla if that level breaks then there is just the massive weekly bear channel left as you can see. This also potentially will be the first close under the weekly 200ema since October 2019. \n\nKey supports- 167.6 -> 150.9 -> 129.3\n\nKey resistance- 188.1 -> 204.8\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6zyf3pjyvzy91.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=3961b7faaa38c3e06be43c2e686de092c8835473\n\nThe VIX remains hella underwhelming putting in a mild 2.15% green day on the eve of CPI. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the VIX somewhere between 27 and 28.3 at open tomorrow and we could breach 30 if CPI misses that big. \n\nDaily log- \n\nHonestly I struggled today with the technical. A lot of oversold indicators then pushing $1-$2 through that level to then reverse then push further. I got stopped out a few times only for it to go green and I didn’t close green for it to reverse on me too. Overall ended green thanks to a few scalps but tough day for me. \n\nSee what tomorrow brings with CPI. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gchl8zzyvzy91.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=4de7d6a1114584a1586fecbf684f6a02ce142cbf\n\nYoutube will be up later!", "id": "yqwe59", "created_utc": 1668029989.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 48, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|10|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|3578|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vwhw7o/how_to_trade_cpi_day/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v8vbnd/6922_spy_daily_ta_bonus_cpi_day_trade_breakdown/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xsd18z/93022_spy_es_futures_apple_and_tesla_weekly_recap/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5xtr/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uxvyrg/52522_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwdk8h/52322_spy_daily_ta_bonus_fomc_minutes_reaction_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/w5k3q1/the_only_fomc_week_ta_dd_youll_ever_need_to_read/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vxkm5u/71222_spy_es_futures_daily_ta_and_cpi_swing_play/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/usqmwy/51822_spy_daily_ta/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=yqwe59)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=yqwe59)\n    \nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.\n>TL;DR: Going to be a very spicy open tomorrow.
