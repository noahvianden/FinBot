And it takes time, it's not going to get under 2% this year. It's not going to be a touch and go recession either. Companies have contagion. There's too much debt laying around that simply cannot be processed at such high interest rates. Maybe FED will not raise. But if they don't cut in the next 6 months, many companies will go bankrupt simply at these interest levels. Credit card debt is rising really fast.

It's about how much time will rates be at these levels. The longer the time , the tighter the hold of recession around the economy.

What Quantitative Easing is, is just the Fed turning that into overdrive. \n\nQuantitative tightening is the opposite of that. It is the Fed locking up the money again and taking it out of circulation. It still exists, just as it always has.

Sudden tightening by Fed just looks to me as a cheap stopgap solution that exacerbates the inherent problrm, tobmake numbers prettier for their so-called model devised by disconnected phd economists. If they couldnt see a huge headline inflation pressure (sure russian invasion did make it worse but it was on a rise), how audacious is of them to be so certain that they will have target long term inflation of 2%, when they are wrong time after time?

Market does not predict the future but i believe it is the best representation of the current status as it is not a one central entity like fed. It is an amalgamation of participants from worldwide making individual decisions, which should eventually form a smooth increasing yield curve.\n\nIm just no convinced that fed is doing what they are supposed to still. If they frontload the fund rate to 3.5% in next two meetings, how long are they gonna be able to keep it there? They had to ease back in jul 2019 only half year after the rate hike is completed.

We also failed to even hit the 30day volume average. Are bulls still exhausted? Is this a buying the rumor sell the news type of event? \n\nTomorrow will be pretty interesting to watch. We obviously saw weakness earlier this week and end of last week. However, its clear that people are still buying but now that we got the CPI news what is the next bullish catalyst to push us up? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wleu2e3s7yg91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e98a84f02d12badfe6ca263c5dc0139569100f3\n\nSPY has an impressive rising wedge forming on the daily (solid red lines). We rejected it perfectly today. I am surprised we did not break through this resistance today as this felt like an easy layup for the bulls to take spy to a 3% plus green day. \n\nNext major resistance I have is at 421.1 and then 423.7. \n\nOne key takeaway I have from today is that we did back test the daily 200ema and we are holding that support very well. I do favor that as a bullish omen for the markets. \n\nWe are seeing an impressive $3.97 gap on the daily though. We now have three pretty large daily gaps with two down near 370s and now this one in the 410s. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dmmxq3qs7yg91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a43305755af44e1c3c5f2c2ee2055dcd72f9e2ef\n\nSpy weekly is looking pretty bullish though. We have held the weekly 9 week long bull channel support and now we are looking to test this weekly rising wedge. Resistance for the weekly to watch is 423 and key support is now 415. \n\nIf we continue to trend like this I have little hesitation in saying that we touch the 430s next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xmhj7dct7yg91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1013900f7b2941c50e5caafcf0e0fac10b7c22d8\n\nES futures is in the same boat. Key resistance remains at 4223 for the rising wedge and then 4275 for the next rising wedge. \n\nSupport is now at 4184 the daily 200ema followed by 4140. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hkuao6yt7yg91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4899599e98b6cb8605ca97329dd67c52d4f2f56\n\nFutures weekly never did confirm the bull support however we are not trending over that weekly resistance level of 4163. A close over that and I do suspect that we see 4300s next week. \n\nRising wedge resistance is 4232 and support is that 4163 level tomorrow. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yoeyoeku7yg91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebf8a53de06faaae4ad702c0cd8cb90ffae5cd57\n\nApples like that gold fish that no matter how neglected it is, how often you feed it, how often you don’t change the water, or how often the cat tries to eat it… that mofo just don’t quit. \n\nApple broke through the rising wedge (this is the one that spy/ es rejected today… omen for tomorrow? Most likely) and closed over the support level of 168.9. \n\nFrom here apple is on a mission to test the bear market resistance level of 173-174.5 depending on how quickly we get there. We now have two MASSIVE gaps on the Apple daily. We have a $1.86 gap from July 29th and then todays $1.08 gap. When will we fill these gaps? This week? Next week? 2023? Who knows at this point… Apple on a mission for green and I hesitate to bet against that. \n\nKey resistances- 171.8 -> 172.8\n\nKey support- 168.9 -> 166.5 -> 164.9\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/95lc5i6v7yg91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=902b4257d02803cdaf1ad71b9039f734c801f333\n\nThe VIX has just continued to go lower and lower and lower. I am a little impressed that it bounced directly off my falling wedge support line though and that it didn’t dump into the 18s today. However, the VIX is on an almost 9 week long unwind. \n\nInterestingly enough the bounce today is at the median high level that the VIX spent most of its time at in 2021. The low end is closer to 15.5. If we continue to see the VIX unwind we are going to be looking at a new possible range of 15.5 to 19.75. \n\nHistorically I would say most of 2022 has been spent between 18.6 and 25.5 or 25.5 and 34.7. I would even venture to say that most of 2022 has been spent well over 25.5…. Is there a reversion to mean expected here? Do we short term revert or do we long term revert? \n\n10% challenge-\n\nOverall today and really this week has been a great week for me. I was swinging that Apple put that I averaged down yesterday. I did attempt to close it EOD yesterday but it didn’t fill missed it by about 10 cents… I was already down over 50% at EOD yesterday. I was able to closer it at open before the IV crush for -84.3%. Overall im still at 1.5x weekly profits with that loss. \n\nI am continuing to capitalize on quick scalps using the 1min/ 5min HA candles with STOCH and VOLD/VOLSPD 1min HA candles. The 20/50emas here have been gold for me. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r4rprh1w7yg91.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc5d4a6ac354ff3ab23eb5e50de0ddae975a9e8f\n\nAim small miss small. I am currently 9 for 9 on plays this week and my only red play is that swing play that I opened last week. Overall its been a great week. \n\nToday was a tough one to trade because we had such extreme bull momentum, however, the candles were moving at snail pace all day. Going to be interesting to see what tomorrow brings. \n\nOn one hand this feels like the bulls are exhausted and gives me May FOMC vibes where she dumped like a mofo the next day and on the other hand this felt like a premarket run followed by consolidation all day. EOD I saw some crazy buying coming in on VOLSPD and VOLD. Very organized and consistent buying, however, SPY barely budged and even sold off at the end… I wonder if we just saw a ton of shorts cover EOD. \n\nRemember in this market guys we don’t need to go for homeruns. We don’t need to play every single candle. A 10% win that you let turn into a -20% loser is actually a 30% loser… Be smart out here. \n\nYoutube video be up later tonight", "id": "wl8dvu", "created_utc": 1660164517.0, "score": 33,

Just adds more to my thoughts that this bear market will be long and brutal with this kind of behavior. \n\n\nTake a look at the below chart, think it's very interesting. Looking at bear market rallies in terms of drawdown retracements (after the initial 20% decline), shows that it's uncommon to retrace more than 50% of the decline and then go back down to new lows. None since WWII, but 60%, 80%, and 90% retacements in the 1930s bear markets (the most brutal bear market in history)\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/FZ0Ai6lWYAANgXd?format=jpg&name=4096x4096\n\nShows how 420 is an absolute landmark here.

Equities completely unchanged. I also remember the last few weeks how the treasury market completely did a 180 after the fed jawboned pushing back against a pivot, but once again, stocks unchanged. \n\nThe stock market is completely detached from all reality at this point, detached from fundamentals and the bond market. China could invade Taiwan and this shit could pump to 500 it seems.\n\nAll I know is that ALWAYS the stock market ponzi scheme comes back to the fundamentals and snaps back to reality at some point.
