{"title": "I have trouble getting a clear picture of a company and its prospects", "selftext": "In 2015 I was somewhat aware that AMD was making a comeback but I figured I didn't really know anything about how processors were made. Since the time I was looking at it it's gone from a few dollars to over one hundred dollars.  \n\nIn 2016 I was aware Nvidia's cards were used for crypto mining and machine learning in addition to being the best graphics cards. I figured I didn't know what advantage they had over AMD, Intel, ASICs, and cloud services for machine learning. The new version of anything in technology is usually cheaper and better, so why shouldn't another company come eat their lunch? I would deserve to lose money in something I didn't understand.   \n\nWhen Tesla made the first Model S I went into a newly opened Tesla showroom and asked the employee about any cons the car had. The stock was probably a thousand times cheaper than it is now.  \nI just figured I didn't know anything about cost to make a car vs the profit and that the auto industry was a terrible place to invest.  \n\nApple during the time of the release of the iPhone and iPad. Surely it can't go much higher. The company is already hyped and just about the most valuable company in the world. How much bigger can the company get? Today it's at least a ten times return since the iPad came out.  \n\nOn and on. Bitcoin was ten dollars when I first heard about it. It went to one hundred and I figured that was the top of the pump. Bitcoin was promoted so much by the criminal financial press I figured it was just another one of their schemes. I didn't look at the inner workings. I had already seen them pump and dump Dot Com stocks and the housing market derivatives.  \n\nNow, I would have kept my money parked in all of these companies if I had more than I knew what to do with. In the past five years I've been nearly broke twice. If I had more conviction about the stocks I would have fought harder to stay in them.  \n**I guess I'm asking how I can get a closer look at a security and get a firmer 'yes' or 'no'.**  These are the companies I felt strongest about and I don't get bullish about stocks like Groupon.\nI don't do a deep dive on companies because I'm not really sure how. I kind of fear if I did look deeply at a company I would just bias myself in favor of it. Also, I'm skittish about putting money in a company I don't fully understand.  \nAnd, we used to have Bear Markets that would last four years. In the early and mid 2010s it felt like we were due for a long bear market to start. It's all been going up and up for so long you think you don't want to put money in and watch it slowly go down. I know five years and ten years are when you get 10x or 100x returns, but I don't have time for this. I'm aware of the stock every day and six months or two years of the stock doing nothing is like an eternity.

For most of the early 2010s, most consumer software only utilized one core unless it was highly optimized (e.g. video editing), so Intel was king. In 2012, AMD was producing processors with 8-12 (or more) cores when Intel i7s were topping out at 4. I got lucky here and guessed that more cores are better, and that temperature doesn't matter. As it turns out, software has come a long way in the past 5 years, and AMDs bet in high thread counts has paid off. It's still also the case that AMD CPUs run at a higher TDP than Intel. It turns out that consumers don't care if their CPUs generate slightly higher temps; it also turns out that consumers would rather pay less and have more cores than pay more for lower temps and slightly faster clock speed.\n\nFull disclosure: I bet on AMD's success in 2016-2017 and recently sold my position in favor of buying VOO.

Additionally, Elon does not consider the car the product but the factory the product. Tesla is iterating on its factories the way they iterate on software. Any new place that gets major Tesla production, will get the next evolution of the factory. Segmenting it to appease some arbitrary legacy auto standard is ridiculous and should be shamed.\n\nAll that said, this doesn't change the calculus. India needs Tesla. Tesla doesn't need India.

It's not what I want, it's what Tesla wants. The company as a whole has reached a point where it considers the factory to be the real product. The introduction of the Tesla Bot is in essence an extension of the factory. FSD and general purpose vision solutions engineering, is again an extension of this. Only by iterating on the factory can they then reap the benefits of the economics of scale. Segmenting manufacturing to satisfy a government that wants a modern auto footprint while maintaining the legacy procedural paradigm isn't going to work, because these modern autos will then clash with that tangled weave of rules and regulations that have created this mess in the first place.\n\nMost importantly, the leader of Tesla is not only genre savvy, he's also extremely smart and thinks far ahead of everyone else. Others may be willing to compromise to get in on the market today, to then turn large profits tomorrow; but thus far, he's been pretty against the idea of compromising on vision for some money, and splitting the factory this way is a compromise of that vision to make money.\n\nRegarding India, the anti-china sentiment is basically racism/pride issue. They're letting that get in the way of what is good for their country. The grander irony is that unlike other autos, whose car factories are partially owned by Chinese companies. Tesla is the only factory in China that is wholly owned by Tesla. So other than it being geographically made elsewhere, there's no \"China\" in these Teslas in the way it's emotionally construed by the Indian government.\n\nThey need to put on their big boy pants instead of throwing a fit, and I say that as an Indian.
