{"title": "TQQQ why short-term only?", "selftext": "I have been watching TQQQ for years (3x leveraged) and I realized that is the perfect ETF to buy when market is on the bottom. I have been holding it for some time and I experienced huge gains and big drop. What I find interesting with TQQQ is that many investing websites say TQQQ should not be long term hold and that it is most suitable for 1 day. Now I don't know if I am dumb or what.... but I can see that if you have big drop in market, it make sense to buy TQQQ because on the way up you will get rich. Of course that wouldn't work if market would keep dropping for years but history shows us that is not the case.\n\nMy question to you is: Why do you think you shouldn't buy it right now? (I am adding to TQQQ positions) because 3x will be easy once bull market starts.", "id": "zdixju", "created_utc": 1670272846.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.62, "num_comments": 44, "comments": [{"body": "It's 3\\* the daily returns, not 3\\* the total.\n\nSo picture a time period where you have a choppy market, and it goes 100, 99, 100, 99, 100, 99, 100, 99, 100, 99, 100, 99, 100.\n\nIn the 3\\* fund, you end up with $99.63 on every $100 invested, even though the underlying is even.
