I don't plan to to trade the below just used it as an example, lets pretend JPOW and CPI don't exist for this post and focus on the odds and expected return calculation.\\*\\*\\*\n\nI have a card counting background and play with an average 1-2% edge over casino. The expected return for a Blackjack trip is Hands Played \\* Average Bet Size = Volume At-Risk; Volume At-Risk \\* Edge = Expected Trip Profit. There are also formulas (Ex. Kelly Bet Criterion) to minimize your risk of ruin (ie. Blowing up Account) while maximizing your bet size to optimally grow your bankroll.\n\nIs it appropriate to consider the potential profit and bet sizing from selling defined risk options while profiting from their decay in a manner similar to how one sizes E(r) and Risk of Ruin for a trip?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Example: SPX IC 12\\/13\\/22](https://preview.redd.it/a7nwpmxja75a1.jpg?width=586&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a2b1389ef1ad18720c2e145f00276e06b4d5dc09)\n\nIf the above 12/13/22 SPX IC were the odds of a blackjack hand I would consider the E(r) as follows; assuming binary outcomes (Max gain or Max Loss) while holding to expiration:\n\n* Expected Profit per trial is $3,715\n* Expected Loss per trial is -$3,035\n* Expected Return per trial is $680 or 11.2% on Risk\n\nSince there is a positive expected return, all else equal (I know market conditions change) if this IC was sold multiple times one may end up with an \\~11.2% return on at-risk volume at the end of the year which seems realistic on its face.", "id": "zifsk3", "created_utc": 1670734956.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 42, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, regarding the continuous shuffling machine you can’t beat it counting since it is designed to turn every hand into an independent trail. Counting only works when the hands are dependent trials (ex. Three aces were dealt so I know there’s only one left the shoe). The difference is that in BJ playing against a CSM the E(r) is always negative to the player since you start out at -.5% disadvantage to the house on ever new shoe.\n\nRisk defined options caught my eye because although the stock market is a random walk you can originate positive expected return bets on like the example above. Then it just comes down to volume.\n\nBlack swan events will increase the variance of your bankroll ( it will bounce around a lot more on it’s random drift upwards), which I thought to hedge with proper bet sizing when originating the option trades. If the trades are smaller relative to your at risk capital it will help protect against getting whacked when Jpow gets crabs on Sukumvit Soi 5 in Bangkok.\n\nAs you bankroll grows so does your bet size, and gets smaller as bank roll shrinks.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Cool, thanks for the helpful reply I was a little surprised most didn’t read the post before responding too.\n\nAlso on the black swan events, if one is a net seller of premium shouldn’t those episodes help by making premiums more expensive for buyers, thereby increasing bankroll variance but also putting more coin in sellers’ pockets?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Just to give you an idea, the first big day of the Covid drop when SPX dropped about 3.6x outside of it’s 10-day average absolute range, was on 2/24/20, and volatility increased for another 15 trading days until it peaked on 3/16/20.\n\nHowever, it’s interesting, we’re sort of in new territory with daily expirations. Just a few years ago you only had weekly expirations, and while you could open a new IC (for instance) on any given day to capture newly generated IV, you were still limited as for your selection for DTE, and hence would have had to suffer the risk of further volatility increases in that period, or just forgo the trade due to uncertainty. But now!! You can choose any DTE you’d like!\n\nSo, for instance, say you open a 2-DTE IC every two days. If we look at that same period in two-day bars, there’s 9 bars, and only 3 of those had higher absolute percent changes than the previous bars, meaning there’s a good chance you could have collecting the increasing premium the other 6 bars (as you speculated (if everyday expirations existed back then, which they didn’t yet (but that’s besides the point))).\n\nFood for thought!", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "I’m thinking 0DTE IB and IC, for this blackjack-esque strategy where I’m place one IC per day and holding to expiration.
