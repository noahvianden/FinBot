So much greed, and from people that have nothing to do with tech.\n\nWe are firmly in the information age, all the 'value' stocks, they are too predictable, may as well invest in an index fund. People love those growth stocks. They will start to look super undervalued about halfway through 2023. \n\nSeeing articles now talking about stocks like Microsoft, Amazon, and esp cyber stocks like ZScaler - saying they are doing good business, high potential for continued growth, but are considered 'overvalued due to fundamentals'\n\nSince when did the market care about fundamentals lol. Only when fear overtakes greed. Halfway through next year those stocks, some of which are down 1/2 from peak already, will rally hard as people get greed FOMO. They're in the bargain bin now. It's not like Microsoft or Amazon are going anywhere. Meta is toast, twitter is toast, as you say consolidation of the crap, but heaps of strong players are looking like good buys long-term right now..
