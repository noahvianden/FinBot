{"title": "Beware Hidden Leverage.", "selftext": "A lot of people here don't use borrowed money to invest, but simply pick the stocks you invest in. This sounds safe, but in fact you may be getting a return akin to using leverage without realizing it. The fact is a lot of the most popular stocks have borrowed heavily to expand their operations. You may think that all stocks entail equal risk, but clearly that is not so.\n\nAn excellent example of this is ARK Invest. They invest almost exclusively in \"disruptive technology.\" That is new firms with new products to bring to market. What does that mean? ALL HAVE LOTS OF DEBT. Ergo some do well and expand quickly, others don't and default. This is why ARK Invest products seem to have returns akin to a leveraged S&P fund, but not the day to day volatility. Part of the reason for the lack of volatility is the amount of private equity ARK invested in and those don't have the instant valuation changes public firms do.\n\nWhat does this mean? Well, you may have two otherwise identical firms, except one borrows heavily to expand operations and the other doesn't. Ergo, the return of the one will behave like a leveraged investment into the other.\n\nI will ask you to look at what you're holding, examine their debt outstanding, and ask yourself how \"safe\" your investment style really is. Some of you here are using margin and options to gain leverage, and so you must factor that in to the true overall leverage. In the real world, Ford has a debt to income ratio of \\~1.5x, and Tesla has a debt to income ratio of \\~3.6x, ergo Tesla is more risky than Ford. And both companies make electric vehicles with Ford promising to go all electric in the coming years.\n\nTo the extent shares are not equal can be shown by how borrowing to invest in a safe stock may net more returns than an unlevered investment into risky stock. There's no guarantee of this, but the best returns are always the ones disproportionate to risks taken.\n\nYes, margin, corporate debt, naked options, student loans, mortgages, and all the rest of it is all just leverage. Some of these are normalized and expected, others are considered exotic and risky, but it's all the same thing.", "id": "zyoxp7", "created_utc": 1672368842.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "num_comments": 44, "comments": [{"body": "`| \"disruptive technology.\" That is new firms with new products to bring to market.

(a) They don't have a balance sheet to support it. (b) they can't service the debt, because they are growing so fast they can't even pay their employees, and (c) the return on equity is 10x the return on debt for tech. \n\nWhat ARK has is a portfolio of companies with no revenues and no EBITDA, but a fuck-ton of growth. The bet is that if the firms turn off the growth, they will be money pumps. Somewhere between 1-in-4 and 1-in-8 will be successful.

Whether you're burning chump VC money or the bank's money makes no difference, it's all leverage.\n\nAlso, you know the returns to early-stage VC and crowdfunding are identical, right? There's nothing magical happening in the enchanted forest.", "score": -15, "replies": [{"body": "I'm well aware of the difference between debt and equity, which is why I'm suggesting you aren't. \n\nYour statement is like saying \"It doesn't matter if you have a dollar or I have a dollar, it's still a dollar\". Technically true, and completely meaningless in the context of who's going to benefit from the dollar. \n\nLet's go over a few items:\n\n1) \"The only difference between debt and equity is who bears the risk\". Yeah, this just *wrong.* The differences between debt and equity are (a) the risk/return ratio. In an ideal world, these are equal for all investments, but that's impossible to achieve. If there's no balance sheet, debt has the same risk as equity and returns at (LIBOR - inflation) or if not LIBOR, whatever rate is being charged. Equity has unlimited upside, and massive risk, because it's completely unsecured and last in line for money when the hammer drops. Still, for a growth firm, since the risk is the same and the returns are better, equity is a far better investment (caveat - if it's valued properly). \n\n2) \"burning chump VC money or the bank's money makes no difference, it's all leverage.\"  This is only true from the perspective of the *investee*, not the investor. The bank is an investor. VCs are investors. They have different risk appetites, and access to completely different capital pools. Both are experts in what they do (presumably, to be sure there are a lot of 3rd tier VCs and a handful of 3rd tier lenders out there who are just dumb money). As an investor, if you think this way, start lending to risky startups. Or just light your money on fire. After all it's all the same, right? \n\n3) \"returns to early-stage VC and crowdfunding are identical\" There's a lot to unpack here. First, you need to define the VC market. If you include all private investment not on a crowdfunding platform, I would buy this. If you are only talking professionally/institutionally deployed capital by financial investors, you're way off. It's the inexpert individual investors that drive down VC returns.   If you really believe this, then why don't you just start a fund and invest in every crowd funded company? There are literally funds that do this, and they have shit returns on individual investments but do OK over the whole market. It just takes a fuck-ton of money. As an entrepreneur, these are the investors I would term \"Dumb Money\". And good luck to you as an individual getting even the returns that the dumb money funds get. \n\n4) \"There's nothing magical happening in the enchanted forest.\"  You're right, there's no magic, just discipline, hard work, experience, expertise, and, frankly, luck.  But just blithely shouting \"Debt has teh same risk as equity\" is a good way to go broke. I'd be more than happy to take your low interest loans and invest them in high-risk equity.

But in reality, capital structure  will be either 100% equity or a mixture of debt and equity. I cant recall situations where it is 100% debt capital structure. Even in bankruptcy, if successful with restructuring, debt becomes equity (existing shareholders lose out).

(BYD is beating Tesla in China.)  \n\nPay attention to the point of origin of the smear campaign. Almost all anti-Tesla press is out of Detroit and by those with close relationships (dependency) with Detroit. And its well timed. Read carefully - two Teslas in a crash and driver assist MUST be turned off - even if it was not in use. And how many ICE vehicles crashed that day?  Curious.\n\nWas Tesla overvalued - sure. Is it executing?  Yes. Does Elon need to drive day to day operations - he hasn't in years. They (Detroit) are at least a year behind having of a product that is parity. I saw a CNBC segment where \"Farmer Jim\" (unqualified) asks whether Tesla is a Car Company or a Tech Company.  That is how vintage the analyst (cough) thinking is. When Apple releases their car (likely next year) will old Farmer Jim ask the same question? Is Foxconn's vehicle from a Car or Tech company?  When GM made war planes was it a car or a aerospace company? Just nuts.  Did Tesla redefine the game and raise the bar - oh hell yeah. Without them we'd be talking 40MPG, still fighting EPA requirements and highlighting the number of cup holders.  On the plus side a good existential threat is healthy for stoic old guards in Capitalism. It gives the leadership indemnity in taking risks that they would not even conceive of taking.   You cannot get fired for responding to a threat.  Had Mary Barra gone whole hog EV she would have been shown the door and the UAW would be carrying effigies.  And therein lies the snail pace and retrofitting. The UAW (production) wants full employment, the brass (management) wants zero risk and continued stock vesting and Engineering waits for a chance to swing for the fence but is stuck between these two camps constraints.
