{"title": "Expected moves this week. SPY, QQQ, Amazon, Alphabet, Docusign, NIO and more.", "selftext": "### The Broader Markets\n\n**Last Week –** The market took a bit of a breather from volatility as SPY was lower by about 1.2%, less than the 2% options were pricing. The highs and lows intra-week were also in a much tighter range than the past few weeks.\n\n**This Week – SPY** options are pricing about a 2.1% move for the upcoming week (about $8.50 in either direction).\n\n**Implied Volatility / VIX –** The VIX closed the week near 25, down from 26 the prior week. IT is now at its lowest level since late April although still above historical averages. VIX futures are upward sloping with October above 28.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\n* SPY **2%** (+/- $8.50)\n* QQQ **2.8%** (+/- $9)\n* IWM **2.6%** (+/- $5)\n* DIA **1.7%** (+/- $5.50)\n\n### In the News\n\nAmazon stocks has a new look Monday following a 20 for 1 split. Options positions from Friday will be x20 contract-wise on strikes now divided by 20. New trades going forward will be using the new strikes. There’s no general rule for how a stock and its options trade following a split. Studies have shown some differences between small and large-cap stock volatility post-split. Many stocks will see a period of increased volatility (also reflected in the option IV) following the split that takes a period of time to settle down into a new normal. However, AMZN’s split occurs in a market that has been volatile and IV that is still somewhat elevated vs historical averages. The only thing traders can look for is any increased retail interest in what are now much more reasonably priced (dollar-wise) options. This could affect things like upside skew and the potential for spreads or selling options vs stock that can benefit from skew in a way that retail was previously unable to affect due to the large dollar prices of most options in a $2000+ stock. Something to keep an eye on.\n\nIt initially looked like Alphabet would do its announced 20 for 1 split this week as well but it is now likely mid-July. Amazon shares saw a fairly decent run-up into its split. GOOGL options are pricing about an 8% move out to July 15th:  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e2vxt38o6w391.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=5138a9f42127cc08c5e4838c053396552aefec4d\n\n## Earnings\n\n*Links* below go to the Options AI calendar where you can see the other companies each day and click through to see charts (free to use).

{"title": "A Guide to CSPs", "selftext": "# This post is a guide on the cash-secured put. It will teach you what a CSP is, what conditions are favourable for this trade, and how to turn a CSP from a delta trade into a theta trade.\n\n# What is a CSP?\n\nTraders who sell puts receive a premium upfront but are assigned stock if the stock price is below the strike price at expiration. Naturally, this is a bullish strategy; we want the stock price to be at or slightly above the strike so that we make our maximum profit. This is also a short volatility strategy; we prefer the stock price to stay calm since we don't benefit from the stock price shooting upwards past our strike. However, we take steep losses if the stock plummets.\n\nOTM covered calls are the same as an ITM short put - if the stock price is below the strike at expiration, you keep your premium and end up with 100 shares of stock,  otherwise, you only get your premium. In this post, I will talk about selling puts and covered calls interchangeably since the only difference is the strikes chosen for these strategies.\n\n# When Should We Sell Puts?\n\nWe should sell puts when 2 conditions are met:\n\n* We should sell puts when we are bullish on the stock. Because we lose money when the stock falls past our strike, we should sell puts when we think that this situation is unlikely to happen.\n* We should sell puts when we don't think the stock will be volatile. If the stock is calm, this minimizes the chances of us missing out on a big rally or losing money from the stock price falling.\n\n*Selling puts is a* b*ullish, short volatility strategy.*\n\n**When should we NOT sell puts?**\n\n* We should not sell puts if we expected the stock to slowly fall towards our strike at expiration. A bearish strategy such as shorting the stock or selling calls/call spreads is better for a bearish outlook.\n* We should *definitely* not sell puts if we expected the stock to quickly dip to our strike and then rally back up before expiration. If we're short a put, we lose money on the way down and then break even after the stock recovers. A limit order would be better here since you could buy the dip and profit from the rally.\n* We should also not sell puts if we expect a BIG rally since your max profit would be the premium collected. Buying the stock or a call/call spread would be better.\n\n# The Greeks\n\nSince selling puts is an options strategy, we should look at is the greeks:\n\nWhen selling puts or covered calls, we are:\n\n1. Long Delta\n2. Short Gamma\n3. Long Theta\n4. Short Vega\n\n**Delta**\n\nDelta is our option's sensitivity to changes in the underlying stock price. If the stock price increases by $1, a 30 delta call makes $30.\n\nBeing long delta is usually a good thing - after all, stocks tend to go up. This is especially true of diversified indices such as the S&P since index prices don't fall because of company news, Elon Musk tweets, or Cathie Wood buying the stock.\n\n**CSPs are mostly a delta trade.**\n\nWhile CSPs have theta, that doesn't make it a \"Theta Trade\". Most of the PnL from these trades comes from the options' delta. Look at the Greeks of the July $400 SPY Short Put:\n\n[SPY Short Put](https://preview.redd.it/uo9wbywd21491.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=e601fd3a8f3a80f11b8f8f8d1e7bd27448ce311f)\n\nWe can see that there is nearly $15 of Theta, but we have over $35 of Delta. Not only that, SPY's expected daily move is 1.2% or nearly $5! While we make $15 a day in Theta, the value of our put can change by $175 depending on which way SPY moves tomorrow.\n\n**Gamma**\n\nOptions allow for unlimited gains with limited losses. As a result, they have gamma: delta changes over time. If a call option becomes far OTM, delta becomes close to 0 and the option buyer cannot lose more than the premium paid. However, if the stock rallies and the call becomes deep ITM, the call will have close to 100 deltas; the option buyer's gains are unlimited.\n\nOption sellers have limited gains but unlimited losses. This means that gamma works against them - sellers have less delta when the stock is moving in their favour but pick up more delta when the stock moves against them.\n\nLet's say we sell the 35 delta put. When the stock goes up, the trader loses delta - the 35 delta short put may only have 20 deltas after an up move, so the position makes less money than 35 shares of stock would. However, the 35 delta short put may become 50 delta as the stock falls, so the position loses more than 35 shares would. This is why buying stock is sometimes better than selling a put; 35 shares will always be 35 shares.\n\n**When we are short gamma, we want the stock to** ***STAY ABSOLUTELY STILL.*** **This allows us to collect theta while minimising our chances of losing out on a big rally or getting Wendy's dumpstered by falling prices.**\n\nLuckily, stocks tend to be less volatile than option prices imply they will be. This is called the *Variance Risk Premium.*\n\n**Theta**\n\nOptions allow for unlimited gains while losses are capped at the premium paid. This is why options have extrinsic value. Theta describes the decay of this extrinsic value over time.\n\n***THETA IS NOT AN EDGE.*** Theta compensates traders for being short gamma. However, we have to consider whether we're getting *enough* Theta to make up for the times we miss out on a rally or get caught on the wrong side of a market crash. **Our edge is being** ***overcompensated*** **by theta.**\n\nFor example, traders wouldn't sell a 1 DTE, ATM call for $2 in premium if they expected the stock to move $10 in either direction tomorrow - they'd only make $2 when the stock falls by $10, but lose $8 the other half of the time when the stock moves up. This would not be a profitable trade in the long run.\n\n**Vega**\n\nVega describes the sensitivity of the option to changes in implied volatility - the market's expectation of future volatility. \n\nStock volatility is great for option buyers (and sucks for option sellers who are short gamma). Intuitively, if the market suddenly believes the stock to be more volatile than previously expected, option buyers bid up these options and sellers demand higher prices for being short gamma. \n\nThis sucks if we already sold options in the past since it will now cost more to buy these options back. \n\n# Making a CSP a \"Theta Trade\"\n\nEarlier in this post, I mentioned how CSPs were mostly delta trades. What if we wanted it to be a theta trade instead? We can hedge our 35 delta put by selling 35 shares of SPY. Now we are free to collect our theta without worrying about which way SPY will go.\n\nOf course, this isn't the full story; we are still short gamma. As SPY falls, our puts have more delta and vice versa. We will have to sell stock as SPY falls and buy stock as SPY rises in order to stay hedged - buying high and selling low. \n\nBeing short gamma means that we lose money buying high and selling low as the stock moves around. This is why we want the stock to stay still so we can collect our theta in peace.\n\nImplied volatility tells us that our losses from gamma cancel our gains from theta at that specific level of volatility. ***Generally speaking, if the stock is less volatile than IV, option sellers who delta hedge will make money. If the stock is more volatile and IV, option buyers who delta hedge will make money.***\n\n# Conclusion\n\n* CSPs are a bullish, short volatility trade\n* CSPs are mostly a delta trade; however, we can turn it into a theta trade by hedging our deltas.", "id": "v67zay", "created_utc": 1654534318.0, "score": 192, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 43, "comments": [{"body": "Just remember to close CSPs before an earnings event or you’ll end up with 200 shares of PLTR at $22 like me", "score": 46, "replies": [{"body": "Why do a CSP on a stock that you don't want?

You are only risking 50% of the investment while keeping 50% in cash or treasuries to earn risk free yield (which can compensate for the premium paid on the option). This $5 premium is also the max time decay you will see on these options, and it is both a risk and time-value premium. It is cheap because these are so deeply in the money (delta 0.97).\n\nIn case we get a black swan event you are, at any point,  risking less capital. Thats just a mathematical fact. If we drop to anywhere above the strike price, your option will drop in value almost exactly (but slightly less) like the 100 shares; if we drop far below it, your losses on the option are capped at 100% (but you only deployed 50% of your capital, so 50%), while your shares can continue to lose value up to the full 100% of your available capital. \n\nAt that point you still have 50% of your capital left to deploy. Then you can do either the following:\n\nA) deploy the 50% cash and buy shares, you will now end up with the exact same amount *or more* as when you had bought them straight up to begin with.\n\nB) Running a renewed similar strategy at a lower strike price (which will now costs you about an additional 25% of your capital). This once again gives you the same upside as shares with still cash left\n\nC) You just keep your 50% safe, as you never put it at risk to begin with.\n\nHow long it takes for the economy to recover is irrelevant, you just keep rolling the same strategy. \n\nI get that is a bit counterintuitive and it requires a lot more active management, but thats just how these strategies work.

This would equate to a BNH yearly return of (600/411)\\^(1/10) = 1.07 or 7%, which is the long term average for SPY.\n\nIn the scenario where you bought calls, your option would have been now worth $14K, and assuming you bought two to match the equity in the BNH scenario, you'd have lost about $13K. \n\nWhereas with BNH, you'd be looking at smaller losses - only $6K.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Lmao why would you include an additional 8 years of doing nothing within the risk-definition of the original scenario.

After that you are faced with a new choice: buy shares, buy new leaps or hold cash as i literally explained here. Obviously if you choose cash you wont outperform spy in the period after it if it continues up. \n\nIn your scenario I end the 2 year period with:\n\nScenario A: a $6100 loss\n\nScenario B + 50% remaining capital in a 2-year treasury currently yielding 3%: $6600 loss + $1236 gain from the bond = $5364 loss. $750 less lost than scenario A\n\nScenario C obviously lost a lot more but like I said, thats using the leap as leverage and is more risky. That was the point.\n\nNow for the next 8 remaining years you can still choose to opt for the buy and hold if these active decisions are too stressful for you and then it looks like this:\n\nScenario A all the way 10 years long: 100 shares at $411 to $800 = $38900 profit\n\nScenario B into Buy and hold after expiry in 2 years: Capital reduced to $35736 after 2 years, now buying at SPY 350: 102 shares instead of the 100 you wouldve had in scenario A.

Well, because I've intentionally left out the dividend yields in scenario A for the sake of the example of leaps vs shares in a no-dividend scenario.
