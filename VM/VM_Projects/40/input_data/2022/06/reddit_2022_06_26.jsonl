I argue the onus would be on you to explain why it doesn't work. Just to humor you, here is a recent trade I took that was PURELY based on technicals.\n\nMacro setup: We're in a bear market so macro trend is down (up for this inverse ETF).....I have long bias. Price was consolidating and built clear higher lows on the 50. Clear upper range resistance and macro pivot levels forming.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/WBPhnx2D/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/WBPhnx2D/)\n\nIntraday setup: Price was consolidating intraday on declining volume throughout the day. Price was finding support or prior days HOD. Price was starting to find support on VWAP (yellow line) intraday.\n\nsignal/execution: Price left lower wicks as it retested VWAP and prior days HOD for the second time AND increasing volume as price started to bounce away from those levels. I enter and front run the break of the range w/ stop under VWAP. Price breaks range. Moved my stop to under the range. Price retests range and resumes up. Breakout, retest, resumption on building volume -- breakout is confirmed.\n\n[https://www.tradingview.com/x/9QcN7pWX/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/9QcN7pWX/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are my actual orders (1 buy in blue) and scale outs (red).

These are setups and price action that I am familiar with and structure trade around. Is there any guarantee that these setups will result in a 30% move like they did? No absolutely not. This happened to be an ABSURD 5start setup with a super rare confluence of situations but because I watch these setups daily for the last several years, I know that it's a high probability. These setups are not always as high probability...in fact, my strategy on this setup (and other similar ones) only has a 25.57% win rate. On average I make 10.22% on each winner and 2.73% on each losing trade. I could go on...\n\nMy point is that to say something like \"TA doesnt work\" is so comically misinformed. TA is whatever you make it. Some people are better technical analysts than others. Some people see things others don't. Yes, some people definitely try to use TA in stupid fucking ways to confirm a narrative that they are married too. The point is that TA is simply one of many tools that can be used to help assess market probabilities, structure trades, and manage risk.\n\nSo again, I will put this back to you to please explain why you think it \"doesn't work\".", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Why have numerous well-organized studies failed to show that TA has any predictive power?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Again...you're completely missing the point and failing to understand the purpose/value of TA.

I meant \"again\" as in, you are coming at this from the same direction as the original person was (and most others that try to hate on TA)...so assuming your read the top of the thread, then; again, I will explain... \n\nRegarding the predictive power, let's think about it like this: we know that stocks exhibit the same (or very similar) price action, over and over and over. So as I showed with my trade example above, that setup is one in which I am very familiar with and scan for over and over. How that setup resolves is dependent on a huge number of variables....so many that I do think you could say that it's mostly random. BUT there are times when you can identify enough relevant variables aligning which will tilt probabilities in your favor. Then, because you can frame the context of the price action through various technical inputs, you can structure a trade and manage risk. \n\nSo yes, obviously a little triangle on a chart or a fib retracement, or a s/r level on a chart does not have stand alone predictive power, but when you consider other factors, it can help inform odds of certain outcomes. \n\nTo me people that say \"ta is bullshit\" is like saying \"music is bullshit\"....no, some musicians are terrible and their music sucks, but saying \"music is bullshit\" just doesn't even make sense as a statement.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">Regarding the predictive power, let's think about it like this: we know that stocks exhibit the same (or very similar) price action, over and over and over.\n\nThis is begging the question.

Use my trade that I outlined above as an example. [https://www.tradingview.com/x/sJsS1uMm/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/sJsS1uMm/)\n\nThis multi-day range obviously doesn't have predictive power in the sense of \"it formed a range therefore it will break up and out\" but it does indicate where there are clear buyers and sellers. So, if price breaks over the resistance level, then it's likely that demand has overcome supply and followthrough might occur. Thats just a basic observation and following price..nothing predictive. Where I got predictive with this trade which made me comfortable putting on a big position is by factoring in a number of other variables: the price action on the VIX, price action on SPY, QQQ, and IWM, volume, known upcoming catalysts (inflation data), general market trend (down), momentum indicators.\n\nI keep saying this....the technicals framed the setup and allowed me to establish clear levels which \\*COULD\\* help to confirm the trade one way or another. The likelihood of the trade to work as I thought it would is more determined by the other factors.And this is where I was saying to the other guy that I don't think computers could analyze and trade \\*exclusively\\* based on TA. Sure they can outline the patterns on the chart, but as we all agree that those patterns alone don't have predictive power over future price movements, so what would the computer do with those patterns without the other variables as inputs to the strategy.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "On the first point:  \nYou said the following: *Regarding the predictive power, let's think about it like this: we know that stocks exhibit the same (or very similar) price action, over and over and over.*\n\nSaying \"We know stocks exhibit the same price action over and over\" is tantamount to saying \"We know TA works.\"  My argument is that there is no such reliable pattern that exists in stock charts.  We can't learn that there is an increased probability of a stock doing y in the future because it did x on the chart.\n\n\"Begging the question\" means you assume the conclusion from the beginning.  \n\n\nOn the second point:  I think you're missing the bottom line here.  Either TA has some amount of connection with future price action or it doesn't.  If it doesn't, it's useless.  If it does, it has predictive power.  There's no logical in between.

If I form the belief that it's going to rain tomorrow because my dog didn't eat his food this morning, and then it rains tomorrow, I haven't suddenly found a system.  I just got lucky.  And humans are often very bad at distinguishing between luck and epistemic success, which is why confirmation biases are a thing.  \n\n\nEdit: I should add that TA on indicies is even less tenable, IMO.
