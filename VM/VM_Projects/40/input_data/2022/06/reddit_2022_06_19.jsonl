{"title": "How I \"plan\" to not lose a penny in this market", "selftext": "I'm writing this in the hopes that it helps at least one person, and at the same time it validates what I have learned throughout the years investing and trading.\n\n- the amount indicated in my portfolio varies weekly. While it used to stress me out to see it go down and made me happy when it went up, I realized something: feelings don't pay bills.  Only when I make a profit on a sale can I take that cash out and pay for something. Nothing else matters.\n\n- I chose my 10 \"champion\" companies and decided I would use the volatility to generate cash.\n\n- I'm getting ahead of myself. I'm now 55. I retired last year after going all in on the dip in airlines a little bit late in summer of 2020. I don't have a million dollars but decided that with zero debt I could probably live off the proceeds of 300k CAD. The cost of living in my corner of small town Canadian paradise is relatively low.\n\n- I divided my funds in slices that vary in sizes depending on amount of uncertainty in the market. Lately the slices got pretty thin. They used to be about 4k in the bull market. Now the slices have run out as the remaining funds are slated to be next year's living expenses, about 25k. Some of that will be tax free. \n\n- When one my companies decreased 5-8% I would buy a slice. When it would increase by that amount I would sell a slice. At stated above the only thing that matters to me is the amount of cash generated and that's how I \"rate\" myself. I keep track of the details of each transaction. \n\n- My plan was/is to buy companies all the way down and sell all the way up. Now, as I've run out of slices, I need to wait for a sale before my next purchase. I won't lie, it's simple but it's not easy. Buying all the way down gives me the greatest chance of being close in price to a sell whenever it rises. \n\n- I do not plan on losing a penny by selling at a loss. That's what the big boy shorters want me to do. Also by not selling I get the second benefit of timing the turnaround perfectly without risking another penny. \n\n- It's not easy looking at a portfolio total melting but the way I see it is: the companies I chose are good, they're not going anywhere. Their value remains and SP will come back. I have one year of cash to live on and a second year of credit line if really needed. Another thing that is kinda weird is that, on most days, the portfolio total somehow becomes just a number, not a feeling, a number divisible in slices, a tool to generate cash which is the only thing that pays bills.\n\nPS: so far in 2022, I was generating an average of 2k/ month , about 60% of which is tax free. So far in June I made 150.00 but the month's revenue can be generated in 1-3 decent days... sometimes. About 1/3 of my total portfolio has been frozen under water for about 14 months.

So in that 15 year period, my explorations have not given me great returns. Even in 2019, I was still flapping my wings busily but not getting much off the ground. In both 2019 and 2020, I only made transactions during 6 months of both years buying only the main indexes. I made 4.7% (9.7k )and 3% (9.6k) in 2019 and 2020 respectively. In 2021, I made transactions from March to December and made 59% (162k) pretty much all on JETS ETF and a couple of individual stocks. In 2022, I have made transactions every month to date with a 5% return (13.5K), using only 10 individual stocks. These are all cash gains, not paper gains.\n\nI asked myself before if I'm beating the \"main index.\" I found out the answer is more complicated than financial media make it. To get a true reading you would need to start Jan. 1 with 100% cash and go all in, and sell all Dec. 31 and take a measure. That does not mirror real life when you have large portions of your portfolio carrying over when the year starts. My \"system\" works for me. The main index would not give me the volatility that I need to trade and respect my money management. Also buying and holding, in my view, while it's good for some people, is like hiring someone else to take care of your garden, and only coming at retirement to reap the harvest. My seeds need a lot of supervision, and they have given me many harvests at differing periods during the year. If I didn't spend the time that I do, a lot of harvests would simply rot in the ground, i.e. the valleys would not be bought and the peaks sold. I should mention that I spend about 2-4 hours daily on market activities.\n\nThis is not for everybody but the period of wing flapping from 2004-2019 has helped drive the qualities that I believe that I need: disciplined, detailed money management and record-keeping, patience and skepticism.

As for stock markets in Japan elsewhere, that would be a terrible place to buy the index, but I'm sure they have many individual stocks that do very well.

The reason 1/3 of my portfolio is occupied by one stock, which is underwater, is because I got too cocky after a big win and bought way too much, way too quickly. That mistake drilled home the importance of buying slowly, at price points 5-8% in difference. Had I done that, that stock would be another cash generator today as I would have price points that I could have sold at a profit. Another thing that experience has driven home is to sell when you meet the 5-8% profit level, therefore allowing you to buy that same slice at your original buy price.
