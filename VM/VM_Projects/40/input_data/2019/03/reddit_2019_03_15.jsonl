Tesla has 80% of the market share on a $0.00 advertising budget. As EV demand explodes exponentially... they will indeed loose a significant amount of that share to competitors. But even if they were 15% of global EVS sold pushing 25 million a year in 5 years— that’s still 4x the amount of EVS they’re selling today; with the company valued around 50 billion. The more units Tesla sells, the better for the margins— and they could survive like a small player like Mazda.
