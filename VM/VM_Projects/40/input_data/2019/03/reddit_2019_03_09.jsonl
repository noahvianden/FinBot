I’m very pro renewables. \n\nTesla isn’t the only company creating renewables, in fact they aren’t even a big player. Bad business plans hurt the entire industry. SUNE set solar back, as well as Solyndra. Solar City was crumbling before Tesla merged with them, and their renewable business is on shell of what it used to be. Sunrun will probably be the next one to crumble.\n\nIn terms of software for grid solutions AMSC has done more. Enphase is doing really neat things in the consumer space.\n\nIn terms of consumer battery storage, I think Shell is very interesting. Sonnen has a great product, I hope shell can really dump resources into it.\n\nFor renewable roll out, GE, First Solar, Sunpower, or Acciona, have done more. The really interesting stuff is what Dong, and Iberdorla are doing.\n\nI have nothing against renewables, solar, or EVs. It should be obvious from how much time I spend on here, I’m actually very interested in them. I think it’s the future, and a lot of neat tech is being deployed. But I also don’t think solar is 100% the solution, hydro, wind, offshore wind, and tidal, and geo-thermal all have their place. The most exciting part about the energy future, is for once it won’t be dominated by a single source.\n\nEdit:\nThe business model has to be sustainable, not just the products. I think Tesla has great products.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Probably I was unfair. \n\nTried to contrast (in a hopefully not so boring manner) what you linked to with what really matters.

Tesla showed that they can be fast and desirable. Both are needed - before Tesla, everyone thought EVs were for city use only. And if it wasn't for Leaf, everyone would think that EVs are really only for the rich. I have much respect for Carlos Ghosn and Nissan/Renault for driving that change (though his recent moves did tarnish that respect considerably).\n\nI do however think that the world really needed an EV manufacturer that didn't have a second leg to stand on - it's either success or bust and no going back to producing gas cars. That forced them to take risks no regular manufacturer would, could or should and therefore accelerate the change.\n\nWe will be needing more companies with that attitude to combat other areas of climate change.

An electric fleet auto would obviously be a step in the right direction, and Tesla has turbocharged that effort.\n\nThe counterbalance to that, though, is that the \"Elon is saving the world contingent\" is equally melodramatic.  EVs are a small piece of a *much* larger puzzle, and Musk/Tesla are not solely responsible for them.\n\nI also think there *is* something to the idea that a focus on luxury cars and technical advancement also lets us distract ourselves from the bigger picture.  Inherent in any real analysis of our environmental situation is a cold, hard fact.  An ugly fact.  A fact that doesn't really mesh well with Elon's persona or Tesla's branding:  \n\nThe modern first world consumer lifestyle is utterly unsustainable at a basic level.  Any real solution will require a drastic lifestyle realignment, and \"solutions\" that let people think they're doing something while avoiding any actual sacrifice or lifestyle change could actually be counterproductive.  When you say \"Tesla is saving the world\", you're selling the idea that we can keep on doing what we're doing now, but with better technology and more efficiency.  That's really just not true. \n\n \"Fixing\" the current situation probably looks more like \"no cars for most people\" than \"electric cars for everyone\".
