But no, your arguments seem immune to evidence, you *still* insist that Tesla is worth less. 😉\n\nSo much about your automotive finance 'knowledge', of which knowledge you've demonstrated absolutely nothing in this thread ...\n\n> So let's make it meaningful. Let's bet on. Q1 deliveries and profit (or should I say loss).\n\nOh, so *that's* your spiel? That as Tesla scales up their production by perhaps ~40%-50% in this quarter and ties up capital and revenue as in-transit vehicles: a situation that stagnant gascar OEMs have never faced for the last 50 years,  as they never ever get double digit quarter to quarter growth of their production ... ?\n\nOh wow, that's a classic TSLAQ argument from you! 😉\n\nI have news for you: despite that one time ramp-up capital cost Tesla is ***still*** going to generate a massive amount of cash from operations in Q1 - possibly north of 1 billion dollars, and is probably *still* going to have a positive free cash flow.\n\nYes, they probably won't post GAAP profits in Q1 due to this, as Elon has guided already. Why do you want to bet on a near certain thing that Elon guided for?\n\nIf you were a true 'automotive financial expert' you'd know all this ...\n\nWant to bet on cash flow from operations and on free cash flow instead? Thought so ...\n\nHow about the following additional bets:\n\n- Will each of Tesla's 2019 quarters generate more cash from operations than their **largest ever** dilutive equity financing round was? I.e. will Tesla generate the equivalent cash of their biggest equity financing round every single quarter, but via internally generated income?\n- Which month is Chanos going to throw in the towel and liquidate his short position? May-June? August-September?\n- When is Tesla going to be included in the S&P 500? August-September?\n- Which month is Moody's going to upgrade Tesla's corporate bonds. In April, on the anniversary of the downgrade, or will it happen later?\n- How much total cash flow from operations is Tesla going to generate in 2019 - is it going to be more than 5 billion dollars, enough to finance their planned capex, the remaining debt repayments and extra growth capex as well?\n- Which month of 2019 is Tesla going to deliver their 1 millionth EV?\n\nOh, and btw., let's see how my latest prediction fared:\n\n>> Prediction: in your next reply you'll fail to understand any of what I've written above, you'll write obtuse TSLAQ talking points and false narratives instead. 😉\n\nBullseye!! 😉", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Why do you give this person so much time of your life?
