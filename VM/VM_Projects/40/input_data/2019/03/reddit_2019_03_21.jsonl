If we assume that production went on at about a 5k+2k/week rate in January and February then the approximate cost of revenues was around ~$3.2b. (Note that I'm being overly generous to the TSLAQ argument here: automotive cost of revenues includes a number of non-cash and probabilistic expenses like stock compensation, warranty reserves and depreciation costs.)\n\nThere's also corporate overhead of about $356m R&D and $667m SG&A, which, assuming it's distributed evenly in the quarter (which it is mostly) scales  to another cash expense of about -$600m in the first two months. (Let's assume that Energy and Services is a approximate break-even for the first two quarters - but feel free to include a small loss there if you are so inclined: it makes no difference to the end result.)\n\nI'm also rounding down the -$3.2b to -$3.6b, because Tesla has increased production some more, and to be on the safe side.\n\nAt this point I believe even the TSLAQ geniuses are able to apply math and see the rough balance of payments for automotive cash flows:\n\n    +3.7b +0.8b +1.0b +0.35b +0.8b = +$6.65b\n    -3.6b -0.9b -0.6b              = -$5.10b\n\nThere's an approximate +1.5b gap between the two, with fairly conservative assumptions and a number of upsides - while the *downsides* are all *discretionary*, i.e. a result of Tesla getting more orders for cars and making more cars than planned, entirely voluntarily.\n\nTesla can also draw their ABL line to an extent of +$2.4b. So they have effective working capital somewhere in the +$3.9b range even 2 months into the quarter when most of the customer payments for cars already built are still missing. \n\nNot a difficult concept to understand! ðŸ˜‰\n\n**TL;DR:** You guys are demonstrating a *very* poor understanding of the automotive sector and its financial environment.\n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Answer the question about the bet", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "So the accounts payable argument was right?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "He still hasn't addressed it.
