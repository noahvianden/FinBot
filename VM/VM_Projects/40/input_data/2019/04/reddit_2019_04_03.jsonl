{"title": "What I learned this winter...", "selftext": "Last spring my Dad passed away leaving me with a portion of his 401k. It wasn’t a crazy amount, around $50k, and after paying off some debt I put $30k into an Ally account and bought AAPL, AMZN and a couple others right at the peak. My average share cost for AAPL was like $220 and almost $2k for AMZN. I knew they were high but I don’t need this money for 30 or so years and took the “time in the market beats timing the market” to heart.\n\nThen fall came and things starting dropping, at one point after the Xmas eve drop I was down almost $10k....that hurt. I averaged down when I could, and tried to learn everything I could from here and other subs and articles. This sub was always full off sound advice and being a gift from my Dad I wanted to do this right and not panic. I saw others sell off and stopped looking at my account everyday, moved some things into ULTA and LULU, and today I can finally say I’m even. I haven’t contributed much since last summer but it’s been awesome learning to not panic and stick to my plan. \n\nMonday is the one year anniversary of his passing, and I feel like he would’ve been proud of what I did. I owe lots of that to this sub and all the sage advice. If anyone else is in that spot trust your research and don’t go crazy. Time is on your side.

An even better lesson is to buy and hold a (globally) diversified lazy portfolio. \n\nBuying a single stock or two and holding for a long time is still *very* risky and rarely recommended outside of r/wallstreetbets. Amazon and Apple may not last forever. Remember Sears was the Amazon of its time. Today Sears is bankrupt. Also the next Enron is somewhere around the corner. Another example is, say you bought intel stock in 1999, you would still be 30% under to this day, 20 years later. \n\nAnd the last, most important lesson is dollar cost averaging. Do not make large financial moves in lump sum. Instead, average them out over periods of time, this way you won’t catch a bull market at its peak. But also, dont sit out and try to time the market. Keep investing with discipline. \n\nWe cannot predict the market. We can not pick winners and losers with great accuracy.
