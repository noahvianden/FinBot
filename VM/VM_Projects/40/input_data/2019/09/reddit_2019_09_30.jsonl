{"title": "The Case for Gold", "selftext": "All of us in the silver and gold gang have been getting pillaged for the last month or so, and the price action looks particularly dire right now, so I figured it‚Äôd be a good time to lay out a bull case for metals.\n\nFirst of all, to establish some context, if you zoom out the chart just a little bit, you might notice the GLD outperforms SPY pretty handily over the past year...the longer term trend seems to be working in gold‚Äôs favor.  I realize I‚Äôm posting this on WSB and that long term is defined as two weeks or longer for most WSB options slangers, so if you are immediately bored just by reading the word ‚Äúyear‚Äù I‚Äôd highly suggest skipping the rest of this post.  I see no reason for the gold trend to stop, and in the last couple of months the macroeconomic data and central bank policy decisions have all really supported the bull case in my opinion:\n\n- The Eurozone is in trouble, and doesn‚Äôt have any interest rate left to cut.\n\nParts of the Eurozone (Germany) already appear to be sliding into recession, and the ECB doesn‚Äôt have many tools left besides to print Euros and buy assets, which they have recently started doing.  I think that this central bank philosophy - do whatever it takes to ‚Äúsustain the expansion‚Äù (Jerome Powell‚Äôs words, not mine) - is going to lead to a lot more money printing around the world as global growth slows down.  This leads me to point number 2...\n\n- The Fed is practically guaranteed to start printing money soon\n\nJerome Powell has shown his aversion to negative interest rates, but is definitely committed to providing stimulus as necessary to sustain the expansion, and he hinted at the last press conference that the Fed would evaluate ‚Äúorganic‚Äù growth of it‚Äôs balance sheet in the near term.  There‚Äôs a more acute issue, though - the liquidity shortage in the banking system!  The recent repo rate fiasco implies that there is a dollar shortage, which is probably related to the ballooning government deficit.  Sadly, the banking system appears to no longer be able to finance the U.S. government, and something has to give - either the U.S. government starts spending less money, or the Fed monetizes some of the debt to inject some more liquidity into the system.  I think the second option is far more likely. \n\n- Political turmoil is good for gold\n\nThis is the weakest part of the bull case in my opinion, because it‚Äôs by far the hardest to predict.  I‚Äôll mention it here for posterity, but I wouldn‚Äôt go long based on this alone.\n\nTo sum it up, I think in the next year or two we are going to see a general fiat currency devaluation as central banks start to (or continue to) print money to fight off slowing global growth.  If this thesis is correct it‚Äôs going to take time to play out - trading this with short term options is probably impossible.
