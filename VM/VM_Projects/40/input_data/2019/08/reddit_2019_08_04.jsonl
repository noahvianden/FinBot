These franchises were then worried that the automakers might change their mind and open their own stores to compete directly. They convinced state legislatures to outlaw this along with incorporating it into their franchise agreements. Tesla not following this model has really irked the dealers as a result. They are big donors for the state legislators and have a lot of jobs so it makes getting the laws changed very difficult and come with a lot of conflict.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "The automakers also tried to make themselves recession proof by basically forcing the dealerships to agree to buy the same number of cars from them every year regardless of if they sold or not, with threats of not selling them their cars anymore if they didn't. This kind of abuse is part of why the pendulum swung against the automakers and got us the current laws we have today.\n\nAlso, a lot of states are heavily dependent on dealerships for a good chunk of their tax revenue. Car sales can make up like 20% of their sales tax revenue, which adds motivation for them to throw up protectionist laws for the dealerships.", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is the correct answer.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The US Supreme Court has ruled that **Corporations are people**, and **Money is Speech**.\n(This is not a joke but the hard facts).   \n\nIn addition, politicians frequently win purely based on the amount of money they can fundraise, because there's limited if no public funds available for political campaigns.   \n\nAs such, corporate political lobbying is a huge business. A lot of **govt appointees are former professional lobbyists**, and some government leaders leave to become a lobbyist for the industry they used to regulate.  \nFor example, the current head of the Environmental Protection Agency is a former Coal industry lobbyist.    \n\nAt the local government level, the Auto Dealers associations are significant sponsors of politicians. The state governers/senators/congressmen are thus incentivized to pass laws that protect the business interests of Auto Dealers.   \n\n**References**:\n\nCitizens United v.
