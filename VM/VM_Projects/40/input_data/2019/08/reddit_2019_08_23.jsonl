Then wait until 3:55 to buy call options on SPY, QQQ, or DIA. The market will need to reverse the following morning. I will answer question in the link below as the day goes on\n\n/r/options/comments/bo6s0u/putcall_gamma_options_traders_make_100_return_in/\n\n\nAs of right now the market looks like it could close the day with an accelerated sell off due to market makers needing to hedge and get delta neutral - (ie they could aggressively start to sell the underlying at the end of the day, which would exacerbate the current sell off.) Also, keep in mind even if you miss buying Puts during the last hour, there is also a profitable trade buying calls after 3:55ish on the indexes SPY, DIA, QQQ, because market makers typically have to buy the market back in the morning the following day, which leads to a huge pop in the AM following a large downward move the previous day.\n\nGood Luck if you decide to take on the strategy :)\n\nHere is the link to the below original strategy :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUIE7u_2S_GDnHH6h7i7DgQ\n\nWatch \"Why US Millennial, China 2020 Liberalization, & US International Investment Position Matter!\" on YouTube\nhttps://youtu.be/SILErY0mDf0", "id": "cuhco6", "created_utc": 1566582702.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 53, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Yea its a two pronged mean reversion strategy.

I hope it helps clarify. \n\nI thought i may have added some confusion. In the video I am using a mean reverting strategy on the weekly moves in the equity indexes, so the standard deviation i'm targeting is on a percentage basis, which correlates to taking position when std dev is between 1.5 to 1.7 on either side. In the strategy i posted above which relates to the last hour trading I am relying on the daily standard deviation using a points system (as opposed to percentages) where I am looking to take advantage of a 4 or 5 standard deviation move from the mean.\n\nFor example using the DOW typically the mean is like 80-120 points (i don't have the excel in front so this is off the top of my head), so on a day where the DOW points wise moves 4 or 5 standard deviations from the typical mean points wise, after 2pm, I am interested in putting on a position to take advantage of the increase in realized volatility. I realized after reviewing some of the questions it may have been a bit confusing.\n\nLet's say DOW implied vol is 14 - markets expect a 0.88% movement - Dow is currently at 25,000 (would be +/- 220 points), so we all know realized volatility is almost always substantially below, so the move is likely going to be much closer to 0.4% or 100 points - When i see the DOW move more then 450 or 500 plus points, the daily idiosyncratic risk market makers face in getting delta neutral on a sell off increases. From a points system the daily move goes into the 4 or 5 standard deviation from the typical mean of 80 to 100 points.

What will happen if market rally upwards 1.5+ st dev, will the MM's reaction be the same, or will they Buy into close and sell into open? thanks", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Hey infamous thanks for the question. I'm going to answer your last question first and work backwards. The market has changed due to the following reasons. (1.) Large Share Repurchase programs, (2.) Central bank balance sheet expansion, (3.) Programmatic Trend following algos, (4.) Programmatic Volatiltiy Targeting Algos and Strategies, (5.) Historically Low Equity Volumn (due to falls in overall share count outstanding), (6.) Significant increase in Passive investing (Which tends to lower realized volatility), and (7) late economic cycle unhedged cash flows into the portfolio channel. \n\nThe above factors have a structural influence on both sides of the coin through what I am going to call the realized volatility channel (my terminology.) What do I mean? Well, market strategies are tilted towards reacting to the two extremes in realized volatility. For example if realized volatility is low for a prolonged period the following strategies tend to slow the pace and size of the moves in the market limiting the ability of traders seeking to use mean reversion strategies realized volatilty. If the market goes up leverage increases, trend following algos buy, market makers are having to hedge less put exposure, so they act to suppress volatility helping to create the slow meltup. However, when we are at the opposite extreme and realized volatility rises, we see market makers exposure to hedging puts rise, which increases volatility as they delta hedge their exposure increasing volatilty.\n\nThese structural inefficiencies have tended to mean revert when the realized volatilty has been high enough to force a strong reaction by market makers. This past Friday was and should be a great example and we should see a rally on Monday.\n\nHopefully this makes sense and IMO to helping to understand the increase in volatilty and the question you asked.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the reply. For this to work, we're hoping the MM's are short gamma right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat is on a downward move with high realized vol, MM's will have to sell into the market to get delta neutral. And on the flip side case where market rally up, they will have to buy into market, as their put exposure is losing delta.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso is there a set rule on how many st dev move you want to see before planning a trade. In some cases, you said this could only work if it were 4-5 st dev move, but in Friday's case, it was 2 st dev move.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "We are not hoping we know they are short gamma they are options sellers. Why? They have institutional and retail clients they sell options to for various reasons. A better way to state the question is we would hope they have a higher exposure to short gamma through selling more put options then call options.\n\nI prefer 2 std dev (rounding up 1.7 std dev) if you are looking at the return on index on a weekly basis and also 4 std dev if you are doing it on a point total for the index in a single day. I know sounds confusing but in the video I made I am referencing this works using weekly returns and in this particular use of the strategy I am referencing daily point total returns on the index. Does that make sense?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "My bad, yes MM's are short gamma, but what I meant is, what you stated, do they have to have more short gamma exposure from puts or calls for this to work?\n\nIf they have more short exposure from selling puts, then it would make sense they would have to sell into market to get delta neutral, after a down move.  \n\n\nAlso is there any method you use to calculate how much the weekly st dev?\n\nI've been using expected daily move based on VIX and see if it moved higher than the daily implied.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Infamous_call again no issues or worries here. I like the debate I think it adds value to helping better communicate my strategy to others. \n\nFirst, I will answer yes, it is preferable they have to sell more short options increasing their exposure to hedging puts rather then calls. Puts inherently increase realized volatility. I tend to look at skew to see if out of the money puts are trading at significantly low valuations during the day. I also making a gut feeling or assumption given relatively sharp increase in volumn some institutions may increase exposure to cover downside risk. The other issue may be what is called strike risk or clustering near a particular Strike on the indexes. For example, if 2,900 is where most of the put exposure (Where MMs  have sold to clients) is on say a weekly, then by default if the market were to drop from 2925 closer to 2900, the more work the MMs are going to have to do especially on shorter dated options near the strike. In my experience this usually excerbates the sell off and selling pressure. The other issue with a spike in realized volatility is the forced selling that has to happen immediatley and multiple days later by programmatic trading strategies. The strategies are forced to sell once realized volatility reaches a point higher then they are able to tolerate.\n\nYes, there is a method used to calculate weekly std deviation. I no longer use the conventional 20 or 30 years worth of data, because the market is inherently less volatile and it does not quite reflect the new world of low realized volatility we have been in since 2009. This differs from my opinion on global rebalancing and current account deficit, because that sort of stuff doesn't change much at all. I digress, but usually calculate std in 1 year, 3 year, and 5 years from 2009 to come up with a weekly std deviation. If you go to Yahoo and use this historic data and instead of daily set it to weekly returns on each of the indexes you should be able to create the weekly statistical information you need to generate mean, median, and standard deviation. Let me know if this helps.\n\nLast year I ran this strategy mostly on the weekly data in Q3 and Q4, so what I learned unfortunately is it is actually better to be patient and wait for the daily 4 standard deviation move or the weekly 1.7 to 2 then to try to implement it when this is not taking place. It requires a lot of patience. Most traders attempting to use this strategy on a daily repetition will run into trouble. If you are patient and wait to exploit the inefficiency you can be very profitable very quickly. If I could do it all over again I'd be very patient and sell convexity on strangles 4% out of the money until the opportunity arrives then go all in. Rinse wash and repeat. The strategy produces returns that are purposely skewed to the far right side of the distribution curve, so when you get it to work and your up 50% or 150% on the year. Relax, take time out, and sell options to collect income until the opportunity happens again. IMO", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "thanks for your replies, I really appreciate it. Just some clarifications I have, sorry I'm trying to learn as much as I can about trading.\n\nYou said you look at skew to see if OTM puts are trading significantly low valuations throughout the day, wouldn't that mean less puts are being bought from the MM's.\n\nI thought puts having high skew compared to call, relative to the normal skewness, would imply that more puts been bought from MM's, thus more short put hedging from MM's side.\\`", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes, you are correct.

Lol, I'm not sure what is so hard to get, but will try to answer it in a different way. No worries keep asking maybe I will explain it in a way that makes more sense to you etc\n\n1. It's a mean reversion strategy\n2. It's intended to take advantage of put/call gamma imbalance market makers delta hedging in high realized volatility \n3. It's your choice on how much directional gamma you would like to expose yourself to. In plain speak you are attempting to profit from extremely high dispersion (volatility) in the market. The speed at which the market moves allows you to directionally increase convexity, which increases the size of the return in a short period of time.\n4. If you choose weekly or monthly options your gamma and positive convexity exposure will increase and your returns will be higher. It also increases your risk on the trade. You have to really be on top of your exit from the contracts.\n5. If you choose quarterly or longer options your gamma and positive convexity exposure will be less intense and you are more exposed to Vega. This would decrease your risk and allow you more time to manage the position, but as with any long position in options your theta decay will reduce the value the longer you hold the position \n6. The strategy is intended to be implemented on days when the market moves at least 4 standard deviation and you can typically execute it around 2pm. \n7. You first buy puts at 2pm with the expectation the put/call gamma imbalance will force market makers to aggressively hedge their short gamma exposure to get delta neutral. (However not to complicate new traders, thereis also an opportunity for those who trade 24 hours if you want to exploit the correlation between the German Dax and S&P 500. During the morning before the European close between 10am and 1145am in US there is an opportunity to profit from same mean reversion, but I will put that information out there at another date.\n8. You sell the puts at 3:15 (recently has been the point at which algos have been stepping in and buying) or 3:45 And buy calls at 3:55pm into the sell off and hold the calls overnight. The following morning usually at the US open or before the European close 1130am you can sell the long calls for a profit. Pay attention on Sunday 6pm to see where US futures are and again before 930am on Monday morning to make your decision on selling the calls you are long.\n9. Typically if the move was 4 standard deviations market structure will force market makers to buy the market at the open on the following day. This usually pushes up the price of equities on the indexes mentioned. Then you sell the calls you are long.  \n10. I have stated in any given year these moves happen 8 to 12 times a year. The more volatility the higher the probability of taking advantage of the strategy.
