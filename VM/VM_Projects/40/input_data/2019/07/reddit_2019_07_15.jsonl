Sounds like tendies, right? BUT, that means that you are automatically (if you dont sell your contracts by Friday close) exercising 300 shares of AMD! At $35 per share thats 35x300=$10,500 worth of AMD stock. Do you have that much in your actual RH cash account? Because if not, then you will be required to use leverage to get the full value of your contracts. Do you even know how much leverage/margin you have with RH? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAND, let's say you do use, I dont know $5000 worth of margin. So next week, AMD can drop to 32 or 30, unlikely, but possible. Now you're losses are magnified if you held onto all those shares. If you had 5k in your cash account and used 5k margin to get all those shares, then a drop from 35 to 31.66 would deplete your total cash account by  $1000! Thats a 20% loss. Heres the math: 31.66\\*300 shares=9500. 10500-9500=1000. Guess what, that $1000 is coming out of your cash account, that's how losses get magnified by margin. So, buying calls isn't exactly risk free either if you're using margin to exercise them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, I think the best way to learn is to just trade one contract at a time, or one strategy at a time, maybe like once a week. Do your research and see what everybody else is saying and then go in on something you're pretty sure about. Bet using small sizes, never more than 10% of your account.
