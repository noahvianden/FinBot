{"title": "College Student Investment Options", "selftext": "Hey! I’m a third year college student in NYC, and a couple years ago I bought 5 stocks of DIS to test the investment waters. I’ve made a bit more than $160 off those, so I’m considering investing a bit more. I work during the summers, and I don’t want all my money just sitting in the bank, so I’m curious as to what my options are.\n\nI don’t want to sell DIS, so should I invest the $160 I made into another stock, invest some more into an ETF or Mutual Fund? I just would rather have my money appreciate so when I graduate I have some more money to keep me afloat (as an arts major), but don’t we all just want more money. I’m willing to assume some risk and do the research. I’m just wondering what you’d do. I have a couple thousand saved up now, and am still working.

For the vast majority of young people looking to build wealth, I'd recommend just sticking with S&P 500 index funds.

Mutual funds, index funds, and ETFs all help with this. And it’s IMO easier to construct a well balanced and well researched portfolio with funds rather than buying single stocks.\n\n\nWith a smallish sum of money like OP has ($2k), the options for diversification will be a lot more limited and it’ll take a substantial amount of research to properly diversify with single company stocks and construct a portfolio that can at least meet the return of the S&P 500. And like I said in my post above, I think fund managers can put together better performing portfolios with adequate risk profile than I ever could. Even they have a hard time trying to beat the S&P 500.\n\n\nIf you’re not diversifying enough, then you’re assuming too much risk, which is what professional fund managers really are: expert risk managers. Of course, you don’t have to go crazy with diversification (and my portfolio above is borderline overdiversified), but you definitely need a decent amount of diversification to moderate the amount of risk you subject yourself to.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "I’m low risk and with such, typically my opinions are disliked by the sub.\n\nI would pay the loans off.

They failed horribly. They had big supply chain problems, had a few high profile engineering issues, and Boeing leveraged their influence over the US Government to slap tariffs on the plane with questionable accusations of price-dumping as justification.
