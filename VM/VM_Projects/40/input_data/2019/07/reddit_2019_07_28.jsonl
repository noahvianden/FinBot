Veganism is growing rapidly because of a lot of reasons but mainly the environmental impact. \n\nNot everybody realizes it but beef has more government subsidies than about any other food group in the country. It's in the billions. We all pay a lot of taxes to keep beef in production. I think this only allows a 5% decrease in beef price but once farming practices change to serve the environment a lot of people fear that price will rise.\n\nPrices are less about a companies value and more about their perceived value. If Beyond can't continue to succeed over time it will drop. But if they can it might not. It's hard to say.
