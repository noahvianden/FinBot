{"title": "Iron Butterfly for earnings play", "selftext": "So I've been reading about different earnings play strategies (apart from naked options) and one of the lesser known/discussed strategy I found is Iron Butterfly.  I learned about the basics of it like the breakevens and how it should be played when volatility is high when entering the trade and will be low while exiting (which is the case in earnings), on the optionsAlpha and SMB videos about iron butterfly. What I am not sure is, how big of an influence IV crush can be post earnings, on the trade and whether it will work in my favor.\n\nI am particularly looking at **LULU** earnings. The underlying is \\~230 and ATM options are 230C (9.02) and 230P (9.30) ie ATM straddle is **18.32**. MMM expects price movement to be **+-16.35**. I want to play even safer and open a trade with **+-20** OTM options ie a 210 put (2.04) and 250 call (1.99).  For the trade my total credit will then be, 9.02 + 9.30 - 2.04 - 1.99 = **14.29**. With lower breakeven of 230-14.29=**215.71** and upper breakeven of  230+14.29=**245.29**. \n\nCurrent volatility of the options involved in this play is in the range of \\~90%-99%.  Historical data on TOS shows that the IV has decreased by at least 20% 1 day after the results in last 5-6 earnings.  If I go to options calculator and enter the values, I get [this graph](http://opcalc.com/26W) for my P/L returns per value of underlying. What I want to confirm is whether these results actually make sense and i should expect similar returns, or IV will change returns **significantly** (ie will push breakevens even higher because of large credit received). I am more on the bullish side for LULU earnings and expecting the underlying to be around 245+ by options expiry. Opening a near ATM put spread will earn me around 1-1.5 in credit for near equal max loss which is a much simpler play. But I really want to understand what can possibly happen if I go with Iron Butterfly trade instead of the put spread and LULU ends up around 245-247. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this makes sense lol!", "id": "e90dpy", "created_utc": 1576029001.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 44, "comments": [{"body": "It’s a defined risk play so you know how much there is to lose thankfully", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Not exactly.
