Because of Audi's scale they may trust things like service times etc more.   \n3) Diversity. It's possible for the driving use cases you have, the Audi is sufficient. With all the Teslas on the road, the e-tron is differentiated so all the other features may not be a big deal.  \n\n\nI think from a hardware/tech perspective its hard to argue that Tesla doesn't have an engineering advantage (Sandy Munro has put out a lot to talk about how Tesla has leapfrogged folks on the main components for EVs).", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "The first two are obviously opinionated, which is fair. I don’t understand your third point, if the range on an etron is enough, why not get a model 3 which is cheaper?", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Right, so you can get a SR for half of what the etron costs. With that comes the Supercharging network which is still MILES better than the Electrify America network. Those theoretical speeds Audi is showing during their presentation are only valid if you can find a fast charger capable of outputting those speeds.\n\nFor example, let’s look at how long it takes to drive from LA to some popular destination in a Tesla vs the etron. I’m using LA in this case because it ranks highest in CO2 savings per Tesla’s app and it’s clearly a HUGE market for EVs. We can estimate the travel time using https://abetterrouteplanner.com for a ton of different cars - a very helpful tool for EV owners. This is the best I can do short of buying each of these cars and testing the real world drive time. I have found these estimates to be very accurate as the maps take into account temperature, elevation, precipitation, additional passenger weight, charging speed, etc. It’s very comprehensive.\n\nAssumptions used for route planning:\n- Starting charge: 100%\n- Charger Arrival Charge: 10%\n- Destination Arrival Charge: 10%\n- Reference Speed: 115% (no one actually drives the speed limit in CA so I’m estimating a 15% bump in speed on average)\n- Outside temperature of 75*\n- Unsure if the map has been updated with the 150kw charging speeds yet since those are still fairly new. This could increase the charging speed of the Teslas even further.\n\n \nLA to Las Vegas:\n- etron: 5:33 total trip duration | 83 min of charging\n- SR Model 3: 4:23 total trip duration | 43 min of charging\n- LR Model 3 (RWD): 3:49 total trip duration | 14 min of charging\n\nLA to SF:\n- etron: 8:07 total trip duration | 134 min of charging\n- SR Model 3: 6:31 total trip duration | 71 min of charging\n- LR Model 3 (RWD): 5:45 total trip duration | 31 min of charging\n\nLA to Phoenix:\n- etron: 8:32 total trip duration | 200 min of charging\n- SR Model 3: 6:35 total trip duration | 89 min of charging\n- LR Model 3 (RWD): 5:34 total trip duration | 39 min of charging\n\n\nClearly the etron takes longer to reach the destination compared to the SR Model 3, a car half as expensive. A lot of this difference comes down to the etron needing to drive slower to reach its destination (can’t go above 50mph, 60mph, etc) because increased speed means increased drag and the car is not designed to minimize drag. Another problem the etron runs into is that it constantly needs to charge to 95%+ in order to make it to the next charger and charging speed will slow as the battery fills. This is because the etron absolutely chews through its 90kwh battery due to lack of efficiency in design and motors. Lastly, the Electrify America charging network just isn’t anywhere as robust as Tesla’s. I was hoping VW would have this built out by now since the etron launch is right around the corner. Looks like those taking delivery of their etron in the near term will have to deal with 50kw chargers for most of the road trips they do because the high speed charging network for the etron just doesn’t exist yet.", "score": 17, "replies": []}, {"body": "The third one is also an opinion - I think there are luxury consumers who are willing to spend that amount of money because the e-tron is simply not a Tesla.

{"title": "Beyond Meat - Financials and their expanding future (Food for thought)", "selftext": "Beyond Meat (BYND) kicked their IPO off at 4.2B with 9.6m shares priced at $46. Shares have soared %162 percent since release, ending at $87.66 05/17/2019.\n\nCurrently, some 70 percent of the company’s revenues are generated by its flagship Beyond Burger patties. The company also sells imitation sausages and vegan ground beef. In 2018, some $50 million of Beyond Meat’s revenues came from retail sales, including at Amazon.com Inc’s Whole Foods Market and Kroger Co supermarkets, while some $37 million was generated at restaurants.\n\nBeyond Meat plans to expand to Europe and Asia in 2020. Currently, in Europe, meatless patties and sausage isn't a hype right now. I imagine sales and distribution to Europe would take a hit since adoption isn't as aggressive as the US.   \nNestle has already taken a stance in Europe, Germany, Netherlands, and Switzerland with its meat-free burger under Garden Gourmet. Nestle has its products in over 1,500 facilities, including McDonald's, which has monopolized the fast food industry.   \n\n\nBeyond Meat faces a ton of competition with Nestle in the lead of the market. It is operating in a highly competitive environment. The company is competing with other plant-based protein makers, including Boca Foods, Field Roast Grain Meat Co., Gardein, Impossible Foods, Lightlife, Morningstar Farms, and Tofurky. But it also views traditional meat companies as rivals, including such giants as Cargill, Hormel Foods Corp., JBS, Tyson Foods Inc. and WH Group , the owner of Smithfield.  \n\n\nWith companies that Beyond Meat is in connection with, there are no written contracts. Meaning that their products can end or change at any time, affecting sales drastically.   \nPeople have to realize, too, that they've been promoting their product with discounts (as any business would to expand) with $3 discount on a $6.29 burger. Pricing on this product at Target, Whole Foods, etc is $7.29 for 2 patties, while a standard 4 patty set is accessible for $4-5 at a Walmart.   \nDemand is a strong factor, and with this product, I believe the hype will slow down. They've made a good entrance into this industry, but a 5.2b market cap and shares priced at $87.66, I believe this is overpriced and a short-term high. 5% of Americans are vegetarians in the US. That alone creates a huge impact on Beyond Meat. Demand and a \"secret ingredient\" has to be there for a company to succeed. And in this case, demand is low and an \"Oh wow! This is really good!\" isn't there.  \n\n\nI'm a skeptic on this company.
