Naturally, I assumed it was temporary and that they would bounce back as they had done so many times before. But alas, the bad news seemed to roll in more steadily as time went on. Now I’m stuck with Tesla sitting at \\~$185 and left feeling like a total fool for trusting in them. \n\nAt this point, what do I do? Do I hold and ride it out, hoping for any sort of gain above $200, or dump in the fear that they will continue to drop for the foreseeable future? I know the odds of me making back that $115 a share drop are impossibly slim right now, but if I could even get a sliver back I’d take it. \n\nI'd love y'all's opinion", "id": "bv81ia", "created_utc": 1559312102.0, "score": 9, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 44, "comments": [{"body": "Why did you invested in Tesla the first place?
