You're chugging along great in the beginning, selling your weeklies. Pretty soon you find yourself up about 30% for the year, but you're only 4 months in from the start. All the while, the increased capital means you can sell more contracts. You're at a point where you think, \"I can stop now for the year and be up, cruise for the rest of the year by putting it all in long term bonds or cash\".

It's only weeklies and I can scan any spike in price to buy to close when I need.\" You decide to stick to it because the gravy train keeps on coming. Then one night, after the market closes, Jeff Bezos comes on to say he's made a bid to buy UPS with a mix of cash and stock, because they've figured out how to leverage AWS to improve brown's logistics and on top of that, the savings they'll get from having their own last mile delivery service will pay for the deal in 6 months. Early morning pre-market trade the next day is through the roof, before the options market opens. Your call is gaining not only intrinsic value because it's now in the money, but the spike in volatile makes it more expensive, IV is increasing and the delta is getting larger--lessen learned regarding the gamma exposure you have for the weeklies you sell. That one time wiped out the gains you had for the year and then some. You vow this was only a fluke and was just this stock, won't happen to XYZ, move on to the next, and again happy until it's not.
