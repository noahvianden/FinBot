In our perfect theoretical world, let us examine what happens during a hyperinflation ceteris paribus - a rapid and uncontrollable rise in the price of goods and services, or your currency notes start to lose value compared to real assets /purchasable items. A company in itself is worth *something* (think assets, property, human capital, information, you name it), and the reminding value is market sentiment (how good does the future prospects of the company look, how much can it sell, turn a profit). So almost in all of the cases, during hyperinflation the future prospects of the company diminish greatly, as people start to consume only bare necessities, and try to invest in physical, valuable assets. So following this setting with consumer buying habits, investor views, and companies, it could be concluded that the value of the 1% in the company shares will decline in relative terms (basically what YOU can BUY with the shares). So a very bad situation indeed...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConcerning your edit 2, Gold is one of the most held assets that are used as inflation hedges. If you (or any one) are interested, look at the trends at which rate CBs and countries are buying gold, and dumping the dollar! Russia and China are among the largest net hoarders of gold, which to me signals clearly the end of the USD global dominance.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Your assumption is that the company has \"assets\". In a hyperinflation, people will start scrutinizing companies based on physical value. \n\nFor example, if your company has stockpiles of cheese, your company should do well as inflation goes up because your stocks are backed by the cheese's value.\n\nNow if your company is say an ETF, ETFs are known or not known, to have a scheme of buy now and eventually buy the asset later. So when you buy a stock from an ETF, it may or may not be backed by anything. When people start asking the company for their assets back, that company will scramble to buy them and will not do well. They will have more in cash and not in assets, assets will rise in an inflation, then they would be too late to buy them.\n\nSo basically, it boils down to if the company has physical value stored somewhere. This why I love gold or silver mining stocks, they have lots of storage of precious metals. I also do commodities, like cotton, cheese, oil. These do great during a recession and counters inflation.\n\nThe other important factor is if your company is service oriented. Who are they providing the service for? If the inflation is happening to the us dollar, and they are targeting us consumers. That company would fall. Services would need to be increased to meet the inflation and the consumers will lose their savings.

A good example is \"Venezuelan deconsolidation\" cases (you can google them), where about 64 companies on the S&P500 were effectively forced to write down subsidiaries located in Venezuela to $0 value.\n\nYou are correct that if you own 1% of something, that percentage will not change due to hyperinflation (although the company could issue more shares to the public in order to capital raise to pay debts which could dilute some of your voting rights). However, the value of the company could become impacted which would affect your stock asset (i.e. the company's value drops and now your $100 share is only worth $10). \n\nWhile the company would retain the value of their hard assets, they may lose the ability to operate as a business thus impacting the value of the company even more than if their assets were impacted (stocks' values are heavily tied to potential for future value). In hyperinflation scenarios there are usually external forces which are at play. In most cases there is or will be heavy government regulation around currency exchange or moving currency across borders. This will result in the inability for companies to get cash to pay off their short term debts like salaries and wages or accounts payable. The government may alternatively step in and cease the company if it produces essential goods. Lastly, since currency has become nearly worthless raw materials, which may come internationally, will become scarce as no one has the ability to pay for them, they become hoarded, or the government applies regulations on them. Without the ability to get raw materials to function as a business, the business will be forced to cease operations. In my aforementioned case of Venezuela all of these things occurred and US companies were forced to pull out of Venezuela operations either via heavy discounted sales of their subsidiaries, or simply via writing them off and stopping. Venezuela is an extreme case, however deconsolidation started as early as 2015. Hyperinflation is not a common occurrence and is usually a catastrophe resulting in a total reset.
