A microecon prof. would look at him funny, and it's not like he doesn't know the classic def. (esp. since he's got an econ degree),  so, clearly, it's intentional.\n\nI think it's more informative to plumb Tesla and its various representatives' actions assuming some motivated intent of theirs.  In this instance he's working as salesperson of sorts (not unusual for a CEO) and putting positive spin on situation where demand is technically falling (at least by typical classical sense.)  It's only natural to expect them to downplay local/global demand fluctuations caused by numerous confounded factors (credit expiry, insufficient economies of scale, competitors coming, macro-economic weakening, [legitimate|illegitimate] bad-press, etc.)\n\nHe's more likely tailoring the language for media, retail investors, rather than possible economics wonks (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wonk)\n\nA more cynical perspective (and perhaps more palatable to certain audiences) is that it's simply a talking point developed to stay \"on message\" irrespective of definitions at play, or rather, intentional implicit definition [framing|funneling] --unflatteringly, look at it as perhaps a case of mild realpolitik public relations management. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik)\n\nEdit: typo a missing word & punctuation fixes.  \\*Also bear in mind: many companies are going to pick and choose {benchmarks, definitions, framing} that puts its products and position in best light; Tesla has history of doing so.

Tesla going to be motivated to strongly emphasize latent demand to try and take control or at least lay groundwork to steer any \"demand\" narrative that starts getting traction.  I'm guessing they will pound the drumbeat of latent demand for 3 and any other products until they're blue in the face when anyone brings up classic demand challenges.\n\nIt may come off as stupid to some analysts, but I don't think it's intrinsically stupid, and rather find it non-stupid (i.e., rational) tactical PR on Elon's part.  Whether it's effective is another story, but I don't really fault him for trying.\n\nDepends on which perspective you choose to measure stupidity from (analyst on call assessment vs. more generalized set or other set of audiences.)\n\nEdit: TL;DR added.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}
