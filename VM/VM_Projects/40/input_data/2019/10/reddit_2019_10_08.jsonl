He outlines how he can use futures to manipulate the underlying stock in either directions as a short or as a long.\n\nHe sums it up how easy it is to manipulate the stock price:\n\n> \"it's a fun game and it's a lucrative game and you you can move it up and then fade it\"\n\nIt is pretty clear in that interview that while the Apple example was hypothetical, he was talking from experience...\n\n90% of the TSLAQ scam is projection: they are accusing Elon of market manipulation because they are doing it, they are accusing Tesla of fraud because they are doing it, they are accusing Tesla bulls of running bots and brigading because they are doing it.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Pretty much hit the nail on the head.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "This one is my favorite in the thread:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/phoennix10/status/1166625776390868992?s=20\n\n> 13/Tesla no longer has the leadership, talent or skill to help train their new employees and get their factory ready for *real* production.\n\n> Everyone with any manufacturing experience on past vehicle launches have left.\n\nYet... they just produced 10% more cars than their previous record.", "score": 16, "replies": []}, {"body": "I’m selling all of my shares and going short now.
