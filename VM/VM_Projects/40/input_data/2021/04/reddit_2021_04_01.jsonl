{"title": "Gay bear warning: TSLA", "selftext": "Hey Guys. Before some you go crazy, I want to tell you that this is just for the reflection. I had a pretty good opinion about Tesla in 2019 but since Dec. 2019 the Company turned more and more into a cult. It sometimes fell like a religion.  I went relatively critical since Elon accelerate this cult excessively. I think this is very unethical and therefore I want to write down this and talk about things others don't like to talk about . This is a long Text but I put a lot information  and sources in it. And yes, I know there are some bias of me in it. Sorry for that! \n\nNeedless to say, few are expecting bubble symmetry to manifest now, because, \"this time it's different.\" Indeed. It's always different and yet always the same, too.\n\nLet's indulge in some basic logic:\n\n1. All speculative bubbles pop, regardless of source, time or place. (100% of all historical evidence supports this.)\n2. The current \"Everything Bubble\" is a speculative bubble. (Supported by Covid-Checks, QE and very high leverage)\n3. Therefore the current speculative bubble will pop.\n\nTbh we all also know that a gamma or theta squeeze can’t last forever, Vanguard Boomers also bought it via Index-Funds and and everybody (unless maybe ARK, Redlich, Gerber) knows Tesla is a bubble.\n\nElon just tells people what they want to hear, because no one seems to care if he can deliver what he promises or not. Remember Nikola? As soon as people started talking about it Elon literally be like: “Hey guys we’re building those things very soon too” (he then came around the corner with some design patterns). Tesla added new Semi jobs to Gigafactory 1, let’s see what will happen this year. On the 28th Jan call he was like “yes, we will build those thing this year maybe or maybe not but it is on hold until Tesla can make a high volume of its 4680 battery cells.” \\[1\\]\n\nTesla will (probably) deliver its first Semi by the end of 2021. The Semi program is more than two years behind its original schedule (2019).\\[2\\]\n\nBut According to a Tweet from Elon you will have to wait till 2022 before you can get one. \\[2A\\]\n\nInteresting is that LG announced that they hope to make 4680 large-format cylindrical cells for Tesla in 2023 in U.S. or Europe. But wasn’t TSLA supposed to build these in-house? \\[3\\] Why should LG invest in capacity when Tesla tries to build the worlds biggest battery manufacturing plant in Germany?\n\nNevertheless, no 4680 battery until 2023 means (at the current ate):\n\n· No Roadster\n\n· No Semi Truck\n\n· No $25K Car\n\nHe also announced that once Tesla begins high-volume production of its lithium-ion battery cells, the company will likely also develop an electric van and Musk also confirms new Tesla Roadster has been delayed to 2022. \\[4.\\]\n\nAnd why did he take over Maxwell Technologies Inc. while have contract with CATL, LG and Panasonic? They want to build some in Berlin (the world’s biggest battery factory to be honest) but it it's mostly rumors because there is sometimes a disconnection between Tesla plans and reality. \\[5\\] & \\[6\\]\n\nMaybe that’s the reason why LG Chem try to build them in 2023. Because again why should LG invest when Tesla could build them too?\n\nIn the meantime he talks about vertical integration (Mining Lithium in Nevada)  and Tesla also had found a way to extract it by using simple table salt.\\[7\\]. This needs a lot of R&D. And all this Technology with R&D expenses in the last 4 years that were between 1.35 and 1.45 Billion Dollar. In comparison GM spent quite consistently on R&D, averaging around $7.4 billion **per year** over the past 7 years. In the meantime, the spending of R&D to revenue is the same for both companies. \\[8\\]\n\nShort list of “Dinosaurs” and their 2021 announced EV Investment till 2025:\n\n**VW:**  **86 Billion $ \\[9\\]**\n\n**Daimler:**  **85 Billion $ \\[10\\]**\n\n**BMW:**  **32 Billion $ \\[11\\]**\n\n**Ford** **29 Billion $ \\[12\\]**\n\n**GM:**  **27 Billion $ \\[13\\]**\n\n**Hyundai:**  **17 Billion $ \\[14\\]**\n\nThat seems like a lot, if you use the higher end average Tesla will most likely invest up to 7.25 Billion Dollar in the next 5 years but plan to lead in various areas. Sounds not really realistic. But Tesla’s competitors also have decades of experience in:\n\n· Design\n\n· Production\n\n· Distribution\n\n· Sales\n\n· Post Sale Support (Service-Center Network, maintenance etc.)\n\nNext thing: Is the range of Tesla  really that good? Well Edmunds made a Test. Let’s see some results:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n||\n|:-|\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8z1hxglgdlq61.png?width=369&format=png&auto=webp&s=a28f4274f96b3240084ca78be91169d8a8494c43\n\n||||\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|||\n\n\\[15\\] So, on average they have a slightly longer range than the competition but aren’t that honest about the real range. Seems like Tesla focus more on EPA Standarts than real world range. They use a little trick. The EPA allows automakers the option to run three additional drive cycles and use those results to earn a more favorable adjustment factor. How it work you can read here \\[15A\\]. More about that here \\[15B\\] and here \\[15C\\].\n\nBut therefore, the quality of Tesla Cars is really good, right?\n\n  Well, J.D. Power Find 2021 test says otherwise. Tesla problems per 100 where 176 by an average of 121. Makes it place 30 out of 33. \\[16\\]\n\nAn often stated but no logical argument is that Tesla takes market share of the ICE Manufactures and it is too late for them. They often compare it with Nokia or Blackberry to Apple. But Why? Tesla is already losing market share to these “dinosaurs” especially in the EU (the largest EV market), and competition is only increasing.\n\nHere are my expected the future lines of defense. The next line of defense will be \"Tesla is a software company that will become the Windows equivalent to the auto industry\". Failing that, it will be \"Telsa is really an energy company and will dominate battery technology\". Then goes on to \"robo taxis\" and something about Mars or Teslacoin.\n\nThere is a nother Elephant in the room. Plug-in-hybrids also make a lot of sense. Small light battery for 90% of driving, and ICE engine for long trips. Makes lithium and cobalt supply much less of an issue. The move to pure BEV is worse for the environment (vs. PHEV). But nobody talks about it and I don’t want to go further about this topic. Fyi Plug-in EV sales in Europe were up 137% to 1.4 million vehicles last year. \\[17\\]\n\nBut let’s go back to Tesla. Remember the 1 Million robotaxis in 2021 or FSD? LoL could go on and on if you want.\n\nThe Robotaxis are very interesting. It was announced in April 2019 (when Tesla was short on Cash) when Musk [said](https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-tesla-elon-musk-autonomous-uber-lyft-20190422-story.html) 1 million fully autonomous robotaxis would be on the road by the end of 2020, making money for their owners. A few weeks later, Tesla sold $3 billion worth of Tesla stock, solving its cash crunch. By the end of 2020 not a single robotaxi had been built. The DMV emails suggest they won’t be anytime soon.\\[18\\]& \\[19\\]\n\nThere FSD is not true. Documents sent to officials in California in 2019 and in 2020 describe the extra-cost option as a Level [2](https://www.autoblog.com/polestar/2/) feature, meaning Full Self-Driving is certainly not fully driverless.\\[20\\]\n\nYou can compare TSLA FSD with Waymo (founded in 2009 as Googles Self-Driving Car Project) or Zoox and tell me more about how advance this company is. \\[21\\]\n\nCruise alone announced on Jan. 19 that they got a funding of around 2 Billion Dollars from Microsoft GM, Honda for self-driving vehicles. \\[22\\] (remember the 1.5 Billion R&D of Tesla for everything)\n\nWaymo chief John Krafcik doubts Tesla can offer autonomous driving to its customers and doesn't see Tesla as a competitor at all. “Only Waymo produces a fully autonomous driving system; Tesla, on the other hand, only a driving assistance system.” \"Tesla warns its drivers to make sure they keep their hands on the wheel at all times and reminds human drivers to control their cars at all times. Waymo steering wheels say: No touching.\" \\[23\\]\n\nBtw Waymo has been operating the world's first commercial robotic driving service in Phoenix since October 2020.\\[24\\]\n\nEven Intel is in this business with Mobileye. And according to Motortrend, a Cadillac Escalade with GM’s Super Cruise drives as well as a Tesla with Autopilot, and it’s safer, too. \\[25\\]\n\nTexas Lawyer warns that FSD capability is unsafe at any speed. \\[25A\\]\n\nAnd also Road and track describe FSD Beta as “Laughably Bad and Potentially Dangerous”. \\[25B\\]\n\nIn official correspondence with California’s Department of Motor Vehicles, Tesla lawyers recently admitted the $10,000 option that Tesla sells as Full Self-Driving Capability is not, in fact, capable of full self-driving. “Currently neither Autopilot nor FSD Capability is an autonomous system,” Tesla attorney Eric Williams said in a Dec. 28 letter to the DMV, although that could change, he added.\n\nIn other words: Either Tesla is lying to the CA DMV, or Elon Musk has been lying to everyone else for the past five years.\\[26\\]\n\nNow Tesla says \"Full Self-Driving\" software doesn't actually make cars autonomous.\n\nWhat really matters because the company is charging $10,000 extra for the (as we know now) not-really-self-driving, might-arrive-someday addition to its standard Autopilot adaptive cruise-control and lane-keeping feature and again Tesla is telling investors on the notion that its full self-driving tech will enable Teslas to become money-generating robotaxis.\\[27\\]\n\nIn the meantime, the National Transportation Safety Board has filed comments blasting the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration for its permissive regulation of driver-assistance systems. NTSB argues that NHTSA should require automakers to limit use of driver-assistance systems to the type of roads they're designed for. The NTSB mentions Tesla **16 times** in the report—far more than any other automaker. \\[28\\]\n\nThe main point on this issue is that he lied from the beginning, On January 24 in 2017 Tom Randall asked Musk on Twitter “At what point will “Full Self-Driving Capability” features noticeably depart from “Enhanced Autopilot” feature?\n\nMusk response on the same day at 4 a.m.: “ 3 months maybe, 6 months definitely”\n\nBut he did it also official. he announced \\[…\\] introduce autonomous technology by this summer. The technology would allow drivers to have their cars take control on what he called “major roads” like highways.\n\nGuess when he said that. It was in March 2015!  \\[29\\]\n\nHere is a Video which (you all probably know) combines a lot of the FSD narratives: \\[[https://www.veoh.com/watch/v142103958tzjgSYSk\\]](https://www.veoh.com/watch/v142103958tzjgSYSk])\n\nWe as humans are lazy in thinking (evolutionary). Therefore, we love simple concepts or narratives that sound coherent (but do not necessarily have to be).\n\nMusk's main narrative is that he can shake up any industry (auto, rockets, tunneling, solar) and go into all areas for vertical (batteries, mining, etc.) and horizontal integration (robotaxis, insurance, etc.).\n\nIn January he talked about gas drilling for SpaceX. How absurd is this? \\[30\\]\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if Elon told us that Tesla is starting to produce fake meat or crypto and connected this with nuclear/solar energy because they have a \"new techlonogy\", it doesn’t even matter if this is part of a whole concept or not.\n\nSo, we sometimes tend to act and think contrary to the evidence when it comes to narratives.\n\nWith Elon, we have another effect that reinforces the whole thing. I'll try an analogy, which in my view is partly the foundation for bubbles. I'll call it the effect of \"The religious leader in the desert\".\n\nImagine you are following your leader through the desert. You have the feeling that he already knows what he is doing and you follow him. You don't really understand it yourself, but you believe that the leader already knows what he is doing because he is the religious leader (and therefore always right).\n\nImagine he stops and says that he made a mistake and got lost and now has to go back all 100 miles and then turn into another direction. At that moment you would realize that he obviously doesn't know what he is doing and you won't follow him anymore.\n\nNow you have the situation that a person who is connected to a theory from his way of life can no longer deviate from his narrative from a certain point on.\n\nIf someone does this, however, he has destroyed his career and his life path, so to speak, because he is connected to the narrative. So, if someone has taken a wrong turn and it is relatively costly for him and those around him, he can no longer admit that the narrative is wrong, even if he should see the evidence against his narrative.\n\nIt is similar in science. Theories do not change gradually, but all at once. There is a main theory that everyone pays attention to and a parallel second theory that has little influence, until the evidence of the second theory becomes too strong and the old theory can no longer be maintained, the system collapses (or in stock market case the bubble bursts).\n\nGo on Twitter and ask Elon if his cars will be flying soon. He will reply that that’s a future option and they are already working on it. The same with the vacancies, tunnels and so on. It is not just PR, It is necessary for him to keep the narrative alive.\n\nRemember when Musk wanted to make ventilator because of covid?? He tweeted (March 25): *“Giga New York will reopen for ventilator production as soon as humanly possible. We will do anything in our power to help the citizens of New York”*. So far I found out, almost no ventilators were made. \\[30A\\]\n\nAnother funny thing from October 2018: *“Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America & realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.”* And “*Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year* (he means end 2019)*“* \\[30B\\]\n\nThose were the things I made an U-turn in my opinion on investing in Tesla. This is a castle in the air with a high probability that it is really only hot air without any substance. There is no difference between an official Tesla statement and a tweet from Elon Musk as CEO and biggest shareholder.\n\nBut how’s Business going?\n\nDespite 5 price cuts in China in 2020, TSLA's BEV market share fell from \\~20% to \\~11.6%.\\[31\\]\n\nShare of 30.44% of the European BEV market in 2019 and 13.19% in 2020. Even with price cuts…\\[32\\]\n\nAnd Fremont, which ran at less than 80% of capacity, is the source of cars for Europe. So why does he need Berlin?\n\nWhy less thann80%? Tesla sold about 180K cars in 4Q 2020\\[33\\]. About 65K of these cars were built in Shanghai leaving around 115K from Fremont. Tesla says that Fremont can produce 590K per year or 147.5K per quarter -> 115/147,5 = 0,78 = 78%. \\[34\\]\n\nBEV growth rates in 2020 YoY\n\nTesla 36.2% (+ 55,9% in Germany)\n\nVW 197% (+608,6 % in Germany)\\[35\\]\n\n20Q4 BEV sales\n\nTSLA 180k (worldwide) \\[37\\]\n\nVW \\~134k (in Europe and the US)\n\nVW alone sold also 422,100 Plug-In Electric Cars in 2020 \\[36\\]\n\nAnd that’s Europe EV sales in 2020 with 43 % growth for full year 2020 \\[38\\], in a vehicle market which has declined by 37 %. Revenues of Tesla could growth but I tell you a secret. When you growth but less than the market -> not good!!\n\nQ4/20 market share of Tesla in Europe was 10.2% (\\~33% in Q4/19), lowest since 2013 (when first Model S deliveries). \\[38A\\] Massive competition coming this year. 13 new EV Models alone from VW Group in China. -> Co2 Credit will go away -> negative CF….\n\nBut why you should cut your prices when your competition is not even remotely close to your quality and at the same time you have high growth?\n\nAccording to electrek, here are what some of the changes look like. In Germany, for instance (Jan. 2021): \\[39\\]\n\nModel 3 Standard Range Plus: from €42.990 to €39.990\n\nModel 3 Lang Range AWD: from €52.490 to €49.990\n\nModel 3 Performance: from €58.490 to €54.990\n\nTesla in Germany cut prices for m3 SR+ in 2020 total:\n\nFeb. 2020: 45.370 €\n\nSept. 2020: 43.990 €\n\nOkt. 2020: 42.900 €\n\nJan. 2021 as mentioned: 39.990€\n\nElectrek correctly notes: \"In Europe, things are starting to change as legacy automakers are starting to release new higher-volume electric vehicle programs and focusing deliveries in Europe, where regulations are forcing automakers to deliver a higher mix of electric vehicles. Tesla still has strong deliveries in Europe, but it is losing EV market shares to many other automakers.\"\n\nUpdate Feb. 17 also from Electrek Price Cuts in USA: \\[40\\]\n\nTesla Model 3 Prices were cut at the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020 an now back as they was before\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tesla Model 3 Standard      Range Plus: price went from $37,490 to $37,990\n* Tesla Model 3 Long      Range AWD: price went from $46,490 to $46,990\n* Tesla Model 3      Performance: price went from $55,990\n\nI don’t know why. Maybe because of the 25th of February Bloomberg announced that Tesla temporarily halt the production at Model 3 Line in Fremont. Yeah, can happen sometimes. But cutting the price and then stopping the production (they knew it before) for two weeks (Feb 22 to March 7)? Sounds not like high demand to me. Maybe that’s the reason the price of Model 3 went a little bit up but not of Model Y.\n\n## Tesla Model Y Prices\n\nMost notably, Tesla has reduced the price of the Model Y Standard Range by $2,000 to now $39,990. That’s a significant price reduction for a vehicle **that was introduced just a month ago!!!** ([Model Y with Standard Range RWD and 7-seat third-row option](https://electrek.co/2021/01/07/tesla-model-y-standard-range-rwd-third-row-option/))\n\nHere are the price differences for all 3 trims of the Model Y:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Tesla Model Y Standard Range – now: $39,990 –      was: $41,990\n* Tesla Model Y Long Range (AWD) – now: $48,000 –      was: $49,990\n* Tesla Model Y Performance (AWD) – now: $60,990 –      was: $59,990\n\nSo, fourth price cut this year from Tesla. It was only mid-February and they are building two more factories to sell the same models. In which world does this make sense?\n\nOkay, maybe because of that, they have the by far biggest market share. Europe's share of global EV sales doubled to 43% last year, while at the same time China and the U.S. saw market share decline. More info \\[41\\]\n\nSo, let’s look what happened in Europe in till first April 2021.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|||\n|:-|:-|\n\n\n[source: https:\\/\\/www.ev-volumes.com\\/  maybe not 100&#37; but good estimate](https://preview.redd.it/9qdhluemdlq61.png?width=605&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b815a985bb22e0902c24a81b7346f2a7ca8c4cc)\n\n||||\n|:-|:-|:-|\n||\n\nIrland Share: 10% (5th place) und in Sweden 6,7% (6th place). There are no orders contribute but it seems that 6 ships will come from Fremont and 2 from China to Europe. Compares to 7 in 20Q1. If I’m wrong please inform me.\n\n**Korea** looks also pretty bad: Model 3 was the most popular EV in Korea in 2019 but saw its sales plummet from 1,524 vehicles in January and February last year to just 15 in the same period this year. \\[41A\\]\n\nAnd honestly, how the fuck are their reported margins increasing despite 14 price cuts in the last 13 months (**Feb price cuts not include**) totaling more than 10%-15% across the board? Are they capitalizing expense Wordcom style?\n\nI mean really, can someone explain this to me?\n\nTesla has made major prices cuts in every single quarter since Q4 '19. This is done to fake (my opinion) the appearance of growth. There is no way to stop the price cutting, as volumes actually shrink when they do. Cutting their lowest margin product by 7%, again, in the EU is significant.\n\nSo, Tesla keeps cutting prices while being supply constrained, something doesn't fit here.\n\nAnd in Tesla home state California?\n\n$TSLA cars registered in California past 3 years:\n\n2018 - 70,300 units\n\n2019 - 72,600 units\n\n2020 - 71,300 units\n\nMercedes/Daimler expects to have met the CO2 limits with its new cars sold in 2020. Others will follow this year…-> Co2 Credit will go away -> Tesla will have negative CF as always….\n\nAll carmakers are willing to sell as many EVs as possible to avoid the Co2 Credit. I found leasing offers for the Renault Kangoo Z.E for under 20 euros per month in Germany. EV are incredibly cheap.\n\nSum Up 2020\n\nTesla ended 2020 with 0.78% global passenger vehicle sales share and 15.4% global EV sales share, despite \"record sales\" (and a barely detectable profit, mainly by selling regulatory credits).\\[42\\] 99.2% of car buyers didn't buy a Tesla and 84.6% of EV buyers didn't either.\n\nFyi:\n\n**VW ID.4 Crozz China prices & range just announced (Jan. 2021): \\[43\\]**\n\nPURE: $30,850 (400 Km)\n\nPURE+: $33,937 (550 Km)\n\nPRO: $37,023 (550 Km)\n\nPRIME: $37,484 (550 Km)\n\n**Tesla Model 3 (Jan)**: $38,567 (468 Km)\n\nTesla is entertaining. But they are infants next to VW. You can now buy a Porsche Taycan in the US for under $80,000. \\[44\\] So, you are paying $10k over a Model S for\n\n· Porsche brand, service and parts availability, build quality, reliability and feel\n\n· One motor less\n\n· Maybe a few miles (but not EPA miles) shorter range, faster charge\n\n· OTA, HUD and led matrix headlights\n\nModel S since a very successful year of 2017 it is now a shopkeeper (okay it’s 8 years old but do you think the new one will really attract more?). I think it will get murder this year by Porsche and Audi. And I also think the (real) range of Model S will be longer than the Taycan but if you have to choose in 100k plus $ cars you will probably weight a brand name like Porsche more. But it seems you have to wait till mid 2022 according to Tesla. \\[45\\]\n\nBut wait to the April 15 debut of the EQS with a range of more than 700 km (435 miles). \\[45A\\]\n\nAlso interesting that the other companies don’t have to build new plant for EVs.\n\n“We boosted flexibility of all factories worldwide so that we can produce hybrids, fully electric cars and combustion vehicles everywhere, depending on customer demand and individual market developments,” Schaefer said. “It took a while for us to prepare all this, but now it’s time to deliver.” \\[45A\\]\n\nFun fact:\n\nThe estimates for Tesla's EPS in fiscal years 2022 and 2023 given at the beginning of 2019 were higher than they are now. In other words, in 2019, Tesla's EPS for 2022 and 2023 was expected to be higher than it is now - and that's despite the fact that Tesla has grown significantly in the meantime, opened new factories and seen its share price rise sharply. Best example is ARK, their new estimate deliveries in 2021 are 17% lower then their original model published in 2019.\n\nYou also shouldn’t forget that Tesla was almost dead (According to a Twitter statement of Elon) in 2019 (Stock around 35€ in June) and a lot of analyst thought that too. \\[46\\]  But bro, you have to look to 2030! But why did nobody look to 2030 2 years ago? Simple, people who owned shares became greedy and start to develop those strange theories. It’s like they think in 5 years there is only Tesla and every other automaker will close its doors. (look at ARKs new 2025 estimate, in this (intrinsic) Tesla will also beat Lyft, Uber and almost the Car Insurance with 40 % Gross Margin.)\n\nARK Models -> {[https://github.com/ARKInvest/ARK-Invest-Tesla-Valuation-Model](https://github.com/ARKInvest/ARK-Invest-Tesla-Valuation-Model) }\n\nYou also should note, that the 3.000$ are without any energy, solar, battery sale and only 50% FSD. So it seems that ARKs 2025 goal is way undervalued.\n\nAnd everything seems to boost in a recession.\n\nThe recession is bizarrely. In a year when 11 million more people were unemployed, we had the largest increase in personal income in 20yrs during an economic downturn, due to massive policy support. The CARES Act (January 24, 2020) added trillions in fiscal stimulus.\n\nHow big was it? In three months in 2020 the increased the deficit more than the past 5 recessions combined (1973, 1975, 1982, the early 90s', the dot com bust and the GFC ‘08). The Fed in 6 weeks bought also more treasuries than in 10yrs under Bernanke and Yellen. Corporate borrowing, which almost always goes down in a recession, which had already increased from $6trln to $10trln going into the crisis due to the Fed’s free-money policies, went up $400bln. In comparison, it went down by $500bn during the GFC ‘08. Why I’m telling you that? Well, it’s just a warning that we are in a ridiculous time.\n\nLast but not least: the current state of 2021:\n\n· European deliveries -10%\n\n· GigaBerlin facing massive delays and cost are at around 5.8 Billion Euros (around 6.95 Bil $) \\[[https://www.rbb24.de/studiofrankfurt/wirtschaft/tesla/2021/03/tesla-gruenheide-sechs-milliarden-ivestition-wasser-trinkwasser-versorgung.html\\]](https://www.rbb24.de/studiofrankfurt/wirtschaft/tesla/2021/03/tesla-gruenheide-sechs-milliarden-ivestition-wasser-trinkwasser-versorgung.html])\n\n· USA revenue still below Q4 2018 peak\n\n· China regulators enforcing the law\n\nSolution -> I KNOW! LET'S BUY BITCOIN!!!!\n\nIn other words: Tesla couldn’t think of anything like car design, batteries, manufacturing, autonomous-driving software, vehicle-charging infrastructure related to its actual business that could have benefited from $1.5 billion in investment? Go ahead and look again at the R&D and CapEx spending.\n\nTesla sold its own stock to buy Bitcoin. What does that tell you about management's thoughts on Tesla's share price and shareholders? Or where are the 1.5 billion from? Well yeah, the carbon credits….\n\nTSLA has around 1.1 billion shares outstanding (Feb. 2021). It bought $1.5B of Bitcoin. If the value of that Bitcoin DOUBLES, Tesla's profit is $1.36/share. The stock rallied around $20/share on the news (short-term). Do you get it how insane is this?\n\nThis is an intangible that can only be marked down, as long as it is carried. Should not only me raise eyebrows. Main question is why and why now?\n\nA very quick look at Teslas reported numbers quickly deteriorating operating trends with a declining market share, a 25% EPS miss and a lack of revenue guidance.\n\nDiversification of cash means in this case significantly increased downside earnings volatility. The Capital allocation contradicting company’s business model.

An average gain of 0.13% per day would result in the same end result. Neither of these scenario are likely to happen as it is impossible for stock price to move consistently in one direction whether it is dollar gain or percentage gain. This is how it would look like for the both scenarios (broken down in six month intervals).\n\n|Date|Projected Price (Fixed $ gain)|Projected Price (Fixed % gain)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|July 1, 2021|$883.33|$745.69|\n|January 1, 2022|$1,331.35|$949.34|\n|July 1, 2022|$1,772.07|$1,203.87|\n|January 1, 2023|$2,220.09|$1,532.66|\n|July 1, 2023|$2,660.80|$1,943.58|\n|January 1, 2024|$3,108.83|$2,474.39|\n|July 1, 2024|$3,551.98|$3,141.91|\n|January 1, 2025|$4,000.00|$4,000.00|\n\nWe know that TSLA is a highly volatile stock, so it is unlikely to move like this. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see where TSLA ends up at the end of each six month (or even three month) period. I am planning on using my spreadsheet as a rough guideline to determine if we stay on target or not. Another use is to determine which strike and expiry to grab. If there is any interest, I can post updates and details of any shares/calls I end up buying.\n\nMy positions\n\n* 41 shares.\n* 2x $700c 4/9e.\n\nAs always, please do your own DD.
