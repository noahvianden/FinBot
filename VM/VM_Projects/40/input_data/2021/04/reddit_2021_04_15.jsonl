{"title": "Theta Gains Progress !!", "selftext": "My progress since I joined the Thetagang.  I started Theta gang after loosing 20k in WSB style. Not proud of it lol.  Started my trading journey in 2018 and thought making money is so easy just buy calls. Couldn't be so wrong. Lost around 12k in that Dec period. Stayed away from market for a year returned in late 2019 and was doing good but lost another 6K during Covid time. After that I started running Wheel and learnt about different strategies then started PMCC and recently when tech rebounded I started PCS. I use all my gains to buy long term stocks that I keep in another broker. My portfolio is bit tech heavy.\n\nSo far what I have learnt :\n\nFamiliarize yourself with the Greeks and IV. They are super important.\n\n**Wheel:**\n\n1. Go with the stocks you can hold long term with Delta and DTE depending on your risk appetite(The classical way). If you get 10-20% in first couple of days just close it and move to next.\n2. I use Barchart to find high stocks IV and sometimes sell puts on stocks that has recently seen a spike in IV. It's more like a r/VegaGang type play where I look for inflated IV. You can play ER as well I haven't tried it yet.\n3. Avoid Meme stock to wheel. Like NIO, SPCE etc coz when they rise they go like crazy and you will miss that run.  If you do, Don't wait for them to hit 50%. You see some gain like 20-25% close the position. I have wheeled TQQQ, SPXL like them.\n\n**PMCC:**\n\n1. Have a fix amount of money you want to run PMCC on. Don't put everything on PMCC.\n2. Selling CC is completely depends on conditions.  If you are expecting an upward trend avoid selling CC or go with 0.20 or less or long/short DTE. There is no fix way to decide how to sell them. I got burnt out on my longs in Feb when tech went into correction. I didn't sold my calls properly. This is something I am still working on.  I sell some weekly CC and some 2-3 weeks out. Depending on the ticker.\n3. Avoid Meme stocks like SPCE, PLTR. They will rise up one day and you will loose all the gains you have made. If you really want to buy leaps atleast 1-2 years away and sell CC. of around 0.20 or less delta 30-45 DTE.\n4. Have patience. You don't need to sell CC on every 100 stock you own or against every Long call. It's okay sometimes not to sell a call especially on a red day unless you going for 30-45 DTE on some non -growth stock.\n5. Mostly go with ETFs  risks of blowing up is less. You keep some established individual tickers like AAPL, MSFT that wont go like 20% in a single day.\n6. Buy the Long call as far as you can. There is very less difference in prices as you further so better get the farthest available call. Again choosing delta is upto you. I go for like 3 - 4 strikes down. It‚Äôs also comes with  tax advantage.\n7. Diversify the sectors.\n\nEdit: \n8. If your short call blows up just close the whole trade rather then buying back the short call. In this way you will close the trade with a profit. \n&#x200B;\n\n**Some other strategies that I used:**\nKeep an eye for good stocks that has recently took a dip without any big change in fundamentals and buy a long call. I got INTC, CRM and IBM like that. Avoid running PMCC on those. When they recover they recover fast or run it very conservatively.\n\nI also Buy a small portion of Tqqq. I always buy 1-2 shares of that whenever it dips 5 %.\n\nBuy super long calls of meme stocks like RKT, PLTR, SPCE. I got burned enough to realize it's not worth it. They are better with a long call. Whenever they go up I just sell.\n\n**Next plan:**\n\n1. I need to work better on my CC strategies. This recent correction showed how vulnerable I was so I need to do better in that area.\n2. I started PCS and ICs on various ETFs recently. My plan is to open PCS and IC's only on Indexs or Etfs and allocate a small portion of my portfolio.\n3. Get familiar more about the technical indicators and actually start using them.\n4. Once the Tech ER season is over I am going to run multiple PMCCs only on EFTs and very selected tickers and sell multiple CCs (some weekly, some 30-45 DTE). Right now have a lot of tickers.\n5. Reduce the size of account. I will put more money into long term stocks and wheel more stocks. I  moved to a More aggressive side but now I wana calm down.\n\nFeel free to criticize my strategies. Happy trading guys.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m1y82vb2uet61.jpg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc7425b2024e9de12d1ebc2a20444419a9822551", "id": "mrpa15", "created_utc": 1618524258.0, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 42, "comments": [{"body": "Avoiding meme stocks will make your life much easier.
