It looks like they are trying to sell the shares off market to not affect the stock price adversely.

[KKR Portfolio | KKR](https://www.kkr.com/businesses/kkr-portfolio)\n\n04/11 update... Just want to say I have reviewed the open interest in GME and my put spread will be exited early in the week. I believe in this: Move it lower, stir emotions, sell more puts,  close it around $170 at end of week and simply crush all those emotional options buyers.  The OI of puts $170 strike and lower is ridiculous against the call volumes. A big imbalance like this gives those that control the market a big incentive to park this GME around $170 at end of week. Of course, I can be wrong! However, I'm not greedy and am risk adverse. So, this idea makes most sense to me so I'm going to take profits on this put spread and then just watch the stock or day trade it the remainder of the week.\n\n04/12 TOOK OFF MY GME PUT SPREAD ... CHA CHING .. more than a double here. ASO ... again.. I'm going to sit on this for the retail numbers.  When I see GME -10% and see ASO holding up here .. feeling right about this call. My other play was a Put spread in RCL which I just cashed and I'm holding this put spread x 2 bought late last week .. MAR $148 , $138 spread and short shares at $147.97 ... Looking for a sub $146 print. MAR has been really trading light volume. The only way I think the volume is going to pick up is that the stock gets re-priced soon.\n\nFor short term price action uber-bullish I watch the 15 minute 13 period RSI for a print and hold of 69 mark.  It's always a sexy move it can hold 69. ASO just printed 68.82 on this indicator 9:27am. 12:11pm Now, 4th hit at this $31.70 level with a nice low volume draw down. $32.25 is a very key level and it is not far away. Higher high in price , Higher high in the RSI ... this feels explosive.\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "mnq6er", "created_utc": 1618000821.0, "score": 15, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 40, "comments": [{"body": "One thing I did not note.

Wanted to share some different dimensions of vols. If you're looking to collect theta on any of these names, hopefully these visuals can guide you towards the juicier strikes, and steer you away from the lower vol strikes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**VIAC**\n\nAs some earlier threads mentioned, VIAC upside options are extremely expensive. Here's a visual of the Apr 23 strike vols, compared to Sep:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VIAC Skews](https://preview.redd.it/guh6evnut6s61.png?width=1360&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c5b91525434d1f98794cee18045dc5af40f6cf8)\n\nIt might be tempting to catch a falling knife with a pillow by selling downside VIAC puts, but keep in mind that customers have been doing this for a while, depressing lower strike vols. Additionally, buy-the-dippers have been loading up on upside calls, hoping for a bounce back.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**PLTR**\n\n[PLTR June and Jan skews](https://preview.redd.it/wmxs2sx8u6s61.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4465b47b78bd08747a2e8546d0babc57e7c6175)\n\nNothing tooo crazy in PLTR, call skews have been juiced for a while, came back down in the backs ([sold it a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/m75u11/capitalize\\_on\\_high\\_pltr\\_call\\_skew\\_collect\\_decay), will have a trade update on this one!). and has rallied a bit recently in the fronts in anticipation of the Double Click event next week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ARKK Skews**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ARKK June and Jan Skews](https://preview.redd.it/h60xco9su6s61.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=5faadc7b7bf167168baa748f8b71f35b89b54e4c)\n\nARKK isn't one I've followed for a while. But it was interesting to see that ARKK has the cheapest upside calls. For correlation reasons, ARKK should have cheaper calls / more expensive puts than the average of its holdings. Either way, ARKK upside calls *seem* cheap, but its tough to quantify this without some more info on implied correlations. Maybe this is something I can keep track of in the future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TSLA**\n\nNow, the juicy one.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[TSLA June and Jan Skews](https://preview.redd.it/fnhhfff4v6s61.png?width=1346&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ea65d0c171000be1756352dc32ef4b3e0cfc06a)\n\nTSLA June 800-1000 strike are continues to be extremely depressed, as institutional sellers have been pounding this area.
