{"title": "2 years options experience. Read several articles. Still confused about Wash Sale rules", "selftext": "\\*Disclaimer\\* The primary goal of this post is to determine what the limitations are in regards to credit spreads & avoiding a Wash Sale situation. This strategy is not for everyone and \"just don't use credit spreads\" is not helpful feedback. With that out of the way..  \n\n\nLets talk about why there are exceptions to the 30 day Wash sale rule.  \nThe basics are that, if you buy a stock or option, and sell it for a loss within 30 days of that purchases, the loss will be disallowed as a Wash Sale.  \nWhen selling short options, buying it back within 30 days at a loss also constitutes a Wash Sale.\n\nHowever, there are instances with both stocks and options where that hasn't been the case.   \nMost recently, I bought 100 shares of KMI on 04/09 and sold 99 of them 11 days later for a loss and didn't trigger a Wash sale.\n\nOn the option side.. I bought CCI long puts on 2/16 and sold them on 3/19 and the entire thing was a wash sale (I forgot February was a shortened month =/)  \nBut then that same month I bought NVDA calls on 3/05 and sold them on 3/12 for a loss and didn't trigger a wash sale.\n\n\\*\\*Why this is important\\*\\* In regards to credit spreads, both legs experience time decay out of the money, constituting a gain on the short option and a loss on the long option.  \nAfter a move in the underlying security representing an 80% decay, I'd like to close the position and move on. However, realizing a gain on the short leg but having a wash sale on the long leg completely invalidates an otherwise profitable strategy.\n\nI want to understand why this only occurs some of the time. Whether it is possible to trade short dated spreads without triggering a Wash Sale. Or if because of the ambiguity, one should always aim to allow for 30 days between opening and closing.  \n\n\n\\--Currently what I am doing is realizing a gain on the short leg, since that can be done at any time, and holding the long leg either 30 days or into expiration.   \nThere is a subsection of Wash Sale that says the disallowed loss can be added to the cost basis of a remaining position. Which means in theory.. I could do a partial sale of the long option earlier & realize the full loss selling after 30/expiring the remaining ones. Without full understanding though, risking running afoul of Wash sale would mean thousands in taxable gains I never actually had. So, worst case.  \n\n\nThank you for reading, and I greatly value any insights or experience on this.", "id": "mvqzp8", "created_utc": 1619043683.0, "score": 3, "upvote_ratio": 1.0, "num_comments": 40, "comments": [{"body": "Looking at KMI, as an example. \n\nBuy, then sell = loss\nBuy less than 30 days after loss = wash \n\nIf you didn‚Äôt re-purchase the shares within 30 days of selling them, then you can claim the loss this year \n\nIf you bought them within 30 days of the sale, then the cost basis of the new lot is adjusted by the loss that you would have taken previously. \n\nIt will only matter when you carry those new shares into subsequent years, where it will take until the time of sale to claim those losses.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "This \\^", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "If I buy 1 option x for $100 and sell it for $50.

Their main revenue driver is cable television and everybody is cutting the cord these days so this is a shrinking segment, this does pose a risk to their recurring revenue. However they have another valuable asset that will help them offset this risk, and that is live sports. Although cable TV is shrinking, sports is definitely not and VIAC has many contracts and rights to stream live sports on their Paramount + service. None of the top 3 streaming services I mentioned does live sports streaming, and I‚Äôm sure they would love to add live sports on their library of contents. Their only competitor in the live sports segment FUBO. I do not perceive FUBO as a threat yet as they‚Äôre extremely overvalued and the business is losing money and has a lot of catching up to do. Even if FUBO is acquired before VIAC does, the acquisition of FUBO will force the other large streaming service to try and acquire their own to compete.\n\n**The Valuation:**\n\nI will present you with 3 different valuation all of them assume Paramount + is a flop and does not take off so I assume zero growth on their streaming service.   \n\nScenario one: Bullcase, I assume they will grow their total revenue by 3-5% for the next 5 year.  \n[Revenue Estimates](https://imgur.com/78x276u).  \n[DCF Valuation](https://imgur.com/s6TOmhj)\n\nScenario two: Bearcase, I assume their total revenue will be shrinking by  (-) 7-3%.  \n[Revenue Calculations](https://imgur.com/JUWIXuz).  \n[DCF Valuation](https://imgur.com/gra7R5E).  \n\nScenario three: I used an old school valuation method to value the business, Earning Power Value (EPV). In the EPV method it takes away the requirement for trying to predict the future and only takes into account the present business earning power. This method of valuation assumes no growth to the business. This method of valuation is a good valuation metric for valuing mature non growing businesses.   \n[EPV Valuation](https://imgur.com/un2fh7u)\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nEven in a declining environment VIAC is still fairly valued at **$37.83**.  \nAnd in a bullish environment VIAC is fairly valued at **$65.26**.  \nAnd based on the EPV valuation it is a woapping **$86.23**. \n\nThis is not financial advice.
