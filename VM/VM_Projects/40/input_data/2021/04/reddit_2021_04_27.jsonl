{"title": "The Psychedelic Renaissance: A Case for $MNMD", "selftext": "The name of the company: **MindMedicine**.\n\nAll of this isn‚Äôt financial advice. I strongly recommend reading the whole post but if you're lazy there is a TL;DR at the bottom.\n\n*About the company*\n\nThe goal of this company (and sector) is to revolutionize mental healthcare. How do they want to do this? MindMed focuses on different psychedelic drugs including Psilocybin, LSD, DMT and the Ibogaine derivative 18-MC (18-MC has huge potential in opioid withdrawal therapy and doesn‚Äôt have the side effects of Ibogaine). These drugs are currently being tested in numerous trials to ensure that the treatment methods are effective and safe, but everyone that has ever taken any kind of psychedelics knows about the immense potential which these kind of drugs have. The drugs address all kinds of mental health problems including Depression, PTSD, Anxiety and Addiction. And not one of these mental health problems is becoming less common, Corona and shit makes our mental health even worse by the day.\n\nAre there effective drugs already on the market to treat these diseases? Not really, instead opioid addictions are growing faster than ever and there is no real solution - apart from psychedelics. To make the treatment as individual as possible MNMD has a project called \"Albert\" where they work with AI/machine learning, this is really a big factor because they are already getting all the data they need from the trials. The CEO himself has said that this is a company equally specialized in technology and in pharma. He called MindMed the ‚ÄûTesla of Mental Health‚Äú, I think this describes MindMed best. The company also has a crazy good [team](https://mindmed.co/team/), they got ex Google and Pfizer employees.\n\n*Previous Research*\n\nPsychedelics in the mental health sector are not a completely new idea, this topic has been researched a lot in the 1950‚Äôs and 1960‚Äôs. There are a lot of studies from that time indicating the [positive effects](https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2014/sep/02/psychedelic-psychiatry) of these drugs in patients with different mental health disorders. But because of the Criminalisation of psychedelics in the western world beginning in the 1960‚Äôs, this topic was not picked up by researchers until the 1990‚Äôs. Since then multiple studies have been made and are currently happening.\n\nRecent studies have shown that low doses of psilocybin are as effective as the industry standard SSRIs!\n\n[Effects of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy on Major Depressive Disorder](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33146667/)\n\n[Trial of Psilocybin versus Escitalopram for Depression](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2032994)\n\n[Effects of psychedelics on the brain](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211124718307551)\n\n[Ibogaine and MindMed¬¥s derivative 18-MC](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03404-z)\n\n[Effects of MDMA-assisted therapy](https://maps.org/research/mdma/ptsd/phase3)\n\n*Financials*\n\nOkay the drugs are great blabla, what about the financials tho? How can they afford these incredibly expensive trials? The answer: they got a ton of cash from previous offerings, the latest number i could find was [$161](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mindmed-announces-2020-year-end-financial-results-current-cash-balance-of-161-million-usd-203-million-cad-to-support-drug-development-pipeline-and-creation-of-psychedelic-medicine-tech-platform-301258180.html) Mio USD. This will finance the company in the coming years. Will they have to raise more money eventually? Maybe, but right now they are good. As soon as the first drugs get approved, this company will make *a lot* of money, not because they are exploitative but because the market for mental health disorders is huge (it‚Äôs about [$20 billion](https://mindmed.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/MindMed-Corporate-Presentation-4.12.2021.pdf) right now and this number is growing rapidly).\n\n*Competition*\n\nOkay all looking beautiful, but what about the competition? What if MNMD just isn't the company that is developing the best product for the market? Let me put it this way; Mind Medicine is the undisputed leader in this emerging sector right now. The second biggest player (looking at MarketCap, trials and cash available) is Compass Pathways. There are many reasons why I personally would not invest in this company; first of all they have much fewer trials going on. If I'm already investing in a very risky company, I want to choose the one that is most likely going to succeed. And in the pharma industry you can lower that risk by investing in a company which is developing many different drugs/treatments (MindMed has over 10 trials going on, CMPS has only one), this way if one trial fails the company won't go bankrupt. Even if they only get one drug approved they will be doing great, we're still talking about a growing market worth Billions. Another thing is Compass¬¥attempt at [patenting](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7amw4/is-it-possible-to-create-an-ethical-psychedelics-company) shit like the color of the walls and other ridiculous stuff, I personally can't invest in them because of my moral standards.\n\n*Celebrities*\n\nEveryone investing in stocks knows that Musk's tweets are more important than fundamentals, that's why I have to mention this. Cathie Wood has heard about this, she didn‚Äôt directly say she would invest in this company but she knows about the disruptive potential of this company, and is there a more fitting stock for the ARK Innovation ETF out there? [Kevin O‚ÄòLeary](https://mobile.twitter.com/kevinolearytv/status/1385631204758728706) aka Mr. Wonderful has been supporting this company since early last year, even if you do not like him you have to admit that he has quite a lot of publicity. The company is also doing a lot of PR, with the CEO JR Rahn giving numerous interviews within the last months.\n\n*NASDAQ*\n\n$MNMD is the ticker.\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mnmd](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mnmd)\n\n*Further Information*\n\nThere are many catalysts coming up this year, the most important ones are obviously the trial results. The next major catalyst after Today should be the Special Meeting of the company on the 27th of May.

The sample size was very small and promising but many further studies need to be done. In addition, SSRIs may be the first line choice for newly diagnosed persons with depression, however there are still the choices of SNRIs like cymbalta, tricyclics like amytriptilline, SARIs like Brintellix and  & atypicals such as Wellbutrin. Microdosing of psilocybin will take place in a galaxy far, far away, and likely only ever be used for people who have failed at least 2 standard treatments. \n\nAs far as the usage of MDMA, DMT, LSD are concerned, they are being tested to be used in CONJUNCTION with psychotherapy because they open a persons mind and make it easier for them to discuss tough issues with their therapist.
