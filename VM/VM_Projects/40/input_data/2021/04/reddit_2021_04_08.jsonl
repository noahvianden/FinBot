{"title": "Help me thetagang, you're my only hope", "selftext": "Posted the following on a certain other subreddit... and it got struck once because I DARED to mention a ticker with a low market cap, then again because I posted it at 9am EST and everyone was fixated on GME at open, so it didn't get the required 6k upvotes to stay safe from their ruthless mod bots.  I also wrote this out in detail to test my own understanding, I don't think you're dummies, most of this subreddit probably knows this shit already.\n\nTL;DR - I don't want to lock up $10,000 running 3x PMCCs on something like AAPL, just to collect 3x $100 premiums over a 30-45 day expiration.  Looking at lower cost stocks with higher 30-day IV% to use for CCs, given that several of them appear to have much higher average premium returns and a lower cost of entry - owning shares instead of a deep ITM call.\n\nSo here goes.  Just a green options options trader looking for a little discussion of low cost, true covered calls.  If this strategy is shit, I wanna know.  Positions and original text of my detailed post below.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nI was setting up my first covered call of AMC and it occurred to me that searching equities based on the following two criteria could lead to some decent cost of entry as well as reasonable premium prices for selling covered calls: high implied volatility & share price much lower than AMC.\n\nThe low share price provides a low cost of entry to trading a true covered call so this strategy is entirely based on my willingness to buy 1000 shares of a particular stock to sell 10x calls against at a time to compensate for the low premiums.\n\nHere are my current plays:\n\n[2021 April 07, mid day](https://preview.redd.it/8di2e7otgyr61.jpg?width=1411&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e81c981f9abbb02e4a8de79518b81148e2d06ec)\n\nAnd here is the logic behind those plays: AMC was the first. Short term calls had a decent ask price and I already owned most of the shares I needed, so I went for it. Then got sad I could only buy 100 shares/sell 1 call at a time. So I started to look for high IV stocks below $2 per share. Found a whole bunch, but most aren't really candidates - option volume is pretty low (or non-existent) on a lot of them, meaning there might never be an opportunity to buy-to-close if you decide you want to exit the position. Settled on two different stocks after doing some (gulp) math, and split my available investment between the two, but I'm going to show my work based on a single stock, with 1000 shares as the planned buy just for simplicity. Do let me know if I fuck the math up...\n\nCan't mention the actual stocks in my example because their market caps are too low and will get auto-banned, but let's all imagine that the bid/ask for this hypothetical option of the 2021may21 C2 is currently 0.25/0.30 (at the time of my purchase, a 45 day expiration) with shares currently trading around $1.49 - so for a cost of entry @ \\~$1500 you're looking at being able to safely sell 10x calls at the $2.00 strike. Assuming the worst case bid of 0.25 as your premium credit, selling a single call (before commission and fees) gets you a premium credit of $25. (0.25 x100 = $25) So selling 10x that many calls would get you a premium credit of $250.\n\nI'm calculating returns based on a 30-day window, regardless of what the expiration might be, to keep different length options easily comparable. So $250 on a 45 day expiration (assuming full value of the premium is collected, which is not guaranteed, and holding until expiration is often not the best way to exit the position) would be ($250 / 45) x 30 = $166 per month. $166 / $1500 = 0.111, or an 11.1% return on your share purchase in a single month. Multiply that by 12 months, and I'm shooting for 133% return for the rolling year, or \\~$3500 gross return on my initial 1000 share purchase of $1500...\n\nNow before you go out and blow your whole buying power on a bunch of penny stocks with high IV that no one has ever heard of... **HOLD THE FUCK ON.** That raw estimate of 133% return is based on several underlying assumptions. Namely, that **(1)** the stock will trade sideways for the foreseeable future or go down a little, but not too much. If it goes down a lot, your 1000 shares won't be worth shit and the option premiums will tank too. So you could be stuck with a bunch of shares not worth much, that no one wants to buy options on.\n\nAlso, it assumes that **(2)** these companies don't fuck around and lose almost all their value or even get totally de-listed. Let's say that Hypothetical Inc. is a Chinese company that deals with used car e-commerce or some shit like that. Once car makers can get computer chips for their new models again and actually roll product out of the factory, used cars may not be in such high demand, and the IV of stocks like Hypothetical Inc. may tank, or their business could ground out entirely if they overextend themselves during this time of pandemic fuckery.\n\nAnd this is another big one... **(3)** that I don't mind getting assigned at or before expiration to sell all 1000 shares if the share price hits the strike. This isn't a hold-no-matter-what-buy-all-the-dips kind of strategy. And **it has to be actively managed**; you can't just hold and check your P/L every few days. Now that the warnings are done, here are the different ways that I'm expecting this strategy to play out. Let me know if I'm missing a major outcome here.\n\n**(1)** Stock trades sideways, I keep my shares and keep selling calls for similar premiums.\n\n**(2)** Stock drops by a lot. I probably just hold. No good premiums for a while. This is a risk that I **personally** can tolerate, given the low cost of entry on the 1000 shares. I won't be forced to sell them at a loss, at least not right away. **If this sounds terrible to you, don't trade this strategy!** It's also possible that options volume just dries up, meaning you won't be able to buy-to-close as I mentioned above. At least you could still hold until expiration and collect the rest of the premium, but you won't be able to safely sell your shares (if that's what you want) until the sold calls are past expiration, which could give the share price time to fall even lower.\n\n**(3)** The stock gains in value. This could be positive, or neutral. Two main possibilities:\n\n**- (3a)** The stock gains a little value, but stays below the strike. I can let my calls expire and sell a new call for the next expiration window, or roll up in strike and out to the next window before expiration, keeping premium collection pretty steady and protecting against assignment, letting me keep my shares and keep covering my calls, at the expense of getting higher premiums as the stock approaches my original strike price.\n\n**- (3b)** The stock gains past the strike, and I get assigned. Well, given that early assignment is pretty rare (or so I'm told, I could be wrong, take it up with YouTube) I should get all of the premium from my currently sold calls, and I'll also get the profit from selling my shares higher than I bought them for. So with the same 1000 shares of Hypothetical Inc., I'd get the difference between the $1.5 purchase price and the $2 sale price (0.5 x 1000 = $500), plus the $25 x 10 = $250 from the premiums of all 10 calls. Net profit of $750.\n\nNow I'd be pretty happy putting in $1500 and walking away with $2250 over the course of a 45-day option window. I'm not attached to these shares, happy to sell them for a profit and find a new donkey to ride to the next options expiration window. The main downside is that if the shares you bought really blast off, then the calls you sold will cap your profit potential to the $750 that I laid out above, but you will still make money at a decent return rate. **This is up to you to calculate for yourself**, by choosing the strike to sell your calls at based on the probability that the call will go in the money versus how much premium you collect. This is based on how close the strike is to the current share price. Smaller spread between share price & strike price = higher premiums = higher probability of your call going ITM = higher probability of assignment. Larger spread = lower \"\" = lower\"\" = etc...\n\nIf you're really bullish on a stock, and it's relatively cheap to own, maybe selling calls against it isn't the best strategy for you. It's certainly not the most theoretically profitable, but that's not really what I'm after with this strategy - I'm looking for a stable(ish) income that will let me build my portfolio without fucking around with margin or selling naked calls of SPY.

The intent of a covered call is to slightly lower the cost basis of a stock position while being fine with being called away in the stock. So the only way it really works is if you're willing to be called away. If your intent is to add income (and lower the cost basis of a tradeover time) while staying in the stock, the covered call can be a terrible choice because it forces you into situations like the one described by the OP, where you need to buy back the short call or else risk not participating in any more gains in the stock. That is compounded by the fact that it still may have extrinsic premium in it weeks before expiration, so not only are you buying it back with the stock higher, you didn't even get any decay from it. It can be a total mess.\n\nSo my point is, if your intent is to add income to a position and lower cost basis, but your intent is to stay in the stock, defined risk income generating trades like an Iron Condor make a lot more sense. You don't risk getting called away in the stock (unless you make a meal of it and allow it to expire mid-call spread) and you take advantage of selling premium in both directions, a short put spread and a short call spread, which kind of sucks if the stock went lower and you added a little insult to injury by losing money on the condor and having the stock go lower... but your positioning is bullish to begin with, so who cares? The $1 recieved in a covered call isn't going to help if the stock is $25 lower.

The deal will be ongoing for the foreseeable future.\n\nNFLX is up 60 points in a month and shy 30 points from its ATH, which I expect it to break prior to its next quarterly earnings report in July.\n\nNFLX $540c 7/16", "id": "mmzedx", "created_utc": 1617909952.0, "score": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 44, "comments": [{"body": "**I am a bot and identified and tracked the following options picks within this post:**\n\n|**Ticker**|**Strike**|**Type**|**Exp**|**Recorded Premium**|**Recorded Stock Price**|**OI**|**Volume**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**NFLX**|**$540**|**BUY CALL**|**2021-07-16**|**$46.9**|**$553.58**|**361**|**4**\n\n[Realtime ROI](https://www.pickmojo.com/pick/ckn99yoc94q9i0725afslbk4a) | [Track Record](https://www.pickmojo.com/user/onemanstrong/) | [Bot Info](https://www.reddit.com/r/pickmojo/comments/he9ghu/options_picks_tracking_bot_information/) | Leaderboard: [Week](https://www.pickmojo.com/stocks/best-this-week-reddit), [Month](https://www.pickmojo.com/stocks/best-this-month-reddit), [All](https://www.pickmojo.com/stocks/top-reddit) | [Exit this position](https://www.pickmojo.com/reddit_redirect)\n\n**^(*My owner is monitoring these posts, reply with feedback!

With Amazon getting NFL rights, Disney growing their service, Paramount entering the picture, Netflix glory days are over.  Pedophiles will still subscribe, but that's it, they are a certainly a leader for the sicko crowd.  I would buy a 2023 150p on them, look at the movies you chose to highlight, hot garbage, and movies aren't bingable, they don't keep you coming back.  Losing the office sealed the deal.\n\nWith the amount of recreational gear and toys that have been purchased during covid, I think banking on the entertainment industry in the near term is foolish.
