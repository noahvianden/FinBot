This is the 9th week in the $50-$60 range if the stock can hold $50 this week.  If UAL closes at $50 this week.  We have 16 weeks until August and this is a larger time frame to get back to test $40 then it took to go from $40-$50.  So much can go wrong for Airlines in the best of times. Now we have stagnant travel recovery and rising fuel costs.  I think going back to $40 is highly probable. Weekly MACD just did a bearish cross and earnings were dismal yesterday. Outlook was tepid as it had a lot of \"IFS\" in it.\n\nIf you can buy a $12 spread just out of the money for $300 that can print $900-$1200 based on your price targets then I say it is a good risk reward.

They also own a wine company, and have partial equity in JUUL (vaping), Anheuser-Busch (beer), and Cronos (cannabis).   They also have a majority stake in a nicotine pouch company.  It's all [here](https://www.altria.com/about-altria/who-we-are?src=topnav) if you're curious to see it.\n\nThat's why they're called Altria *Group*, it's a group of companies, which just so happen to include Phillip Morris USA, the producer of Marlboro cigarettes (in the USA).\n\nThe reason the ticker is MO is because Altria group originated from a corporation called Philip Morris Industries, which included both the domestic and international Phillip Morris business.  They decided to rebrand from Phillip Morris, in part, to get away from the stigma of Big Tobacco and also to show that they do more than just produce cigarettes.  A smart move, seeing as how smoking is declining in the US.\n\nI haven't looked at the numbers myself recently, but I would assume that the biggest source of revenue for Altria Group at present is still cigarette sales via Phillip Morris USA.\n\nPhillip Morris International spun off in 2008.  They did this to prevent regulatory pressure in the USA from spilling over into emerging markets, where regulatory pressure is quite lax.

The fact that they're a well-established company with steady cash flows makes them a better pick than a start-up cannabis company, IMO. \n\nPM is not far behind for me, smoking in the developing world shows no signs of declining and their IQOS product is doing really well.  I invested slightly less because they're already very expensive... Altria looked like more bang for your buck.\n\nI have small positions in the two of the other biggest tobacco companies, Imperial Brands and Japan Tobacco, but neither seem as innovative or reliable as PM or MO.\n\nIf you're interested in the cannabis play you could check out British American Tobacco (US ticker: BTI).  They recently put a big stake in Organigram, and they've also got global distribution including US.  It's the best worldwide tobacco play (MO and PM only catch US or international but not both), which in and of itself is awesome, and cannabis could really be a winner for them.

It may be a sell in 10 years or so, but we'll still have collected the dividends and probably make it out with a small profit.
