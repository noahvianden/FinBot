That corresponds to about **$438** as a *bearish expected move* and **$446** as a *bullish expected move*.\n\n**Implied Volatility** ‚Äì The VIX was lower on the week from around 18 to close Friday near 16. That is below its historical average and index/etf expected moves for the next week are tight as a result.\n\n**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)\n\n* SPY **0.8%**\n* QQQ **1.1%**\n* IWM **1.9%**\n* DIA **1%**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n### In the News\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) options were listed on Wednesday and the stock joined the ranks of the meme stocks, at least for a few days. The highest strike originally listed was $70, and initially, there were only monthly expiries. As we‚Äôve seen in other meme stocks, the highest call strike becomes popular in retail, and $70 was where the stock closed on Wednesday as short gamma ran out above that level. The stock finished the week at $55. Weekly options and higher strikes have now been added (as high as $170). The $70 strike, August 20th remains the strike with the most open interest as of now.\n\nSkew to the upside is sharp, with the 55 calls expiring this week around 155 IV, while the 75 calls are around 205 IV. Translation, positions that buy nearer to the money and spread by selling OTM are favorable cost/skew. The expected move for this week is about 15%:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c84e4kfhj5g71.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=76171e8657cee7cfb9a5724ec9496ffa2e323917\n\n### Expected Moves for Companies Reporting Earnings\n\nSome earnings of note this week include Palantir, AMC, Disney, and Coinbase.

Many businesses in US depend on China.

Game theory. US is not likely to fuck themselves, their economy and China is not going to fuck themselves either, exiting from such a large market. Both sides are going to suffer the loss of an unprecedented number of jobs and the effect of which is an unimaginable hit in their economies. The best outcome for both cums from co-operation.\n3. If for any reason that the size of their genitals matters more to them than their economies and people, we must remember that the rest of world gets fucked as well.
