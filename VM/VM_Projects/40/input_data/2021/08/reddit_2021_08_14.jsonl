New versions always have rewrites and improvements, that's the whole benefit of software development. 'Other automakers' don't even deliver anything, their systems are based on Mobileye or Nvidia. What they deliver is worse even than Tesla's 2-year-old public Autopilot build. \n\nWaymo has no success. They have defined a narrow problem set, use much more expensive hardware and still can't solve it economically. Waymo's valuation in the private markets has been on the decline for years. Answer my question why Google is selling Waymo (and the CEO/ other leadership leaving) if they are doing well? Waymo also have no go-to-market strategy. If Tesla solves vision-based autonomy with their current sensor suite, they will be able to roll it out to millions of vehicles overnight. The upside is much higher for Tesla than Waymo. Not to mention the higher return on investment because a Tesla is about 20% the cost of a Waymo vehicle. \n\nThe point is not where the companies are now, it is where will they be in 10 years. This is an investing subreddit, not a 'my team won this year' subreddit. Waymo is stuck in a dead-end, Tesla's system is clearly improving over time. Tesla could replicate what Waymo is doing now, the reason why they don't is that it doesn't help them solve the end problem, which is generalised autonomy.
