{"title": "GUSH TA Where we go from here?", "selftext": "We all know the price of gas is going up meaning the price of oil is going up. Maybe we can offset the high price of gas we pay at the pump with some oil tendies. I found a trend in the chart with GUSH that would put the stock at 110 a share around SEPT 15th. The chart has been in a upward trend this past year and I see it to continue. With  oil prices on the rise oil companies are seeking oil rich areas in the Eagleford shale, Permian basin and Delaware basin.\n\nAnalysts are predicting oil production to rise into 2022\n\nLooking ahead, Goldman Sachs sees Brent prices averaging above $80 in the third quarter, with potential spikes ‚Äúwell above‚Äù that level as demand comes roaring back. JPMorgan, meanwhile, expects crude oil prices to ‚Äúdecisively‚Äù break into the $80s during the final three months of the year.  Analysts at Bank of America are even more bullish. They argue Brent prices could see $100 in the summer of next year. That would mark a return to triple digits for the first time since 2014.  It comes as all three of the world‚Äôs main forecasting agencies ‚Äî OPEC, the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Energy Information Administration ‚Äî expect a demand-led recovery to pick up speed in the second half of 2021.March 2021, which is 1.4 million b/d more than February. The EIA estimates U.S. crude oil production rose to 10.9 million b/d in March and almost 11.0 million b/d in April..It's estimated that U.S. crude oil production will average 11.9 million b/d in 2022.\n\nI drew some trend lines here on my webull chart where I'm predicting the price to be around sept 15. I noticed at around feb 1 that the stonk was roughly $50 a share. It rose $40 higher to top out roughly $90 a share and then fell $30 to bottom around 60 a share. . The stock continued this pattern to top out $10 higher a share each time and, to fall and stop $10 higher than the last bottom. All dips at lows around two and a half months apart.
