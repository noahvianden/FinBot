{"title": "CC vs. CSP (Call/Put parity)", "selftext": "TLDR: People using call/put parity as a way to shut down conversations and I wanted to talk about pros and cons of both.\n\nBeen seeing a lot of people talk about how CCs and CSPs at the same strike are the same exact thing with the same exact outcome and using it as a way of dismissing conversations on how to use either in different contexts. The key for this statement is \"At the same strike\" and while it is a true statement, it is a useless statement for most investors because you are never comparing a CSP and a CC at the same strike, you are using different strikes for both in almost all cases. A better tool would be to compare a CSP and a CC at the same relative delta as at least then you are basing it off of the expected stock's price movement. So I'll first use NVDA as a way of showing why you should be comparing equivalent deltas IF you want to compare them at all. Also showing when Call/Put parity doesn't always apply\n\nI.e. NVDA on 08/08/21 using 08/13/2021 options chain.\n\nSo current price is 203.66,   \nATM CC is 203.75 bid 3.40 so max profit is 203.75-203.66+3.40 = 3.49 ; max loss is 203.66-3.40 = 200.26  \nIf you did a CSP at 203.75 you are ITM with a bid of 3.50, so max profit = 3.50 max loss is 203.75-3.50 200.25  \nCC capital used: 20,366 vs. CSP capital used: 20,375  \n\n\nSo far so good, but look at what happens with a ITM CC vs. a ATM CSP\n\n  \nATM CSP is 203.13 bid 3.20 so max profit is 3.20 ; max loss is 203.13-3.20 = 199.93  \nIf you did a buy-write with a strike of 203.13 you are ITM with a bid of 3.75, so max profit is 203.66-203.13+3.75 = 4.28 and max loss is 203.66-3.75 = 199.91  \nCC Capital used: 20,366 vs. CSP capital used: 20,313  \n\n\nYou are getting compensated for selling a CC below the current price because the stock has already gone up above that point and the market assumption is that stocks will drift upwards. So this shows that you won't always get the same profit/loss profile as each other. The bias will be based on the market's expectation of what direction the stock is moving which brings up to delta. If we compare the two strikes closest to 50 delta and 30 delta we get more realistic comparisons with more obvious pros and cons:\n\nNVDA's closest Call & Put to 50 delta is 203.75 which we modeled above at 50.4 delta and 49.6 delta respectively. So you can see there is true parity at 50 delta.\n\nNVDA's closest call and put to 30 delta is 208.75 and 199.38 respectively with 28.9 and 30.6. Bids are 1.52 and 1.76.   \nBuy-write has a max profit of 208.75-203.66+1.52 = 6.61 ; max loss of 203.66-1.52 = 202.14 ; RoR = 6.61/202.14 = 3.27%  \nCSP has a max profit of 1.76 ; Max loss of 199.38-1.76 = 197.62 ; RoR = 1.76/197.62 = 0.89%\n\nSo you can see that the buy-write has a higher return on risk (RoR) because it both has a higher max loss AND you are locked in to owning the shares as opposed to backing a CSP with cash. Cash is king, so you have to be compensated for giving up the flexibility of cash and the market does that with a higher max return on a CC. Final point is look at the difference between the strikes and the current cost. With a CC the stock has to go up 5.09 to break through your strike, a 2.5% increase. Meanwhile with a CSP the stock has to go down 4.28 a -1.9% drop. Again, the market is weighting towards covered calls because of the already mentioned reasons.\n\nSo in summary, Calls are greater overall profit, but you are losing out on the flexibility of cash and opening yourself up to greater relative risk. Meanwhile Puts are less overall profit, but you get to keep your cash in your account, can more easily use margin, and opening yourself up to less relative risk.", "id": "p0q7m0", "created_utc": 1628467920.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 49, "comments": [{"body": "> The key for this statement is \"At the same strike\" and while it is a true statement, it is a useless statement for most investors because you are never comparing a CSP and a CC at the same strike, you are using different strikes for both in almost all cases.\n\nNo. It is not a useless statement. It is simply the reality. Interest, dividends, and taxes can affect one’s decision to favor one structure over the other. Nevertheless, put-call parity still stands. Always choosing OTM strikes in CSPs and CCs, just because most “investors” do so, is ignorant at best.\n\n> So in summary, Calls ~~are greater overall profit~~, but you are losing out on the flexibility of cash ~~and opening yourself up to greater relative risk~~. Meanwhile Puts ~~are less overall profit~~, but you get to keep your cash in your account, can more easily use margin, ~~and opening yourself up to less relative risk~~.\n\nLet me edit your summary …\n\nSo in summary, CCs are “losing out on the flexibility of cash.” With CSPs, “you get to keep your cash in your account” and “can more easily use margin.”\n\nOTM CCs / ITM CSPs offer *greater* upside profit potential at the *cost* of *greater* downside risk. Meanwhile, OTM CSPs / ITM CCs offer *less* upside profit potential at the *benefit* of *less* downside risk.\n\nA few more things to consider:\n- CCs and CSPs both price-in the dividend. Early exercise risk on a CC can potentially force one to forego the dividend.\n- Writing *qualified* CCs can offer greater tax efficiency than that of CSPs.\n- A rise in interest rates will profit the CSP writer at the loss of the CC writer.\n\nEdit:\n\nI didn’t even bite into your examples, because you’re using **bids** from a frozen option chain on a *weekend*.

[The original research paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1149340) the authors wrote that inspired the book actually played a large role in how I invest today with leverage. In the book they talk about the importance of frontloading risk via leverage earlier on in your life, eschewing the typical 70-30% stocks to bonds split recommended by 'the birthday rule' that target retirement date funds typically follow for a more aggressive 200-0% stock to bonds allocation, aka leveraging yourself 2:1 and forgoing bonds altogether until a later age. By using their preferred method buying leaps to achieve a 2:1 leverage margin on your initial dollar investment earlier on in life they have shown that historically this strategy greatly outperforms a simple buy and hold approach. I lever up to 2-3 times using long dated leaps and use credit spreads and PMCCs to further augment my yield, though the authors are more conservative with a hard 2:1 leverage rule early on. The book made me think of things differently, like treating your paycheck as a guaranteed annuity/bond in and of itself, meaning your exposure to bonds is actually already overstated when you first start working because your paycheck likely represents an outsized portion of current and expected net worth. I now have about 350k in my investment accounts at age 29 (half of that came this year from cashing out on some risky plays) and don't plan on deleveraging any time soon. I'm also aggressive on the 3-5 dte short call credit spread side for SPX so that sort of negates a lot of my positive delta risk, I have -500-1000 SPY delta at any given time. For me the goal is to use leverage like leaps combined with theta yield strategies to help accumulate more shares as quickly as possible. My favorite tool here in this regard is the PMCC since I get to use less capital to sell more covered calls and plow the earnings right back into shares. Just be careful with your strikes on your leaps with markets at all time highs, be conservative when going long on a depreciating asset like leaps and be conservative on the short pmcc side as well since you may have to roll quite a few times if the market just keeps ripping like it did to me all year.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I kind of backed my way into a similar strategy.

{"title": "AVIR a potential 10 bagger", "selftext": "Alright idiots, listen up because I’m only going to say this once and hopefully you guys listen. The company I’m going to be talking about today is AVIR. \n\nWhat is AVIR? Well it’s a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing oral therapies. It IPO’d recently and has a market cap of currently as I write this 2.75 billion. I know what you’re thinking, “yeah yeah yeah another explosive biopharma that will pump and dump”. \n\nWell unlike your traditional clinical stage bio company, these guys have a ridiculous backing from some of the biggest names in the biopharma space.\n\nFidelity- just raised their stake by 60% quarterly into AVIR to about $335 million.\n\nCormorant- holds a $200 million + stake.\n\nBain Capital- $175 million\n\nRA Capital- $167 million\n\nPerceptive- $96 million\n\nNot to mention Goldman Sachs also holds about a $60 million dollar stake. Seems small but when the companies market cap is under 3 billion, all of these stakes add up. I believe institutional ownership is at around 60% which is abnormal in this space.\n\nSo what’s there to be excited about? In particular one drug. That drug is called AT-527. If you look at the chart of AVIR you’ll notice it spiked from roughly 24$ -  $94.17 in the span of a month. This is all because of this beautiful little drug. AT-527 is an oral, direct activist antiviral drug candidate which is being evaluated for COVID-19. It is currently in Phase 3 and the results from Phase 2 were astounding. It was well tolerated in 35 COVID-19 patients and in 28 HCV-infected patients. The results were so good in fact they secured a partnership with ROCHE (one of the biggest bio tech companies out there) and continue working together to bring this drug to market.\n\nNow as we’ve seen, COVID is not going away. The delta variant is spreading rapidly and now CNBC is already touting headlines that supply chain issues are starting again. The fear mongering has started and it’s only going to get worse as 40% of the population refuses to get vaccinated. The sentiment has started to change and the market is looking for a cure, I believe AVIR is well equipped to deliver. AVIR is the closest company out there to having a drug in pill form ready to distribute for the population. \n\nCASH AND RUNWAY\n\nSo AVIR is in a fantastic situation financially right now. They currently have around $800 million + in cash and are sitting at around $250 million + in debt. They came out and said this will give them enough runway to pursue all their programs through 2023. In biotech it’s common for companies to dilute their stock in order to raise cash and this OFTEN times kills momentum. One of the most frustrating things to see as an investor. AVIR also has 2 other programs moving forward (AT-752) Fighting against Dengue Fever and (AT-787) which fights against Hepatitis C. \n\nThe stock has been beaten down from its 52 week high of 94$ to roughly $18 on seemingly no news… absurd I know but the rally has started back up. The MACD has curled and we are already at 33$ give or take a few cents. I think moving forward this could easily be a 10 billion dollar company if all goes according to plan. The upwards momentum right now has no plans of slowing down. The RSI is an a pretty healthy spot on the 1 month and 6 month. I believe a short term PT of 55$ is not unreasonable and the sky is the limit for long term potential.\n\nKeep in mind that the distribution of their drug will be much easier too. They are already well equipped to deliver it around the world and it is CONSIDERABLY more feasible to distribute a pill form substance rather than one that needs to be injected. \n\nWe are expecting Phase 3 news which could be an amazing catalyst in the 2h of 2021. Not to mention we are also expecting a Phase 1 result of AT-752 for Dengue Fever in 2h of 2021 as well.\n\nThis DD isn’t the most complex but I promise you take a look for yourself and you will not be disappointed. \n\nAs always, My position is currently 1,000 shares at 27$.. skys the limit here fellas, hop in while you can 🚀 🚀 \n\nThis is not financial advice, just trying to educate some retards.", "id": "p160qj", "created_utc": 1628529815.0, "score": 57, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 43, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|3 days ago\n**Total Comments**|14|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Where was this 2 weeks ago...", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "Was waiting for a confirmation on reversal.

{"title": "$SAGE - CEO buying $1M worth of shares, I see a rebound", "selftext": "SAGE caught my eye when screening for insider buying and almost has me peeing outside the toilet when seated from just being [aroused](https://openinsider.com/SAGE):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Insider buying in 2021](https://preview.redd.it/fupiwy2m2eg71.png?width=1234&format=png&auto=webp&s=4514415012b2d26555b4e62024445c537306cbfd)\n\nThat, Ladies and Gentlemen, is 2021 insider buying that is still not really seeing profit (SAGE currently trades at $43.20 at the time of writing). The insiders have bought in ranges of $43.x-56.x for at total of **$2,615,399** this year.\n\nThe company reported results from the late stage study (whatever that means, I'm not really into pharma/biotech) that were - [according to own words](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-sages-depression-drug-study-105651812.html) \\- positive yet somehow disappointed investors who sliced the stock by \\~40% since.

Um, okay. That's rare to see these days. But what's more rare is a P/E of 3.47. Trading below 50 multiples in the year of 2021, I'm lost for words.

I have no idea if this means anything, I told you already, I'm not really into pharma/biotech stuff.\n\nSo, now you might ask, why does a person with no knowledge about pharma/biotech write about a pharma/biotech stock on a forum of degenerates?\n\n**Rebound.**\n\nI don't really care about whatever trial or phase X study they got rolling. The stock was sliced 40% in two months cause someone had their expectations hyped to the moon and got mad. I see insider buying as a strong signal of trust towards the company and their pipeline.\n\nThis play is only surrounding a rebound from that massive drop from the 14th to 15th of June and nothing more. I don't see any financial indicators as to why the stock needs to plummet nor do I see any news related that should explain it.\n\nIt's more interesting to watch paint dry than look at the options chain. Only notable strike is 40p for 20th of August with high OI compared to any other strike this year on both sides.
