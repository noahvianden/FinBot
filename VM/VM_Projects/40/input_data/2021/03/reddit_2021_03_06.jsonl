{"title": "Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning March 8th, 2021", "selftext": "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\n\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning March 8th, 2021.\n\n# **Stocks face the crosscurrents of higher interest rates and fiscal stimulus in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/stocks-face-the-crosscurrents-of-higher-interest-rates-and-fiscal-stimulus-in-the-week-ahead.html)**\n*****\n> The Covid-19 aid package is on track for final congressional approval in the week ahead — and it could be a double-edged sword for markets.\n*****\n> The legislation should be greeted by optimism around the powerful lift it could give the stock market and the economy, but it could also be met with concern about what a historically large stimulus package could do to inflation and interest rates.\n*****\n> Stocks were mixed in the past week, with the Dow and S&P 500 higher, but the Nasdaq was dragged lower by interest rate-sensitive tech names. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield has continued to press higher, revisiting its recent high of 1.61% on Friday, before trading at 1.54% in late trading. Yields move opposite price.\n*****\n> One wild card for stocks could be how interest rates behave around upcoming Treasury auctions.\n*****\n> There is a $38 billion 10-year auction on Wednesday and a $24 billion 30-year bond auction on Thursday.\n*****\n> Traders are watching these closely, after a historically weak 7-year Treasury note auction in February sent rates higher, even for the 10-year.\n*****\n> “We’re a little more cautious on them, just given what we saw in the 7-year and some Japanese selling pressure,” said Ben Jeffery, strategist on the U.S. rates strategy team at BMO Capital Markets.\n*****\n> He said Japanese institutions could be less interested in participating before the end of their fiscal year on March 31.\n*****\n> # Stimulus coming\nThe Senate was expected to approve its version of the $1.9 trillion stimulus package and send it to the House for a vote during the week. Otherwise, the market is watching key inflation reports with the consumer price index expected Wednesday and the producer price index, scheduled for Friday.\n*****\n> “I think the markets will be watching closely the progress on the stimulus package,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. “I think they’ll continue to watch the 10-year Treasury move and we’re going to get CPI data. That’s going to inform on those moves.”\n*****\n> He expects stimulus to remain a factor that could sway markets.\n*****\n> Inflation has been a worry for markets, since rising inflation could crush margins and corrode earnings power. For bond investors, it would erode value and make interest payments worth less.\n*****\n> “As long as the rise in Treasury yields matches the pick-up in inflation, I think the market will be able to handle that. I think the challenge is when yields get notably above inflation...I like to see them closely matched,” said Arone.\n*****\n> He said the market is concerned that the next stimulus package could overheat the economy and create inflation, particularly as it comes on the heels of the package approved in December.\n*****\n> “I think it lends to the conversation, ‘do you really need another $1.9 trillion?’ Arone said. “We’re going to pour more gas on the fire, and with this $1.9 trillion that’s what the market is concerned about.”\n*****\n> Consumer inflation is expected to remain somewhat muted for February, after the 1.4% rise year-over-year in core CPI in January. But the pace of inflation is likely to pick up notably in March and April, since the comparisons to last year, when the economy was shut down, will likely look extreme.\n*****\n> # Choppy to continue\n> Strategists expect the push-pull between interest rates and stocks to continue.\n*****\n> On Friday, rates were higher after a strong February jobs report and stocks were also higher. The economy added 379,000 jobs in February, about 160,000 more than expected.\n*****\n> “I don’t think 1.5%, 1.6% on the 10-year is terribly troublesome for the market,” said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. She said the speed of the move was troubling.\n*****\n> The rotation out of tech and growth into more cyclical names in the financial, energy and industrial sectors continued in the past week.\n*****\n> Energy was up more than 10% with oil prices, which were at a near two-year high. Financials saw the next strongest move, gaining 4.3% for the week.\n*****\n> “I think we’re in a choppy consolidation phase,” said Sonders.\n*****\n> “You’re seeing some extreme historical spreads between what energy and financials are doing recently versus tech and consumer discretionary,” she said.\n*****\n> Sonders added that even if the consolidation phase is close to ending, that suggests there could be more downside for some frothy names. “The good news here is I think it’s becoming a better environment for active stock pickers,” she said.\n*****\n> The Nasdaq Composite was down more than 10%, as of Thursday from its Feb. 12 high. But on Friday, the index turned around, gaining about 1.6%. That’s a positive sign for the market, particularly since it happened as rates moved higher.\n*****\n> The S&P 500 was up 0.8% for the week, and the Dow was up 1.8%. The Nasdaq, meanwhile, was down 2%.\n*****\n> “I think ultimately the higher quality segments that got hit in tech and communications probably did need to see a valuation reweighting,” Sonders said. “Arguably, we had some micro bubbles in the market, and they may need to suffer more downside.”\n*****\n> She said investors may want to adjust the allocation of their holdings regularly instead of waiting to adjustments around the calendar\n*****\n> “If you get a two three week, four five day surge in a particular sector, pare some back,” Sonders said, nothing that’s the opposite of what most people do.\n*****\n\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/To10aNZ.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE S&P SECTORS FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dWhJ1FA.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/dD0ByFt.png))**\n\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/EBYgVqH.png))**\n\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.imgur.com/6Gawyx5.png))**\n\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/dQ2GrwQ.png))**\n\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/53ABWAI.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/76tpdtn.png))**\n\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/nx5XPYB.png))**\n\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/tOFbsYf.png))**\n\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/RVs6ymH.png))**\n\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/530wcow.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/7ZHSqwf.png))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Jobs Market Gets Reopening Boost\n\n> US payrolls grew at a solid clip month over month in February, as progress in the vaccine distribution process appeared to boost growth by enabling more of the economy to reopen. Our opinion has always been that until we have achieved widespread vaccine distribution, the in-person segments of the labor market will be slow to recover losses from a year ago. We are becoming increasingly bullish on the prospect for a 2021 economic reacceleration, and we are heartened that the hardest hit segments of the jobs market may be beginning to reflect that view.\n\n> The US Bureau of Labor Statistics released its monthly employment report this morning, revealing that the domestic economy added 379,000 jobs in February, exceeding Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ forecasts for a 200,000 gain. Large seasonal adjustments to the data did serve to boost the overall number by roughly 140,000, while January’s jobs gain was revised significantly higher from 49,000 to 166,000. Colder weather than normal may have also played some role, though the worst of the freeze experienced by middle America occurred just after the report’s observation window closed. The unemployment rate fell to 6.2% from 6.3%, and was paired with an unchanged labor force participation rate of 61.4%.\n\n> “Last month on jobs day, we noted our optimism around an improving trajectory for vaccinations and the implications that may have for future jobs reports,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “This has played out so far, and we expect continued vaccination progress to become more evident in the jobs numbers as the recovery reaccelerates.”\n\n> Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% month over month and 5.3% year over year, continuing to signal that lower-wage workers have endured the worst of the pandemic’s job losses. Inflation expectations have been in particular focus for the market lately, however inflation risks from a tightening labor market are not of major concern for now in our opinion. We expect overall average hourly earnings to remain steady or even reverse as lower wage workers are rehired in service sector jobs, and we still have lots of slack in the labor market as we hover well below 2020’s peak employment.\n\n> The composition of February’s report importantly signals a reversal of COVID-19-driven trends seen in recent months. Retail trade gained 41,100 jobs while the leisure and hospitably industry gained 355,000—two segments that have been hardest hit throughout the pandemic. Meanwhile, professional and business services added 63,000 jobs and government jobs fell by 86,000.\n\n> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the jobs recovery in the leisure and hospitality sector has generally plateaued following an initial bounce. This segment of the labor market is highly dependent on in-person interaction, and has understandably suffered in a work-from-home environment. Unsurprisingly, service sector jobs have strongly correlated with broader trends in COVID-19 cases. The leisure and hospitality sector alone still accounts for about 3.5 million of the 9.5 million jobs lost compared to the February 2020 peak. And while we do caution against reading too far into one month’s numbers, we are excited to see this decimated sector tick notably higher in February.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.5.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> We have not had to look hard to find evidence that vaccines are having an impact. Nationally, seven-day averages for new cases have fallen to below early 2020 peaks, significantly below the highs of late 2020. Perhaps most crucially, the portion of the population most vulnerable to severe symptoms has largely already received at least one dose of the vaccination. A third vaccine was granted emergency use authorization in March, and this week President Biden estimated we would have enough supply of vaccinations to cover every adult by the end of May 2021. Once people can become comfortable with the virus trends, we expect widespread hiring in in-person industries to snowball quickly. February may have signaled a start to this trend.\n\n*****\n\n> # Anatomy of a Bond Market Sell-off\n\n> Coming into 2021, one of our higher-conviction ideas was that we would see rising long-term interest rates in the United States; it’s one of the reasons we recommended suitable investors consider an underweight to interest rate sensitive fixed income. However, we didn’t expect interest rates to move this high, this fast. The 10-Year Treasury yield started the year at 0.91% and ended the month of February at 1.41%, down from an intraday high of 1.61%. As such, core fixed income assets are off to one of their worst starts ever (remember that as yields go up, prices go down).\n\n> “Core fixed income assets aren’t off to a very good start this year, but we don’t think investors should abandon high-quality fixed income assets as they play an important role in a diversified portfolio” says LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.\n\n> **So what is driving interest rates higher? Changing expectations**\n\n> Inflation and growth expectations are important factors into the fundamental outlook for interest rates. Broadly speaking, what we’ve seen in the bond market this year is a re-pricing of both higher inflation and higher growth expectations. Inflation expectations have steadily moved higher, and market-based gauges of inflation expectations are the highest they’ve been since 2011. We don’t expect much higher inflation expectations from here, but we are watching how additional fiscal stimulus flows into the economy. Additionally, it seems increasing economic growth expectations have picked up recently as well. An increase in growth expectations may put pressure on the Federal Reserve (Fed) to move away from its low interest rate policy sooner than expected, which has put upward pressure on longer-dated Treasury yields.\n\n> An unfortunate byproduct of those higher expectations is that we’ve seen an increase in the volatility of the 10-Year Treasury. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, daily percentage changes for the 10-Year Treasury yield are above historical norms (each vertical line on the chart represents the one day percentage change in the 10-Year Treasury yield). As shown, over the past several months, yields have regularly moved 10-20% in either direction on any given day. We think this is due to the changing interest rate dynamic and believe that interest rate volatility will subside the further we get into this new interest rate regime.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.2.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n*****\n\n> # S&P 500 Seasonal Pattern Suggests Weakness Likely Ending Soon\n\n> In the above chart we have plotted five different S&P 500 seasonal patterns along side 2021 through today’s close. “All Years 1949-2020” and “All Years 1988-2020” represent longer-term and mid-term baseline patterns. “All Post-Election Years” includes every year that was a post-presidential-election year regardless of outcome. “1St Year Democratic President” applies to this post-election year and so does “Post-Election Year After Incumbent Party Loss.”\n\n> When comparing 2021 to these various past seasonal patterns, this year’s performance is above average, and the S&P 500 is currently experiencing some of the weakness present in the other five patterns. Historical weakness (shaded in light blue) is most visible in the three post-election year patterns in February lasting until early to mid-March depending on the post-election year pattern. All three historical post-election year patterns suggest that current weakness could be ending soon.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/312c0ff338783a2746d1f2b86e748a96/35cb088c7397be19-26/s500x750/6a02d14a98ad77a0399943ed9a4533afc4385052.jpg))**\n\n*****\n\n> # Historic Surge for the Energy Sector\n\n> The energy sector has certainly been on a wild ride over the course of the past year, perhaps the wildest of all of the S&P 500 sectors. The outbreak of the pandemic in 2020 caused such a demand shock that oil futures traded for a negative value for the first time in history, implying that someone would pay you to take delivery of their oil!\n\n> Well, that’s in the rear-view mirror for the energy market now. Year to date, the S&P 500 energy sector is up over 29% as of March 2, according to data from FactSet, more than double the return of the financial sector, the second strongest sector thus far in 2021. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 energy sector is trading at a blistering 30% above its 200-day moving average, the most ever using data back to 1990. While this might seem bearish on the surface, previous surges above 20% have historically bought above average returns over the next year rather than below average.\n\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/3.3.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\n\n> “The case can be made that energy could be a bit stretched in the near-term, but momentum often breeds more momentum,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Energy has been unloved for quite some time, but we may be in the early innings of a larger rally for the energy sector as the global economy continues to improve.”\n\n> A confluence of events may be spurring the boom in the energy sector. An expanding global economy, a historic winter storm that shut down major oil producing states like Texas and Oklahoma, and an output agreement from members of OPEC+ have sent oil prices soaring to their highest level since early 2019. It’s not just oil, either. Copper and lumber have surged past their 2019 highs as well. It’s no secret that inflation expectations have been on the rise, and the surge in commodity prices are likely adding further credence to the market’s view of higher inflation.\n\n> We have continued to warm up to the energy sector, including upgrading our view on oil in January and then our upgrade from negative to neutral in our February Global Portfolio Strategy publication.\n\n*****\n\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/tOFbsYf.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/EpicBgo.png))**\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MOST ANTICIPATED EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE MONDAY'S MARKET OPEN!](https://i.imgur.com/8Yu6xEv.png))**\n\n*****\n\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Monday 3.8.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1GusVbt.png))\n\n> # ***Monday 3.8.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES LINK!](https://i.imgur.com/8rZIyb6.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Tuesday  3.9.21 Before Market Open:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/uCPw0OM.png))\n\n> # ***Tuesday 3.9.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/Ip7ljec.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.10.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CpwVBDz.png))\n\n> # ***Wednesday 3.10.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/xvNwkyY.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.11.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/GVnk8Z8.png))\n\n> # ***Thursday 3.11.21 After Market Close:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/gZCO70k.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.12.21 Before Market Open:*** \n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/9hiUcBu.png))\n\n*****\n\n> # ***Friday 3.12.21 After Market Close:***\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n> # AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc $8.05\n**AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc (AMC)** is confirmed to report earnings at approximately 4:15 PM ET on Wednesday, March 10, 2021.

While I was driving home from work today it dawned on me that maybe GME is actually worth a lot more than what all of the naysayers would like me to believe. So maybe 3420.69 a share would be a little outlandish, and just maybe I think the yellow crayons taste like pineapple, and maybe I have toilet paper hands sometimes. But I remember back in December of 2020 believing the thesis that GME may reinvent itself and with fresh leadership grow in to a new and interesting center for gaming. I remember how frustrating it was to learn that I had lost all of my digital content when my switch crashed back in the day and had to repurchase a number of games. I remember the gut wrench when my ex took control of my decades old Xbox live account and I lost access to every digital purchase I had ever made, even after I regained access through tech support, my ex had me locked out and somehow convinced them I was the bad guy. Physical games still have a place in this world. The companies that print the graphics on the discs, make the discs, make the disc readers, graphic designers, members of the plastics industry, even the folks who make the cool little holographic stickers, collectors, and people who like stuff and things they can touch and maybe smell? all have a vested interest in the continuation of physical copies of games.

Signs tower over you in every direction begging for attention. Flashing lights, friendly sounds (like what does the intel sound make?), ear-worm jingles, catch-phrases, and slogans. This event... the MOASS GME event that started in a reddit backroom full of smooth brained apes has gained the attention of such a wide audience. All of your profit and loss porn, the memes, your catch-phrases, slogans, and emojis have influenced millions and have been cast if even for a split second (similarly to billboards on a highway,) to the masses. It isn't just about the value of the stonk any longer. It is much bigger than that. This shit has crept its way in to every form of mass media available, even the US GOV is in on the action. Gamestop could not have purchased this sort of advertising. But here it is and consciously or not the brand is being delivered and received by millions each and every day for free. People will have the words embedded so deep in to their subconscious it will take years to forget about, stop talking about, or even caring about. I think we, the fan boys and girls of this beautiful shit show are part of this drive. Part of the value now. And just maybe someone else with deeper pockets recognizes that.

Or at least don’t be long.\n\n**The Lockup**\n\nMarch 9th the lockup will expire.  Approximately 114 million shares will become tradeable.  For reference this is almost of what is outstanding (286.34 million). This is also more than double float.  Also for reference, this is 25x more than the volume average of the last 10 days.\n\nOf what I can glean this will free up 40% of shares by each underwriter  (JPM & GS), and 20% if the holder is a member of the board of management team. Softbank also owns 25% of DASH.\n\nObviously this itself isn’t a death knell.  If the company was in good shape, those holding the shares had high hopes for the company, etc, it shouldn’t necessarily prompt an absurd number of sales, thus causing significant downward pressure.\n\nAlso of note, one of the stipulations for the early lockup ending is 5/10 trading days must be at least 25% higher than the IPO price of $102 (for those following along at home that is $127.5)\n\n**State of the Business / Catalyst**\n\nDASH missed earnings Feb 26. They did this in what is possibly the best environment for their business model, when people in much of the country haven’t been able to go out to eat. They have a negative profit margin.\n\nCitron, who isn’t actually a bad guy, put a $40 Price target on DASH, and called it the most ridiculous IPO of 2020. The most compelling argument is their competitors trade at 3x to 6x earnings, whereas DASH was 19x earnings. At 6x it would be about $48/share.\n\nWith Uber’s acquisition of postmates, Uber, Grubhub, and Dash all have similar market share.\n\n\n**Edit: I had not seen /u/WBuffettJr 's posts, and wish I had, as they are more complete and robust than mine.

If I buy it today it's 10 bucks. In one month, it'll be 11 bucks. This is contango. The car is more expensive in the future because it's not in demand. Whereas if it's in backwardation, a car today will be 11 and the car in the future is 10. Demand is high so I want that car today, not next month.\n\nWhy does this drag leveraged etns down? They're composed of futures and need to roll over after each month. When rolling over, they sell that car(10) today and buy a car in the future(11) meaning they lose 1 dollar. When in contango, that means you buy high and sell low. Now apply leverage on this and your etn will go to 0.", "score": 6, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "GUSH is what my wife's boyfriend causes her to do.
