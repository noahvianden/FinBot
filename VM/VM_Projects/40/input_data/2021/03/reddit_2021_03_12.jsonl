It is also HEAVILY invested in SpaceX (and Tesla), one of the few viable space programs that will help to launch a new era in affordable space travel and industry.\n\nMicrosoft = Windows (and whatever form it evolves into) is going nowhere, it will continue to be the standard at home and in businesses and their M365 productivity platform is now exploding in uptake and features.

Simply, they can't recognize the money someone uses to buy their Robux until that person does one of two things. To recognize the money exchanged for Robux as revneue the user who bought the Robux then has to satisfy one of two conditions. They have to either buy a durable item like a piece of clothing off of the marketplace, or they have to buy AND consume something like an in-game potion. Until this is done, they can't call it revenue much like a lot of gift card type deals. \n\nThis here is so critical to understanding the finances of this company, and although I do believe the company is over valued and I personally won't be investing in ROBLOX, whenever I see people call it unprofitable and just leave it at that, I just sigh at their stupidity. I've played ROBLOX on and off ever since I was a kid in 2012. I enjoyed the trading of limited and limited u items on the game (limited supply items unlike most items sold on the catalog) and I enjoyed playing and selling them and building up an in game 'portfolio and net worth', it was just fun to do as a kid even into my late teens. At my peak on ROBLOX I got up to 10m in in game value (robux) and finally I realized how much real world currency I could get for my in game portfolio of items and robux. I began selling on a third party market place called rbx (dot) place where I sold all of my items and robux for over 20k USD before starting to buy items and robux off of other traders in the trading community and reselling them for a profit. All in by the time I stopped buying and reselling things on roblox I made an overall profit of 60k+ CAD from the ages of 16-19, which I think is pretty insane especially since a lot of this I earned while playing the game casually as a child. \n\nThe amount of user growth I have seen in ROBLOX since 2012 is insane. It is not a game, it is a gaming PLATFORM. There are millions of games you can play within their platform, some good, and some bad with a few great games in between. You can play a copied version of minecraft, a copied version of call of duty, a copied version of anything really, or you can their more popular role playing games aimed for young children. I remember back in 2012-2014 when having 5000 concurrent players in any one game was insane, now you have games like 'adopt me' that average 500,000 concurrent players at any given time. The growth has truly been insane. \n\n> Basically put, 68% of their daily active users were outside of the US and Canada regions. These include significant proven growth that's happened in France, South Korea, Germany, and other places besides. \n\nAnother interesting point has been their international growth. They've only recently gone big international. Until around 2018 they really were almost exclusively Canada and USA centric, but that's changing. They're not seeing explosive growth international as well. Quite interesting when you're playing a game on their platform and start seeing multiple languages being spoken haha, it's definitely a new thing for me to see given from 2012 to 2018 the only languages you ever saw other than English was the occasional French and Spanish from Mexican and French Canadian players.\n\n> **China** \n\nDidn't know this myself, as I don't actively play anymore, but if they can hit it off in China that will definitely be huge. \n\n> I think people reach to compare Roblox to Unity because they can't fathom understanding this company without these comparisons. Just because they sell entertainment in the form of gaming at the end, what goes into it is completely different. Its like buying your own cameras and shit compared to just using Netflix's shit to make a movie and then giving them a cut at the end of the day. \n\nAmazing point. I personally know some game developers on ROBLOX. I won't use any names or even in-game names, but I knew of a teen from England who made a game that managed tens of thousands of concurrent players and her game was pulling in tens of thousands a month in profit without her needing to spend any money on hosting services or anything. All she had to put in was her time and effort (and a decent PC to make the development process easier). It's also interesting taken into account that a lot of the game developers are young adults. \n\n> Roblox has components of a social network \n\nI am curious to see what ROBLOXs plans are in terms of becoming a social media platform as well as a gaming platform. Back when I was most active on the website they had a set of forums sort of like reddit but with preset sub forums that couldn't be edited. They had say 25 different sub forums for different topics and you could create posts and comment and discuss with other people via the forums. For me this was where I spent most of my time alongside trading virtual items in game haha. Them getting rid of these forums is actually what lost me as an active user (thank god for me haha, I spent way too much time on there). Them removing the forums was a smart business move though, as they were the most toxic space on their platform and given they cater to young children it was smart to get rid of that toxicity.\n\n> Roblox has components of a social network, a game, a marketplace, and a classroom. Its pretty astonishing, and I don't think I see Fortnite's developers making seminars to use Fortnite in the classroom. The metaverse, an idea I first heard in Snow Crash is what they're after. Imagine learning about the Coliseum in Rome by walking around it in your avatar that is the same one you used to shoot down goblins just earlier. And then using that same avatar to buy shoes in the official Jordan Roblox store, looking at a few ads on the way. Do you see where I'm going? \n\nGreat brief summary of the ROBLOX platform. I think people are underestimating the educational opportunities here. ROBLOX is actually beginning to be used in classrooms and this could lead to some interesting business opportunities in the future. \n\nThank you so much for putting out some decent DD on ROBLOX, it's been bothering me to see all of these crayon eating clowns go around talking trash about a company they genuinely don't understand. I do personally think ROBLOX is overvalued right now, by a lot, and I won't be investing at this price point myself, but I do see the potential for ROBLOX, and it will always hold a special place in my heart because I spent an unhealthy amount of my childhood on their platform.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "wow!
