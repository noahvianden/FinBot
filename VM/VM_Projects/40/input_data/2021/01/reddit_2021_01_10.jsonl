The $TSLA diamond handers and FOMO boomers have driven the price up so hard since inclusion to the $SPY that benchmark funds and even some major funds have yet to balance their ports and are still in process of doing so.\n\nIm not gonna act like Im a fkn ETF's and index savant so correct my retard interpretation if I'm wrong but from what I do know--is that $TSLA is going up so hard that its already weighted at 2% in $SPY. Thus, if these benchmark funds aren't in $TSLA or properly balanced w/ $TSLA then you're essentially short $TSLA. Thus, price will continue to rise till equilibrium is achieved in the funds--allegedly. For the 5 of you that can read, the source is a twitter thread discussing these topics.\n\nSo will $TSLA have a doomsday drop as you paper-handed bitches claim? Maybe. But that can be attributed to almost any stock that meme'd in 2020. The take-away is that $TSLA is still serving tendies, and I'm definitely still in that mufuckin' line. I couldn't give a fuck about the constant fluidity of the inner workings of corporations and ETFs and shit, so if any of you autist boomers can add any insight if you aren't sleep already at 11pm on a Saturday night, go ahead.\n\nSource:   [https://twitter.com/truth\\_tesla/status/1347307372738437128?s=20](https://twitter.com/truth_tesla/status/1347307372738437128?s=20)\n\nTldr; Lazy benchmark fund managers (aka Fund Managers that didn't have the makings of a varsity athlete on a real fund) are failing their classes and are now panicking to turn in late work before the semester ends. $TSLA TENDIES ARE STILL ON THE MENU CHOOOOOOO 🚀🚀🚀🚀\n\nEdit: First post going no good.

{"title": "$AMZN: DD on Earnings EPS and Estimates", "selftext": "Amazon is due for the breakout. It did a big try beforce christmas but came back down. They haven't released the christmas sales informations, what they usually do. My guess is they will either do it soon or keep them for earnings.\n\nChrismas must have been absolut gigantic for Papa Bezos. Last Q4 they had a 62% earnings surprise and rose 8,11% after earnings.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EPS vs Consenus Estimate vs. Stockmove**\n\n|Quarter|Consenus Estimate|EPS|Stockmove|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2020-Q4|6.96|?||\n|2020-Q3|7.41|12.37 (+66.94%)|\\-4%|\n|2020-Q2|1.74|10.3 (+491.95%)|\\+4.32%|\n|2020-Q1|6.36|5.01 (-21.23%)|\\-3.65%|\n|2019-Q4|3.98|6.47 (+62.56%)|8.11% <<<<<|\n|2019-Q3|4.46|4.23 (-5.16%)|0%|\n|2019-Q2|5.29|5.22 (-1.32%)|\\-2.89%|\n|2019-Q1|4.61|7.09 (+53.80%)|\\+2.57%|\n|2018-Q4|5.55|6.04 (+8.84%)|\\-2.65%|\n|2017-Q4|1.85|2.16 (+16.76%)|\\-1.44%|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow Corona hit us and we all know people spend a lot more time online shopping then usual!

As you can see these investements made huge gains YoY and I wouldnt be surprised if the make more than 200% YoY in Q4! Chrismas was stay at home and let it deliver. 600$ Stimulus went straight in Amazon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe EPS estimate for Q4 2020 is 6.97. If we take the 6.47 (Q4 2019 and apply the growth we guess you can see the real estimate here:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|0%|50%|100%|200%|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|6.47|9.70|12.94|19.41|\n\nSo if the only grow about 20% they will have the estimate. Would you guess they grow earnings for 20% YoY? I would make a wild guess for 150-200%\n\nIf that is true we could see an epic 10-15% move of the stock after earnings. Q4 2019 disrupted the stock and pushed it 8% higher and the surprice was only 60%. If you take the 200% Growth YoY Q4 it would surprise by 300% which could lead to absolute new ATHs.\n\nMy estimate: 150% YoY Q4, which bringt earnings to **16,175 EPS and a surprise of 232%**(!!!!)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR: BUY AMAZON!
