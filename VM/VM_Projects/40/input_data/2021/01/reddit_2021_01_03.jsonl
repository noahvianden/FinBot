{"title": "E2open: Hugely undervalued AI/Cloud SaaS used by Microsoft, Google, AMD, Boeing, etc. Merging in early Q1", "selftext": "In early Q1 P-C-P-L is merging with E2open. E2open has disruptive AI / Cloud technology for the supply-chain industry. They are widely used by big name customers including Google, Microsoft, Boeing, Walmart, Coca Cola, UPS, AMD, NVIDIA, Abbott, and dozens of others.\n\nWhat differentiates them from other (more boring) supply chain management companies is the way they use AI to predict changes in supply and demand. Basically, E2open allows companies to see 10 steps ahead into the future to forecast how much inventory they will need based on hundreds of variables (geopolitics, resource availability, etc). This saves companies hundreds of millions in waste. CEO Michael Farlekas  compares it to working at a lemonade stand and being able to know ahead of time exactly how many lemons you will need. Obviously this will save you from wasting money on lemons that would spoil. E2open is the only company that integrates this type of AI technology with a vast data Cloud network.\n\nE2open uses a subscription model to make consistent sustainable revenue from their 1000+ customers. There are multiple services they offfer, but over 50% of their customers only use 1 service. What's nice is that existing customers go on to utilize more and more of their services as they realize the value it adds to their companies. Google for example paid E2open twice as much over the course of 2 years. E2open makes additional revenue from new customers, and also by strategic value-adding acquisitions. The SPAC deal is allowing E2open to clean up their balance sheet so they can add value to their software portfolio (and charge higher premiums to existing customers) and continue making acquisitions.\n\nE2open has been growing at a rapid clip since they were taken private in 2015. In 2015 they made $80M in revenue and in 2020 they made $335M. That's 420% growth in 5 years, or roughly +84% growth per year.\n\nIn the last 5 years they increased their revenue +420% by value-adding acquisitions they've made over the last decade --- Icon (2013), Serus Corp (2014), Terra Technology (2016), Orchestro (2016), Steelwedge (2017), Zyme (2017), Entomo and Birch Worldwide (2018), Inttra (2018), and Amber Road (2018) --- and integrating these different services to create a beautiful comprehensive end-to-end platform.\n\nSomewhat surprisingly, their projections for 2021 are much lower at only +10% estimated revenue growth, which is the main reason most would argue P-C-P-L is trading so close to the NAV. However, 10% growth is actually really solid when you look at their margins and consider that 80% of their revenue is recurring with excellent customer retention. Institutional investors especially will appreciate E2open as the reliable revenue generating machine that it has  become. \n\nI'm also still optimistic about valuing E2open as a growth stock and feel the 10% is a low-ball estimate based on comparisons to the median growth of other supply chain management companies. I'm suspecting E2open will consistently  outperform expectations on a quarterly as the SPAC capital equips them to capitalize on their services, continue making acquisitions, and ultimately tap into millions in white space opportunity.\n\nEven if E2open maintained a 10% growth rate  and if this were factored into its valuation, $11/share is still too damn low. E2open compares itself to Descartes, Kinaxis, Manhattan, and Spscommerce. With a median of 10.7x revenue, E2 was only at 7x, and with a median of 34.7x, E2 was only at 21.3x, meaning E2open has a much higher upside than its peers.\n\nInstitutions will bring the stock price up to par with it's peers and I believe the low ball projected growth is a conservative number that they will completely destroy when you consider their growth of +400% over the last 5 years. While 10% is perfectly fine for a company like E2open, I'm expecting the trend of the last 5 years to continue in 2021 and we'll be seeing some exciting numbers. \n\nMy PT pre-merge is 15 and 25 EOY assuming their projected 10% revenue growth. If E2open surpasses 2021 expected revenue as I'm suspecting and they have major quarterly beats, I'm holding until 50.\n\nDisclaimer: This is my largest position.

{"title": "Your YEXT big YOLO", "selftext": "  \n\n\n**A Value-Based A.I. Investment**  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the era of growing small businesses and increasing brand presence, the internet appears to be a vast and difficult space to make a lasting impression on from a small business perspective. Small businesses may have insufficient entries in Google, Yahoo, and other search engines, where clients are likely to discover them. This is significant for these businesses, because if their information is inaccurate or missing, it will turn away potential customers. Yext, a growing New York based company under the ticker YEXT, provides a solution for modifying these entries and increasing the internet presence of small businesses.  YEXT shows promise as a growing long term stock due to its unique product line and hopeful financials.\n\nIn a sense, Yext is like Google but for enterprises that require more depth than Google can provide for them, and they actually use Google to help companies advertise and gain traction with consumer base using their APIs that are integrated with consumer platforms. The advertising industry is huge, as we‚Äôve seen Google, Facebook, and Snapchat dominate simply off reaching consumers, and collecting their data. Yext bridges the gap between businesses and unstructured data of potential consumers and existing consumers, setting them up in a multi-billion dollar industry expected to continually increase for the future. \n\nTheir main product line includes Answers: a search engine, Listings: an advertising tool to get your company‚Äôs products onto multiple platforms, Pages: a tool that helps get your business at the top of every location search, Reviews: which helps you engage with customer feedback, and Knowledge Graph/Analytics which helps business owners see their customer interactions with their webpages and other online presence. Websites used to be everything for a business but now a business requires presence across multiple platforms and integration with every search engine, map, or social media. The more a business‚Äô online presence is spread the more analytics you need too, and Yext is the amalgamation of the entire business‚Äô internet presence. This cloud-based software is easy to use, and it‚Äôs used by several reputable companies; including huge fast food chains, travel companies, car manufacturers and even banks. \n\nYext solves the problem of particular consumer questions and connects the respective business with precisely what the consumer was looking for. Specific questions such as ‚Äúwealth advisor near me who specializes in healthcare‚Äù (an example they used in their past annual report) will become increasingly easier to answer with the newest developments in Artificial Intelligence. The control of the ever-changing facts of a business are what enable it to spread its sales. Up-to-date and relevant information on every nook and cranny of the web has become a necessity, as convenience has become the most necessary commodity. Poor site experience is a huge detractor for the large majority of shoppers, and if businesses are able to retain this potential loss in customers they‚Äôd be willing to pay anything. Managing an online presence using one dashboard is going to be a very desirable service for all businesses, regardless of size. Yext links all the chains together in the cloud, for Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, and even the Chinese WeChat, all services which are improving more and more in terms of their search capabilities and they‚Äôre growing in popularity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe product or service a company provides is the most crucial aspect of a company‚Äôs success, and YEXT seems to deliver on its product. The solution requires a subscription that can be priced according to a business‚Äô specific needs. YEXT does not seem to have as many recognizable competitors. Its main competitors, Birdeye and Chatmeter, are both private companies with no real news about an IPO anytime soon, while YEXT has been public on the NYSE for three years. From this perspective, YEXT maintains an advantage over its competitors due to it being more recognizable and financially stronger due to its valuation reaching over a billion after going public. However, a reported issue with the product is that listings may go back to normal after a contract with a small business terminates. This is justifiable, because a small business could use the service for a month and reap all benefits. To improve this aspect of the solution that is controversial, maybe a potential solution could be negotiating a minimum period the contract has to be active in order for listings not to revert when it is terminated. Despite this drawback, Yext Inc. has innovated in this niche field and is emerging as a frontrunner in back-end listing modification.\n\nNow that we have established that YEXT will likely be a frontrunner in structuring advertising data, we need to establish WHY this is a growing industry, as YEXT is heavily dependent on the growth of eCommerce and other forms of online and in person business. Without businesses, Yext will have no source of revenue so the expansion of commerce is critical to Yext‚Äôs revenue. Fortunately, eCommerce and small businesses are trending upwards, indicating a healthy future for YEXT. One way to examine if this industry is growing is to analyze advertisement spending, as more online businesses directly correlates to more money spent on advertising. The graph below regarding digital advertising spending clearly illustrates that online business is growing, with advertisement spending nearly doubling over the six years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plzhvnh7w1961.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7bc511f13b8c4b13206acfc3015bfe9d5303176\n\nAnother way to gauge the health of the industry YEXT is heavily dependent on is to take a look at the growing amount of transactions online. Transactions correlate to greater revenue generated via the internet and thus a greater need for YEXT to introduce smaller businesses to this growing market. The chart below from Statista portrays the growth of Mobile POS payments and Digital commerce over seven years, almost tripling in total volume. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jydysim9w1961.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=dddd6ef6ea30f95dbe73d5f664a27193b31d6405\n\nOnce again this looks promising for YEXT, as their clients are primarily located in this sect of online business due to accurate data going hand in hand with more online sales. Furthermore, YEXT will be a solid pick for investors in the long term due to its growth along with a growing industry and its solid product. If you are interested in delving deeper into why eCommerce and online payments are growing, be sure to check out the Paypal/Square DD as well.\n\nOn their last 10k, Yext reported the following for their most recent compiled income statement:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f8renwobw1961.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=d66290b3c437c25c5798b9130d55f3fdbbd25470\n\nAs you can see for the top line, there are plenty of positive signs. Revenue has grown by over $50M yearly from 2016 to 2019, and from 2019 to 2020 revenues grew by about $70M. So the indicator when it comes to sales is overwhelmingly signaling that this company is well-positioned to grow, especially in the near future. Gross profit margins are also great as the cost of the product itself isn‚Äôt much. The potential issues in the income statement show up as you go toward the bottom line. Operating expenses far outweigh gross profits so net profits are -30% despite gross profit margins being 75%. Breaking down Opex, you can see that about ‚Öî of them go towards sales and marketing, which isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing as distributing your product can be a huge future investment, but it can be concerning for investors who want a product that ‚Äúsells itself‚Äù. Despite this rather arbitrary requirement, the sales growth justifies the spending as it‚Äôs obviously working and eventually revenue should far outpace selling expenses. \n\nIn their 10k, they state that their sales expenses primarily had to do with more wages and a higher headcount of employees. As the company‚Äôs operations grow, they‚Äôll need more employees to run it in an aggressive growth stage. Despite the constant revenue growth, the stock price has been diluted due to more underwriting in 2019. It may take a while to recover from all the extra supply that was brought into the market, but even if we see more financing in early stages, I personally wouldn‚Äôt be concerned as that‚Äôs a normal course of action for younger companies.\n\nA quick look at the financials indicates that YEXT is improving as a company over each year. Due to their relatively high amounts of investment, the EPS for the company has remained negative. The EPS was also a lot worse in previous years. However, don‚Äôt let this negative metric fool you, as the EPS has been trending positive since the first quarter of 2020. This indicates significant improvement, especially since the EPS hasn‚Äôt been improving much prior to 2020. The increase of the EPS is also supported by the increase of change in working capital from $2M to $4M. As for the rest of the cash flow statement, the negative values are primarily caused by the expansion of operations. This expansion of operations is indicated by the increasing total assets, which means that YEXT grew their assets via larger operations. Although the numbers may be negative temporarily, the expansion of operations allows YEXT to generate more revenue from operations and hopefully turn the direction of cash flows around. Constant reinvestment back into the company is a good sign as it indicates owner and shareholder confidence in the future prospect.\n\nFinally, delving into the 10Q provides reassuring prospects for the future health and growth of YEXT as a company. Looking at the breakdown of individual risks, YEXT looks to be relatively secure in the future. The main risks of the company are internal, and are not influenced by factors such as inflation and foreign currency fluctuations. To some, YEXT may appear risky due to its limited financial history and potential unprofitability due to it being relatively new. However, these risks will ultimately be insignificant, as the expansion of operations will soon be recovered by profits if YEXT maintains its current scale of growth that it has achieved in 2020.\n\nIn conclusion, YEXT will be a good pickup for many investors because the enterprise solutions industry overall has done very well, and Yext‚Äôs solutions are definitely a foray into the future of artificial intelligence combined with traditional SaaS. If you compare Yext to another company that has a similar premise, Twilio, you can see that Yext‚Äôs price/sales ratio is only 1/7th of Twilio‚Äôs. Of course, Twilio is far more overvalued and has had better sales growth than Yext this past year, but Yext isn‚Äôt a slouch in sales growth either as we‚Äôve seen. Plus, they have far more potential than Twilio does as we‚Äôve seen with their relatively small market cap of $2B. Both companies offer AI-based enterprise solutions, but Yext is just as good if not a better solution for the future as it has more applicability through a variety of businesses. If you want to see similar growth to what we‚Äôve seen in company‚Äôs such as Twilio but feel as if you‚Äôve missed the bus, don‚Äôt worry: we‚Äôve got the pick for you. Yext is still 25% off its 52-wk high, and they are sure to surpass it with just one or two blowout positive ERs which will be in the books soon.", "id": "kpeb5t", "created_utc": 1609650670.0, "score": 30, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 40, "comments": [{"body": "Tl:dr?
