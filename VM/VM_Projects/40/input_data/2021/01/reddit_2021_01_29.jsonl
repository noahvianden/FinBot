{"title": "Why BDRBF could be ready to explode (DD on Bombardier)", "selftext": " This is going to be a bit long but I don’t think you want your DD’s to be short. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nJust a little background. BDRBF, or Bombardier, is one of 4 major airlines manufacturers in the world. Boeing and Airbus make the big planes, Bombardier and Embraer make the smaller planes (think private planes). Okay so a lot of people have been looking at COVID recovery stokes and as a result hotel stocks like MGM are already trading at 90% of their precovid levels (having recovered from a \\~75% fall) and I won’t even get started on things like AMC. Most of the potential COVID recoviery plays are priced as if covid is almost gone, when the reality is things won’t return to ‘normal’ for at least 6 months. But then we have BDRBF, it’s still sitting at less than half of it’s pre covid numbers, and here are 9 reasons it’s massively underpriced and the stock price is likely going to the stratosphere alongside the planes they make.\n\n1. First and probably most important, it’s undervalued compared to its competitors. Boeing and Airbus both have EPS (earnings per share) of -8, and Embraer an EPS of -22. Obviously these numbers aren’t good but what can you expect from a plane manufacturer during a global pandemic/ Meanwhile Bombardier’s EPS is only -1, much cheaper than its competitors. EPS obviously isn’t the perfect number for comparisons with different share prices and different number of shares but the 3 competitors have all had 4 quarters in a row of negative earnings, BDRBF is the only to have one positive earning quarter, and it is the most recent quarter (signaling their return to profitability). And if you look up the earnings misses/beats and earnings/revenue for the 4 companies BDRBF is the strongest. Part of this is because the private jet sector has been less impacted than the public aviation sector as discussed below.\n2. BDRBF has around 8-9 billions dollars in debt. Yea i know this is bad, but let me tell you why it’s actually not. The large amount of debt they have compared to their 1.5 bill market cap might seem bad, and it’s a big reason the stock has stayed depressed for years, but after this week their debt will be cut in half as they sell off their train division for \\~4.5 billion, cutting their debt in half. On top of this they have $12 billion dollars of back orders. That means with the new capita they have coming in from the sale they can significantly reduce debt and have cash to expand their production capabilities to meet their backorder demand (which they are doing).\n3. BDRBF is Canada’s version of too big too fail. Although they are not at risk of bankruptcy, if they ever get in trouble Canada will likely bail them out (as they have done in the past). BDRBF is a very large company in Canada and has international footing.\n4. Short volume is at 39%. While this isn’t too important, it’s a possible benefit with all of the short busting that’s been going on, and a potential for an immediate boost as hedge funds have been trimming their shorts across the market.\n5. They’ve been cutting their less profitable divisions for years and after the sale of their train division, will be left with their high end jet travel division. These are the $70-100 million dollar private jets that have good margin and are (and have been) less susceptible to market turndowns. For example, covid decreased high end private jet orders only half as much as they decreased plane orders overal. The rich really aren’t affected by this stock as much as normal aviation travel has been.\n6. BDRBF has entered into partnerships with companies like MHI which have transferred the risk of maintenance of aircraft to them, while still allowing BDRBF to supply the parts for those repairs. This derisks the company so you won’t have to worry about 1 plane crash tanking the stock like what sometimes happens with airline stocks.\n7. Revenue from the business aircraft activities (the division they are focusing on as they’ve sold off their other divisions) actually grew 10% last year.\n8. The volume of shares traded is at an all time high. This is something we see a lot with turn around stocks as people flood to but the stock before a sudden and sharp rise in price.\n9. After a rush to buy pre owned jets in Q4 of 2020, pre-owned jet inventory has dropped to just 8% this month, the lowest number in more than 2 decades. An unavailability of pre-owned jets does (and has in the past) pushed/forced people to buy new jets, which will lead to more business for BDRBF.\n\nTLDR: Don’t let the low share price or recent struggles fool you, Bombardier is set for an amazing bounce back as they raise billions in capital to increase production capabilities to fulfill their BILLIONS in back orders\n\nPosition: 350k shares purchased today", "id": "l7wjuy", "created_utc": 1611936985.0, "score": 109, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 53, "comments": [{"body": "I'm actually wondering if this is a meme/joke or not.\n\nAs someone from the province where Bombardier is from, I would NOT invest in them.

{"title": "1/29 Friday Stock Market Movers & News", "selftext": "#Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Friday. Here are your pre-market movers & news this AM-\n\n*****\n\n#[4 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-29-2021.html)\n\n*****\n\n> # 1. Dow futures extend losses as Wall Street’s volatile week continues\n\n> The Dow Jones Industrial Average was set to drop 300 points at Friday’s open, extending losses with Dow stock Johnson & Johnson falling after the U.S. drug giant released data about its one-dose coronavirus vaccine. The shot was 72% effective in the U.S., but less so in other regions. Wall Street has seen a volatile week, also marked by the Reddit-fueled frenzy around GameStop and other highly shorted stocks.\n\n> The Dow Thursday recovered nearly half of Wednesday’s 633-point decline, the worst one-session drop since late October. Ahead of Friday’s trading, the Dow was nearly 2% away from its closing record high earlier this month. Three Dow stocks — Caterpillar, Honeywell and Chevron — reported quarterly earnings before-the-bell, along with drugmaker Eli Lilly.\n\n*****\n\n> # 2. J&J says vaccine less effective against some Covid variants\n\n> J&J’s highly anticipated vaccine results were based on 468 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the phase three trial’s more than 43,000 volunteers, including those infected with the new, highly contagious strain found in South Africa. J&J also said the vaccine was 85% effective in preventing severe disease four weeks after vaccination in all adults. If the J&J vaccine gets cleared by the FDA, it would be the third approved for emergency use in the U.S., behind the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine and Moderna’s, both of which are two doses.\n\n> U.S.-based biotech firm Novavax said late Thursday that its coronavirus vaccine was more than 89% effective in protecting against Covid-19. In its phase three clinical trial conducted in Britain, the two-shot vaccine appeared to be 85.6% effective against the new strain originally found in the U.K. However, a phase two study in South African, the Novavax was only 49.4% effective against the new variant found in that country. Shares of Novavax surged nearly 60% in Friday’s premarket.\n\n*****\n\n> # 3. Robinhood raises $1 billion, taps credit lines to facilitate GameStop trading\n\n> Robinhood raised $1 billion overnight from investors to shore up its balance sheet as the brokerage app was set to ease restrictions in the trading of certain volatile stocks, according to CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin. The money raised was on top of the $500 million the broker accessed through credit lines to ensure it had the capital required to keep allowing its clients to trade stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev told CNBC tapping the credit lines was a proactive measure and denied it was because of a liquidity issue. After stumbling a day earlier, GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares surged 80% and 50% in Friday’s premarket, respectively.\n\n*****\n\n> # 4. Democrats reject GOP attempts to break up Biden relief measure\n\n> Democrats on Capitol Hill and the White House rejected a Republican pitch to split President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan into smaller chunks. Democrats appeared ready to push the measure through without GOP help. Success would give Biden a signature accomplishment in his first 100 days in office, unleashing money to expand vaccinations and reopen schools, send $1,400 direct payments to households, and other priorities, including a gradual increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. Failure would be a high-profile setback early in his presidency.\n\n*****\n\n#STOCK FUTURES CURRENTLY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR STOCK FUTURES CHARTS!](https://finviz.com/futures.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://i.imgur.com/FAARPIg.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S MARKET MAP:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S MARKET MAP!](https://finviz.com/map.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/3sV2GGG.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S S&P SECTORS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S S&P SECTORS CHART!](https://finviz.com/groups.ashx)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/tHi3iJP.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S ECONOMIC CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/b6nExyq.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S UPCOMING IPO'S!](https://i.imgur.com/Hfq6e7l.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!]()**)\n(N/A.)\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS CALENDAR!](https://i.imgur.com/rSAUfwb.jpg)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES BEFORE THE OPEN TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS MORNING'S EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.imgur.com/UO3iJXe.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#EARNINGS RELEASES AFTER THE CLOSE TODAY:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON'S EARNINGS RELEASES!]()**)\n(NONE.)\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/tyEgAPB.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/B8MdQcL.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S ANALYST UPGRADES/DOWNGRADES LINK #3!](https://i.imgur.com/4GYL3Jo.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR YESTERDAY'S INSIDER TRADING FILINGS!](https://i.imgur.com/vSBQ9GL.png)**)\n\n*****\n\n#TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR:\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #1!](https://i.imgur.com/PyefIYU.png)**)\n######(**[CLICK HERE FOR TODAY'S DIVIDEND CALENDAR LINK #2!](https://i.imgur.com/v5mmpPt.png)**)\n\n\n*****\n\n#THIS MORNING'S STOCK NEWS MOVERS:\n\n######(**source: [cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-biogen-skyworks-solutions-novavax-more.html)**)\n\n*****\n\n> **Biogen (BIIB)** – The drugmaker’s shares jumped nearly 12% premarket on news that the Food and Drug Administration has extended the review period by three months for its experimental Alzheimer’s treatment aducanumab.

We learned that Robin Hood's boss is Citadel. Yes the same Citadel that bailed out Melvin Capital. The most likely reason Robin Hood bailed them out is because if Citadel goes under Robin Hood will probably go under. \n\n\n(Yes you read that correctly) You hear that at the   mark\n\n\n2.We learned that Citadel's boss Steven Cowon use to own a hedge firm that got (word for put out of business).... (Destroyed maybe? ) for insider trading. 16.08 in mark—— Steve Cohen Company S-A-C \n\nNow this mother fucker is in charge of the company that is in charge of Robin Hood where we put our money. This makes a shit ton of sense. \n\n\nSee this at the 13.20 min mark.\n\n\n\nWhy does Robin Hood need Citadel you may ask? Robin Hood is a (free-ish app) that doesn't charge you for commissions. How do they do that?\n\n\nThey do that by sending your order out to be filled by a brokerage slash hedge fund like Melvin Capital or Citadel. That company then makes it's own stock moves to play off your stock moves to make better decisions. Decisions that will make their company the most amount of money. Hear that at this mark. ——(22.27 minute mark)—— \n\nRobin Hood actually paid out 34 million dollars in Dec 2020 for not giving their members the best deals on there trades being made (by these crooks like Melvin Capital and Citadel, and Steve Cowan NY mets owner) ——  (7.19 minute mark) ——payment for order Flow (best execution) (with rebates)\n\n\n(Watch at this Mark) ———14.05 minute  mark——— \n\nThe fucked up thing is they paid up but didn’t confirm or deny these allegations.
