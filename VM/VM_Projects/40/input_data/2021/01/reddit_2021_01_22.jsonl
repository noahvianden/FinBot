They do use casted parts, but they are smaller components.\n\nAnother reason no one else does it, casting like this requires an ENORMOUS capital expenditure because each vehicle requires its own cast design and machine to produce it. Legacy automakers typically do not have the free cash flows for the R&D, design, iteration, and testing of a novel and unprecedented new manufacturing process like this. Because if the new idea fails, the C-Suite is all fired and the company struggles hard.\n\nBut the upside of this manufacturing style is that the vehicles they do make are enormously simplified and profitable.

{"title": "🐻 take on $BB from an automotive employee nobody", "selftext": "#I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING PROCEED WITH CAUTION \n\nAccording to this sub there are three things going for $BB that cause it to be undervalued:\n\n- Cylance Acquisition \n\n- Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS\n\n- QNX \n\n## Cylance: I'll start with the one I don't know shit about \n\nThis is a crowded space (anti virus). That's all I have to say about that.\n\n## Blackberry IVY partnership with AWS:\n\nAWS is fighting hard to get market share in the edge computing space. Perfect example of this is AWS Greengrass and IoT core.\n\nWhat is [AWS Greengrass](https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass/)? It's IoT device management. AWS is going to do the device lifecycle management for QNX deployments on vehicles. (speculation) Essentially, this looks to be AWS Greengrass integrated with BB QNX.  \n\nWhy does AWS want to partner with BB QNX? Well to me, this looks to be a classic extend embrace extinguish play by Amazon. AWS has products such as IoT core that can manage telematics flow between OEMs and vehicles, what they don't have is products for in vehicle development. Once they understand the market, they will introduce AWS products along side IoT core to replace QNX piece by piece in the vehicles. \n\n## QNX\n\nOk WSB. Y'all keep saying that QNX will take $BB to the moon because all these upstart EV nobodies are using QNX to bootstrap their infotainment systems. \n\nEnter automotive linux: https://www.automotivelinux.org/\n\nAutomotive linux is a partnership with a TON of traditional OEMS to build an open source software (linux) stack for vehicles such as infotainment, edge compute and telematics. \n\nThis is effectively the nail in the coffin (IMO) for QNX. If these EV upstarts gain marketshare, they have no reason to continue paying $BB for a closed source, price-y QNX. They'll migrate to automotive linux for F R E E. No more niche QNX developers, get a generic dev with some linux info and they'll be up to speed in no time. \n\nIf QNX dies, so does the IVY partnership. In fact, since AGL linux based and open source, no doubt Amazon will make amazing AWS client libraries to integrate with Greengrass, IoT Core, etc. Once Amazon gets its fingers into AGL, IVY is dead in the water.\n\n\nSo where does this leave us? Cylance. In my know nothing option $BB's only asset is Cylance in a highly competitive space. Once virus protection entities get big enough, hackers start developing FUD (fully undetectable) solutions to the most popular virus protection software. Back in their day you think McAfee or Norton was shit? No. They became popular and had hackers develop against their software.\n\n----\n\nGL WSB on $BB. I hope you succeed. I have no position on $BB.

The issue with SOUP is that since the software is developed from a plethora of sources, the origin and quality of the software code is unknown and, therefore, cannot be relied upon to perform safety-related functions. Due to its very nature, Linux doesn’t provide records of the development processes, and there are no requirements, traceability matrices or development plans to back up the design of the software. This means that the onus is on you to provide proof that the software does what it’s supposed to do.

This architectuture provides an extensive level of fault containment and recovery. The microkernel architecture means that every driver, protocol stack, filesystem and application runs outside the kernel, in the safety of memory-protected user space.
