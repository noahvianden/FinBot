{"title": "A Note To New Investors - A Series of Tutorials", "selftext": "It has become exceeding clear that a lot of new investors, and even some seasoned ones have overlooked some crucial aspects regarding finance as a whole. I am beginning a tutorial series on YT and here, starting with finance and working our way up to investing/trading tools and strategies. Welcome to the first one.\n\nA large portion of individuals understand what money is but few know what we are supposed to be doing with it. Today we are going to discuss the 4 buckets of finance.\n\n**Short, Mid, Long, Retirement**\n\nThe purpose, asset classes, advantages and disadvantages of each will be discussed.\n\n**Short-Term Bucket**\n\n*Purpose:* It is meant to be 3-6 months worth of expenses that you have saved away. It should never exceed more than 6 months as your money in a savings account is actually losing value over time. It is meant to fund short term things such as your car breaking down, we can call this the emergency fund.  It is also a safety net, for instance, if you were to lose your job then you are sure you have 6 months to find a new one. This is perhaps the most important bucket to investors and I will explain why later.\n\n*Asset Classes:* Cash, Checking, Savings, Money Market Accounts\n\n*Advantages:* It is liquid meaning you can withdraw at any time, and it is safe as the money is insured and secured. More than that, it keeps peace of mind. This is why it is so important to investors; one of the largest risks while investing is emotion, with a full short term bucket you will not fall prey to emotion as much as you would if this was all of your funds.\n\n*Disadvantages:* Low returns, typically less than 2%. Now, keep in mind, inflation averages 2-3% and therefore outpaces your returns de-valuing your money over time. This money is also fully taxable. These are reasons why it should never exceed the 6 months worth of expenses mark. All additional funds beyond your emergency fund should be moved to other buckets to grow exponentially, outpace inflation, and increase your net-worth.\n\n**Mid-Term Bucket**\n\n*Purpose:* It is meant to fund mid-term goals such as purchasing a home, paying for college, investing in a company. This is where most people on Reddit are currently operating and where too many are being their financial journey.\n\n*Asset Classes:* Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETF's\n\n*Advantages:* Contrary to popular belief 7-8% is the target goal for growth. If you are able to pull off 20% or higher annual returns, then good on you. If you have a separate fund that's available for high-risk investments akin to gambling, this is how you could see 1000%+ returns. Another advantage is that its relatively liquid, meaning you could sell off securities to retrieve your money at anytime. However, it is *relatively* liquid because if they market is moving against you then you would have to sell at a loss, or even if the market is in a bull run you wouldn't want to pull out until you're closer to the top.\n\n*Disadvantages:* First and foremost; risk. Not only are you subject to market risk, but that market risk is controlled by global socioeconomic factors that could be impossible to predict. The way people react to these things is based on emotion. So emotional risk isn't only your own, personal emotion, but the emotion of everyone else in the market. Your personal emotion could be curbed by having a full short term bucket. Gains are taxable...by quite a bit. [Here is a calculator](https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator) so you can see for yourself. Finally, there are some serious barriers to entry regarding FUD (Fear. Uncertainty. Doubt) and knowledge. I am hoping that this tutorial series could help alleviate some of that concern.\n\n**Long-Term Bucket**\n\n*Purpose:* This is meant to diversify and hedge against market risk. This bucket requires some serious capital and should be started after seeing some success in your mid-term bucket. Albeit, some individuals will purchase homes prior to investing but I don't think jumping right into real-estate is always the wisest financial decision.\n\n*Asset Classes:* Real estate, small business, cash value life insurance, fixed annuities\n\n*Advantages:* Relatively safe, several tax benefits, and it creates generational wealth; meaning these are things that could stay within your family line. The returns are typically 4-5% in this bucket. They aren't meant to outpace inflation by a terrible sum, but enough to diversify your wealth and secure tangible assets.\n\n*Disadvantages:* This bucket is probably out of many's reach right now due to the capital requirements. Even still, it is not a bucket I am focused on due to this significant disadvantage: your capital is tied up in the short term. I am personally not at a place where I want my capital tied up, all of it is in the midterm bucket until I have reached my financial goals and am ready to move on.\n\n**Retirement Bucket**\n\n*Purpose:* Well...to retire. I'm sure many of you are familiar with this bucket but a lot of younger folks (myself included) seem to have forgotten that we will one day need to rely on funds in order to survive. We don't put enough emphasis on this bucket earlier on in life.\n\n*Asset Classes:* Roth 401k, 401k, Roth IRA, IRA, Variable Annuity\n\n*Advantages:* A large advantage to this bucket is the tax advantage. Depending on which direction you go, you could end up with tax-deferred or even tax-free growth. Because the market generally trends upward, this also means on a long enough horizon you will see larger returns. The biggest benefit and the prime reason I utilize this bucket is the 401k company match. To turn that down is equivalent to denying free money.\n\n*Disadvantages:* You cannot forget that this is still the market, so you are still held to similar disadvantages as the mid-term bucket. The market could move against you and market or independent emotion could play a factor as well. Another disadvantage is that it is virtually illiquid, while you are able to take your money out you will be hit with a pretty severe penalty. This in conjunction with personal emotion could add up to serious financial disaster. The final disadvantage is that annual contributions are capped. IRA's are capped at $6000 and 401k's are capped at $19,500. Even if you have the wealth to fully commit to both of these for 60 straight years that would equate to roughly $1.5M (of course not including the returns)\n\n**Summary:**\n\nI truthfully don't believe anyone should even consider investing until they have their short term bucket full. It will make you a better investor by helping mitigate emotional response and will also provide peace of mind to allow you to practice patience in the market. On the other side, for those who have filled their short-term bucket and continue adding to their savings account, you are quite literally throwing money away and should consider at least one, if not all, of these follow-on buckets.\n\nThe tutorial series will be focused heavily on the mid-term bucket, primarily regarding stocks. This bucket is single handedly the largest creator of wealth in the entire world.\n\nThe long term bucket is a fantastic way to give peace of mind, diversify your wealth, and create generational wealth for your family and legacy. However, the capital requirements and short term lockup makes this something we won't focus on in the series until a much later date. I hope that myself and you will be considering adding to this bucket at the same time and we could open a new series on this bucket specifically.\n\nThe retirement bucket isn't something that should be ignored but should be getting added to gradually over a long timeline. Truthfully, I expect to retire from the mid-term bucket, however, I am adding to this bucket solely due to the 401k match by my employers.\n\n**TL;DR:** Before you begin investing, or even if you have and don't really know what you should do with this money, you should consider learning a bit about finance first. As we continue to crowd source and share information, I hope this generation to exhibit enough knowledge, perseverance, and grit to create a real shift in wealth distribution. Follow me for the tutorials to come. I look forward to your thoughts and questions.\n\n*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor, I am passionate about finance and have utilized certain tools and ideologies to take control of my money and work towards true financial freedom. None of what I say is direct advice and should not be interpreted as such. These are simply things that have worked for me and I want to share them with you.* ", "id": "lqzrk7", "created_utc": 1614130896.0, "score": 519, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 48, "comments": [{"body": "Thank you for giving out  advice for the new investors like myself.

{"title": "$SCR - Everything you need to know about this company before their IPO to the NASDAQ", "selftext": "I'll start by providing a chronological history of the company, then I'll explain the three pillars of Score Media and Gaming which drive the company today and some further context.\n\nTheir History:\n\n* 1993 - They launched SportScope, a Canadian TV channel with a sports ticker/scroll banner at the bottom.\n* 1997 - SportScope morphs into Headline Sports.\n* 2000 - Headline Sports morphs into \"the Score Television Network\".\n* 2007 - theScore is the first multisport news and data app launched on Apple App Store.\n* 2011 - theScore established itself as market leader in the mobile sports coverage space with 1 million active users.\n* 2012 - theScore Inc is created after theScore sells its TV company \"theScore Television Network\" to  Rogers Communications.\n* 2015 - theScore creates its eSports platform on YouTube.\n* 2019 - They partner with Bet.Works to create betting backend technology. They launch sports betting in New Jersey in partnership with Monmouth Racetrack, becoming the first and only US media company to create and operate a mobile sportsbook. They also enter into a strategic multi-State market access partnership with Penn National Gaming\n* 2020 - They launch sports betting in Colorado and Indiana and up list from TSXV to TSX.\n* 2021 - They've launched in Iowa and have announced their IPO for the NASDAQ. They stated that there will be more state expansions to come this year for theScore Bet.\n\n**The three pillars**\n\n*theScore*\n\n* theScore app is one of the most popular mobile sports apps in North America, ranking 3rd in North America and in Canada among multi-sport news and data applications. In Canada, theScore app had approximately double the users of its closest competitors, TSN and Sportsnet, and approximately ten times the users of ESPN‚Äôs app.\n* theScore app generated approximately 3.7 billion user sessions over the last year, with average monthly sessions per active user growing at approximately 9% from 2016 to present.\n* Users of theScore app engaged with the application for approximately 101 minutes per month on average, ranking first among their peers\n* Their user chat features are very popular, particularly among users focused on sports betting, with approximately 48% of users who chat sending betting-related messages, and approximately 40% of their overall monthly active users consuming public chat content.\n* They recently announced their all time record in revenue generated from ads in their app.\n\n*theScore esports*\n\n* theScore esports produces and shares original videocontent pieces across its web and social platforms, including features and documentaries on high-profile teams, games and players from across the world of esports, as well as highlights and interviews. theScore esports‚Äô video content is distributed across YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok.\n* They have approximately 1.6 million subscribers to their YouTube channel.\n* 1.1 million followers on TikTok as of Dec 2020\n* Their esports video content generated approximately 357 million views across all channels during the three-month period which ended November 30, 2020. Representing a 358% year-over-year growth in total views of their esports video content from the same period last year.\n* Worldwide, it's estimated that 495 million people watched esports online or on television in 2020, and that viewership could grow up to 646 million people annually by 2023. As a result of growth of interest in younger generations of sports fans, it is estimated that esports will become one of the biggest categories of sports betting over the long-term.\n\n*theScore Bet*\n\n* theScore Bet is authorized to provide sports betting services in New Jersey, Colorado, Indiana, and in Iowa. They also have market access for up to nine additional states via their multi-state market access agreements with Penn National Gaming\n* theScore Bet has market access to operate an online casino in New Jersey via a multi-year agreement with Twin River Worldwide Holdings, Inc. and anticipates launching its product in the state in the second half of calendar 2021. This is important because\n* Approximately 50% of users of theScore Bet on iOS devices are also users of theScore app, engaging with their content and their integrated media and betting ecosystem. This means that because they already have the userbase through their media that they don't have to spend as much on marketing compared to their competitors.\n* The total online gross gaming revenue generated in the United States is estimated to reach approximately $18 billion, of which approximately $6.4 billion is estimated to be generated in the states covered by their market access agreements.\n\n**Further Context:**\n\nCanada is on the brink of legalizing single event sports betting through bill C-218. It passed the 2nd reading by a vote of 303 and 15. It's estimated that wagering will begin by September (Start of the NFL). This is important for thescore because of their strong Canadian user base.\n\nOn February 11 2021 theScore completed a 10-1 share consolidation for the purpose of up-listing to the NASDAQ. They announced their IPO this week ~~and several sources indicate that their pricing will take place tomorrow. Usually the stock starts trading 1 day after the pricing, therefore it will start trading on the NASDAQ on Friday. I expect to receive an official statement from theScore tomorrow.~~ The stock will trade under SCR on the TSX and the NAS.\n\nThe two key factors to their success as a betting company will rely strongly on the integrations between their media and betting platforms which no other company can compete with and their massive user base from their sports media app converting to bettors. As I stated above, almost 50% of the users who chat via their media app also bet.\n\nSCR'S market cap currently sits at 1.64B, in comparison DKNG sits at 23.61B and PENN sits at 18.69.\n\nThis shows the kind of opportunity that theScore has and the unique position that it is placed in.\n\nEDIT: theScore [announced](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thescore-announces-pricing-upsized-initial-010000199.html) that they will be trading on the NASDAQ as of FEBRUARY 25.

(see interview: https://www.jesuscalling.com/podcast/surviving-and-thriving-to-help-gods-children-victoria-damone-catherine-wood/)\n\nEgregious examples of irrationality (historical and present) can give Christians a bad name sometimes, but there are plenty of fastidiously scientific critical thinking Christians too.\n\nHypothetical example of a fastidious manager/executive: \n\nSubstitute any % you want| Decision Support A| Decision Support B| B also determines how A is cherry picked & interpreted |\n---|---|----|----|----\nnonsecular| 50% \"Data\" | 50% \"Gut\" | B consists of arbitrary # of rationalizations |\nsecular| 50% \"Data\" | 50% Gut + \"Faith\" | B consists of arbitrary # of rationalizations and percentage attributions |\n\nWhat others may attribute to \"hard-work\", \"trust in business partners\", \"luck\", \"tolerance of uncertainty\", the religious person may simply attribute under umbrella of \"faith in God.\"  That can be dis-satisfying at first for those that expect a readily digested naturalistic concise and consistent psychological/logical response.  The answer is going to be unique to both the worldy and spiritual experiences of whomever is making that decision and will make sense depending on how well one can momentarily synchronize with said religious person's mindset (regardless of how religious you are or aren't.)\n\nAnd sometimes experiences of synchronicity (i.e., special meaning read from individually unusual events) combined with reassurance of faith are the trigger for what finally motivates religious individuals to enact major changes to effectively escape local maxima (in business, relationships, or other life situation.)\n\nMy points are mainly: (1) don't be too quick to be wary/discount thinking of religious folks (but doesn't hurt to verify if you're concerned) and (2) that there's an existing non-\"data\" portion in secular decision making that isn't necessarily always larger for religious folks.

{"title": "Why \"inflation hawk\" expectations are out to lunch", "selftext": "I've been heavily sighing at a lot of posts and news articles lately. Particularly at people crowing about Burry and inflation. Here's a quick explanation of why they are wrong, and why Powell is right, despite other central bankers worrying right now. \n\nInflation is one of the most misunderstood things in economics. Also, Burry is out to lunch on this one. Inflation is not a problem, and won't be for at least the rest of this year, likely longer. \n\nFor starters, asset prices and bond yields are only tangentially connected to inflation. Yields most directly, because they tend to reflect expectations - which, in the current environment, with yields rising from essentially zero, just means \"not deflation\" as opposed to \"runaway inflation.\" Powell's comments yesterday were 100% correct on that account - the only reason other central banks are a little concerned is that a rebound in US yields will drive up EM borrowing costs, and a rebound in the global economy will drive up capital flows to non-US markets, leading to inflation \\*elsewhere\\* (we are a flight to safe haven, relatively speaking).\n\nEven further - US asset prices have relatively little to do with inflation these days, largely because of the relatively open international economy. Stock prices *right now*, in particular, are purely due to there being relatively few places to park money despite a broadly *deflationary* global economy over the past 12-18 months. The retail trading spike is part of it, too, as is international money being parked in the US to hedge against currency risk - again, because we are the reserve currency and a flight to safety. \n\nWhat we are witnessing is a slightly weird, but fairly predictable rebalancing. Major investors are moving out of US tech sectors that are overvalued and heavily weighted in both QQQ and SPY. They are moving into beaten-down industrials (e.g. Alcoa, Oil stocks, transports), consumer discretionary (e.g. restaurants, beverages, hotels, *actual* casinos), and emerging market stocks. \n\nTL;DR: It's fine to expect some inflationary pressures in non-US markets moving forward, but US markets are relatively insulated due to how the open economy functions given the US Dollar is the reserve currency. \n\nSource: I have extensive graduate training in economic policy.

Please do your own research and don't come knocking at my door when you don't make gamestop money on Ford. Also this is my first DD after lurking for years so please be as mean as possible. Edited for formatting.\n\n\nSo we all know that EVs are the future and that someday we are all going to be driven around in Teslas, so you could dismiss the legacy automakers as boomer shit stuck in the past, but I think that the market has over-corrected for this and overlooked a couple things:\n\n* Ford has been stealthily morphing into a tech-centric automaker\n* Ford's fundamentals are still really solid\n* Ford's new management team gets it\n\nI'll go into detail into each below. Here are some ford financials from Yahoo finance to set up some context: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/key-statistics?p=F \n\n* Forward P/E: 10.53\n* P/S: 0.36\n* Mkt Cap: $46B\n\n\n**Factor 1: Ford understands where the auto market is going.**\nA couple years ago, when Ford announced that they were going to stop producing sedans for the US market, I thought they were smoking crack. Sedans still represent a thicc market segment. But nah, they kept around the high margin trucks and suvs and let GM, Honda, Toyota have the dwindling US sedan market so that they could focus their resources on developing next-gen products. And some of those are finally here and they are legit actually pretty good. \n\nThe Mach-E: $42k, 300mi range, 3.5 second 0-60. Fast charging. Not quite Tesla good yet but damn close. This is a legit viable product, and you don't get any of the Tesla customer service issues. If you factor in the $7500 federal tax credit, it's cheaper than a Model Y. \n\nElectric F150 coming soon: best selling truck in America getting an EV version. It's going to be good too. The legit info on this car is coming later this year most likely and it's going to be solid. They've already demoed it pulling a million pounds (which is BS because it was on rails so doesn't count - so we don't get a real tow cap number yet but we know it's yoked). And it's going to look like a real truck so they can capture the whole toxic-masculinity-but-my-wife-cares-about-climate-change market.\n\nThey own part of Rivian. Rivian gonna be dope af and if they can leverage Ford's manufacturing experience they could potentially skip a large part of the painful production ramp-up that Tesla went through. And Ford gets paid in the process and gets access to the tech Rivian develops. \n\nTesla's PE is like fucking 200. That's how wall street values tech companies and innovation companies. Share price is gonna go ape once the analysts figure out that Ford is a tech company that is merely funded by a legacy automaker dinosaur.\n\n**Factor 2: Ford's leadership gets it**\nMeet Jim Farley. He's like Jim Hackett, but palatable to the shareholders. What does he care about? Yeah, autonomous tech and EVs. Would you prefer he be focusing Ford's attention elsewhere? Didn't think so. https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/01/new-ford-ceo-jim-farley-announces-restructuring-and-executive-shakeup.html \n\n**Bear Case: Ford's Fundamentals Alone Under-Price it: They Make Cars People Actually Want**\nLord Elon told God-Conduit Cathie Wood on her podcast (it's on Youtube but I can't link it - search for Elon Cathie Wood Podcast and it's at 3:30) that EVs sales will comprise 1/3 of global auto sales by 2023-2025. That's crazy growth given that EVs were about 2% of US sales last year (I know, not fair to compare US to world but it's not the main point, just context). \n\nIf that growth rate holds we're looking at like 8-10 more years of ICE vehicle sales. Which ICE vehicles do Americans like? That's right, fucking TRUCKS and SUVs, the exact vehicles that are Ford's bread and butter. The F-150 is the best selling vehicle in America and has been for years. \n\nThis vehicle segment is super margin - the average sale price of an F150 is over $40k according to CarGurus (https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/price-trends/Ford-F-150-d337). People pay stupid money for these things and Ford will be happy to accommodate them.\n\nSo, let's assume that my thesis above is incorrect, and Ford has no future in the EV space and will do nothing milk the dying ICE Truck-Yeah market until the day they hit insolvency. How could we value them then?  \n\nFortunately, such a car maker actually exists and it's called fucking Fiat-Chrysler. They Yolo'd everything into the Murica-Fuck-Yeah market segment and will literally sell you a Hellcat powered anything - only car they make that doesn't have a V8 option is the fucking Pacifica - a minivan. These guys are lunatics and pre-Peurgot merger had absolutely no plan for adapting to the future of the auto market except for buying gas mileage credits from Tesla. Let's compare their stats to Ford from above: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FCAU.VI/key-statistics?p=FCAU.VI\n \n* Forward P/E: 5.78\n* P/S:  0.24\n* Mkt cap: $42B\n\nSo the market is literally pricing Ford right now quite similarly to Fiat-Chrylser. Ask yourself who's future strategy makes more sense. If Ford fucked up literally everything going forward, I think their valuation makes sense.

{"title": "Solid State Battery-tech/stock", "selftext": "Ok Guys, Listen Up. As You might know this is the last era of the lithium-battery. You know, that chargebale battery and the one and only reason why you have to charge your phone every 2 hours and your Tesla (who doesn‚Äôt have one these days?) after 400-500 km. Let‚Äôs not forget a battery‚Äôs purpose is to stores energy. The more energy you can store in a smaller battery, the happier we humans are. Energy=happiness.\n\nFinding a cost-effective and efficient solid-state battery for electric vehicles could prove equivalent to finding the golden fleece in Greek mythology. According to the legend, anyone who possessed the golden fleece would be considered a true ruler. According to the present technology, anyone who could develop a cost-effective and efficient solid-state battery would rule the EV world.\n\nA few listed companies are working on revolutionary Solid-State Batterys. Instead of LI-ion, Solid-State Batteries use solid electrodes and solid electrolytes. For the ones who never heard about these, use Opera or Google to DYOR.\n\nSolid-State Batteries promise, already today:\n\n\\- Twice the energy  \n\\- 1/100th of the size  \n\\- 6x faster charsing  \n\\- 10X longer lifetime  \n\\- Non-flammability\n\nThis new piece of 21th-century-technology will definitely evolve coming years. Elon Musk already called it the MOAB.\n\nNow let‚Äôs talk stocks. A few companies are working on a Solid-State Battery, expecting to bring it to the market within a few years. Today, much of the development work on solid-state batteries is performed with partnerships. Among the players are conventional Li-ion battery-cell manufacturers (i.e., Samsung SDI, LG Chem, A123 Systems), battery separator technology solutions suppliers (Asahi Kasei), and materials suppliers (Solvay, Umicore, etc.).\n\nQuantumScape  \nPanasonic  \nSamsung  \nLG  \nIonic Materials  \nBMW Solid  \nPower  \nToyota  \nIlika\n\nAccording to Yole D√©veloppement‚Äôs market forecast, mass production of solid-state batteries will begin by 2022 and represent less than 1% of Li-ion battery demand by 2025. This might explain the relative low interest from investors today, which might change when large solid-state battery manufacturing capacities start to be built.\n\nSamsung, LG, BMW etc are all searching for the Solid-State battery for own use, so that is not interesting for me to invest in; they already reached their market share. Today there are 2 stocks I want to discuss with you: Quantumscape and Ilika.\n\nYou might have heard about QuantumScape before. QS went to the moon ($10- $130) when Volkswagen announced it took an extra 20% stake in the battery manufacturing company (crazy times on the stock market back in the days). Now QS is stable between $40 - $50. Fair price for a company with no revenue, but a huge potential in the EV market. QS is already backed by $300 million worth of investment from Volkswagen, Bill Gates and hedge fund billionaire George Soros. Ilika is also a pioneer in solid state batteries, trading around $3-$4. Ilika has has two development programs:\n\n\\- Stereax: miniature batterys for MedTech\n\n\\- Goliath: solid-states for the EV and other battery-powered transportation The scope of growth is huge in both industries. Compared to QS and to see what‚Äôs happening with their stocks, lets only focus on the EV market. Ilika aligned a road map where the plan to start production of the Solid-State Battery in 2026, that‚Äôs the same period as the planning of QS. Ilika actually plans a pre-pilot this year and a construction pilot in 2024. For more information, DYOR.\n\nSo why is ILIKF trading $2-$4 and QS $40-$50?\n\nFounded by Stanford University scientists a decade ago, with financial backing from Volkswagen AG, QuantumScape became a public company in November after merging with Kensington Capital Acquisition Corp, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC). When the SPAC deal was announced in September the parties decided a $3.3 billion valuation was appropriate. Following a blistering stock-market run, QuantumScape is now worth more than 10 times that initial value. Those who bought shares in the Kensington SPAC in August have enjoyed a 1,060% return. QuantumScape‚Äôs prominent backers include venture capital firms Khosla Ventures and Kleiner Perkins, Microsoft Inc. cofounder Bill Gates, hedge fund billionaire George Soros‚Äôs Quantum Partners and investor Jeremy Grantham. JB Straubel, a former chief technology officer at Tesla, is on the board. These people know how to bring a company to the market and make it moon $$$.\n\nLooking at their financials and progress, QS and Ilika do not differ that much. They both have enough capital to fund the business processes for the next 5-7 years, and both planning to bring their product to market in 2025. To understand the difference we have to look in the type of investors of both companies and their strategy for production.\n\nThe difference is QS plans to build a giga-factory to manufacture their batteries, which asks for a huge investment (0,5 billion ‚Äì 750 million per GWh). That is the real reason why they are raising these amounts of capital. Ilika has chosen a different route. They will use the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre (UKBIC) as a first step before scaling up through an existing manufacturing company to get to the GWh. UKBIC is a key part of the Faraday Battery Challenge (FBC), a Government programme to fast track the development of cost-effective, high-performance, durable, safe, low-weight and recyclable batteries. Therefor Ilika doesn‚Äôt need the same capital investment to fund their growth.\n\nSo here is the point. Solid-State Battery technology is the future of battery. Ilika is growing in multiple industries including the EV market. Therefor I believe Ilike is a save and good investment for the long term. What are your thoughts on this? Is Ilika a good investment?", "id": "lrp9qv", "created_utc": 1614206695.0, "score": 51, "upvote_ratio": 0.8, "num_comments": 42, "comments": [{"body": "Once they figure out how to make graphene batteries efficiently, those will destroy the competition.
