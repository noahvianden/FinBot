{"title": "Seaworld Overvalued - SEAS", "selftext": "Hey,\n\nI believe SEAS (Seaworld) is overvalued.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fygo9x8dkkj61.png?width=810&format=png&auto=webp&s=61ba00cecbd5c3e637b88f6a277d45458fb10bc6\n\n Price Now: 41:35\n\nMy Target End of 2021: way lower. probably 20.\n\n**Background**\n\nSeaWorld Entertainment, Inc., operates 12 theme parks within the United States. They own the SeaWorld, Busch Gardens, Aquatica, Discovery Cove, Water Country USA, Adventure Island, and Sesame Place brands. Seaworld was originally the family entertainment division of Anheuser-Busch, and was spun out to Blackstone in 2009 when Anheuser-Busch was acquired by InBev. In 2013 the company was IPO‚Äôd to the public.\n\nIn 2013, a documentary called Blackfish was released that was highly critical of SeaWorld and their Orca shows (Shows where humans and killer whales swim in a pool together). This caused a lot of negative publicity for SeaWorld. Attendance at their parks dropped 5% in 2015, and they ‚Äúsuffered an 84 percent drop in its net second-quarter income‚Äù in 2015 (1).\n\nFrom 2016 to 2019 (before COVID) SeaWorld was consistently growing it‚Äôs operating profit. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Figure 1: Operating Profit from 2016 to 2019. We removed a one time $269 Million goodwill impairment charge from 2017 so that the graph is more clear. ](https://preview.redd.it/6162hu1yjkj61.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=748e679920d5545dfab5fa6ca4f6eb175e591799)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 2: Seaworld Price Chart. Drop from 2014 to 2015 corresponds to the blackfish documentary impact. The rise from the start 2018 to end of 2019 corresponds to the company becoming more profitable.](https://preview.redd.it/3mogvc62kkj61.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=419a650cd415723b39b66a2047579b80c8e0fb82)\n\n[Figure 3: Screenshot from income statement with the difference from 2019 to 2016 in each category.](https://preview.redd.it/2rr4wiwhvjj61.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=d82573b431019d6b0fa843574766508dd3e5e0ed)\n\nWhen we look at the income statement for SeaWorld for 2016 through 2019, we can see that admission revenue was fairly flat. The main contributions to the increase in operating profit was the decrease in operating expenses, and an increase in Merch sales.\n\nThis looks like the increase in profitability from 2016 to 2019 was more the result of cuttingExpenses than it was getting more revenue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Figure 4: Seaworld‚Äôs Operating Profit and Interest expense. ](https://preview.redd.it/c40arpdsvjj61.png?width=585&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2c3d5d0cc95e16989392208e79d9a6067783a3f)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeaWorld‚Äôs interest expense has a significant impact on it‚Äôs bottom line. In 2016 and 2017 their interest expenses were greater than their operating profit. Even assuming that profit in 2020 would equal 2019 levels, SeaWorld would be paying more than half their profits in interest expense.\n\nDue to the covid 19 Pandemic, Seaworld was forced to borrow an additional 727 Million dollars at between **8.75% and 9.5%**, further increasing their interest expense.\n\nThey have also gone through a bunch of CEOS, and currently have an interim CEO. Thier most recent earnings call they only talks about survivial and a depressing drive through sesame street experience.\n\n**Probability Of Bankruptcy**\n\nSeaWorld Entertainment Market Capitalization is relatively stable at the moment as compared to the past year. SeaWorld Entertainment reported last year Market Capitalization of 2.03 Billion. As of 02/18/2021, Tangible Asset Value is likely to grow to about 2.3 B, while Free Cash Flow is likely to drop slightly above 103.8 M.\n\nSeaWorld Entertainment Probability Of Bankruptcy is used to show its chance of financial distress over the next two years of operations under current economic and market conditions.\n\nWe used [Altman Z Score](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/credit/altmans-z-score-model/) to predict the probability of a firm going into bankruptcy within the next 24 months or two fiscal years.  According to Edward Altman algorithm based on five fundamental business ratios, Z score of SEAS is 0.3 which falls under distress zone resulting in a high probability of bankruptcy.   Additionally, we see a lot of actions from leadership to survive the pandemic such as raising more long term debts from their latest earning calls which would help to relieve their liquidity issue. However, we don‚Äôt see any long -term recovery actions to bump their business planned post covid from their latest earnings call which makes it still a big concern. As a result, we would rank the probability of  bankruptcy high to medium (80-85%)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions**:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygt0yziqwjj61.png?width=1221&format=png&auto=webp&s=e345ffca9471e83e2ad08892a23537a3204e70ca\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yn0hl99twjj61.png?width=359&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b6e3126e6c64dfdd7152f846c83107573da1c27\n\nSeaworld has earnings tomorrow 2/25 and is at an all time high. If the stock goes up and there isn't good news in the earnings, I **may** YOLO these:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ubl41pyuxjj61.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=79aaae2feb92ebf72f9ac71d7bb9c615f0ccece0\n\nEDIT: I deliberately posted the PLTR position because that's what I bought instead. I think buying anything bullish is straight up retarded, but the bearish stuff has wide bid-ask spread, and isn't as rewarding since it can't triple. so basically SEAS is a tendie free thing to avoid either way in my opinion, hence my lack of SeaWorld positions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "id": "lry7dt", "created_utc": 1614227586.0, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 45, "comments": [{"body": "99% of this sub is talking about green lines and mooning while this one is going üåàüêª on Shamu.

Vaccinations accelerating - J&J vaccine approved\n2. Herd immunity by end of April\n3. UK re-opens - flight bookings surge 300%\n4. Israel is re-opening\n5. Reflation = good for airlines\n6. $1.9T Stimulus\n7. Codeshare program + Project Oasis\n8. 80M shares short as of 02/12\n9. Price Target = $60\n\n**1.** **Vaccinations are accelerating**\n\n* Pfizer will have provided 120M doses by the end of March, and 300M doses by the end of July.\n* Moderna will have provided 100M doses by the end of March and 300M doses by the end of July.\n* Johnson and Johnson is prepared to provide 20M doses by the end of March, and 100M doses in the first half of 2021\n* This will translate to 130M Americans vaccinated by the end of March, and 200M Americans vaccinated by the end of April.\n\n[https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/02/23/pfizer-and-moderna-to-dramatically-increase-covid-19-vaccine-production-this-spring/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2021/02/23/pfizer-and-moderna-to-dramatically-increase-covid-19-vaccine-production-this-spring/?sh=1fb0f6d376c5)\n\n**2. Herd Immunity by End of April**\n\n* According to the CDC, only 1 in 4.6 COVID cases were actually reported: [https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/burden.html)\n* According to the CDC, 28M cases have been reported in the US: [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases\\_totalcases](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases_totalcases)\n* Therefore, 28M x 4.6 = 128M people have already had the virus and are immune\n* Therefore, 128M + 200M / 330M x 202M = 263M will be immune by the end of April. This is about 80% of the population.\n\n**3. UK Re-Opens: Flight Bookings Surge 300%**\n\nUK flight bookings surge: [https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/brits-rush-to-book-vacations-following-lockdown-announcement](https://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-news/brits-rush-to-book-vacations-following-lockdown-announcement)\n\nAs Bill Ackman states, there will be a surge in \"animal spirits\" when COVID restrictions ease causing people to schedule vacations and trips to elderly family members.\n\nAmazon's search engine ranker shows that [aa.com](https://aa.com/) has already been trending up over the past 90 days.\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.alexa.com\\/siteinfo\\/aa.com](https://preview.redd.it/hmfprpce2lj61.png?width=272&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bcd1bbae4bfbf1e9197fb76d594000562822f2e)\n\n**4. Israel is Re-Opening**\n\nIndividuals with a \"Green Pass\" are able to access gyms, hotels, and theaters.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-israel-int-idUSKBN2AL03U](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-israel-int-idUSKBN2AL03U)\n\n**5. Reflation = Good for Airlines**\n\nAs the economy re-opens, inflation will increase as Americans spend the money they have been saving. This will cause all prices connected to commodities to increase in price. So, even airline tickets will cost more, which means more revenue. Cramer has a great explanation on this: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/cramer-on-buying-growth-stocks-after-inflation-scare-shakes-up-market.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/cramer-on-buying-growth-stocks-after-inflation-scare-shakes-up-market.html)\n\n**6. $1.9T Stimulus Package**\n\nMore than 150 CEO's including American Airlines CEO signed a letter to Congress to pass the $1.9T stimulus package on Wednesday. The package is set to pass the House on Friday or Saturday. This could provide a big stimulus directly to AAL. [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/stimulus-update-more-than-150-ceos-urge-congress-to-pass-bidens-covid-relief-bill.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/stimulus-update-more-than-150-ceos-urge-congress-to-pass-bidens-covid-relief-bill.html)\n\n**7. Codeshare Program + Oasis Project**\n\nAmerican Airlines' codeshare program between JetBlue and Alaskan Airlines allows customers to schedule flights through either airline on each other's websites. This creates a streamlined process for the consumer without having to book with multiple airlines and also provides American Airlines with an additional revenue stream. [https://upgradedpoints.com/codeshares-and-airlines](https://upgradedpoints.com/codeshares-and-airlines)\n\nWhile the pandemic hit, planes that weren't flying were being refurbished within Project Oasis. The newly renovated cabins may allow American Airlines to bounce higher than peers after the pandemic. [https://thepointsguy.com/news/american-airlines-ceo-doug-parker-tpg-interview/](https://thepointsguy.com/news/american-airlines-ceo-doug-parker-tpg-interview/)\n\n**8. 80M Shares Sold Short as of 02/12/2021**\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.nasdaq.com\\/market-activity\\/stocks\\/aal\\/short-interest](https://preview.redd.it/5cmlqjrj2lj61.png?width=574&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8d3c6e7d7899907e743397172d3b6f21a0a63f0)\n\nAnd, the short volume has increased substantially in the past three days... short interest could be over 150M as of tomorrow.\n\n[https:\\/\\/fintel.io\\/ss\\/us\\/aal](https://preview.redd.it/cp0blppl2lj61.png?width=423&format=png&auto=webp&s=d20264d71db34ffa04ca49672a128243caa08158)\n\n**9. Price Targets**\n\nI believe AAL (13.96B) should be priced similarly to Southwest Airlines (35B) due to their unique positioning for a stimulus package and increased revenue from their codeshare programs. Therefore, with the increase in demand for all airlines stocks and to match the market cap of Southwest, I see a PT of $60 as being very possible. I think a short squeeze before March 19th can even get us there.\n\n**Disclaimer:** This is not financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor.

The story of Nokia is that of a modern day epic. Here's why:\n\n\"Nokia Bell Labs is an American industrial research and scientific development company owned by Finnish company Nokia. With headquarters located in Murray Hill, New Jersey, the company operates several laboratories in the United States and around the world.\"\n\n\\- 9 Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories, as well as 4 Turing Awards.\n\n\\- The C Programming Language, as well as Unix was developed here.\n\nWith the 5G/6G arms race heating up, it is time for the 100 year old think-tank to be leveraged once more.\n\n### TLDR: Nokia is going to be one of the 3 kings in the world of 5G/6G... which will be used in EVERYTHING that matters in the next decade and this is the absolute ground floor.\n\nAll data that I present is publicly available. By no means do I claim to be an expert, nor is this financial advice. This is simply observation and speculation.

Everything they do has purpose.\n\n\\- From the cryptocurrency community in the previous bull market, I have learned this, and scaled it into larger markets... The behaviors are the same, but even more predictable due to the dominance of algorithmic trading. Just trade \"whale\" for \"institution\".\n\n\\- Nokia is seen in a negative light by retail, and the whole GME/Robinhood farce has further smeared their image to traditional retail investors. Many investors are repulsed from this company.\n\n\\- We have seen the clients of Big Tech influencing geopolitics to an astounding degree in the past few years through social media and surveillance capitalism... I believe that financial institutions have now caught on and now are cashing out on social media to move the markets...\n\n\\- Forgive me if you have disdain for WSB and the \"Robinhood\" investors, but I believe that there is big money behind them... BlackRock, JPM, etc... They are a vehicle for change, and a perfect fall guy for market manipulation.\n\n\\- Some of the DD are likely released by BlackRock themselves... I've seen some of the account's post histories. \"Robinhooders\" are looked down upon, yet under the guise of anonymity, they can release DD that far exceeds any big name analyst report? It smells fishy!\n\n2 Possible threads of speculation:\n\n\\- Accumulation\n\n\\- Inst. ownership as of Q4 2020 is only 5.30%, shares float is 5 Bn... child's play to manipulate with high float. Other high growth companies that institutes are betting on have 90%+ inst. ownership.\n\n\\- Impulse Wave 1 was a test breakout... To gauge the retail demand levels. Institutions love to do this, and only create a melt up when an ideal motive wave can be created with public participation.\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n## FA:\n\n\"Have you ever wondered how you can enter the world of IoT or meet the increased requirements of the emerging 5G use cases? Are you in need of tools to seize the opportunities of 5G? Would you prefer to win new revenue with low risk and minimal investment, instead of spending CAPEX and time building an IoT network and developing new services?\n\nWelcome to Nokia WING, a managed service that offers operators the ability to support their enterprise customers with global IoT connectivity across borders and technologies. It is live today with a truly global footprint but also prepared for the challenges of tomorrow ‚Äì no matter what directions it is taking.\n\nThere is nothing else like WING on the market.\" - Nokia website\n\n\\- Like Blackberry, a comparison can be made to the mining sector. At the start of new bubbles, CapEx for juniors get filled very quickly.

My favorite type of technology!\n\n\\- The global market for Internet of things (IoT) end-user solutions is expected to grow to 212 billion U.S. dollars in size by the end of 2019. The technology reached 100 billion dollars in market revenue for the first time in 2017, and forecasts suggest that this figure will grow to around 1.6 trillion by 2025.\n\n\\- 5G/6G is the LIFEBLOOD of IoT.\n\n\\- \"5G is much more than just fast downloads; its unique combination of high-speed connectivity, very low latency, and ubiquitous coverage will support smart vehicles and transport infrastructure such as connected cars, trucks, and buses, where a split second delay could mean the difference between a smooth flow of traffic and a 4-way crash at an intersection.\"\n\n\\- What is the number 1 problem that EV wishes to solve right now? Completely independent self-driving. 5G/6G is part of the solution! Why is Elon Musk focusing on Starlink now? It is the solution for Tesla's biggest roadblock.\n\n\\- 5G infrastructures are the neurons for IoT!\n\n\\- 5G is huge. It is of UTMOST importance. Why would the US go to such lengths to cripple China's Huawei for YEARS? Huawei seems to be their number 1 target!\n\nKey contracts and partnerships:\n\n\\- The FIRST company contracted to set up internet on the moon. Partnering with SpaceX.\n\n‚ÄúWhy would astronauts on Earth have access to 5G at home, but not have the same access to the same technologies when they are on the Moon?‚Äù\n\nThierry Klein, head of Enterprise and Industrial Automation Research Lab at Nokia Bell Labs, is addressing the gap between communication technology on the Moon and technology astronauts have access to on Earth.\n\nIn October, Nokia was named a NASA partner for its Tipping Point technologies for the Moon program, receiving a $14 million contract to deploy the first LTE/4G communications system on the Moon.\n\n\\- 5G/6G will be essential for space travel... Sounds like ARKX will need to look into this one!\n\n\\- Dec. 1, 2020 - Nokia and AT&T extend Worldwide IoT Network Grid (WING) collaboration to deliver seamless IoT connectivity to enterprises around the world, and support upgrades to 5G. As IoT networks transition to 5G and with Nokia WING also supporting 5G network slicing, AT&T will be able to partition its 5G network into multiple networks that can deliver specific capabilities to its IoT customers and support various use cases.\"\n\n\\- Jan.14, 2021 - Nokia selected for U.S. Federal 5G Cybersecurity Project\n\n\\- Main collaborator for the Hexa-X 6G European Union Project... \"Being a 2.5-year project within EU‚Äôs Horizon 2020 ICT-52 program, Hexa-X is a consortium of 25 key players from adjacent industries and academia. Nokia has the overall lead and Ericsson the technical manager role in the project. Hexa-X is a broad collaborative initiative to frame the 6G research agenda and lay the groundwork for a long-term European investment in future wireless network technology.\" - Ericsson's website.\n\n\\- \"Google Cloud and Finland‚Äôs Nokia are teaming up to develop cloud-native 5G solutions for communications service providers and enterprise customers, the companies announced in a Thursday (Jan. 14) press release.\n\nThe companies plan to develop solutions that combine Nokia‚Äôs 5G operations and networking capabilities with Google Cloud‚Äôs AI, ML and analytics technologies.

Sources are varying and biased, and there needs to be more rigorous audits in this sector. However, you will get the idea:\n\n5G Hardware Market Share 2020:\n\n\\#1. Huawei - 28%\n\n\\#2. Nokia - 16%\n\n\\#3. Ericsson - 14%\n\n(These figures vary depending on the source, but it is clear that these 3 are the leaders by far)\n\nInvestors accumulate shares, Research companies accumulate patents.

Ericsson- 8,116\n\n\\#5. LG - 7,694\n\n\\#6. Nokia- 5,554\n\nThere is an argument for Standard-Essential Patents (SEP) ownership... supposedly, which patents actually matter, and Nokia owns about 3,000. I am no expert on IP law or 5G technology, but these figures gives me a rough estimate, and are an indicator to the larger picture. Robert L. Stoll from Faegre Drinker's report has some good secondary sources if you want to dig into this.\n\nA quick calculation of Value metrics:\n\n\\- Current Mcap of 23.35 Bn.\n\n\\- 16% market share of projected 664 Bn... Market size refers to the maximum total number of sales or customers your business can see, often measured over the course of a year.\n\n\\- 664 Bn x 0.16 = 106 Bn Revenue, assuming Revenue = Sales for now, 106 Bn/5 Bn shares = 21 SPS. Assuming P/S Ratio of 1, Market Value per Share = $21.00 USD by 2027.\n\n\\- Current price = $4, 21/4 = 5, so a 400% gain in 6 years based on a P/S Ratio of 1.\n\n\\- Tesla's current P/S ratio is 23.78, and Zoom had a high of 108.95 with the lowest being 25.83.\n\nDoes it sound right to you?\n\n üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\n## TA:\n\n\\- MACD has crossed over on lower time frames to bullish, and is converging on the 1D.\n\n\\- Current Price action shows fake consolidation... Motive Sequence has already begun.\n\n\\- The first run up to 10 must be wave 1 of the motive sequence, as this corrective wave has gone below the previous high.\n\n\\- Fib levels for wave 3 and 5 are around 14 and 21.\n\n## QA:\n\nFirst, the problem with options...\n\n\\- 142,040 Open Interest for options expiring 2/26/2021\n\n\\- 158,201 Open Interest for options expiring 3/05/2021\n\n\\- 434,917 Open Interest for options expiring 3/19/2021\n\nIt is possible that these need to expire before we move up again. However, all is not lost:\n\n\\- Heavy speculative call interest, with large short interest (in this case short volume) that are pushing up against major resistance levels can quickly pop higher. This indicates that they have consolidated and are getting ready for the next large move.\n\n\\- NOK had 370.0 ATM IV on Jan. 27, 2021, where the MM was forced to gamma hedge and we got the big but short-lived pop. Currently 50.2. This can be interpreted two ways. Low IV is good if organic growth and MM pinning pressure to ease, but abnormally low IV compared to the historic IV, where there is large negative gamma exposure means a big directional move is imminent.\n\n\\- Once again, call skew is turning bullish. Option interest always leads the price!\n\nInstitutional Behavior:\n\n\\- 442 institutional investors, and rising... More than Palantir Technologies...\n\n\\- Average 13F ranking rising (calculated from Total # of 13F shares and # of Funds holding)\n\n\\- institutional interest is GREATLY decoupled from stock price! Extremely bullish indicator. Price is what you pay, Value is what you get.\n\nQ4 2020 All 13F Filers Prior Change Hedge Funds 1 Prior Change\n\nIn top 10: 2 4 -50.0% 0 (0.0%) 1 (0.06%) -100.0%\n\nFunds Holding: 442 435 1.61% 78 (4.7%) 72 (4.48%) 8.33%\n\n13F shares: 264.118 Million 255.145 Million 3.52% 99.008 Million 100.991 Million -1.96%\n\n% Ownership 4.7021 4.5423 3.52% 1.7626 1.7979 -1.96%\n\nNew Positions: 76 83 -8.43% 15 11 36.36%\n\nIncreased Positions 126 121 4.13% 20 26 -23.08%\n\nClosed Positions 55 52 5.77% 10 19 -47.37%\n\nReduced Positions 130 106 22.64% 29 24 20.83%\n\nTotal Calls 16.306 Million 18.936 Million -13.89% 4.064 Million 7.473 Million -45.62%\n\nTotal Puts 15.368 Million 15.437 Million -0.45% 3.146 Million 3.439 Million -8.5%\n\nPUT/CALL Ratio 0.94 0.82 14.63% 0.77 0.46 67.39%\n\nI always look for the big players, and what they are doing with their money.

They are RUTHLESS! I have suffered for 2 months at their hands at Palantir!\n\n\\- The news will be out soon... This won't stay down here much longer. Information moves quick nowadays.

{"title": "Game Theory 101: why WSB will lose its tendies trying to squeeze stuff. Discussion", "selftext": "üöÄ GAMESTOP TO $130,000. SEE YOU IN THE KUIPER BELT!\n\n**Alright, listen up** **you damn dirty apes**\\*\\*. I'm going to walk you through why these attempted short squeezes are just a recipe to get your faces ripped off. I'm going to use bold on the important stuff so you'll read it before you see a banana or something shiny.\\*\\*\n\nThis monkey troop is an un-coordinated mess. To channel Henry Kissinger, ‚ÄúWho do I call if I want to speak to [r/WallStreetBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/WallStreetBets/)?‚Äù That's good for legal compliance, but let me explain to you why it will also prevent you from turning your memes into dreams.\n\n**1)** **The Prisoners' Dilemma** is a game theory classic. There are two prisoners who allegedly committed a crime together. If both prisoners snitch on each other, they'll both go to jail for a medium amount of time. If both prisoners keep quiet, it will be hard to prove they did anything wrong and they'll only go to jail for a little while. If one prisoner snitches but the other prisoner stays quiet, the prisoner who didn't snitch gets the book thrown at them and goes to jail for a long, long time.\n\nThis is the position the WSB diamond hands gang is in. If none of you sell, the stock moons. If all of you sell, the stock gets nuked. If some apes sell and other apes don't, the ones who sell make money and the ones who don't get caca shoved down their throats. **Each monkey on WSB has a strong incentive to have hands that are just a little bit less diamond than all the other monkeys' hands.**\n\n**2) Recursion. Let us assume for a moment that every monkey in this troop decides that GME really is going to $1,000.** **Every monkey thinks that when GME hits $1k, all the other monkeys will sell and then the price will crash.**\n\n**Smart monkeys will see the $1,000 top coming.** **They'll use their prehensile tails to enter sell orders at $999.** But then they'll realize that other monkeys will probably do the same thing, meaning GME's peak will really be at **$999**. So monkeys get a little smarter, and enter a sell order at **$998.** But now GME's only going to peak at $998, so monkeys enter sell orders for **$997. The same logic leads us to sell orders at $996, then $995, then $994, and all the way down to a more reasonable valuation.** The squeeze never gets squoze.\n\n**3) Why was Volkswagen different?** You've heard breathless accounts of how the VW shorts called up Porsche crying and begging for relief. Don't wait for Melvin to call all 4 million of us begging for a deal. Porsche bought up a huge chunk of VW stock. Porsche was the only prisoner; it wasn't going to snitch on itself. Porsche didn't have a recursion problem. **Porsche was an 800-pound gorilla. Porsche didn't have to keep an entire troop of howling monkeys in line to squeeze the shorts.**\n\n**TL;DR: 80 10-pound monkeys can't squeeze as hard as one 800-pound gorilla.**\n\nDisclaimer 4 modz: Just saying that WSB is at a structural disadvantage when short squeezing, not that WSB should coordinate more.

{"title": "Energy Squeeze Play - Oil Price Crash Anniversary", "selftext": "Real DD from JP Morgan Quant on Oil / Energy Equities  \n\n\"According to JPMorgan quant *Kolanovic*, the biggest short squeeze yet is set to begin next month as systematic funds, momentum chasers, trend followers and the CTA community in general cover their legacy shorts in the energy sector and go long. CTA funds have been adding Energy exposure. The reason is that 12-month momentum turned positive on Oil, and going forward signals will remain solidly positive. However, this is in the context of a huge systematic net short overhang in the energy sector. In other words, energy - in all forms be it oil or energy stocks - remains the most hated sector across all investors. \n\nThe catalyst that forces the squeeze is the anniversary of the collapse in oil prices at the start of the Covid crisis, at which point various vol metrics followed by vol-control funds will reset and they will have no choice but to go long. That - *and this is the punchline of Kolanovic's thesis*¬† \\-¬† will \"change in mid-March, when the momentum signal for energy equities turns positive\" which is also a gentle hint from the JPM quant to all the redditors out there: if you want to spark a truly historic short squeeze, one which forces systematic shorts to not only cover but to go long, do it where it hurts and buy some energy stocks. \n\nKolanovic was kind enough to even give you the timing: you have about a month to do so because JPM's model momentum factor **\"will need to rebalance in March by closing \\~20% of its allocation to Energy equity shorts, and adding \\~2% to energy longs, for a \\~22% net buying in Energy.\"**\n\nWhat is the quantitative significance of these flows? Well, the Croatian quant calculates that if one roughly assumes that there is about \\~$1Tr in equity long-short quant funds and that half of these funds are not sector neutralized, **\"the flows could be quite significant, roughly $20-$30bn.\"** It could be far, far more. As shown in the chart below, the ratio of energy shares shorted vs all other S&P 500 shares shorted, closely followed the commodity supercycle. And, remarkably, **the most recent number of shares shorted for energy was 4 times the S&P 500 average**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k8tmabq70pj61.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa83fd4081396649eb5e4964124ce9f1c0e2aedf\n\n We then said that since vol-control funds are some of the dumbest money around and their actions can be anticipated well in advance. It now appears that said frontrunning of the CTA squeeze officially kicked off yesterday because according to Goldman prime on Monday, Feb 22, on the same day the bank saw the largest net selling in US Macro Products since Jan 27, the biggest increase in ETF shorts since November (offset however by aggressive buying in single names), **it also observed the official start of sector rotation into energy stocks, as \"energy stocks saw the largest 1-day net buying in more than two years\" a +5.8 sigma move.**\n\n*Here are the market details from Goldman's Prime Service for Feb 22:*\n\n**The GS Prime book saw the largest $ net selling since Jan 27th (-1.5 SDs vs. the average daily net flow of the past year), driven by short sales outpacing long buys 5 to 1.**\n\n **US equities ‚Äì Largest $ net selling since Jan 27th (-2.0 SDs) driven by short sales in Macro Products**\n\n* **Macro Products** (Index and ETF combined) saw the largest net selling since Jan 27th.¬† Macro Products have been net sold in 9 of the past 10 trading days.\n* **ETF shorts increased +4.3%** ‚Äì the largest 1-day increase since November ‚Äì driven by Large Cap, Technology, and Corporate Bond ETFs. ETF shorts have increased +9% week/week (+25% YTD) and now make up 21.4% of the non-Index US short book, the highest level on our record going back to 2012.\n* **Single Names were modestly net bought overall** (+0.2 SDs) ‚Äì Sector flows were split driven by net buying in Energy (long buys > short covers), Real Estate (short covers > long sales), Comm Svcs (long buys > short sales), and Health Care (long buys > short sales) vs. net selling in Info Tech (short sales > long buys), Materials (long sales), Financials (short sales > long sales), and Consumer Disc (long sales > short covers).\n\n**Energy stocks saw the largest 1-day net buying in more than two years (+5.8 SDs), w**hile Info Tech was the most net sold sector, the $ net selling was relatively modest (-1.0 SDs) driven by short sales.\n\n* **FAAMG (GSTMTMEG) ‚Äì Collectively the TMT Mega Caps were modestly net bought yesterday,** driven by risk-off flows with short covers outpacing long sales 1.4 to 1. The group had been net sold for four straight days (8 of the past 10) coming into yesterday ‚Äì aggregate long/short ratio (MV) of the group had declined -33% MTD to 14.6, which is in the 23rd percentile vs. the past year.\n* **Most net bought industries** ‚Äì Oil, Gas & Consumable Fuels, Entertainment, Specialty Retail, Road & Rail, REITs, Food & Staples Retailing, Media, Household Durables\n* **Most net sold industries** ‚Äì Interactive Media & Svcs, Software, Capital Markets, Internet & Direct Marketing Retail, Chemicals, IT Svcs, Hotels, Restaurants & Leisure, Food Products\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dqv95o3n0pj61.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d76efa6f2518551b9496e4a9dbdcf115ad76063\n\n**Position:**\n\n**$XOM $MRO $OXY OTM Calls for \\~Q3**\n\n**$NRGU**", "id": "lshq22", "created_utc": 1614289392.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 40, "comments": [{"body": "long shell, chevron, bp.  these guys have been ticking up and bp was actually green today", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "Same.

You  can continue to place buy and sell stock orders, as well as some option  strategies. **This list is as of February 25, 2021, 4:00 PM ET.**\n\n**Symbols: GME**\n\n  \n\n* All stocks are marginable (requirement = 100%).\n* Short selling is not allowed at this time.\n* There are no limitations on long calls and long puts for these stocks.\n* Custom spreads are not allowed,  but standard spread orders are. Spread orders allowed include:  Verticals, Back/Ratio, Calendar, Diagonal, Straddle, Strangle, Covered  Stock, Collar, Butterfly, Combo, Condor, Iron Condor, Vertical Roll,  Collar with Stock, Double Diagonal and Double Calendar.\n* Opening orders on short  individual options are not allowed with the exception of cash-secured  puts or covered calls, which must be placed through a broker.\n* If you currently own stock in  one of these securities and wish to place a covered call, you must do so  with a broker. Please be aware that wait times to speak with a broker  may be longer than normal due to current market conditions.\n* If you have no position and wish  to both buy stock and sell calls against it, you may enter it as a  covered stock (buy/write) order online.\n* We may also implement additional requirements on the opening of option trades that expire 2/26.\n\nPlease keep in mind that security requirements/strategy limitations  can be added and may change at any time, without notice due to  volatility or other market conditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nref:\n\n[https://www.tdameritrade.com/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page](https://www.tdameritrade.com/td-ameritrade-trading-restrictions-stocks.page)", "id": "lsk22c", "created_utc": 1614295745.0, "score": 34, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 42, "comments": [{"body": "That is understandable.
