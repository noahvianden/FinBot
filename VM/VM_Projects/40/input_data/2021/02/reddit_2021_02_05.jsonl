{"title": "AMD 90c options any date at least 3 weeks out", "selftext": "\nA DD I found on WSB from u/drrona but Aligns with my TA findings as well. Thought I‚Äôd share here as I believe it shows a great buying opportunity for AMD especially in the next coming weeks.\n\n# Fundamentals:\n\nTheir latest ER:\n\n**Crossed $3 billion in sales threshold for the first time, INCREASING YOY by 52%**\n\n**Full year sales of $9.76 billion**\n\nServer revenue doubled year over year which is absolutely incredible because that means they are actually going toe to toe with the big boys like IBM.\n\nMassive increase in guidance. They‚Äôre **expecting 37% growth** this year.\n\nSo why did they drop from their ER? Well, it was because of next-gen chip shortages through the first half of 2021. But let‚Äôs be real here, this is a joke compared to the issues Intel is facing with their next-gen.\n\nObviously, we‚Äôd prefer if they never had a shortage, but I mean if you‚Äôre gonna have a problem it might as well be this one. This news is LITERALLY SAYING, ‚Äúhey we have too many orders and we can‚Äôt keep up sorry, we‚Äôll get it to you ASAP‚Äù\n\nImagine thinking this company isn‚Äôt going to bounce back and go to new ATH in the next month or two.\n\nOur queen, Lisa Su, said ‚Äúthere will be added capacity‚Äù in the second half of the year. This is perfect, because that means by the time next holiday season comes around they‚Äôll be good to go. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about these shortages. They are running at full capacity and we should expect their sales to increase throughout the year.\n\n**Some loser (**u/aatop**) decided to call out Market Share issues in my last post so here's a section just for him:**\n\nIntel gained back 0.7% of market share in Q4 across the CPU market as a whole. Whoop de doo!\n\n**In the last month ALONE, AMD gained back 3%.** Here's a little business lesson. Ups and downs happen. No growth company is going to have growth every single month/quarter. I don't care who they are. There are hiccups. Don't let some negative nancys make you believe that a hiccup means AMD's market growth is ending.\n\n**AMD actually GAINED on Intel in the CPU server secto**r. What does that tell you? That **boomers are actually converting to AMD** for their company. And we all know that these boomer companies have all the money for now.\n\n# Technicals:\n\nFor those of you who care about lines on a chart, I got you as well.\n\nWe really have two things to look out for. We have a resistance (that used to be a strong support) at 88. But we‚Äôre basically there right now.\n\nIn addition, the last few weeks before ER, we were in that 89-97 channel. What does that mean? Well, once we get going here **AMD will shoot up to $97 and from there we can retest ATH.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49t9dzxqghf61.png?width=1988&amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;s=9a45e5768cdd5fad74cfa67b2544f46065135d47\n\nFor more squiggly lines, the MACD is about to cross the signal line so we could see some bullish sentiment here. And of course the RSI is near the bottom of the range, but honestly who cares about that anyway.\n\n**Positions: 4/16/2021 100c, 97.5c üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**\n\nThis is not financial advice. I am not a professional. **I just really like the stock.**\n\n** My positions are 19 Feb 21 90c as I expect a leg up next week or the following into the 95$ territory range (expected profit - 150% if it hits 95)**\n\nPlease discuss below", "id": "ld68zo", "created_utc": 1612528521.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 41, "comments": [{"body": "I really like the stock and want to buy... but what about the issues with production/supply?

Some of my personal highlights:\n\n* Continued top-line (128%) and bottom-line growth (6% unadjusted net profit margin - worth noting that the company has at least doubled revenue every year of its existence, even before Covid).\n* Monthly churn of 0.76%. It's hard to overstate how stellar this is, especially for a company targeting individuals. Netflix churn rate is between 2-3% currently (the lowest it has ever been, while other streaming competitors hover between 4-10%).\n* Each additional member has fantastic contribution margins thanks to their platform business. \n* Members complete an average of 21 workouts per month. Not the sign of a dissatisfied customer base (Net Promoter Score is 90).\n* They continue innovating with new products and classes (Pilates, strength training, Tread, pre-recorded session) at a much faster pace than their competition\n* Fantastic reviews for the company culture ( [Peloton Company Culture | Comparably](https://www.comparably.com/companies/peloton) ) which helps them continue to attract top talent, further fueling innovating and product growth, resulting in happy customers. Just in January 2021, they have hired new VPs for:\n   * IT and Supply Chain (from Juul Labs and AWS)\n   * Talent Management (former Amazon HR Director)\n   * Software Architecture (ex Facebook and Google)\n   * Executive Development (former Starbucks)\n   * Global Brand Marketing (former WeWork - I know, I know, but you can't deny that the WeWork branding was on point)\n   * Content (ex ESPN)\n   * Platform (ex Spotify)\n* International opportunity is just beginning. It's already one of the top ranked fitness apps in Germany and UK, and they have many more countries they can expand into\n\nTheir story reminds me a lot of Netflix, who have built up a highly competitive platform with great financials despite a huge increase in competition. Peloton's competitors are barely just getting started and I don't see them catching up.\n\nI want to put more money in this company, but would be great to hear some contrarian opinions.

Peloton, like many companies, has benefited greatly with people working from home much more than ever before. That being said, there is a huge open question as to whether that will continue after COVID, and whether when people begin to be able to do more outside and in public, will they continue to buy the service? With the vaccine now in distribution and production, there is basically a time limit on how much more benefit Peloton will have from COVID effects, and if people do not receive their bikes before the vaccine is widely distributed, will they cancel orders? Will they continue to subscribe?\n\nWhen you think about apple or Nvidia, there may be supply constraints, but everyone is still going to want the latest iPhone even if they have to wait 2 months.

The flu is very similar to COVID in that we do see yearly mutations and have to adjust vaccines every year accordingly. I would say the more likely expectation is that COVID does stay around, causes a few thousand or ten thousand deaths each year and we accept it. I mean, the US didn't start wearing masks after some large flu seasons with 80,000 deaths (potentially twice as large as \"normal\"), and so to think that a few thousand more deaths each year from covid will result in a fundamental shift is somewhat na√Øve (IMO). \n\nThis is obviously a pretty callous response, but think about something like seatbelts. Car manufacturers put alert sensors for the front seats and not the back seats. This isn't because sensors for the back seats would not save lives, but rather the cost is higher than the benefit of the lives saved, and no one really makes much of a fuss.\n\nI don't mean to say there will not be SOME permanent effects, but there is a very large open question as to the extent of those changes, and some of those changes may have unknown effects. For instance, right now people are working from home and going out to eat less. Even if we expect more WFH after covid, that could actually end up increasing social spending in restaurants and activities. People who WFH may be more likely to go out and do activities in order to get social interaction that they otherwise may have gotten in the office.\n\nEdit: I do want to clarify, I think there is potentially some upside long term for peloton if certain things happen.
