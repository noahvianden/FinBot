I've read similar posts to my question but I still have no idea what to do and I'd appreciate any input!\n\nI bought 1 Sundial Call. Expires 7/16, $0.5 Call. Break even is $1.55, the average cost is $1.05, so I'm ITM. \n\nMy original plan was to ride this option out until the summer - maybe see a bump after 4/20 and as more states legalize marijuana - and hope it continues rise. But after reading some DD and other posts on here, it seems like weed stocks, or at least Sundial, is about to see a big crash like a pump and dump. \n\nThere's 172% implied volatility, and the Delta is .9839...which I think means the value of my option is almost moving directly in line with the price of the stock. And the high IV means something crazy could happen with this stock/option very quickly, like a massive dip. (Does that check out?)\n\nPeople seem to recommend selling the option and collecting the profit versus exercising the option. Even if I could exercise & get the stock at a good price now ($1.55/share with my premium included), people seem to think it will dip and I could always get in and exercise a new option at a later date.\n\nSo - how would you look at my situation? I could hold it through the weekend and see what happens...I think it could get up to $5/share, I've even heard $10 before a crash. But I've been wrong so many times before - maybe sell this option Friday, or even tomorrow? Or just stop overthinking it and hold it until 7/16? \n\nI'm a noob, I have major FOMO, this is potentially my first success with options and I don't want to screw this up!

Resonant ($RESN) makes products for mobile and IoT devices that connect through 5G.

Currently, per their Q3 2020 10-Q, they have enough cash to last through Q2 of 2021, not that far out from now. \n\nI tried to find some information on 5g roll out to see if Resn can grow significantly enough while meeting their cash needs, and I can't find a great answer.

I do not believe that website considered any potential covid pullback in development either. \n\nResn is earning revenue based on royalty. It appears to be a prepaid amount of $9m with Murata, exclusive until March 2022. This is bad news because they need to increase revenue by 10x in order to be a sustainable company at their current expenditures. Their only hope is to find enough bankers to push the through the bad spot with some miraculous forecast showing how ISN can earn tens of millions in the next few years. \n\nThe upcoming 10-k will be very illuminating.

Ultimately, I'm unable to truly understand why ISN and Xbar are unique, with information being scarce/vague or technically barred out (i.e. reading the patent filings). The products of themselves do not sound revolutionary to people like me. ISN simply sounds like a data driven / AI driven approach to implementing RF to products, which bigger companies like broadcom will have more data to run with. I cannot decipher how Xbar competes over Fbar either. \n\nSpeaking on mass production, I am very curious how they will go about manufacturing. If they are sourcing out to another manufacturer, they may ramp up production quicker but with more costs. If they require custom or special equipment, the manufacturing process may not be online until 2-5 years out. This means the liquidity risk isn't quite solved by the ATM offerings and they may miss part of the 5g roll out. \n\nIt's an interesting play and I appreciate the DD.

They position themselves as a partner which provides a solution to decrease the development costs of their clients (big players, small players and new entries).  \nFor me, this is the major competitive advantage of RESN and overtime their IP will continuously grow, get a prove of concept with 5G and build a reputation to be the partner for the next generations of RFs which are required for 6G, etc. (= ARM business model).", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "This is a really good point you've brought up that I don't think many people realize about RESN.

You are right, RESN comes with risk.  But when I read that Murata Manufacturing opened up a partnership with Resonant, that spoke volumes to me.  Murata Manufacturing is a multi-billion dollar Japanese electronics manufacturer that makes electronics components like capacitors, inductors, RF filters, etc.  Murata has been in business for over 70 years and has over 65,000 employees.  If there is one thing the Japanese know, it's electronics.\n\nLast October, Resonant's XBAR techology passed a major milestone set by Murata.  Here is Resonant's CEO, George Holmes, talking about this accomplishment during the last earnings call (i.e., November 10, 2020):\n\n\"I think for us, the key thing is, we have validated this technology \\[XBAR\\] with the largest filter manufacturer \\[Murata\\], they have validated the parts, do what we said they would do, they've evaluated the fact that it can be manufactured through the initial packaging requirements for these devices. And they completed initial reliability. And they know they can take it and ramp it into production.\"\n\nSo basically, Murata's involvement is reducing our risk to invest in RESN.  Morever, Murata is bringing Resonant into the final stretch, i.e., Murata will help Resonant manufacture its XBAR filters in commercial volumes.  So I don't have to sit and wait 1-2 years to see if things *might* work out.  The remaining risk is how well the market accepts Resonant's XBAR filter technology, especially in view of competing technologies.  But I think the XBAR filter technology is pretty disruptive.  Moreover, the CEO discussed an initial customer for XBAR filters that could represent an opportunity for Resonant to earn $100 million revenue per year:\n\n\"I should also highlight that our initial XBAR customer has the market dominance to represent a market potential of over $100 million in annual revenue for Resonant. We're feeling really good about the progress and validation we're getting from the 5G market. The opportunities and non-mobile that we are engaged with for Wi-Fi and infrastructure  applications are focused keenly on XBAR's ability to deliver the  performance necessary at high frequency and wide bandwidth.\"\n\nHaving said all this, volume manufacturing of XBAR filters is not expected until the end of 2021, possibly Q1-2022.  There is a risk that Resonant may have to do another shelf offering (i.e., issue shares) to carry them to this point.

Where it gets interesting is that their cost of products and services decreased by 10.47%, their cost of revenue decreased by 5.39%, and this resulted in a 39.28% **increase** in their gross margin. They were also able to shave 7.8% off their operating expenses while increasing their operating income by **239%**.

Think of the amount of TV’s, smartphones, home stereos, etc that are being sold that use these two technologies. Consider the recent iPhone “super cycle” as one example to put into perspective how many devices will be using Dolby’s technology. Also consider that the demand for premium home entertainment has increased due to people spending more time at home. One other thing is that there is a higher demand from e-commerce platforms for audience-engaging content, which is increasing sales of Dolby Vision.

{"title": "8th grade research project: $NVDA", "selftext": "Swear to god if the automod removes this... \n\nAlright listen up retards. NVDA is going to print at earnings. \n\n#Retard Analysis\nOver the last three quarters, Nvidia EPS growth averaged 81%. They have earnings on the 24th, probably going to do well. CHRISTMAS could have some helpful effect as more people get into PC gaming. Especially with the shortage of PS5 and Xbox X that could have pushed some over the edge to switch. Regardless it would be a minor, but still positive impact. \n\n#Expanding Business \nLooking at Q3 2020 reports we can see some great news in expanding their business. Saw revenue and sales up 57%, a new record for them. \n\n* \"Launched the NVIDIA® EGX Intelligent Edge Computing Platform to bring accelerated AI to retail, manufacturing, telecommunications, logistics and other industries, with Walmart, BMW, NTT East, Procter & Gamble and Samsung Electronics among early adopters\". \n \n* USPS is going to use their AI tech to improve packaging process. \n\n* Loads of updates to software and companies adding RTX support showing they are becoming a standard in the industry. \n\n* The push forward on AI with self driving that is surely to increase going forward long term. \n\n* Their data center division revenue passed their gaming division and we all know data is the gold mine *PLTR autist PTSD*. Data center sales increased 162%.\n\n#Red Hat\nBut the item im most interested in is the Red Hat collab they are starting. They are trying to get more involved with 5G telecom market by making virtualized 5G RAN networks using their GPUs. Retardedly put, they want to simplify how current telecom traffic works and make it more harmonized: to bring down maintenance and management costs; increase flexibility; allow multiple vendors to work on the same hardware and share resources. Further, Red Hat is going to become a major player in the cloud services industry. Azure and AWS just don't have the same capabilities as Red Hat's open source infrastructure and having a good relationship with NVDA looks great for future projects.   \n\n#Semiconductor shortage easing\nThe world is coming off the end of a semiconductor shortage that was showing some recovery before COVID. Likely there will be no shortage going further into this year, maybe even early as Q2. Many of the car manufactures have been feeling the effects of the semi conductor shortage, even having to shut down factories temporarily before the situation improves. Bodes well for NVDA, supply is constricted and the pent up demand will blow its metaphorical load heavily at NVDA and other semis. \n\n#Bear case\nThe only hiccup: ARM merger deal is running into problems from anti-trust complaints by competitors. Likely to not happen when China reviews it and says no. The merger would make ARM US based and have the same US restrictions on exporting tech to Huawei or other blacklisted companies. Same thing happened with Qualcomm and N_X_P (automod removing small cap tickers) semiconductors. But on the off chance it does go through from both 1) The US taking a different stance towards China and 2) NVDA convincing regulators that ARM would still have impartiality for how it does business, the upside is massive. Not too concerned with it not happening since NVDA will adapt and move on. Its more of a bonus to NVDA and would only add to their underlying business that is already doing very good.\n\n\n#What the big money is doing\n\nIncreased from 150 hedges funds with NVDA in their top 10 holdings to 218 in Q3 2020.\n\n3% increase in institutional ownership from Q2 to Q3 2020\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/eGmb4cy\n\nThey are mostly buying more and some are trimming their positions slightly. Big bois are cool with it so you can be confident that ThE hEdGe FuNdS wOnT bUrN yOu 🤡🤡🤡.\n\n\n#TA for mentally ill\nHas been largely stagnant since September, just now hitting new highs. Summarized crayons TA: Some major resistance at ~590 and just broke it and has been holding for the last 2 days. RSI is a little over bought, Id be guessing there is some sideways action for a couple days and then a run up and beat at earnings.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/zAQoat2\n\n#Positions\n2/26 650C\n\nFuck you, this is financial advice because I want more people to go yachting with after 🚀🚀.
