The thing is, 3M is so broadly present in the sectors that will be invested on by the government that it is nearly impossible for it not to benefit. It’s like that awkward friend that you knows everyone around you so he goes to all the parties and stuff but you don’t really know know them and just awkwardly say hi, but he seems to be really close to everyone you know just not you for some reason… ya feel? \n\nAnyways, offering EV battery solutions, mostly insulating materials; and we know how hot that sector is right now.\n\nBut not only EVs will benefit, 3M is all around the manufacturing industry with abrasives, paints, bonding and more. Even touching the Broadcom sector.\n\nWhat I mean is, when Biden passed this bill, 3M execs bought a Beverly Hills house for each one of their dog’s toys. And these are rich dogs.

The best part is the price of the contracts, with 190 next week contracts being merely around $30. With the movement of this stock Friday morning, I am sure the stock will rally with this incredible catalyst. \n\nPOSITION\n21 190C 11/19\n2 Shares\n\nEDIT: TL;DR: Buy Mmm, go boom Monday cause bill and Brandon", "id": "qof941", "created_utc": 1636252336.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 47, "comments": [{"body": "I have my own three M's for Monday Molly, Mushrooms and Morphine.", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Fair choice.

It's a great stock but it's extension, along with Elon's tweets over the weekend, as well as his options expiring soon IMO gives it at least a chance to pullback in the short term.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$TSLA](https://preview.redd.it/r3al0csxm5y71.png?width=1836&format=png&auto=webp&s=66a329e60a815156baf654aa0572b6f519404246)\n\nNow comes the kicker, despite it's largest holding screaming higher $ARKK is still on a downwards trend. The rest of the underlying holdings look like dogshit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$Roku](https://preview.redd.it/3qp78ua0n5y71.png?width=1607&format=png&auto=webp&s=d650b046260c3a530bfb6ab39040a6768607ac65)\n\n[$PATH](https://preview.redd.it/gm6sf290n5y71.png?width=1607&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f890a8f9f448b2f30f84778ede55a2e86812301)\n\n[$Z](https://preview.redd.it/736vse90n5y71.png?width=1607&format=png&auto=webp&s=8583d168760348a4157848c207f2d8add9124b01)\n\n[$HOOD](https://preview.redd.it/kc3tn890n5y71.png?width=1607&format=png&auto=webp&s=df7d252717158e460293b1af7f2a9e6421d93778)\n\n[$TDOC](https://preview.redd.it/tjtkj790n5y71.png?width=1607&format=png&auto=webp&s=97152340e4a287e5fb591435a44101cca3c09415)\n\n[$ZM](https://preview.redd.it/f4233f90n5y71.png?width=1607&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2659c0f76c0a4fdd7596eaed05ffa1d42aae6a0)\n\nI think the only holdings I sort of like is $COIN (long it) and $U. I believe we saw some liquidations in things like $Z and $PTON this week.\n\nThe question is if there is any sort of mean reversion on $TSLA would the selling $ARKK would be forced to do lead to further liquidations in some of it's shittier holdings and ultimately lead to some Bill Huang type shit?\n\nI am taking a stab at this Monday as I think it's a good risk reward. I'll be using options (duh) to structure this trade:\n\n**$ARKK Short Jan 120 Put + 2 x Long Jan 110 Put.**\n\nI believe this a a good way to structure it. If I'm wrong and the teflon doesn't crack the trade is a small credit, if I'm right and it tanks then I obviously make some. Biggest loss would be if it trades sideways rest of the year, e.g maybe $COIN has some fucking blowout earnings and keeps it stable. I did think about changing the strike date to Feb to avoid a possible Santa Claus rally, but then again if I think my timing is right then Jan should be fine.", "id": "qomc4n", "created_utc": 1636283023.0, "score": 28, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 48, "comments": [{"body": "She’s either going to be the smartest person on earth or the dumbest.
