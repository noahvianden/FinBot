{"title": "Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation AND Analysis (Q3 Week 6) - $NVDA, $WMT, $HD, $LOW, $BABA, $SE, $M, and More", "selftext": "**Historical Post Earnings Moves MEGA Compilation AND Analysis (Q3 Week 6) - $NVDA, $WMT, $HD, $LOW, $BABA, $SE, $M, and More**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhat's poppin' bull gang, hope you all managed to escape meme week with your portfolios intact! The name of the game this week is Retails Giants and Chinese Tech, and it’s here where we’ll find some of our most lucrative opportunities. Although it may not seem like it, some of the companies in these sectors have extremely large historical moves, meaning we’ve got the potential to make some serious dough. We’re also approaching holiday season, meaning that many retailers will give adjusted guidance on their calls in light of the supply chain issues that have been plaguing the globe, adding to the intensity of these already large moves. Let’s get into it!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#The Spreadsheet\nTo aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eV9BTySXfVbMnVZFp5IfkaYf_xETjYyplJh_r-SLMjg/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eV9BTySXfVbMnVZFp5IfkaYf_xETjYyplJh_r-SLMjg/edit?usp=sharing) instead!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays\n\nBelow I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **The premiums on $NNOX are intoxicating.** Options are pricing around a 17% move at the time of writing, but historically $NNOX only moves 9%. Unfortunately for us, the sample size on this company is small, so we need to tread a little more carefully than usual. Regardless, the most $NNOX has ever moved post earnings is 18%, meaning even if we do get a “maximum” move, we won’t lose much money. I will likely opt to sell a 20/28 strangle once I conduct all little more research into the company later this week. I want to see if I can uncover any reasons regarding ***why*** the premiums are so high.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **$FL options will be extremely cheap come Friday.** Currently, the options are pricing an 8.3% move relative to the historical move of 9.3% , making them relatively efficient. Given that volatility doesn’t inflate throughout the week, these options should become extremely cheap by Friday since theta will murder the extrinsic value on them. Footlocker is no stranger to large moves, and if we can enter a lotto strangle for cheap Thursday before close, we could be looking at a handsome return come Friday morning. A straddle will currently run you $460, but by Friday this number may be closer to $300. If that’s the case, I’ll roll the dice on this one - I like my odds.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Chinese tech give us an awesome collateral play opportunity!** $KW£B is a high liquidity ETF consisting of all of the Chinese tech stocks who report this week. If it behaves anything like American tech does during earnings week, there should be a clear directional move in the entire ETF. If we’re bullish or bearish on Chinese tech as a whole, we should look to go long or short on $KW£B instead of any of the individual tickers in order to mitigate our risks and generate significantly greater profits. For more information on this type of play, check out my in-depth writeup on collateral plays [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#Summary and Conclusion\n\nWe've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eV9BTySXfVbMnVZFp5IfkaYf_xETjYyplJh_r-SLMjg/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If you don’t see any appealing trades, use [collateral plays](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays) to dynamically alter your risk profile for a larger potential payout!
