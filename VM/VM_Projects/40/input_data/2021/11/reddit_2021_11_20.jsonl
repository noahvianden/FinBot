By closing the domain gap between virtual and real, the trained robots can better adapt in the wild because the conditions in which they were trained are similar to those in which they are tested. This is where the efficiency gain comes from.\n\nHere‚Äôs one example: suppose you train a robot to pick up a box and place it somewhere. But every once in a while, the box is slightly misplaced and the robot arm has trouble gripping it. By enforcing physics into the simulation, the agent can learn how to correctly push this box in some way so that it returns in a state that the robot understands to continue its job. Now imagine these robots also have cameras and uses some computer vision algorithm to identify and sort boxes by appearance. If your simulation does not account for different materials (e.g. wood, plastic, metal), your robot will only be able to understand the types of box it has seen during its training. In other words, it won‚Äôt generalize well: give it a weird mirror-like box and your robot will entirely fail in real life. It may confuse the box for something else due to reflections unless it directly models how light interacts with surfaces using physics-based materials. \n\nOf course it takes time to model an entire BMW factory down to an inch, but if your end goal is a complete and robust automation of your production pipeline, this is your best bet. Photorealistic visualization is great, but it‚Äôs just eye candy and no one really cares in practice.\n\nSource: I‚Äôve interned at NVIDIA last year and also worked on Omniverse.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Wow very cool!

Will be tagging plays in JWM on Monday and the options look extremely playable given the 7% drop. With you here. \n\nCouple of Q‚Äôs\n\n1) DLTR faces a lot of completion from other dollar stores what makes them the right choice here especially given the run up? Make no mistake, I think equity here makes sense but am worried about potential options.\n\n2) AEO also has significant China exposure. Wouldn‚Äôt supply chain issues globally hamper them?\n\n3) AEO and ANF are pairs in my mind. What give you the comfort that both will rise? \n\nI think your above points are salient, just wanted more information here while scrolling through the options chain.", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "[removed]", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "You‚Äôre well researched and articulate.
