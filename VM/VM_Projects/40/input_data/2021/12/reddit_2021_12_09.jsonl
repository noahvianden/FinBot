Apologies if I've missed anything or for grammatical/spelling errors.\n\nTL;DR: If it were me, I'd ask if the premium worth the risk. \n\nThen, how likely do I think it is GME will hold these levels (whether short or long term). By selling puts you're, in a way, saying you're willing to own the shares if it doesn't go your way.\n\nAnd on the other side, how likely do you think it is that the MOASS (or relatively big movement) happens Friday? Because if you sell naked calls you're basically betting it will not.\n\n--\n\nLong Version: \n\nNow, I've only been doing options for 9 months, so apologies if I'm missing something, but I feel like your max risk selling puts is your strike x 100, minus the premium right? Safer than selling naked calls, where your max loss is technically unlimited, though a day trade would probably be less risky than say a naked call two weeks out imo.\n\nI guess with naked puts you're taking on the shares with margin (and not cash) so the interest has to be factored in?\n\nAnyway, I know these premiums will be lower by Friday, but using today's EOD numbers (closed at $173.65), say you sold the 155p and collected $550 premium. For whatever reason,  you can't get out, it closes ITM, you get assigned. That's $15500 for the shares minus the premium of $550 you collected. Your cost is $14950 (per put sold) and if GME went to zero you that's what you're gonna lose assuming you don't sell calls/buy puts around it after that. \n\nNow like someone already said, is that premium of $550 worth the risk of 14950? Most people would say no, but then what percentage do you assign to that scenario actually playing out (getting assigned and then it goes to zero)? Because to me getting assigned is fine if you actually want to own the stock. \n\nNow, I saw you mentioned selling naked calls on another comment. If you sold naked one-day calls, I mean yes your risk is technically unlimited, but you would only really be F'd in the A if Friday ends up being MOASS day.\n\nSure you may still lose a lot. Like say you sold the 185c for $7.25 and you don't/can't close it out. Even if it runs up to something like $250 after hours and that's what you can buy it for Monday. You are on the hook for $25000-725 which is $24,275. And then you subtract the $18500 you get back for selling the shares you're responsible for which is a loss of $5775 (I think. Someone correct me if I'm wrong). \n\nSo again, is a max win of $725 (sometimes you'll win less) x% of the time worth losing variable amounts of money the rest of the time? And within that, a very small percentage of the time you lose massive amounts of money.\n\nAll that said, I'm assuming if you're approved for level 5 and are considering naked options, you have the income to back it and stocks are more a game for you at this point... Or you just typed really big numbers on the options qualifier, in which case probably don't do naked options.\n\nI guess the question is, what is the probability of big movement (say 25% + either way) on Friday. What is the probability of GME going parabolic that day (🚀🚀🚀 %)? Are you willing to play those odds for the premium offered on a same day expiry?\n\nAgain sorry if there is some angle I'm not seeing, but either way GL to you OP.

The castings are highly functional, but appear to be slightly textured (non-shiny surface). Also, doors and other external body parts need multiple layers of metal to have full strength, so they couldn't be cast in one piece anyway, and it makes sense to cast as much as possible and then use a stamped sheet for the outermost layer.\n\nDoes that seem reasonable?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Why do they need layers?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "> Why do they need layers?\n\nLook at this picture [https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-01/inr0ht58_elon-musk-elon-musk-old-pic_625x300_12_January_21.jpg](https://c.ndtvimg.com/2021-01/inr0ht58_elon-musk-elon-musk-old-pic_625x300_12_January_21.jpg) of Elon Musk repairing a car door (photo taken by his mother). He is touching an inner sheet of metal, with holes in it for access to the interior and perhaps to save weight. There are side pieces, and an outer sheet of metal (not really visible in the photo) forming the exterior of the door, and no doubt painted the color of the car exterior. Fastened together, these pieces of metal form a rigid box structure, far stronger than a single sheet of metal would be. Additional strengthening structures can be put inside the box structure of the door.\n\nAccording to the source referenced on Twitter, Tesla is planning to die cast the doors using a Gigapress, and it's easy to see how the inside part of the door (comparable to the part Elon is touching in the photo) could be cast in one piece, and likely the side pieces and interior reinforcing structures could also be cast as part of that same piece. Tesla has demonstrated skill with multi-part dies so there could be protrusions or recesses if needed on the various sides of the piece.\n\nBut if you also try to cast the exterior surface of the door as part of the same one piece, then it becomes enormously difficult to design the part of the die that makes sure the door structure is hollow, because after the casting metal has hardened, that part of the die would have to come out the small holes in the interior face (see the hole that Elon put his hand into in the photo).\n\nTo take advantage of the efficiency of casting, it's far easier to cast all the door except one face as one piece, and then use a separate piece of metal for the remaining face. Doing it that way, the one remaining face might as well be the exterior side of the door. That final piece could also be cast, but as I described, there's no obvious advantage to casting it - might as well stamp it, as door exteriors are currently stamped, and it would likely have a smoother finish than a casting, useful because that's the part of the door that people mainly see.", "score": 4, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "It’s true that casting gives you a surface which is not smooth.

They provide structured ways to protect positions based on testable edges.\n\nFor examples I'll use the 2008 top in SPX and some examples from stocks that have boomed and popped through 2021. I'll also include some of these setups that I think are worth being aware of now.\n\n# A high percentage of the time a market top will come somewhere between a 161 and 220 extension of the last fall.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gt9qwd8ype481.png?width=1683&format=png&auto=webp&s=191d4c48bf0a0a4c0392a9596571ef60562e42bd\n\n \n\n**Pros of the signal:** It is astonishingly time-tested. You can drop into charts of 1915, 1920 and 1929 and find this signal in the DJI on all three of those crashes. It was present in the high of 2020 if you drew a fib from the high to low of the last drop in 2018 (An entirely non-subjective thing. There was only one high and one low. Only one way to draw that fib).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ta4ij64qe481.png?width=1919&format=png&auto=webp&s=182bef3ebcfaf8b75e151f66ddd9dbc37e0ec59f\n\nHere was a real time forecast on the DJI in Feb 2020 for a 10,000 point drop. My bearish sentiment in late 2019 and early 2020 was due to us heading into this danger zone (And I know there was news, but there always was. The 1915 top off a 161 came on the breakout of a war). This forecast was wrong in various ways, but the DJI did drop 10,000 points. Was worth hedging that move.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uisgl1c7qe481.png?width=1643&format=png&auto=webp&s=37e4bb399128b80fac063d5032dcefee42470fb4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gfsmcy39qe481.png?width=1643&format=png&auto=webp&s=c907de5e8c5c78e479e16c76e17b5096d95c69bc\n\n \n\nOther examples:\n\nPLTR\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iuu0ud2gqe481.png?width=1681&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0837ed0b07b40f92b5f7a3b45b0283fcd7d8301\n\n \n\nI'm sure some of you will remember me persistently saying it was great trade to short calls into PLTR rallies, buy OTM puts and target the break of 20. Said this for most of Feb and March (Stopped talking about PLTR after the break low to hit the target).\n\nTo show this spans over markets, here is doge. [Real time forecast on this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeatTheBear/comments/n4so4l/i_think_the_doge_high_is_being_made/) was made where I was saying I expected to see doge make a high and drop over 70%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w4mpn5nlqe481.png?width=1676&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c21730c3506b06700a491b4772e6b3c50a33a21\n\n**Today's example:**\n\nI've never seen one of these so big before.

SPX currently trades in the danger zone if we use the March 2020 drop for our fibs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#  In a dropping market, corrections will tend towards parabolic moves going 2/3 up of the last big fall. These are 76% fib retracements.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n This is the golden level in which\n\nh to hedge against a further decline in a market. Here's this retracement into the high of 2007. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dx7m3uj4re481.png?width=1673&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c36d6c64c41ccda5ec9d1816a66a2ab0bea493d\n\nThis signal would repeat various times through the 2007/2008 drop.  Using this strategy it would have been very easy to have hedged during Dec 2007 to Fed 2008, before things got messy. \n\nHere was the same in the PLTR high.  And it was 76 bounces all the way down. I posted all of these at the time as they appeared.

Most impulsive decisions are made when price moves fast and gets a bit over half way up the fall.  A lot of unnecessary big losses are made off 76% rejections in a bull trap. \n* Highly cost effective hedge. It pays out 1:5 - 1:8 RR. The win rate on it to cover losses it generates is very small and you do not end up losing a yrs gains in a week if the market drops. \n* It will save you in a crash. Really, really helps. It turns hopefulness in preparedness \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Cons of the signal:** \n\nSometimes comes off 61.8 fib. In these cases you miss a hedge or you enter early and increase area of tolerance / dilute RR. \n\nIt generates a lot of false signals. By necessity all new ATH's will at some point trade a 76% retrace. There are various ways to improve this but the RR tends to be profitable taking all signals, especially if you contain those to \"Danger areas\" in the macro. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Today's example:** \n\nThis signal might be forming in SPX now. A short entry has triggered but it's too early to see if this would be a stop out or a move into a new low. If there's a move into a new low, another hedging setup will often form after the spike low. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/re4ebs6ite481.png?width=1918&format=png&auto=webp&s=1840be4dd5e9ac3806c947c40800f7502db35c47\n\n======================\n\nNone of these signals are intended to be 100% win rate.

For a quick version here's the 161 / 76 low in March of 2020 [https://imgur.com/a/wCKAP1A](https://imgur.com/a/wCKAP1A)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure how many people are aware, and I think it's worth pointing it out to anyone who will listen, this confluence of TA signals (100 yrs in the making, nothing new) came in on SPX at the exact moment the fundies were worst (Lockdowns confirmed). If you watched TV, the March low was paradoxical - but it would have been well anticipated by anyone with a very simple retracement fib on their chart.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Real trade examples https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/rgk94v/some\\_76\\_fib\\_rejection\\_strategy\\_examples/", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "Can’t believe we crossed over 4700 on Spx today…  didn’t pay to get bearish today, sooo….
