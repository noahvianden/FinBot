I think that the bull market will last longer than the secular bear market that preceded it and the secular bear market lasted from 1999 to 2014, 15 full years.\n\nThat bear market also had the second worst recession since the Great Depression.\n\nIf history is any indicator in this macro scale and it usually is then secular bull and bear markets usually feed off the other in terms of longevity, in the case of 1949, the secular bull market formed after the Great Depression was in 1949 and lasted to 1966, 17 full years without any major corrections. Which matched the Great Depression which was about 20 years. Given that there was a lot of profit building after 1937, the Great Depression's bear market wasn't all bad.\n\nWe had one major correction, which probably extended life to this bull market by wiping out a lot of leveraged positions which had to essentially \"start over\".\n\nWe are only about 7 years into a bull market which means we have 10 more years to go if the previous recession gave it any longevity (which it has).\n\nFurthermore, the US is experiencing economic growth never before seen which will sustain the bull market in areas like:\n\n1. New-Space, the US is poised to capture some 90% of a new market expected to grow from $300 billion today to $3+ Trillion by 2030 and on to the moon after that. Literally - moon mining and asteroid mining are long term goals of NASA and the US. \n2. Electric Vehicles - US dominates the EV market and it's only going to explode from here. \n3. Deep Sea Mining - The US controls most of the valuable lithium, cobalt and nickel accessible on the sea floor - expect to see that industry explode in 5 to 10 years. None public yet.\n4. New-Computing - won't go so far as to call it \"quantum\" computing but the US is reeling in Semiconductors, new architecture and pushing into \"deep tech\". \n5. 3D Printing like never before seen. \n6. Blockchain - US isn't a leader in blockchain but it certainly got a huge boost from China's banning it. \n\nThese are the biggest growth sectors in the world and will only get bigger, and the US dominates most of them.\n\nSo if you think that the bull market is about to end, you got another thing coming.\n\nBecause of stupid subreddit rules I removed the tickers symbol list of some dozen tickers I put down.
