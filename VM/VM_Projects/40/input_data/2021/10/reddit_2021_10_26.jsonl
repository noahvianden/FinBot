To me this is a smaller hill than most make it out to be. I mean I work in manufacturing and the limiting factor to the speed of development is money it always has been and always will be…for this reason I see the pain being short lived and a faster ROI then the Wendy’s cashiers on Reddit believe it will be..and they have the massive advantage of being a US based company where the majority of the fab demand originates from.
