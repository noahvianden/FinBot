I only say that because there does seem to be some confusion about semis. \n\nTSM reported earnings the other day with a huge beat, which analysts did not expect. The only reason the price dropped in the greater semiconductor segment is because of general economic outlook, related to employment and transport. And I don't think either of these is going to effect semiconductors. Most people will gladly work in semi industry because it's a generally a well paying sector and not some Nike sweatshop. And semis were already traveling by air as the pandemic started because the margins allow it. And you have to remember that the whole shortages fud was prevalent then too, and we know how that worked out, semis performed exceptionally well, because of unprecedented demand that will continue into the holiday season, which marks the greatest consumer demand for electronics. \n\nSpeaking of demand, does anyone expect demand to subside in the near future? I don't. Outside of elevated consumer demand for staple semiconductor products, I think the industry will change and will continue to serve more sectors. Every company today is trying to be a tech company and semis play a big role in that.\n\nIntel broke ground on 2 fabs in Arizona, and as the result it's about time when these tooling manufacturers start upgrading their guidance with that in mind. TSM is committing 100 billion dollars worth of it's own expansion. These are strong catalysts for the industry. \n\nTickers I'm talking about LRCX and AMAT, there are also smaller players.
