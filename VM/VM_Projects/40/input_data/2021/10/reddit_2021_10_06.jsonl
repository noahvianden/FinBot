{"title": "Hedge Funds Scramble To Buy Crude Oil Futures As Market Tightens", "selftext": "**Key Take-Aways**\n\n* Hedge fund speculators are having a heyday in oil markets, betting big on even higher crude prices in the short-to-medium term.¬†\n* Demand for oil is set to continue rising in the months to come.\n* Supply, meanwhile, remains constrained, and it‚Äôs not just OPEC+‚Äôs fault\n\nEarlier this year, oil began to fall out of favor with traders as the focus on energy attention increasingly shifted towards renewable power and the energy transition. But then last month, an energy crunch squeezed Europe. It then spread to China and India, and now there are warnings that it may make its way to the U.S.¬† And the price of oil has gone flying.\n\n## Speculators Rush into Oil as Energy Crunch Worsens\n\nReuters‚Äô John Kemp [reported](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/hedge-funds-flock-oil-energy-shortages-worsen-kemp-2021-10-04/?rpc=401&) in his latest weekly column on hedge fund oil buying that large oil speculators had purchased the equivalent of 42 million barrels across the most traded oil and fuel contracts last week, bringing the total for the last six weeks to 170 million barrels. This, Kemp noted, reversed more than half of net sales totaling 268 million barrels accumulated over the previous ten weeks.\n\nThe buying is set to continue this week, too unless speculators decide to take profits, after yesterday OPEC+ [decided](https://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-russias-gradual-oil-hike-pushes-prices-to-seven-year-high-11633356803) to not add more barrels to its monthly production boost of 400,000 bpd despite calls to do so from the IEA and Washington. There had been reports OPEC+ might add 800,000 bpd in November and no barrels in December, but the group eventually decided to keep the rate of additions unchanged.\n\n[**Related: WTI Crude Oil Price Hits 7-Year High**](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/WTI-Crude-Oil-Price-Hits-7-Year-High.html)\n\nAs a result, [Brent crude](https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/) ended trade on Monday at over $81 per barrel, with [West Texas Intermediate](https://oilprice.com/oil-price-charts/) at close to $78 per barrel. At the time of writing, both were still higher after dipping slightly following the first reaction of the market to the OPEC+ announcement.\n\nDemand for oil is set to continue rising in the months to come, not only because of the continuing global economic recovery but because of the energy crunch that has sent natural gas prices so high it is now cheaper for some utilities to switch to oil derivatives from gas to generate electricity. According to Aramco, this crunch could see additional oil demand of half a million barrels daily.\n\nSupply, meanwhile, remains constrained, and it‚Äôs not just OPEC+‚Äôs fault. U.S. oil producers have shown remarkable restraint amid recovering oil prices as they prioritized shareholder returns over production growth. And this priority will remain, according to the chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources.\n\n‚ÄúEverybody‚Äôs going to be disciplined, regardless whether it‚Äôs $75 Brent, $80 Brent, or $100 Brent,‚Äù Scott Sheffield [told](https://www.ft.com/content/c21eb656-8d09-45ce-a13a-7d8419426b05?desktop=true&segmentId=7c8f09b9-9b61-4fbb-9430-9208a9e233c8#myft:notification:daily-email:content) the Financial Times. ‚ÄúAll the shareholders that I‚Äôve talked to said that if anybody goes back to growth, they will punish those companies.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think the world can rely much on US shale,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really under Opec control,‚Äù he added.\n\nNo wonder, then, that short positions on oil have fallen to the lowest since late 2019, Reuters‚Äô Kemp reported, while new bearish positions added 41 million barrels of oil equivalent over last week. This may continue this week, too, as there are precious few bearish factors at play for oil right now.\n\n[**Related: The Real Reason OPEC+ Refused To Boost Production Further**](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Natural-Gas/The-Real-Reason-OPEC-Refused-To-Boost-Production-Further.html)\n\nIt‚Äôs true that Britain‚Äôs PM has [declared](https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/boris-johnson-energy-renewable-clean-b1931797.html) that all electricity in the country would be generated from clean energy sources by 2035 and that the European Parliament has [urged](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/2254544-eu-parliament-touts-russia-oil-gas-import-phaseout) the Commission to reduce the EU‚Äôs dependence on Russian gas, but for now, these are both in the realm of wishful thinking rather than reality.\n\n## Short-Term Outlook For Oil Prices Remains Bullish\n\nIn other words, the short-term outlook for oil prices is rather bullish. A nuclear deal between the U.S. and Iran could limit the upward potential for oil, but that deal is still far from certain as the two sides have yet to meet again for another round of negotiations.\n\nA change of priorities in U.S. shale would also have a bearish effect on prices but based on what Pioneer‚Äôs CEO told the FT, this is unlikely to happen, at least among the public companies in the field. Smaller, private independents could boost production to take advantage of the price trend but just how fast this would affect global prices remains to be seen.\n\nBy Irina Slav for [Oilprice.com](https://Oilprice.com)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n**Opinion:** I keep hearing rumblings of: \"this is just another fake energy crisis\", \"Oil is going to plummet once OPEC cranks up production.\", \"The Biden administration hates oil, so everyone is going to be driving electric vehicles by \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (insert magical date here) and oil demand will vanish\".  **If you're in that camp, by all means, please sit on the sidelines while I and others invest in oil and gas companies who are positioned to straight-up pillage their way through what will surely be a** long and painful transition to \"green\"/renewable energy.  Just to be clear, when I say pillage, I mean that certain Oil & Gas companies are literally going to be hemorrhaging free cash flow and giving that cash back to investors via **huge share buy-backs** and increased dividends.\n\n**For the rest of us, there is serious money to be made in Oil & Gas Stocks**\n\nAs stated in the article above, the fact that Hedge Funds are furiously buying up Oil Contracts is a clear sign that the \"smart money\" see's that the tables have officially turned and they are going to get in on the fun.\n\n# So what's the play?\n\nFor anyone who has read any of my previous posts, it's no secret that I'm a huge fan of MRO, who is set up perfectly to boom in the times of elevated Oil and Gas Prices.  **And for those out there who say that I'm being redundant,** **MRO is up over 30% since I began posting on MRO (and Oil/Gas in general) about a month ago.  I personally think that the run is just getting started and I will continue to post news and fact-based analysis that support this thesis.**\n\n**For a run down on why I think MRO is the best play, please see these two posts:**\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q22m4a/marathon\\_oil\\_stock\\_mro\\_it\\_just\\_keeps\\_getting/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q22m4a/marathon_oil_stock_mro_it_just_keeps_getting/)\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q18fg5/opec\\_opts\\_against\\_big\\_output\\_boost\\_pushing\\_oil/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/q18fg5/opec_opts_against_big_output_boost_pushing_oil/)\n\n# MRO - GO BABY GO\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Nic Cage is HAMMERING the Nitrous Button on the MRO Shelby Cobra](https://i.redd.it/6qx973zjb1s71.gif)\n\n**Position:**\n\n* **\\*I am long on MRO in a straight share purchase** given that there will be volatility in the market over the next few months and the exact timing is difficult to predict.

There is also the x-factor of OPEC+ who has shown historic solidarity in controlling the price of oil, they simply won't let oil fall below $60/barrel ever again.
