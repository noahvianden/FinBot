{"title": "Why is simple Dollar Cost Averaging still the king of all investment strategies? - Analyzing the last 3 decades of stock market data to find the best DCA strategy", "selftext": "By now we have all heard the virtues of Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and that you should never try to time the market. Basically, it has been repeated ad nauseam that\n\n>Time in the market beats timing the market\n\nBut what is interesting is that I could not find any research that has been done on the best way to do dollar-cost averaging.\n\n**Theoretically, there must be a better way than to randomly throw your hard-earned money once a month into SPY, right?**\n\nSo in this week’s analysis, we will explore various methods to do DCA and see which one would end up giving you the best returns!\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/7o5yzn32g0t71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=1da0fd7b17c70da287b8aedada407866f10d5cfe)\n\n**Analysis**\n\nGiven that dollar-cost averaging is about holding investments long-term, we need data, lots and lots of data! For this, I have pulled the adjusted daily closing price & Shiller P/E ratio of SPY for the last 30 years \\[1\\].\n\nNow we have to devise different methods to do the Dollar-cost averaging that will maximize our long-term return. We will have different personas for reflecting different investment styles (all of them would be investing the same amount - $100 every month but following different strategies)\n\n**Average Joe:** Invests on the first of every month no matter how the market is trending (this would be our benchmark)\n\n**Cautious Charlie:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio \\[2\\] is lesser than the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold Treasury-Bills \\[3\\]\n\n**Balanced Barry:** Invests in the market only if the Price to Earnings Ratio is within +20% \\[4\\] of the last 5-year rolling average, else will hold T-Bills\n\n**Analyst Alan:** Invests whenever the market pulls back a certain percentage from the last all-time high, else will hold T-Bills \\[5\\].\n\nGiven that we need to have some historical data before we start our first investment, I have considered the starting point to be 1st Jan 1994. So the analysis is based on someone who invested $100 every month since 1994. In all the above strategies, we will only hold treasury bills till the investment requirements are satisfied. I.e, in the case of Cautious Charlie, he will keep on accumulating T-Bills every month if the PE ratio is not within his set limit. Once it’s below the limit, he will convert all the T-bills and invest them into SPY.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/hqtpv142g0t71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ac9e7108abfd232e8f16538acbf3ec0c4c3e202)\n\n**Results**\n\nBased on the time period of our analysis, we would have invested a total amount of $33,400 till now.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/8izqmjk4g0t71.png?width=798&format=png&auto=webp&s=b66dd9df7a2e9f0a393f237cd937ce9705a517b3)\n\nNo matter what strategy we use, the most amount of returns were made by the Average Joe who invested every month no matter how the market was trending. A close second was Analyst Alan who accumulated money in T-Bills and only invested when the market dropped more than 1% from its all-time high.\n\nThe least amount of returns were generated by Cautious Charlie who only invested if the PE ratio was lesser than the last 5-year average (basically by trying to avoid over-valued rallies, he ended up missing on all the gains), followed by the Analyst Alan persona who waited for a 10% drop from ATH before investing.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/nsccfy42g0t71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=4dea99f13746130a25515daa2aed68b655bfb6b7)\n\n**Limitations**\n\nThere are some limitations to the analysis.\n\na. Tax on the gain on sale of treasury bills and transactions costs are not considered in the analysis. Both of these would adversely affect the overall returns\n\nb. Since I am only using the monthly data for the P/E ratio and my SPY investments (due to data constraints), a much more complicated strategy involving intra-month price changes might have a better chance of beating the market (at the same time making it more difficult to execute).\n\nc. While we have analyzed the trends using the last 30 years’ worth of SPY data, the overall outcome might be different if we change the time period to say 40, 50, or even 100 years.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/cwve8u52g0t71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=11e1a91d5d7bca97532c920e425e0a873bef7f3c)\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI started off the analysis thinking that it would be pretty straightforward to find a winning strategy given that we are using nuanced strategies instead of randomly putting money in every month. I also checked for various time frames \\[5,10, 20 years\\] and various endpoints \\[Just before the covid crash, after the crash, before J-Pow, etc.\\]. In none of the cases did any of the strategies beat average Joe in the total returns.\n\nSince this is an optimization problem, I am [sharing all the data and my analysis](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JK4b-CYgvlSH-FqYvCBEve0RQ3ACmJNsmTwzLV7jqWs/edit?usp=sharing) in the hope that someone can tweak the strategy to finally give us that elusive risk-adjusted market-beating returns.\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/upvu7p57g0t71.png?width=626&format=png&auto=webp&s=8628e331535d269701036c5fe6b1b8f1bf7aec57)\n\nTill we find our King Arthur, all of us average Joes can rest easy knowing that there is no simple trick that can give you a better return than a vanilla DCA strategy.\n\nUntil next week….\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ub572272g0t71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea0c920629fe6b03670833561f4e7c48c1bb0ebf)\n\n**Footnotes**\n\n\\[1\\] The data was obtained from Yahoo Finance API and longtermtrends.net. While the P/E ratio was available for the last 130+ years, the daily closing of SPY was limited to 30 years.\n\n\\[2\\] We are using the Shiller PE ratio - this ratio divides the price of the S&P 500 index by the average inflation-adjusted earnings of the previous 10 years. This solves for the brief period in 2009 when the normal PE ratio went through the roof as the earnings of the companies fell drastically due to the financial crisis.\n\n\\[3\\] We are holding treasury bills as it has the shortest maturity dates and does not have a minimum holding period unlike the T-Bonds\n\n\\[4\\] The 20% cut-off is considered as it would be above one standard deviation from the historical trends\n\n\\[5\\] The idea of investing after the market pullbacks is driven by the following report from JP Morgan which stated that 70% of the best days in the market happened within 14 days of the worst ones\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/tq0655bag0t71.png?width=507&format=png&auto=webp&s=218ce202213b86b88fed658e9656a76ec7c907e6)", "id": "q6kqvs", "created_utc": 1634040676.0, "score": 346, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 48, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for sharing, it's always good to see exactly what kind of difference these different strategies actually make with some examples like this.

I actually think you can potentially do a lot better though, especially in the current market.  I think that something like an average of 0.7%-1% per week is doable although maybe not strictly with just running the wheel, so 30%-50% per year in returns.  The problem is that it only takes a few significant losses to wipe your gains, so the real trick to trading is the second rule of trading which is \"don't lose money\" (or \"don't not make money\" depending on who you ask).  It's pretty easy to make money selling options because you literally do it up front when you collect the premium.  The rest of the time you're just trying to make sure you don't lose the premium that you've collected.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo do this you really need to understand position sizing and risk management so that you don't trade too large and have a single loss wipe out multiple months of gains.  The temptation is to scale up your trades by trading more contracts or trading more expensive stocks and that's really not always the best thing to do since by doing so you're taking on more risk or at least more concentrated risk.  If I trade 1 contract of BA and 1 contract of TSLA, then if one of those trades goes against me I can still make up for that loss in the other and it's probably not going to be the case that those two companies move together since they aren't correlated.  If I trade 2x contracts of just TSLA or just BA then I have all the risk concentrated in that single position, or conversely if I trade 1x MSFT and 1x AAPL then I'm concentrated in tech so if tech takes a dive then that could be a problem.  You don't need to over-diversify and you can always just trade SPY to avoid some of that risk, but the point is that you shouldn't just go 2 or 3 contracts just because you can afford to.  You should try to diversify, trade wider spreads, etc. before scaling up your trade sizes.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is something that I'm currently struggling with but so far I've been disciplined about it and as a result, the two or three losing trades that I've had in the last few months haven't really significantly impacted my profits.  My most recent loss was on F last week when my CC went ITM with only a few days left on it so I had to close it for a loss.  Fortunately F kept running so my profit on the underlying offset most of that loss and the put side of my strangle offset the remainder, but if I'd bought 200 more shares like I'd thought about doing, it would have tripled the size of my loss since I would have sold 3 CCs against F instead of 1 (technically 1 strangle and 2 CCs with how I trade but whatever).  Instead of buying those shares, I decided to use the rest of my capital to open a nice 100/85 PCS on AMD, which at 50% profit made me almost double the amount of money that I lost on that single CC on F.  Much better choice than increasing the number of contracts on a single position in my opinion.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, I think minimizing risk by diversifying is key to not falling on your face.

You'll probably quickly realize why most people here don't really use the wheel and graduate to spreads and strangles though.
