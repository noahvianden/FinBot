I think Tesla sets a great real world example of loving the company/Elon's eccentrics/EVs/etc but also not a great stock. While admittedly I did ride up $TSLA pre-S&P 500, that was before the P/E was grossly overvalued. Now I am not one of those that invest solely on fundamentals but also on sentiment, momentum and things I personally like. One thing to be said about $TSLA, or at least a lot of companies in general that are considered fairly nascent high growth is that typically you start over pricing growth. Most that start having a large rise, even paired with large profit margins/RoE/RoA/RoC you will see that over time they tend to rubber-band back towards a more value projection. This is mainly either due to competition or market sentiment or mistakes along the way or generally just a large fall in the market. Look at $CSCO or $ORCL near early 2000's \"bubble\". Now we are somewhat in a massive tech growth bubble. I wouldn't say that they were skyhigh because of the bubble as most of those bad companies didn't have actual revenue. One way to compare $TSLA to those 2x is the massive growth then sell off. What if I told you that Cisco and Oracle had massive revenue growth leading up to 1999. You would say, even at the top you would say it would of course continue going up. Well, what if I told you that it crashed and then it took 15yrs to go back up, all while STILL beating revenue consistently.\n\nWhat I am getting to is that, while Tesla as a company will continue to beat revenue and grow, the same people that support it will also start supporting other companies. People LOVE variety of vehicles. Yes, Tesla from an EV standpoint is on top. US built, safety standards, the current Beta Auto-drive system BUT, there are a multitude of companies around the globe that are working on the same thing. Are they a few years behind, sure. Are they currently going through the same QC issues that Tesla has had over the years and mostly worked through, sure. Look at GM's batteries, Ford Mach-E QC issues, the recalls and etc. The problem is that it is so overpriced right now that people are paying almost 500x for the stock compared to what the revenue is. Almost 350x the price compared to what their actual free cash flow is. To top it off, if Tesla was an amazing stock, then why is it that they continue to dilute the shares consistently every single quarter? That is just crapping all over your investors. Does dilution of shares help them use some of that cash to expand, sure. The problem is the amount of shares they keep dumping into circulation with not a single word on share buy back in the future. \n\nWhat happens when you get to 5 yrs and there are 50 other car companies that all have competing vehicles? Sure, they can continue their growth I can imagine but it'll probably slow with a lot of global competition. If they were the best as much as people are paying for the stock then why don't they currently have 90+% of the global EV market. It's because people like variety. So, say it's a value stock today compared to 5yrs from now. Okay, now you are just justifying paying for a growth stock that's only worth $1000/share with revenue and profit margins in 5yrs from now. To justify the stock price currently you have to make a TON of If/True statements; revenue continues to blow out estimates, global growth continues to blow out estimates, profit margin/RoE/RoA/RoC continue to blow out estimates, 3 party adaptors of his IP AI-Autodrive system, have multiple companies use Tesla's exclusively for EV taxis/car rentals, have Elon not mess up on Twitter and say something wrong or have a fallout with market sentiment because of something offensive. Over 5yrs a LOT of things can change. While I do agree that high growth companies can be afforded a lot more lenience in the P/E and other growth fundamentals on the balance sheet, it's really hard to swallow that this will continue going up. I think short term trading would be a little better but once quantitative easing starts being pulled back next month over the next 6-8 months and potential rate raises next year or 2023, I can imagine this may sideways trade for a long time until it normalizes with a P/E <100 in the least.", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}, {"body": "!Remindme 5 years", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 5 years on [**2026-10-25 22:30:16 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2026-10-25%2022:30:16%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/qfl27w/daddy_elon_and_tesla_hardcarrying_the_automotive/hi1jzu4/?context=3)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FStockMarket%2Fcomments%2Fqfl27w%2Fdaddy_elon_and_tesla_hardcarrying_the_automotive%2Fhi1jzu4%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202026-10-25%2022%3A30%3A16%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20qfl27w)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "right here. fuck elon musk.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Keep crying about it boomer ü§£", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "thanks! keep sucking his dick", "score": -2, "replies": [{"body": "Warren buffet dick too wrinkly for you?", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "not enough apartheid emeralds", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "Lol down voting you as they practice deep throating bananas.", "score": -1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Because he literally has power people with power say one thing and the market will spike up only people who are high up their in the pyramid scheme gets the say", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}
