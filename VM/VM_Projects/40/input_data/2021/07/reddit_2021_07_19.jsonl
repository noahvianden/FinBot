{"title": "A bear market hypothesis from a bull, COVID 4th wave is here", "selftext": "I have been investing for the better part of 10 years now and into swing trading for the last 3 years. I have been a bull almost my entire time investing, with the exception of a few of the black swan events we have had.  I feel that I have a pretty high risk tolerance and typically do not even hedge my long positions. However, my hypothesis is that we will soon see a steep stock market correction. To be fair my hypothesis is pretty narrow and does not account for the countless factors that drive the market. My hypothesis is that we are early in the 4th wave of COVID.  I am a physician assistant and I work in an urgent care and two ERs in Louisiana.  I can tell you that all of my colleagues and I have been seeing a marked increase in COVID cases in the last 3-4 weeks. Even more so last week.  I can tell you hospitals in my are near capacity and almost all are on hospital wide diversion (meaning they aren't accepting noncritical transfers). Looking at the national and Louisiana new case rate you can see small uptrend in cases in the last few weeks, but keep in mind this data is delayed. It does not account for the most recently cases ( I believe it is delayed by a week or two). I believe that this is the beginning of the 4th wave and soon we will see numbers like we did back in November-February.  Counter point obviously is vaccination. Unfortunately, Louisiana does have some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, at around 39%. Nationally the vaccination rate is around 48% fully vaccinated. I spend so much of my time trying to educate, but it seems that most of the people that wanted to get vaccinated already have. I don't see a drastic uptick in vaccination rates especially in southern states where conspiracy theories run rampant.  I ask every single patient that I diagnose with covid if they have been vaccinated and I can tell you about 8-10% of my patients are vaccinated. The vaccine obviously provides protection, but I fear that at under 50% is not high enough. Additionally, covid fatigue is a real thing. I know most people are tired of hearing about it. Our guard is down. I am not sure how it is in the rest of the country but, in my state everything is pretty much 100% open and back to normal. No one wears masks in public anymore and I do not see that changing unless a masks again become required to enter businesses (as of now they are not my area).  People are back to gathering in large groups.  I believe this is the prefect situation for us to see a rapid increase in new case rates leading to the 4th wave. Now here is where it gets more complex. Once we are in the fully into our 4th spike what will happen? Do we have massive lockdowns again, restaurants, bars, schools etc closed. If so I think so we will see another big dip in the market. Or do they simply recommended masks use in public places. If this happens I'd imagine we still have  a dip from covid case spiking fears, but not as much as if we are locked down again.  I do realize my hypothesis uses a lot of information from my first hand accounts and may seem to others to be short sighted. That is why I would like to hear form you and see your feelings on the upcoming 3,6,12 months.  As for me, I am bearish at least in the short term. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisclosure: I hold only long positions at this time.

I’ve spent a while trying to understand how it works and how its options work - it’s a massive confusing rabbit hole. Some relevant tl;dr pieces are:\n\n* The way it’s calculated is using a complicated formula of put/call ratios on SPX. You don’t really need to know how that math works, but more of what the overall sentiment means\n* It doesn’t really track SPY in the way you’d think - just because VIX is going up doesn’t mean SPY will go down, or vice versa\n* There’s no actual underlying (you can’t buy VIX shares), so the options are all cash settled. This also means there’s no real way to arbitrage it in the ways since bots are constantly forcing the option prices to pretty much perfectly track the difference between the spot price and the futures price\n* The different dated options track the different futures (which are tracking expected volatility for a month out from their date), so they don’t necessarily correlate with each other. E.g. the options for July 21 track the corresponding future, which tries to predict volatility in August. A huge spike in VIX now probably won’t cause a huge spike in December calls, so you can’t use LEAPs the same way\n* It’s worth understanding what contango and backwardation mean (essentially they’re the price curve for VIX options against dates)\n\nOverall the main thing to keep in mind is the reversion to the mean theory: it generally hovers around a certain level (roughly 16 these days), spikes occasionally but hard, and then comes back down just as quickly unless there’s an actual market crash. In my limited experience so far, the way to play it is one of a few ways:\n\n* Buy some calls when it’s *very* low (I aim for sub-16 these days)\n   * This is my least preferred method. Most of the time you'll just lose a bunch of money to theta/delta\n* (Preferred) Sell low-ish strike (16-20) puts\n   * There’s no risk of early assignment since it’s European style / cash-settled so you can just wait it out if nothing is happening\n* Buy puts during a spike. Buying them beforehand will do basically nothing\n\nCheck this out for a lot more in-depth explanations: [https://www.macroption.com/vix/](https://www.macroption.com/vix/)", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Is it possible for the VIX to go negative?\n\nWhat percentage of your portfolio do you use to buy puts and calls of the VIX?\n\nDo you think someday in the future, when GAI bots totally run the market that the VIX will just stay be super low for a long time?", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Thanks for your input! in your experience, what is the most suitable timeframe to sell puts and leverage spikes?
