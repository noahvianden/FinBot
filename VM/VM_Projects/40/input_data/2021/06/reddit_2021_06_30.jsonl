I posted this answer a couple of days ago, but I think it applies to help you here: \n\nIV is created by bidders inflating the option beyond it's fair value. In an options pricing model like BSM or Stensland, the option has a fair value according to underlying's price, DTE, strike price, and the risk free interest rate (there are also differences in the calculation of early exercise, but don't focus on that). The remainder of the option's price then is IV. As an underlying's price moves in a direction or is anticipated to move in a direction, bidders suddenly appear at particular strikes, causing the price to move upward. Usually this correlates to an event like earnings, unexpected news, or in this case the underlying doubling... \"IV Crush\" then is experienced when the bidders suddenly disappear from that option, thereby causing the IV portion of the price to collapse, coming back closer to fair value. **IV is the reason then that an options price can seem to be non-sensical in such that a put can gain value when the underlying goes up, or a call gaining value when the price moves down, going against the normal pricing expectation.** Traders can capitalize on this IV inflation by actually selling the volatility in the option, and then as the IV disappears, they can buy back the option for a profit.\r  \n\r  \nHope that helps the understanding.", "score": 21, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you!
