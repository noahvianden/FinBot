The idea has been tossed around out there for years (starting with Hilary's campaign). Also, advocated by Susan Wachter who was cited as a potential replacement as the FHFA director earlier this year. It's an intriguing idea because you would basically get the best of both worlds, government would be able to maintain a high level of control and regulations on the GSEs. The downside of the current model, if a housing collapse were to replicate itself, taxpayers would get hurt with the burden of it. An infusion of private capital would basically give a layer of protection as they would lose their money first in that scenario, allow the GSEs to be more dynamic, and actually could promote the current administration core objective of affordable housing. The idea of full privatization is likely gone and honestly probably pretty dangerous, but a utility model could allow the government to maintain strict control, allow for an infusion of private capital, and maybe even give current shareholders the win they are desperately looking for (my guess is in this scenario legacy shares would be either built into the capital structure or settled).\n\nI'm not saying the GSEs are a buy, there is still massive risk here with a downside of $0.

Also, I have bought 250 shares pre-ipo due to using app and having a fidelity account, special pre-ipo they offered healthcare workers. \n\nToday is the IPO of Doximity. It is an app (saas) that is a mix between telehealth and a social media platform for doctors, nurse practitioners, PAs, dentists, etc. They are one of a kind in that they’re the only ones with this scope in the industry having the social media platform plus telehealth all in one. 80% (me included) of all doctors in the US use doximity. They also allow you to find jobs in your field and keep you up to date on the latest research. It is going to debut for 26$ and boy is that a deal. \n\nThis business has a market cap around 4 bil and is the market leader in an industry (telehealth, social media for professionals) that is about to drip like the oil boom. According to their S1, this industry is worth ~18 bil and is growing rapidly. That is telehealth. That does not include all the other aspects of this business. Last year alone over 63 million telehealth visits occurred. There are so many implications for this service (seeing patients unable to make it to clinic, counseling, etc). This is just the tip of the ice berg. With the money from the ipo they plan to grow rapidly and may incorporate an electronic medical records with this service eventually, which is fucking huge. It would make my life so much easier lol. \n\nWithin the last year revenue grew 78% from 116.4 mil to 206 mil. They also are already positive with earnings. Their biggest competitor, tdoc, (look at what they ipo at and now) are not profitable. This company is about to fucking boom don’t miss out.
