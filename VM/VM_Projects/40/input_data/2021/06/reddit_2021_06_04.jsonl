This has lead to 70% of sales not being from searches but from the menu.\n\nThey use a discovery based menu which is very attractive and also focus on personalized browsing just like tik tok does deep learning at its finest.\n\nThey collect data from more than 100 million users every month to personalize the menu even more giving them a very unique advantage. Using data is the key to success here because they use data to get better and more effective ads to maximiaze returns and conversion .\n\nGrowth\n\nThey grew revenue from $1.1 billion in 2017 to $1.9 billion in 2019 at a compound annual growth rate of 31% and from $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, an increase of 32% revenue is diversified and global. In 2019, 93% of our revenue was from marketplace services, 84% of which was from core marketplace revenue and 16% of which was from our native advertising tool, ProductBoost, and 7% was from logistics services.\n\nThey refer to marketplace revenue, excluding revenue from ProductBoost, as core marketplace revenue. ProductBoost is an advertising feature by which our merchants can promote their listings within user feeds.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 82% of revenue was from marketplace services, 90% of which was from core marketplace revenue and 10% of which was from ProductBoost, and 18% was from logistics services.\n\nIn terms of geographic diversification by users, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, 43% of core marketplace revenue came from Europe, 42% from North America, 5% from South America, and 10% from the rest of the world growth has been highly capital efficient.\n\nThey have been able to achieve this massive growth and scale by having net cumulative cash flow from operations of $16 million from January 1, 2017 to September 30, 2020, aided by their positive cash float, where they receive an upfront payment from a user, and remit payment to a merchant a number of weeks later.\n\nMerchants\n\nThey are basically the middle man that connects millions of costumers with merchants. They also provide them with value data to help them do more sales and expand even more. Analytics and data is a key part of their business and it should not be ignored\n\nWhat's is not so great about them\n\nThey grew to fast and have some problems with logistics\n\nThere have been some serious delays and even packages missing.

Their competitor $DKS Dicks Sporting Goods killed it this quarter but $ASO barely went up by proxy, comparatively.\n\n2. Retail is killing it this season, if you look at $DDS, $M, $TGT. This is especially true with inflation on the run.\n\n3. I believe $ASO has a secret weapon (literally) that will result in them blowing expectations out the water: Guns - all the competitors have been soft in this space due to recent events. As a (law abiding) gun owner, my friends and I all shop at $ASO. We have all noticed their stock have been consistently selling out. Cabelas and Bass Pro also have hunting stuff but there is 1 store per every $ASO \n\n4. $DKS has a P/E ratio that has been steadily decreasing due to their increasing stock price. Ratio went from 12 to 9 (after ER), $ASO currently has a P/E ratio of 10 but I think once they beat earnings it will be adjusted as such.

{"title": "[] Biomethane / Renewable Natural Gas: why it deserves as much attention as HYDROGEN & BATTERIES....and Wall-Street brokers and Investments Banks are not paying enough attention (yet)", "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nHere a top-down policy and regulatory analysis on the reasons why Renewable Natural Gas (in Europe we call it biomethane) makes sense for the transport sector. Still, the sector has not yet received the attention it deserves from major Investment Banks and Wall-Streets brokers (while hydrogen companies and batteries are covered by everyone).\n\n$CLNE is covered only by Credit Suisse but further brokers may come in the next months.\n\nthese are the bullet points to take into consideration for Natural Gas Vehicles trends:\n\n* **GHG BALANCE**: In order to get it you need to collect methane that would have alternatively leaked into the atmosphere, thus you immensely decrease the GHG emission balance of your activity as methane has a 30x worse effect than CO2). This is why according to the Low Carbon fuel standard system RNG has a negative carbon intensity. if you burn what you collected you will always have a minor impact on the environment in terms of GHG emissions. This is also why in some organizations and states natural gas vehicles fueled with RNG will be considered like ZERO EMISSION Vehicles despite the tailpipe emission of their combustion engines (as a reminder a natural gas combustion engine, compared to a diesel one, emits; 99% less **SOx** , 80% less **NOx,** 95% less **PM2.5 (Particulate)**, 20% less **CO2 (with a negative balance if Renewable Natural gas is used, see links below):**\n\n1.

Democrats and republicans both need farmer votes to win at state and federal level, and very often measures to help and support farmers are bipartisan in the House (trump trade war tariffs being an exception). Meat production is an energy intensive operations and farmers risk to be hit by heavy CO2 or GHG emissions taxes, thus RNG solve this issue for them:\n\n1.

[\"Too many cows according to Greenpeace\"](https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/greenpeace-calls-tighter-regulations-push-dairy-sector-climate-targets-just-too-many-cows)\n\n* **Fuel Price**: what made CLNE  succeed in their early golden age was nothing related to the environment. Nobody cared about it in 2010-2015. Natural gas price was favorable if compared with diesel and the companies were able to raise capital substantially. What went wrong? the spread differential became not favorable and the companies entered in a spiral of negative events (and mismanagement). Today natural gas is still cheaper and thanks to incentives RNG can be blended with fossil one. Thus, if you buy a natural gas truck you enjoy a lower fuel price.\n\n1. [\"Fuel costs savings with natural gas\"](https://www.fortisbc.com/est/mining-trucks/fuel-cost-savings-with-natural-gas)\n\n* **Fleet operators business model**: truck drivers margins are attacked from any side. Increasing labor costs, expensive diesel price, increasing environmental regulatory burden all make the business harder. and what some green extremists wants? they want truck drivers to buy expensive, not yet market ready, battery electric trucks, whose charging time and range capabilities are still suboptimal. Not mentioning what can happen to , let's say, the LA harbor, if all the 16000 trucks switch to electric versions. How can you find the grid to power them in that single place, and more specifically, in California?\n\n1.

With a preferential flow into the transport sector it can be able to satisfy more than 40% of natural gas transport demand. In California in 2020 it satisfied 90% of NG trucks demand; in Germany 50% of the gas used in transport is renewable (Europe as a whole is 20%)\n\n1. [\"RNG untapped potential\"](https://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2020/05/04/rngs-untapped-potential/)\n2. [\"biomethane potential accross the world\"](https://energypost.eu/biogas-and-biomethanes-untapped-potential-across-the-world/)\n\nBut how many natural gas vehicles there can be on the road? For this it is a good idea to look at China, which has a tremendous problem with urban emissions. IN 2015 Government there decided that LNG trucks had to gain market share in order to improve air quality. In 2020, LNG trucks were responsible for 10% of all Heavy Duty Trucks sales in the country (source: [http://www.chinatrucks.com/statistics/2020/1229/article\\_9522.html](http://www.chinatrucks.com/statistics/2020/1229/article_9522.html)). In Europe the same measure is equal to 4% of all sales, while in the US it should be like 2%.\n\nTherefore, if natural gas trucks are going to rise in sales in the US too (see Cummins last cc for this info) it is natural to understand why the potential of CLNE is so high. Then it is obvious the reason of the investment of Amazon in the company.
