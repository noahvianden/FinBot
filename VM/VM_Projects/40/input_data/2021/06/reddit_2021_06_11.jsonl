I'm really fucking sick and tired of listening to CNBC and the same response comes out \"These Wall Street Bets kids don't understand fundamentals\" Well motherfucker I'm gonna give you it. Throughout this post, I will be teaching metrics and explaining them, so before I am ripped a new asshole by the people who already know, **this post is for Newbies, and experts** so feel free to skip the bullshit comments like \"*I aLrEaDy KnOw WhAt ThE dEfEnItIoN oF vAlUaTiOn Is\".* Secondly, this shit takes wayyyyyyy too long for this to be buried into the feed of horrible DD, Literally do your part and upvote, so we can all be well informed. Trust me this shit is even boring to someone taking PED's but we deserve to be well informed.\n\n# Relative Valuation for ContextLogic Inc. performed by Baconnator69420.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nSo for those who are new to valuation, I will give my overall thesis as to why I am so bullish on the position ContextLogic. First off let's define what relative valuation is so that we can get a better understanding of why these metrics are useful.\n\n**Relative Valuation**\\- also called valuation using multiples is the notion of comparing the price of an asset to the market value of similar assets. In the field of securities investment, the idea has led to important practical tools, which could presumably spot pricing anomalies.\n\n*(for the dumbasses, comparing numbers to other companies numbers)*\n\n[**The 4 Important metrics when valuing a business is**](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/09/elements-stock-value.asp)\n\n* Price to Book Value or (P/B)\n* Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E)\n* Price to Earnings Growth (PEG)\n* Dividend Yield \\*Note this stock does not currently pay a dividend\\*\n\nFurther Fundamentals will be considered as we take apart the most recent filing for ContextLogic Inc.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Body** \n\nThe first metric we will be looking at is the price to book value of the company of ContextLogic. Price to Book essentially calculates the market value of the company and the intrinsic value of its actual holdings. Further explanation is what is the company actually worth without participating in the market. It is the calculation of all the assets the company currently holds. Most of this information will be pulled and calculated from the website [MacroAxis](https://www.macroaxis.com/stock/WISH/Contextlogic-Inc-Cl) so feel free to access the information Via the hyper-link.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Price to Book vs Current Valuation ](https://preview.redd.it/xnypsj1bln471.png?width=2020&format=png&auto=webp&s=48266c4526b6a9566f1f004253a199360eaf93f5)\n\nThis alone proves the overall undervaluation of the company ContextLogic. Looking on the X-axis we can see that in the market we have a similar Current Valuation to competitors, but are not trading at as high of a multiple as a company such as MELI, ZLNDY, or EBAY. These are all E-Commerce companies, CVNA will not be considered with Chip shortage because that is the sole reason it is trading at such a premium because they are in used cars. So looking similarly we can conclude that growth is to be expected as a company like ZLNDY trades at 13.68 P/B with a current valuation of 24.9B. Whereas $WISH has a 5.51 P/B. This allows us to conclude this could very well be a 50$ PT in the coming future.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Short Ratio to Total Debt ](https://preview.redd.it/4m4f3o8gpn471.png?width=2020&format=png&auto=webp&s=f971126f4839485580c02148c8277a6af83b0c98)\n\nThis analysis shows the total debt on the X-axis and the Short Ratio on Y-axis. Again CVNA will not be included. Similarly, we can point to the thesis that this company maintains low amounts of debt in fact the least amount of debt compared to other companies operating in E-commerce. The current short ratio is arguably pointing to the conclusion that this stock is heavily being targeted by shorts with not a lot of fundamentals to back it other than \"Wish sells shitty products\". That is a harmful thesis as we have a market expectation of high inflation. With high inflation, people will have less money which further affirms that customers will transition into secondary goods, AKA shitty $WISH products. This is not a bad thing. Another correlation to this is during times of economic downturn we see many consumers shopping at discount stores such as Dollar General or Dollar Tree. Overall the market is not very forward-thinking if we consider those facts alone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BF EV\\/Rev](https://preview.redd.it/8ouz8bsjtn471.png?width=2878&format=png&auto=webp&s=9affd94a41c074ade14d4fc15f7b1d1d54587bad)\n\nThe last part of this valuation will be my Price targets and analysis of the reasoning.\n\nThis is a [Bloomberg Quote Snapshot](https://bba.bloomberg.net/Content/Html5/Citrix/src/SessionWindow.html?launchid=1623427103961) at 12:05 EST June 11th, 2021\n\nBF EV/Rev quotes $WISH at a 1.3x multiple. We can consider based on previous research that this company maintains low debt, but trades at a low premium relative to earnings in this market. Competitor EV/Rev averages 6.2x multiple considering this metric we can conclude by doing some simple math 6.2x/1.3x = 4.7692307692x is the room for wish to grow. An almost 5 BAGGER HAHAH.

{"title": "A visual explanation to short squeezes", "selftext": "The year of 2021 will be one filled with market anomalies, but the one that took the market by surprise was the Gamestop short squeeze that was driven by a rally to take on short sellers from the WallStreetBets subreddit. Although short squeezes may seem simple, they are a bit complex when you *look under the hood.* This publication is meant to graphically show how short squeezes happen as well providing the mechanics on why they occur.\n\n**The mechanics behind longs and shorts**\n\nTo understand short squeezes we have to understand the mechanics of *longs* and *shorts.* Most investors usually invest using by *going long* on a stock. This is when an investor purchases the stock and then hopefully sells it a higher price in the future. A *short seller* is when an individual wants to bet against a stock hoping that it falls. But instead of selling the stock at a higher price for a profit, they want to *buy the stock back* at a lower price, we’ll get more into the short positions if this seems confusing now.\n\nShort sellers have all sort of motives, some short sellers are actively trying to take down companies (see activist [short sellers](https://www.hec.edu/en/knowledge/articles/how-activist-short-sellers-police-financial-markets#:~:text=Activist%20short%20sellers%20are%20a,corporate%20frauds%20or%20financial%20misstatements.)), some do it because they think the stock is overvalued, and others may do it to hedge out their portfolio (see [long short](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/long-shortequity.asp#:~:text=Long%2Dshort%20equity%20is%20an%20investment%20strategy%20that%20seeks%20to,%2Dvalued%20and%20over%2Dvalued.) strategy).\n\nWe won’t dive too deep on longs and shorts but below covers the relevant material to understand them. Here is a *simple* process for entering longs and shorts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/flhcbdv51p471.png?width=927&format=png&auto=webp&s=07b1a38557bb176decff9dca745e2118f3cbe623\n\nTo reiterate the most important part of these positions are\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/siavo5961p471.png?width=304&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f447c0639e8693a0f9e4ba887a0b76327470718\n\nWe can see that an investor that goes long has to **buy** to get into the position, and **sell,** to get out of the position. And a short seller has to **sell** to get into a position and **buy** to get out. (The technical terms for the short seller are **selling short,** and **buying to cover**).\n\n**Price Discovery Analysis**\n\nTo analyze a stock’s price we will use the price discovery method. We’ll start with a standard supply and demand curve for modeling stock prices. Although this explanation works in theory and the mechanics behind this model are applicable in real life, it is technically impossible to know the future movement of supply and demand curves. To do so would require one to know all of current and potential investors’ future decisions, which are hard to predict.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p2a50m371p471.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=2de58d6059ff1b46277d814224cbdae8f6538fe1\n\nIn this simple representation where supply stays constant, an increase in demand leads to a higher price and a decrease in demand leads to a lower price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9zviv8r71p471.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&s=6832c9ff03e755ef89c5c94028f8a31dbcd3ef2e\n\nEven though keeping supply constant is **not technically accurate,** it provides for a better visual explanation later\\*\\*.\\*\\* In general, changes in supply would mean that there are less or more sellers in the market.\n\n**Orderbook analysis**\n\nTo analyze movements in the stock we will examine the *orderbook*, which displays the type of order and the quantity of orders for a certain price. It shows how prices change with incoming bids and asks. The *bids* are the orders to buy the stock and the and the *asks* are the orders to sell the stock. In stock trading there is usually a slight difference between bids and asks (the *spread*), we can see that the spread between the highest bid ($125.82) and the lowest ask ($126.80). A *transaction* doesn’t occur until bid and ask agree upon a price (which would look like an order on each side of the price). So in this case if you were looking to buy the stock you would have to meet the lowest ask which is $126.80.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3uaq33l81p471.png?width=236&format=png&auto=webp&s=a599b5d90613f08f5a053d54d33e0d7e67bdfa56\n\nThis is a sample orderbook that I found from [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/). A live orderbook would be filled with a number of bids and asks in each column. Orderbook information can be found in your brokerage account if you have access to level II market data. I like to think of orderbook dynamics as forces moving against each other. For example if there are more buyers than sellers then, the green vector will be bigger than the red vector which will push the price up. If there are more sellers than buyers then the red vector will be bigger, which will push prices down.\n\nThe following is a different visual representation of bids and asks that shows volume. Looking at the bids (*green)* we can see that there is a preference to buy the stock at a lower price. As for the asks (*red*) the majority of sellers are looking to sell the stock at higher price.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/48bp2v491p471.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=e5e87c7ed77f97c6951b30cac740d3469e063406\n\n**Gamestop Example**\n\nNow let’s get into the mechanics behind a short squeeze, and in this case we will look at the Gamestop short squeeze which garnered a great deal of attention recently.\n\nIn this example we will start with 7 short positions. Each short position comes from a different short seller. We can see on the aggregate that the stock is downward trending for the most part. This works in the best interest of the short seller who **sells the stock and hopes to buy it back at a cheaper price**, and they will profit from the **difference**. We can also see that the short sell positions are represented with the *green* *profit bar* below the price they entered in at.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ojczn2t91p471.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=65987f0347a0ce2bed614323ceccab066a83f3cf\n\nNow let’s talk about how the short seller’s position may go awry. If the stock price increases which isn’t what the short seller wants and they begin to lose money, then are going to want to exit their position. Keep in mind that **exiting** a short position requires **buying** the stock back. This is *the bug* in short selling, its this little feature that creates a short squeeze. Let’s say a short seller wants out, they’ll buy the stock back, but also going back to our price discovery method, buying a stock **increases the demand**, which **increases the price**.\n\nThis is where the squeeze occurs, each short seller **exits** their position which pushes the price up, causing the next short seller to lose money.\n\nThe timeline of trades would look like this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qu3rdfma1p471.png?width=690&format=png&auto=webp&s=037cfe11ab1b3d42c0340167076f541828a48f62\n\nGraphically it would look like this with the price on left side and the supply and demand on the right side. We can see that when the short seller buys the stock back they increase the demand which increases price.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/og7139gb1p471.png?width=1891&format=png&auto=webp&s=d505e0a7ddc97c446fd4cf90f6beb413dec217d8\n\nWe can see that when this all starts to happen the price can dramatically increase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2zvr183c1p471.png?width=1548&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c50d93d517fff2c4c6d58d27b7761cd358452f4\n\n**Why Short Squeezes happen**\n\nThe main factor that contributes to short squeezes is that a short seller who is looking to exit their position has to **buy** the stock which pushes the price up, and that hits the next seller and so forth.\n\nSome short squeezes may occur naturally, although they rarely do. This can happen if a stock posts good quarterly results or makes a positive announcement. That increase in price could trigger a short squeeze. For example when famed activist short seller Citron Research ran by Andrew Left switched his short position on Tesla Inc, that created a short squeeze(see [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/23/short-seller-who-is-suing-tesla-changes-his-mind-tesla-is-destroying-the-competition.html)).\n\nIf short sellers succeed and push the price of the stock down then there is a risk that a short squeeze may occur. *Contrarian investors* which are investors that take *go against the grain* approach in investing may bet on a company who’s price is falling. Their purchase may cause a short squeeze, and its common for contrarian investors to try and garner public support which would rally investors. Value investors who constantly ask “*is this stock overvalued or undervalued?”* may see a stock that has been falling because of short sellers and say that its undervalued and buy up a bunch of shares causing a short squeeze.\n\nBut the most famous short squeezes that are studied come from market manipulation. This occurs when a trader or group of traders realize that with a large enough buy order will push the price up triggering a short squeeze.\n\nAlthough it feels like short squeezes have been happening a lot with talks about *meme stocks*, they actually don’t occur too often. I would assume that as markets calm when our lives fully revert back to normal (or whatever normal is post-pandemic) there will be less of these events.", "id": "nxozgb", "created_utc": 1623442132.0, "score": 129, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 45, "comments": [{"body": "I wrote up a TA on GMEs recent activity.

When you short sale you borrow a stock so you don't need to actually own it. Let's say it costs you around $1,000 to short sell $100,000 worth of stocks. If the value of the stock goes down 5% then you are in the hole around $4,000. You will get hit with a margin call which is when you have to cover the out of pocket cost. Usually you will exit the position or the broker will automatically liquidate your position and all other positions until they are made whole again.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "Couple inaccuracies in this. The margin requirement to short is generally 150% the value of the short. If you short $100,000 worth of stocks, you need to maintain $150,000 in marginable collateral. There is furthermore a cost to borrow, which is perhaps where the $1000 comes in.\n\nIf the stock goes down by 5%, then the position would be profitable for the short seller. They could buy back the shares for $95,000 and make a 5% profit.\n\nA margin call is when the required margin requirements are no longer met. In this example that could be if the stock goes up and you no longer have that 150%. Example, the shares double and now the short holding is worth $200,000. That requires a $300,000 in marginable collateral. Any difference in actual marginable collateral and required results in a margin call.\n\nWhen you exit a position to satisfy a margin call, it might not be sufficient to cover. When shorting the max loss is greater than the initial investment, this could require a deposit of funds. Even on long positions, if an account is totally wiped out, simple liquidation might not be enough to cover a margin call.\n\nLast, a brokerage uses their own discretion to liquidate positions, they can liquidate any positions.
