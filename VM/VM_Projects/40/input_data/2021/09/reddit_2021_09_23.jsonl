{"title": "Oil Rally and the incoming \"Transitory Inflation\"", "selftext": "Ok. So I have an opinion that we are finally seeing some real market analysis of the current tight oil environment. Inflation is here and we do not have enough oil to meet supply in the short term.\n\nBRING ON THE REST OF THE POST.\n\nPrevious Post: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n5dzl9/return_of_big_oil_the_death_of_oil_has_been/\n\nFirst off TLDR: XOM calls 1/22/22 $70-$80 and OXY 1/22/23 calls $40.\n\nUK in the past week has shown what happens when you do not have a steady supply of LNG.\n\nhttps://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/Gas-Crunch-Threatens-UK-Energy-Industry-With-Wave-Of-Bankruptcies.html\n\nCurrently, BOFA just announced that if we have colder than normal winter that the UK plants will switch from LNG to Oil which is literally bonkers. Based on their analysis oil would get to $100 in Q1 2022 and gas would run to $10 per gas.\n\nWhile I love reading what if scenarios, lets talk about the current supply and demand situation. Today, the EIA posted details about where we currently sit. (picture) As you can tell by reading numbers we are decreasing in storage in crude oil. Put simply we now are 20 million barrels away from the most bullish outlook that BOFA is speculating on for Q4 21 - Q1 22. In case you really want to dive in deeper here is a direct link to the EIA article posted about the Cushing storage in OK. https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=49636\n\nPut plainly, the reason I say that we are 20MMBO, (currently at 32.9 MMBO in storage), away from extremely bullish scenarios is that the graph through that link shows the storage levels from 2012-2021. This reduction would put the total around the 2014-2015 inventory level. (Roughly around 19MMBO in storage). The last time we hit this level of storage decline we saw in June was back in 1981 when the EIA started collecting data. Back during that time the price of oil increased from $94 per BO to $105 at the peak of low in storage. Currently at our pace of use due to exporting barrels and consumption I would roughly guess that we begin to have a \"crisis\" after the US E&P operators report Q3 earnings.\n\nLast time I spoke on this, I was posting information about the Rig count and drilled inventory (drilled but uncompleted wells) and true to that post the Rig Count has only slightly increased and the drilled count has reduced significantly. Meaning, if operators would like to keep the current production flat and return capital to shareholders we should begin seeing more rigs get added and the drilled count flatten.\n\nNow on to the fun stuff. Remember this is the musings of a madlad.\n\nHurricane Ida should have been a simple hurricane with little to no real damage to the offshore production and refining capacity. However, Shell has already stated that they are at 60% Gulf of Mexico production and it will not return to 100% until Q1 2022. Alongside this was the amount of barrels that were offline for 2-3 weeks outpaced 2-3 months of OPEC+ increases in BO supplied to the market. Thus, we are in a deficit of supply and we should see decreasing inventories over the next couple of months. https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=49576\n\nFinally, in regards to the elephant in the room, OPEC+. They continue to state that OPEC+ has the capacity to produce significantly higher barrels of oil. Please read this beasts post about how they don't have that capacity. https://twitter.com/BisonInterests/status/1440308387292475393\n\nSo lets combine the 3 criteria that I have listed in short hand.\n\nLow US crude 2. Shut off production 3. Falsified OPEC+ true max production Just like a steamroller coming head on we can see the impending issues but for some reason we can move out of the way. (Austin powers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_PrZ-J7D3k)\n\nImplied demand for oil is returning to the 2019 values and will continue to increase as we gear up for the upcoming holiday season. Not only will the vaccine induced holiday demand we saw over the summer continue but I would expect it to increase further.\n\nAll of the above market/macro information is required to understand the current energy market. While earlier in the year I was confident that this was going to happen sooner life just doesn't work that way. Right now, we have a couple companies that I think are undervalued and worth taking a look at:\n\nOXY calls 1/22/23 $40 XOM calls 1/22/22 $65 CPE calls 1/22/23 $45 Each are a little different and currently I am still up in the air about the 3rd option. But its worth mentioning.\n\nStarting with OXY, it is a very simple story of debt reduction, execution and FCF. OXY in this environment of $72 oil and $4.80 gas literally can paydown a couple billion dollars every quarter. Currently this year they have reduced debt by $3.0 Billion and $1.5 billion of extending debt further into the future. I do not like the management but the assets they own are incredible. Recently, the wells they turned online are outperforming their expectations (something they should highlight) by 20%. Essentially these well are making what other wells make in 8-10 months in 3-4 months. As long as they keep paying down debt and holding production flat they will payout more than almost any other company. (maybe the new ConocoPhillips will give them a run for their money). XOM is turning online their lowest cost barrels in both the Permian Basin and Guyana. In fact, they have found additionally pay zones that makes Guyana in development until the 2030's. That oil works at 38-45 per BO. Not to mention that they sell barrels around the world at Brent pricing. ($2-$3 per BO higher.) Last quarter they highlighted their refinery's making a significant amount of money but using a large portion for upgrades. But we should expect that they are the largest US E&P to return to form. Expectation is that post Q3 report we get debt reduction, increase in dividend (6.4% annually), and production increase. CPE. Honorable mention because they have 22% short interest and are a terrible company that needs $70 oil and $4 gas to survive. Surprisingly enough that's where we are at.

{"title": "SPY: The September yeet and October skeet — outlook for broad US market (Squeezemetrics-based analysis)", "selftext": "Sorry for the text wall, I will keep it brief. The selloff has concluded, the FOMC fired a blank on Taper Roulette, market makers have plenty of liquidity after a harsh OpEx, and DIX has plenty of room for growth. We also bounced off a strong SPX support and FAANG stocks are at stable short term levels. I hope you shorted VXX cause we’re about to mainline a pure dose of dealer liquidity into our economy.\n\nI expect a FCG or a gap up to 443 by Friday the 24th but it could on Monday because of FUD by dark buyers. From there we will see GEX dealers slow down their spending a bit (expect a bit of hesitation in the market midweek next week) and give DIX dark buyers more control over the price volatility as sentiment continues to get bullish and more non-dealer $$ is put into the market. I wouldn’t be surprised to see SPY hit 450 by October 4th. But then vanna & charm start to kick in and price gets more volatile as DIX buyers leave the market and liquidity dries up. However, because of the recent dip, GEX dealers will have to spend more of their liquidity to regain control of the market prices’ volatility from the dark pool (who has widened the bid/ask, which the dealers will fill). Btw the big crash will come when the dark pool has control of price volatility and GEX dealers have run out of liquidity; I think we’ll set a new ATH in December, double top in January 22, and then crash like crash down to sub-400 levels on SPY.\n\nThere are major announcements in early October so a dip catalyst will be either news or time spent on resistance levels (which is why I think the dip will be delayed until late in the 2nd week of October i.e 6-8th). Whenever the market is on the edge of some weird shit like not reaching a new ATH, meme stocks and weed stocks seem to pop so expect that anytime between the 27th and 8th on all your favorites meme tickers.\n\nKeep in mind with SqueezeMetrics: You never want DIX to be crossed on the way up! GEX rising above DIX will stagnate price growth a lot b/c MM has control of the liquidity. If this happens, be weary.\n\n \n\nTLDR; no more dipping in September, SPY 441 tomorrow, SPY 445 by next Friday, SPY 450 by October 4. All meme stocks and weed stocks to yeet to varying levels in the next 2 weeks. Prepare for another big market dip to start around Oct 6-8th-ish and expect it to end on Oct. 18th-19th.\n\n \n\n***Keep in mind if we set new all time highs right away or hold this level on the indices, all of this is fucked.

{"title": "Markets are still very BULLISH. Don't let Evergrande fear-mongering get you!", "selftext": "If you don't like to read a lot, here is the summary: MARKETS ARE STILL BULLISH AND WE WILL SEE MULTIPLE NEW RECORD HIGHS ALL MAJOR AMERICAN INDICES REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH EVERGRANDE.  WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH EVERGRANDE IS NOT GOING TO CREATE A 2008 LIKE GAY MAN BROTHERS MOMENTS HERE IN AMERICA! Whatever correction happens in the name of evergrande in sep/oct will quickly disappear and there will be new highs.\n\nThat is all you need to know. But if you like to read, more, go ahead.\n\nEvergrande is close to collapse and the western MSM is conditioning the mass to believe it is going to be 2008 global financial meltdown all over again. Calm down – it isn’t.\n\nEvergrande group is China's second largest property developer, is seemingly on the verge of bankruptcy. It’s one of the biggest in the world, however, it finds itself swamped in over $300 billion of liabilities and is struggling to repay its debts, sending it tumbling towards a risk of default and insolvency.  Evergrande stock is falling, and predictably its pending fate is sending shockwaves and fears across markets worldwide, something the mainstream media lap up because they always love a good scare story about China, not least its economy.\n\nAs a result, there has been a tsunami of msm articles branding the situation as China's “Gayman Brothers Moment”. Now, inevitably, commentators are predicting the same thing, pointing out that Evergrande’s demise could rattle not just China’s own economy, but go far beyond that. A number of prominent western financial institutions have bought the company’s bonds, and would take a hit if the firm can’t meet its obligations in the coming weeks. Many speculate as to whether the Chinese government might bail Evergrande out.\n\nBut let’s be clear: Evergrande is not another Gayman Brothers in the making. One of the reasons why there is such an excessive circus around this is not just because of legitimate fears regarding the fate of this firm, but that in the media discourse of China there is a cult of abject hysteria and a lust for negativity. Western media likes nothing better than to seize on anything remotely bad pertaining to this country, hyping it into excessively dramatic and apocalyptic news. Another is that its around that time of the year where the Big Bulls throw a bone in a trap to the Bears to shake the weak hands off before the markets sets even further new highs.\n\nEvery event within China is reported with the worst possible outcome. For example, China was facing an apparent nuclear disaster just months ago. The initial outbreak of Covid-19 was framed as China's “Chernobyl moment” and a threat to the political system itself in 2020, as were the Hong Kong protests the previous year. The Three Gorges Dam is always apparently “set to collapse”. The list goes on and on. We all know there’s a certain author who over 20 years ago penned a book titled “The Coming Collapse of China” – and in some ways his thesis is reflective of this “doomcasting” approach to China, which seems to stem from the inherent belief that the country’s political and economic system is inevitably going to fail, or, rather, the fervent hope that it does.\n\nThis unhelpful media environment creates white noise and a distraction for what is actually happening, and so it is with Evergrande. The firm may be on its knees, but there is a calculated reason why Beijing, so far at least, is allowing it to go to the brink. It’s both for economic and political reasons – there’s no lack of oversight or negligence here.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Xi Jinping’s rule has taken a much harder line against what is perceived to be unsustainable, debt fuelled growth. He dislikes firms bingeing on extreme amounts of debt to achieve short-term growth goals which have no sustainability. It is this kind of uncontrolled spending which was at the heart of Gordon Chang's 2000 thesis; the belief that financial unsustainability would bring down the system.\n\nBut China has in fact been steering away from that, and the emphasis under Xi has been to control the supply side, limit excessive lending and produce economic growth which is lower, but nonetheless more organic and sustainable. When the Covid crisis hit China’s economy last year, it noticeably avoided the mega stimulus inputs the US and UK resorted to.\n\nThis economic strategy is one of the reasons why under Xi’s rule China’s annual growth has been hauled down from about 10% to 6%, precisely because going overboard is dangerous. Part of this strategy has been to send out a warning to companies that if you build your business in an unsustainable way and go under, “We're not saving you and we will let you fail”. Hence the number of defaulting companies in China has increased. It’s to force business to be more efficient and thus to create a more productive, better structured economy.\n\nBut the question still remains, will Evergrande go under and produce a financial crisis? Again, no, or at least not in the way it is expected to. For the time being, the Chinese government is hanging Evergrande out to dry in order to send a political warning to others: that no firm is too big to fail and political intervention is not guaranteed.\n\nAnother theory is that it is prepared to let Evergrande sink because it does not want the country’s real-estate market to overheat, for property and asset prices to escape affordability; a potential real-estate bubble has been another potential pitfall for China’s growth. Thus, for a multitude of carefully considered reasons, Beijing is withholding its intervention as major economic consequences stem from it.\n\nThat does not mean that China’s government will do nothing. Its financial system does not operate in the way those in the West do. All of its major banks are state owned. The government can impose its own controls and rules as it sees fit and simply “defy economic gravity” – precisely why theses of its collapse have been so frequently wrong.\n\nThe government may let the firm itself die, but step in to pay off its creditors and investors, because in no circumstances does China want to be branded responsible for a global financial crisis or meltdown, not least in this new era of scapegoating Beijing for everything. There are many solutions to this crisis, but China has seemingly made a political decision that the status quo cannot continue; firms fuelling themselves on debt like this cannot go on as normal without serious reform.\n\nIn this case, the mainstream media do as they always do, and doom-monger about China. There is nothing relished more, hoped or anticipated for than a crisis which fuels people’s ideological wishes that something is about to change China’s political status quo.\n\nEvergrande is just the latest subject of this misplaced and abject hysteria. Going beyond the headlines, China wants to end an economic growth trajectory fuelled upon nothing but debt, and that’s what it is doing. Even if by some miracle Evergrande gets out of this mess, Xi Jinping has some tough lessons for it. It’s in his political interest to make the firm feel pain, for the sustainable growth of China as a whole.\n\nIf you made it this far congrats. Remember, multi year bear market will eventually come but not yet. Markets are still very very bullish and we will see multiple record new highs before the year is over and into 2022. There is apparently going to be an epic bull run...i highly recommend looking up \"betting resource\" and reading the quarterly outlook for guidance. Much better than any msm and some great under the radar tickers for options and stocks.
