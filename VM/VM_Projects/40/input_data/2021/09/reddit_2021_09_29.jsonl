If it does not, America would default for the first time in history,\" Yellen said in the remarks. \"The full faith and credit of the United States would be impaired, and our country would likely face a financial crisis and economic recession.\"\n\nFor investors, the plethora of overlapping debates in Washington could be a near-term source of more market choppiness.”\n\nThanks", "id": "pxkfyw", "created_utc": 1632877639.0, "score": 25, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 49, "comments": [{"body": "There’s a 99% chance they’ll pass something.

The coupon is the canary in the coal mine and the principal is a mine tunnel.  If the canary keels over, the mine shaft is about to collapse.  They key component of the debt ceiling is the return of principal.  This is accomplished by creating more debt (a significant portion of which is used to hand principal back to bill/note/bond holders, with the implicit expectation that they will just hand it back for another bill/note/bond).  This particular instance of reserve currency banks on continuous growth, with countries needing to maintain a stock of US based debt to settle their external trade (and very specifically, for oil importation).\n\nMore immediately, if the Treasury General account lacks the money to pay the coupon on the various outstanding bill/note/bonds it has issued, it will revert to a mode of operation where outgoing payments are restricted in order to make those coupon payments, thus saving the USA from the embarrassment of not being able to make its \"minimum monthly payment\" on the credit card for which the world is co-signed.  This is the \"dreaded\" government shutdown and one day it may become something other than a political exercise.\n\nUnfortunately, if the USA enters an extended period of curtailed outgoings (typically government worker salaries, social security payments, and the like), the USA will enter a recession (such is the nature of Keynesian economics).  What that looks like on the ass-end of a global pandemic is not something we have data for and could very well have unintended consequences.\n\nGoing into a recession will increase the need for the US to demonstrate that it is \"good for it\", which typically means higher interest rates (and, consequently, higher taxes).  Unfortunately, the USA has created so much debt that there is a de facto maximum interest rates that the USA can tolerate (probably somewhere just above 4%).\n\nTypically, once the USA exhausts all of its outgoing curtailment options, it will miss coupon payments.  This will probably be prioritized so that domestic holders get screwed first, because, once  a single coupon payment to foreign holders is missed, those foreign holders will start handing their bills/notes/bonds back in well in advance of the bill/note/bond's term.  This is done so that they can get the principal owed before the USA become so insolvent that it goes completely bankrupt and defaults on everything.  Somewhat unsurprisingly, the act of handing a bill/note/bond in early actually accelerates the bankruptcy/default process (so, if countries are going to do this, they need to do it early and often; this is the equivalent of being in a mine shaft where a bunch of miners are running for the exit even though *your* canary is still alive).\n\nThis early \"canary alive, but other miners running for the exit\" stage has actually happened before, but the process was stopped by Volcker, who jacked interest rates up to 18% in an effort to keep foreign holders of bills/notes/bonds, well, holding (also during this period, for a very brief time, oil was traded in gold).  So don't believe Janet Yellen when she tells you non-sense about it having never happened before.  BTW, the option of stopping early hand-in of US bills/notes/bonds and preventing a general move towards some other unit of account (countries have options now) for international trade settlement simply does not exist because of the >4% interest limitation on existing debt.  The only real way forward from that situation is outright default.  \n\nThe only thing that is stopping this process from happening again is that there is a general consensus that, should a country attempt to transact oil in something other than US dollar, the USA will do one of two things (probably both eventually):  1) prevent countries from using US dollars for *anything* (there are a bunch of countries on this shit list... Iran, North Korea, Russia, etc.) and 2) show up on said country's door step with an Aircraft Carrier Group ready to distribute a little \"freedom\" to the offender (AKA fuck up its infrastructure, setting back the country's progress by multiple decades).  As even Europe is experiencing with Nordstream, the USA often has an ever expanding list of \"no-no's\" that will bring action.  The motivation to move away from US dollar reserve currency is strong, but there's no effective way to do it without completely fucking up the world economy (and make no mistake, the only reason modern society exists in its current form is because of the globalized nature of the world economy).", "score": 19, "replies": []}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "It's not really the Dems fault though, is it?

There might be some value in putting XLNX FPGA arrays on AMD chips but it's a niche within a niche, not the vast meadow of easy money you need it to be.\n\n>5) AMD's acquisition of XLNX opens a door for AMD to break into the growing, profitable 5G market  \n\nAbsolutely nothing was stopping them and they're years late to that party. 5g isn't growing, the majority of the value in it was taken as low-hanging fruit already. Adding gigabit wifi to Teddy Ruxpin dolls isn't going to reduce the vast Goodwill charge that's coming to AMD shareholders' future.\n\n>6) AMD's acquisition of XLNX gives AMD a jumpstart toward Software-Defined Silicon (SDSi) and/or Software-Defined Compute\n\nOld tech. Xilinx does that now, and doesn't make as much profit from it as AMD makes from its existing business lines. Combining the companies won't refresh it or make it more profitable.\n\n>>...a stodgy technology vendor with little to no synergy...\n\n>XLNX earns over $3B a year and is growing that revenue at double-digit rates... how is that \"stodgy?\" I've already covered your lack of understanding on synergy.\n\nYou're projecting on who understands what.\n\nFirst XLNX *revenue* is $3B. Its *earnings* are $600-800M and those have been flat for many years, and actually declining 20% since 2019 despite revenue growing 20% to that 3B in 2019.\n\nXLNX is not a growth center, which is why synergy has to be the focus, and the lack of it is key to understanding the problem here \n\nThe only way AMD improves XLNX is if they overhaul the crufty, confusing development system that comes with XLNX products and increases the velocity of design wins before XLNX FPGA gets replaced by some better software-customizable hardware methodology. There's no way XLNX improves AMD enough to be a good value.\n\nI'll accept that you don't actually know what you're talking about and admit that I don't have all the information in the world, so I'll wait for someone else to find a way this deal makes a net profit for AMD.\n\nMeanwhile, take a gold star; you can have one of Lisa's.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Dang dude.
