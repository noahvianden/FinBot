{"title": "URA $37C Jan 2023 DD", "selftext": "Uranium is currently being “squeezed” by our friend Sprott. A brief run down of what’s happening with uranium right now with rough numbers:\n\nThe disarmament of nuclear weapons in the 2000’s has supplied a large surplus of uranium for the past ~13 years. Uranium spot price dropped so much that many mines went under and significantly cut production/shut down.\n\nCurrently 190 million pounds of Uranium is consumed each year and only 140 million pounds produced. It is unknown how much secondary supply from warheads is left. Most consumers buy direct from miners and the spot market is very illiquid trading 50 million pounds a year, much if it being futures contracts that never see physical delivery.\n\nOn August 16th Sprott Uranium Trust (SPUT) opened for business. This is similar to PSLV where the more shares of it are purchased the more capital is available to purchase physical, except these facilities allow uranium to be stacked safely being radioactive and all. Since the 16th SPUT has purchased over 6 million pounds of uranium being the catalyst driving spot price from $30.30 to $40.40 now with a green close EVERYDAY! A feedback loop has been formed where more people are FOMOing into uranium from seeing the price run, more capital for SPUT to buy more uranium, causing the price to rise further.\n\nNo producer can instantly bring production back online and it will take investment capital and many months to do so. A short pop in spot price means nothing. They need to see months of $60+ being sustained. The demand is NOW. This could launch uranium to $100+, since lots of companies went under or are shut down all the money will be going into current producers. The gains will (and have been) happening very fast with so few stocks to choose from.\n\nURA is a ETF with long dated call options available. To fully realize this bull market you need options with leaps.
