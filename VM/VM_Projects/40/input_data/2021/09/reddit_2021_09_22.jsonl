There are many bearish arguments, but most of them don't hold up. Some common ones that I don't worry about are:\n\n1. **Growth will slow down, due to the company's size.** Yeah, no--you could've said that about any mega-cap tech company in the last ten years at any time, and you'd have been wrong. There's no fundamental rule that growth must slow down as a company grows (just look at the recent YoY comps for any mega-cap tech company in their last quarterly report).\n2. **P/E too high.** The company's earnings growth has actually outperformed its stock growth over the last few years, so if anything it's getting relatively cheaper over time (especially the last year). If you used P/E as a judge of price, you missed out on AMZN years ago.\n3. **AWS competition.** All the evidence I've seen is that AWS not only growing, but that growth is actually accelerating. It does face competition--but that's not an argument not to hold AMZN, that's an argument to also hold its competition.\n4. **Decreasing quality of their retail arm.** There's a general consensus on Reddit that Amazon's 'flooded' with fake Chinese sellers. This seems to be an exaggeration from what I can see, but even if true, Amazon is [taking steps](https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680269/amazon-ban-chinese-brands-review-abuse-fraud-policy) to weed out bad actors. Fake reviews happen on any big e-commerce site, and their retail is a small component of their valuation anyway.\n\nNow, there are two bearish arguments I do take seriously:\n\n1. **New CEO.** There was nothing pre-ordained about Amazon's success--that has to be attributed to Bezos. We have no idea how good a CEO Jassy will be. Lots of investors remember the disaster that Balmer was for MSFT, and will want to see evidence that Jassy is a Nadella.\n2. **Anti-trust.** Amazon is ripe for anti-trust, as it does have a history of anti-competitive behavior, and is generally unpopular with both Congress and the general public. If Amazon gets broken up that will be good for investors in the long term, but in the short term the hearings would probably weigh down the stock--and it's not necessarily a given that the result of the hearings would be a break-up. There are other penalties that could be used instead.\n\nNow, me personally, these arguments aren't good enough to justify decreasing my position.

Amazon is almost never the best price. As technology gets better, shipping times for the industry as a whole will compress. Right now it might be 2 days vs 7 days and in the future it could be 1 day vs 2 days or same day vs 1 day.
