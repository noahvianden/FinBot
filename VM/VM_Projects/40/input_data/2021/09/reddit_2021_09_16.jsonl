TTCF is a company witch rock solid fundamentals!", "selftext": "Tattooed chef is a vertically integrated food company which means higher margins than its competitors. Plant based food are a growing industry and Tattooed chef is positioned to increase market share. This is NOT just frozen food company. They are soon getting in to salty snacks and LAtin American food!\n\nOver 40% Short Interest - very high!\n\nCEO has worked in food business for over 35 years and his daughter is creative designer of the food products.\n\nTattooed Chef is a plant-based food brand. They are available in stores like Kroger, Target, Walmart, Costco, and Sam's Club. The company is entirely vertically integrated which gives them a massive edge of the competition. They have been building manufacturing infrastructure since 2010. This company has great growth potential and is rapidly expanding.\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ikfjyo664wn71.jpg?width=474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=335728dec8703b67c4e939dd8215be91b3550581\n\nRevenue in the range of $235 million to $242 million, an increase of 58 to 63% compared to 2020. This guidance excludes any revenue contribution from the Karsten facility which is currently not in operation. The Company expects to update guidance when production begins at that facility in the coming months.\n\nGross margin in the range of 20% to 25%\n\nTTCF has a current market cap of 1.69B which is tiny\n\nInsiders own 38% of the company\n\nThey've spent like very little on advertising. They developed a plan to hit 2 billion impressions in the form of 6 and 16 second videos in the first 8 months of 2021. This is the first time they're spending advertising dollars and they have already built up a loyal following. You can see on Twitter posts of pictures of local Target frozen shelves being out of TTCF stock. Search Twitter for $TTCF and you'll see them. Also the comments on TTCF's official twitter account have stuff like \"yo get the product in my target please, it's always out of stock\" and \"when you gonna be in Europe please\". They have a very popular product that is flying off the shelves. Before 2021, their only sales team was the CEO and his daughter. Now, they've hired marketing teams to get them into more retail stores, like an ex-Coca Cola national sales manager to boost marketing. \n\nEurope has a strong demand for their products, as plant-based proteins are growing in popularity. TTCF has 2 manufacturing plants, one in California and one in Italy. One their last conference call, they mentioned buying more plants and expanding into Europe.\n\n TTCF has very low IV and SI of over 30%. It is currently one of the most shorted stocks on the market. This is a stock with solid fundamentals and rapid growth. In my opinion calls are not priced accordingly and you seeing this early could get in on the ground floor while IV is still laughably low. Volume on it is low as well and the float is on the smaller side. If you are able to get in while IV is low this thing could take off. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gs9z5rg54wn71.jpg?width=474&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f1b8f8ea616fa18917efeb72b03d289cf4cac9df\n\nI have 9310 shares at 19.50 a share", "id": "ppgfdy", "created_utc": 1631808947.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.59, "num_comments": 41, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|14|**First Seen In WSB**|2 months ago\n**Total Comments**|150|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pl0s1r/i_have_30000_shares_of_this_stock_sdc_has/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pcdhe9/tomorrow_is_corsair_day_crsr_stock_next_to_short/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/odbjhg/ttcf/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pemulg/buying_the_dip_on_crsr_stock_big_gains_ahead_lets/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pbbqxg/crsr_going_to_the_moon_soon_buckle_up_apes/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ppgfdy/this_40_shorted_stock_is_about_to_boom_baby_ttcf/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pjfd61/2x_coming_fast_sdc_stock_a_buy_910_dentists/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pfir7e/attention_retarded_apes_this_week_is/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pfit5f/attention_apes_this_is_smileclubdirect_week_10x/) \n**Account Age**|2 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "\\+60% revenue growth BEFORE they landed an additional 4,000 stores.
