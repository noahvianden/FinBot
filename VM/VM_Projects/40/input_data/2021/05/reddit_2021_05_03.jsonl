At the moment Ericsson is getting more orders for executing 5G infrastructure deployments and they have been diversifying at better pace than Nokia into a IT services company. Due to this, There is a credible threat that Nokia would be no more in 3-4 years even if they get new 5G orders as income would dry up in future. Also, Ericsson cannot buy/merge with Nokia due to competition law in US as Ericsson will have more than 70% market share if it happens, giving Ericson monopoly in this sector.
