Each month I sell OTM calls, 1 month out, at a strike price there if I get assigned I still make a *decent* return and I would also buy again the underlying security (yes I know about wash sale and I am willing to go for it)\n3. The goal is each month to pocket the premiums and have the calls expire worthless; then do it again and again.\n\n**These are my questions:**\n\n* is there a source, book or article, from someone who has researched this?\n* my guess is that a stock with high volatility will have the greater premium, something like $TSLA more than $SPY\n* any other suggestions are welcome.", "id": "5yuty6", "created_utc": 1489265490.0, "score": 13, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 40, "comments": [{"body": "Look into selling cash secured puts.

However, I think your strategy has some inconsistencies.\n\n1. \"...hold for the very long term.\" This is not really the purpose of selling a contract to someone and providing them the right to buy your stock.\n\n2. That's a fine strategy. But, you shouldn't have wash sales unless you're really screwing up the sale price on the option. You may potentially have a bunch of short-term capital gains and may potentially never have a long-term capital gain.\n\n3. Sure, that's always the goal. But, you're going to have different market environments that may disrupt that plan. Stocks don't move in an orderly fashion thus the reason why options have value (uncertainty/time/cash flow).\n\nVolatility: Yes, your premiums are going to be higher on a more highly volatile stock. If you're starting your analysis seeking return, do expect some very big surprises with very volatile stocks. Options are akin to insurance. You can bet that a house won't burn down in the next two months and it probably won't so you'll probably not get a lot of premium for it. If you look at an entire area and write that nobody will have their house burn down in the next two months you'll take in a lot more cash and you're probably going to be paying for someone's house. In this example, a highly volatile stock is possibly not your friend because if you find something that really moves to the upside you're only collecting the premium and if it crashes to the downside you're holding onto the loss (but you just won big on your option! 100% gain).\n\nCovered calls are a conservative strategy. Understand your risk and your reward. You are surrendering upside potential in exchange for a guarantee. You are also holding all of the downside risk minus the premium received.\n\nI would suggest not ever using a covered call strategy through a company earnings report. Why? That stock may gap a huge amount one way or the other. You'll get a slightly fatter premium due to vol increase but if you own a company and their stock jumps 10, 20, 30% on the news you get to keep your premium and sell the stock to someone else. If the stock drops 10, 20, 30% you get to keep the stock and the premium earned.

Also got a handful of April $28 strikes.  They were all making money but I liquidated most on Friday unfortunately too soon for a different trade that I couldn't pass up.  Still holding some, plan to dump most, gamble with a few.  \n\n\nWith the covered call, I'm sure you are right, like I said I have no experience with them.  Just trying to understand.  \n\nEx: \nI own 100 shares of ABC.  ABC is trading at 25 on wed before earnings, (announced after close) and a $28 call is selling for $1.00.
