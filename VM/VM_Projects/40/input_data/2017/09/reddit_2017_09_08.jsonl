Set auto buy back at 50% max profit-- and enjoy nearly free money.\n\nDue to vol being mean reverting that works 90+% of time.

When you buy premium you are essentially paying for the gamma so to refer to it as 'gamma risk' is misguided. \n\n> (you) will not profit from vol increase\n\nYes OP could. He owns a call in the VIX he will profit if vol increases enough to cover the cost of the position which wouldn't take some black swan event, just a normal spike.\n\n> 45 DTE to expiration is cycle you wanted (Oct 18)\n\nNot necessarily. 45 DTE is not some magical timeframe conducive to every strategy. I realize it is part of the tastytrade mantra but if we give OP the benefit of the doubt he is playing this weekend like a binary event and made the correct decision to use the chain immediately following the assumed event.\n\n\n", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for being the voice of reason.
