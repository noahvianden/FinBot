Thus it should traded at $17.68 pre-dividend and $17.36 post dividend.\n\nBAC-B was worth $0.21 pre-dividend and $0.00 post dividend.\n\nThat is why BAC-B blows, until the dividend increases and even then, it still blows comparatively speaking.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for this. So BAC-A would be a better long position to have if you expect BAC to hit $31.00 in a year? ", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.\n\nIt's like buying the stock, but you can basically lever up 2:1.\n\nBAC-B would have been a good deal if... BAC upped the dividend right after the crisis. Now, once the BAC-B warrants expire before the BAC-A warrants, there should be a rise since that reduces the dilution of BAC.\n\nNow, if you want 6% ROC while you wait, then BAC-L, the $1,000-par issue. It pays a dividend of $72.50 a year, or 7.25% at par. The yield stands at 6.0%, now with the price at ~$1,200.\n\nBut what about the conversion risk? BAC-L can be converted into 20 shares of common stock if Bank of America's common stock exceeds 130% of $50 for 20 out of 30 consecutive trading days. Doing the math, 130% times $50 times 20 is $1,300. Even if you do get converted, it means the stock was above $65 for 20 straight trading days. They cannot redeem it, they can only force a conversion to common. So you are still holding 20 shares at $$65, unless if fell off a cliff the last 9 days.\n\nIn other words, if the bank called away the preferred you bought at $1,200, you would get a nice capital gain. In reality, there isn't much risk that BAC common (now around $23) will get to $65 anytime soon. The 6.0% yield on cost is good for the foreseeable future.\n\n", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks, gunna look more into this ", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "buuut..
