But markets don't always go up. A quick look at an all time chart of the Nikkei 225 will make that pretty clear.\n\nThe reason the U.S. markets have averaged such high growth is because the U.S. has always had consistently high GDP growth. Japan, on the other hand, seems to have entered a period of permanent stagnation. The question is--can that happen to the U.S.?\n\nThe slow growth we are seeing in the post recession era is unprecedented. In the past, the U.S. saw huge deviations in growth rates, and like the article says, there were many contractions and expansions (the conventional boom/bust cycle). The Keynesian theory essentially dictates when the economy slows, central banks should lower rates, which should lead to another boom. Inflation will rise, and then the Fed can raise rates again. The economy then teeters for a bit before falling into another bust, and then the cycle repeats itself. Uncontrollable inflation and deflation are both very bad, so the Fed acts to prevent either of those two outcomes. The problem is that the U.S. seems to be entering a period of prolonged deflation, where even 0% interest rates can't stimulate \"normal\" growth. The U.S. has *never* gone this long without a year of >3% GDP growth. We've now gone 11 years without one. There is a huge fear amongst economics that if we fall into another recession, the Fed won't be able to lower rates enough to avoid entering a permanent deflationary spiral like Japan.\n\nhttp://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/terence-p-jeffrey/us-has-record-11th-straight-year-without-3-growth-gdp\n\nIf low growth is indeed the new normal, stock market yields will decrease too.\n\n>You are not going to get the same percentage growth in an $18 trillion economy as you would in an economy half that size. Expecting the percentage growth to be the same or higher now would mean an exponentially growing economy forever, which is not going to happen.\n\nThe U.S. *has* experienced exponential growth from the 1870s until the modern day. There is a huge debate raging in economic circles as to whether or not this 130 year trend is over.\n\nhttps://aneconomicsense.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/long-run-us-gdp-per-capita-growth-1870-2011-in-logarithms.png\n\n>We are growing the GDP faster now than in any previous recovery in real terms, because the economy is much bigger now than it used to be.\n\nThis statement is so idiotic it actually made me dumber just reading it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">The slow growth we are seeing in the post recession era is unprecedented.\n\nYou yourself admit that the growth was slower after the great depression, which you don't count. You also don't count all of human history before that. It is only slow as a percentage of GDP, as opposed to an absolute rate, plus its a LONG recovery, so it makes sense the growth would be more spread out and stable.\n\n>The Keynesian theory essentially dictates\n\nKeynes is not the god of economics.

We've now gone 11 years without one. There is a huge fear amongst economics that if we fall into another recession, the Fed won't be able to lower rates enough to avoid entering a permanent deflationary spiral like Japan.\n\nJapan's economy didn't eat shit because of some hocus pocus deflationary spiral, it never recovered properly because it has a terrible corporate/business culture and terrible economic governance.\n\nAs long as people work hard for a living doing productive and valuable things, wealth will increase over time. It's just that simple. Wealth gets destroyed when you have bad investment and inefficient investment wasting growth potential. That's why I think socialists and big government liberals are such a huge threat to the economy. They parasite on the economy and drain it of strength, and seem to think it is some limitless renewable resource for them to plunger for \"social justice\" bullshit.\n\n>If low growth is indeed the new normal, stock market yields will decrease too.\n\nMoney flows to the best investments. The US stock market keeps growing because more and more money keeps being pumped into it from all over the world, not just the US economy. The US stock market drops when people sell off. When people sell off they need to put there money somewhere. So why should people sell off when there is no better place to invest their money? \n\n>The U.S. has experienced exponential growth from the 1870s until the modern day. There is a huge debate raging in economic circles as to whether or not this 130 year trend is over.\n\nExponential growth can't continue forever, and it is only natural to see growth slow as the overall size of the economy increases. Even China is slowing down. Japan slowed down but learned the wrong lessons and therefore didn't recover. The only ways to get economic growth are to add population or to add productivity. We had a lot of productivity gains from the computer revolution, but not so much lately. New technology could come along and boost productivity, but the most likely scenario now is robotics/automation which people are resisting because DEY TOOK URR JARBS.\n\n>This statement is so idiotic it actually made me dumber just reading it.\n\nIt isn't, and comments like that are going to make it very difficult for me to respond to you in a civil fashion.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "this is very possible, but so is the bull run continuing for another 6 months. who knows tbh", "score": 8, "replies": []}, {"body": "well are you buying long puts? thats the real question!
