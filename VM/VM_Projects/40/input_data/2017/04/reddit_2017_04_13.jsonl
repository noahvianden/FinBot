His first try to pass actual legislation was an abject failure and the GOP was exposed as being completely inept.  6 years to find a better solution for Obamacare and they failed. Ok.  This was a major setback for Trump and the GOP.  Getting any significant legislation passed is going to be that much harder for him now that Dems are emboldened and the GOP will just fight each other.  The entire rally hit a wall when that vote failed, then he comes out and says \"no tax reform until Healthcare is done\"   If your dick was the market, the GOP just left it there with blue balls.
