Some people would advocate for the things he did. I'm not one of those people. There are a few things that I strongly disliked about him. Not him specifically but what he did as a president. \n\n1) the ACA. I believe it was a good concept, however I wish that it would've had a higher requirement to receive. Only to vets or disabled persons. It greatly reduced the incentive to work. People say. It reduced unemployment, and that is true. However that's only because the amount of people who were unemployed but were looking for jobs, dropped. Less people were \"looking\" for jobs so the unemployment rate dropped as a result, not because less people were jobless. \n\n2) his funding on education. What was it, nearly 10 billion for minimal impact? I believe those who want to succeed will, and those who are destined to fail will fail. Regardless of how much money you put into the schools. It doesn't matter if the kids home lives are messed up. No amount of iPads or fancy projectors will help them. \n\n3) this is the one that stands out the most to me. He was at war every day or his 8 year term. I agree that this was bush's flaw as well, the war on terror. I hate that and the war on drugs. But Obama didn't do anything to end that bullshit, he escalated it. \n\nThe only achievement I can think of is re-surfacing racial tension. \n\nThese are all things he did that did. Not agree with my beliefs. He created a lot of debt, I can't even fathom the amount of innocent deaths he has on his hands (other countries). Some may disagree and that's fine. That's their opinion and this is mine.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1) How would ACA reduce the incentive to work?  You do know that the USA is one of the very, very few major countries (not third world ones) without  total health care like the UK, Canada, https://truecostblog.com/2009/08/09/countries-with-universal-healthcare-by-date/  etc.  I don't see them those countries having a problem with unemployment or people on the dole. \n\nHealthcare for an individual should not be tied to work, because you can work somewhere and still not get it or get a piss poor policy.  That's ridiculous.  If you get laid off or fired, and have a family you should still be able to go to a doctor without getting further into debt.  Remember this:  Obama wanted a better plan, but the Republicans would not work with him.   Now tRump wants to abolish it, and have a BIG, BETTER plan, we'll see what this a-hole comes up with.  \n\n2)  As far as education I'm for that too.  Not everyone in the USA has the money nor did they start out with all the privileges as say someone in the middle class, a WASP, etc.  Some people fail due to no fault of their own.  If you have not experienced that you are not old enough to have experienced it or just deluded.  \n\n3) At least Obama tried to keep American's from engaging in wars, and tried to wind down some of the Middle East strife.  I'm for that too.  He kept American boys out of harm's way, but you don't see many that appreciate that nor are even aware of it.  As far as he escalated it, I tend to disagree.  I guess we'll see what Trump can do, but I won't hold my breath.  You don't seem to give Obama any credit (the troops really, but under Obamas terms) of killing Bin Laden.  Would you rather be engaged in war all the time, loosing arms and legs, or more separatist?   Looks like we'll be in war, even more so now with Trump.   He's not exactly extending friendship, in fact, so far he's been pretty offensive to some of our allies, if not our own fellow citizens. \n\nYou can only think of re-surfacing racial tension???   What about getting us out of a big financial depression?  Look it up.  All these things I'm talking about are facts, not bullshit like Trump has been known to spout off, then retracts, the switches and flipflops on. \n\nWhat about getting the car manufacturers solvent again?  Mitt  Romney wanted to let them crash and burn.\n\nWhat about getting a steady a bull market due to him being a stable president?  Look where the market was after George W and where it went.  You can look these facts up, don't stick your head in the sand and be stupid, make your computer work for you and get smarter.  Stop using conventional wisdom, which is just another way of saying an unformed opinion.\n\nWhat about lowering unemployment, do you know what it was when he left office?  Here are the facts, you might want to jot these down to gauge against what Trump will do in his four years:\n\nGasoline is around $2.30 a gallon\n\nThe Dow is around 19,870 points   We had a great bull market.\nThe S & P 500 around 2,270 points\nNASDAQ around 5,555\n\nUnemployment around 4.7%  Lower quite substantially.  \n\nYou might want to check a few items at the grocery store too like fruit, coffee, bread etc. from countries.  I suspect some of those are going to go up depending on what happens between us and Mexico like coffee, avocados, tomatoes, etc.   If the Mexicans don't pay for the wall tariff or no tariff, the American tax payers will in the end.\n\n\n\n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "You put in that much effort to do absolutely nothing to persuade me about anything.

Every president does good things that have costs. Not everyone will agree w it, but those who do will justify those decisions by over emphasizing the benefits and understating the costs. I think u can do that with every president.\n\nAlso I'm not sure if u understand what unemployment rate is. It's a title, and it's misleading. It doesn't mean the rate of unemployed people. It's the number of people who are unemployed AND looking for a job, over those employed.
