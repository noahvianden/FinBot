You must be a fucking god -- as in not from this world, if you're able to find better opportunities than that. This is absolutely ridiculous.

However, I don't think any investor on earth is good enough to pass up on an investment they believe with a high degree of conviction will result in a 35.5% cagr. Great investors buy things too early all the time, because they see an opportunity and know they can't time the market.

HOWEVER: It may take a long time to get there, and until it does owning AMD is going to be Mr. Toad's Wild Ride.\n\n2.5k was too much for me to take along for that ride, but I can handle 1k. I think.
