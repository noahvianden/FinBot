They would buy shares to  reduce the float to drive up market price. Forcing Amazon to increase there offer a lot till they can convince shareholders to sell enough shares to make up for what walmart took, or just make a side deal with walmart to buy the shares back from them at a mark up. If walmart doesn't sell it wouldn't be greenmail, but it would be hard to picture walmart holding on to a decent stake in amazon (just picture what amazon shareholders would think of that). If they sold a huge position on the open market right after the deal they would probably take a loss.\n\nFederally it is punished with a 50% tax on any greenmail profits. On the state level though most states have laws flat out prohibiting it. In PA and Ohio a company has to turn over 100% of any greenmail profits to the state. NY prohibits a company from buying >10% of shares from anyone above market price. It's complicated and scattered because lawmakers worry about discouraging innocent buybacks meant to give profits back to normal shareholders. Even if walmart did this and somehow didn't break any laws (they very well could, it's complicated, with tons of loopholes and walmart has tons to spend on lawyers) it would be petty and attract a ton of unwanted attention on them from regulators.\n\nAlso walmart and whole foods are \"technically\" in the same industry competing for customers. If they wanted to buy whole foods it would be a drawn out process to get approval with the FTC. This would make it a little difficult for anyone to take their bids seriously. Side note: Many people don't realize this but Bezos is a complete autist. If Whole Foods told him walmart made a higher bid and tried negotiating with him after a deal was already agreed upon he would probably emit a loud screech and walk away from the deal causing whole foods share price to tumble.\n\nhttp://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2034&context=wlulr", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Walmart and whole foods are not in the same business.
