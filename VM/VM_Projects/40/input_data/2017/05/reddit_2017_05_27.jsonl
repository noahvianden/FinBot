One of his \"secrets\" was starting several small businesses as a kid and making more than most of his teachers by the time he graduated high school. Businesses included golf balls from the lake, pinball machine repair and leasing, paper route.

In terms of relevant returns, investing makes you very little on 5k. Trading offers the potential to double up real quick if you're a combination of good and lucky.

Trading with 5k will be easier if you have no commission fees than trading with 2mil because there are more opportunities open to you than the guy with more money. Also, just think about it psychologically. If a person with no net wealth but not necessarily no salary can either make 5k or lose it all, making 5k is somewhat enticing as they have very little to their name to begin with. If someone has 2mil, they can already live very comfortably. Doubling up to 4mil won't make them that much more comfortable, and losing everything will make them cry tears only a grown man would cry.\n\nPersonally, I don't like trading, however with less money, I would be inclined to take more risks on smaller, less established companies for faster growth potential.
