Resistance has been strong at $13.70 heading into Q1 ER, it's been wanting to break resistance so badly but the highly awaited ER was preventing that.\n\n2.

Vega and Naples haven't even been released yet and Ryzen hasn't had anywhere near enough time to make an impact.\nAI is the future and AMD already has that set for themselves.\n\n6. Just one hedge fund alone can make this move. Insitutional investors will not let it break-down the normal market day $11.57 resistance. Tomorrow the gap will be filled and tomorrow in my opinion it will be most likely neutral, a tug-o-war between bulls and bears. Although another over-exaggeration isn't unlikely. Breakout is coming within this month so the road to $15-16 is resumed.\n\nEdit: Spelling", "id": "68q7bp", "created_utc": 1493688528.0, "score": 19, "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "num_comments": 47, "comments": [{"body": "I have some almost-history with this stock. It was almost the first stock I ever bought back in March (but instead went with NVDA which worked out pretty well.) \n\nOne thing I paid attention to was the leadup to the Ryzen release. The sentiment was extremely bullish and everyone was expecting perfection out of it. People including on this subreddit were buying in the exact day before to 'not miss' the run. I didn't because I understood perfection was already priced in. If you remember back to then, this was before it hit its first real headwinds and there were no contrary opinions. It was hype. After it launched, some less than perfect reviews came such as from Ars Technica, and AMD took a hit. Then it bounced back. \n\nThis would strike me as a similar scenario. \n\nThe shorts want you to think \"Shit is going down now. I am going to panic and sell\". AMD has a higher than normal amount of less experienced investors who bought the hype and haven't experienced temporary 10%+ paper losses before. \n\nThey don't want you to realize that as long as there's still a ** pipeline** - ie VEGA and NAPLES- you have a corresponding pipeline of runups you can play. \n\nkdcurry and the like intentionally conflate *\"It will fall on earnings\"* (which we already should've or did in fact expect since we saw Ryzen), with* \"It will fall to $8.\"* One doesn't lead to the other. I saw this same dynamic with AUPH, which I've posted about. People with short interest will use stocktwits/reddit/twitter as a platform to advance their own position. They use one outcome for a particular news runups/selloff that they were right about to assert a second one. How do they know that the market 'priced in' an outperformance by 25%, vs 10%, vs 5%? They do not. They just want you to yoyo around with the market because they want to test your DD and your hand. \n\nThere are bulls who called the drop but are waiting to enter because they understand there is a *pipeline* of catalysts - Vega and Naples - and a corresponding pipeline of runups. There are the catalysts that are scheduled that the CNBC, analysts/market makers, pumpers will hype up and attract inflows - but there are ones that you *won't* know about or see coming. \n\nWith AUPH, there were three presentations/conferences in 3/27/2017 and 4/20/2017, and 5/2/2017. That's it. But what was NOT scheduled was Merck licensing deal, Lumira Capital and Bob Duggan buying >10% of shares outstanding between them. \n\nNow, I ask you a question:\n\nQuestion: Did you foresee the CEO locking down a deal to write off ~$200 million or whatever it was in debt? \n\nQuestion: Did you anticipate AMD being added to the S&P 500? \n\nWith a shitty company, you'll get blindsided with reverse splits, relentless stock dilution, mismanagement, lawsuits, malpractice. But with a good company, you'll get positive news that add value to the company. One reason I decided to buy back into AUPH was precisely because of future catalysts that will take you by surprise. \n\nSo my advice: Go and watch the intraday charts, 5 minute, 15 minute, to see if RSI + volume (OBV/accum/dist/MFI) start tapering off and if you see bottom formation. But RSI being at 20 doesn't mean the stock must rebound. If it's just pointed down at 45 degrees without leveling off (i.e. signs of forming a bottom), it'll just fall further. The chart, the price action, will be more objective than emotional response. \n\nBut if people want you to blindly panic sell without even *looking* at the charts, without even considering future things down the pipeline and whether there will be a better exitpoint, and use paper-thin logic \"It was all priced in\" and fear rhetoric, then you know they have ulterior motives that don't involve your best interest.
