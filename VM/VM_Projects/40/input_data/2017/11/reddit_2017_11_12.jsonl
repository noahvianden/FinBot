Sling is the only reasonable choice to keep some sport programs for him without spending a fortune to keep them on. \nTo get back to the point if Netflix is worth the stock price, No, I don't think so but I don't believe Hulu is worth much either. Even multiple people share accounts with their families and friends, there are still healthy growth of subscriptions every quarter. I don't know about Hulu if they would work as well internationally since the networks would sell individual shows to local networks. That way Hulu is pointless and no one would pay for something is on their local networks.
