Intel is number two to me because they are becoming a well balanced machine, with established personal computer, servers (think cloud computer stations) divisions, with rapidly growing artificial intelligence/automated vehicles, and memory (make memory with a technology that MU is only just now trying to recreate) divisions, and the company is also actively making the themselves more efficient. \n\nMU, like memory in general, tends to be cyclical, which is why the PE is so low for the company. There are often \"this time is different\" people out there, and with the proliferation of smart phones and connectivity of everything, this may be the case now that memory will remain in high demand, and high prices for good, but I'm not so certain. \n\nJNJ has been a solid company for decades, and a stalwart in many long-term portfolios. However, recent developments in consumer goods, and the companies shift to being more of a bio-tech/pharma company (50% of their revenues came from bio/pharma this last quarter, a record for them) causes some pause and concern for me, as their continued growth, with their consumer goods/beauty products likely stagnant for a while, in question as patents for blockbuster drugs expire. I believe that JNJ, while also very overpriced from historical PE levels, will have to bloat their balance sheet with debt via M/A to continue to have revenue growth with new drugs, or face exorbitant R/D costs, or declining revenues. \n\nDisclaimer: I am long INTC and VISA.
