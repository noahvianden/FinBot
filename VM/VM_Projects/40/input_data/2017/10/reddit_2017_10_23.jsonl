A good example is the current Intel architecture changes for the past several product codenames.\nSkylake was released in August 2015. It a complete redesign of the Intel processors that came before it, Broadwell. Kaby Lake was supposed to be a 10 nanometer chip (10nm). It was supposed to be called Cannonlake. That was the product that was supposed to succeed Skylake. Sadly, Intel sucks dick at die shrinks. They had a hard time going from 22 nanometers to 14. They've had a harder time going from 14 to 10 nm. So they improved Skylake, added a little more bullshit, and called it Kaby Lake.\nAnd what's more, Intel couldn't even figure out 10nm production this fucking year, hence the reason we have Coffee Lake chips (i7 8700K and all its lower desktop variants... server parts will launch next year or late this year). Meanwhile, AMD will be transitioning to a 7 nanometer process that Global Foundries announced in June 2017. That means AMD's Ryzen 2 will likely be on a 7 nanometer FinFET process while Intel is still fucking around trying to figure out their 10 nanometer process.\nSo what's all this shit translate into, when you talk about CPUs and performance? Global Foundries 7nm FinFET process will see a 40% increase in chip performance and a 60% decrease in power used by those chips. That translates into a host of possibilities for AMD. Smaller chips that use less power and are faster. That's a big draw for anyone in the mobile segment... laptops, tablets, etc. Its a big draw for the server market because faster chips that use less power mean you can pack more shit into a single datacenter, and on top of that, you can keep the datacenter cool for less money. On the desktop, it means you can add more cores at higher gigahertz for the same amount of power.\nSo Intel is behind the 8-ball for the first time in a long time, and frankly, they don't know how to deal with it as an organization. They've been on top for so long, they forgot what its like to actually have to work... combine this with the fact that they're not only a semiconductor designer (they design CPUs), they're also a semiconductor producer (they have their own silicon foundry where chips are actually made), and dump on top the fact that they're already 2 years behind on moving to a 10 nm process, and its a recipe for GAINZ, GAINZ, GAINZ!!, either through shorting INTC, going long on AMD, or ideally, a combination of both...\nThis is a golden opportunity for all you fuckers that want yachts...
