{"title": "Thoughts on AMD tomorrow", "selftext": "So I bought 35 shares of AMD about a month ago at  around 12.50$. I've been sitting on it and watching it slowly go up in price. It's now at 14.10 per share. Basically my question is what do you think it's going to do tomorrow since it's Q3 earnings are set to come out. I've heard quite a bit about how it's going to jump in price due to its supposedly good earnings this quarter. What do you guys think will happen? Will it drop, stay the same, or jump up and by how much?", "id": "78dugo", "created_utc": 1508824621.0, "score": 59, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 41, "comments": [{"body": "deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.8709  [^^^What ^^^is ^^^this?](https://pastebin.com/FcrFs94k/61675)", "score": 39, "replies": [{"body": "100% AMD is solid.
