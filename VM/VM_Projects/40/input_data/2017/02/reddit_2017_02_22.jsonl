{"title": "($FNMA and $FMCC) F stands for Fucked and Here’s Why", "selftext": "Imagine this, it’s late 2017, maybe August or September, Trump has just been impeached and Pence is taking over office. Luckily, you chose to hold FNMA and FMCC tomorrow because you aren’t a cuck, or are you… \n\nLet’s take a closer look. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are becoming irrelevant in modern society. Millennials just aren't purchasing homes. Instead, many young adults are already opting to live with their parents (whose homes have already been paid off long ago!), in their cars (don't get me started on subprime auto loans, SHORT! SHORT! SHORT!) , or sleep in company provided “pods”. The 2008 housing crisis was clearly the turning point in societal consciousness which spurred this cultural revolution. \n\nTechnology is changing the landscape of finance at an unimaginable rate and $TSLA is set to disrupt the way society at large views property and homes. Why commute to work at a single location when you could sleep in your self-driving car equipped with a shower, kitchen, and king sized bed. In the near future, your $TSLA will play mozart while it drives you off to a second, third, or even fourth job. In 2015, the average commute was approximately an hour a day. If autonomous cars improve this time by even 90%, that’s an additional 54 minutes of time you could spend at work! Not to mention the valuable energy consumers will save by not wasting precious time trying to find a job! When everyone can afford to have 4 or 5 jobs, unemployment will seem like a distant memory. In a few decades, our children will look back at our way of life as if we were Neanderthals, living in \"homes\" and paying \"mortgages\". Given the accelerating rate of technology, the aforementioned societal paradigm shift will be reality before you know it. With such troubled business models, it’s no surprise that institutional investors are looking to entice unsuspecting retail investors with cheap shares of FNMA and FMCC while they load up on $TSLA. Like fiat currency, there is no real value left in the mortgage industry. Don’t be confused by claims that Mnuchin will change anything. Mortgages are done. Securities are done. Mortgage backed securities are done.\n\n\n**\nTLDR?
