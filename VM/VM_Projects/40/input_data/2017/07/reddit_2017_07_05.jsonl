{"title": "$NVDA bullish swing play setup", "selftext": "[Chart](http://i.imgur.com/74Vd1wr.png)\n\n*Note: this setup only applies if close above 142.*\n\nNVDA might be setting up for an upward move on the swing timeframe. Although we are halfway between SMA20 and SMA50, yesterday we came pretty close to SMA50 and today we have an upward move.\n\nThe current pattern, if today holds, is a [bullish harami](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bullishharami.asp). These are rare patterns with decent winrates.\n\nThe past few days we tried to test the 147 level for support but failed. Because 147 failed as support, the likelihood of 140 holding support increased.\n\nDaily RSI yesterday was 42. That's the lowest it's been since April.\n\nIf you get in today at 142.50, and set a stop below today's low at about 141, you have a positive reward:risk ratio. If you take 147 as implied resistance, and set your first target at 146, it's a 3.50 upward move vs 1.50 downward risk. It's over 2:1; you only need to be right 33% of the time here to have a small winner in the next few trading days. Combine that with these other bullish reasons and it's a trade worth taking.", "id": "6lf81w", "created_utc": 1499273176.0, "score": 126, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 45, "comments": [{"body": "bullish harambe", "score": 98, "replies": [{"body": "bullish harem bae", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "bullish hammurabi ", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "This is the kind of apt analysis we need", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Nigga solid DD.
