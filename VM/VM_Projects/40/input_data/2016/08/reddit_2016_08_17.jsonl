An FDA-designated Breakthrough Therapy, AndexXa is in development for patients treated with a direct (apixaban, rivaroxaban, or edoxaban) or indirect (enoxaparin) Factor Xa inhibitor when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. Currently, there is no FDA-approved antidote for Factor Xa inhibitors.\n\n\nIn the CRL for AndexXa, the FDA requested that Portola provide additional information primarily related to manufacturing. The agency also asked for additional data to support inclusion of edoxaban and enoxaparin in the label, and indicated it needs to finalize its review of the clinical amendments to Portola’s post-marketing commitments that recently were submitted.\n\n“Because AndexXa addresses an urgent unmet medical need, we and the FDA are committed to resolving the outstanding questions and determining appropriate next steps. Portola’s goal is to define the most expedient path to approval so we can meet the needs of these patients who have no alternative,” said Bill Lis, chief executive officer of Portola. “We plan to meet with the FDA as soon as possible.”\n\nNot a total disaster, but not great either.
