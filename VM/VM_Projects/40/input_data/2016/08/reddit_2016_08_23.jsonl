They are literally contracts that you can buy or sell. The ones on the left are \"Call\" contracts, on the right are \"Put\" contracts.\n\nCalls give the buyer the right to purchase the stocks at the predetermined price (5.5, 6.0, 7.0, etc, aka the \"strike price\") by the expiration date. For example, you could purchase one contract for the $6.0 calls for January 2017. The current asking price is $2.25.\n\nSo $2.25 x 100 (100 shares per contract) = $225 to buy this contract.\n\nNow you have the right to buy 100 shares at $6.\n\nSo if January rolls around and AMD is trading at like $20 a share, you would have a very valuable option because you can exercise your contract and purchase 100 shares at only $6 each. That would be $600 and you could just immediately sell them for $100x$20 = $2000. Congrats. Or you could just sell the contract because at that point it would be worth a lot more than just $2.25", "score": 24, "replies": [{"body": "So the cost of $6 ($2.14)call is much higher because the % chance of being able to reap benefits by striking at 6$ is pretty high, compared to the $9 ($0.8) calls. So is the BID price, simply the cost of the contract to be able to buy the stock for 6$? Essentially costing me $8.14 per share, assuming I buy 6$ calls at $2.14 contracts? And if I bought $9 calls at $0.8, whenever I chose to execute the call, regardless of the actual current price of the stock, I would be paying in total $9.80 per share, correct?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Wait first of all bid/ask is basically the selling price / buying price\n\nBid = price you can sell something for\n\nAsk = price you can buy something for\n\nSo we're going to be looking at the asking price here because we're buying calls in this example.\n\nYou've got the basic concept right, the price of the $9 calls are cheaper because of the risk/probability. But as far as the way they come up with the prices of the contracts, it is a bit more complicated. But buying the $6 calls at ~~$2.14~~ $2.25 per contract does not equate to \"$8.25 per share\"... \n\nThe ability to purchase a stock that is currently priced at $7.70 for only $6.00 has some value. It has an intrinsic value of $1.70 so the contracts are going to be at LEAST $1.70 each. Anything on top of that is related to investors outlook on the stock, and is called the premium.\n\nPremium = $2.25 ask - $1.70 intrinsic value = $0.55\n\nSo you're going to be paying $0.55 x 100 = $55 fifty-five bucks is the premium to purchase one contract in this example.\n\nIn the end, your transaction could look like this (completely ignoring commissions and fees)\n\nBuy $6 call @ $2.25 = Total spent $225\n\nJanuary comes along, AMD trading at $10/share.\n\nExercise contract, purchase 100 shares at $6 = Spend $600 more (total spent now $825)\n\nSell shares immediately 100 x $10 = $1000\n\n$1000 - $825 = $175 profit\n\nOR if you didn't have the $600 in January and don't want to actually buy the shares, you could just sell the contract, which will have a MUCH higher bid price by then.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "Nice explanation.

I'm in deep in this bitch", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Ah yes, I just looked up this article because I know Seeking Alpha has had very biased articles against AMD.  It was written by Mark Hibben, and he is consistently biased against AMD.  Just check out his other articles.  I'm pretty sure he has an agenda or a short position.\n\nI'm not an expert by any means but I'm a computer enthusiast who keeps up to date with hardware news, and has a good understanding of how this stuff works.  Here's my take on his claim:\n\nAll the facts he presented in his article are on point, actually.  It's his implications that are very questionable.  They did downclock the Intel CPU to 3.0 Ghz to match the Zen CPU; but this is actually to present an apples to apples, clock for clock comparison to demonstrate Zen's vastly improved IPC (instructions per clock) over their previous chips and to show that they have reached parity with the Intel chip.  In current computing, IPC is perhaps the most important factor in determining a CPU's single threaded performance, much more so than raw clock speed.  So if you set all other factors equal (number of cores, clock speed, etc), you get the actual picture of which CPU is faster.  It's easy to increase clock speeds, but if your architecture and IPC are shit, you're stuck with that and no amount of clocking the chip higher will make it better (see current AMD FX CPUs).\n\nNow, Hibben is arguing that the demo was flawed because the Intel chip isn't performing at it's default potential (6900K has an actual clock of 3.2 Ghz and a turbo of 3.7 Ghz).  However, based on what I explained above, for IPC comparison's sake, it's actually EXACTLY the right thing to do.  I suspect 3.0 Ghz was chosen because it's a round number, and Zen's clock speed is still being tweaked.  Upon release, there will be multiple Zen CPUs and they will all vary in clock speed.  There's no way in hell AMD won't be able to clock them above 3.0 Ghz.\n\nTL;DR I wouldn't worry too much, the article you read was written by an author who (EDIT) should know what he's talking about given his credentials but seems to be spouting biased shit instead.", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "also its smart to not show your hand right away (the true clockspeed at launch).
