That said, I have a view that some people are a little too \"fanboy first, investor second\" when it comes to Tesla and have no ability to question anything from the standpoint of their continual response seems to be, \"Well, Elon must have a plan!\" From the posts on here and r/investing from Tesla bulls, Elon can do no wrong and there is no risk or concern about anything in regards to Tesla whatsoever. Anything that Elon has ever promised will happen and if it doesn't, Elon must have a good reason for it not to have happened. \n\nThe Solar City purchase is a complete bailout, but people parrot the \"he's building an energy company!\" line. And I'm sure, Solar City, the company whose shares he owns a significant amount of and which have been put up to secure credit lines to buy more shares, was absolutely the only option in the space. \"In addition to the bond purchases, he has taken out $475 million in personal credit lines, buying shares of SolarCity and Tesla when they needed capital, securities filings show.\n\nThe credit lines are secured with about $2.51 billion of Mr. Musk’s shares in SolarCity and Tesla, based on their closing prices Wednesday.\" (http://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-supports-his-business-empire-with-unusual-financial-moves-1461781962) Was there a point where SCTY shares would fall enough to cause a problem with the collateral he put up for the credit lines? Putting shares up to secure lines of credit to buy more shares can lead to forced selling if a situation happens - including if there was a major decline in the broader market.\n\nAnyways...I'm not against Tesla or Musk, aside from a few issues like the one noted above. To me, it's more the idea of watching people who - and not directed this towards you, more the broad r/stocks and r/investing community - who are clearly putting fanboyism and their worship of Musk above all else when it comes to looking at Tesla from an investment standpoint. People keep going, \"Oh you guys must be short!\" No, we're more just annoyed by a dozen threads a day (thankfully less lately) about it from fanboys who own it or want to own it (\"ohmagerd guys, should I buy TSLA or what?\") People posting things like \"Elon will save the world\" and generally being full-on, \"Elon poster on their wall\"-level fanboys.\n\nSomeone else just posted in this thread, even: \"So, people want to buy TSLA, likely because they want to own a piece something they love.\" Exactly. People who don't care about valuation or anything else but their love for Elon who can do no wrong in their eyes. That's certainly not everyone invested in TSLA by any means, but it sure seems to be a fairly sizable % of the TSLA population.\n\nRon Baron has been an excellent investor over the long-term, but it has not been a particularly great last 3-4 years or so. I can suggest a number of funds that have outperformed Baron's BPTRX with less volatility in the last 5 years, such as Akre Focus (AKREX). Hennessy Focus (HFCSX), Akre's former fund, has beaten BPTRX over the 10 year period in terms of total return and in terms of 1YR/3YR/5YR, both funds have outperformed BPTRX with less volatility and unlike BPTRX, neither use leverage. Both AKREX and HFCSX are mid-cap growth funds, so the comparison to the mid-cap growth BPTRX is not out of line. Principal Midcap (PMCPX) is another comparable fund I'd rather be in than Baron's Baron Partners.\n\nI know Baron discusses the long-haul, but when underperformance (or even middling performance in comparison to the category) starts to drag out towards 3-4-5 years, people start looking elsewhere. The use of leverage by Baron Partners can also serve to emphasize hot/cold periods; when that fund does well it does very well when it doesn't, it's towards the back of the back, as it is this year.\n\nIn terms of the discussion of, \"a lot of major investors being in something\", I'm sure there are many other major investors in Tesla. A lot of major investors being in something is not something that I base decisions on, as they're not always right. A lot of very intelligent people were in Valeant. David Einhorn rode Solar City all the way into the ground as that cratered. \"Do you know who Ron Baron is?\" Yeah, I do - a very good manager (at least over the long-term) who is not right 100% of the time, either. Not saying he won't be on Tesla, but the view that \n\"(fill in the blank) name manager owns it!\" doesn't guarantee anything. \n\nThat's all.", "score": 2, "replies": []}]}]}]}]}, {"body": "im not shorting tesla.  \n  \nokay, explain to me the calculations you have done that justify a 30b fair valuation. furthermore, explain to me why TSLA is undervalued. explain to me where you see revenues in 10 years.

Tesla is not an auto stock. Tesla's goal is become a massive energy conglomerate that happens to make cars as a part of its sustainable energy product ecosystem. Hence, the attempted acquisition of Solar City, market leader in the US:\n\nhttps://www.technologyreview.com/s/600770/10-breakthrough-technologies-2016-solarcitys-gigafactory/\n\n\"Last October, SolarCity announced that test panels made at a small facility in Fremont, California, had tested at just over 22 percent efficiency. Today’s commodity silicon-based solar panels have efficiencies of between 16 and 18 percent. SolarCity competitor SunPower previously led the market with cells that can reach 21.5 percent.\"\n\nhttp://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_juice/2015/07/solarcity_the_company_didn_t_invent_the_solar_panel_but_it_invented_something.html\n\n\"(SolarCity) has made a series of deals with the Defense Department to put solar panels on large clusters of military housing: 6,500 homes in Hawaii, and 6,000 homes on installations in the San Diego area. In California, its largest market, SolarCity has built a network of 40 warehouses, which serve as efficient distribution and staging areas for single-home projects. And in an attempt at vertical integration, last year it purchased solar panel manufacturer Silevo.\"\n\nhttp://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solarcity-just-acquired-silevo-and-became-a-solar-manufacturer\n\n\"It’s no secret that SolarCity sees vertical integration as the fastest way to lower the cost of solar energy. But the company wants to go deeper than any other competitor by potentially adding power electronics and battery storage into its production strategy.\n\nLyndon Rive hinted at future acquisitions of inverter suppliers and a strategy to add storage into the production facility. “Anything that will reduce our total installed cost, we will be interested in acquiring,” he said.\"\n\nNow why is this all important?\n\nhttp://www.fastcompany.com/3052889/elon-musk-powers-up-inside-teslas-5-billion-gigafactory\n\n\"(Musk's) electric-­car manufacturer is launching a new product line: large batteries that store energy in homes and even larger batteries that do the same for utilities and businesses. The Powerwall, a slender appliance designed to be mounted in your garage, comes in five colors and starts at $3,000; the Powerpack, an 8-foot-tall steel box that looks a bit like a utility transformer, is aimed at the energy industry and costs roughly $25,000. These prices are roughly half of what competing battery manufacturers charge.\"\n\n\"Musk sees his foray into home batteries as an inevitable extension of Tesla’s mission—and a necessary response to the basic facts of alternative energy in the United States. Solar power accounts for less than 1% of our total electric production in part because it has a significant limitation. As Musk puts it archly, \"The sun doesn’t shine at night.\" Starting in the late afternoon, when a typical household is using a lot of electricity to run air conditioners, televisions, computers, and maybe the oven, the energy production of a solar panel plummets, falling to zero by sunset.\n\nThis gave Musk an idea: Why not just use the same batteries that power Tesla cars in people’s homes? People could charge the batteries when the sun shines brightest and then use them at night to drastically reduce their dependence on their energy company. \"It’s pretty obvious really,\" Musk says. \"In fact, that’s what my 9-year-old said: ‘It’s soooo obvious! Why is that even a thing?’ \"\"\n\nI could go on and on about the master plan but there is a lot of information here for you to start with. So if you want to make a projection of Tesla's profits over the next few decades, good luck because it could go in many ways. But to bet against the Apple of solar would be pretty dumb in my opinion because 1.) people clearly want electric vehicles 2.) people and many politicians realize that fossil fuels are obviously not the long term solution and 3.) Tesla is building the framework that enables these changes to occur way before its competitors would even start to tackle some of these problems\n\n\n\n", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Good research, however your fatal flaw is believing the Elon hype train at face value.
