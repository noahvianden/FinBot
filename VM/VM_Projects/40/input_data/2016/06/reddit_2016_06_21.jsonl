{"title": "Wal-Mart is arguably undervalued", "selftext": "I've spent a good amount of time going through Wal-Mart SEC filings the past several days. I know you guys don't like reading a wall of serious research so I'll keep it short and sweet. \n\nCompany has plenty of cash and cash equivalents. They have a favorable debt position. Increasing investments in property and equipment. Their cash flow from operations is solid and they don't need to rely on financing cash flows to pay the bills. Solid dividend and they have pretty expansive geographic coverage. \n\nNow here's why I think this is all important. Wal-Mart took a shit a little while back, shareholders lost money and everyone is like oh no muhh cash. Perfect,   they are so cheap right now it isn't even funny. A P/E ratio below 16, compare that to Amazons 560+ P/E. We all know Wal-Mart is not Amazon, obviously, but it doesn't take a genius to figure out they already took a hit from seemingly like they were behind and Amazon is their largest (albeit different) competitor.\n\nWal-Mart is poised to have tremendous gains from the adaptation of smart technology. Increasing use of automation has the potential to streamline their processes and increase their efficiency overall with of course large upfront costs. They are in a position where pursuing this is a necessity, especially with Amazon looming on the corner swinging it's dick at Wal-Mart shareholders. \n\nNow you could argue that Amazons P/E ratio reflects all the benefits from rapid expansion of automation and technology, at this point it seems that Wal-Mart's does not. This is where they are undervalued. \n\nPersonally with upcoming automation and technological improvements I'm seeking out areas that will benefit from this the most given that I'll probably be out of a job in 25 years and nobody can rely on UBI being feasible or implemented. I think Wal-Mart is at a point where it is cheap, and it can really take advantage of automation since it already has expansive distribution and other facilities. The ground work is there and I bet my ass they are moving towards utilizing their current networks and improving them with automation. \n\nPersonally I want a piece of the automation pie. This is just one of many avenues I am taking to get their. Make your own choice, but I'll bet Wal-Mart will be above  $100/share by the end of Q1 next year. \n\nTL;DR: if this wasn't short enough for you, Wal-Mart will be above $100/share in less than a year.", "id": "4p4w3d", "created_utc": 1466519562.0, "score": 22, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 45, "comments": [{"body": "Walmart is hampered by two major strategic threats, its supply chain is not as efficient compared to the alternative models.

No fast gains here (if any gains at all).\n\nOh definitely. And this is has very speculative components, the catalyst is the advance in tech and automation that is undoubtedly on the horizon. \n\nI understand it doesn't lead to revenue creation, but Wal-Mart has adequate revenue generation as it stands. Personally I don't think brick and mortar is entirely dead, online retailers are edging in a greater market share that's also undeniable. Wal-Mart as a company is in a position where it would only benefit through adopting automated tech and plowing cash into research of that or supporting smaller firms that will. \n\nThis is my hypothesis for why Wal-Mart is undervalued. They already took the hit on their value from the threats of efficient delivery services and online retailers. Yet they are still in a great financial position, a position that has few obstacles for pursuing automation tech. \n\nYes it is speculation saying Wal-Mart will pursue automation extensively but it makes logistical sense. They have always sought out tech that brings out efficiency and they've even stated they have an interest in automation and other helper like software and equipment. \n\nOne thing that sets physical retail apart from online retail is the ability to sell a product readily on demand. Sure Amazon can bring 2 day delivery or rapid delivery but it's definitely more expensive than heading down to Wal-Mart to get the same product. This is Wal-Mart's advantage, automation has the potential to reduce their costs overall (after upfront investment costs). They can improve their margins this way and have every reason to. From there it is entirely plausible they could cut prices even further and drag more consumers from competitors. \n\nEverything is about competitive advantage. Amazon is after their market share. Wal-Mart does lose sales to online retailers but they still have increased revenue generation. They do have certain advantages over Amazon and automation can only increase those advantages. Of course Amazon benefits from these as well. \n\nI just don't think Amazon can entirely take Wal-Mart's market share for reasons I touched on briefly.
