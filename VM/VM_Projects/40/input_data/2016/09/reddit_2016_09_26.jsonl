I just want to get it done, I don't even care I'm just ready to make some money $$$. If I think Hillary is going to drop out tomorrow, what stocks/etf should I trade? I'm only going to short, because I'm just so hyped up from watching The Big Short. I was thinking about shorting the s&p 500, would this be a good idea? I'm predicting a big bubble and a market crash after this because some of the securities might be overvalued. So yea, I want to short something big like oil or gold, not just an individual stock.
