{"title": "PSA - how pump & dumps really work", "selftext": "Just a little story to give some of you an idea how stocks are pumped. Seven years ago on vacation in Cayman I met a guy whose job was to be a penny stock pumper. I was staying with his family so I got to talk to him a lot about it, and he gave me a lot of background info.\n\nBasically he would specialize in a specific industry - in his case, gold and rare-earth mining (always in a volatile industry where \"discoveries\" are important, another common one was biotech). He would have small companies as clients, who would pay him in options only, as employee compensation, and he was somehow obligated to hold them a certain amount of time. This was synched up to a schedule of when the company owners were selling their stock, so that he could pump it before they sold. This way they weren't just pumping it up to a certain point then selling all at once, and did all their pumping under pseudonyms. They never had it in writing that he synched it with their selling, it was just assumed. He lived in Cayman b/c he was Canadian and didn't have to pay cap. gains on his income there, he made like 250K/yr for a while and was saving a ton of it (I saw his bank statements). He saved over a million bucks, but then lost almost half of it in the 2008 crash.\n\nHe was pretty good at what he did - think about it, if someone came on here with enough industry and company specific knowledge and was \"helping\" you by giving you his analysis, a lot of people would have no way of detecting his affiliation with the company. Same thing for other sites - you make posts on Seeking Alpha, run your own blog, cross-post on a half-dozen other forums, and suddenly you look like an analyst rather than a pumper. Your own actions pump and drop a stock price so you look like a prescient analyst. You tell people to get out right after you and the CEO do so you get more people to follow you and support your next pump. \n  \n\n*tl;dr all in $TBEV*", "id": "3kfo9f", "created_utc": 1441909231.0, "score": 58, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 33, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "If I was shorting, i'd be much closer.

They pumped and dumped on the Vancouver Stock Exchange about 20 years ago.\n\nThere was about a dozen people, and a couple of \"marketers\" that would go to sites and start pumping penny stocks.

Of course, the people in on it already bought a shit load of the stock before hand.  Then, as the guy started to market the stock, they would start buying and selling to each other, until they had enough actual losers who thought \"maybe I'll throw a few thousand into it\", and they would buy their shares.
