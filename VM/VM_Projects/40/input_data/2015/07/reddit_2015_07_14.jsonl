I want to devour as much information as possible.  I've purchased some books, I've read a lot of articles, but some of this stuff still doesn't really click.\n\nSome of these things like options/calls/puts make my eyes cross and I just can't connect the dots.\n\nI currently have a Fidelity account.  I have some shares in Apple (don't get me started on that shit, I apparently have an uncanny ability to choose stocks at the highest price), and I have my old 401k.  Those I'd like to possibly keep separate from what I do here.\n\nI have no problem losing money **but only if I learn something from it**.  When I was 18 I lost $5,000 because I thought I was hot shit.  Turns out I'm just cold diarrhea.\n\nI started going through the \"Options Lessons for post-beginners\" but I'd really like something that maybe breaks it down to just a little bit of a more simple level.  Is there a good, free, browser-based market simulator out there?\n\nSorry if this is scatter-brained, but you folks seem to be the most down to earth and like minded people that I can ask.
