I do too. One of the major reasons for this is that financials are going to see a huge increase in quality come 2017. By then, Netflix will have expanded to all, or almost all, of the markets it plans to enter. So, though revenue is already pretty high, more of that revenue will be considered profit, rather than money to reinvest in expansion. When more of the revenue becomes profit (aka earnings), one of two things will happen, or both of these scenarios will play out over time: 1) NFLX earnings reports will surpass analyst expectations and the stock price will jump due to market hype. 2) NFLX shares will transition from \"prospective\" to \"value\" stocks, perhaps even yielding dividends in some years' time. \n\nSome related thoughts on NFLX: Though P/E is pretty high on NFLX shares, and this usually - perhaps always - indicates a stock is priced heavily on hype/future value, I believe the company is taking the right steps to meeting this prospective value and even surpassing it. It has built a strong brand and is in a market in which competitors don't really threaten its continued profitability. If you'll accept a personal example as telling of a wider-spread reality, then consider this:                \nI have subscriptions to HBO Go and Amazon Prime Video. I still pay for and use Netflix monthly.             \n\nRecent downtrends in the stock were linked to the actions of rivals (Hulu began some premium service, blah blah blah). Who cares? Netflix has the strongest brand in its market, and the purchase of rivals' products does not necessitate the stoppage of Netflix service. Further telling might be my reason for adding HBO Go to my list of TV subscriptions - exclusives like GoT, Silicon Valley, etc. Netflix has identified this strength of HBO and is now producing award-winning exclusives of its own. As these gain in popularity and in number, Netflix will add the gotta-have-it factor HBO enjoys, to its own arsenal. I don't see NFLX going down in value, and I'm confident it will in fact, increase in value for years to come. If I had more money to invest, it would be in NFLX. As it is, I'm happy NFLX stock is a significant percentage of my portfolio.
