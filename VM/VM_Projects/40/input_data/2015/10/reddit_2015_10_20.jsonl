Buyers of call options have the right to purchase stock at a given price, the strike price. These contracts are obviously very sensitive to how TSLA's price moves, because as it rises, your calls are more valuable. (They are also susceptible to interest rates, expectations of volatility, etc.) But long story short, the October 23 calls struck at 207.50 that he purchased have a ton of leverage (gamma) embedded into them. This is because if TSLA closes below 207.50, those options are worth nothing on Friday, but if TSLA closes above 207.50, they are worth however much TSLA is above 207.50. So as TSLA moves around 207.50, the value of these options will fluctuate greatly. For every day that goes by, the expected range that TSLA can trade by Friday in decreases, and the value of the calls also drops. Essentially, he bought the calls when they were cheap and they rose in value significantly because of their embedded leverage (short-dated options have more gamma) as TSLA rallied a little bit off its lows.
