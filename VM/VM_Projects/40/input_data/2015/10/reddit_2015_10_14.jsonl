Analysts, according to Thomson Reuters, have anticipated $4.73 in per-share profit for fiscal 2017, higher than the $4.54 expected for 2016.\n \n> “Fiscal year 2017 will represent our heaviest investment period,” said Charles Holley, Wal-Mart’s Chief Financial Officer. Operating income will be affected by previously announced investments, Mr. Holley said. Those investments include about $1.1 billion in e-commerce and digital initiatives.\n \n> By fiscal 2019, Wal-Mart said it expects earnings per share to rise 5% to 10%. Separately on Wednesday, Wal-Mart said its board approved a new $20 billion share repurchase program, replacing the $8.6 billion remaining on its program authorized in 2013.\n \n> In August, the retailer warned its profits would suffer this year as it steps up spending amid increasing competition. The company’s investments on behalf of customers have crimped profits but helped reverse a sales slump: Sales at U.S. stores open for at least a year rose 1.5% in the most recent quarter, the fourth quarterly increase after a long period of decline.\n\n**http://i.imgur.com/tbapTi8.jpg**", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "Why would the strong dollar hurt WMT?
