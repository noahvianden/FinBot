{"title": "Tesla discussion", "selftext": "Hello everyone, I wanted to bring up something that a lot of people don't really discuss about companies. People talk about price technicals, p/e ratios, gross margins etc. But those things only impact the quarterly results and short term price movement. But what is a big driver of the long term trajectory of a company? Vision + culture. \n\nThe reason I'm bullish about tesla in the long term is because I like their energy+ autonomy vision and they have a culture to disrupt. Tesla is full of brilliant people who work extremely hard. Now ofc, hardwork does not always yield results, you have to be working on the right things and working smart thats why I said you also need vision. Over long periods of time vision + culture = disruption. Over the short term I have no idea what tesla will do, but in the long term I believe tesla has all the ingredients to be making some of the most disruptive products/services in society in the next 5-10 years and therefore will be the largest company in the world. \n\n", "id": "1b84mad", "created_utc": 1709743919.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 52, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | 1 month ago\n**Total Comments** | 4 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It was all good until x", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "The problem is that ketamine has a known side effect of damaging your vision", "score": 44, "replies": []}, {"body": "The problem is Musk has his attention in so many other things, TESLA is not his priority these days, so I am not sure what Tesla will do long term.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "And the fact that he is begging US politician to put more protective measure up against Chinese EVs is not a good look.
