I wish I could cite it for you.

This sector is viewed as a source of national pride and serves as a cornerstone of Taiwan's economy. In contrast, the United States offers a wider variety of career options for skilled engineers.\n\nSecondly, there's a significant difference in workforce compensation between the two countries. Engineers in Taiwan generally receive lower salaries compared to their American counterparts. This salary disparity creates a challenging situation for U.S. companies like Intel, as they must compete against Taiwanese firms that have access to a highly skilled yet more affordable workforce.\n\nThe issue isn't a lack of talent in the U.S. Rather, many capable American engineers choose to work for companies like NVIDIA instead of traditional semiconductor manufacturers like Intel, likely due to better compensation or more diverse opportunities.\n\nIn essence, the combination of Taiwan's focused talent pool and lower labor costs gives their semiconductor industry a competitive edge over U.S. companies in this sector.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Wow, what an amazing response.

Cutting edge node capacity is very expensive and there is very little to share. It‚Äôs not like Nvidia can just say ‚Äúhey reserve me 1000 wafers a week Incase I want to fab with you‚Äù. They would buy up what is called swim lane capacity. Imagine your foundry has 10k wafer starts per week capacity. Company A might want to buy 5k of capacity. Company B might buy up 3, company C and D buy up 500 each and the remaining 1000 WSPW is split to small companies doing limited runs, maybe 50 wafers per week. Nvidia couldn‚Äôt jump in and say ‚Äúoh I need 5k capacity now so screw everyone else‚Äù. That can‚Äôt be done. There are contracts, etc. so they would most likely buy up some capacity from the start and leave some products running on it that could be switched to different products if needed. So for example have multiple different architecture designs. Contract with Intel to build 2 of them but keep your flagship Blackwell with TSMC. However if TSMC goes offline in the event of war, material disaster, or Nvidia just needs more chips, they can swap out capacity to another product. So for another example Nvidia has 1000 wspw contract. 100% of that is going to the 6090 GPU chip.
