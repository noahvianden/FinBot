I‚Äôll share my indicator stack and my favorite setups at the end but I first will share something I think is far more important: Home Court Advantage\n\nI only trade in market conditions where I have ‚Äúhome court advantage‚Äù. Everyone trades better in certain market conditions and worse in others. But MOST people don‚Äôt think about identifying which conditions they‚Äôre better in. So they‚Äôve been training to be professional snipers and don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre trading in a close-range gang shoot out.\n\nDon‚Äôt be someone who trades every week of the year and expects the market to stay the same or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre good enough‚Äù to consistently win in all conditions. Every successful professional trader I know specializes. Maybe it‚Äôs only day trading SPX first 30-60 minutes of the day, or only trading one sector, or only trading when VIX gets above a certain level. \n\nSo my main home court is pre-earnings season. About 1 month prior to the big tech earnings season. this means I only trade about 4-6 months a year. Sometimes I skip a season too. A perfect cadence for swing trading and trade/life balance.\n\nWhy this season for me? I find that earnings are the only medium term, consistent event in stocks we can count on happening at a regular cadence. That is a very rare characteristic to have when operating in a random market. Nothing in the markets are predictable, except we KNOW earnings will bring about high volatility and attention. And the month leading up to that is always going from lower vol to higher vol conditions. This is the sweet spot I‚Äôve found myself performing best in\n\nFind your home court. \n\nMy indicator stack is simple:\n\n- 20, 50, 200 SMA\n- TTM Squeeze indicator\n- Volume profile\n- RSI\n- MACD\n\nAgain, I believe every indicator is just a tool and one is not better than another. They‚Äôre just better for different conditions and trading styles\n\nSetups:\n\n- I like to enter trades during a time of sideways consolidation. This is identified by the Squeeze indicator. When a stock is ‚Äúsqueezing‚Äù sideways on multiple time frames, it‚Äôs even better. The longer the squeeze, the larger the subsequent move. The direction I take depends on my assessment of the trend and market conditions. During pre-earnings periods, it‚Äôs usually going long these days.\n\n- Fallen Angels. Finding Stocks in a LTF downward trend that for some reason gap DOWN again in total capitulation. I then wait for these to go sideways for months, and everyone has dumped in total panic and despair. They‚Äôve forgotten about it. And then wait for the SMA‚Äôs and volume to give me a trigger to enter near the bottom and set a stop loss below the All time low. Also monitor if insiders begin to buy. \n\n- short term, basic reversal trades at key resistance or support areas. For example if a stock or index hits its 50 month or 200 week moving averages with speed. That‚Äôs usually an easy put I can sell for a relatively quick win. (Not buying calls, I‚Äôd stick to selling puts for something like that)\n\nOr another example would be shorting stocks in the same sector where several tickets are all hitting SMA resistances like AMD and NVDA did August 1st. These are MEANT to be base hits. Sometimes it‚Äôs a home run outta no where like my Aug 1st NVDA trade but normally I just expect like a 10-20% gain\n\nThat‚Äôs about it. It‚Äôs pretty boring and simple with complexities due to my personal style. \n\nI mentor a few folks as a side gig (nothing extravagant) and usually when I try to teach them my style, it doesn‚Äôt work. But it at least gives them a framework to work off of. Long term, I‚Äôm just helping them get smaller, simpler, and more specialized in their trading.
