{"title": "BYD sales hit a record in August despite broader China EV slowdown ", "selftext": "Chinese electric car giant BYD sold a record number of passenger vehicles in August, with sales of hybrids growing faster than those of battery-only cars.\n\nThe company said August sales rose by 30% year-on-year to 370,854 passenger cars.\n\nIts sales of battery-only cars rose by nearly 12%, while hybrid-powered vehicle sales surged by 48% to account for just under two-thirds of BYD cars sold last month.\n\nIn contrast, several new energy vehicle startups saw a dip in deliveries last month.\n\nLi Auto, best known for its range-extender vehicles, reported 48,122 deliveries in August, down from a record 51,000 in July.\n\nAito, which uses Huawei technology, said it delivered 31,216 cars last month, down by more than 10,000 vehicles from the prior month. Huawei is selling the Aito trademark and patents to automaker Seres for 2.5 billion yuan ($352.5 million).\n\nLower-priced cars hitting the market\n\nNio said it delivered 20,176 cars in August, down slightly from July but above 20,000 for a fourth-straight month.\n\nThe company’s lower-priced brand Onvo opened 105 stores on Sunday as it prepares to begin for deliveries for its first car, the L60 SUV, this month. Nio is scheduled to report earnings on Friday.\n\nXpeng reported 14,036 car deliveries in August, its best month for the year so far.\n\nThe company said on Friday it began some deliveries of its newly launched, mass market Mona M03 electric car that sells for the equivalent of less than $20,000 in China. It was not clear whether those M03 deliveries were included in the total figure Xpeng reported.\n\nGeely-backed Zeekr reported a month-on-month increase to 18,015 deliveries in August, but that was down from 20,206 deliveries in June.\n\nUndercutting Tesla and going global\n\nZeekr on Friday said it would launch its first SUV this month with a price more than $1,400 lower than Tesla’s Model Y. The U.S.-listed Chinese company said it aims to deliver the SUV globally by the end of this year, but did not specify which countries or regions.\n\nBYD said it sold 31,451 cars overseas last month, pushing the year-to-date total to 264,869 and above the 242,765 cars it sold abroad for all of last year.\n\nIf BYD keeps up its average monthly overseas sales pace through the end of December, the company will sell just under 400,000 cars outside China this year, according to CNBC calculations.\n\nXiaomi only said it delivered more than 10,000 cars in August for a third-straight month. In mid-July, CEO Lei Jun said the company aimed to deliver 100,000 units of its SU7 electric sedan by the end of November.\n\nThat indicates Xiaomi needs to deliver an average of at least 16,000 cars a month from August to November, according to CNBC calculations of reported data.\n\nThe smartphone company began mass deliveries of the SU7 in April at a price about $4,000 less than Tesla’s Model 3.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/02/byd-sales-hit-a-record-in-august-despite-broader-china-ev-slowdown.html", "id": "1f7513x", "created_utc": 1725278563.0, "score": 126, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 60, "comments": [{"body": "Hi, you're on r/Stocks, please make sure your post is related to stocks or the stockmarket or it will most likely get removed as being off-topic/political; feel free to edit it now and be more specific.\n\n**To everyone commenting:**  Please focus on how this affects the stock market or specific stocks or it will be removed as being off-topic/political.\n\nIf you're interested in just politics, see our wiki on [\"relevant subreddits\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and post to those Reddit communities instead without linking back here, thanks!\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There have been some attempts to start factories in the US (and Mexico) but almost every time it seems that they hinge on the Chinese companies expecting taxpayers to bend over and give them massive concessions and subsidies.

The only advantage these Chinese companies have is the government over there, gave them factories for free and they keep financing their losses.\n\nIf you hand free factories to our companies then they could skip straight to scale production and pump out cheap eVs. But here in the USA, we dont keep supporting them like they do in China (though we did give Tesla a lot). Competition will keep them from being profitable just like they are unprofitable in China. They will just go out of business anyway and tax payers will be angry. Unlike China, we actually have elections. Note that Tesla was a special case because they were the 1st movers.

I’ll share my indicator stack and my favorite setups at the end but I first will share something I think is far more important: Home Court Advantage\n\nI only trade in market conditions where I have “home court advantage”. Everyone trades better in certain market conditions and worse in others. But MOST people don’t think about identifying which conditions they’re better in. So they’ve been training to be professional snipers and don’t realize they’re trading in a close-range gang shoot out.\n\nDon’t be someone who trades every week of the year and expects the market to stay the same or “you’re good enough” to consistently win in all conditions. Every successful professional trader I know specializes. Maybe it’s only day trading SPX first 30-60 minutes of the day, or only trading one sector, or only trading when VIX gets above a certain level. \n\nSo my main home court is pre-earnings season. About 1 month prior to the big tech earnings season. this means I only trade about 4-6 months a year. Sometimes I skip a season too. A perfect cadence for swing trading and trade/life balance.\n\nWhy this season for me? I find that earnings are the only medium term, consistent event in stocks we can count on happening at a regular cadence. That is a very rare characteristic to have when operating in a random market. Nothing in the markets are predictable, except we KNOW earnings will bring about high volatility and attention. And the month leading up to that is always going from lower vol to higher vol conditions. This is the sweet spot I’ve found myself performing best in\n\nFind your home court. \n\nMy indicator stack is simple:\n\n- 20, 50, 200 SMA\n- TTM Squeeze indicator\n- Volume profile\n- RSI\n- MACD\n\nAgain, I believe every indicator is just a tool and one is not better than another. They’re just better for different conditions and trading styles\n\nSetups:\n\n- I like to enter trades during a time of sideways consolidation. This is identified by the Squeeze indicator. When a stock is “squeezing” sideways on multiple time frames, it’s even better. The longer the squeeze, the larger the subsequent move. The direction I take depends on my assessment of the trend and market conditions. During pre-earnings periods, it’s usually going long these days.\n\n- Fallen Angels. Finding Stocks in a LTF downward trend that for some reason gap DOWN again in total capitulation. I then wait for these to go sideways for months, and everyone has dumped in total panic and despair. They’ve forgotten about it. And then wait for the SMA’s and volume to give me a trigger to enter near the bottom and set a stop loss below the All time low. Also monitor if insiders begin to buy. \n\n- short term, basic reversal trades at key resistance or support areas. For example if a stock or index hits its 50 month or 200 week moving averages with speed. That’s usually an easy put I can sell for a relatively quick win. (Not buying calls, I’d stick to selling puts for something like that)\n\nOr another example would be shorting stocks in the same sector where several tickets are all hitting SMA resistances like AMD and NVDA did August 1st. These are MEANT to be base hits. Sometimes it’s a home run outta no where like my Aug 1st NVDA trade but normally I just expect like a 10-20% gain\n\nThat’s about it. It’s pretty boring and simple with complexities due to my personal style. \n\nI mentor a few folks as a side gig (nothing extravagant) and usually when I try to teach them my style, it doesn’t work. But it at least gives them a framework to work off of. Long term, I’m just helping them get smaller, simpler, and more specialized in their trading. When you get more specialized, your volume of trades lowers but the quality of your trades sky rockets\n\nBest of luck!", "score": 4, "replies": []}, {"body": "Gamble", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": "You are literally better off picking options based on pure luck than you are asking for advice from anyone here", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "should ask the magic 8 ball at this point!", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "I hear you but probably not", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "You're both good and lucky.
