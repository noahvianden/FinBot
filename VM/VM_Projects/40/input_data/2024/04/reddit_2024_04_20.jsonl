As an investor, you got to keep going through the ups and the downs. I do sell some of my CCs below my cost basis, but when I do, I am more conservative, meaning that a higher strike and lower premium. I have one LEAPS for BABA that is below cost basis. In this case, you have to use collateral for the difference in premium between the strike and the current value of the underlying (BABA). For example: my strike for the LEAPS is $90. If I chose an $80 strike for the covered call, I would need to cover the difference with $1,000 collateral. This would break down to $90 - $80 = $10. Since options are always 100 share blocks, it would be $10 x 100 = $1,000. \n\nTo answer your question, I don't really follow hard and fast rules, I just sell covered calls that are below my cost basis with extra precautions that include higher strike and a more modest premium.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "That's about the same as my \"rules\". i.e. no hard rules lol\n\nIt's definitely tricky when selling cc below your cost basis.

Is Bogle right, and it's silly to even try to beat the market? Will passive investing always win? If so, then why waste your time?\n\nI personally believe that Bogle exploited a niche that worked well. However, I believe that era is slowly coming to an end. I lean towards Mike Green's work, which basically implies that passive strategies become more and more volatile as the percentage of passive investors begins to outweigh the active investors. \n\nAfter decades of playing this game, I believe that selling options should be part of every investors repertoire. I use short puts to leg into a position; one contract at a time. It lowers your cost basis. I conversely use short calls to exit positions. If I could predict the highs and lows then I wouldn't do this at all, but, I can't. However, I would still like to be compensated for my transaction. For me it's all about lowering my cost basis...I also take it a step further. I will isolate a greek, such as vega and create a trade around that. If I like a stock and we are going into earnings...Why not buy a calendar spread (sell before the earnings event obviously)? I either make money on the long vega/long theta trade or I get assigned and own cheap insurance. I can always roll the insurance and sell some deltas and turn it into a collar if things look dicey. It's a different way of thinking, but again, I think of everything in terms of lowering my cost basis...DCA'ing into a position is a great way for the average investor to achieve an average cost basis over time, but if you are alert then you can do much better using options IMHO...\n\nI'm very glad to hear that your collateral is cash...Sorry, I must have misunderstood.

What is the difference between the two?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "14hammarby. You know, I almost ignored this comment/question. You show up every few months, usually hostile in your comments. Your last comment was how inefficient I am and that you were going to send me $10, or whatever, in Venmo because that would somehow be better than my investment strategy. However, I am not one to hold grudges. I can get past it if you can as well. That being said, I don't mind having a civil conversation and answering questions if we just agree that the beef is squashed. My posts are about learning options, being positive, and encouraging one another. Not tearing down their approach. \n\nOn to the questions: \n\nThe difference between the middle column and the column on the right is realized vs. unrealized.\n\nThe $802 is realized gains from selling options (middle column of my posted screen shot). For example, if I sell a covered call on AMZN and make $10 in premium, the covered call expires sometime in the future, but I get the $10 right away. It is now buying power for me to deploy on something else. I will never lose the $10 whether the option gets assigned or it expires worthless. That is why it is recognized right away and that is why I post it as realized gains, because it is exactly that. As far as the far right column, this includes the realized gains and unrealized gains. The premium is factored in, but also the unrealized gains will be in there as well. \n\nSo, for the right hand column, there are factors that don't really make sense. For example: VKTX. I purchased VKTX for $6.50 per share in November 2021. I began selling covered calls against those shares. Then it caught fire and started to rise. As such, I rolled out as much as I could, but as you can see by looking at a VKTX chart over the last year, it has gone up 198%, with a HUGE jump in mid-February. \n\nI am in at $6.50 as stated above, I sold a covered call and was able to roll to increase the strike price to $15 by rolling, but this $15 strike was blown out of the water as it is now at $63 per share. So what does this mean? It means that I profited $850. However, when you look at the position currently, it states that I am at a $4,615 loss, which shows up in the right hand column on my display. This is the amount I would have made had I not capped out my gains with a covered call. From this example, you can see that the options column can be deceiving. If I did not understand options, I would probably freak out if about the $4k unrealized loss, but it is not actually a loss at all. Bottom line, I profited $850, but my covered call shows a $4k loss. This is an unrealized potential and really means nothing in terms of actual money.\n\nThank you for the questions.
