The NAV hasn't changed, because Berkshire exchanged $10B of cash for $10B of VOO shares, so it did not gain or lose any value. So VOO still has $500B NAV. But Berkshire buying $10B worth of VOO has created upward pressure on VOO price, pushing AUM higher as VOO share price goes up, causing VOO to trade at a premium to NAV. To counteract this, authorized participants start creating new VOO shares. They do this by buying the underlying securities of VOO and selling the newly assembled VOO shares. As a result, new money flows into VOO, and the NAV of VOO also increases as the APs purchase the underlying assets. This process continues until the NAV and AUM are equal again, say, once VOO reaches $510B NAV. So $10B of money flowed into VOO as as result of Berkshire purchasing $10B of VOO shares.\n\nBut look!
