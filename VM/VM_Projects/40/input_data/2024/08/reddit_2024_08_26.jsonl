{"title": "Earnings reports related to NVDA...", "selftext": "Let me qualify this by saying...I'm just an idiot who got lucky and knows very smart people who give me very good advice...but I also spend a lot of time trying to educate myself. I listened to and read the earnings of as many companies related to NVDA as I could. Mostly the Mag 7, minus AAPL as there's not much there.\n\nALPHABET- They spoke about their need for GPUs in their earning, how there is a far greater risk in underspending than overspending, but even more telling is a since deleted YT video in which former Google CEO Erik Schmidt spoke about a conversation with Sam Altman in which they agreed all the hyper scalers alone, JUST these 4 companies...would be spending 300 BILLION in the next 3-4 years at least to stay competitive...and 95% of that GPU spend will be going to...NVDA.\n\n[https://invezz.com/news/2024/08/26/nvidia-stock-could-soar-after-august-28-and-google-could-be-the-reason/](https://invezz.com/news/2024/08/26/nvidia-stock-could-soar-after-august-28-and-google-could-be-the-reason/)\n\nTSLA-Musk obviously sung the praises of NVDA and is using his chips for a multitude of things. This may be the least consequential of the \"MAG 7\" companies that uses NVDA(AAPL doesn't use them).  \n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-were-using-a-lot-of-nvidia-hardware-174620935.html?fr=sycsrp\\_catchall](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-were-using-a-lot-of-nvidia-hardware-174620935.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall)\n\nMETA- Zuckerberg and Jensen had their little fireside chat at the SIGGRAPH conference, Meta is spending billions and increasing their AI spending.\n\nAMZN-This was a particularly interesting earnings. They also spoke about AWS and cloud growth (where they beat on) and how 90% of data servers are on size and if you anticipate...\"as most do\" that the number will invert in the future, that will tell you how much they'll be spending on their AI CapEx in the future. So they're 10% in on their CURRENT build out.\n\nMSFT-Again, increasing CapEx on AI.\n\nTSMC-This one MIGHT hurt NVDA a tiny bit, but it's going to help it a HELLUVA lot more. They're growing, revenues, and it's long been speculated that they will raise costs because they've got a monopoly(effectively). So they're producing more, and NVDA is a larger percentage of their business. From 44% up to 52%.\n\nThat's before we get into SMCI, the H20 that conforms to the export requirements for China, and new partnerships that will invariably develop(or the ones that already exist that are smaller but important parts of the business.\n\nThis DOESN'T MEAN NVDA WILL GO UP. 'Short-term voting, long-term weighing,' etc..\n\nNVDA also can't just beat earnings. If it comes in at 29B, same margins and guides for 31B next Q, it's going to drop...a lot(probably \\~20-25%). Long-term guidance could mitigate that, but just meeting is bad earnings for a company with NVDA's expectations and growth.\n\nI think they'll hit 30B+(I have 31B from Q2, guide for 34(they're always conservative)...and then I think Q4 '25 and Q1 '26, we could see 90B in revenue...but that's just a guess. Their Blackwell updates will be enormous and Huang's little presentation on ROI on their products will also help(I'm expecting then to talk about FSD\n\nThese are just my thoughts/observations. I'd advise anyone else to go back and listen to those earnings reports, and put in the time...and that should answer most questions.

Why didn’t the contract go up the 20% delta or even at all?\n\nThis is a good question. There could be a few different explanations. \n\nFirst of all, nothing goes on \"inside a contract.\" I get what you mean and it does seem as if contracts are living creatures with a mind of their own sometimes, but that's not really true. What's really going on is that *the market responds to information that impacts the future value of the contract*. That's the whole option trading game in a nutshell. Contracts are for speculating on future value. The markets will bid a price on that contract according to the market's best guess at that future value. And the market doesn't always agree with itself, it's not a monolith. Some factions may think the future value will be high while other factions think the value will be low. Which is why any given contract may have both buyers and sellers.\n\nNext, \"why didn't the contract go up?\" implies that you are observing a contract price and comparing it to some time in the past. So my question is, *which price were you observing*? There's no one price on a contract until it trades. **Price is discovered**. Until a trade happens, the market price is smeared out over a range called the bid/ask spread. The market price can be *any* price inside the spread, inclusive. So, given that spread out range of prices, *you can't always know if a price went up or down*, if the change is smaller than the spread width.\n\nIf you look only at the bids and the bids are the same, you can pretty confidently say that the contract, \"didn't go up or down.\" The bid is the floor under the market price of the contract. It is unlikely (though not impossible) for a price to be discovered under the bid. On the other end, the sky is the limit. The market price can be any value above or including the bid. The ask is just the *lowest* offer that hasn't been filled, but trades can be filled higher and often do.\n\nFinally, delta is an explanation, not a driver. If you observe that the stock went up and the call's bid went up, the amount that the call's bid went up would be attributed to delta, assuming all else was equal, like volatility and the risk-free rate. For example, the bid of this call is now $1.20 after the stock went up $1 and the call's bid used to be $1.00 and volatility didn't change, so that means delta is now .20 (ignoring theta).\n\n**TL;DR** - The market price comes first, the greeks come after. The market price is expressed as a range called the bid/ask spread. The greeks attempt to explain how the market price got to be what it is.\n\n----------\n\nOkay, now with that background covered, here are two possible explanations.\n\n1. The price didn't actually stay the same. Unless the bids were the same, the price actually changed, it just didn't appear to change or change as much as delta, because of artifacts of the bid/ask spread and the way brokers use the mark (midpoint) of the spread to do price quotes. In other words, the mark is just a *guess* and your broker might have guessed wrong.\n\n1. The bid did go up by delta, but it also went down by vega and/or theta. They sometimes work against each other and can result in no change in bid despite the stock price going up.

The broker doesn't just cover those shares by exercising the long arm? \n\nIt's hard for me to answer your question because the circumstances for the short leg to be assigned put constraints on what's going on with the stock and the long leg. The short leg would be assigned only if it has zero extrinsic value, which happens either very close to expiration, like the day of or the day before, or it is very deep ITM. If it is very deep ITM, that also means the long call has gained value and may also be ITM. The specifics of the diagonal, like the strikes and expirations, are needed to say more.\n\nBut, if I ignore all that, you should be very, very, VERY angry if a broker unilaterally exercised a long call before expiration that still had extrinsic value. That means your broker just torched that money, it's a dead loss. Since brokers aren't usually in the habit of torching client's money for no reason, it's unlikely they will exercise a call early.\n\nAssuming this is a margin account, a much more typical sequence of events would be:\n\n1. Short call is deep ITM, has no extrinsic value, is assigned. This results in you being short 100 shares.\n\n1. If you have sufficient margin buying power to meet the initial margin requirement of the short shares, that's the end of it. Nothing more happens, your long call is untouched. You just hold a short position of 100 shares.\n\n1. If you do not have sufficient margin buying power,  you are issued a margin call notice. The margin call will require that you deposit funds to cover the shortfall ASAP (I a believe a specific date will be given), or the broker will be forced to liquidate your equity to cover.\n\n1. If you don't deposit more funds or can't, your equity assets, including the long call, will be liquidated (sold to close) until the shortfall in buying power is covered.\n\n1. If that still isn't enough to cover the shortfall, your broker will buy to close the short position in shares, perhaps at a large loss to you.\n\nHowever, if the short assignment happens the day before expiration, your broker may go ahead and exercise on the day of expiration. They are more likely to exercise for you if the long call has no extrinsic value. If the long call is very deep ITM on expiration day, they may just wait for exercise-by-exception at expiration.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your clarification.

I'm trying to figure out how to get a view of my trades that match my perception of what is going on.\n\nFirst I'd like to see if my perception makes sense. Fidelity wants to present each stock and option in terms of profit and loss based on the current value. But my perception is that premiums from selling options manipulates the cost basis of the stock. As such, I see a stock/options trade based on the total profit/loss on that manipulated cost basis.\n\nAn example of three trades to illustrate. I wanted to test a covered call. So, I bought 100 shares of SIRI for $299. The accounting for these shares are simple. It shows a cost basis of $2.99. Current value is $3.16. So, it shows $17 of profit. Simple.\n\nExcept I then turned around and wrote a couple of covered calls against the stock. Last week, just dipping a toe in the water, I wrote a weekly OTM call at $3.50 for 0.03. SIRI was pretty sideways and never threatened the option. I closed for a penny earning a $2 \"profit\".\n\nNow in my head that $2 lowers the cost basis on the $299 I paid since I got $2 back. So, to me the cost basis of the stock is now $297, since if I sell it for $297, along with the $2 premium, I have $299 back and I break even.\n\nThis week I ventured into ITM options. The premiums are higher because they embed the extrinsic value of the difference between the strike and the current stock value. The weekly option for $2.50 was collecting 0.60 in premium when I wrote it. Again my view is that that $60 ($59.35 with the commission) drops the basis down to $237 (rounded). So, if the shares are called at $2.5, the $250 I would get for the shares along with the $60 premium means that I profit $11 over the $299 I paid if the shares are called away. So, to me, I'm all green.\n\nBut that's not what Fidelity shows me. First off, for the actual shares the cost basis has not moved a single penny from the $2.99 that I originally purchased the shares.\n\nAs for the option, since SIRI has shot up since I sold the call, Fidelity only shows me the P/L if I were to buy the option back right now. Well at $3.16 there is a minimum of 0.66 in extrinsic value in that option now. So, of course if I bought it back now, and it's actually at 0.71 at the moment, it would of course be a loser as I only got paid 0.60 when I sold it.\n\nNow I can do the mental math. But I am wondering if there is a view that shows the cost basis of stock + options that shows the manipulated cost basis because of the premiums ($237 in this case) and the overall P/L of the stock + the option ($310 in this case) relative to the original cost basis ($299 in this case)?\n\nBTW I fully expect to lose my shares at $2.50 and end up with $310 total for the campaign.

The call option was a separate position. The $3 you received for selling a call does not change your cost basis on the shares. You made $2 in short-term capital gains on it. If you hold the shares for more than a year and sell for a profit, you will have a long-term capital gain on those shares.\n\nThe only way option premiums affect cost basis/sale price is when you exercise or are assigned. If you exercise a call or are assigned on a short put, the premium is factored into the cost basis on the shares rather than creating a separate taxable event.

You say you want to buy LEAPS but you left out some critical information:  calls/puts and how far away from the money (in or out).\n\nNow, most of the time when I see people talk about buying LEAPS they mean deep in the money calls.  If that’s the case, here’s my take.\n\nMy first issue is liquidity. These contracts tend to have low liquidity and therefore you are subject to price slippage at both ends of your trade.  So they may not be then bargain you think they are.\n\nDeep ITM options don’t have nearly as much IV movement as something near the money and closer in time.  They have a ton of intrinsic value so as a % of the premium.  IV can affect it for sure, but not as much as something with less intrinsic value relative to the premium. An IV crush post earnings will have less of an effect on a contract that far out in time and deep ITM than, say something that expires a few days after earnings near the money.  \n\nExample:  NVDA $119 call 9/27…Vega is about 11 on $558 of risk.  $50 call Jan 2026, Vega is 14.45 but on $7,500 of risk.  So as a % of the risk, it’s tiny.  And on that $7,500 less than $500 is extrinsic value anyway.  So are you really getting a bargain based in IV?  Maybe a little but not much.\n\nWhy would you think that as the price goes up, so does the IV?  That can happen but usually IV goes down as price rises.  Now events like earnings can skew this.  IV is more about uncertainty.  People are less uncertain as things are going up than down.  Speed also matters a lot here.\n\nMy opinion is deep in the money call LEAPS most of the time don’t provide enough risk/reward to be worth it.  If you are long term bullish, just buy shares on dips.  Options have a place, but so do shares.  And for the long haul I’ll take shares over LEAPS.  Shares allow me to buy and hold over a long period of time, buying dips to lower my cost basis.

Friday ended with some bullish energy and I was anticipating that carrying over into the next market open, but Bitcoin dropping has me curious about the relationship now. I'd expect there to be a correlation due to weekend news related events influencing the market (which SPY was unable to react to, but BTC being traded 24/7 has had time), but right now there's no news and BTC is dipping.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "You could compare Graphs of prices, for a start.   Generally Inerxes push BITCOIN around. \n\n\nDeclining  indexes are associated with declining bitcoin, and rising  indexes with rising bitcoin. \n\n\nFutures on indexes trade starting Sunday evenings.

I just thought max potential returns would be higher with the OTM 0dte, and was trying to figure out the risk:reward on it.\n\nSay I have insight into the future that SPY will close at $566 on 9/3, what would be the best way to trade that? To a newbie, it sorta seems like buying an OTM 0dte at $0.01 and selling it on the uptrend offers insane reward at a low price, since if SPY moved to say $566 within the first hour, that $0.01 call could be worth $0.5 now (judging by the current prices at least). I know I must be wrong though otherwise this very basic inefficiency would be eaten up already. I don't really have any idea how to reason about prices except at expiry, otherwise I'm just using very broad intuition (i.e, underlying goes up, my calls go up -- but I have no idea how to estimate the magnitude of these moves). So reasoning about intraday contract prices before expiry is difficult.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> I just thought max potential returns would be higher with the OTM 0dte\n\nIn terms of percentage return, OTM is higher. That's because the lower the up front cost, the higher a $1 gain is as a percentage return. That's just leverage math. **But leverage cuts both ways,** so your losses will be bigger as a percentage as well. And since theta is already working against you, starting with a lower cost doesn't leave much margin for profit.\n\n> To a newbie, it sorta seems like buying an OTM 0dte at $0.01 and selling it on the uptrend offers insane reward at a low price\n\nOf course, but who cares that your percentage return is 420% if all that means is that you have a $.69 gain? Don't you care about the actual dollars gained as well? Leverage reduces the *per lot* cost, but it shouldn't reduce the total cash at risk, or else you reduce your dollar reward as well. What you're trying to do with leverage is get the highest return for constant cost. So if the comparison is one ATM call for $1000 for 2:1 leverage vs. ten OTM calls for $1000 ($100 each) for 20:1 leverage, higher leverage of the OTM calls ought to pay more in actual dollars. Again, that also means you lose more in dollars if the trade goes against you.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes of course the return in absolute terms (i.e, magnitude) is proportionate to the input. The point was more that if this is a positive EV situation one could scale it up and find a sweet spot that doesn't blow up an account but also may yield good returns. If EV is 0.40 (which was what my trailer-park-tier napkin math suggested) that'd be an annualized return of 40%, provided all assumptions, numbers and other inputs were accurate and one was betting with proper position sizing (small). Of course this would be an absurdly obvious inefficiency in the market so I'm sure I'm wrong, but I wanted to double check before 'learning the hard way' and tossing in $1-10 bucks daily on OTM 0dtes, which is begurdgignly still on the agenda for this week.\n\nI had another question though, with interest rates supposedly dropping this month shouldn't we all be looking for contracts with high Rho, or perhaps contracts with mispriced Rho? To take it further, maybe looking for companies that will now have unique opportunities due to the lowered rates? Tangentially, could confirmation of lower rates hurt any companies?

It seems like some 'experts' advise that a lot of buying at higher strikes are saying the SPY, QQQ and other high volume ETFs are going higher, perhaps to that level or higher.

Maybe coicidentally those ratios might line up for one price move, but they won't line up for any others.\n\nIt's difficult to check work that is done entirely in percentages. It assumes too much, like what the cost basis is. You can't just plug any old price in for the share price and expect that equality to hold. So what I advise is make this all concrete. Pick an actual share price and an actual SPY call quote and work in per-share dollars instead of percentages.
