The next day when I wake up, it's already 115. What???\n\nAt that moment, in my mind, it only made sense that it would go higher for the end of the day and next day, considering the very good reports by AMD that made NVDA go up in sympathy with it and also restored people's sentiment on the AI market + META's report, so I bought again, since I had already lost the 104 dip. I would only imagine it would go higher for today. Oh boy, was I wrong.\n\nIt did, in fact, go higher, up to 121 and then... We're already at 108.\n\nNow I'm bound to not selling until it reaches at least the same point where I bought it again (116), otherwise, the risk of loosing money and messing up more is higher, so I should just keep calm and not try to daily trade until I can at last sell off without money loss.\n\nNote that I'm not a fully financially developed person, I'm pretty young in a very underdeveloped country (Brazil), so I'm just keeping myself as calm and disciplined as I can to not lose money. I worked for a few months and saved some money that I told myself I should not waste, instead, it would be my opportunity to make more money out of that money, by investing into my main career (graphic design/branding) and learning how to effectively manage and multiply my earnings. But at some point, it starts rotting your mind a bit, when I keep constantly worrying about this rollercoaster of a chart while focusing on my studies/career, and also physical health/activities.\n\nNo, I'm not near my limit or anything, this not a venting post or anything, is more of a post to engage discussions in a way I could learn more about volatility and NVDA's behaviour. Yes I am fairly new to stock market, what made me go into NVDA is not extensive knowledge about stock market itself, is more due to knowing quite a lot about NVIDIA, and the way that my predictions from 2017, when I was only a 15yo boy seeing some very bright future for NVIDIA, turned out very correctly.
