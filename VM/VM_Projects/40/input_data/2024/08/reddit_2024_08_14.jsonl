Personally I dont think Google will outpace NVIDIA and they are two different companies. Google is software and Nvidia is hardware + CUDA (which isnt really a replicable software). Google's direct competitor is Microsoft and somehow META. I just think that Google's software side is incredibly replicable and that the shift from perspectives that their sales are gonna go from ads to AI will have a tough time. On the software end, I got Microsoft or even META. META just because Gen AI tools is going to be extremely connected to their biggest shtick which is content creator platforms, and the fact that META, IMHO, has the best AI research team. FAIR has been producing the best AI papers for the past years most esp in computer vision. People dont know that things such as Magic Eraser, Magic Lasso Tool root itself from META's Segment Anything which is the most ground breaking thing in Computer Vision alongside Diffusion Models. Microsoft too have strong integrations with software from Teams to MS Office suite and Windows. Most underrated is Github and Github Copilot. They literally \"own\" a shit ton of \"free code\" to train LLM models.\n\nFor AMD, I am not so well versed on their products. They wont be able to compete with NVIDIA some time in the future. Honestly, if I were them, I would just try to completely dunk on the sinking ship that is Intel and fabricate CPUs that tightly integrate with NVIDIA GPUs on cloud clusters (i do have a local AMD Ryzen laptop with RTX i use for local small training of models). Current virtual machines right now still have Intel + NVIDIA GPUs (e.g. V100, A10G). If AMD will just focus on beating Intel instead of NVDA, they could just win the AI race alongside them. If NVIDIA gets tired of Intel's bullshit, I can see them fabricating their own CPUs.\n\nNVIDIA will still be the strongest contender by a mile for atleast 5-7 years. I can't see anyone coming closely to rivaling their moat until then. Even if a war breaks out in Taiwan and new chips halt in production for some time, the remaining functioning data centers can still function IMO. One company that I suggest worth looking at is definitely Qualcomm. They are trying to enter the desktop space and making the edge device (phones, etc.) much beefier to have its own Neural Processing Unit that are capable to run multimodal models. As phones get better in that, they have less need to access cloud servers which in turn means less need for GPU servers (NVIDIA). Although Qualcomm's direct competitor at that space is Apple which is gonna do the same.\n\nI am not an FI, but as an AI engineer, I am bullish on NVIDIA. I would definitely think that it is quite overhyped by people right now because it has been an AI arms race and every one is trying to race which AI product will be the first to profit. The purchasing will slow down. However, believe it or not, we are just scratching the surface for what AI can do. Diffusion models are just only around for about 3 years, LLMs for 2.5 years, and we havent reached those breakthroughs to the \"traditional\" AI real money makers yet such as detection and reinforcement learning but I have a feeling that it will come out sooner.\n\nBut the thing is that comparing it to crypto is crazy because AI has business use cases and profitable as long as it has the proper market. NVIDIA is just creating more data centers to keep up with the cloud service demands from AWS, Azure, etc. but even if the demand gets low, they can always sell the access to services for cheap and still get money from it.\n\nBut who knows, that's the free market for you.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Wow thank you.

{"title": "Deep dive into Dutch Bros ($BROS)", "selftext": "**1.0 Introduction**\n\nDutch Bros ($BROS) is capturing the attention of many with its impressive location growth.\n\nWhat started as a small pushcart selling espresso drinks back in 1992, expanded to a chain with over 900 locations, posing the question: ***Is it the next Starbucks?***\n\n\n\n**2.0 The Secret To Its Success**\n\nUnlike the competitors, over ***90% of the business is conducted through drive-thru***, allowing it to operate using smaller (in size) shops.\n\n* 50% of all the revenue comes from the sale of coffee;\n* 25% from energy drinks (including its own proprietary Blue Rebel), and;\n* 25% from other beverages (teas, lemonades, sodas, and smoothies).\n\nSince 2008, the company has transitioned to an internal franchising model that required potential franchisees to have worked for the company for **at least three years**. Although this leads to fewer locations, it leads to better quality, which is best reflected in the number of closed locations. \n\nOver the last 5 years, **only one location was permanently closed** (back in 2021). Today, roughly 1/3 of all the locations are franchises.\n\nThe management expects a more capital-efficient market entry process that will begin to deliver a stronger new shop return after 2025. The different types of shops give the company greater flexibility to match the market needs in a certain area.\n\n\n\n  \n**3.0 The Potential Growth Drivers**\n\nThere are 3 ways the company’s topline will grow over time:\n\n**3.1 Number of locations**\n\nThe management’s long-term target **is 4,000+** locations (vs. 912 locations as of June 2024). At the current pace of \\~160/year, there are 2 decades of growth ahead.\n\nThis target represents roughly 10% of the total locations of Starbucks, which indicates:\n\n1. The management intends the company to remain focused on certain key markets.\n2. There are no plans for international expansion.\n\n***The number of new locations has been growing over time:***\n\n2018: **36 new locations**\n\n2019: **42**\n\n2020: **71**\n\n2021: **97**\n\n2022: **133**\n\n2023: **160**\n\nH1-2024: **81**\n\nThis means likely the target of 4,000+ locations will likely take 10-15 years to reach (instead of 20).\n\nIn my opinion, **Duch Bros isn’t the next Starbucks**, for the following reasons:\n\n1. Dutch Bros has a different business model leveraging drive-thrus.\n2. The management has no intention (currently) to grow to the size of Starbucks.\n\nOnce it reaches maturity, the excess cash flow generated will likely be used to buy back shares and/or dividends.\n\n**3.2 New product introduction**\n\nIn theory, introducing new products could lead to higher revenue per location. Based on the historical data, it is quite clear that this isn’t the case. The average revenue per location has been growing **more or less in line with inflation**. This means the sales coming from the new products introduced cannibalize the sales of the existing products.\n\n**3.3 Inflation**\n\nAlthough not in control of the company, inflation plays a role in its costs and will eventually be passed on to the consumers.\n\n  \nTherefore, for my estimate for the future revenue growth, I take into account the growth in the number of stores, and inflation.\n\n  \n**4.0 The Historical Financial Performance**\n\nLet’s take a look at the fun stuff. The revenue growth is definitely there, from $238m back in 2019 to $1.1b for the last twelve months (ending June 30th, 2024). However, the margins are a bit unstable.\n\nThere was a big drop due to Covid-19 when the demand was temporarily reduced. But the management cited two more reasons:\n\n1. Increase in rent; and\n\n2. Increase in direct costs (related to beverage, food, and packaging)\n\nSince 2022, the gross margin has been stable (\\~25%), but its operating margin has increased by 8%. The main reason behind it is - **Economies of scale**\n\nThe SG&A as % of revenue continues to decrease, leading to significant margin expansion. The management is targeting **30% Adjusted EBITDA**, which translates to **\\~18%** **operating margin**.\n\nFor comparison, this is slightly higher than the operating margin of Starbucks of 16%.\n\n\n\n**5.0 Valuation**\n\nBased on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is close to $5 billion (**$32/share**), not that far from today’s price ($29/share).\n\nThe revenue assumption has already been explained above. Based on my input, there will be a bit over 3,300 stores in 10 years. Combined with inflation, that leads to revenue increase of almost 400%.\n\nAs for the operating margin, I do think the management is overly optimistic, and the 18% operating margin is a stretch. For that reason, in my model, I’ve used **16% which is more in line with its mature competitors.**\n\n\n\nHere’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue growth & the operating margin:\n\n|Revenue / Operating margin|14%|16%|18%|CAGR (Revenue)|# of locations|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|342% ($5.0b)|$24,0|$29,0|$33,8|***16,0%***|***3,000***|\n|394% ($5.5b)|$26,7|$32,3|$37,6|***17,3%***|***3,352***|\n|416% ($5.8b)|$27,8|$33,7|$39,2|***17,8%***|***3,500***|\n\nAs I’m writing this, the share price is \\~$29, meaning **for Dutch Bros to be undervalued**, it needs to **increase the number of locations to at least 3,000** in the next decade and increase its **operating margin to at least 16%.**\n\nIf the management delivers the guided margin expansion to 18%, the fair value today is **over $35/share.**\n\nI hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.\n\n", "id": "1es8snp", "created_utc": 1723659410.0, "score": 67, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 51, "comments": [{"body": "Thanks for that write up, as I have been trying get more familiar with this company", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "It's my pleasure!", "score": 14, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "I wish we drank better coffee in this country, but I've watched my favorite local roasters go out of business one by one, while these chains grow steadily\n\nwe just don't have a cafe culture outside of big cities in the US, sadly. nobody has the hour to sit down and do nothing while they drink in a cafe and watch the world go by... everything is car-centric and go-go-go\n\nnice write-up!", "score": 31, "replies": [{"body": "The best coffee is in individual shop, not chains, in the US, and those unfortunately get gentrified out and replaced by Starbucks.
