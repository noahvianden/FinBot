It's market cap is way to high, this is a company that has a PE still over 450; that number only makes sense if investors are expecting future exponential growth - other tech companies have a PE in the 30 - 45 range.  This company is valued entirely on speculative growth, growth that will now be significantly stunted at best but in reality it's likely their earnings are going to shrink significantly going forward.\n\n  \nThis company was way overbought before the BSOD madness they unleashed on the world.
