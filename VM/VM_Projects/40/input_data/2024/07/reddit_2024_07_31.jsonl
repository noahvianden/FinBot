", "selftext": "# Morgan Stanley issued a top rating for Nvidia, noting the recent sell-off “presents a good entry point as we continue to hear strong data points short term and long term, with overblown competitive concerns.” \n\nNvidia's central position in the AI market and its ability to attract customers back from custom silicon alternatives highlight its enduring competitive edge. Analysts noted, “This is a large market and is not going to be served by a single NVIDIA card, but we are hearing multiple instances of customers who have invested in custom silicon or alternatives coming back to NVIDIA for upside.” \n\n**Morgan Stanley maintains a positive outlook for Nvidia stock, chiefly driven by robust demand indicators and strong customer enthusiasm for the Blackwell GPUs.** Visibility will actually increase as demand moves from Hopper to Blackwell, as the constraint will shift back to silicon; H100 lead times are short, but H200 lead times are already long, and Blackwell should be even longer. \n\nWith a valuation that appears “much more reasonable than a few weeks ago,” Morgan Stanley believes the market is “taking a very glass half-empty view of some of the hyperscale comments, where there is a clear desire on the part of customers to continue to commit resources to developing multi-modal generative AI.” ", "id": "1egnf90", "created_utc": 1722433141.0, "score": 133, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 52, "comments": [{"body": "Could it be...could it be...the sell-off was completely technical the entire time and folks were simply fear mongering with anything they could come up to justify a reasonable pullback, resulting in an echo chamber?\n\nthe \"mens horoscope\" dismissive enters the chat?", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "But then that eco-chamber must have been Wall Street?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "i’m referring to the Talking Heads that are trying to get clicks.

It's market cap is way to high, this is a company that has a PE still over 450; that number only makes sense if investors are expecting future exponential growth - other tech companies have a PE in the 30 - 45 range.  This company is valued entirely on speculative growth, growth that will now be significantly stunted at best but in reality it's likely their earnings are going to shrink significantly going forward.\n\n  \nThis company was way overbought before the BSOD madness they unleashed on the world.
