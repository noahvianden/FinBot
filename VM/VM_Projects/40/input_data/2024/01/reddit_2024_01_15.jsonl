And is $10 per share or the total amount, so divided by 100 that's $0.10/share?\n\n> But it was my initial understanding that you dont need capital of the value of the underlying asset, otherwise why not just trade in stocks/shares?\n\nOkay, there are several things going on here.\n\nFirst, there is a **big difference** between selling to open and buying to open. Your assumption about initial capital is correct for buying to open, but may or may not apply to selling to open. Selling to open, aka short selling, requires some amount of collateral against the assignment value of the contract, so the broker doesn't have to worry about you coming up short of cash if assignment happens. It's literally considered a reserve against that eventuality.\n\nSecond, there are two forms of selling to open a put. The implication of the broker's comment is that you are using a **cash-secured put** form. That means that in order to open the position and in lieu of 100 shares, you promise to pay cash equivalent to the value of 100 shares at the strike price as collateral. That's what cash-secured means. The other form, a leveraged short put, aka naked short put, doesn't require cash nor the full amount of the assignment value. The typical initial margin requirement is 20%-40% of the assignment value as a deduction in buying power.\n\nSo to sum up, the structure of the trade makes a big difference in how much it is going to cost you to open the trade. If you were *buying* a $10 strike put that had a $.07 ask, you'd have no problem doing that with only $50 of settled cash.

That’s an interesting stat that could help you decide whether you want to be long or short Vega at the open but I’m not sure how much it helps after you’re up and running. \n\nThis is a tough thing to remember but there is a difference between the IV of the stock and the IV of your particular options. If you buy options that expire shortly after a known event like earnings there will be vol risk priced into those contract.  So you will likely pay more for the contract than you would for the same amount of time when there isn’t an earnings included in the life of the option.  So even as the IV of the stock goes up, you may not see that reflected in the IV of your contracts as much as it may already be priced in.  So you need an IV spike that is greater than what was already priced in to make money on the IV rising.  This is why, IMO, buying options is a tough way to make a consistent living.  You have to exceed what the market thinks will happen to make anything, roughly speaking  you need to be outside of a standard deviation.  To me, that puts the odds against you.  Can you make money doing this?  Sure.  But in this case you are trading a known event.  The market makers know that earnings are coming just like you and everyone else does so their algorithms have computed what should happen statistically and the contracts are priced accordingly.  They’ll let you play this, but they will charge you more because earnings are involved.  \n\nYes, in theory an IV increase helps your position.  But what causes IV to move?  The expectation of a price move.  So if you don’t get much price movement, the IV of your contracts likely hasn’t moved even if the IV of the underlying has.  Another way to think about it is that you prepaid for a certain amount of IV increase in the stock when you bought the contracts.  So if the IV of the stock doesn’t exceed that, you don’t get paid more for it.  Not sure if that helps but it is important to understand the difference between the IV of a stock and the IV of an individual contract.  This gets even more important with things like calendars where you are dealing with different expirations but that’s a deep dive for another time and place.\n\nAnyway, hope this helps….", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yes thank you for the great answer.

I think the stock could reach $300 by that timeline if BTC goes parabolic months after the halving I'm just not sure how to decide which makes sense for best ROI in a best case scenario  (250-300-370). Assuming I'm correct in my thought process, how should I go about thinking about the exp price?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> months after the halving\n\nWhat do you mean by this, exactly? It's a good idea to assume the reader doesn't follow the stock you are talking about, so you have to explain catalyst events or other contexts that might be important.\n\nMy first advice is to stop thinking in terms of expiration price. Think in terms of what profit you want, either in dollars or as a percentage return, and how much you are willing to risk to get that profit. That's the first step: establish the risk/reward profile.\n\nLet me illustrate what a huge difference that decision can make. Let's look at percentage return. Say you want a 100% return minimum as profit. Well, that can be achieved by finding a COIN call that only costs $.01. If it goes up to $.02, that is a 100% return. It doesn't even matter whether COIN gets to $300 or not, all that matters is that the $.01 premium doubles to $.02.\n\nOn the other hand, if you want to make $100 profit on a call, you need to find a call that is going to gain $1 in premium. That might be a much more expensive ITM call that is as close to 1.0 delta as possible. In that case, only a little over a $1 move in COIN would achieve your profit goal.\n\nThinking in terms of risk/reward gives you a lot more flexibility than thinking in terms of the share price hitting $300 by date MMDDYYYY.\n\nOnce you have your risk/reward profile and profit goal settled, you can plug in some theoretical trades into an option price calculator like the two linked below and experiment. Which one offers the best deal, in whatever terms you decide are important. Want to minimize up-front cost and max loss? Buy the cheapest OTM call you can afford. Want to minimize theta decay and maximize delta payoff? Buy the deepest ITM call you can afford. Etc., etc. The calculator can help you see which profit/loss curve feels the most comfortable to you for your established risk/reward.\n\nhttps://optionstrat.com/build/long-call/COIN/.COIN240209C135\n\nhttps://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your advice, I've been using option profit calculator but I was sure I was missing things to think about aka what you just mentioned.

Your risk/reward is 4/1, so you need to win the trade 80% of the time to break even, but a 30 delta short implies only a 70% win rate.\n\nThe same $5 wide spread that pays $2 would be a terrific spread, since your risk/reward is now 3/2 and you only need a 60% win rate to break-even and the 30 delta implies a 70% win rate, so this spread should be profitable on average.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "PC, thanks for your detailed reply, and for putting the focus on risk:reward as a percentage of the spread.

In 2024, cord cutting 2.0 is about cutting the cord on expensive home Internet and getting new, less expensive options.*\r  \n\r  \n*Cord cutting 2.0 took off in 2023 as we saw Verizon and T-Mobile add 941,000 5G home Internet customers in the third quarter.

This news comes as most cable TV companies lost Internet subscribers in the third quarter of 2023.*\r  \n\r  \n*Cable broadband providers like Comcast and Spectrum are facing new competition not only from 5G home Internet services but also from fiber, fixed wireless access service providers, satellite services, and more. For the first time ever, Americans finally have options for home Internet, and they are starting to cut the Internet cord.*\r  \n\r  \n*This new access to more Internet service options has—for the first time—made it possible to completely break free from cable TV companies: Not only from the TV service but also from the Internet service.*\n\n*New providers are not the only factor contributing to subscriber losses. Pricing is heavily factored into peoples’ decisions on whether to switch providers.*\r  \n\r  \n*AT&T has also launched 5G home Internet services in 2023 to bring home Internet options to Americans who have not had options in the past.*\r  \n\r  \n*Much like in the early days of cord cutting 1.0, the growth of 2.0 is slow right now. We are waiting for more providers to join the market. Amazon announced plans to start offering home Internet next year. Other providers are quickly building out new kinds of Internet to give Americans options.*\r  \n\r  \n*Now as we move farther into 2024, cord cutting 2.0 is poised for rapid growth as Spectrum—one of the few cable TV companies to still be adding new Internet customers—says it expects to lose customers in the fourth quarter of 2023.*\n\n*Over the next five years, cable providers will have to deal with a growing number of competitors in a business that was once seen as their safe bet to fight cord cutting.
