{"title": "Revisiting China: A look to the Middle Kingdom as a lens for what’s next for Tesla", "selftext": "*Happy New Year —* *hope y'all like effort-posts.*\n\n# Let's talk about China. Again.\n\nAbout a year ago, I brain-dumped a post called [**You need to know what's going on in China**](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/xvlbeq/you_need_to_know_whats_going_on_in_china/)**,** framing what I saw as a huge gap in the public understanding of the Chinese market amid some discussion about Tesla's long-term ability to push market share there.\n\nUntil that point, we'd mostly seen soft-ball entries like the Wuling Mini and Ora Good Cat hitting the market, but as a China-watcher, it was clear that 2023 would be a different year in the Middle Kingdom with domestic players iterating at an incredible rate. Previously-vacant segments were waking up and seeing solid competitive efforts from companies like Geely and BYD for the first time, while boundary-pushing start-up models like the Xpeng G9 and Li L9 were pushing tech not yet adopted by any western automaker.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ql9tqbjlfbac1.jpg?width=1304&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a9cc2602ccef64fcbb2699b4f2f008f6b9c548f0\n\nThe conclusion was simple: China was no longer a nascent market — anyone participating there would need to compete hard or get left behind.\n\nA year on, the public understanding has changed significantly. The sudden shift has become incredibly obvious to the wider world as China becomes [the world's largest exporter of cars](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-65643064), and Chinese OEMs [start showing up at European auto shows](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/05/world/europe/chinese-automakers-iaa-mobility-german-auto-show.html).\n\nTraditional OEMs have now taken notice, too: Volkswagen is [now an investor in Xpeng](https://ir.xiaopeng.com/news-releases/news-release-details/xpeng-and-volkswagen-group-announce-entry-framework-agreement), and Stellantis is [now partnered with Leapmotor](https://www.stellantis.com/content/dam/stellantis-corporate/investors/events-and-presentations/presentations/STLA-LPM-Partnership-Presentation.pdf), just two of the names we talked about last time. Honda COO Shinji Aoyama probably had my most memorable quote of the year [after visiting the Shanghai Auto Show](https://archive.ph/iOnBQ) and putting it bluntly: \"We were overwhelmed by the Chinese.\"\n\nSo as we enter the new year, it's time for an update:\n\nWhat can we look forward to next, and how will that shape Tesla's path?\n\n*As a reminder: I'm not here to get you to buy any particular stock — I won't be talking about valuations. I am not an investor in any company listed here. I am not taking a bull or bear position within the context of this post. I run* r/chinacars *for fun, and read up on what's happening in the auto industry there every day (usually with my morning coffee) to better understand what I see as a quite substantive change in the global automotive landscape. I'm only sharing what I've learned for those interested in this part of the equation.* \n\n## The Undisputed King\n\nIt would be difficult to attempt any writeup of China without acknowledging the 800-pound gorilla that is BYD, so [let's start there](https://cnevpost.com/2023/12/01/byd-sells-record-301903-nevs-in-nov/): As of Q4 2023, the automaker is now the largest BEV OEM in the world on a quarterly basis, having recorded 525k BEV sales on top of an additional 450k in PHEV sales. BYD leaves 2023 hitting a 2.0M BEV run-rate, and with an increasingly diverse set of offerings. Exports [have tripled over the last year](https://carnewschina.com/2023/12/01/byd-sold-a-record-301903-vehicles-in-november-up-32-with-phev-sales-decreasing/), now holding at 30k per month.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5tz4g9sxjaac1.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cac3a4577f97021e333fbccacf0e5824493dcc9\n\nExpect to see more global expansion from BYD in 2024, and more models to match — the company will begin taking delivery of its own fleet of export ships, with eight of them on order at the moment. International manufacturing is also now planned, with both Hungary and Brazil announced.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bdicef40kaac1.jpg?width=690&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21324aa0071ecf4e25ff2df849b97952b2268e4d\n\nNew entries like the [Yuan Up](https://carnewschina.com/2023/12/08/byd-yuan-up-small-suv-leaks-revealing-pictures-and-specs/) are likely to be big hits in industrializing countries — possibly coming in as low as $15k-20k. Meanwhile, as we saw the Seal square up against the Model 3 last year, we'll now see an entire lineup of [Sea Lion](https://carnewschina.com/2023/11/20/byd-announced-sea-lion-is-becoming-a-new-product-line-with-sea-lion-05-and-06-coming-in-2024/) models going up directly against the Model Y.\n\nOther highlights this year will be the broader introduction of two new brands, Fangchangbao and Yangwang, both upmarket offerings for BYD, and both headed for export. Fangchengbao is BYD's 4x4 brand meant to take on the likes of Land Rover, and will start with three models, the [Bao 3](https://carnewschina.com/2023/11/02/byds-fcb-bao-3-exposed-in-china-compact-ev-off-roader/), [Bao 5](https://carnewschina.com/2023/11/09/byd-fang-cheng-bao-bao-5-to-officially-go-on-sale-today/), and [Bao 8](https://carnewschina.com/2023/10/27/byds-fang-cheng-bao-bao-8-spied-in-china-to-launch-in-2024/) — however, more interesting is probably Yangwang, the new ultra-luxury halo brand for the automaker. BYD has typically shown unyielding pragmatism in the past, preferring restrained mainstream scale to upmarket razzle-dazzle, so this signifies a big shift for them.\n\nYangwang's first offering is a $150k three-row do-everything EREV SUV capable of putting out over a thousand horsepower, doing tank turns, floating through high flood waters, equipped with satellite connectivity, crammed with compute from NVIDIA, featuring multiple lidar units, and sitting on a brand-new intelligent hydraulic suspension. [It's a showstopper](https://www.byd.com/us/news-list/BYD-Launched-the-U8-Premium-Edition-Under-Its-High-End-Sub-Brand-Yangwang).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yz7t2zd1kaac1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0783763e3de2d93c0f44b0d8595b4331380e274e\n\n***The Tesla Perspective:*** *Having such a small lineup is both an asset and a liability for Tesla. Tesla has done remarkably well holding the sales numbers it has, but also isn't able to play in many of the segments BYD has expanded into, and has minimal access to developing export markets like Brazil. Competitors the size of BYD could do some damage just by forcing Tesla into a price war leveraged by profitable segments and regions where they face less competition.*\n\n*Rushing Gen3 for production in Shanghai first (as Tesla did with Highland) could be the right play here to ensure China is properly-defended territory. A small crossover to compete with the Yuan Plus and Yuan Up will eventually be a must, as will a re-think of the Model X, which lacks the space and luxury Chinese consumers have come to expect from a high-end three-row.*\n\n## Li Auto: The Prodigy\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mkqbyo23paac1.jpg?width=1068&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8fe636a1749aee0b741cee961388c3ad3ec21bd6\n\nLi Xiang (known as Li Auto) was becoming a huge rising star in China last time we talked, and that trend has not stopped. The breakout L9 EREV has now been expanded into a full lineup including the slightly smaller L8, and even-smaller-yet L7. Combined, the three models now sell [over 50k units per month](https://cnevpost.com/2024/01/01/li-auto-to-challenge-100000-monthly-800000-annual-deliveries-2024/), which makes Li nearly as popular a brand in China as Tesla is.\n\nThis is notable for a couple reasons: One, because Li's offerings start at RMB 320k — higher than both the Model 3 and Model Y baselines, and two, because Li Auto was founded in 2015. That's right, this company is only eight years old.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9tcgt78dlaac1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ffcc31dc8a200fcbc3ae328bc5c51468e329816\n\nWe'll see Li add yet another to the L-Series lineup this year — the L6, Li's smallest. No hard details on this one yet ([just spy shots!](https://cnevpost.com/2023/08/18/spy-shots-li-auto-li-l6/)) but expect it to be a massive seller and priced competitively on the high end of where the Model Y sits.\n\nFinally in March, Li will also start deliveries of the Li MEGA BEV, an audacious MPV design, audaciously specced to match — a drag coefficient of 0.215 Cd, an AWD powertrain delivering 400kW and 700km range, CATL's bleeding-edge 5C battery delivering a peak charging rate of 520kW, and adorned with all the interior bits that made the Li L9 a huge success.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/02w7to38laac1.jpg?width=1399&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aac8093e1ff74074284359de416180811ea26a9f\n\n***The Tesla Perspective:*** *Li shows just how competitive Chinese OEMs can be, but probably the most noteworthy aspect of the company is how they've succeeded in rejecting minimalism while embracing maximalism. The L-Series models boast across-the-board AWD, intelligent air suspension, multiple 3K OLED screens, gesture controls, LIDAR arrays, adaptive HUDs, NVIDIA Orin compute, 21-speaker audio systems, electrically actuated footrests and thigh supports, centre-console minifridges, and more. The gull-winged Model X seems positively spartan in comparison.*\n\n*Li also shows a particular peculiar gap in the market for Tesla — while the Model Y AWD LR goes for around RMB 300k, the Model X doesn't start until RMB 740k. Li's entire lineup currently sits fully between those two posts on the ground.* \n\n## The rise of HIMA: Huawei's Superplatform\n\nLast year we talked a little bit about the AVATR 11, an impressive entry from state-owned Changan. Featuring Huawei-made drive units, electronics, lidar, and infotainment, it was clear at the time the company wanted to become a player in the automotive market, but we were unsure how far those aspirations extended.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1lnpui8akaac1.png?width=2360&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd4d79bd409651b3dd5e9e820b65322728c196c8\n\nWell, we've now seen Huawei's full plan. This November, Huawei formally announced the Harmony Intelligent Mobility Alliance, or HIMA, their bid to become a major player at the center of China's automotive industry. With HIMA, Huawei is establishing a roll-your-own model to the industry, and will supply cloud services, chips, software, powertrain components, and more to alliance members. By going down this path, Huawei essentially becomes a manufacturer without being a manufacturer and can focus on what it does best — the electronics and software side of the equation. It's a big deal.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xcdzwwpalaac1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=370afbded7db41f0162dad5b92f88185238af31e\n\nAt least five initial manufacturers have signed on, with nearly a dozen models already released or planned for release. Initial offerings already boast Huawei-designed infotainment and sound systems, Huawei-designed matrix headlights, Huawei-designed compute, Huawei-designed autonomy, and Huawei-designed powertrains. More models are coming, and HIMA members have already collectively announced run-rate goals well past a million units by 2025.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iaev126fkaac1.jpg?width=858&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d02415ffc84cf518e51811b7c079802a4a750c0\n\n***The Tesla Perspective:*** *HIMA presents an interesting challenge for every competing automaker, but it also shows a missing opportunity for Tesla to become a supplier as well as a manufacturer. We've seen some community discussion involving Tesla licensing properties like FSD, but you have to wonder if Tesla could also look into supplying or licensing motors, inverters, and more. We've also seen Tesla start to become a charging infrastructure supplier in North America — that same opportunity exists in China, if the cards are played right.*\n\n## The Second Wave\n\nIf last year was a forecast of rain, then what we're seeing this year is a torrential downpour from everyone else. We're now at a point where it would be exhausting to list all the upcoming mainstream EV models from domestic OEMs. What was bleeding edge last year is now table stakes, with gigacasting already in production or entering production at Xpeng, Nio, Leapmotor, Xiaomi, Neta, Changan, and Geely. Next-gen Qualcomm 8295 IVI chipsets, large-format OLED touchscreens, L2+ ADAS, LLM Chat, pop-out door handles, next-gen CATL Qilin packs, and 300kW+ SiC drive units are all rolling out across the industry.\n\nGeely's new Zeekr 007 seemingly takes the full laundry-list of future automotive tech and throws it all into one vehicle — all of the aforementioned items, plus an 800V electrical architecture, LIDAR-augmented ADAS, satellite communication, and more. Nearly all of this stuff is in-house, [*including the satellite constellation*](https://www.geely.com/en/news/2022/geespace-launches-nine-satellites), I kid you not.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/738va4shkaac1.jpg?width=3765&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5b1d4673e2ce86683b2118614243a99f580e53b\n\nEven the slower state-run manufacturers like Chery and Dongfeng are now joining the fray with the likes of the [eπ 007 ](https://carnewschina.com/2023/10/20/dongfeng-e%cf%80-007-all-electric-sedan-will-unveil-on-november-6-in-china/)and [Exeed Sterra](https://carnewschina.com/2023/11/18/chery-exeed-sterra-es-all-electric-sedan-with-905-km-range-pre-sale-starts-at-34400-usd-in-china/), and bigger names like Changan are now introducing multiple tiers of offerings — Changan Deepal's SL3i will now be joined by the [AVATR 12](https://carnewschina.com/2023/11/10/avatr-12-launched-in-china-with-578-hp-for-41265-usd/) and [Qiyuan A07](https://carnewschina.com/2023/09/14/changan-qiyuan-a07-sedan-pre-sale-starts-at-21700-usd-with-1200-comprehensive-range/), for instance.\n\n***The Tesla Perspective:*** *Some of these new models will be hits and some will be misses, but collectively they'll all continue to put pressure on the market. I've seen some speculation that this developing market saturation could lead to a whole new round of price wars, and that's something to consider. Tesla would do well continuing to aggressively cost-engineer Highland and Juniper downwards. With this much competition, there may not be enough food at the table for everyone to eat, so going capital-conservative might be the way to go.*\n\n*One of the repeated sentiments I've seen on Chinese social media is that Tesla is no longer the most technologically advanced brand in the market on paper, but consumers report buying it because it's a known quantity in much the same way Toyota is sometimes perceived in the west. In some sense, Tesla is benefitting from early momentum, making it the 'safe' choice for consumers looking to take less of a risk. Maintaining a reputation of quality in consumers' minds will be important going forward as EVs transition from being early-adopter products to mainstream products.* \n\n## Five to watch out for.\n\n**Geely Galaxy E8**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mwfpysk7yaac1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da1ca204ea95cc1057fea7a30edf549a0189394a\n\nWhile the Zeekr 007 is catching adoration from the press, Geely's more mainstream Galaxy E8 might be the one to keep track of, with stellar looks, specs to match, and a starting price of around RMB 190k ($26k USD). Stand-out numbers include 0.20Cd aerodynamics and a top-trim 475kW motor setup, but perhaps the most interesting thing for me: Geely's new infotainment system, powered by a Qualcomm 8295 SoC, a sprawling 45-inch 8K display, and Geely's in-house Android-based FlymeOS.\n\nIt's quite the visual statement — just look at the thing:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oyv6v41rlaac1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbf7b4f506b7c99b50230c8b8298558826e41780\n\n*Deliveries of the Galaxy E8 start in Q1 2024.*\n\n**Aion Hyper HT**\n\nAion is a brand from Guangzhou Automobile Group, a state-run automaker you wouldn't expect to be doing anything remarkable, until you take note of Guangzhou's role at the head of China's tech hub province of Guangdong. GAC got into EVs early with Aion, and has been slowly iterating over the years. The brand now quietly sells nearly 500k BEVs per year, mostly in lower price brackets than Tesla — but this year they iterate upwards.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i41lchxoraac1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a4e87bbae9fc1805fd3af4370bace2af8c35255\n\nThe highest 'Hyper HT' trim levels boast gullwing doors, a triple-lidar setup with L2+ city driving, an 800V electrical architecture, ultra-fast charging, massage seats, Dolby Atmos audio, and more. On the low end, you're getting a setup quite similar to a Model Y, but several thousand dollars cheaper, with more range and more power.\n\n*Deliveries are imminent.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Deepal S7i**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/le4avjmyraac1.jpg?width=3543&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c715667406b5f5ae65165dc7403296b06e87c8c0\n\nDeepal is already doing quite well in China — the HIMA-partnered sub-brand of Changan launched in 2022 as a three-way effort between Changan, Huawei, and CATL. Currently delivering over 100,000 cars per year, the brand [will continue to ramp up](https://carnewschina.com/2023/11/27/changans-deepal-plans-to-sell-450000-evs-in-2024-globally/) next year with the introduction of the brand's TMY-fighter, the S7i. Hard to beat [the formula here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGZ5agTdlos) — a no-nonsense mainstream crossover with a CATL pack and Huawei software sold at an attractive price.\n\nMy favourite feature? The passenger display which sits not in the dashboard, but rather in the sun visor, perfect for watching movies on a road trip:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oosp8br2laac1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=daf6b88e8a42c88c2cf08ce879fab03d952a4023\n\n*The S7i is already delivering to the tune of 10k units/month — expect that to grow.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**BYD Song L**\n\nEntries by BYD are rarely exciting on paper, but they somehow usually come together once you see the pricing and features  — the Song L doesn't [disappoint on either](https://carnewschina.com/2023/12/15/byd-song-l-launched-in-china-to-compete-with-model-y-starts-at-26700-usd/):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u1qk6u9bvaac1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4600c62612d8cc7c90b0b315352213a69e2a642b\n\nThe fastback crossover sits on an all-electric e-platform 3.0 and packs BYD's usual Blade architecture into an attractive package with all the fixings — frameless doors, pop-out handles, 20\" wheels, and a retractable rear wing, as well as BYD's latest 'DiLink' infotainment system. Powered by a 300 hp motor, the Song carries a range of 600km, and a killer starting price of 190,000 RMB, or about $26,000 USD.\n\n*Deliveries are starting now.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Luxeed S7**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z7v7pkbkpaac1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd49155c5763274c4b2fbb1e77e8fbab531f8d2e\n\nYet another play by Huawei's massive HIMA initiative, the Luxeed S7 is a flex, plain and simple. Huawei and partner Chery promise 0.203Cd aerodynamics, up to 855 kilometres of range, an 800V architecture capable of adding 430km in 15 minutes, Huawei's Harmony OS4 infotainment, Huawei's 'Pangu' LLM voice assistant, AI-powered battery-monitoring, computer-controlled dynamic suspension, and Huawei's full ADS 2.0 self-driving package, including L2 city driving and [parking valet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nPapNDA52I).\n\nIt's unlikely the S7 itself will breaking sales records just yet, but watch for the technology being shown off here to trickle down to other models soon.\n\n*Deliveries start in Q1 2024.* \n\n## Comparison Table\n\n*Last time, there were requests for some spec-to-spec comparisons, so here it is. Below is a hand-picked selection of vehicles likely to take on the TM3 and TMY over the next year or so in China. Where possible, I've tried to choose the best direct trim competitors to Tesla models — in some cases, lower or higher trim levels will be available. Generally speaking, you can expect the SR trims to be cut down on features, but the LR trims to be vaguely equivalent. If you'd like to take a deeper look, here are some additional trim configurations for the listed models:* [*BYD Song*](https://www.bydauto.com.cn/pc/carDetail/config?id=108&networkType=dynasty)*,* [*Hyper HT*](https://www.hyper.com.cn/vehicle/config/table?alias=hyper_ht&cid=50)*,* [*Xpeng G6*](https://www.xiaopeng.com/g6/configuration.html?fromto=GWDHSJ)*,* [*Deepal S7i*](https://www.deepal.com.cn/car/parameter?car=s7i)*,* [*BYD Seal*](https://www.bydauto.com.cn/pc/carDetail/config?id=73&networkType=ocean)*,* [*Galaxy E8*](https://www.galaxy-geely.com/E8)*,* [*Zeekr 007*](https://www.zeekrlife.com/config?modelInfoId=5)*,* [*Luxeed S7*](https://hima.auto/zhijie/s7/configuration/)*.*\n\n*Also note this table doesn't take into account things like limited-time pricing promotions or \"inventory\" discounts common to all manufacturers, Tesla included.

Electric vehicle demand in China is strongly driven by cities where licensing quotas exist — for instance [the ICCT notes](https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ID-24-%E2%80%93-NEVs-2023-briefing-A4-70114-v4_final.pdf):\n\n>*In 2015, Shanghai stood out as one of the major cities, alongside places like Shenzhen and Xi'an, where the proportion of PHEV passenger cars exceeded that of BEVs. This trend persisted in Shanghai through 2020 and 2021, with its PHEV share remaining relatively higher than in other cities. However, starting in 2023, Shanghai stopped exempting PHEV freight vehicles from traffic restrictions on urban roads, while continuing this privilege for BEVs and fuel cell electric freight vehicles. It also stopped offering preferential license plate access to PHEV cars, requiring new PHEV buyers to go through the same quota-system auction process as other conventional fuel car buyers.*  \n>  \n>*In addition, for new energy transit buses, the subsidy granted to PHEVs is lower and proportionally reduced based on how the actual fuel savings rate compares with the nominal value recorded in the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT)'s product catalogue. In contrast, Shenzhen relaxed its requirements to apply for a PHEV license plate, making PHEVs more appealing.*\n\nThe CPCA (in Chinese) [elaborates on another set of complexities](http://www.cpcaauto.com/newslist.php?types=csjd&id=3310):\n\n>*The market growth of new energy vehicles is expected to be relatively optimistic in 2024: the wholesale volume of new energy passenger vehicles is expected to reach 11 million units, with a net increase of 2.3 million units, a year-on-year increase of 22%, and a penetration rate of 40%. New energy passenger vehicles remain strong growth momentum.*  \n>  \n>*Judging from the three major purchase groups classified by national insurance data: rental, unit, and private, the current scale of the rental online car-hailing market is close to temporary saturation. The congestion pressure caused by online car-hailing has increased, and income has dropped significantly. The online ride-hailing market is facing problems such as mixed platforms and declining work performance-price ratio, and is on the eve of reshuffle and optimization; demand for pure electric and plug-in hybrid models in the unit electric vehicle market has gradually slowed down, and extended-range electric vehicles have continued to grow in recent months.*  \n>  \n>*In the market, the proportion of new energy in cities with purchase restrictions has declined, the proportion of high-end groups such as financial IT professionals in large cities purchasing electric vehicles has declined, and the proportion of sales in small and medium-sized cities and county and rural markets has increased significantly. Therefore, under the background that the current market scale has developed to a certain level, the growth rate will slow down. The same price strategy for oil and electricity has played a tenacious supporting role in the current market, but in the short term, the profit levels of related companies are under heavy pressure.*\n\nHard to know where this will all land, but the CPCA suggests EREV demand could remain strong, something which seems supported by the sudden upward trajectory of brands like Li.\n\n## Conclusions: Where does Tesla go next?\n\nLast time we talked, I concluded \"Tesla has the wiggle room to maintain sales leadership\" in a way that many of the Chinese domestic brands do not. I think this year has shown the company's ability to navigate that kind of challenge deftly, and some basic analysis suggests Tesla still has room to push volumes.\n\nWe already know Gen3 is coming, but I do consider it essential for Tesla to produce Gen3 in China sooner than anywhere else, and I'm hoping they make that pivot. Lack of diversity in general continues to be a risk for Tesla, and Chinese OEMs are iterating quickly in multiple segments Tesla isn't currently touching.\n\nBoth Highland and Juniper can contribute. Some conservative predictions for Juniper: The adoption of OLED panels and pop-out door handles on higher trim levels, while I think having a lower-trim RMB 220,000 model with a sub-200kW drivetrain could significantly improve TAM and allow volumes to be maintained.\n\nThe important three-row segment is another risk in China, a country where multi-generational households are the norm, and advertisements frequently show mom and dad up front, grandma and grandpa in the second row, and the kids in the back. While the Model Y has some applicability here, I think the Model X (already stale in North America) is a pressing concern — take a look at [the Huawei Aito M9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaKCTcFEYB4) as an emblem of where the Chinese market is headed, but also note the Li L-Series mentioned earlier, and the complete absence of Tesla in the RMB 400k-700k range.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pebwcbqkkaac1.jpg?width=1148&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e4d77ef53b81a62a803c294f2be7ab4c6bad1a6a\n\nSome new business opportunities presented by Chinese competitors: While Musk has pushed X.AI and Grok as a business vertical for X, the adoption of LLMs among Chinese automakers shows a much more obvious path to me. Who among us wouldn't pay an additional $5/mo for an in-car conversational assistant capable of checking restaurant hours, making reservations, navigating around traffic jams on request, and intelligently summarizing new emails?\n\nLooking towards hardware commoditization would be wise. Supercharging seems like an obvious path forward, but if Tesla's next-gen drive units really lead the pack, there's a real opportunity to take on the role of supplier. Same goes with 4680 dry cells, if the program improves.\n\nWhatever happens in 2024, we're in for a trip. Chinese OEMs are overwhelmingly pushing forward with some damned impressive product. Companies like Geely, Li, and BYD firing on all cylinders while Huawei builds up nothing short of an empire.\n\nKeep an eye out — there's sure to be some really interesting developments.\n\nTLDR:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9q4lvpv7qaac1.jpg?width=2042&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42559a5876762e14a07195b9cc28d674e567436c\n\n## Special thanks\n\nBigs ups to these websites for carrying the torch of English-language coverage of the Chinese market: \n\n* [CarNewsChina](https://carnewschina.com/) has been doing this for a long, long time, and is the best bookmark for day-to-day news and model info, with some occasional [great long-form content](https://carnewschina.com/2021/08/01/the-big-read-history-of-byd/).\n* [CnEVPost](https://cnevpost.com/) has a bit more of a financial perspective, and regularly tracks delivery numbers and stock movements, with a focus on startups.

Very few of the names mentioned in the post are state-owned however, and those which are state-owned are rarely competing with Tesla. Li and BYD are both private companies, for instance.\n\nOf the three main centrally-state-owned companies (FAW, Dongfeng, Changan) only Changan is really meaningfully an EV player competing with Tesla right now (via Deepal) — both FAW and Dongfeng have been holding back. Only two other provincially-owned automakers (SAIC, GAC) compete with Tesla at all, and I cover GAC's situation in the post — it has traditionally come in well under Tesla's price point.\n\n>The fact that Tesla is in that environment making a solid showing, not to mention created and fully functional in the free market, is a tremendous achievement.\n\nCo-signed to a degree, although never forget that Tesla is also explicitly the product of many, many subsidies, and would never be where it is right now without them.

You've now heard of these brands and their cars. \n\n>how much of this production is like all the empty apartments that will never get lived in.\n\nNone of it.

It is a profitable company, with positive margins, producing according to demand.\n\n>Is there any one of these Chinese car companies that is not commanded by the CCP in terms of what they focus on, what they produce, where they build and in what volume.\n\nBYD, Geely, Li, and most of the other names mentioned are private companies.
