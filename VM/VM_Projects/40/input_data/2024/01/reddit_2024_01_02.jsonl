What you do is neither trading, nor investing, it is stock market roulettte.\n\nIf you want to trade, you need to have an eye on your position size, predetermine your buy/sell levels and do at least some form of (technical) analysis of price movements, news, sentiments etc.\n\nIf you want to invest, why sell equity in a company after it has risen 2.5%? Is this a magical number you came up with in a random lucid dream you had or what's the matter with it? You **have to** understand that what you do is completely random, your success is based on luck and hardly reproducible.\n\nThe best way to approach investing is to find a strategy, that is a) consistent and sustainable, b) not losing you money c) reproducible with any amount of capital. Let the compound interest work for you. If you want to pick companies, fine. But at some point you arrive at a level of capital where it is not feasible anymore to pick single stocks because the risk becomes too great for a mere dumb money investor like us. So at some point you have to just diversify, achieve market returns and be happy with it.\n\n2023 was one of the most exceptional years within the last 50 years and you made some money with stock market roulette. That is great, but it will not last and losing money is the worst setback for compound interest. So stop doing whatever you do for your own good.\n\np.s.: about the margin thing, just dont do it. Really. Dont do. Do not use margin. It is the fastest way to lose your money and it is groteseque that every hobo gets margin on his brokerage account. It is pure evil and it will lose you everything. From Feb. 2020 to March 2020, the world-wide stock market fell 30% within 20 trading days. Even though circruit breakers were at play (intra-day trading halts if the market drops more than a couple % within a short time frame). Other assets without these circruit breakers fell 50-60% within 20 trading days, just as comparison. These are events that happen every 20-30 years. But they do and you dont want to risk everything on such an event e.g., china invading taiwan and it is -30% within one week. Also your blue chips will go bell-up. Just dont do margin, because you have to realize that with margin, you dont own what you buy. If you own what you buy, you cannot lose in the longterm, as long as what you buy is valuable.
