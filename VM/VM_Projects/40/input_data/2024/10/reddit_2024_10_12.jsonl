That is not to be underestimated. His vision of how the company will move forward is misguided, but to be predicted because he is not a detail oriented person.\n\nLet me explain. When Steve Jobs came back to Apple a simple view would indicate that Steve is a God and he magically did everything. However if you look closer and read his biography you would understand the second time around Steve delegated.\n\nMeaning...\n\nSteve had Ives, and Cook to do the details and he left them to do their stuff. With Jobs dead, Ives left and Cook running the show you see Apple has made minimal progression in innovation. The exact opposite has occurred with Tesla. Musk with the Tesla corporation has not delegated out his roles and he micro-manages. That is truly problematic because his car models are languishing compared to the competition. He believes (incorrectly) that cyber cab will save Tesla. It will not because you can't just focus on one thing. That's the problem of Musk. He has tunnel vision. He is not building a corporation.\n\nIn contrast his investments in Starlink, and other companies are doing well (ok not Twitter) because he has delegated it all out. The ones in charge can focus running a company.\n\nWhat you also need to understand, Tesla does NOT own shares in Twitter, SpaceX, or any other venture. That is all owned by Musk. Meaning you as a Tesla shareholder get absolutely no benefit when those ventures do well. I would be worried that Musk might just say, \"yeah moving on not interested anymore.\" Tesla is not a long term play anymore.
