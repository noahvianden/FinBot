{"title": "Beating The Market Using Double Debits & PMCC's", "selftext": "I am a profitable trader, this is made possible by working odds in my favor. There are two ways can have odds work in your favor, the first is not picking direction, the second is utilizing more time to get it right.\n\n**How I Utilize Double Debit/Diagonals**\n\n1. On the day-of earning's, I *do not pick direction,* instead I trade neutrally betting to both directions. This cuts my profit overall but it's not 50/50 coin flip anymore. I make something from pretty much every single earnings now like clock work.\n2. I'll look at the implied move and prior implied moves. TSLA had an implied move of 12%, the past three earnings were also 12%.\n3. I opened double debit spread, buying 5% out or $205/$225, then I sold 10% out or $192.5/$237.5 - It looks like I could've sold 12% but I am deep ITM now and another successful earnings locked-in.\n\nWith big movers, there's no need to pick direction on earnings. If TSLA didn't move much, would've still been a 7-8% move which puts me ITM. I'm trying to build intrinsic value, sizing the move, not timing it or picking direction because I know when the move will take place and am trading neutrally so do not need to pick direction.\n\n**How I Utilize Poor Man's Covered Calls**\n\n1. I go to NASDAQ, look at the financials of the ticker, check the gross profit, operating income, and net income. Am looking at the last four years, seeing if a company is growing. Then I'll check the P/E ratio, 5 year trend, and PEG ratio to see if am getting a deal on this growing company.\n2. Then will buy LEAPS as far as possible in this case 2027, selling covered calls, rolling out in time to never be assigned with the entire goal of building as much intrinsic value as possible while gaining premium through CC's.\n3. Growth machines like DKNG, PLTR, NU, ADMA, S, HIMS, GRAB, (may not present currently favorable deals) but these companies are making more and more money, over next two years chances are can make substantial intrinsic value.\n\nIf you want to trade options there's a necessary understanding of intrinsic value vs extrinsic value, LEAPS are the most profitable options structure when utilized on the correct companies, the opportunity to build deep intrinsic value is unrivaled.\n\n**CONCLUSION:** Earnings are easy pay days, just stop picking direction and use double debit spread to build intrinsic value, buying as little time as possible on a big mover. Even LMT double debit spread was profitable this week for me and it's a slow mover. LEAPS are the best way to build intrinsic value, utilize the leverage on true companies growing their fundamentals YoY, then sell CC's to keep reducing your overall risk as the years pass.

SDA & Link16. Redwire does more than provide RF and Antennas for RKLB's SDA satellites, they are also base lined into York and other providers platforms.\n2. Rocket Structures. Something that alot of people dont know is that Redwire is also helping X-bow systems with the SRM production by supplying the company with structures for their bolt family of rockets.\n3. Moon & Mars. Redwire has lunar and martian optionality, they have multiple different lunar contract like MASON with NASA/tipping point which is for building landing pads and roads using regolith & VSAT which is a partnership with the company astrobotic where Redwire is providing ROSA arrays of various sizes to provide power for the lunar surface. For Mars Redwire has been [awarded a study contract for Design Reference Mission (DRM) 3 of NASA’s Mars Commercial Services program](https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/planets/mars/nasa-selects-commercial-service-studies-to-enable-mars-robotic-science/), which outlines a commercial imagery mission to support lower-cost, higher-frequency missions to the Red Planet\n\nThere is in fact even more I could talk about too but ill cut it here, thanks for the post and the visability into a great company.", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "Should I sell my rklb and load up on this?
