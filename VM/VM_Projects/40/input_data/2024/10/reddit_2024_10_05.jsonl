Let's hope NVDA & NVDL Moon soon!\n\n-------------------------------------------\n\n[Nvidia CEO's bombshell raises the bar for the stock](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-ceos-bombshell-raises-bar-130300278.html)\n\nDemand is \"insane,\" Nvidia’s chief executive Jensen Huang recently said. Major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud are integrating Blackwell into their infrastructure to support high-performance AI workloads.\n\n[Related: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just told investors what’s next for the AI chipmaker](https://www.thestreet.com/technology/nvidias-jensen-huang-addressed-three-big-questions-about-ai-future)\n\nOracle [announced](https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-to-invest-in-ai-and-cloud-computing-in-malaysia-2024-10-02/) on October 2 that it would need 131,072 Nvidia Blackwell GPUs as part of a $6.5 billion investment to establish a new public cloud region in Malaysia, another proof of a strong need for advanced AI processing capabilities.\n\nBlackwell is a platform Nvidia launched in March that allows organizations to run real-time generative AI on models with trillions of parameters. These large language models are trained on extensive datasets to understand and generate responses in human language.\n\n“Blackwell is in full production,” Huang said in an interview with CNBC. “The demand for Blackwell is insane. Everybody wants to have the most, and everybody wants to be first.”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zughhelbh0td1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74dfe554a368a5c010f7ea4fd94cf43723edf206\n\nNvidia's stock has surged by over 150% this year, following an impressive 240% gain in 2023.\n\nHyperscaler buyers like Amazon  ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN)) , Microsoft  ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT)) , and Alphabet  ([GOOGL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOGL))  are expected to spend around $160 billion in 2024 on AI infrastructure, according to Bernstein analysts. The cost of Blackwell is expected to range between $30,000 and $40,000 per unit.\n\nHuang emphasized the importance of continuous updates to Nvidia’s AI infrastructure, with the company releasing new platforms annually. “If we can increase the performance, like we've done for Hopper and Blackwell ... we're effectively increasing the revenue or throughput for our customers on these infrastructures by a couple to three times each year,\" Huang added.\n\n# Nvidia's financial performance exceeds expectations\n\nNvidia’s latest earnings report further solidifies its strong position in the AI market.\n\nOn August 28, the company posted earnings per share of 68 cents, beating Wall Street expectations of 64 cents. Revenue hit $30.04 billion, up 122%, surpassing the anticipated $28.7 billion.\n\nNvidia forecasts $32.5 billion in revenue for the current quarter, an 80% increase from last year.\n\n[Related: Veteran trader targets Nvidia as shares slide](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/veteran-trader-targets-nvidia-as-shares-slide)\n\nNvidia plans to ship Blackwell GPUs to clients in Q4 of this year, with a consumer release expected in 2025. “In the fourth quarter, we expect to ship several billion dollars in Blackwell revenue,” Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said during the August earnings call.\n\nNvidia's stock has surged by over 150% this year, following an impressive 240% gain in 2023. The company is now worth over $3 trillion, one of the most valuable companies in the world just behind Apple and Microsoft.\n\n# Analyst sees \"compelling\" growth and valuation for Nvidia\n\nJPMorgan remains confident in Nvidia’s outlook, maintaining an overweight rating and a $155 price target, [thefly.com](http://thefly.com/) reported.\n\n\"Nvidia remains on track to ship its next-generation Blackwell graphic processing unit platform in high volume production in Q4,\" the analyst tells investors in a research note on October 2, adding that investors do not have to pay too much attention to the recent sell-side noise on rackscale portfolio changes.\n\nNvidia is halting development of its dual-rack 72-way GB200-based NVL36×2, TF International Securities's analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said on Oct. 1.\n\nLast month, Bank of America reiterated a buy rating and $165 price target on Nvidia, which the firm also calls its top sector pick.\n\nThe firm warned of several near-term headwinds, including Blackwell's delay and gross margin pressure, a potential DOJ probe, competition, AI monetization, cloud capex, weak seasonality, and the U.S. elections.\n\n**More AI Stocks:**\n\n* [Apple stock slides as big iPhone 16 bet sputters](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/apple-stock-slides-as-reports-suggest-muted-early-iphone-16-demand)\n* [Analyst revisits Meta stock price target as Facebook parent ramps AI spend](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/analyst-revisits-meta-stock-price-target-as-facebook-parent-ramps-ai-spend)\n* [Analyst reviews BlackRock stock rating after AI partnership with Microsoft](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/microsoft-blackrock-and-nvidia-unite-for-30b-ai-power-play)\n\nHowever, this could also create a buying opportunity. The stock is trading within the lowest quartile of valuation in the past five years, the analyst said.\n\nThe firm highlights Nvidia's \"compelling growth\" and says upcoming supply chain updates in the next few weeks will confirm Blackwell product shipments, which they see as the main factor for a recovery.\n\n  \n", "id": "1fx1p67", "created_utc": 1728166213.0, "score": 119, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 55, "comments": [{"body": "Why was anyone surprised by this?

{"title": "It's time for the regular \"what low cost stocks should I wheel?\" Post of the day... but I'm seeking to diversify my wheel strategy so hopefully this can be a little different...", "selftext": "Yeah I know everyone hates these posts. I hope I can make it a little more palatable by sharing more than I get.\n\n\n\nI currently have a basket of stocks I wheel.  I run my wheel slightly different than u/scottishtrader initially explained (where i learned about it). \n\n\n\nFirst,  I use naked puts, not cash secured puts.  I rarely get assigned as i sell delta .20 or less, and on my losses I usually take it until I can roll the wheel or liquidate the position for a loss. I'm still learning but this has worked well for me so far.\n\n\n\nI like wheeling ETFs over stocks as ETFs are better diversified against a single stock dropping at the expense of sector risk and usually reduced premiums.  But the larger reason is \"wheel stocks you don't mind owning\" and I usually like ETFs over single stock picking.  \n\n\n\nI try to diversify based on rolling expiry dates,  so if the stock drops in the money i have time to manage. But usually I don't close and let the puts expire otm. So this is one reason I'm looking at new targets - i don't like keeping multiple wheels open at a time on same ticker.  Feels like  I'm not diversified. \n\n\n\nI try to diversify across market sectors so a drop in one thing or a general market trend doesn't wipe all my positions. \n\n\n\nHappy to discuss any particulars but would like to share my current wheelhouse and see if anyone has any stocks or ETF recommendations that might fit in.  \n\n\n\nSOXL: this is my favorite. as a 3x etf the premiums are good and not too expensive.  I've been assigned a few times but usually exit fairly quick. \n\n\n\nTQQQ: as above,  3x etf means higher premium and this represents my exposure to the market at large. I like the concept of HFEA, so i use this with TMF (below) as a way to obtain shares as its cheaper than UPRO for a similar mega cap exposure. The wheel means I might miss on the large pumps that HFEA is supposed to capture, but that's OK with me as this has still been profitable. I started this when TQQQ was much cheaper than UPRO, but now that it is getting more in parity I may switch back\n\n\n\nTMF: the bond part of HFEA. Concept is more likely to be negatively correlated with the stock market as a whole. Premiums tend to variable so I don't play this often. \n\n\n\nMSOS: US etf based on a gamble that eventually pot will get legalized at the federal level.  It's cheap so i milk it for a few bucks a month as assignment risk is easy to deal with if I'm assigned.\n\n\n\nGME: nice premium due to all the apes over at wsb. I'm not a big believer in the short squeeze hypothesis,  but I do like the premiums for the low price of the stock. Other meme stocks don't really fit the \"stocks I don't mind owning\" part of the wheel, but this one I'm OK with.\n\n\n\nINTC: this is one I've taken recent losses on,  but I still turn a few wheels a month. There is a lot of debate on this stock but to me it's essentially a bet on is their turnaround plan will work. If not,  it will probably slowly continue to decline and I'll take the loss,  but as a low price stock I'm OK with the position as a gamble on the turnaround. \n\n\n\nPFE: cheap and variable premium. I will wheel this a few times a year. They don't have many new blockbusters in the drug pipeline but I consider it a blue chip stock that isn't likely to drop dramatically. \n\n\n\nZION: small banking company in the Intermountain west. Stable Financials but they are part of the Mormons' investment portfolio.  It's a moat as i have great faith in the corruption of the Mormon church to not let their investments fail.  \n\n\n\nRKLB: cheap stock with good relative premium based on a unique business niche. \n\n\n\nUUUU: read a good due diligence post on this somewhere.  I think it was r/valueinvesting. Basically its a uranium mining company with lots of good future expansion options and no debt. It's dirt cheap so I figured what the hell?\n\n\n\nHUT: this is my crypto diversifyer. They are a bitcoin mining company,  and that tends to track the market as a whole.  Cheap,  usually not good premium anymore though.  I still look at it every few weeks but haven't opened a position in a while.  \n\n\n\nAnyway,  that's my current wheeling bucket.  Looking at TNA but haven't decided yet on if I'd like to own that.  \n\n\n\nIf you have any stocks or ETFs you like to harvest premium on,  let me know.
