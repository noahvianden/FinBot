I do not sell on margin, nor do I sell naked options.\n\nAll options and profits stay in the account with few exceptions. I took out $17K earlier this year for taxes and various expenses. I replaced some of the $17K with a $9K deposit recently. This is not my full time job, although I wish it was. I still grind on a 9-5. \n\nAdded $500 in contributions to the portfolio.

{"title": "Silver Breaks $33! 🚀 Next Stop: $50? Inflation + Demand = Massive Run 🔥", "selftext": "[Silver Ounce\\/ U.S. Dollar, 4h](https://preview.redd.it/ich5v6di6mvd1.png?width=2456&format=png&auto=webp&s=a889ae7a750d022215469a70a8b74b63faaf5cb9)\n\n**Context:**\n\nSilver apes, it’s happening. We just broke $33.68, and the charts are screaming bullish. This isn’t just your average end of week move; this is silver gearing up for something big. With inflation still out of control and central banks scrambling, it’s only a matter of time before silver shoots up even more.\n\n**Here’s why I think we’re in for a massive run:**\n\n1. **Key Resistance Broken:** We’ve been watching the $32-32.5/Oz resistance for weeks (touched the resistance 5x and bounced back each time), and now that we’ve smashed through it, we could easily be seeing silver charge to $35/Oz in no time. This is a breakout move that’s catching a lot of attention.\n2. **Silver Demand is Heating Up:** With its role in electronics and solar tech as well as a safe-haven asset, the demand for silver is surging. And supply? Still constrained. This imbalance means silver prices are set to keep climbing, especially with industrial demand keeping pressure on supply chains.\n3. **Dollar Weakness:** As the USD wobbles, silver gains strength. If the dollar stays weak, silver’s going to continue its upward trajectory.\n\nWith $35 in sight, this is looking like the start of a massive silver rally. Last time we saw this setup, silver skyrocketed to $50—so the potential here is huge.\n\nP.S. (Even if the feds manage to keep the dollar under control in the short-term for the fist time in history we are seeing the value of precious metals not being inversely affected by the USDIndex. This should be a strong indicator of what's about to happen.)\n\n**My Call:**\n\nLong and looking for a move to $35-$40/Oz. If you’re not stacking your silver now, you’ll be wishing you did when we’re sitting at $50/Oz. 🦍🚀\n\n**Reminder:**\n\nThis is a **long play**, and when silver moves, it moves hard.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\n**PEOPLE NEED ARTICLES TO CONVINCE THEM WATER IS A HUMAN NEED:**\n\nIf this doesn't convince you, you are beyond saving. Go long on the NVIDIA dip ahahaha:\n\n**REFERENCES:**\n\n[https://www.silverbullion.com.sg/GoldSilverRatio](https://www.silverbullion.com.sg/GoldSilverRatio)\n\n[https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/](https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/)\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-17/gold-hovers-near-record-as-mideast-tensions-spark-haven-demand](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-17/gold-hovers-near-record-as-mideast-tensions-spark-haven-demand)\n\n[https://metalsedge.com/the-impact-of-global-political-events-on-precious-metals-prices](https://metalsedge.com/the-impact-of-global-political-events-on-precious-metals-prices)\n\nLet’s dive deeper into why silver remains a compelling safe haven asset, backed by concrete data and relevant sources.\n\n**1. Industrial Demand Continues to Surge**\n\nSilver isn’t just a precious metal; it’s a critical component in various high-growth industries. According to the **Silver Institute's 2024 World Silver Survey**, industrial demand for silver is projected to reach **550 million ounces** this year, a significant increase driven by its applications in electronics, solar energy, and electric vehicles.\n\n* **Electronics**: Silver’s unparalleled electrical conductivity makes it indispensable in smartphones, laptops, and other consumer electronics.\n* **Solar Panels**: With the global push towards renewable energy, silver’s role in photovoltaic cells ensures sustained demand.\n* **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: The rise of EVs has boosted silver usage in batteries and other components, contributing to its demand surge.\n\n**2. Supply Constraints Intensify**\n\nDespite increasing demand, silver production hasn’t kept pace. The **World Silver Survey 2024** highlights a **supply deficit of 80 million ounces** this year. Key factors include:\n\n* **Mining Challenges**: Several major silver mines have faced operational disruptions due to geopolitical tensions and environmental regulations.\n* **Limited New Projects**: Investment in new silver mining projects remains low, causing a bottleneck in supply.\n\n**3. Investment Demand on the Rise**\n\nSilver ETFs and other investment vehicles are witnessing renewed interest. Data from **Bloomberg** indicates that silver ETF inflows have increased by **15%** in the first half of 2024. This uptick is fueled by:\n\n* **Affordability**: Silver remains more accessible than gold, attracting retail investors looking for cost-effective entry points.\n* **Hedge Against Economic Uncertainty**: Even as inflation rates stabilize, silver continues to serve as a hedge against market volatility and currency fluctuations.\n\n**4. Geopolitical Tensions and Safe Haven Appeal**\n\nIn times of geopolitical instability, investors flock to safe haven assets. Silver, like gold, benefits from this sentiment. The ongoing **trade tensions between major economies** and **regional conflicts** have heightened the demand for tangible assets that retain value amidst uncertainty.\n\n**5. Technological Advancements Enhancing Silver’s Value**\n\nInnovations in technology are expanding silver’s applications, further solidifying its status as a valuable asset. Breakthroughs in **nanotechnology** and **medical devices** are opening new avenues for silver usage, ensuring sustained and diversified demand.\n\n**6. Gold-to-Silver Ratio Indicates Undervaluation**\n\nThe **gold-to-silver ratio** is currently around **70:1**, historically signalling that silver is undervalued relative to gold", "id": "1g6xtr4", "created_utc": 1729300682.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.5, "num_comments": 44, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 4 | **First Seen In WSB** | 10 hours ago\n**Total Comments** | 1 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "wtf is this useless word vomit post?

It’s a **tangible asset**, meaning it has physical presence and cannot be easily devalued like fiat currencies. People trust precious metals during times of financial instability because they retain value over time.\n* **Hedge Against Inflation:**\n   * Historically, silver has acted as a hedge against inflation. When the value of paper currency decreases due to inflation, the price of silver typically rises. This is because silver, like gold, tends to hold its value as fiat currencies lose purchasing power.\n* **Industrial and Safe-Haven Demand**:\n   * Unlike gold, silver has significant **industrial demand**. It’s used in electronics, solar panels, medical devices, and other applications. This dual demand (as an industrial and investment metal) creates a unique dynamic where silver benefits both from market speculation and physical demand, making it more resilient.\n* **Historical Precedent**:\n   * During past economic crises, such as the 2008 financial crisis, silver (and gold) prices surged as investors sought out these assets to protect their wealth from collapsing stock markets and devaluing currencies.\n\nBut hey what do I know, just a guy looking at the stats... :P", "score": -7, "replies": [{"body": "Look, I love your enthusiasm.
