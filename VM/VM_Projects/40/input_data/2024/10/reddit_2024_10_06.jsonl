Plus, there will be opportunities for networking with big names like Microsoft and Dell!\n\nIt's a hybrid event, so both in-person and virtual attendance options are available. I‚Äôm curious to see how the discussions will unfold and what innovations will be presented.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the summit?

He will be focussed on paying down his debt\n\nNow apply this to the majority of the country's consumers and companies (yes...companies also leveraged when times were good) and you have a situation that requires much more than the recent stimulus package\n\n2 - the stimulus package only helps the stock market...and let's be frank here...this is your main focus...if you think China is going on a sustained bull market for a year, then you are shit out of luck...because it will be evident in a couple of months to half a year from now that the main issue of demand has not been addressed...now China is going to do a further round of stimulus and they will announce it soon...you will need to pay close attention to what form of stimulus is employed...if the CCP are going to take it on themselves to spend and create demand, then full port in...if it's just further rate cuts and making it easier for companies and individuals to buy stocks, then this will eventually be ineffectual\n\nThe CCP is spending around 300 billion USD on purchasing sovereign bonds in two phases...the US spent close to 5 trillion in stimulus to kickstart the economy again after COVID...if it took 5 trillion to help the US get back on its feet again, where do you think 300 billion is going to get China?  The stock market is breaking out not because the stimulus is going to fix the economy...it's breaking out because there is more liquidity to buy stocks...and remember the classic saying?  \"The stock market isn't the economy and vice versa\"\n\nAsk yourself why the government is pumping liquidity into the stock markets instead of trying to revive the housing market?  Because it is easier to get the stock markets to rise than it is to get housing prices to rise...but unfortunately for a majority of Chinese consumers, most of their wealth is tied up in the property they are occupying...only a fraction of the Chinese actually invest in the stock markets\n\nIt's been reported that 6.5 trillion USD has been wiped out of the Chinese stock market in the last few years...by comparison, the real estate market loses around 2.7 trillion USD in value for every 5% drop in prices (Bloomberg)...and as I mentioned earlier, most places have dropped by 30% or more in value...this works out to be close to 17 trillion USD in equity wiped out...so the Government is cutting rates by 0.5%...some will be able to refinance their mortgage...but what investor is going to look at this rate cut and immediately think...\"wow, I'm going to go out and buy property again\"...the lack of demand and confidence in real estate prices has become so deep rooted that it's going to take much more than 0.5 % cuts to get confidence back...this is exactly the same thing that happen to Japan and even when rates were cut to zero, they still couldn't get demand back for more than a decade...I'm not saying China will end up exactly the same...I'm pointing out that this recent round of stimulus doesn't do anything significant for the macro economy\n\n3 - That whole paragraph about \"changing new world order\" is such gibberish....I can't believe people actually subscribe to these obscure ideas and actually include this as part of their DD\n\nFirst off...half the countries you listed as trade partners would never abandon the USD because they hate China...even if it would benefit them economically, they would never resort to such measures because they would not want to alienate themselves from the US and the western world...the other half of countries you listed...lol...they are all economically insignificant shitholes that will not affect the US at all with what they do\n\n\"Perhaps their new currency would be backed by Oil, Gold, Metals, agricultural goods, and energy.\"\n\nLol...yes ok...\"perhaps\"\n\nAs long as the EU and other western countries remain in a coalition, what you are perhapsing about will never happen", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
