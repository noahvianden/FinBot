{"title": "Pfizer aims to save $1.5 billion by 2027 in first wave of new cost cuts ", "selftext": "Pfizer on Wednesday said it has launched a new multiyear program to reduce costs as it works to rebound from the rapid decline of its Covid business. \n\nThe announcement is in addition to another $4 billion cost-cutting effort, which Pfizer announced last year as demand for its Covid vaccine and oral drug Paxlovid slumped. \n\nIn a securities filing, the pharmaceutical giant said the first phase of its new program is focused on operational efficiencies and is expected to save the company about $1.5 billion by the end of 2027.\n\nOne-time costs related to the initial stage of cuts are expected to be about $1.7 billion, including severance for an unspecified number of laid-off employees. The company expects to record the majority of those charges this year. \n\nPfizer also expects the program to involve “product portfolio enhancements” and changes to the company’s manufacturing and supply network, a spokesperson told CNBC.\n\n“The program will focus on streamlining our ways of working, reducing complexity and increasing productivity in Pfizer Global Supply,” the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nPfizer in the filing added that “given the complexity in manufacturing and longer lead times required to make changes, this program will be a multi-phased effort.”\n\nPfizer is trying to shore up investor sentiment after its shares fell nearly 50% in 2023, making it the worst-performing pharmaceutical stock last year. That share drop erased more than $100 billion in Pfizer’s market value.\n\nAs demand for Covid products plummeted last year, Pfizer also disappointed Wall Street with the underwhelming launch of a new RSV shot, a twice-daily weight loss pill that fell short in clinical trials and an initial 2024 forecast that missed expectations.\n\nBut Pfizer pleased investors earlier this month after it reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted profit that beat expectations and hiked its full-year earnings outlook. The pharmaceutical giant said its new profit guidance accounts for its “confidence” in its business and its ability to slash costs.\n\n“We are cautiously optimistic about the year,” Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said during an earnings call on May 1.\n\nShares of the company closed 6% higher on that day. Pfizer’s stock is up nearly 14% since then.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/22/pfizer-announces-new-cost-cutting-program.html", "id": "1cy9sfn", "created_utc": 1716408094.0, "score": 98, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 58, "comments": [{"body": "I'm just gonna buy a fuckload of pfizer and eat a turtle or something to start the next plague", "score": 135, "replies": [{"body": "Go to Australia and shag some Koala bears to try to acquire a new strain of Syphilis?", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "We can eat em, just don’t fuck em.", "score": 7, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Could always fuck a pangolin", "score": 6, "replies": []}, {"body": "Dairy farmers have your back.

You also have to account for the fact that emulation is a power sucking process, as adding any abstraction layers will cause overhead for the CPU. This is especially present with programs made in cpp, as they are mostly designed to be extremely fast, but by adding any layer of abstraction you're effectively making the language higher level, and forcing the machine to work harder to process both types.\n\nIt's incredibly hard to truly measure TDP and power draw, as every OEM will have different MOBOs that allocated different amounts of power and completely different cooling. I can tell you that, in no uncertain terms, that Intel doesn't care.

The biggest hindrance is developer support for the arm architecture to take over x86.", "score": -7, "replies": [{"body": "First, I'm a CE major. Second, ARM is not fundamentally better. ARM emphasizes RISC, which makes compilers have to work significantly harder to convert code into pieces that a device can actually work with. Meanwhile, x86 with its CISC architecture can leverage stronger microcode, which allows x86 to simply run faster. CISC is also designed to be more diverse in terms of its instruction set, and since desktops, laptops, and servers are fundamentally designed for more diverse and complex tasks. Anything that is needing extremely complex math(I.e. research, code compilation, higher end media formats and encoding, running literally any engineering task, ect) just won't run as well on ARM. Now, ARM has done a great job in smaller devices, namely wearables, embedded, and mobile. This is because the chips are open for license and the RISC limitations tend not to be an issue because 1-2 companies control the entire development ecosystem. If you want to develop for an Apple watch or an iPhone, you need to use Swift(or obj-c, but, like, yuck). Pretty much anything that runs on these devices goes through a very specific process to be developed. PCs don't have this advantage. You're gonna be developing for a very wide range of hardware, and there's about 500 different languages someone can choose to develop with, and tons of different things that can ONLY run on a desktop. ARM cannot account for these use cases. Also, how do developers account for the different types of ARM chips out there? ARM chips get designed by ARM, by OEMs, by all sorts of players. Hell, if you had the money and time, you could theoretically develop an ARM chip. This creates massive differences in what exactly can run on an ARM chip, while x86 and x86-64 are pretty much universal. Intel has no control over the ecosystem, which is a point you completely overlook. Windows only develops the OS, and they have versions of Windows for things like PowerPC and DEC Alpha. They'll continue to throw devs at anything that can make them money. \n\nx86 chips do consume more power, because they are faster, but that doesn't mean they must fundamentally be more consuming. Comparing two leading chips from x86 and ARM(M3 Max and 14900HX) the two have similar TDPs and consume very similar amounts of power. These chips trade blows across the board, and for anything requiring large amounts of RAM or cache, you're gonna need an Intel chip. AMD 7945HX also has similar performance and TDP numbers. This isn't even mentioning the fact that the Apple OS has been ultra optimized for these very specific chips, or even the fact that Intel and AMD chips are running on architecture that is more than a year older than the M3 chips. \n\nx86 beat ARM in the desktop and laptop market because it was designed very specifically for this market. ARM is not. There was no \"first to the market\" advantage. While x86 did have first to the market, ARM came out with its first chip just a few years after x86, and at this point there was basically no commercially recognized standard. ARM chose to focus on smaller embedded devices, and once more developers started developing for x86, it was clear that x86 would beat ARM. However, there have been multiple players that tried to unseat x86. PowerPC is probably the most notable, with IBM and Apple both going all in on this ISA. This too was a RISC chip, with diverse software and hardware support from multiple large companies. It failed because x86 was fundamentally better. There's a reason AMD chose to back design the x86 to x86-64, and it's because it was a better choice for the company. And look now, AMD and Intel are basically the only real players in the CPU space. \n\nThe point about Apple and the M chips is basically mute. First, the company has been using the most advanced development techniques through TSMC 3nm, and they've been releasing chips way more than Intel and AMD, which both haven't released full generations since 2022, and in chipmaking world, that's a really long time. Apple also controls the software, which means they can do a lot more software optimization and tricks to make applications work better within their ecosystem.
