{"title": "META rumored to be working on becoming the AWS of AI workloads", "selftext": "Hi everyone.  So my fund has a large position in META and so, to confess, I am talking my book here.  However, facts are that Zuck will, by the end of 2024, have purchases over 350,000 Nvidia H100 AI computers and will proprietary build another 300,000 H100 equivalent compute nodes.  He has stated that here: [https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/290456847348165/](https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/290456847348165/)  Why all the AI compute?  Rumor has it (and from a very reliable source also), that META's goal here is to become the AWS (Amazon Web Services) of AI compute for all large and small companies. META currently offers their LLaMA open source language model to the developer community for AI model development.  Why open source versus closed proprietary models like ChatGTP?   Perhaps so that the ultimate developed AI workload can run on the META hyperscale worldwide redundant server network - thus explaining the massive H100 infrastructure build currently being deployed.  Proprietary language models like ChatGTP must be rented as a service and cannot be used for custom AI development instances.  Most large entities and governments will want custom AI compute, and in many cases multiple instances of AI compute for different tasks (defense, crime fighting, tax collections, etc).\n\nRemember AWS is worth, by many estimates, more than Amazon's retail e-commerce division.    What will META be worth when they are the primary provider of AI hosted infrastructure to start-ups, consumers, small and large businesses and world governments?  Probably well over $3000 per share - and this increase in share price will occur rapidly within the next 3 years should it become evident META is becoming the AWS of AI.   META remains, despite its recent massive run up, the cheapest of the mega-cap tech stocks (and in an election year advertising environment also....).\n\nSo this is still a largely secret program at META (why let potential competitors like AWS know their strategy ahead of time).
