{"title": "Nasdaq Index: A Bubble About to Burst", "selftext": "### Nasdaq Index: A Bubble About to Burst\n\nOver the past six years, I have been deeply immersed in the financial markets, conducting thorough and continuous analysis through various methods, patterns, and analytical schools. Today, I would like to share with you a bold opinion that may seem unreasonable to some, but I am confident in its accuracy: the current prices of the Nasdaq Index are merely a reflection of a massive bubble that is about to burst.\n\n#### Current Economic and Political Conditions\n\nLet's look at the broader context of recent economic and political events. Inflation in the United States has reached unprecedented levels in decades, forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates repeatedly. These rate increases lead to tighter liquidity, making financing more expensive and reducing consumer and investment spending. This has significantly impacted multiple sectors, including technology, which constitutes a large portion of the Nasdaq Index components.\n\n#### Impact of Inflation and Interest Rates\n\nHigh inflation means that living and production costs increase, reducing the ability of companies to achieve substantial profits. Technology companies, in particular, are heavily affected due to their significant reliance on cheap financing to grow their businesses. As interest rates rise, these companies' ability to borrow and grow diminishes, leading to a decline in their market value.\n\n#### Expected Scenario for the Nasdaq Index\n\nImagine this scenario: upon the Nasdaq Index reaching levels between 20,500 and 20,700 , the bubble that has inflated illogically will start to burst. This burst will lead to a dramatic drop that may reach levels between 18,400 and 18,800 in the short term. But the story does not end there. Considering potential corrections and the breaking of these supports, the drop could accelerate until the index reaches astonishing levels of approximately 16,700.\n\n#### Potential Recession and Economic Contraction\n\nThis anticipated drop is not just a number on a screen but a signal of a severe financial crisis that could ravage the American economy and leave a deep impact on global markets. Major companies will see their values shrink, leading to a loss of market confidence and increasing pressure on the entire financial system. With declining investments and rising unemployment rates, the likelihood of an economic recession and severe contraction increases.\n\nFor example, we can look at the global financial crisis of 2008, where the collapse of the housing market led to the downfall of major financial institutions and a significant rise in unemployment rates. Similarly, the economic crisis of the early 2000s, known as the dot-com bubble, saw a dramatic collapse in tech stock prices, leading to an economic recession.\n\n#### Potential Impact on the American Economy\n\nThe current situation of the Nasdaq Index clearly indicates the unsustainability of high prices. The bubble we see today is built on unrealistic expectations and inflated market values. The anticipated drop will soon confirm the accuracy of this analysis, serving as a real test of the resilience of the economy and financial markets. In this scenario, we might witness a significant economic contraction, with a sharp decline in economic activities and rising unemployment rates, putting immense pressure on both the American and global economies.\n\nTherefore, I urge you to take this analysis seriously and exercise caution in your investment strategies. The bubble is about to burst, and the major drop will come unexpectedly and swiftly.\n\nThank you, and I hope this analysis serves as an early warning for those seeking a deeper understanding of the current state of the Nasdaq Index and financial markets in general. Prepare yourselves, as the financial storm is approaching, and the upcoming events may change the face of the economy as we know it.\n\nTamer Omar, Analyst and Financial Markets Enthusiast\nDate: June 17, 2024\nTime: 21:17 PM (UTC+2)", "id": "1diaozk", "created_utc": 1718662653.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.32, "num_comments": 48, "comments": [{"body": "Your lines don’t have 3 touches.
