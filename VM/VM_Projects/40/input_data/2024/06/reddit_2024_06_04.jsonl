Hence, advertisers are more likely to reach users that want something that they might not divulge elsewhere (e.g., Facebook or Instagram).\n\nAs for getting more revenue, I think Reddit should show a lot more ads to users that are not registered. The problem for these ads is that the quality will be quite low since there is less information on the user.

These users also have a much higher level of interaction with each other, which is an engagement multiplier of several orders of magnitude.  \n\nAll this engagement results in content that Reddit can then turn around and sell for AI training and other purposes.  This is on top of the added potential for targeted ads since users have already segmented themselves into groups more likely to be interested in a particular product or service, as opposed to other social media where they more often just passively join a long list of groups that interest them, sometimes several of the same as there is no impetus to consolidate to a single group/forum for a topic such as what Reddit naturally has.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "I get it. \n\nBut why haven't they still not done so after so many years?
