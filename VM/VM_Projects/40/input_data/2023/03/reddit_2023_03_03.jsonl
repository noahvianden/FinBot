{"title": "Think loan forgiveness will cost taxpayers a lot? The Fed: \"Hold my beer.\" ---> $1T", "selftext": "**According to a policy brief by Andrew Levin and Bill Nelson, QE4 will cost taxpayers nearly a $1T over the next decade.**\n\nAndrew Levin is a professor of monetary economics at Dartmouth with numerous prior roles at the Fed board for 20 years; he also was a visiting scholar at the IMF and provided expertise or advised 14 central banks around the world.  Bill Nelson is a professor at Georgetown and chief economist of the Bank Policy Institute, with an expertise in bank liquidity.\n\nThe ample-reserves regime (floor system of managing interbank lending) of blasting banks with excess reserves seemingly worked fine during ZIRP.  However, the expense to service all this excess liquidity is *turning out to be incredibly costly*.\n\nWhere does the cost come from?  In order to service the massive liquidity created by QE4, the Fed can only control interest rates with a \"floor system\" of providing extremely generous payments to banks via reserves (IORB = interest on reserve balances) and the RRP facility aka reverse repos.  It is essentially a *bribe* to keep the federal funds rate from free-falling back to 0 or potentially even negative.\n\nThe result?  Fed will operate at a loss for the first time in history and by suspending payments to the treasury, it will cost taxpayers nearly $1T over the next decade.  \"Money printing\" with QE involves buying bonds that *eventually* mature and sucks money back from circulation.  In some sense it is a loose metaphor.  Currently, the Fed is actually printing dollars out of thin air with no oversight.\n\n**All of this done with zero warning of the magnitude of risks and zero approval by Congress.**  The beautiful part?  This doesn't even include the extra cost to taxpayers of higher rates being required to tame inflation and thereby increasing borrowing costs that are being artificially propped up.  The Fed is not alone in this reckless irresponsibility.  This is happening to every major CB across the world.\n\nhttps://www.mercatus.org/research/policy-briefs/federal-reserves-balance-sheet-costs-taxpayers\n\n**TL;DR In 2023, the Fed is creating a precedent that it can borrow unlimited funds from the American taxpayer, with no set maturity or repayment date, with zero warning to the public, discussion of benefits vs. costs, or approval from Congress.**\n\nEdit: what is the floor system?  It is a new way that the Fed, along with CB's around the world began managing interest rates during the GFC.  \n\nhttps://bpi.com/the-fed-is-stuck-on-the-floor-heres-how-it-can-get-up/", "id": "11gr23b", "created_utc": 1677817288.0, "score": 21, "upvote_ratio": 0.69, "num_comments": 44, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|7 months ago\n**Total Comments**|132|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|7 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: QE4 is costing taxpayers nearly a $1T over the next decade.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "What are you worried about? 1 trillion will be the equivalent of $100 ten years from now.
