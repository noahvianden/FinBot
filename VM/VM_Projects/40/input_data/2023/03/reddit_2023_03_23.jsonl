Bank Deposits Have Stabilized in Last Week, Powell Says", "selftext": "Deposit flows in the U.S. banking system have stabilized in the last week after a historic run on deposits at Silicon Valley Bank prompted its collapse and forced finance officials to take emergency actions to shore up the system, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday.\n\n\"We took powerful actions with Treasury and the FDIC, which demonstrate that all depositors' savings are safe,\" Powell told a news conference following the central bank's decision to raise interest rates for a ninth straight meeting despite what he acknowledged were substantial questions about the banking turmoil's impact on the economy.\n\n\"The banking system is safe. Deposit flows in the banking system have stabilized over the last week,\" Powell said.\n\nThe issue of the safety of trillions of dollars in the banking system was a key focus of questions put to Powell after the Federal Open Market Committee raised its benchmark overnight lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a range of 4.75-5.00%.\n\nIndeed, Powell opened his press conference with a preamble devoted to an assurance that the banking system is sound and officials stand ready to use \"all of our tools as needed\" to ensure it remains so.\n\nIn the case of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which also failed, Fed officials, alongside those from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, invoked emergency powers to keep all deposits at both banks whole, even those that exceeded the FDIC's $250,000-per-depositor insurance limit.\n\n\"These actions demonstrate that all depositors' savings in the banking system are safe,\" Powell said.\n\nThat said, when later asked if that meant that \"de facto deposit insurance covers all savings,\" Powell said: \"I'm not saying anything more than I'm saying.\"\n\n\"So what I'm saying is you've seen that we have the tools to protect depositors when there's a threat of serious harm to the economy,\" Powell said. \"Or to the financial system. And we're prepared to use those tools. And I think depositors should assume that their deposits are safe and secure.\"\n\nSource: [https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2023-03-22/bank-deposits-have-stabilized-in-last-week-powell-says](https://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2023-03-22/bank-deposits-have-stabilized-in-last-week-powell-says)\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that \"the banking system is safe.\" The Fed raised the rates 25 bps yesterday despite the recent banking turmoil.

{"title": "What a rollercoaster of a day… 3-23-23 SPY/ ES Futures, VIX, DXY and 10YR YIELD Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Hey guys so I have no idea what happened but some how my DaddyDersch reddit account got suspended… apparently according to mods it was set as a “spam” account or something… so im in the process of appealing and using this account for now. So u/SpyOptionaire is still me DaddyDersch aka DD.\n\n**SPY DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tawk2bw7dkpa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ec263841cf5e797e3fd7ad9b56f62cce5a3d7bc\n\nI will be the first to admit I 100% expected a decent bear day today and I expected us to see the 380s… I did not expect to see that pump today at all.\n\nToday was an absolute wild day… we had that massive morning push that led to an impressive $8+ drop today. Then the volatility from 3pm till end of day was some of the most aggressive non-macro news days I have seen… its rare to see a $5 pump in less than 5 minutes unless there is some sort of crazy macro news to support it which we did not have.\n\nThe biggest thing to note here from supply and demand is that we came up and pretty much hit 399.1 supply from two days ago and then rejected and dropped. We are still in the process of waiting for a demand (support) to be established and to find a bounce that will hold. With his retest and rejection at 399.1 supply (resistance) we once again start to eye 385.87 demand (support) as our downside target.\n\nFor me (I am still in a 29dte 392P) I am eyeing 385.87 as a take profit target or a new demand (support) to be established before SPY reaches that. IF and when we establish this demand I will close my long put and wait for the next short opportunity. There would also be a potential to play a long back to the 399 area too.\n\n**SPY DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ei9n6je8dkpa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ee71960d86c73c94333b23d0b373b7bd2ed628b\n\nFrom a daily stand point here I am watching that we attempted once again to break through the 399 daily 200ema resistance and once again were rejected. This is now the 3rd day in a row that has attempted at once point to close over 399 and failed. We also retested and rejected the daily 20ema and now closed back under the daily 8ema.\n\nMy target remains 390.1 with a bigger target down at that support near 385.8. However, as today showed the bulls are not quite done and are not quite out of this fight. As long as we remain under this black resistance line then the upside is limited and the downside has the most potential.\n\nSPY Daily Levels:Supply- 399.1 -> 405.2Demand- 385.9 -> 376.7Support- 393.1 -> 392 -> 390.1 -> 389.3 -> 385.8Resistance- 395.1 -> 397.1 -> 399\n\n**FUTURES DAILY SUPPLY AND DEMAND**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dqabt1v8dkpa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a398da908434e0a3b7155a2084e9800f7233f9a\n\nMuch like SPY futures came down and bounced off 3945 demand (support) area and also broke out and rejected almost to the penny off 4040 supply (resistance).\n\nWith this 3rd rejection in a row off 4040 supply we should recognize this as a major level going forward. From here the target remains a break through 3945 and then 3895. Until we see a new demand (support) established the case for upside is extremely limited.\n\nOnce we establish a new demand (support) then we have a long opportunity back to 4040/4055 area.\n\n**FUTURES DAILY PRICE ACTION**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/62bsika9dkpa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=13b6efb19be46bbff474826d6cbbf7ebb38660f5\n\nAccording to daily price action on futures we are still holding the recovery support line and actually have not broken this relief uptrend yet. However, that support has been broken on SPY which should lead to a break of this support on futures shortly.\n\nI also note this attempted breakout and rejection of the daily 200, 50, 100, and 20 ema today. We did technically retake the daily 8ema today.\n\nWith SPY and Futures daily dojis we should see this as a failed breakout and I still am eyeing the downside here on SPY/ futures. Ultimate target is 3920 and then 3888.\n\nI would personally not be going long on SPY/ futures until a new demand is established.\n\nFutures Daily Levels:Supply- 4040 -> 4055Demand- 3945 -> 3895 -> 3833Support- 3970 -> 3945 -> 3920 -> 3888Resistance- 3995 -> 4040 -> 4055\n\n**VIX**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bt2lxms9dkpa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf7ec2f3d9ebdce02fc4395b6907ef73c50821f6\n\nThe VIX had a pretty strong bounce today and did actually retake the daily 20ema. Now interestingly enough which has been the trend as of lately on the VIX is that we did not hold the total upside move… this once again tells me that we are seeing heavy hedges put on only for them to be take off the same day.\n\n**DXY**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/11mkos6adkpa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=51f97b5aabae478bacbe749015156cd43956e504\n\nThe dollar has continued to fall and continues to make lower lows. However, it appears we have finally found a temporary bottom with this double long wick and now morning doji star pattern. This should provide some upside lift to the dollar. If we finally see the dollar regain some strength after almost 2 straight weeks of dropping that could finally provide further downside on SPY.\n\n**10YR YIELD**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k3ienawcdkpa1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4b09b0040d6bf30ce2dee8a13525678549796e8\n\nAs of right now it appears the 10yr isn’t doing a whole lot of anything. IT did close another lower low however this 3.395% to 3.433% area appears to be a strong “support” area on the 10yr.\n\n**DAILY TRADING LOG**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/al1rpeaddkpa1.png?width=774&format=png&auto=webp&s=a24b23cdc3ed36698363360bb417ec36a7d0d895\n\nI wont even lie I was 100% wrong on today but despite being wrong I was able to turn out one heck of a green day today going 8 for 8 today and cashing in about $1300 in realized profits! Not a bad day if I don’t say so myself.
