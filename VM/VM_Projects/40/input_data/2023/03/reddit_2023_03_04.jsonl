Stocks go up? Buy.\n\nI personally believe the bond market. Inflation is feeding off any positive data and the cost of borrowing is just now starting to affect things. The half billion dollar default by blackstone (thanks for edit) related to commercial real estate is just the first one. They defaulted because they couldn't issue a big enough bond at a favorable rate. So the rate hikes that started a year ago are starting to work their way into the banking system and economy.\n\nThe fed can't stop until inflation goes down. They can't taper simply because people want stocks to rally, the US dollar itself is on the line here. \n\nAuto loan defaults are going back to where they were in 2019 and are on pace to break through. Mortgage demand for homes is pushing lower. The risk premium on stocks is in the death zone. The tight labor market is the only thing keeping things afloat, because people are still spending, largely on credit. It just feels like the spring is wound up tight and even a small increase in unemployment will cause an avelanche of defaults and earnings declines.\n\nI see the economy as being based on bonds and access to financing. When those things become scarce, the economy goes into recession. We're just entering a phase of tighter lending standards. People saying to go long right now believe we hit the bottom and it's clear skies ahead. The market has never bottomed during a fed tightening cycle. Only after.

The Fed has helped to destroy the value of the dollar since it's inception.  Also JPow has already suggested possibly raising the target inflation rate to 3% which I take as an admission that he may not think we can get below that level without damaging the economy and/or financial system.\n\nThat being said, I do agree that they'll tighten more.  I think they tighten as much as they think they can without blowing things up.  With their track record, I'm betting they blow things up first then ease policy more than we've ever seen before.\n\nTrue they wont ease just to juice the stock market and make people happy.
