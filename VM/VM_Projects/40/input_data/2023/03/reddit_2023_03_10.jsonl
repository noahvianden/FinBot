Also worth noting, this comes from the perspective of someone in their early 20s. So I have a bit of time to let it play out, and have more of a risk appetite.\n\n**Pros**\n\nOne of the reasons I like Google is because, as more of the world comes online for the first time, there's a good chance they'll use a Google product or service. As of January 2023 [64% of the world is online](https://www.statista.com/statistics/617136/digital-population-worldwide/). Meaning there are currently 3+ billion people that do not have internet. You could argue the same thing for Microsoft. Won't more people coming online mean more people buying Windows subscriptions? Yes, that is true. But I would argue that user acquisition is much easier for Google, as nearly all of their services are free. So these new users will become new eyeballs for advertisers. \n\nAnother reason I like Google, is the subsidiaries that their parent company Alphabet holds. More specifically Waymo and DeepMind. **In my opinion,** driverless cars will be big in the future. Google may not win this race, but they have a headstart. Their driverless taxi is already operating in some locations in the U.S. Still a long way off, but it has the potential to be a large revenue stream in the future. Google Deepmind is also interesting. I'm sure you have heard about ChatGPT and how Microsoft integrating it into Bing will be a Google \"killer\". While ChatGPT is impressive I don't think it is enough to kill Google (**I could be wrong**). There is quite the A.I. hype right now and Google Deepmind is a good contender. They have made major accomplishments over the last decade, that a lot of people in the ML field did not think was possible for many more decades. Mainly [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo), [AlphaStar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaStar_(software)) (StarCraft 2), and [AlphaFold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaFold)(protein folding). \n\n**Cons**\n\nThe biggest con I have with Google is that their advertising revenue makes up nearly 80% of their total revenue. Meaning if something were to happen to their advertising business, such as more regulations being passed, it could severely affect revenue. That is why I am *hoping* that they can diversify their revenue more. Whether that be through Google cloud or one of their subsidiaries above making it big. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry about the wall of text. I ended up writing a bit more than I intended.
