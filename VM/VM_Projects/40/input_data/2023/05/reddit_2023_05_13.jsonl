{"title": "PACW: Screwed or Not? A look at the numbers with help from Security Analysis (1934) (tldr $3.7 lots of risk)", "selftext": "tldr: \\~$3.7/share floor assuming they keep all the insured depositors but could still dip below that (and did on May 4th) and you could get FDICked\n\n# Background\n\nOn the afternoon of April 28th I was pondering how my cheap FRC 65C 5/19 purchased a week before could have gone so wrong when I remembered something from listening to the entire audiobook of Security Analysis (1934): Companies are valuable by assets they have or profits they can generate. An asset-rich but unprofitable company can potentially be turned around, or liquidated at a profit if share price falls low enough. An asset-poor but profitable (or soon to be profitable) company will become wealthier as long as dividends are not too high. FRC was a puddle of toxic financial waste that was losing money every quarter from assets that were net negative in value (deposit / asset mismatch) and the FDIC had to fill in 13 billion for JPM to take the deal. The earnings that came out on the 24th made it very clear there was no way to get some kind of positive value out of the company for anyone. I bought 1P 5/19 at 45 cents, which sold the next week after receivership for 80 cents and made me slightly positive on the whole ordeal.\n\nPACW is a regional bank in a precarious state. They are next in line after FRC in terms of sentiment, stock price collapse, and news of deposits fleeing. They are [drawn in to Burry's chart in scary red letters](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/11ub295/michael_burrys_chart_for_banks_with_regard_to/) which is obviously very bearish too. However, they are in at the 60% uninsured deposit / 35% unrealized CET1 losses zone which is far lower than (redacted <500M bank), Silvergate, and First Republic. Regional banks are now literal reverse meme stocks where volatility and sentiment can cause the deposit outflows that cause asset-liability mismatch and kill the bank's profitability or even solvency. PACW's 2031 bond is 40 cents on the dollar, showing severe lack of confidence in their survival. Without a surprise injection of capital or sudden rate cut, their outlook is gloomy until enough of their loans renew at a higher rate and/or rates go down enough to take pressure off their interest margin, probably sometime in or after 4Q 2023. They are also trying to sell their Lender Finance arm for 2.7B but it seems to be taking a while to close. The common dividend was cut last week from 25 cents to 1 cent, which was actually pretty well received on Monday, but the effect didn't last, and the dividend was announced late on Friday night. They announced they were looking at \"strategic options\" which seemed to have a mostly downward effect as they're clearly looking but haven't made a deal. They are certainly still a solvent bank, but how much should the stock be worth, and what happens if more deposits leave?\n\n# Analysis\n\nPACW is still generating a profit from their deposits, but it has shrunk as deposits left and interest rates rose. Another lesson from Security Analysis is to remember who gets paid and in what order: bonds, preferred shares, common stock. Usually companies are either profitable and everyone gets paid or fail and the bond holders fight over the scraps, but sometimes it can land in the middle. I'm going to focus on the common stock. Here is the current situation from yesterday's 10Q:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Description|Value|Note|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|Q1 2023 earnings available to common|80 million|In the 10Q they have some goodwill impairment thing going on that makes Q1 look like a massive loss, this is after ignoring that and some layoff costs.|\n|Q1 2023 earnings for common annualized|320 million||\n|Number of common shares|123 million|200M authorized|\n|Price at 10x earnings for Q1 2023|3.2B, or $26/share|The stock was around $27/share in February|\n||||\n|Mar 31 Net Interest Margin|2.89%|This is the majority of their revenue. The margin drops as they lose low-cost deposits. Down from 3.43.|\n|Mar 31 deposits|28 billion|Down 5.7 billion (16.9% in Q1)|\n|Mar 31 uninsured deposit %|29%|Down from 52% on Dec 31|\n|Mar 31 uninsured deposits|8.12 billion||\n||||\n|May 4-5 deposit drop|Down 9.5%|Holy shit bro they lost 10% in 24 hours. tbh I'd leave if I was uninsured too.|\n|May 10 uninsured deposits|5.2 billion|Losing 9.5% of 28B entirely from 8.12B uninsured would be 5.46B remaining, but they probably lost some in April too so the numbers aren't exact|\n|May 10 immediate liquidity|15 billion|If the rest of the uninsured deposits panic they can cover it at least, although it means more asset-liability mismatch|\n|Deposits if all uninsured leave|20.12 billion|Mar 31 - 9.5% - 5.2B|\n|Reduction in deposits times reduced NIM|\\-229 million|(28-20.12)\\*-0.029. This is the loss to yearly revenue from yield on deposits.|\n|Earnings for common with above reduction|91 million or 22.75 million per quarter|Worth nothing this is 18.5 cents per share quarterly. That 25c dividend isn't coming back.|\n|**Price at 10x earnings**|**910M, or $7.4/share**|**This is around the recent peak. This would be what the price would stabilize to after a few months.**|\n|**Price at 5x earnings**|**455M, or $3.7/share**|**I found some old paper that said during the GFC banks were valued at more like 5x earnings. This is also the recent low.**|\n||||\n|Insured deposit outflow required to wipe out common earnings|\\-3.5B or remaining insured deposits 16.62B|Assuming all uninsured deposits also leave. It is the remaining earnings for common 91M divided by 0.026 (a reduced NIM).|\n|% Drop from current estimated 25B deposits to wipe out common earnings|\\-33.5%|Basically, if they lose another 1/3 of deposits the stock is only worth the possibility of future recovery.|\n||||\n\nKind of freaked me out that the analysis came out close to the recent high for the optimistic case and recent low for the cautious case. It's all priced in???. I decided to focus on the earnings available to common since that's where the option plays and massive swings are. The preferred stock is paying a 20% dividend if that's your thing, but know that if they lose profitability on the common the preferred follows very soon after.\n\nGraham and Dodd would tell you to seriously consider the bonds or preferred shares too since they get paid first and a near-certain 40% is much better than an unlikely 3x. I don't have access to good bond data so I would appreciate if someone can explain why their bonds are trading at 40 cents.\n\nFor the common stock, Graham and Dodd would insist on a considerable margin of safety for any purchase. Probably in the $2 - $2.7 per share range, if at all with the risk of further deposit flight and receivership. They would probably also look at other regional banks like WAL that are in the crosshairs but have stronger positions and leave PACW alone until their future became more certain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Conclusion\n\nI have seen generally bearish sentiment about PACW as bullish as the general sentiment about FRC the week before earnings, in some cases even switching to being a PACW bear to make up for FRC losses (wrong inverse dummies, the weaker banks fail first). So I do expect some loss porn with short strike puts as well as some overly optimistic calls. Also, if PACW falls below $4.06/share (500M mkt cap) then we will not be able to discuss it anymore lmao.\n\nThere seems to be a mismatch in that there is still a demand for loans from these regional banks but not enough interest in deposits to fund those loans. The model of 5 - 30 years loans but deposits that can leave anytime doesn't work with rates rising this fast. That could mean a massive liquidity crunch in real estate loans but that's another topic entirely and maybe even wouldn't be a bad thing long term if it corrects commercial / multifamily RE prices.\n\nThe risk and amount (per share) of potential loss is significantly less with a low entry point, so perhaps sell CSP at $3 or below. All things considered, this is a very borderline bank and its survival basically hinges on the insured depositors sticking around, very slow rate hikes or a rate cut, and no further major unrealized losses to the assets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Positions\n\nMy positions: I am holding a \"don't know shit about fuck\" spread. Only started with options last week so positions are small until my hubris grows. IBKR is on maintenance or something so no screenshots, but here it is from memory.\n\n|PACW 100 shares @ 6.1 purchased May 10.|\n|:-|\n|Short 8C Jan15 2025 @ 2.98 sold May 10 (buy write with the shares).|\n|Long 3P Sep 2023 @ 1.4 bought May 12 (receivership insurance lmao)|\n\nOn May 10 I figured \"Either they're fine and they will surge past 8 and I get to collect $300 premium + $200 profit when I eventually get assigned, or they're going to take a while to recover but at least I'll have a $3 cost basis when the call expires in 19 months\".
