{"title": "Navigating the Bull: Seeking Advanced Strategies for My Deep ITM MSFT Covered Call Position", "selftext": "Hello, esteemed r/options community! A few months ago, I sought your invaluable insights about managing my complex covered call (CC) trade and was truly impressed by the quality and creativity of the responses. My MSFT shares and CC strategy have been doing wonders, and I'm back for more advice!\n\nTo recap, I own 1900 shares of MSFT and have been successfully running a covered call strategy for the past couple of years, generating a good stream of passive income. Following best practices, I set a 45DTE, target 20-30 delta, and manage out at 10 delta or 21DTE or when the strike price is breached. \n\nThis year, MSFT has been on a relentless bull run, and I've been continuously rolling out and up from $250. My CC stack is now 19 options deep with a strike price of $285, expiring 9/21. However, the fast-climbing price has left me deep in the money. The option price is at $57, far above my original premium of $5.\n\nDespite this, I'm keen on holding my shares (cost basis at $150), considering the capital gains implications. While the trade has worked out exceptionally well for my stock position, I'm now facing a challenge on how best to manage this option stack.\n\nI'm sure many of you have navigated such complex scenarios and I'm eager to hear your suggestions. How do I find the right roll here? What are the best practices for a situation like this, especially when you're this deep in the money? Any and all ideas are welcome. \n\nRemember, this isn't just about avoiding losses, it's about learning, strategizing, and making the most of our options!\n\nThanks in advance for your help, fellow traders.\n\n[Link to previous thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/tj56z7/have_570k_1900_shares_of_msft_pls_advice_on_good/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1)", "id": "13tjy1b", "created_utc": 1685226158.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 43, "comments": [{"body": "It gets said over and over again but people continue to think there’s some magic to rolling. Do not sell puts on stocks you wouldn’t be ok being assigned on at that price and do not sell covered calls on stocks you wouldn’t be ok getting called away. \n\nIf you continue to roll, you run the risk of riding MSFT all the way back down just to avoid getting the shares called away. Let’s put some numbers to it using what you provided. You’re long 1900 shares from $150, for a profit of $347,491 with MSFT at 332.89. You’re short the 285c from $5, which are now worth $57, for a loss of $98,800. If you close everything out, your profit is $248,691. \n\nNow let’s say you roll it up and out to the June 2024 315c. In the meantime the US goes into a recession and MSFT retraces back to where it was at the beginning of 2023 around $240. Well congrats now your calls have expired worthless so you have no loss on the options but your stock position is now only up $171,000. So you’ve managed to avoid taxes on your stocks but your profit is roughly $79k lower. \n\nThe point being, you need to know what you’re getting into selling covered calls and be ok with the stock getting called away. You’re literally trading the upside of the stock in exchange for the premiums. That’s the trade off. By rolling you have to be sure that the stock is going to continue to go up, otherwise you’re simply trying to avoid a loss in the options while opening yourself up to losses by holding the underlying. You already sold the upside when you sold the covered calls, you can’t always magically roll your way into not having sold them in the first place. Sometimes rolling works out, sometimes it doesn’t.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "☝️.

Right now you’re in max profit for a covered call meaning you’re above the strike. If you hold to expiration, you’ll make another $17,309 as those 285 calls go to intrinsic. So basically you’ve made $248,691 and can make as much as another $17,309 unless you roll for a credit. Another way to say that is you’re risking $248,691 to make $17,309, about a 7% is ROI. Whether or not that risk is worth it to you is your call. Rolling for a credit can increase that potential ROI but also lengthens the timeframe and the chances that MSFT retraces. In the end, it’s just what you want to risk. The one thing you can’t do is look at it and say “wow if I had never sold those calls my profit would have been $347,491” and try to roll your way to that profit. That’s setting yourself up for failure. Selling covered calls means accepting possible lower returns for lower variance and steady incomes from premium.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "\nThank you for your thoughtful response and insights. Regarding the statement about risking $248,691 to make $17,309, my goal is to retain my stocks for long term and utilize covered calls to generate additional profits (until shares get called away) whenever possible. so these profits from stock appreciation may just be paper profits in a way for me unless I am forced to sell when exercised. So I have just been focused on the CC and been managing for diff scenarios. \n\nSo in this case, one option I have is to wait until 21 DTE, and then keep rolling up and out if price stays above strike price . And while this burns the time, at some point market is going to retrace for the Cc to break even etc. so wondering if there are any other options to manage just the CC part of the trade here \n\nIn 2021 wild run, I was in similar situation where I rode it from $200 to $350 with my CC in very deep in the money for a while and finally broke even when market started retracing though it took many months.

I was simply pointing out the risks you’re taking in order to avoid selling your shares and paying taxes.

Cons of this is obviously you're locking in a net loss and keeping exposure to downside to the shares post trade but if you are attempting to keep all your shares to prevent short term gain tax, this is a way to do it. You also remove the chance that the stock falls to just above your CC strike after you place the trade as there is always a risk the price falls after you convert. Buy a call at the same expiry as your CC that is above your current strike will do this. Best would be timing a bottom as close to expiry as possible to reduce premium and cost of the bought call.\n\nBut honestly, it's prob just better to allow your shares to be called away as it frees up so much more capital so you can sell puts to continue wheeling, esp if you think the share price should continue higher.

Sure, there are shysters and garbage companies out there ~~paying lawyers~~ using Chat GPT to draw up the paperwork to go public and fleece the greedy and the ignorant. But the changes AI is bringing to the world are going to be more bigger, more fundamentally daily life changing, and faster than all the changes that happened during the Information Age.  \n\n\nThe real key to understanding what a watershed moment Chat GPT and other generative AI technology out there to the general public is this:  \n\n\nThe information age brought about **sharing information** at 0 marginal cost.   \n\n\nThe AI age is bringing about **generation of knowledge** at 0 marginal cost.  \n\n\nGo ahead and tell me, \"AI can't do anything, it can only rearrange things.\" or \"Yeah, but it isn't 100% right all the time.\" First, that's what humans do. Second, when are humans 100% right all the time anyway? Whether or not AI is generating original information doesn't really belong in this sub. But **it is uncontestable that AI can generate new information right now.** \n\nOver time, AI will get better and genuinely produce new knowledge. But the producing of new knowledge isn't the earth shattering part. I can go out and make a baby with someone and essentially create a new data processing machine. The revolutionary part, **the truly revolutionary part is that you can build these machine minds to solve problems for you at scale.**\n\nGo listen to the $NVDA call and you'll hear NVDA explain that businesses are buying chips to build out these scalable machine brains. Remember all those conference calls where companies were saying \"AI\" on their calls to get a stock price boost?\n\nWas some of it nonsense? Yes.\n\nHowever, **we're about an earnings season or two away from one of those companies who said they were using new AI tech to improve their business to announce that it actually worked.** There is going to be one company, the first company that goes on their earnings call and says \"Due to AI we have unexpectedly high profits and are raising full year guidance.\" \n\n**That will be the tipping point, and it is as few as 3 months away.**\n\nI'm not going to sit here and pretend to know which company is going to make that announcement. I don't. Nor do I have the time to sift through enough earnings calls to figure it out, though I wish I did. It's going to be a company with obvious uses for AI, and probably more focused on a company who that uses lots of brainpower like an engineering or coding company. Possibly something in the service sector.\n\nThe moment corporate America figures out how to do significantly more with significantly less labor by using AI, it will. And GDP is going to explode.\n\nThere have been so many ideas and \"revolutions\" that were going to change everything. They all promised that change was just around the corner.   \n\n\nThe AI boom is different.

However, here are some common statements or beliefs that investors might express or encounter in the period leading up to a stock market bubble:\n\n1. \"This time is different\": Investors may believe that the market has entered a new era or paradigm shift, making traditional indicators or valuation metrics less relevant. They may argue that technological advancements, regulatory changes, or other factors have fundamentally altered the investment landscape.\n2. \"The market will keep going up\": Investors may become overly optimistic and believe that the upward trend in stock prices will continue indefinitely. They may dismiss signs of overvaluation or ignore potential risks, assuming that any market correction will be short-lived or insignificant.\n3. \"It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\": Some investors may perceive an extraordinary opportunity for massive gains and fear missing out on potential profits. This fear of missing out (FOMO) can lead to increased speculative behavior and a willingness to take on higher levels of risk.\n4. \"Valuations don't matter anymore\": Investors might downplay the importance of traditional valuation measures, such as price-to-earnings ratios or price-to-book ratios. They may argue that new valuation models or metrics should be used to justify high stock prices, often relying on future growth prospects or non-financial factors.\n5. \"Everyone is making money\": As the market euphoria builds, investors may feel encouraged by stories of friends, colleagues, or acquaintances making substantial profits in the market. This \"herd mentality\" can contribute to a sense of invincibility and encourage more investors to join the speculative frenzy.\n6. \"I can't lose\": Overconfidence can take hold as investors experience a series of successful trades or investments. This overconfidence bias can lead to increased risk-taking and a disregard for proper risk management strategies.\n7. \"Ignore the naysayers\": Skepticism or warnings from market analysts, economists, or experienced investors may be disregarded or labeled as pessimistic. Investors caught up in the excitement of a bubble may dismiss contrary opinions and choose to focus solely on bullish narratives.\n\nIt's important to recognize that these statements are not necessarily accurate or indicative of the market's future trajectory.
