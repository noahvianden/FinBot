{"title": "USD is bleeding out - Linkin Park", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0l1q9bqq0ata1.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2978917e1a6eb1a2a723b4c65ce533c609b12f7\n\n**The Soviet empire started to  crumble around 1989. The time period between the forming of the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in the late 1940s and the retreat of  Russia from Eastern Europe with the eventual collapse of communism in  Russia is known as the Cold War. There was a great power confrontation  in Europe that did not result in war.**\n\n**Essentially, US-led NATO stood its ground to prevent further Soviet  expansion from the territory it occupied at the end of World War II and  waited for the inevitable collapse. Now, perhaps not everyone saw the  collapse of the Soviet empire as inevitable. But all one had to do was  view the Soviet empire for oneself, up close and personal, which is what  I did in the early 1970s as a young Air Force officer.**\n\n#### The State of the Communist Economy\n\n**The Russian economy at that time is painful to describe. Moscow and  Leningrad (Saint Petersburg), the so-called jewels of the Soviet Union,  were depressing. Everything was shoddily built. There were very few cars  on the streets. There were no retail shops deserving of the name. Lines  formed in the middle of the night awaiting the opening of the few  bakeries. I saw this for myself from my hotel window on the Nevsky  Prospekt in Leningrad. GUM, the “world’s largest department store” near  Moscow’s Red Square, sold nothing that was equal to what could be found  in any garage sale in the West.**\n\n**Actually, that should not be a surprise since at one time all those  garage-sale goods were marketable. I did not visit Berlin, but those who  did say that crossing the Brandenburg Gate from West Berlin to East  Berlin was shocking. The very idea that the Soviet economy and lifestyle  was in any way superior was ludicrous. It took brutal police power and  the infamous Berlin Wall to prevent mass exodus to the West.**\n\n#### The Peaceful Collapse of the Soviet Empire\n\n**I’m sure that life only got worse in the years between my visit to  the Soviet Union in the early 1970s until its final collapse. And the  collapse occurred without a shot fired between the Great Powers. The  collapse came very quickly and without warning. Author** [**Amity Shlaes**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amity_Shlaes) **was a reporter for the** ***Wall Street Journal Europe*** **at the time.**\n\n**Returning to New York from Berlin, Shlaes called her boss between  planes in London and was told to return to Berlin. Something was  happening. She told her boss that she had just left Berlin and that  nothing was happening. Her boss told her to go back for a few days  anyway. She did as ordered and witnessed the German people tearing down  that despicable insult to humanity.**\n\n#### How the US Enforces the American Empire\n\n**The American empire is not enforced by walls with armed guards to  prevent its citizens from escaping but, instead, by the almighty dollar.  Since the enthronement of the dollar as a reserve currency in 1944 at  the Bretton Woods conference and then the establishment of the  petrodollar in the early 1970s, almost all international trade has been  conducted in dollars. Thusly, dollars are held by every country’s  central bank to settle international trade flows. Alasdair Macleod of** [**Goldmoney**](https://www.goldmoney.com/)  **calculates that foreigners hold around $31.8 trillion in US  liabilities, of which $5.8 trillion is held by “official” institutions. (**[**Refer**](https://ticdata.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/slt2d.txt) **to US Treasury International Capital** [**figures**](https://ticdata.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/bltype.txt)**.)**\n\n**But the US has abused this “special privilege” by printing dollars  out of thin air. It has funded its empire of hundreds of bases worldwide  with excess dollars. Furthermore, it has enforced compliance with its  expansionist foreign policy by freezing dollar accounts held by foreign  central banks, foreign businesses, and foreign individuals whom it  dislikes. By cutting them out of the international financial messaging  system known as SWIFT, it has created great hardship on nations held to  be offensive to the US.**\n\n#### Today the Roles Are Reversed\n\n**But these nations have discovered America’s Achilles’ heel and are  doing something about it. The almighty dollar rests on a base of sand  known as fiat money, which is not redeemable in a desirable commodity  such as gold or silver. This characteristic has led to inflation of the  dollar over the past fifty years at an ever-accelerating rate. Such  inflation causes the exchange value of the dollar to shrink.**\n\n**Since President Richard Nixon took the US off what was left of the  gold standard in the fall of 1971, the dollar’s value against gold has  shrunk by 98 percent. No one believes that this debasement will end or  even slow down. In fact, the US seems determined to accelerate the  dollar’s depreciation to pay for its military adventures and expanding  welfare programs. Combining the debasement of the dollar with the trade  sanctions has created an intolerable situation for those currently in  America’s bad graces.**\n\n**But these nations are countering American hegemony by deploying their  own arsenal—not nuclear weapons but gold. Like America and NATO during  the Cold War, these nations are standing their ground and arming  themselves with an alternative and better reserve currency; i.e., a  currency backed by gold and to be used at least initially for settling  international trade.**\n\n**Russia has been working on the framework of a new trade settlement  currency for quite some time, and now China and others—such as Iran,  India, Brazil, and South Africa—are joining the project. There is  nothing nefarious per se about establishing an alternative trade  settlement system. One may call it rational self-interest.**\n\n**It is a peaceful project, but its results may be devastating for  countries that depend upon a stable dollar. Those who join the new  system will no longer need to hold dollars. This fall in the demand to  hold dollars will lead to an inevitable fall in its purchasing power,  perhaps even to its total collapse. This could happen literally  overnight and without warning, just like the fall of the Berlin Wall.**\n\n#### Blinded by Fallacious Ideologies\n\n**Of course, no one in a position of power in the US understands  anything about real money and real finance. They are blinded by the  promise of Keynesian economics and modern monetary theory, which posits  that creating aggregate demand (Keynesianism) funded by massive money  printing (modern monetary theory) is the sure path to economic progress.  They fail to acknowledge that the steady fall in the purchasing power  of the dollar and the rise of an alternative trade settlement system are  the inevitable consequences of their blindness.**\n\n**I see nothing that can stop the continued debasement of the dollar,  now coupled with arrogant and harmful financial sanctions, that will  prevent the peaceful establishment of an alternative international  reserve currency and all the consequences that it will bring to an  unprepared US-dominated world.**", "id": "12io16j", "created_utc": 1681228100.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.35, "num_comments": 49, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|4 weeks ago\n**Total Comments**|1|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 weeks|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n>TL;DR: The dollar's role as the reserve currency is collapsing, because the dollar is being debased at an accelerating rate.
