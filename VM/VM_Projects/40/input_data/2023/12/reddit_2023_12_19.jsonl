{"title": "Central bank must make sure ‘we don’t give people price stability but take away jobs,’ says San Francisco Fed president", "selftext": "[WSJ - Fed Official Says Rate Cuts Could Be Needed Next Year to Prevent Overtightening](https://www.wsj.com/economy/central-banking/fed-official-says-rate-cuts-could-be-needed-next-year-to-prevent-over-tightening-29d009ce)\n\n* A Federal Reserve official said it is appropriate for the central bank to begin looking ahead to lowering interest rates in 2024 because of how inflation has improved this year.\n\n* San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said her outlook for interest rates and inflation was “very close” to the median of projections from 19 Fed officials last week. Most of them penciled in at least three rate cuts next year amid a faster decline in inflation than they anticipated.\n\n* Daly said that if inflation continues its steady decline of recent months, the Fed’s benchmark interest rate “will still be quite restrictive even if we [cut rates] three times next year.”\n“We’re acknowledging progress when progress is there,” Daly said in an interview Monday.\n\n\n\nDaly said she is watching the effect that restrictive policy has on the labor market. When the unemployment rate starts to rise, it tends to go up by a lot and not by only a little bit, Daly said. As a result, “we have to be forward looking and make sure that we don’t give people price stability but take away jobs.”\n\nDaly said she thought interest-rate policy was in a “good place” to achieve that result. In a notable shift, she said the Fed’s focus now needed to turn toward paying attention to both sides of its mandate. \n\n“There is more work to do, and at this point, that work includes not only focusing on bringing inflation down to 2%…but also recognizing that we want to continue to do this gently, with as few disruptions to the labor market as possible,” she said.\n\nGovernment data released last week indicated very mild inflation in November as measured by the central bank’s preferred inflation gauge, which the Commerce Department will release on Friday. The figures suggest inflation excluding volatile food and energy costs will reach or even dip below 2% on a six-month annualized basis, and the 12-month rate could drop to 3.1% in November. The Fed targets 2% annual inflation.\n\nDaly said rate cuts would be appropriate to prevent inflation-adjusted or “real” rates from rising by holding nominal rates steady as inflation declines. Allowing real rates to increase would create an elevated possibility “that we could overtighten quite easily, and so that’s what I’m mindful of,” said Daly, who will become a voter on the Fed’s rate-setting committee next year.\n\nStocks surged and bond yields tumbled last week after the Fed held interest rates steady and officials projected three rate cuts for 2024. While Fed Chair Jerome Powell said it was too early to say the central bank was done raising rates, he fueled a rally when he also volunteered that officials were preparing to focus on when to lower rates.\n\nHis comments sent investors in interest-rate futures markets to increase their bets on earlier and deeper rate cuts next year.\n\nThe Fed last raised its benchmark federal-funds rate in July to a range between 5.25% and 5.5%, a 22-year high, to combat inflation.\n\nDaly said it was too soon to speculate at which meetings the Fed might change its policy stance next year. “Right now, I’m really focused on how well things have evolved in 2023,” she said.\n\nWhile much of the initial decline in inflation this summer stemmed from supply-chain healing, more recent declines appear to have been driven by a cooling in demand-driven components, she said.\n\nA model maintained by the San Francisco Fed suggests two thirds of the decline in core inflation had been related to changes in demand. “To me, that’s a material development,” said Daly. “That means we have monetary policy working.”\n\nDaly said it was possible inflation could show greater signs of persistence in the months ahead and that the economic outlook could shift in a way that would call for the Fed to keep rates higher for longer. On the other hand, inflation could decline more rapidly or the labor market could weaken more meaningfully than it has, justifying easier policy, she said.", "id": "18lpyjk", "created_utc": 1702950451.0, "score": 49, "upvote_ratio": 0.81, "num_comments": 48, "comments": [{"body": "That's how WSJ wanted it to sound not what Daly or the Fed has ever said.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System has been given a dual mandate—pursuing the economic goals of maximum employment and price stability. https://www.stlouisfed.org/in-plain-english/the-fed-and-the-dual-mandate\n\nThe reason is that an economy in which people who want to work either have a job or are likely to find one fairly quickly and in which the price level (meaning a broad measure of the price of goods and services purchased by consumers) is stable https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary-policy-what-are-its-goals-how-does-it-work.htm", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "WSJ truly going to shit", "score": 3, "replies": []}, {"body": ">“we have to be forward looking and make sure that we don’t give people price stability but take away jobs.”\n\nApologies, I didn't hear the interview directly where she said this but it seems quite clear exactly what she means?

So it is trading just below what I am estimating based on the median/average performance over the last decade. That’s using a 15% discount rate and 6 different methods to project owners earnings per share out 10 years. \n\nROE is way too high, average of 68% and median of 65% over the last decade because they’re buying back shares and also increasing debt, so I brought it down to a realistic level by including debt and current portion of long term debt to the equity base. It’s more of ROIC than ROE, but it’s all I can do to normalize returns against equity. I could take it a step further and back out share buybacks to lower owners earnings as well, but I haven’t gone that far at this point, and it looks okay to me just adding debt and shareholders equity.\n\nPrice is only half the equation though.

My approach to investing involves a lot of reading, and a lot of waiting. It’s more boring than anything exciting, except it is a good psychological boost when you’re looking at a 90% return in 9 months. But this is hardly the standard to expect. I analyze companies for a living for a financial institution, so it’s just second nature for me to go through the reports and analyze the business and go through some methods/check lists. If I wasn’t in Banking, or didn’t know accounting, I think id stick to index funds. But like anything else, the more you do it the better you get at it. And if you’re naturally inclined, such as being analytically minded, and on top of that you enjoy it (not a chore) then you can really blow through it with ease. Not everyone is built that way, and that’s okay. I’m more machine than man. Honestly a blessing and curse.

Any free-ish resources that you suggest for a lay person to get started? I mean books, online courses, specific domains of study, educational youtube channels?", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Probably any accounting 101 or CFA study material would help. Fluency in accounting, as well as understanding balance sheets, income statements, and statements of cash flows. Cash flow statements are a very important concept to follow, and personally I put more reliance on them than the income statement which I still look at, but have less that I’m specifically looking for. Also understanding financial ratios such as turnover, liquidity ratios, solvency ratios, probability and growth ratios, and what they means. Some are more meaningful for specific companies because of the balance sheet mix. Like, a heavy inventory company might never have a 1:1 or higher quick ratio, because so much capital is tied up in their inventory cash conversion cycle, so it may be appropriate to apply a current ratio which takes inventory into account. \n\nSo you gotta understand the nature of the underlying company, and you’ve gotta understand what tools are appropriate the job. Little bit more than just knowing how to read financials I guess. \n\nTo provide some tips, when I look at the balance sheet for example, I’m looking at cash relative to current and long term debt, if they have long term debt I want to see how much and whether or not it’s shrinking the company equity base and distorting ROE making the returns against the shrink equity look better than they really are. I’m also looking to see what equity has done over time, and the number of outstanding shares whether there’s dilution or value enhancement over the last decade or so. I also look at retained earnings over assets and net intangibles to see how much of the balance sheet has been self financed over time, although you’d already know this by the side of the long term debt. \n\nLooking at long term and short term debt over cash flow from operations is a way better solvency measure than debt to tangible net worth, because hardly any company repays debt with equity, so a well-financed and conservatively company should have no more than 5 years to payoff debt from operations. That will provide way better leverage capacity than looking at debt to TNW, especially if the company has assets that are not maintained and wouldn’t sell for much above scrap value. Equity can be very deceiving. \n\nCash flow from operations is very important, and it’s key to see if this is being driven by NOI (maybe sales increased, maybe expenses or cost of sales lowered) or to see if accounts receivable collection improved, inventory declines, or other factors are driving an increase in operational cash flow. It takes into account cash from the balance sheet as well as from revenues. It’s like looking into the gearbox of a company, how it actually works. What the sources and uses of cash are. \n\nYou can find out very quickly by looking at a statement of cash flows and a balance sheet if a company is junk or not, if they’re diluting shareholders, how they’re sourcing their cash, whether it’s from operations, cash and billing management, investment strategies, or through the issuance of debt or shares. \n\nI pretty much just rely on the income statement for revenue growth trends and margins. But I find cash flow over revenue as a much more meaningful margin than cost of sales or NOI margins. If I see cash flow margin has increased or decreased, and once I find out why, I can find out a lot more about a company than from the income statement can tell. \n\nPay attention to ROE, ROIC, and ROA. More specifically, what the average and medians are over 10 year periods. The reason why you don’t want to go longer, say 30 years to average over, is because a full business cycle tends to occur in about 7-10 years. A lot can change from cycle to cycle, you can have a completely different industry or company or some paradigm shift, kind of like what Covid and 2020-2022 represents. A lot of companies will look a lot different in the next 7 years than they did pre-COVID because of inflation, it’s similar to when you compare the minimum wage or cost of something trivial to what it was in the 1980’s. There’s been a complete paradigm shift or two since. \n\n\nA company giving out a long term ROIC of 8%, will likely only be able to providing you a return of 8%, unless you buy when it is heavily discounted. A company with high ROE might have high debt, high dividend payments, or some very positive underlying factors driving efficiently high returns against equity, say 15%+. So accounting does create distortions that you must be familiar with. Inflation for example speeds up turnover ratios depending on inventory accounting methods, so it looks like a company is speeding up when really it’s just inflation being picked up in the numbers like a seismograph. \n\nFor the same reasons as ROIC, a company that cannot consistently providing meaningful ROE or ROIC of 15% won’t provide meaningful returns to keep you ahead of taxes and inflation in the long run. So, you generally want to make sure a company has consistently generated meaningful returns against the price it paid for its assets, its equity, and its invested capital. The better and more consistent the performance of these indicators over time, the more likely this company has something durable going for it. Maybe a niche of some type, think like a small poisonous tree frog that specializes somehow to out compete others in the ecosystem. \n\nAnyways, I digress. I’m sorry I don’t have any real material to point to. I’d at least consider interpretation of financial statements by Ben Graham and some accounting for dummies books. Quite honestly I find dummies books so incredible to use. But I’d just look up accounting videos, and financial statement analysis.

The top reasons as to why the price are down is 1) concerns about cocoa prices and Hersheys pricing power to combat this. 2) some diet pills that aren’t even out yet, but are expected to suppress diet. Then you can throw in supplemental reasoning as the rate environment, or CPI if you wish. Also Morningstar reports some noise about one of the company’s NA Salty snacks brands from a recent acquisition.\n\nI’ve done a deep dive on the company. I don’t see the concerns. \n\nThe company has seen consistent growth YOY and in profit margin of all three segments. The salts snacks segment which is centered in pretzel brands and healthy snacks has really seen meaningful growth both through price increases and volume increases. \n\nIn fact the company has been able to consistently record favorable price increases across segments and has stayed well ahead of inflation. So I don’t see the 45-year high of cocoa being an issue. They dealt with this 45-years ago.\n\nAs far as the diet noise, this is candy not a food group. Their sales peak in Q3 and Q4 due to holiday volume. It does this for a reason, because unlike fast food people don’t eat candy all the time. But kind of like fast food, people have their favorite. It doesn’t matter if you diet, when you have that occasional candy bar you go to your favorite, the Reese’s, the Twix, the Kit Kat. The snicker, regardless if you diet or not. \n\nSo I think the company is being punished for reasons that won’t impact their long term potential.
