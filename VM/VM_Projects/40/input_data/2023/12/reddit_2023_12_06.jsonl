That said, they are not capturing market share as quickly as I expected and they don't seem to have enough volume to satisfy demand. There is also no straightforward path for them to increase production. Currently the rumor is that Apple and Intel both booked the bulk of TSMC's 3nm wafer capacity and there isn't much left for AMD. It's likely that at some point Intel will regain the node advantage, their next gen client lineup will mostly be fabricated by TSMC. \n\nOn the TSMC front it also looks like they focused on the 3nm node when they were having yield problems for Apple.

TSMC also doesn't seem to be investing as aggressively as Intel to get next gen lithography machines. \n\nIntel on the other hand is consistently falling behind schedule but they are getting slightly better.

In the 80s Japan looked like it was going to dominate the semiconductor space and then Uncle Sam placed his toe on the scales which pretty much resulted in US dominance of the sector. Now semiconductor are seen as a matter of national security and it's unlikely that Intel will need to continue to compete on an unleveled playing field. TSMC and Samsung have much lower costs because Taiwan and South Korea both provide massive subsidies for them. US will likely be doing the same with the bulk of the subsidies coming in the form of labor force training while some will be direct subsidies. This will help level the playing field between Intel fabs and their competitors over the next decade. Personally I doubt Taiwan and South Korea will try to outdo the US on the subsidy front, we just have way more money to throw at national security than they do.
