It can't be the **breakeven price at expiration for the buyer**, as that has nothing to do with the seller doing a BTC before expiration. And for sure, the breakeven price can only be about the size of the profit, not the probability of the profit. Probability of profit is all about moneyness at open, time to expiration and volatility.\n\n> Well it doesn't have to become otm since the premium paid for the intrinsic value of the option\n\nThat's what I meant by borrowing it from the buyer. Unless the put heads in the OTM direction, the intrinsic value will be retained, which means the buyer is going to want it back when you BTC. What good does a $6 credit do you if $5 is intrinsic value that you are going to have to pay back when you BTC, with interest? You would have been better off trading an OTM put for a $1 credit. \n\nJust to be clear, there is no \"the buyer.\" I'm just using that terminology for simplicity.\n\n> I was calculating for a cash (or margin) secured put so that would be the profit in relation to current stock price x 100.\n\nOkay, that's fine.

Which means the 660p is more leveraged.~~\n\nCORRECTION: Thanks to Arcite1, I'm less confused now. 660p is more ITM, so *higher* capital, but also higher premium, which is why the RoC is higher.\n\nYou might be interested to know that you can get more leverage without having to go so deep ~~OTM~~ ITM, by using leveraged short puts instead of CSPs. Leveraged short puts require a fraction of the assignment value as a buying power deduction, typically 20% to 40%, depending on the underlying. But trading leveraged (naked) short puts requires a higher level of options approval from your broker.\n\n> This exception tho only applies if the option is not exercise. \n\nAch so!

Setting the limit low kind of splits the difference between a market order and a limit order.

But I think there are two different points of confusion going on here.\n\nFirst, the reason your brokerage platform shows a cost basis of 9.57 is that that is how it is treated for tax purposes, because you spent a total of $957 in order to obtain the shares ($807 to buy the call, plus $150 to exercise.)  As far as the IRS is concerned, when you pay $807 for a call option at 1.5 strike, and exercise it, you bought shares at 9.57.  Meaning, there is no taxable event upon buying or exercising the option, but if you sell the shares at, say 10.57, you have a $100 capital gain.\n\nSecond, what wittgensteins-boat is trying to tell you is that, if you knew that you wanted to buy 100 shares of NIO all along, or even at any point before exercising your option, exercising a call option was not the best way to do it.  You spent a total of $957 to obtain the shares.  Well, when you first bought that call option, NIO must have been trading below 9.57.  Let's say it was trading at 9.25.  You could have just skipped buying the option, and bought the shares for $925, less than the $957 you wound up spending.\n\nOr, you don't say when you bought the call, nor what the expiration date was, but shortly before it was exercised, you probably could have sold it for more than the difference between its strike price and NIO's spot price.  Meaning, if NIO was trading at 8.30, you could have probably sold the option for, say, 7.00.  If you had done that, you would have received $700 for selling it, and could have bought the shares on the open market for $830.  So you would have spent a total of -807 + 700 - 830 = -$937 on the shares, less than the $957 you wound up spending.\n\nEdit: I see the removed post with screenshots containing some of this information, which you didn't repost here.  You bought the option at 10:45 AM yesterday, and chose to exercise.  During that 1 minute candle, NIO traded as low as 9.54.

A cash-secured put has synthetically the same P/L as a buy-write at the same strike.\n\nThe only reason your example appears to give the CC a higher premium is because you are borrowing the intrinsic value of the call from the buyer.

All that means is that you are taking out a larger loan against the intrinsic value of the contract. If they instantly exercise, you lose $100/share of value on your shares, because you'll be selling shares worth $200/sh for only $100/sh.

Say after eliminating all other strats, you are left with 6 that benefit from a rally in the underlying price. You can then narrow those 6 strats to 1 by considering:\n\n* Trade-offs in greeks. For example, you might want maximum delta and minimum vega, so you use the strat that has that greek profile.\n\n* Complexity. If two strats are otherwise equal, but one uses 2 legs and the other uses 4 legs, favor the the 2 legged strat for simplicity.\n\n* Cost. Some strats cost more than others, so use the one that is most cost-effective for the opportunity.\n\n* Approval level. You probably aren't approved by your broker to trade all possible strats, so eliminate the ones you can't use anyway.\n\n* Trade-offs in risk/reward.
