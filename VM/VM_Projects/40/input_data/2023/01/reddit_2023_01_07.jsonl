{"title": "The return of low rates/QE?", "selftext": "Virtually every financial publication has for some months now been declaring an end to the \"easy money\" era. Most of these articles seem to imply that the ongoing return to historically normal interest rates is something of a permeant, or at least, long term fixture. This sentiment is also very much echoed here on Reddit.  I am finding little counter to this across most financial opinion sites, so I'm asking, what are the cases for a return to low interest rates and possible QE?\n\nPerhaps the most obvious path would be that the hikes lead to a hard recession, forcing them to be almost entirely reversed (with possible QE in play also). Alternatively, if GDP is not growing at a satisfactory rate, could this also be a possible catalyst? What other scenarios could cause us to re-enter the era of low interest rates?", "id": "105dv64", "created_utc": 1673060221.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.48, "num_comments": 42, "comments": [{"body": "The debt.\n\nLow rates are a very high probablity.

Major economic events tend to have a tail on them of oscillation for years.  2) other parts of the equation oscillate or occur as a result of other factors so there is a cause and effect relationship that introduces lag.  \n\nWe can confirm however what we see in the consumption and savings functions by analyzing the velocity of money. \n\nV=PQ/M\n\nVelocity =GDP/M\n\nBased on the equation up above, and by holding the velocity of money constant, if Money supply (M) increases at a faster rate than the quantity of goods and services produced (Q), then prices (P) should rise. \n\nLikewise the opposite is true but V is never constant so \n\nThe problem is that velocity of money is never constant. (This essentially alone proves Milton Friedman was wrong and his whole schtick on money supply was wrong as indeed it was)\n\nSo it is a ratio. We know the money supply has increased, but we also know the velocity of money has collapsed and we know that the savings rate has fallen. The collapse of MV1 and MV2 portends demand falling. \n\nIncreasing money velocity rates imply a higher number of transactions and higher aggregate demand.
