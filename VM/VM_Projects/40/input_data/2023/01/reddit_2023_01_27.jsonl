Boeing employs about 136,000 workers in the United States.\n\nBoeing acknowledged it will “lower staffing within some support functions” - a move meant to enable it to better align resources to support current products and technology development. It declined to comment on how many jobs it will cut in 2023.\n\nMost of the growth will occur in Boeing’s business units, as well as engineering and manufacturing, to meet airlines’ growing demand.\n\nThe company plans to increase deliveries of the 737 MAX from 374 aircraft in 2022 to between 400 to 450 planes this year, with deliveries of the 787 expected to hit between 70 and 80 aircraft.\n\nEuropean rival Airbus said this week it plans to add 13,000 employees this year. About 7,000 of those jobs are set to be newly created positions, with about 9,000 of the new hires based in Europe.\n\nBoeing did not comment on how many net new jobs would created in the United States in 2023.\n\nThe U.S. planemaker is nearing pre-pandemic workforce levels, which stood at 161,000 people at the end of 2019. During 2020, the workforce fell to about 141,000 employees after Boeing announced job reductions.\n\n“Hiring is not a constraint anymore,” Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told analysts Wednesday. “People are able to hire the people they need.

The M777 is a highly accurate, towed gun that fires 155-millimeter artillery shells, which are also in diminishing supply.\n\n-\n> Congress this year has moved to allow the Defense Department to more broadly make multiyear spending commitments for certain weapons systems and shipbuilding operations. [...] That move alone suggests **$73 billion in additional munitions orders could be on the way in the next three years**, contracts that will largely benefit the big players like Lockheed and Raytheon\n\n-\n> Military contractors have nearly **stopped manufacturing Stingers** — Raytheon’s last contract from the U.S. government was in 2002, Mr. Haynes said.

[...] Traditionally, Lockheed has been able to build **60 of these trucks per year**, but it is now shifting production to 24 hours a day and seven days a week in an effort to bring that **annual total to 96 units.** It also now has a new $430 million contract to deliver more HIMARS, along with a new $521 million contract to build more of the rockets, called GMLRS, that these vehicles can fire.\n\n-\n> Total arms sales in fiscal year 2022, about $52 billion worth, **exceeded FY21's** $34.81 billion in sales by **nearly 50%**.\n\n-\n> Mark Cancian, a senior adviser also with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, earlier this month also identified **155 mm artillery rounds** as part of **six categories** of weapons and ammunition that **won’t be restocked for at least three years**, forecasting that some **might not be rebuilt for up to 18 years**.\n\n-\n> A recent report for the Center for Strategic and International Studies estimated that if the **U.S. sent Ukraine about a third of its supply** of these [GLMRS for HIMARS] rockets, that would amount to some **8,000 to 10,000** rockets.

Two, to guarantee such a plan works, you need to release the virus as well, thats an act of terrorism and yeah if Pfizer is planning a dumbass idea like that, they should get in deep shit.\n\nHonestly just sounds like bs to further put down mRNA technology. mRNA tech for vaccines is better than the traditional inactivated virus because you are dealing with less proteins, so less off-target effects from your immune system. So that's why we use it now. mRNA is also very transient, being cleared by the liver of itself and the lipid nanoparticles that encapsulates it. However, the dude is probably referring to using machine learning yo predict mutations are make libraries ahead of time, no mutations need to be injected into Covid.\n\nI worked with mRNA for 3 years, so I know my shit, more or less.\n\nTLDR: Sounds like misconstrued science, likely referencing machine learning predictions of and not real mutations. mRNA good, typical conspiracy, see yall Monday.", "score": 0, "replies": []}, {"body": "NVAX.

We think that stabilizes this year,\" Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told investors on a conference call. He said Intel has been losing market share in the data center market, a nod at the strength of rival Advanced Micro Devices.\n\nTwo of Intel's most important markets are showing weakness after two years of strong growth as remote work boomed during the pandemic. Now, the PC industry is struggling with a glut of chips after demand for consumer electronics fell off a cliff and business customers wary of a recession are slowing spending on data centers.\n\nGelsinger told Reuters that customers also were emptying inventory.\n\n\"We expect some of the largest inventory corrections literally that we've ever seen in the industry taking place that's affecting the Q1 guide in a meaningful way,\" he said.\n\n\"Everything hinges on the PC market recovery. AMD isn’t immune to this either,\" said Wayne Lam, an analyst at CCS Insight. \"Don’t think we’ve seen the bottom for INTC...They are not running a sustainable business model.\"\n\nIntel expects profit margins to fall further after dropping from 58.4% in the fourth quarter of 2020 to 43.8% in the fourth quarter of 2022. \"Its safe to say that ambitions to return to a 60% margin in the future is light years away,\" said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.\n\nIntel reiterated its medium-term goal of 51-53% gross margin, and 54-58% longer term.\n\nShares of other microchip companies fell as well, with AMD down 2.6% and Nvidia Corp down 2%.\n\nPC shipments fell 16.5% to 292.3 million units in 2022, per data from research firm IDC, forcing chipmakers to cut back production and slash revenue forecasts.\n\nShrinking PC demand also **pressured** Microsoft Corp's More Personal Computing segment, which includes Windows, devices and search revenue, leading to a 19% drop in the segment in its second quarter.\n\nMeanwhile, the data center market has also slowed from double-digit growth as businesses cut costs to ride out an economic slowdown.\n\nAfter Gelsinger returned to the company nearly two years ago, Intel has focused on regaining the lead in chipmaking technology. Outsourcing the chipmaking process has helped rivals like AMD make much smaller and faster chips and outpace Intel's technology.\n\nThe company forecast first-quarter revenue in the range of about $10.5 billion to $11.5 billion. Analysts on average were expecting total revenue of $13.93 billion, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nThe company expects an adjusted loss of 15 cents per share versus expectations of a 24 cents per share profit.\n\nRevenue in the fourth quarter fell 32% to $14 billion. Analysts on average expected revenue of $14.46 billion.\n\nSource: [https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-forecasts-first-quarter-revenue-below-expectations-2023-01-26/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-forecasts-first-quarter-revenue-below-expectations-2023-01-26/)\n\nIntel, Corp (INTC) is currently down 10% in the premarket trading after reporting its 4th quarter earnings that showed significant declines in the company’s sales, profit, gross margin, and outlook, both for the quarter and the full year.
