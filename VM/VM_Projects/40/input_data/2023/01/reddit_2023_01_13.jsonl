You can quibble over plenty of details, but a huge drop in inflation like this will show in any of them. \n\nAs for money, well most measures of broad money aggregates show that they have either declined, or increased by well under 1%, over the past year as well. That includes official measures like [M2](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Ysq6), as well as unofficial measures such as [Divisia M3 and M4](https://centerforfinancialstability.org/amfm_data.php#thumb).

If the government weren't so inclined to fuck it up more by further belated interventions in response to what was happening more than 6 months ago. The initial shock here, the Covid recession, wasn't really *that* big of a deal. Yes, a number of workers, especially in places where you had a lot of people indoors, had to stay home for a couple of months. At least until we had good testing. \n\nWhich as an aside, would have been sooner if it weren't for another government fuck up. The CDC first insisted on a government monopoly on developing the COVID test, then botched the job, delaying the development by over a month (they finally let private labs begin developing tests on 2/29/20). \n\nBut after that, most people got back to work pretty quickly. Unemployment, which had spiked to 14.7% by April 2020, had already fallen back to 6.9% by October 2020. The economy was already well on it's way to a steady recovery. Then we got two more stimulus packages. \n\nAltogether, in 2020-2021, we got $4.8T in stimulus (> 22% of annual GDP), in response to a recession which NBER measured as lasting 2 months. Compare that to 2008-2009, when Presidents Bush and Obama combined to sign under $1T in stimulus (~ 6.4% of annual GDP), in response to a recession which NBER measured as lasting 18 months. \n\nIt seemed to me that this was not only too much, and was not only not needed, but likely doing actual harm, by September of 2021. Unemployment was down to 4.8%, inflation was surging, home prices surging. And yet the Fed did nothing to counteract it, while the problem was actually occurring. By Q4 2021, nominal GDP was growing at 14.3% seasonally adjusted annual rate, with the economy already near to full employment. \n\nBut the fiscal excess was over then too. The Federal Fiscal deficit was:\n\n    $1.0T in 2019\n    $3.1T in 2020\n    $2.8T in 2021\n    $1.4T in 2022\n\nThat's still higher than ideal, but getting similar as a %of gdp to 2019 (5.4% vs. 4.6%). I mean, prices won't go *down* again after that, but they'll stabilize at the current level if they just let policy stabilize here. \n\nToo many people are expecting a repeat of the 1970s, but inflation expectations are much more anchored than the 1970s.
