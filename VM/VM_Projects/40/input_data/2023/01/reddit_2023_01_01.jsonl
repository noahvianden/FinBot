It will ultimately have to be a car company, in the car market, and I suspect car company valuations. Using current forward earnings estimates $70 would give it a forward P/E of around 12.59. This is still on the higher side for autos, but it may a demand higher multiple, that’s for an investor to figure out.\n\nI have no idea if it’s a good idea for you, and you can’t just take people’s advise online since they don’t know either, but, being that as the risk… how does that sound to you?
