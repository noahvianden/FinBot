{"title": "9-13 Jan. Detailed Economic for the Coming Week", "selftext": "Hey guys  ready for fun next week?\n\nWe've got important data from the United States, China, and Europe, including CPI and trade figures, GDP figures, and unemployment and industrial production figures coming this week.\n\nThe market is kind of in limbo right now, trying to figure out whether to worry about more Fed rate hikes or hope for an economic boost from China's reopening. The latest Fed minutes made it clear that the central bank is still committed to targeting inflation, but they also warned that market rallies could get in the way.\n\nWe'll see if the upcoming CPI release is lower than expected,. It's not clear how the market will react to softer inflation numbers, especially with the Fed being cautious about market rallies.\n\nAlthough the official data hasn't shown much of an impact from recent Fed rate hikes yet, GDP probably grew at an annualized rate above 2% in Q4. But survey data is starting to show the negative effects of tighter monetary policy, especially in financial services. S&P Global's PMI survey data showed business activity falling sharply in December, with financial services seeing the steepest contraction. Consumer-facing sectors and manufacturing also struggled due to rising costs of living and slowing global trade. On the bright side, tech and healthcare remained in expansion territory, but it looks like GDP growth might disappoint in the New Year.\n\nLet’s get to the calendar.\n\n# MONDAY, JAN. 9\n\n**12:30 pm: Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speaks**\n\nBostic's speech might give us some clues about what's going on with the economy and where the Fed is headed in terms of its policies. Sounds interesting, huh?\n\n**3:00 pm: Consumer Credit Change (NOV) Forecast: $24B Previous: $27.08B**\n\nThis data release from the Federal Reserve just shows how much credit people have taken out in the past month. It's just a measure of how much people are borrowing, and it might give us some clues about consumer spending and borrowing habits.\n\n# TUESDAY, JAN. 10\n\nJerome Powell is giving a speech on 10th? It's like, who cares, right? I mean, Powell's speeches are always such a wild card. It's like the weather - you never know what you're going to get. One minute the markets are soaring, and the next minute, BOOM, everything crashes. But hey, at least it's always entertaining.\n\n**9:00 a.m. Fed Chair Powell Speaks (medium-high )**\n\n**17:00 Wholesale Inventories MoM (NOV) Forecast:** 1% Previous: 0.5% (medium )\n\nThis shows us how much stuff wholesalers have in stock, and it can tell us about supply and demand in the wholesale sector. They're expecting the number to go up by 1% from last month, which was when it went up by 0.5%.\n\n**EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook**\n\nThis report tells us what to expect in the energy market over the next few months. I know it doesn't sound very exciting, but it can give us an idea of what energy prices might do, which can affect how much we pay for things like gas and home heating. It's not the most thrilling topic, but it's worth paying attention.\n\n# WEDNESDAY, JAN. 11\n\nIt's going to be a busy day for oil and bond traders, with a couple of key data releases on the calendar.\n\n**17:30 Crude Oil Inventories**\n\nThis report shows the change in the number of barrels of crude oil held in storage in the U.S., and it can give us an idea of the supply and demand dynamics in the oil market.\n\n17:30 Cushing Crude Oil Inventories\n\nMore crude oil inventory data? You bet! As I said, busy day for oil traders.\n\n**20:00 10-Year Note Auction**\n\nTime for a little bond action!\n\n# THURSDAY, JAN. 12\n\nThe busiest day of the week!\n\n**7:00 AM - ECB Economic Bulletin: The European Central Bank** will be dropping some serious knowledge on the state of the economy. Hopefully, they won't bore us to death.\n\n3:30 PM - Core CPI (YoY) (Dec): This release measures the change in the price of a basket of goods and services over the past year. In other words, it tells us whether stuff is getting more or less expensive. **Forecast** **5.7% Previous 6.0%**\n\n3:30 PM - Core CPI (MoM) (Dec): This one is similar to the YoY release, but it only looks at the change in prices over the past month. **Forecast** **0.3% Previous** **0.2%**\n\n3:30 PM - Core CPI Index (Dec): The Core CPI Index measures the average price of the basket of goods and services included in the Core CPI. It's kind of like the \"average temperature\" of inflation if you will.\n\n3:30 PM - CPI (MoM) (Dec): The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change in prices over time for a basket of goods and services. This particular release looks at the change in prices over the past month. **Forecast** **0.1% Previous 0.1%**\n\n3:30 PM - CPI (YoY) (Dec): This release is the same as the MoM version, but it looks at the change in prices over the past year. **Forecast** 6.5% **Previous** 7.1%\n\n3:30 PM - Initial Jobless Claims: A measure of how many people applied for unemployment benefits in the past week.\n\n**Forecast** 220K **Previous** 204K\n\n8:00 PM - 30-Year Bond Auction: The government will be selling some long-term debt today. Let's hope they can find some takers, or else they might have to default on their loans.\n\n9:00 PM - Federal Budget Balance (Dec): The government's financial report card for the month.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 13\n\n**14:30 Fed Harker Speech**\n\n**17:00 Michigan Consumer Sentiment Prel (JAN) Forecast: 60 Previous: 59.7%**\n\n[Original article includes charts information](https://open.substack.com/pub/vallo/p/9-13-jan-detailed-economic-and-crypto?r=1vplml&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)", "id": "106qgtm", "created_utc": 1673202866.0, "score": 89, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 43, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 week ago\n**Total Comments**|43|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|2 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: - There's a lot of data coming out this week from the US, China, and Europe, including inflation figures, GDP figures, and unemployment and industrial production figures.", "score": 1, "replies": []}, {"body": "And they say you don't learn anything from this sub.
