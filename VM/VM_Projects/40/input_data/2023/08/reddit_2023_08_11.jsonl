However I'm a single dude, so I don't really have another person's happiness to consider. The way I think of it, is I try to cook on days I will eat alone, and go out for meals with friends or dates. If I used UberEats or Postmates every other day, I could easily rack up $400-$600 a month. It's all a balance which is what I was trying to describe in my previous post. Don't short yourself all of the short term happiness from eating tasty food or whatever you want to spend your money on, but not thinking about your future and retirement is going to hurt a helluva lot more than skipping Chick-fil-A a couple times a month. Balance/moderation is the game.\n\nAs far as losing all the money you save, that all depends on your investment choices. I'd be willing to wager a pretty penny that if you just DCAed into the S&P 500 and held onto it for 5-10 years, you would make a decent return, or at least beat out inflation by a couple percent. \n\nFor your example, $600/mo is $7200 a year. Let's say the $SPY (S&P ETF) average annualized return is 6% after accounting for inflation, you're looking at $7632 for the first year, which becomes $50222.29 at the 5 year mark, given that you completely stop eating out and continue to invest the $600/mo. Just for fun, at 10 years, you would have $107,795.83, after only contributing $79,200.00. That's pretty fantastic if you ask me.\n\nAnd if anyone claims that it's not safe because of the stock market, I have several questions for you:\n1) What do you think 401(k)s or other retirements are based off of?\n2) If the S&P 500 collapses, we have bigger problems than pinching pennies and eating out. It is essentially an ETF based on the almost every sector of the stock market, the world economy would have to collapse.\n\nIf you are still worried about it, get a HYSA, which is about a 4% return. \n\nI guess all I am trying to say is: 1)  that everything is fine in moderation, and 2) the power of compounding interest.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "The first year would be \\~$1305.
