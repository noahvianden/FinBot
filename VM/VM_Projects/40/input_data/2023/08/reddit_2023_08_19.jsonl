{"title": "Early assignment of the short leg of my Bull Put Credit Spread. Looking for advice.", "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI've just got an assignment notification from my brokerage that the short leg of my Bull Put Credit Spread (**AAPL Sep01'23 185 Put)** has been assigned. It is a long position with a quantity of 300 AAPL shares at an average price of $185. \n\nI currently am unable to hold the shares as my account isn't big enough to do so.\n\nWhat should I do? I read that I should create a Covered Stock Option and sell my 300 shares and close my long leg (**AAPL Sep01'23 180 Put)** and get back some extrinsic value.\n\nOn the other hand, as AAPL's last traded price is at $174.70, should I just exercise my long leg (AAPL Sep01'23 180 Put) and cancel out my long position of 300 shares? What is the benefit of doing so and is it worth considering?\n\nI am new to options trading and I'm surprised that early assignment has happened so quickly to me.\n\nThanks for your input, it's greatly appreciated.", "id": "15v8mzn", "created_utc": 1692427495.0, "score": 14, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 48, "comments": [{"body": "Don't panic when your cash balance goes negative - that's normal.  Normal for brokers and people who have used margin before - it might not look normal for you.  The negative cash is a loan, and your account will have enough assets to back it up.\n\nSay you have $20,000 in cash and 3 put contracts.  IBKR will subtract $55,500 ($185 strike x 100 sh x 3 contracts) from that, and your cash balance will show up as -35,500.  You are taking out a loan for $35k.\n\nIBKR isn't worried, because you will also get 100 shares of AAPL per contract.  With 3 contracts, that means 300 shares of AAPL.  At current prices, $174.70 x 300 = $52,410  That's why IBKR isn't worried... you borrowed $35k but you have $52k in new assets.\n\nWhen you sell 300 shares of AAPL, you'll replace those 300 shares with $52,410 of cash (assuming no changes between now and when you sell - unlikely, just using an example).  Your margin loan will get automatically paid off, and you'll have $16,910 in cash (actually slightly less after $1 in commissions and some amount of SEC fees).\n\nYou should lose less than expected in this scenario.  Your short leg was exercised, meaning you lose intrinsic value.  But you get to sell the long leg, and gain intrinsic and extrinsic (time) value.  So your losses will probably be less than $500/contract.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Hi, wow, you truly explained this well and made it so beginner friendly, I appreciate it so much. So to summarise what I should do (please correct me if I'm wrong):\n\nIf it hasn't been automatically liquidated by my brokerage (IBKR), I should sell my 300 shares at the prevailing market rate, and at the same time sell the long leg of my credit spread in one single combination order.\n\nBut if my shares were already liquidated by my brokerage, I should just put in a limit order for my long leg and sell it to get extrinsic value.\n\nOne more question, do I need to do this immediately when the market opens?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Because this is new to you, I'd suggest doing one step at a time.\n\nThe put option you hold has about 28x leverage, so you can gain or lose money quickly.  I'd sell that first.  (Each put receives the inverse of the gain/loss on 100 shares of AAPL stock.  Your $630 put contract receives gain/loss from $17,449 worth of AAPL stock, which is where I estimated 28x leverage.  Others may view it differently)\n\nSecond, congratulate yourself for picking the broker with the lowest margin rates (Interactive Brokers).  Your margin loan will be about half that of other brokers, where you'll pay 7% (IBKR Pro) to 8% (IBKR Lite) per year.  IBKR makes money off the interest you pay - they actually just push your loan more negative.  So a margin loan for $10k might look like (10,000) in red on the first day, and maybe (10,002) the next day.  Actual rates and numbers will vary, but I thought an example helps.\n\nI'd sell the AAPL stock next.  You've probably sold stock before, so this step will feel more familiar.  In a weird situation with assignment and negative cash, you'd be surprised how reassuring it is to see something familiar.  When you sell the AAPL stock, the proceeds will go towards paying off your margin loan.\n\nTLDR: As a beginner, sell the put option (high leverage) first, then sell AAPL shares.", "score": 3, "replies": []}]}]}, {"body": "Sell the shares at whatever the market value is on Monday, which may be around $175 per share when the market opens.  Based on your account size the broker may liquidate the shares for you before you get the chance to close them if you are underwater by a significant amount.  \n\nSell the 180 long put for the current value using a limit order which will collect that value.  Once all is netted out the max loss should be close to the amount when the spread was opened give or take.

I currently have a $420 covered call on COST that I have been rolling up for the last couple of years.  I was selling a put on COST when it was around $300 and collecting a nice premium.  And the day came when COST dipped below the strike price at the very end of the day and I got assigned.  Come Monday I owned a hundred shares of COST.  So I sold a call at $310 something like that and COST took off.  I have been chasing it ever since.  I roll up about 10 or 20 bucks depending, about every five or six months, almost always a small credit, but I have never been called away.   Right now the call sp is $420 and COST is $540.
