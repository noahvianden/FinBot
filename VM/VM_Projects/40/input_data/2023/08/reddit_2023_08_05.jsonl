If you bet on the under you are betting on nothing that happens. As the game progresses and nothing happens your bet will slowly gain in value (theta). Yet if there is a goal that is gamma and it will cause big losses at once. As the game nears an end if the line is close to your bet your theta will increase, but your gamma will also increase. At the end of the day you are betting on the line. Selling a 1 day call is like buying the under for 1 quarter of the match and selling a 5 day call is buying the under for the game. Neither should inherently have higher or lower returns. \n\nHigher theta does not equal higher alpha (or excess returns).\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------  \n\n\nIn terms of bonds I would buy shorter-dated government bonds.
