The skills you‚Äôre learing now will serve you for the rest of your life.\n\nI trade the wheel ‚Äúfull time‚Äù and have done so for years.  What you post is a good plan, but you can see mine below that I posted some years ago and many have used to learn from.\n\nNot knowing more details, a comment would be to diversify the stocks more as you are very focused in tech.  Look for some stocks from the 11 sectors to have diversification across the broader market.  If tech tanks you could have some risk.\n\nOptimizng returns is part a function of the market as sometimes the market gives great returns but other times not as much, so IMO take what the market is giving and work to avoid taking more risks chasing higher returns as it can end badly.\n\nSee the link for my trading plan, hopefully it helps as you develop your own - [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the\\_wheel\\_aka\\_triple\\_income\\_strategy\\_explained/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/a36k4j/the_wheel_aka_triple_income_strategy_explained/)", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you so much!!", "score": 5, "replies": []}, {"body": "The man, the legend!!!

The wheel has been around for many years before me . . .\n\nI traded and invested in stocks for many year, but as I started trading with CCs but explored almost all of the strategies, including many that were advanced and complex, but also simple spreads as well.  What I found was these had losses that were at times unavoidable.  As most newer traders do I started looking for ways to reduce the number of losses and \"discovered\" selling puts until assigned and then selling CCs on stocks I was already holding because I thought they were good investments.  It seemed a win-win as I could make some options profits and the worse case is buying shares on stocks I either already owned or was happy to own.  \n\nI was calling it the Triple Income Strategy as I could profit in 3 ways, from selling the puts, stock increases if assigned, and from selling CCs.  It could even be a quad income when including dividends most of the blue chips I trade offer.\n\nAs I was exploring this strategy I found the term wheel which others had named it.  If I brought anything it was to document how I traded which is what I thought was the optimal way for me.  As we see, there are dozens of ways to trade the 'wheel' with many variations, so how I trade it may not be best for anyone but me.  Even though there are so many who trade it (tens or hundreds of thousands?  millions?) there are still those who say it can't make money or work.
