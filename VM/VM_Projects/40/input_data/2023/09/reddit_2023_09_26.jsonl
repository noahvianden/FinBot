Letâ€™s assume your options book only has two positions which is -100 contracts at the money and +100 contracts 1 point above the underlyingâ€™s price. Letâ€™s say all these contracts expire in 1 week. Your net position will be short gamma, so if price begins to rally away from your short strikes your position will start to get shorter delta as price rises up to some point where gamma begins to flip positive as you get closer to the out of the money strikes. If price rallies away from your short strikes and stops on top of your long strikes then your net position will now be long gamma (youâ€™ll be paying theta as opposed to being paid theta). Since youâ€™re delta hedging you donâ€™t care if itâ€™s in the money since options that are above spot are calls and options below are puts. \n\n\nAgain, what matters for dealers is where price is relative to their inventory. Right now the majority of flow dominating gamma space in equities is in short dated maturities which have a lot of gamma on them, and the majority of the flow is also long gamma so dealers are short strikes all up and down the options chain. So imagine instead of your position being -100 at the money and +100 above price you have -100 ATM and -100 at every strike +/- 5 points either direction. Now youâ€™re short no matter where price goes!
