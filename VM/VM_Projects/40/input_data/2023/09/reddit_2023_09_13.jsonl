Not the same thing exactly, but GILD was the hottest stock in biotech for a few years with the HEP-C drugs. They weren't able to build on that and the stock is still under 2015 highs 8 years later. PFE had a huge windfall with covid - it's certainly possible they don't build on it as well as they could/should have either. I mean, already brought up in this thread but not really addressed: Pfizer had a big windfall with covid and what has the stock done in the last 5 years? -16%.\n\nIf people aren't interested in PFE it's more likely because they looked at what the stock has done for the last 20-25 years (share price is still below where it was in 1999.) It's become a dinosaur and capital allocation a little questionable (almost bought Allergan for $363 in 2016 only to be blocked by regulators; Abbvie bought it for about half that four years later after the stock had cratered.) PFE's announcement of the SGEN purchase in March has done nothing to stop the share price's gradual erosion this year.\n\n\"Pfizer is a play on covid continuing to be a pain in the ass for years to come\"\n\nPeople don't want to take the boosters and they definitely don't want to pay to. This was clear a while ago when CVS/Walgreens were reporting numbers and as time went on those numbers started to erode quicker than people thought they would. Investing in this because covid imo is not a good idea. \n\n\"Finally, Pfizer is an anti-bubble stock that will go back to normality.\"\n\nThis sub really seems to have this focus this year of trying to be \"contrarian\" and going to the other extreme away from anything hot to anything \"mediocre but well known\" (nice to see somewhat fewer T/VZ posts lately) or \"problematic\" (DIS) then there's a disappointment when the market doesn't instantly join them.  If you don't want a portfolio of hot stocks, totally fine, but there's a lot of good, well-run companies in the middle. And sometimes the hot company can stay hot - how many people ignored LLY because it was \" too hot\" at $400 and bought something like PFE because they also had an obesity drug, only to see LLY ramp another $200? The well-run hot company can stay hot longer or much longer than you expect and buying the \"also ran\" sometimes just doesn't work at all. \n\n Is PFE  a terrible company? No and it probably does get a bounce at some point. Are there tons of better managed companies out there, many of which are benefitting from themes more compelling then continued covid? Yes, imo.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "1) It's one thing to say they'd never invest at this point but if this was the middle of covid and it was going up (although BNTX/MRNA vastly superior plays) that's something else. Additionally, a bunch of these sort of responses on a message board is not something I'd take as useful or broadly representative of investors as a whole. This feels like meme stock investors blaming hedge funds rather than the companies failures. There's always \"haters\" of some sort (never the company's fault) and people who won't buy because they don't like Pfizer (and no way to quantify that or know that people wouldn't chase if it actually did well for once) aren't what's holding the stock back.\n\n2) Look at Pfizer over the last 5 years, or 20: what has anyone who hasn't invested in it for whatever reason really missed?
