{"title": "Who Will be the First OEM Auto Company to License FSD", "selftext": "Last earnings call Elon mentioned that Tesla was in talks with a major OEM to potentially license FSD. Based on the adoption of Tesla technology and articles I have read, I think it will be Ford. I saw a video of Jim  Farley complaining about the software they use. He talked about how hard it was to do any updates to the software that runs the car. You have to move heaven and earth to make any changes because how the software they use was an amalgamation from different companies, whereas Tesla was developed inhouse. Additionally, Ford was the first to announce their adoption of Tesla's NACS and Elon has given props to Ford saying the only two American OEMs that haven't gone bankrupt were Ford and Tesla.\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/23800972/tesla-fsd-license-car-company-driver-assist", "id": "16nl7l8", "created_utc": 1695216163.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.53, "num_comments": 59, "comments": [{"body": "You mean, a feature that doesn’t work and bound for lawsuits?", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Been driving with mine for months now.

You're just making b/s up using 1,000 miles of data (FSD generates millions of miles of data every week). You're adding disengagements, e.g., switching destinations (according to the chart you provided, navigation/map disengagements were the most common) as a fault of FSD when it could be someone wanting coordinates to Popeyes but then chose a different location.\n\nObviously FSD can't do 1,000 miles uninterrupted... the vehicles can't even go 1,000 miles uninterrupted without charging, lmao... what are you even saying? It also depends where. Driving 50 miles on a highway is a lot different than driving 50 city miles.

Add software on top of that and you’re looking at $50-100k for autonomous driving. That’s just not a feasible solution for consumer vehicles. The legacy OEMs know this. And tesla knows this.
