(All ballpark figures, of course.)\n\nFor them to 'up' production is absolutely nothing for a multibillion dollar program with a ten year horizon, assuming they share cells with the TMY. \n\nI actually don't personally believe cells are shared with the TMY and it's more likely they have a trickle of separate-supply high-nickel cells made on a pilot line — but if you assume the cells are shared, it's absolutely not reasonable that they somehow need to 'reserve' cells for the TMY.\n\nA few hundred semis' worth of batteries is an absolute rounding error for Tesla.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "I don’t see your point. 6000 units is hardly high volume.
