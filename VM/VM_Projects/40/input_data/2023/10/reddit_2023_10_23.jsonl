Higher gamma is typically *bad* for neutral credit plays, like Iron Condors. Credit plays typically count on selling *higher IV* in the hope it falls lower within a few days after the event.\n\nThe expiration decision is a trade-off. The closer the expiration is to the event, the higher theta has to be to drive extrinsic value to zero by expiration, and the more impact a constant decline in IV will have, since there is less extrinsic value to start with. The further you go out, the less impact theta and vega have in your favor, but the higher the initial credit (extrinsic value) will be.

In terms of cumulative theta decay, yes, that is true. But that is countered by more time for the underlying price to hit and exceed a profit target. And buyers generally believe that the benefit of more time outweighs the negatives of more time. After all, you can't lose more than the initial extrinsic value to theta decay, while the upside gain is unlimited (for a call).\n\n> I think maybe you mean it in reference to my specific question on this specific earnings strategy. If I'm playing primarily IV crush, I should want to play that game quickly, right?\n\nI wouldn't necessarily say that, no. Ideally, you maximize the favorable change in IV, like sell at the peak and buy back at the trough. Where those points fall in time will vary from situation to situation.\n\nFor example, there is nothing preventing IV from increasing AFTER an earnings report.

Scaling up is sometimes necessary in order to make the reward worth the risk. For example, consider a very low-risk option trade that pays $.69/share. So the max profit quantity 1 can pay is $69, which is not a lot of money to get excited about, right? Even if it is an 85% win rate trade, who cares? A win buys me one B-tier video game.\n\nLeverage is the other reason to scale up. It's a similar reason, but leverage is more about dollars than win-rate. If I have a trade where I can risk $100 to win $6900, that's exciting. Why not do quantity 420 of those and make more money? Nevermind that the win rate is 3% ...\n\n> How do those guys with lots of capital know that it's safe to buy like 10 or 20 plus contracts at a time?\n\nThose guys aren't interested in \"safe\".

It depends on the dollar volume of the contract. If it's ATM SPY monthlies, a 10 contract trade is not going to move the needle on the market and you can see trades of that size and bigger cross the tape on a daily basis. But for odd-ball POG LEAPS calls that have 0 volume for most of the year, a 10 contract trade could very well move the market. A little.\n\nKeep in mind that for most contracts, the nominal share volume in contracts is a fraction of the daily share volume of trading on the stock market. I did a calculation for AAPL calls once, and the nominal total single day share volume represented by **all** calls traded on AAPL, not just one expiration or strike but all of them, was about 1/10th the AAPL shares traded on the stock exchange the same day. And that was *not* adjusted for delta, that was just assuming 1 call represented 100 shares of volume, so 1/10th is the *upper limit* of the fraction of share volume. So a guy filling a 69 quantity order on just one strike/expiration of AAPL calls isn't going to be more than a drop in the bucket vs. what's changing hands in the stock market.\n\nI used to routinely trade quantity 20 Iron Condors, so that's 80 contracts total, since an IC has 4 contracts per spread.

Or from the pov of the seller, the premium the seller demands to compensate them for the risk of covering the expected move, should the contract be exercised. In fact, you can estimate the 1 day expected move of an underlying by dividing the IV of an ATM call by 16, using the so-called [Rule of 16](https://www.optionmatters.ca/understand-the-rule-of-16/). Understanding the Rule of 16 will help you understand IV in general.\n\n> Shouldn´t IV rise when underlying is falling AND rising, and fall when the underlying doesn´t move?\n\nIf rising and falling were symmetric in stock prices, you would be right. But they aren't. There's an age-old saying about stock prices: You take the stairs up and the elevator down. Which means rising trends tend to be spread out over time and in small increments per unit time, while declines tend to be sharply compressed in time, with large moves per unit time. \n\nThere's also the element of uncertainty. Increases in stock price tend to have less uncertainty, because they are usually based on some catalyst or material change in facts, like actual top line revenue exceeding old forecasts by 10%. That's a realized fact, so there's no uncertainty about it happening, it already has. Whereas decreases, even when concrete and realized, like company XYZ took a $300 million write-down due to an unfavorable litigation outcome, the psychology of the market fears that if one item of bad news has happened, what other bad news might happen that we don't know about yet? The market tends to be more anxious about surprises to the downside than to the upside. However, market euphoria and hype can pump up stock price beyond all rational reason as well, as what arguably happened with TSLA in 2020 when it's P/E almost hit 1000, which is absurd. It just happens less often than for the downside fear.", "score": 1, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "Hi,\n\nI am a newbie to options and have started with Vertical Credit spreads.
