At the time, Brent was trading at $96. The Reuters September Oil Poll showed on Friday that 42 economists and analysts now see Brent Crude prices averaging $84.09 per barrel in 2023, up from the $82.45 consensus projection in August.", "id": "17dwuys", "created_utc": 1697991264.0, "score": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 52, "comments": [{"body": "I remember experts warned of $200 a barrel, when Ukraine was invaded.", "score": 116, "replies": [{"body": "I remember when Oil prices went negative", "score": 73, "replies": [{"body": "Pandemic anomaly where domestic storage was 100.00% brimmed and the negative price was essentially a mechanism to pay someone to take it off your hands on the day you were legally required to take physical possession of the barrels.", "score": 29, "replies": []}, {"body": "Considering how cash strapped Americans are, $140 wouldn’t bode well.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "There‘s a proven strategy to deal with high oil prices … it‘s using less oil", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "The proven strategy is engaging in a war in the middle east*", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Honestly maybe I’m cynical but I thought that what he or she was going to say", "score": 2, "replies": []}, {"body": "It was so far, but if demand drops that would be cost prohibitive", "score": 0, "replies": []}]}, {"body": "shocking yoke steer far-flung plant possessive offend like cows squalid\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "That is a very outdated and simplistic view.

Yes absolutely. Will they? Almost definitely not.

Financial institutions say all the time that whatever stock or commodity could reach some outlandish price target and when it nearly never does they always fall back on the fact they only said \"could\" and that they never said they even necessarily believed it would.\nThat being said this is of course not financial advice as I'm not a financial advisor, just my opinion.", "score": 25, "replies": [{"body": "Doomsday?
