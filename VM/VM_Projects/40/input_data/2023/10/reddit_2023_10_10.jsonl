{"title": "Study found a strong positive relationship between employee wellbeing, firm performance, and stock performance", "selftext": "A [study](https://wellbeing.hmc.ox.ac.uk/papers/wp-2304-workplace-wellbeing-and-firm-performance/) analysed data on firm performance (return on assets, gross profit, and company valuation) and data from Indeed on work/employee wellbeing, which was a survey about stress, satisfication, happinness, and purpose at work. The study found a strong positive relationship was found between employee wellbeing, return on assets, gross profit, company valuation, and stock performance. Relevant graphs: [https://imgur.com/a/k4YiCPG](https://imgur.com/a/k4YiCPG).\n\nThe study also used employee happiness data from Indeed between October 2019 and February 2020 (pre-COVID) to predict firm performance during 2020 and 2021 and found that employee happiness predicted future firm performance.\n\nThe study analysed the impact of employee wellbeing on firm performance for 5 industries:\n\n* services\n* finance, insurance, and real estate\n* wholesale and trade\n* transportation and public utilties\n* manufacturing\n\nAgriculture, mining, and construction were not analysed due to an insufficient sample size. Employee wellbeing had a positive effect for the services, finance, insurance, real estate, and manufacturing industries, with the largest positive effect occurring for the services industry. For wholesale, trade, transportation, and public utilties, the effects were mostly insignificant. Though, due to the smaller sample size when broken down by industry, the study mentioned that the industry-specific results were less precise than the other results and should be treated as an exploratory initial analysis.\n\nThe study also found that the top 50 and top 100 highest wellbeing companies outperformed the S&P500, Nasdaq 100, and Dow Jones over January 2021 to March 2023, which was the period analysed. The total return of the top 50 was higher than the top 100. The outcomes were the same when they analysed the stock performance of the top 100 companies for stressfree, satisfication, happinness, and purpose individually.\n\nBased on literature, the study discussed 6 potential reasons for these results: productivity, relationships, creativity, health, recruitment, and retention. The discussion is long, so see the study for the full discussion and supporting evidence. For a very brief summary:\n\n* Employee wellbeing was linked to employee performance. Employees with higher wellbeing worked faster, more efficiently, and more effectively.\n* Happier employees developed more supportive relationships with colleagues and supervisors, demonstrated higher capacities for cooperation and collaboration, had more satisfied and loyal customer, and were better negotiators.\n* A wide body of research demonstrated the importance of wellbeing in promoting creativity, generally defined as the production of novel and useful ideas. Happier people had greater mental flexibility and broader awareness, thereby enabling them to make sparse connections and generate original ideas.\n* There was a very strong relationship between wellbeing and health. Poor physical and mental health was linked to reduced work performance primarily due to higher rates of absenteeism and presenteeism. Employees with low job satisfaction have been found to be more likely to leave work early, arrive at work late, and miss days of work entirely.\n* Jobseekers valued employee wellbeing and avoided firms with poor wellbeing, which impacted the ability of firms to attract talent. A study examined the effects of randomly exposing job seekers to information about company happiness levels on Indeed. The experiment involved more than 23 million job seekers in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, and found that job seekers responded behaviorally to this information, by redirecting their applications away from low happiness companies to happier ones. Much of this effect was driven by job seekers “screening out” low happiness firms from their job search. In follow-up analyses, the study found that by improving their score, companies could attract more applications from people viewing the company on the platform.\n* There was a negative relationship between employee wellbeing and turnover. High employee wellbeing predicted lower rates of turnover. Turnover was costly for firms. Estimates of organizational costs associated with turnover from the United States Department of Labor ranged from one half to five times of the workers’ original annual salary. Some of these costs were due to lost productivity, rehiring, retraining, and loss of skill and knowledge \\[1\\]. The annual turnover/separation rates in 2021 and 2022 were 47% \\[2\\]\\[3\\]. In 2019, Gallup estimated US businesses were losing $1 trillion annually due to voluntary turnover \\[4\\].\n\nThe study cited multiple studies for each point, but they only scratched the surface. There was a very large amount of literature on employee wellbeing which basically all supported the relationship between employee wellbeing, productivity, mental health, physical health, turnover, workplace injury, business costs, and etc.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

For example, a meta-analysis\n\nSorry but that’s not how it works and I don’t care if I get downvoted, my degree is statistics so I have to say my part. You need an RCT or similar design to show causation. Having a bunch of observational studies combined into a meta-analysis doesn’t help you show causation. You could combine 1,000 observational studies into a meta-analysis and it wouldn’t matter. To show causation you need to not allow the groups to be assigned by themselves.", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "Is it even possible to design a RCT for something like this? It seems impossible to control all the variables and the setup for a RCT may not be realistic. Though, the study discussed some other studies that seemed relevant.\n\n>A separate stream of research has looked at the effect of happiness on productivity in laboratory experiments. Building on the pioneering work of the late psychologist Alice Isen, who put together a series of laboratory studies on affective states and individual behavior (for example, see: Erez and Isen, 2002; Isen, 1993; Isen and Reeve, 2005), one of the most widely cited pieces of evidence comes from a team of economists, Oswald et al. (2015). In a series of three experiments, participants were exposed to happiness-inducing treatments (including watching ten-minute comedy videos or receiving free food). Control groups were shown placebo clips of neutral footage or nothing at all. Both groups then were asked to perform moderately complex tasks like adding up five two-digit numbers under time pressure, and paid at an incentivized piece rate. In treatment groups, the authors found that comedy videos increased happiness, which then led to subsequent increases in productivity. The happier people became, the more productive they were. On the other hand, participants in control groups did not become happier or more productive. Increases in happiness were associated with a sizeable and significant 12% increase in productivity, demonstrating a causal effect of positive mood on performance.  \n>  \n>Finally, several large-scale field experiments have also found relationships between wellbeing and productivity. In two field experiments, Grant (2008) found evidence for an effect of eudemonic wellbeing (or purpose) on performance. This work shows that fundraising callers who read stories about how their efforts benefited scholarship recipients subsequently more than doubled the amount of money they raised in the following month relative to controls. The author explained the effects in terms of the motivational impact of eudaimonia at work. Callers who came to view their work as more meaningful and purposeful also subsequently became more productive. In two other laboratory experiments, Ariely et al. (2008) found that, even when performing menial tasks, study participants worked harder and were willing to work for less money if their efforts were positively acknowledged by experimenters. Bloom et al. (2015) also found that randomly assigning Chinese call center employees to work from home led to a 13% increase in productivity, as well as higher levels of job satisfaction and positive affect.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "> Is it even possible to design a RCT for something like this?\n\nNot this situation exactly, but tangential situations sure. For example you could have volunteers for your study and randomly assign them to higher or lower paid groups but assign them the same task to see how money impacts their performance. Or you could randomize them to receive 5 breaks versus 2, etc. \n\nLots of studies like that have been done.\n\nTechnically you can’t be sure the results generalize but, it seems reasonable to assert that they should.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I don't think volunteer work would be realistic. I think it's extremely difficult to test it in a real situation. The reason for this is pay, forced overtime, and risk. The company would need the pay the people working less the same and the people working longer more and force overtime. There are major problems with forced overtime:\n\n* the employee may be against it resulting in retaliation or resignment\n* if the person had no extra work, they would just be pointlessly sitting at work doing nothing. This would make it seem like they were less productive during overtime but in reality, they had nothing to do. It would also bore and frustrate the worker.\n\nThe company is taking a large risk from participating.
