You would make less, but your margin requirement are smaller so you could place more to make the same overall or more money for the same risk. My first suggestion is very close to what your strangle would look like if you made it an IC. You could put two on an earn $5.34 with only $2k tied up in buying power.

Doesn't sound like much but given the price of TSLA it can have an impact. Current ATM calls and puts for QQQ are about 165-210 per contract. A savings is 5-8 hundred per contract. \n\nI have pictures of this but can't upload them, but if you look back to TSLA's last earnings you'll see that there was roughly a 10% drop moving the price about $30. QQQ being heavily weighted in TSLA moved 2.3% and fell just shy of $10. The two tickers moved in tandem \n\nSince there are a lot of factors that play in, it can be tough to really figure out how much of a return you would get depending on market variables.

Mirrored affect.\n\nNetflix also has earnings tomorrow, and although only makes up, I think .41% of QQQ, if we get lucky and both Netflix and Tesla tank or explode then it's going to be a great day for QQQ. Of course it would take both working together and if one is up and one is down we'll see a more sideways moment.
