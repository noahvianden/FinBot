{"title": "AutoZone: The Crowded Room", "selftext": "*TLDR;* **Autozone (AZO) is currently valued at $2,500 per share. This is due to its decade-long resistance against splitting its stock. However, its balance sheet sheds light on a company that is hemorrhaging money quickly and has shaky fundamentals at best. In the future, AutoZone may be forced to dilute current shareholders risking a mutiny by its 94% institutional holders. With low liquidity and a high level of institutional investing, any fund that begins to sell out of its position will potentiate a downward spiral. For this reason, I believe that AZO is currently grossly overvalued even at its current EPS and analyst forecasts. AutoZone reports earnings on 02/28 which I believe will lead to AZO's decline in valuation.** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe argument can be made that, at any given time a stock is valued precisely as it should be. Every seller must have a buyer willing to pay the quoted price. It is up to the investor's discretion, however, whether or not they are willing to place a similar value on the security being offered. In looking at the stock valuation of Autozone (AZO), I will try to summarize how this principle has led investors to grossly overpay for a company that is most likely hemorrhaging money.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ctux814zpcia1.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&s=52a2de6edbfcf496d83f06427b99f80fbfaa8480\n\nHere we have AutoZone's (AZO) stock summary. Ignoring the +36,936% increase in stock valuation since the early '90s, we can see that AZO has maintained a modest amount of shares outstanding for being such a seasoned company. The $2,546 per stock valuation reflects the company's avoidance of performing any stock splits since 1994. Similar to Berkshire Hathaway's strategy, avoiding stock splits allows for a decreased dilution of shares and ultimately more value returned to shareholders per stock held (in theory).\n\nThe daily volume of shares exchanged per day is typically low, and it takes fewer shares to move the price of the stock. This strategy also has the added benefit of boosting EPS, as earnings are not spread as thinly across millions of shares. AZO's PE ratio is 21.38, which is moderately high but does not raise too many red flags. Therefore, on the surface, it looks like a solid company with astounding earnings and a flawless track record. \n\nBut when we dig deeper into AZO's balance sheet, we find some concerning abnormalities.\n\n  \n\n[Earnings typically peak in August and Bottom in February](https://preview.redd.it/wjr6c23bscia1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=b15857bd430cc0d7cad1be7cdbd0916e6877bc0e)\n\nI don't prefer to use revenue alone as a means of gauging a company's solvency, as it often doesn't provide a comprehensive explanation of its operations. Operating income is much more comprehensive and equates to *Revenue - Cost of Revenue - Operating Expenses*. This provides a much clearer picture of **how much money a company is actually making from their business.** For AZO, earnings typically peak in August and decline during the Winter months. A decline during this time period is not abnormal. What is abnormal is that AZO's revenue trend is starting to *reverse direction.* This past November's earnings were lower than the year prior, yet the valuation of the stock still implies that the market is pricing in an upward trend.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1ybyy44ucia1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=6aec34e9d15339100c1dad50971678c9b10af5f4\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[2020 SEC filing showing that issue of $1.2b in notes was responsible for the injection of cash](https://preview.redd.it/91a7tppqvcia1.png?width=1432&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a075ecfbc43bac6ada875bf093da9d12b978280)\n\nCash and Cash equivalents can give us insight into how much liquid capital a company has quick access to if necessary. For the quarter that ended in November 2021, this liquid capital came back down to pre-pandemic levels. This tells us that the large sum of cash raised by issuing notes was quickly spent. It is concerning that such a large sum of money only held them over for a few quarters and without another similar injection, I see them burning through the remaining cash very quickly.  \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x8hjnxu4ycia1.png?width=1464&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ce98e8efbb75ba3ece0fe10411753922fd13eba\n\nAZO's balance sheet also shows that liabilities are quickly outpacing assets. This is not uncommon, especially for companies that are based out of brick-and-mortar locations. However, This does not leave them much room for error when managing their balance sheet.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e27rgp3nzcia1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4839cd9414466f1bcdd2f55671ec25ce4ad6f5e\n\nTo emphasize the severity of the hemorrhage, AutoZone's working capital currently sits at ***-$2b***. It should be noted that some industries require more working capital than others as their operations aren't as liquid and may not be able to generate short-term capital quickly from customers. Even with this in mind, for the past 2 years, AutoZone has been operating far below its typical threshold for working capital requirements. \n\nSimply put, AutoZone has never been this strapped for cash in the history of the company. ***Yet its stock valuation is still sitting around its all-time high.*** \n\nSo then, what is AZO's true value?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p5qgagq81dia1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=c35e8af2f8ee224a0712b978122c6ad486cde4b2\n\nAlthough book value is not always an accurate metric for gauging the value of a company, it still provides some important information. Book value is typically measured as the sum of a company's assets less its liabilities assuming they can be sold. If AutoZone was to hypothetically sell all of its assets and pay off its outstanding obligations *today*, this metric would give us the value investors could expect their shares to be worth. Their shares wouldn't actually yield -$176 to state the obvious, but it does show how deep the bullet lies. \n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d1j1ryh53dia1.png?width=452&format=png&auto=webp&s=62249fe838f78ad8c999041bddbfebdd2ee4268e\n\nUltimately, this is not a \"doom and gloom\" post about how I believe AZO is plummeting toward insolvency. I just cannot imagine any justification for a $2,500/share valuation of a company that has the balance sheet of a penny stock. The numbers are larger, sure, but the ratios are eerily similar. This isn't the first stock that I have seen with a grossly inflated valuation, but it is a staple of many mutual funds, trusts, and ETFs. In a risk-off market environment or if macroeconomic sentiment shifts, I can see it as one of the first to go. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Control is wholly owned by institutions](https://preview.redd.it/x0r6ldes5dia1.png?width=1107&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ae53b1810420419828fd215a4e380fcb721901d)\n\n[AZO appears to play a key role in many mutual funds](https://preview.redd.it/t25pydnp5dia1.png?width=1472&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ce6a3e9efba7e234978ce812f0bd46653ae0188)\n\nBecause funds have been building positions for decades and holding shares, AutoZone has historically been immune to significant downside swings or price volatility in previous years. However, their balance sheet expresses that there are some pretty significant reasons for funds to re-evaluate if they truly want to continue holding a hemorrhaging company.\n\nSo far the path for AutoZone's stock has been a straight line, but all good things must come to an end. Gravity will bring it back down to Earth. With an average daily volume profile of around \\~100,000 shares, the most pain will come in the form of low liquidity. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iq1xblbc7dia1.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=77f1c15e251630d48e49da700dc50f86e97fbf49\n\nWith 94% of shares owned by institutions, any firm that chooses to sell out of its position will potentiate a downward spiral.

From there you can ask a qualitative question: How *reliable* are the earnings of this business?\n\nThat will get you the answer of whether or not the debt presents a serious risk.\n\nTake my favorite example recently, Spectrum (Charter Communications). They have a whopping, staggering, mind-boggling amount of long-term debt. They're also an internet utility (regional monopoly) who raises prices like clockwork every year. They have been able to do so for the past 20+ years - ever since my area got cable internet.\n\nThe debt they carry is almost all fixed rate, long out into the future, and at salivating rates. 2%, 3%.

New share issue only makes sense if the company is selling at a significant premium.\n\nSo if you - as a shareholder - believe the company is currently selling at a large premium, issuing new shares that can do something productive (eliminate expensive debt, fund profitable expansion, etc.) can be an intelligent move for a business.\n\nAZO could be fully priced, or more.

{"title": "Buy the dip continues… 2-15-23 SPY/ ES Futures and Tesla Daily Market Analysis", "selftext": "Today was another one of those days where it was a clear buy the dip narrative. However, it was clearly not presented that way yet again. Now I know basically for the last week or 2 its been every dip is a rip… and honestly IF you went into the day with only the mentality that every dip is an opportunity for a call and you didn’t look at any other technicals or supporting evidence then you would probably be profitable. \n\nHowever, these sell offs are becoming more and more convincing and more and more supported from a technical standpoint. This isnt just a small retrace in price action to reconfirm support. These are pretty large retraces taking out major support and having a lot of supporting technical that they will continue. However, much like yesterday as soon as those technical show continuation we are getting absolutely rogue out of no where rips and then eventually technical come back to support the bull side. \n\nIT has become increasingly frustrating to trade SPY over the last 2 weeks now. There is absolutely no continuation and the technicals just don’t make a whole lot of sense at all. Major supports/ resistances breaking with support of price action and technicals are seeing rogue reversals before we finally get the actual movement one would expect. \n\nThe more I look at the last 2 weeks of price action we are stuck in a range. However, this range is heavily being held together by the buy the dip narrative. There has been countless opportunities and supporting evidence of a large correction sub 405 coming on SPY since last week and we still manage to stay afloat some how. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6gyse9vbcfia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=82cbd8cff82815dd9150296783cc21a2ba5a57a7\n\nWe do get some more data in the AM with initial jobless claims and PPI. Will be curious if this PPI final demand expected a 0.4% with a previous of -0.5% will be negatively received… the feds have said how much they rely on PPI so a hotter or rebounding PPI COULD potentially finally see a retrace. \n\nBut that’s only if the buy the dip narrative ends… \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/za8k35dccfia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=233070694e482f6454cf8d72ef4172148fe3b786\n\nLooking at SPY here that range I am referring to since February 1st is 405 to 417. \n\nOverall we haven’t broken through either of those levels over the last 11 trading days now. The question still does remain 420 or 405 next? The case for 420 grows in my opinion. \n\nSomething I wanted to highlight here on SPY was the post CPI trends from December and January. In December we had that CPI day that resulted in that massive candle. The following day we closed a small red day and then the day after that was a massive red day. Looking at January we had that range day much like this previous CPI yesterday. The next day was a bullish engulfing day (much like today). The following day resulted in a reversal doji that then was proceeded by a huge sell off. \n\nI will be curious to see if this trend continues or not. \n\nWhen we look at the daily we have an 8ema bounce and we have a bullish engulfing candle candle… that SHOULD push SPY higher and possibly retest that critical 417 resistance. That would be my target tomorrow if markets don’t negatively react to that data. \n\nWe are still in that breakout triangle with support at 409.5 and resistance at 414.4.\n\nKey SPY Support- 410.2 -> 408.6 -> 405.4\n\nKey SPY Resistance- 414.1 -> 416.8 -> 419.5\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t65q56vccfia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fc0e37b414720b36eda3f05748a3dad9a19884e\n\nFutures shows quite the consolidation here itself too but what futures shows that SPY doesn’t show very much of is these massive wicks to the downside. This means that futures is seeing some pretty impressive sell offs after hours/ during market close, however, intraday is pumping back up. \n\nThis has happened quite a few times before and this usually signifies that eventually a change of tide is coming… \n\nI have noticed a lot times when after hours/ futures don’t match the intraday movement of Spy there is an imbalance in the markets… in my opinion generally speaking futures is rarely wrong… it just takes them some times to be right. \n\nTaking a look here we are holding that same consolidation on futures as spy from 4085 to 4193. \n\nWe remain also in this breakout wedge pattern here with tomorrows resistance being at 4180 and support being at 4105.\n\nKey levels to watch though that we have seen a lot of price action at is 4123 support and 4178 resistance. \n\nKey Futures Support- 4140 -> 4123 -> 4105\n\nKey Futures Resistance- 4160 -> 4178 -> 4193\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q4s734edcfia1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5ccc681c59e7b098d3fd7c6e7fe76567b6ec294\n\nSomewhat surprising today Tesla actually didn’t show a lot of strength… it held within a fairly tight $2 closing range for a large portion of the day. However, after a sell off during Bidens speech it found all the strength it needed and made a massive push up to close at that key 215 daily 200ema resistance area. \n\nTesla did close out a classic hanging man candle which could result in a drop tomorrow. However, with Spy and Tesla both finishing at their HODs tomorrow we could be set up for a large push up tomorrow. \n\nI still believe its far too early to short tesla but I also believe whenever this buy the dip narrative pops Tesla will be the ultimate short. \n\nKey Tesla Support- 209.5 -> 202.8 -> 197.2 -> 191.9\n\nKey Tesla Resistance- 215 -> 219.1 -> 226.1 -> 229.8\n\n  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l272qyvgcfia1.png?width=636&format=png&auto=webp&s=4feb695274013eef10cffc321605ad554125df7a\n\nInteresting close here on the VIX today back under that key pivot level of 18.3… If we look at the VIX this is only the second time in over 13 months that the VIX has CLOSED below 18.3… Everytime since January that the VIX has closed under 18.3 the following day the VIX has had a very large rebound. \n\nJanuary 13th -> January 17th 5.51% VIX rebound and -0.18% red day followed by -1.58% red day for SPY  \n January 27th -> January 30th 7.73% VIX rebound and -1.25% red day for SPY   \n February 1st -> February 2nd 4.82% VIX rebound and 1.46% green day for spy followed by -1% red day  \n February 3rd -> February 6th 6% VIX rebound and -0.61% red day for SPY\n\nWhat is actually the most interesting about this pattern is that all but one of those has happened over a weekend. \n\nMost of the rebounds on VIX resulted in a simultaneous red day for SPY but two times it was one day later. \n\nSpeaking of SPY drops here is some fun facts… \n\nSPY has not put in 3 red days in a row since January 17-19th. Before that the last 3 red days in a row came December 14th to 17th. Both of these were immediately proceeding CPI results. \n\nSpy has only closed back to back red days 6 total times in the last 39 trading days… \n\nWe also have only close > -2% one time since November 9th which was over 3 months ago now. \n\nWith 11 trading days of consolidation within about a $10 range we are very soon going to see a move up or down. \n\n**Daily log-** \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/plffyzohcfia1.png?width=839&format=png&auto=webp&s=229c017601eb32ef9a2e5a1df02f0e183ad6895f\n\nStarted the day off fairly well today. Got burnt in that morning call on a failed breakout… I cut early at -7.6% which was the right move as we had a very large correction then. From there I made a few more nice trades and then I got absolutely burnt by the market. \n\nI took a call around noon at what looked like the perfect support bounce at a key level only for the bottom to fall out on me. l then took a put around 1230 after SPY looked like it was confirming resistance and pretty much every indicator I have screamed puts only for SPY to get an absolute rogue shrek and of course wrecked that put. \n\nHighly frustrating trading lately. Actually put in my 3rd red day in a row here in a very long time. I looked back through my logs and honestly I couldn’t even find a time that I had 3 red days in a row between now and last May. Quite a few back to back red days but even during my terrible drawdown in July to September I didn’t put in 3 red days in a row. Definitely struggling this week with this price action and these reversals/ fake outs but we just keep on trucking. \n\nIt would be impossible for every day, week or month to be green.
