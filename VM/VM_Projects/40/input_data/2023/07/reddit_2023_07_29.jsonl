Libre will take market share when the libre can be used with the pumps, so I suspect with this soon, Libre has the advantage (especially since the sensor lasts 14 days instead of 10 like dexcom).

Abbott is 14 days and Dexcom 10, but Dexcom has applications with the FDA to extend this to 15. Abbott has more of a worldwide presence than Dexcom and has way more political influence. Freestyle Libre 3 is smaller than the g7 which is a plus when considering the children with diabetes.\nDexcom was first to mass market so many endocrinologists still prefer them due to habit of prescribing.\nI think the main thing to consider here is that Abbott isn't just diabetes and can get dragged down (or up) by other divisions performance. Their diabetes division is the best performing by far. Dexcom is a pure diabetes play and has lost an overwhelming amount of market share to Abbott. When sensors are OTC in 4 years or so, then it will be all about marketing, which Abbott will win.\nJust my 2 cents...either way you invest, it's with a company helping people and that's just cool in itself.

Just because we all have achieved enlightenment doesn't mean there still aren't Blind, Deaf, and dumb fools out there who have yet to experience SERIOUSLY TREASONOUS AMOUNTS OF GAINS.  We must be good shepherds of this TERRIBLE and AWESOME POWER, God didnt bestow this blessing on us to hoard for ourselves, we must share the power for the very betterment of mankind. \n\nto dispense with the pleasantries, its time we discussed the TACTICAL PAUSE. We know the STAG WHEEL is versatile, bending and contouring to each traitors individual needs, but the tactical pause is a fantastic tool to add to your toolbelt and will make you a more robust and nimble TRAITOR. \n\nA tactical pause can be taken at any time, at any length, and for any reason. The most common reason i employ the technique is in lead ups to particularly meaningful earnings. As most of you know, i have a curent STAG WHEEL running on PLTR, and this week, looking over the premium and the expected move of the underlying, I have all but decided to employ a tactical pause.\n\nThe technique is simple, simply sell no new contracts on your positions until the event has passed. With earnings so near, the stock recently staging a turn around, and a lot of upside left to reach prior highs, its far too possible that the stock will skyrocket after this earnings. I would hate to have an open contract near the money when that happens, its better to let the earnings hit, if its positive, let it make its move up, and sell into the new highs set by the news.\n\nOf course its entirely possible the opposite happens and the stock tanks, in which case i will miss the oppourtunity to collect a weeks worth of premium. At .38 per contract, im prepared to take that risk in order to protect my upside. The premium is extra juicy now because earnings is so near, and if this wasnt such a pivotal report, i would likely just take the elevated premium.\n\nEither way, i will likely resume selling contracts a day or two after earnings.
