{"title": "China’s Export Curbs Pose Grave Threat to Nvidia’s $1 Trillion Market Cap, Sending Shockwaves Through the Global Tech Industry", "selftext": "China is the world’s leading producer of gallium and germanium, making any reduction in its output a significant concern for the global tech industry. The limited availability of these metals is likely to slow down production or result in increased prices for manufacturers and their clients in the technology, telecommunications, energy, and automotive sectors. As gallium and germanium are alternatives to traditional silicon wafers in specialized applications, their scarcity could disrupt the supply chain, impacting the production capabilities of companies reliant on these materials.\n\nGallium and germanium are among dozens of minerals classified by the US government as critical to economic and national security. The US state department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to officials and experts in China, Beijing is expected to introduce further retaliatory measures in response to the expansion of US-led controls on technology exports.\n\n“There will be more retaliatory measures against the snowballing semiconductor export controls from western countries,” said one senior official close to the Chinese commerce ministry.\n\nConsidering Nvidia is expected to hit 11B+ in revenue for the next quarter, going from 7billion to 11billion considering their already complicated supply chain issues and this is only going to worsen the issue and make it harder for them to meet that expectation. \n\nNvidia is now “priced for perfection.” The bears can point to pretty much any risk and have a valid point. as a dominant player in the semiconductor industry, Nvidia is far from immune to the potential consequences of China’s export curbs. The company’s market cap of $1 trillion is largely based on its leadership in AI Chips. Nvidia could face significant challenges in maintaining its market dominance and growth trajectory.\n\nThe restrictions could impede the company’s access to critical components and hinder its ability to supply AI chips to the Chinese market, which is a major consumer of these technologies. Such restrictions would not only impact Nvidia’s revenue but also create an opportunity for competitors to gain market share in China and beyond.\n\nKim Yang-paeng, a researcher at the Korea Institute for Industrial Economics and Trade, said the restrictions were “worrisome” for South Korean chipmakers.\n\n“Korean companies can find alternative sources, but it will take some time . . . if you lack some materials, no matter how important they are, this could hit chip production,” he said.\n\nBased on historical precedents, supply chain disruptions and export curbs have often resulted in market volatility and reduced investor confidence. If Nvidia faces difficulties in sourcing essential materials and encounters restrictions on selling AI chips to China, it could face a decline in market capitalization. The loss of Chinese customers alone, given their significant demand for AI chips, could have a substantial impact on Nvidia’s revenue and market value. Additionally, heightened geopolitical tensions may deter investors and hinder Nvidia’s expansion plans, further eroding its market cap.\n\nChina’s export curbs on gallium and germanium, along with the potential limitations on AI chip exports, pose a serious threat to Nvidia’s ability to maintain its $1 trillion market cap. The disruption to the global supply chain, which was just starting to recover. The tech sector in particular, and the uncertainty surrounding future market dynamics could undermine Nvidia’s growth and market dominance.\n\nThe recent move by China to impose export restrictions on gallium and germanium, essential metals used in chipmaking and communications equipment, has intensified the geopolitical tensions between China and the United States. These measures, aimed at safeguarding national security and interests, signify a retaliatory response to the semiconductor restrictions imposed by the US. While China’s actions may have short-term implications for Chinese manufacturers, the long-term consequences will undermine Nvidia’s ability to maintain its $1 trillion market cap.\n\nSource: https://www.ft.com/content/6dca353c-70d8-4d38-a368-b342a6450d95 [Financial Times]\n\nSource: China’s metal export curbs reverberate across Asia’s chip sector https://on.ft.com/43947NW [Financial Times]", "id": "14puhvn", "created_utc": 1688417586.0, "score": 56, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 41, "comments": [{"body": "Short NVDA   \nIt’s gotta pay out this time for sure guys. /s", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "I keep a running list of narratives for $SPY, $QQQ, every sector SPDR, semiconductors, Chinese stocks, and a few select companies. “Chinese counter sanctions” has been on my running list of narratives since the days when Tariff Man dominated the market.

It is projected that supply chain constraints resulting from the shortage could lead to a significant decline in NVDA stock, potentially tumbling by 30%.\n\nGallium, a crucial element used in the semiconductor industry, plays a vital role in the manufacturing process of various electronic devices. With NVDA being a global leader in the production of high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs), any disruption in the supply of gallium would undoubtedly have a profound effect on their operations.\n\nExperts have predicted that the current supply chain constraints caused by the gallium shortage may lead to production delays and inadequate inventory levels for NVDA. These issues could result in decreased product availability, increased production costs, and potential customer dissatisfaction.\n\nAdditionally, the scarcity of gallium has a domino effect, affecting other companies within the tech industry that rely on this essential element for their semiconductor products. As a result, competitors of NVIDIA may also face similar challenges, leading to market instability and further exacerbating the decline in stock prices.\n\nAddressing the ongoing gallium shortage poses significant challenges for NVDA. The company must explore alternative sources or develop advanced supply chain strategies to mitigate the potential impact on their operations and maintain the trust of their shareholders and customers.\n\nIndustry analysts are closely monitoring the situation and advising investors to exercise caution regarding NVDA stock in light of these developments. The potential 30% decline in stock prices underscores the urgency for stakeholders to keep a close eye on supply chain constraints and monitor the company's efforts in finding viable solutions.\n\nFor more information and updates on the gallium shortage and its implications for NVDA stock, please contact our media relations department at [Contact Information].\n\n###\n\nAbout [Your Company]:\n[Your Company] is a leading provider of news and insights in the finance and technology sectors.

{"title": "Mom, dad: I'm a Bear", "selftext": "Let me start by saying I wasn't born a Bear, I turned into one.\n\nYou might wonder what made me, or not, who gives a fuck, but I will tell my story anyway.\n\nI started ~~gambling~~ investing because I saw my income (far from being minimum wage) was never going to take me anywhere, perhaps retire at 65 with a shitty pension, and my money would lose value by keeping it under the mattress. So I googled how to become financially independent.\n\nEveryone said I had to invest. I went to the bank and the chick there (a very hot one, by the way) recommended to start with a mutual fund. I used the money I had left from my first paychecks. I followed advice and deposited every month religiously since that's what a good ~~gambler~~ investor does. Everything was going ok, I saw my account and felt really happy to see my money grow. That's the first time my brain tasted money-related-dopamine release.\n\nThen my first drop happened, I felt devastated, I lost part of my hard earned money. Once again I went to Google Financial Advisor and he said that's normal, that I had to keep invested and that by DCAing I would offset my losses, time in the Market is more important than timing the market.\n\nMy curiosity didn't stop there, I learned more and more. I checked my bank's mutual funds I and felt overwhelmed by the variety they had, didn't know where to begin. I read the KIID's of the ones that drew my attention, those that were going to the moon and those that were crushed. Since I couldn't decide and the internet said diversification was an important part of ~~gambling~~ investing, I took a few of them.\n\nI observed how they behaved: the ones mooning kept mooning, the ones crushed had one of those V recoveries and others were mehhh. This is fun, I told myself. Meanwhile my money kept growing. Also I'm pretty suspicious and thought: this is too easy, any moron can get rich this way. We're still in the easy money era.\n\nMy first bear market. Never saw a dump so brutal. I thought I would never recover, still, the Fed bailed me out. That was my \"stonks only go up\" moment. By then I had stopped DCAing religiously, when I saw my funds mooning, I waited and saved cash ready to be deployed into new my brilliant and original idea: buy the ~~fucking~~ dip. My margins were good, but my brain had developed dopamine tolerance to see my money updated once a day, I was ready to take the next step.\n\nI wanted to invest in that new company everyone was talking about, now I needed a broker. My bank had a good reputation but the trader platform was a little limited. As the responsible ~~gamble~~ investor that I am, I did a thorough research to choose one, in the end I didn't want to be Bear Stearnsed or Lehmaned.\n\nThere were a lot of stonks to choose from, so I put in practice my new skills and decided to buy the dip in a company I liked and knew. I didn't have to wait a week and it had already V'ed. \"I'm a fucking genius, Warren Buffet can suck my dick\". I would be having butthole cocaine parties in no time. I took my profits and waited for the next dip to buy.\n\nWell, I bought into a company that dipped but didn't V, au contraire, it kept dumping. This is totally new for me. You can lose money with stonks?! Lesson learned: cut your losses.\n\nI looked at charts and the kept going up and up, stonks really only go up. Come on, this can't be true. There must have been times in the past when you got really fucked and ruined. I studied about crashes, what caused them and if you can profit on the way up, you can profit on the way down: shorting. I unleashed my inner MJB. That was the first time I went Bear. Once you go bear you can never go back.\n\nValuations were sky high, and while I didn't short immediately, did take profit and went into cash. It was a relief to see a steady amount in my account and not watching tickers every minute; unfortunately that shit kept going up. I felt rage, everyone else was getting rich and my fucking cash stayed the same. I wanted to take vengeance, I shorted tha fuck out of it. \n\nTurns out I timed it pretty well, but I was a fucking pussy and used only a small amount. \"Infinite losses when shorting\", I was pretty afraid of that. Next victim, I took a larger amount and got profit but pulled out too early and that shit kept dumping, still a fucking pussy. Sometimes I got roasted, lost my earnings and went back to where I started, got greedy that time. Kids: leverage is a dangerous thing. JPow wasn't going to save stonks this time, in fact, he was trashing the party and Putin also helped. Inflation had fucked everything up and easy money era was off.\n\n2022 and I got rich while everyone was sucking dicks behind Wendy's. Enter 2023, took profits from last year but I thought: this bitch is going down; so I started to slowly grow my short position, I had learned from previous mistakes. Bank crisis: this is it! JPow and his ~~bailout~~ backstop fucked me, still structural problems remained and it was a matter of time... AI hype: what tha fuck is this shit? This is a pumped up Siri/Cortana, we know how that's going.\n\nI'm not in shambles, didn't yolo, but still hurt. The crash is coming, there are way more reasons for it tha not, just hope to have money to profit from it. Like my pal 50 says \"get rich or die tryin'\".
