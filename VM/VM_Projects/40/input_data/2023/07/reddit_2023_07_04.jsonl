I mean, the questions posed by you seem to be already assuming the answer.\n\n1. It doesn't work for most users all the time.  It works for a few users some of the time.  For me, it's maybe 95% on the highway?  It nearly ran off the road driving through the mountains of Utah just last week because it is too curvy and it doesn't slow down enough for highway curves.  And on the city/streets? Maybe 60% of the time.  \n\n2. Declaring something not in beta means that Tesla believes they have delivered the software as intended and expected.  \"Feature Complete\".  So yes, it's semantics but also speaks to when Tesla thinks its not a beta. I think the test will probably be a coast to coast drive with no driver disengagements.  But regardless, the loss of the \"Beta\" moniker will most likely be the moment Tesla starts recognizing 100% of the revenue.  So yes, it's dependent solely on Tesla thinking it's got its MVP of whatever it says is Tesla FSD.  \n\n3. Uhhh...this has nothing to do with counting revenue.  But it will be a very ugly PR moment if they declare it out of beta in its current format.  Accidents will happen all the time and people will sue.  \n\n4.
