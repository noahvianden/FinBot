Indicators are not as important because most of them are lagging.

For me support and resistance levels are probably my most important indicators.  If I know these levels, I can quickly analyze current behavior and deduce where the stock may go.  There's a reason why these indicators are called support and resistance.  They behave the way they sound.  Stock finds support...that means it's being supported at X level and cannot breakdown any further at the moment.  Resistance is the opposite for breaking out.  Pivot points are another good one for day trading, as they act like support and resistance.  I would call these more leading indicators because they tell you where the stock might go.
