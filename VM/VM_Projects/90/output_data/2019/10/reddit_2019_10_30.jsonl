MacBook/iPad sales - most likely flat.\n#2. iPhone sales - ???? Unknown.\n#3. Apple Arcade - ???? (Laughable in my opinion).\n#4. AppleTV+ Streaming - most likely not going to be big driver of revenue. Rumors are their content line-up is poor. Their cost of building the streaming service was probably expensive. \n\nRelative to the billions they earn with their existing business, the streaming service revenues will be negligible.\n\nStock price has run up from $200 to $245 in a short period of time. I don\u2019t see this going much higher on earnings beat (they normally beat).\n\nMy estimate is going to be:\n\nBEAT - Up 3-4% ($250-255 range).\nMISS - Slapped back down to $230s.\n\nAny body else want to share?", "id": "dpaf74", "created_utc": 1572459134.0, "score": 32, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "Don't forget the upgraded airpods that go on sale this Friday.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "But they look the same.
