This was a 2 day burst, most of the profit taking already took place yesterday. For example, ark unloaded a ton yesterday, and I'm sure more people holding into the ER did as well. There are a lot of new buyers picking up what profit takers are unloading.\n\nBarring major news, I don't see a dip coming till after Q4 at least.
