{"title": "AMZN earnings report and the 5th anniversary of me being dumb", "selftext": "AMZN's missed earnings report from yesterday has me \"reminiscing\" about another missed earnings report, how I squandered a massive opportunity, and how I still haven't learned my lesson.\n\nThe year was 2014, and AMZN had been trading in the low-mid 300 range all year after hitting an all-time high of \\~400 in January, so it was a bit of a down year.  I don't remember exactly what was going on inside the company at the time, but then, on 23 October 2014, it missed on earnings and the price \"plummeted\" the next day, trading in the 280s/290s.  \n\nOn that day, it just so happened that I was kind of stranded in the middle of Camp Pendleton with shyte signal, no computers anywhere nearby, and busy AF running a 75-person detachment on 24 hour operations.  It was only a coincidence that I saw the AMZN news because it had been reported in mainstream media and I got an alert on my phone.  I had been watching the company for a few months and thought to myself, what a great day to buy!  They will certainly recover, this company is solid.   \n\nSo I whip out my phone, but I didn't have my brokerage app installed... I've only had a smartphone for two years at this point and still wasn't comfortable putting my financial-related apps on there.  But I said to myself, screw it, you can't miss this opportunity.  So I try downloading the app... but, again, shyte signal... download failed.  Try again... download failed.  I tried this for about an hour until while things were quiet, then everything got busy again and I had to abandon my quest to download the app.  \n\nNext thing I know, market is closed, ahhh damn I missed my chance I say to myself.  I get home from camp Pendleton two weeks later and see that the price has now \"recovered\" to 300+ and I figure, oh well not going to buy it now.  \n\nYeah, so I know everyone has their \"one that got away\" but hot-damn it's not always so easy to pinpoint the moment in time when it happened.  And I would have held it... I'm a long-term investor.  So yeah, that's my unsolicited sob story.\n\nIn any case, I haven't learned my lesson because even though AMZN stock price will plummet again today due to missed earnings, I'm not going to buy it... I'll never be able to decouple my emotions from that stock, I'll just let my ETFs and MFs with AMZN holdings deal with it for now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TLDR**; Exactly five years ago, AMZN missed on earnings and I missed a chance to buy it in the 280s because of no phone signal, then gave up hope when it increased to 300-something... like a moron.", "id": "dmwox2", "created_utc": 1572006195.0, "score": 188, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "About a decade ago, I bought 100 shares of AMZN at 99.
