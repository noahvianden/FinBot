You must pay back this debt + interest no matter what happens with he price of your purchased asset (otherwise you default...and that\u2019s really bad).  The use of margin amplifies returns to equity and, by extension, the variance of your position...higher variance = higher risk. \n\nSo, if you have $100 of equity and can borrow $100...you can fund a $200 position. If the asset appreciates by 10%, you have a 20% ROE. The opposite is true if the asset depreciates. The reason why positions get forcibly closed is that you are supposed to maintain a minimum amount of equity. If you are required to maintain $50 in equity and the asset falls by 25% ($50) you will face a margin call - you can either liquidate the position to pay your debt or pay in new capital to increase your equity. This forced selling can be disadvantageous because it is generally done at the lows...\n\nAnyways. Check out investopedia and other resources to bone up on this.

To you, the person that is long an equity, you are correct the total return of owning the equity does not change \\*much\\* i.e. there is nothing \"magical about dividends\" as I stated above.-- (the \"friction\" of taxes makes it less than even when a dividend is paid out, so that dollar in dividends paid to you is really 80-85 cents on the dollar).  But that aspect not withstanding, you own said shares (minus the dividend) plus the cash dividend distributed so that is close to a wash from your perspective as a current owner.  \n\nHowever, say you own a stock trading at $50 and they declare a $1 dividend.  On the day the equity trades \"ex-dividend\", i.e. the new buyers of said security are not entitled to that $1 declared dividend, all else being equal, the stock will begin trading at roughly $49.  And this makes sense when thought through logically.  All else held equal, a company will necessarily trade at a discount to what is being paid out in cash.  I mean why would a NEW BUYER bid the exact same price for the equity when x dollars have just been taken from the company and given to someone that is not said bidder??  They wouldn't.  A lot of times its not that noticeable, as quarterly dividends aren't really that big. --I mean on any given day would you think much about one of your holdings opening down .50 cents or something??  And it's not to say by close of business the underlying equity won't have overcome that .50 cent \"hurdle\" and turn green for the day due to some other event.  But as an example you can see it quite evidently when companies pay out special one time large dividends.  I included an article from WSJ on MSFTs 2004 special dividend to see a more pronounced impact of what happens to a stock when a large amount of cash is distributed out.  It is likely behind WSJ's paywall so hopefully you are able to see.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd you can make the example as easy as say you were going to buy a McDonalds stand.  And all else held equal the partners (shareholders) of that McDonalds stand decide they want to take a cash distribution for whatever reason before close.  Your bid, for that McDonalds stand, all else equal, will be lowered by the amount of cash distribution.    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd salut to you for earning your living off the dividends, Cornelius Vanderbilt style.
