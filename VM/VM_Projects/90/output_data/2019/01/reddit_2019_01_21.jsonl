The idea is that price moves quickly and for a long distance when it exits a trading range. But what is a trading range? The creator thought that if price made a new 20-day extreme, that would be a likely start of a new trend.\n\nFor example, the Dow was in a trading range from 10/11/18 to 12/10/18. On 12/10, price made a new 20 day low that would start a short position. A 3x Average True Range trailing stop would've been used. A few days later, the trading range broke and price rocketed down. The Turtle system would've added onto an already profitable position as it dropped. The position would've been stopped out in profit on 12/26 or 12/27.\n\nThe system doesn't predict anything.
