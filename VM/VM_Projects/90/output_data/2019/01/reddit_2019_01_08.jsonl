And you see that as a bad thing? Why? Companies dream of that kind of pricing power. \n\n\n>Recently Apple announced that it will stop disclosing iPhone and iPad shipments.\n\nI agree this is a bad move, but only because I like how Wallstreet overreacts to iPhone unit sales and periodically places AAPL on sale. If you\u2019re valuing AAPL based on how many units it sold in a particular quarter, you\u2019re looking at it wrong.\n\n>Apple has done a good job of selling digital goods (apps, movies, music, space) in its digital store, but so far it has proved to be a lousy services company.\n\nI think that\u2019s fair. It is frustrating how my Apple Watch only works with Apple Maps, and Apple Maps is retarded. I think Apple Pay is fine though. \n\n>Apple\u2019s streaming music service was initially a disaster. In all fairness, it has improved, but today it is fighting an uphill battle because Apple\u2019s walled-garden approach doesn\u2019t allow Apple Music to work on Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s speakers. This gave plenty of breathing room for competitors, who otherwise would not have had a chance.\n\nApple Music was late to the show, so Im not sure I agree with your last sentence. As for the walled-garden, news just came out this morning that Apple Music and iTunes will be available on non-Apple devices. https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/08/fall-icurtain-apple-itunes-samsung-smart-tv\n\n>Then there is Siri. \n\nSiri is dogshit.\n\n>It needs a new huge product category. (The Apple Watch was a mildly successful product, but in the context of $265 billion of sales, it was a rounding error.) A car was supposed to be that category \u2014 it\u2019s the largest product category globally \u2014 but, according to the New York Times, Apple has changed its car strategy several times and has basically given up on that category.\n\nThe car would have been a disaster. If AAPL had listened to Wallstreet, they would have sold TVs for christ\u2019s sake. Im glad they\u2019ve chosen to stick with the iPhone and release add-ons like the Watch and AirPods that make it better and stickier. \n\n>When Apple stock was lower, we did not have to worry as much about slower growth, but now we do \u2014 so we got out.\n\nIm not here to say your conclusion is wrong, but what I will say is every one of your reasons has been around for years, so why are you selling now? If you believe it\u2019s over priced at $150, why didn\u2019t you sell it when it was over $200?

Apple is trying to have their cake and eat it too, charging users out the nose for entering the ecosystem and then milking more cash out of them via services. I don't think they can be successful in both at the same time. And I don't think Apple can change their business to become a services giant that can capture users in the same way that the more successful players have, not without alienating their existing users who paid the large fee to get into the Apple ecosystem.
