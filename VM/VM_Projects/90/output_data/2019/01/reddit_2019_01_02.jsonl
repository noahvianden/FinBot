{"title": "trading with small amounts", "selftext": "How do you guys scratch your itch when you see a promising stock but dont have the money to fully take advantage of it? I'm more of a long-term investor, buy and hold forever with compounding interest but lately, I've seen a  few potential short-term buy and sell stocks (Eg: I'm keeping an eye on GE) that have some promise... but I dont have a large enough sum to make the profits even worth it after commissions (I live in Canada, so Robinhood is a no go).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCurrently, my portfolio is built on long-term stocks and ETF's (DIS, ENB, SPHD, VGRO, VXUS and ZLB) which I re-invest all dividends back in - it's \\~$1700 between them all. I'm 25, so I have PLENTY of time to keep adding into these for the long run... but how do you invest your money in small amounts?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI put \\~$200/month into investments (yes i know its not alot, no there is no other way to put more in, ive done the spreadhseets, i dont have any debt other than my mortgage and yes i do have a nest egg). My wife is currently a stay at home mom, and will be for another little while as we are planning kid #2 (she won the rock, paper scissors game) for this year.
