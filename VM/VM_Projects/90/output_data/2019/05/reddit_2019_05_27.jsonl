The French government owns 15% of Renault and most likely will not want to sell it, while the Italian government will never agree that the French government keep a large participation in the new possible firm. Right now the nationalism in Italy is quite high against France (for instance recently the problem with Nuova Castelli and Lactalis, or Fincantieri - STX, or even Essilor/Luxottica, or even the different italian firms that LVMH / Kering bought in the past years). \n\nMerger between equal is a nice word, but never exists. there is always one firm that prevail on the other. The best example is FCA itself, Fiat bought Chrysler and did a merger between equal, but right now all the cash comes from the Chrysler part, while fiat loses a lot of money, so in reality Chrysler became prevalant, even if the capital is controlled by the Agnelli. \n\nIn the current situation, a merger between equal between Renault and FCA is hard to believe. FCA is larger but Renault has way better margins and has a lot of cash in reserves (net position plus its participations in many JVs and Nissan obviously). \n-> It is way too political sensitive right now to happen in the short term.
