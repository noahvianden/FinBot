The upside is you don't have to hold a butt ton of reserve cash in holding the stock. The downside is you are at risk for every dollar above $250 TSLA may go. The possible loss is theoretically infinity, although we all know it's probably a few thousand. \n\nTo recap, trading naked options is 100% a WSB only strategy.
