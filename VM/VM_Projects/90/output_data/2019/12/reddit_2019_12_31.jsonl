A few points.\n\nI think you're right, if your feelings about autonomy are correct.  I don't think they are.\n\n> Cameras. These are a must. I'm not aware of anybody trying to develop AVs without cameras, and considering that our entire road transportation system is meant to be navigated with vision (traffic lights, traffic signs, etc.), I don't see how this could be possible.\n\n~~Tesla's cameras~~ (Edit: AP 2 only; yay) ~~are incapable of discerning flashing yellow lights, which are a common thing in some parts of the country.  https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/6icg6a/if_ap2_cameras_cant_detect_color_how_will_the/dj55zdu/~~\n\n> LIDAR. LIDAR is a little bit like radar in the sense that it detects the distance of objects. The difference are that LIDAR generally is used to detect objects in 360 degrees around the vehicle, is much more expensive, and does not work in bad weather conditions.\n\nWaymo's setup (including the custom-built car) is indeed on the order of $2-400k (edit: can't find my source on this one; it was a side-note in a larger article about something else).  If Tesla can get autonomy working without it, it will definitely be a cost advantage.  However, that's a big if, autonomy at $400k would still be profitable, and solving autonomy without lidar is harder.  It's also important to call out that when lidar works, it gives *much, **much** better* data.  If nothing else, that's extremely valuable to have, for training the cameras.\n\nThe third point I'll mention is that you're right that Tesla has *a lot* more data, but it's not entirely clear the value of that data.  Is billions of miles of data of humans (including myself; I love my M3 and use AutoSteer every day) driving better, or is millions of miles of fully driverless better?

Now, you could argue that Tesla gets some label data for free, from me, the driver, but I'd argue that it's unclear how valuable that is.\n\n> human drivers is the only way to encounter edge cases\n\nI don't think this is true.  You're conflating human drivers and \"real-world\" driving.\n\nMy guess is that you're talking about Waymo's billions of simulated miles.  If that's true, then I totally agree that those *are not intended to serve this purpose*.  They're an ML technique, not a data gathering technique.\n\nBut, like, that time a Waymo came upon [a woman in a wheel chair chasing a turkey with a broom](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/video/2017/mar/16/google-waymo-self-driving-car-video-woman-bird), while driving autonomously, is an example of an edge case found without a human driver.  Granted, in that case, there was a human in the driver seat.  But they didn't disengage because the Waymo handled it safely.\n\nAnd to take that a step further, collecting that data while in autonomous mode is much more valuable, because it verifies that there isn't an unknown unknown in the difference between how the car would have handled it, and how the human did.  Going further, not having a human in the driver's seat at all is even better, because then, e.g. there's no one to make eye contact with -- which could change how other cars and pedestrians respond (additional unknown unknowns).", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4371976852416992}, {"body": "Isn\u2019t your point about flashing yellow lights (AP2) very out of date?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That's a good point; I hope so, and I found someone saying AP2.5 can see yellow.\n\nhttps://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/ap-3-0-upgrade-from-ap-2-0-2-5.124534/page-2\n\n> I believe that AP 2.5 has color cameras.
