Heck the concept of a floating dollar untethered from gold is less than 50 years old. So all the questions you are posing don't have definitive answers yet and it may be centuries before we do. Given that disclaimer, here is one of the current theories for why economies grow: \n\nUsing GDP as the measure of an economy, we know economic growth is not entirely due to purely population, since otherwise population growth and GDP growth would be perfectly correlated. However, since GDP is meant to be a measure of everything that a nation produces, the more labor a economy has access to theoretically effects the amount of production output that nation can create. But that labor effectiveness also depends on how much capital (both human capital aka education and physical capital aka  money/machines/land/buildings) that the laborers have to work with. For example the computer or phone you are reading this on is physical capital and hopefully this thread is providing you human capital that you have access to that makes you more productive in the future compared to say an individual in a third world nation without access to a computer. \n\nTo put this in math terms GDP growth is commonly written as GDP = A * capital * working age population\n-Growth in capital is hard to measure but theoretically dependent on investments in either R&D and education\n-Growth in working age population is an important  caveat since an extra child or retiree won't grow economic production, aka GDP, just economic consumption. \nThe last variable A is a constant given to technological growth. This means innovation of all kinds, like computers, better drilling that allow for more oil to be gained per well, better managerial practices in banks. Things being made better through innovation is part of A. The only known for certain is that A is not constant between different nations or over time. Some economists think A was largest during the industrial revolution and is now logarithmically increasing until eventually our growth is back to almost 0 worldwide. On the other side of the spectrum done believe A increases exponentially and economic growth worldwide will continue to increase exponentially. That is why some on this thread on saying growth is slowing down and others are saying it only speeds up, just opinions of different economic theories with nothing definitive either way yet.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["gdp"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "This video does a really good job of explaining: http://youtu.be/PHe0bXAIuk0", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05438099429011345}, {"body": "Increasing productivity.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.46893277764320374}, {"body": "So toss away stuff you don't need in the end  \n  \nBut keep what's important and know who's your friend", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09262397885322571}, {"body": "If 50 MM people died overnight--A rapid deflationary crash would result due to a collapse in monetary velocity, which would result in the Fed printing money till trees became endangered, resulting in a hyperinflation.
