{"title": "Reiterating the $SPCE Short Thesis", "selftext": "Don't know why I feel compelled to do this, but here we are. Virgin Galactic ($SPCE) has mooned over the last couple days after receiving an extremely-optimistic upgrade from a Morgan Stanley analyst. \n\nIn short: SPCE is the worst of all of the tech IPOs I've seen this year, and that's saying a lot. Breaking it down:\n\n* **Fundamentals:** The company has *next-to-no revenue*. This ain't a \"not making much money yet\" situation, folks. It's a \"not making any money at all\" situation. The company had an annual revenue of $3 million this year, which is probably a fraction of what gets lost by our forum every week on OTM options. It burned $51 million in cash in Q3. The company [didn't even fucking do GAAP accounting](https://fortune.com/2019/07/09/virgin-galactic-merger-public-stock/) in its IPO lead-up. After the Morgan Stanley pump $SPCE is sitting at a market cap of $1.85 billion, **460x current sales**. Even with its own bullshit projections $SPCE would be hitting 7x EBIDTA in 2023. (This is above distressed levels.) *Really makes ya think.*\n* **Market:** The company prices one-and-a-half hour flights to space at $250k. The market for these is, suffice it to say, limited. This is the extreme end of luxury discretionary spending. That spending is fueled by folks who rely on passive income from their investments. It took the company fifteen years to book 600 reservations. What do you all think is going to happen to reservations when we hit a correction? Are these people gonna sell their mansion in the Hamptons or cancel that space flight?\n* **Tech Pipeline:** Technological development isn't a neat, straight line. You don't get from a buggy, half-proven technology to market dominance without hitting a thousand bumps along the way. It takes time, a lot of time. Even if things proceed smoothly, this company has no viable path to profitability within five to ten years. There's also the early adopter problem. BlackBerry was a successful smartphone company with massive market share and a good product. Where is it now? $SPCE isn't fucking BlackBerry, and it will face all the same problems with competition.\n* **Accidents:** The company has a [history of fatal accidents](https://www.space.com/30073-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-pilot-error.html). One fuck up now and you can kiss your reservations and share price goodbye.\n* **The Analyst:** Adam Jonas, the MS analyst hyping $SPCE, is the source of our pump. The man is famous for asking questions so speculative and stupid (\"[what about Tesla on Mars?](http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2019/05/23/1558607451000/The-best-of-Morgan-Stanley-s-Adam-Jonas/)\") that even Elon Musk rolled his eyes at him. The pitch for $SPCE is that it's going to disrupt airline travel with hyper-sonic technology. This is so fucking dumb it needs its own bullet point. Jonas is either really this dumb, or a useful shill to pump stocks that his firm is long on.\n* **Airlines and Hyper-sonic Travel:** The airline industry is a massive, highly-regulated industry. Anyone who knows the least bit about airline business models knows that Jonas' pitch is a fucking joke. The tech necessary to make hyper-sonic flight *commercially* viable doesn't exist. Have you guys ever heard of the [Concorde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concorde)? It was a plane that could get you from New York to London in under three hours, aimed at a luxury market, that started operating in *1969*. Spoiler alert: The airlines gave up on it because it lost so much fucking money.\n* **The Buyers:** The buyers right now are either dumb money who weren't paying close attention to the IPO launch or opportunistic institutions. Neither is going to hold this golden turd when it gets rattled by an accident, a closer look at its financials, or general risk-off sentiment in the markets. $SPCE is the ultimate BS growth stock - growth does not do well in corrections.\n* **The Bottom Line:** Short, short, a thousand times short. Price target $6 or lower within 2020, could crater completely with a fatal accident.\n\n**tl;dr: $SPCE is an utter, deep-fried turd of a tech stock, consider yourself warned if you're long on it.**", "id": "e8ugkb", "created_utc": 1576002275.0, "score": 51, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "I was up a steady 10% in one week of stock trading, and was going to transfer the money from this account to my options account at the end of the day.

Sure there will be more people if they ever do have regular space flights but this is an inelastic product, and people who want to use it are already exhausted IMO.  \n\n\nPlus costs are being under forecast and will rise significantly once flights do begin (If they ever do).
