Most analysts still concerned because Model S/X's were down about 10k vs highly profitable Q3 2018's, while Model 3's were up almost 20k. Still, it's much, much better than last Qtr and should have a higher mix of Model 3 versions than when Q1 was ramping up low end model sales after only delivering mid-high end models before that.  Regardless, total sales were the best ever and operations were stabilizing, and cost reductions were in place across the board so I feel quite good about them beating estimates, and likely turning a nice profit.  Also, the release says \"we made significant progress streamlining our global logistics and delivery operations at higher volumes, enabling cost efficiencies and improvements to our working capital position\".\n\n3) I think suppliers got scared shitless as a negative bias and deep concern developed about TSLA's profitability.
