I would assume that it meant stockholders would be entitled to a percentage of the company's profits relative to the volume of stocks they own in the company, paid out in dividends. For instance, owning 500 out of the 1000 total stock volume in a company gets you 50% of the profit.\n\nHowever, some companies (e.g Amazon), do not pay dividends.

While Ford pays a 6.27% dividend, their stock price has gone down \\~5% compared to where they were a year ago.

Reinvest the cash in the business\n2. Pay dividends to shareholders\n2. Buy back shares\n4. Keep the cash\n\n**Reinvesting in the business** - If a business has internal projects that will generaet high returns (like rolling out additional stores, or spending more on customer acquisition, or building more factories, or setting up new divisions) then shareholders are better off if they do this, as the shareholder is unlikely to get the same return on their money if they were given the cash to reinvest it themselves. This is why many young high growth companies pay no dividends whereas more mature companies do, they have different opportunities to profitably reinvest.\n\n**Dividends** - If there aren't high return opportunities for reinvestment, then companies can return cash to shareholders. Some choose to do this by paying a dividend, which in most countries will be taxed in the hands of the investor. Where this happens tax has been paid by the company on profits, and by the investor on the dividend, so it's effectively a form of double taxation.\n\n**Buybacks** - Some businesses choose to buy back shares instead of (or in addition to) paying dividends. While remaining investors don't see any cash from this, the reduction in the share count means that remaining investors will own a proportionally higher amount of the company going forward. They don't pay tax on this benefit, which is why buybacks are often seen as a more tax-effective way of returning capital to shareholders over dividends.\n\n**Keeping the cash** - Companies keep cash for various reasons. Sometimes it's because they operate in volatile industries so need cash in case things turn down. Sometimes they want to have cash around in case attractive M&A opportunities arise. Sometimes they keep it as a defensive measure to deter fierce competition. Sometimes they do it just because they're used to it and aren't pressured enough to return it.\n\nPersonally I think many large tech companies keep too much cash and it's value-destructive to do so.

If lots of cash starts accumulating on a company's balance sheet, investors may start to wonder whether the company's management (i.e. the CEO) is using its cash in a way that increases the value of the company, and in turn, generates the best returns for investors.\n\nThe four primary ways a company can use cash to generate returns are to 1) invest in R&D, marketing, or other organic growth opportunities, 2) buy a company, 3) buy back shares, or 4) give the money straight back to investors in the form of a dividend.

Once a company issues a dividend, there is an expectation that the company will continue to issue dividends forever.

If the company ever decides to stop issuing dividends, the market reacts negatively, and the share price drops pretty significantly (plenty of research on this out there, but I'm on my phone now, so I won't link).  No CEO wants to be the one to make the share price drop by cutting the dividend, so the company has to be very confident that their business is stable and that they can afford to pay dividends for many, many years.

That\u2019s exactly how much current value you\u2019re buying. But this particular savings account happens to earn 5% interest annually. So a year from now it will have $105 in it and you will still own 1/10th, which means your portion is now worth $10.50.\n\nThat is why stocks (as a whole) consistently go up in value over long periods of time.

All of the money stays in the account (aka no dividend is paid). In year two, the account goes up by 5% again and is now worth $110.25. Your portion is now worth $11.03. In year 3 it goes up another 5% and your portion is worth $11.58.\n\nSituation 2: Full Dividend\nAfter one year the savings account is worth $105. They pay out all of their profits as a dividend. You now own $10 of the account and have $0.50 in cash ($10.50 total). Now the account has $100 in it. In year two, it goes up by 5% again and is now worth $105. It pays all profits as a dividend and you now have $10 of ownership and $1 in cash ($11.00 total). In year three, the savings account starts with $100 and goes up by 5% again. It pays out all profits as dividends and you now have $10 in ownership and $1.50 in cash ($11.50 total). \n\nIn situation one (where they don\u2019t pay a dividend) you actually end up with more money because of compound interest.

High risk for the early investors, lower risk for the company, early on. Later in the growth cycle, if it survives that long, it may finance operations and growth from cash flow/earnings, issue debt or issue more shares. \n\n\\- Conceptually, equity is a claim to the earnings and cash flow of a company. While it's true some shares do not pay dividends and may elect to 'retain earnings, there is still inherent value to those earnings, whether they are paid out in dividends, stock buybacks, acquisitions, internal debt pay down, or simply retained. Some business retain earnings because of the capital intensity of their business and MUST reinvest in their business just to stay competitive (munger hates these kinds of businesses) and other's do so because it's the BEST form of reinvestment, rather than paying out a dividend or buying back shares. \n\nSomething oft missed is that with the US Federal Reserve targeting a 2% inflation rate through any means necessary, long-term stocks will likely meet that pace or exceed it. In the short-run, companies often lack pricing power. In the long-term though, companies will inevitably raise prices and there is a bit of arbitrage between public and private markets, such that if the Equity of a company to buy out completely than purchasing raw materials or inputs, then companies would look to acquire publicly traded entities, rather than buy raw materials. This was instilled in me through various Buffett, Munger and other books, in that, this is what they often just keep investing in equities over decades, because if stocks seem too cheap on a valuation basis, companies will simply buy shares and acquire what's needed, rather than buy raw materials or inputs direct and/or privately. \n\nIt's also worth noting that with expenses and trading costs approaching near zero, liquidity flows more freely from cash, to stocks, to funds, to bonds, than at any point in history. Today's choice of holding equities isn't simply about long-term returns, but also short-term rates of return and liquidity. If liquidity is high, which it is today, then stocks will continue to rise and to not be invested, at least partially means everything around you becomes more expensive. If liquidity is low (dries up), stocks will fall, both because there's a lack of money in the short-run to buy stocks, but also because consumers lack funds for consumption, and 70% of the economy are consumers and direct spending.\n\nSimplistically, stocks rises based on (earnings growth rate + dividend yield + p/e expansion or contraction) = long-term expected growth for stocks. John Bogle conceptualized this basic model, suggesting average stock returns to be based upon earnings growth rate, plus the starting dividend yield, plus the price expansion or contraction factored in. If the market was at a p/e of 15 and goes to 18, he'd add a 2% bumper to the yield and earnings growth, because people are willing to 'pay' up for stocks and earnings. This was how we had years like the 80's and 90's, because all economic factors were positive and investors paid up for earnings as time went by. \n\nConversely, the 2000's until around 2013, saw a major contraction across the board, as investors were not willing to pay up, earnings collapsed several times and dividend yields meandered about. In fact, the most basic return for about 13 years was purely based on a globally diversified portfolio and yield, be it Real Estate, Equities, or Bonds. 2000-2013 did not provide much in the way of capital appreciation (earnings growth) or expansion in the p/e multiple.
