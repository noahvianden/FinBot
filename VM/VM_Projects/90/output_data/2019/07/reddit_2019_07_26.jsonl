He mentions the following factors:\n\n- capital expenditures (capex),\n- research and development (R&D),\n- interest expenses\n\nThere's also four other, \"rapid growth\" related factors that are systematically decreasing and distorting Tesla's GAAP income:\n\n- **Depreciation and amortization:** In Q2'19 there was a D&A GAAP expense of $578m - a significant part of which is the gradual, scheduled depreciation of past expansion capex. But because Tesla is growing so fast, this past expense doesn't reflect the actual 'steady state true depreciation' of various assets - which is estimated to be in the $100m range. We'll need the 10-Q to estimate the actual depreciation/amortization rate more accurately. I.e. this expense is elevated and not representative of the depreciation expenses of 'steady state' production facilities where equipment is maintained and replaced.\n- **Stock compensation:** as a Silicon Valley company Tesla is awarding all their employees stock options and other types of equity compensation. This is happening at a rate of a couple of percentage points per year and does not cost any cash to do - and this was a GAAP expense of -$210m in Q2'19 alone.\n- **Growth inefficiencies:** most growing companies are historically inefficient, especially when growing as fast as Tesla. It's not possible to estimate this with any accuracy, but it took Amazon years as well to improve their historically expensive delivery system into one of the most efficient ones on the market. To put a speculative number to it: a cost effect of 5-10% of revenue would not be surprising to me.\n- **Economies of scale:** suppliers tend to offer discounts based on volume, and with Tesla growing their cost structure will improve accordingly as well. Tesla is making cars at an annualized rate of ~350k units and cannot hope to get the kind of volume deals from suppliers that the biggest carmakers that are delivering millions of units can get. As Tesla is growing they'll be able to take advantage of more and more economies of scale.\n\nIf we examine the cash flow space, which is not affected by GAAP expenses, [then Tesla's business was wildly profitable for the last 12 months even at current production volumes and efficiency levels](https://old.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/ci0ie2/why_wasnt_tesla_profitable_072519_tesla_daily/ev0hf3p/), generating almost three billion dollars of cash.", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "I love this way of doing accounting: \n\"whatever does not fit my narrative I take it off.\"\n\nNumbers most of the time do not lie (well US GAAP are not really good compared to IFRS but still are okayish). \nBut if you do not report a profit, you simply do not report a profit. Is it a problem ? Obviously not. A profit is a profit, and a loss is a loss. \n\nIn my language there is a saying which would be translated to smth like: \"with ifs, we can reshape the world\". \n\nSo yeah sure, if you do not take into account D&A, One-offs, restructuration costs, stock compensation and whatnot, Tesla can run a profit, but guess what? Then almost any companies can run a profit then, but it is a fictuous profit, not a real one. \n\nThe use of financial accouting, is to allow investors and all stakeholders (not shareholders), to know about the health of a company, and to do that you need to have level the playng field and put everyone on an equal footing. \n\nBy this equal footing (and even there, US GAAP allows for leeway, as seen by R&D expenses for instance), Tesla posted a loss and that's all. IT IS NOT A BIG DEAL, but stop trying to always pinkview a situation, because this is not how Tesla will improve. \n\nYour only somewhat valid point is the economies of scale, but that is the principle itself of business and to reach a critical mass, that is one of the challenge of Tesla, so quite self explanatory. \n\nBut honesly your point on D&A is quite ludicrous, considering that Tesla already has a REALLY aggresiv way of reporting D&A compare to many auto makers.", "score": 26, "replies": [{"body": "> A profit is a profit, and a loss is a loss. \n\nActually, that's not even *remotely* true of \"GAAP income\": due to non-cash items that imperfectly estimate true expenses, plus the long term shareholder value that Tesla is constructing.\n\nNote that my arguments aren't limited to Tesla: the GAAP income of most other high growth high-tech companies is not reflective of the profitability of their underlying business - the best known example is Amazon, [who had much lower GAAP income than cash generated](http://i.imgur.com/Y9SvlV7.png), before the Wall Street bears hyperventilating about growth investments capitulated and the company reached a ~trillion dollars of valuation.\n\nAlso note that I'm not disputing the reported Tesla financials at all: they are actually impressive ***despite*** the GAAP distortions. I'm also pointing out that **the profitability of the underlying business of Tesla** is not the same as Tesla's reported numbers, due to the factors mentioned in the podcast, and due to the above factors as well.\n\nSince the long term corporate value of Tesla is the sum of all future cash flows, concentrating on the intrinsic profitability of their various business segments is a key task investors should perform IMO, beyond the short term GAAP numbers which are important too in their own context.\n\nAlso, you didn't actually counter any of my points beyond vague generics, the only somewhat specific complaint you mention is:\n\n> But honesly your point on D&A is quite ludicrous, considering that Tesla already has a REALLY aggresiv way of reporting D&A compare to many auto makers.\n\nExactly in what way do you consider Tesla's D&A reporting \"aggressive\"?
