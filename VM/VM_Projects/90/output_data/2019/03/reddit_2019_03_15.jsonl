Everyone was promising a lot,\u201d said Heiko Kraft, director of analysis and testing for Mercedes-Benz self-driving car research in Sunnyvale, Calif.\n\nNow, however, companies are more cautious about setting timelines because, among other issues, self-driving cars have had a hard time interpreting and responding to unique scenarios, Mr. Kraft said. As an example, he pointed to a problem his company faced recently when a car it was testing was confused by a school crossing guard riding a bicycle with a stop sign poking out of a backpack.\n\nThe hurdles that still face the most ambitious players were vividly illustrated during a demonstration ride in a self-driving car from Aptiv, a provider of hardware to the industry that has been running autonomous vehicle tests in Las Vegas for more than a year. On the ride with The Information, the car\u2019s safety driver had to take control to guide the vehicle around a construction zone. The driver also has to take the wheel to pick up passengers in private hotel lots, according to a person who used the system in a live scenario.\n\nhttps://www.citylab.com/transportation/2019/01/self-driving-car-technology-consumer-electronics-show/580027/\n\nhttps://outline.com/JKgg6R\n\n\"'Reality is kicking in': Ford says self-driving vehicles are further away than many expect\"\n\nhttps://www.stuff.co.nz/motoring/109805157/the-selfdriving-car-industry-just-acknowledged-it-has-an-image-problem\n\nhttps://twitter.com/amir/status/1075633551268179968?s=21\n\n(notice this Cruise car can't handle a VERY simple task of moving around a parked delivery vehicle. something a developmentally disabled 15 year old could figure out).\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/01/toyota-is-betting-fully-driverless-cars-are-still-years-away/\n\n\"None of us in the automobile or IT industries [is] close\" to solving the challenge of fully autonomous vehicles, said Gill Pratt, CEO of the Toyota Research Institute, in a speech at the Consumer Electronics Show on Monday.\n\nhttps://www.knoxnews.com/story/money/business/2019/01/01/olli-knoxville-self-driving-autonomous-vehcile/2292584002/\n\nhttp://www.thedrive.com/tech/25589/the-10-worst-self-driving-stories-of-2018\n\nhttps://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/12/we-finally-talked-to-an-actual-waymo-passenger-heres-what-he-told-us/\n\nhttps://www.autonews.com/regulation-safety/key-us-senator-calls-self-driving-legislation-long-shot\n\nhttps://www.thestreet.com/opinion/driverless-cars-will-be-the-biggest-investment-write-off-ever-14818507\n\nhttps://gizmodo.com/the-deadly-recklessness-of-the-self-driving-car-industr-1831027948\n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/tusimple-self-driving-truck-cameras-computer-vision/\n\nThe demo drive also, however, makes clear there\u2019s work to be done. After 40 minutes of, uneventful robo-driving, a computer voice interrupts our conversation: \u201cAutonomous driving off.\u201d Without my noticing it, the safety driver has retaken control. \u201cI\u2019ve got a freeze on my visual,\u201d he tells Hou. \u201cI shut it down for safety.\u201d A network card in that server box next to me disconnected, likely due to the truck's vibration, freezing the system's human-machine interface and blocking the bit that does the motion planning from the bit that executes its commands.\n\nAnd so this flesh-and-bones human holds the wheel and works the pedals for the next 20 minutes, taking us off the highway and back to TuSimple\u2019s garage. The computer crash mars what started off as a very impressive ride, but hey, there are worse kinds of crashes.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/binarybits/status/1071098533862871040?s=21\n\n\"Until recently my mental model of Waymo was that their technology was basically ready to go in late 2017 and they were doing a last few months of testing out of an abundance of caution, and to give time to build out non-technical stuff like customer service and maintenance.\n\nThis week has forced me to totally re-evaluate that. It now looks to me like Waymo is nowhere close to ready for fully driverless operation in its initial <100 square mile service area, to say nothing of the rest of the Phoenix metro or other cities.\n\nThe Arizona Republic's @utilityreporter spent three days following Waymo cars around and wrote a great piece about it. One of the most striking facts: \"we never observed a vehicle shuttling passengers.\" - https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/tech/2018/12/05/phoenix-waymo-vans-how-self-driving-cars-operate-roads/2082664002/\n\nIf Waymo were confident in its technology and almost ready for a large-scale launch, you would expect them to be doing a lot of test rides with real passengers to test out the whole system\u2014customer service, capacity management, vehicle cleaning, etc.\n\nBut clearly Waymo is far from that point. This is a company that's still trying to get its technology to work, not a company doing a dress rehearsal for an imminent large-scale launch.\n\nAnd if Waymo isn't close to ready for a real commercial launch, then a lot of what they've done over the last 18 months\u2014signing deals with Avis, hiring a bunch of customer service reps, ordering 82,000 cars, etc\u2014seems premature.\n\nI saw that stuff as evidence that the technology was on track, because I thought Waymo, of all companies, would avoid the trap of getting overconfident about a complex software project. I guess not.\n\nThis means I have no idea how long it will take for Waymo (or anyone else) to reach full autonomy. It could take six months or it could take six years. Maybe Waymo will be forced to throw out big chunks of what they've built so far and start over.\n\nBTW, @amir deserves special recognition for his thorough, independent, and skeptical reporting on Waymo over the last few months. He's been totally vindicated this week. https://www.theinformation.com/articles/waymos-big-ambitions-slowed-by-tech-trouble \u2026\"\n\nhttps://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/tech/2018/12/05/phoenix-waymo-vans-how-self-driving-cars-operate-roads/2082664002/\n\nhttps://www.axios.com/who-will-pay-for-autonomous-vehicles-11702624-0fbf-4b5f-9d3a-bf5c4cd3ed8a.html\n\nhttps://www.theinformation.com/articles/waymos-big-ambitions-slowed-by-tech-trouble?shared=4596b7125469ea51", "score": 35, "replies": [{"body": "I read what you wrote but didn't click the links.
