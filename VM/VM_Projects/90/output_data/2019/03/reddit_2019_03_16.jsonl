Repeat a few times, if there is high noise. Carefully observe how the results deviate from expectations. Look for patterns.\n5. If advice fails to pan out, discard it. What's left is knowledge and real experience.\n\nWhen buying a stock, you want to be informed enough to make a the best choice. There are finite companies.  Your goal is to find the ones that offer the best reward:risk ratio. Less risk, more reward.\n\nLook for risks that eliminate candidates quickly. Avoid industries that you don't understand at all. Say, the technology is too complex, or their customers needs are incomprehensible, or you can't see how they could grow, or you can't describe what their risk profile even is.\n\nOn the reward side, look for companies whose customers and products you do understand, and whose prospects are likely to grow, in your opinion. Ideally, inform your opinion. Companies succeed because:\n\n \\- they can grow (by selling to more people, or by selling more products/services to the same people)\n\n \\- they have loyal customers\n\n \\- they have talented employees who can (more than the average) invent new or improved products\n\n \\- they have talented managers and leaders who have a track record of finding and capitalizing on opportunities\n\n \\- they have few competitors, or they have good moats (barriers to competition)\n\n \\- they have a monopoly, but not at risk of being taken to court for anti-competitive practises\n\nYou want to understand how they make money, why their product is valuable, and how they can increase their market size and/or share, and/or decrease their costs through innovation.\n\nInnovation is a tricky thing.

Investopedia has a lot of resources on this. Learn how to draw trend lines, read candlestick patterns, some price structure patterns, and compare volume to price momentum. Also I'd recommend starting with longer timeframes like the Monthly and Weekly charts as the trendlines tend to be stronger and easier to define.\n\nAlso, something which even intermediate investors/traders struggle with is wanting to make quick easy money. Most people get excited about fast movers (that have already made big moves), and they assume they will continue to do so. Usually if something has gone up or down a lot recently, it will then usually spend more time retracing (doing the exact opposite). In other words novices tend to be attracted to flashy charts/companies that have recently seen media hype (are likely at the end of big moves), and they end up buying the top. A lot of being a good trader/investor, is being willing to hold your own views especially when they are contrary to the general public. I'd much rather buy something that is sideways just starting to reverse trend on longer time frames and no one is talking about, then the next weed company that just got bought by Marlborough, was featured in the news, and already saw 200% gains over the past year.\n\nLastly, be prepared to lose. When you first get started you will probably lose money a lot. You will likely buy the tops, and sell the bottoms. Speculation takes many hours of practice, refining your technique, figuring out your strengths, trying new strategies, learning as much as you can through education and experience. Most traders lose money for the first 2 years.
