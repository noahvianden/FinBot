Bitching won't change that.  \n\nThey need to make a better effort to counterbalance that with positive marketing, but maybe more importantly they need to really pay better attention to branding strategy.

Shutting down most stores with no warning  a couple weeks after planning massive retail expansion and with retail formerly at the centerpiece of both your sales strategy and your Apple inspired branding?
