This is a similar situation to timing a top or a bottom, it's easy only looking back. I can draw a hundred perfectly valid potential resistance levels, which one of those would make the price bounce next time is still everyone's guess. Every 5 cents you can find some resistance if you look for it. \n\n- If assume that the resistance levels are there, and the more times the price bounces off them the stronger they become (that's the belief), then as the time passes prices should converge to these resistance levels and rarely move away, since the probability of breaking through the resistance level would be getting smaller and smaller with each bounce. In reality it rarely bounces more than couple times (just enough to \"spot\" it). If you think about it, any change of a direction within a historical price range would look like a bounce on a graph, so 2 times bounce really is a 0 times bounce - a random price change within a range. \n\n- Resistance levels imply that the past prices affects the future movement. From the studies I've seen, the chances of a stock having a green day after 5 consecutive green days is still 50%, so no resistance from the past seems to affect it (just like with a coin flip).\n\n- Regarding self fulfilling prophecy. This implies that the stock price is indeed random, but a large group of people believes they have an edge. The winning strategy here then would be to actually take the opposite side of the bet to take an advantage of them.

If the markets were truly random people would not be winning with short-term trading strategies\n\nThe entire premise of the book and his research was to refute that belief. The fact that some people are successful using TA doesn't prove that TA is correct. If TA had strong predictive power, then most of the people who used TA would be successful, not a small number of them. The nature of random distributions is that some people will lose big, some people will win big, and most people will fall somewhere in the middle.\n\nConsider a trading \"system\" where, before market open, you made a list of the 20 most traded stocks of the previous day, rolled a twenty sided die to select one of the stocks, then flipped a coin to determine whether or not you should buy ATM puts or calls on that stock for that day. If you had a hundred thousand people do this, statistically speaking, some of them would become huge winners. But that doesn't prove that the system I've created has any power whatsoever.\n\nEdit: I noticed elsewhere in the thread you said:\n\n> The problem is you guys simply can't grasp the fact that technical analysis is NOT a predictive tool. It is a risk management tool.\n\nIf you're using TA for managing entry and exit points, I have no problem with that (even though Mandelbrot still disagreed and stated it's not a foundation on which to build a global risk management system).

Prior to Mandelbrot's research, black swan events were not correctly modeled in risk management, and his research gave the industry a better understanding of what types of adverse events can occur in regular markets.

You invest in Apple because you bought and love their new phone, not because of their past performance, chart indicators, their cultural esteem, etc. In my opinion, this direct experiential information is the best information you can have, because that company is directly creating value in your life (the likely implication being that they are creating value in a lot of other people's lives too, and that they are doing something right and growing).

TA believers generally believe they have a statistical edge after certain patterns or trading setups appear -- not that they can accurately tell the difference between random charts and non-random charts in a small sample size.\n\nIf hypothetically we lived in a world where a particular technical setup was profitable (let's say it wins 55% of the time with a 1:1 risk reward ratio), I believe that people would still fail this test. Without a large sample size, it would be nearly impossible to determine the difference.\n\nOf course, we can statistically test a lot of technical strategies, and most of them don't produce any edge. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it doesn't exist -- just that we haven't heard of them (in fact, most strategies that do work will not be publicized and the ones that do become well known will generally lose their alpha).
