If the car stays running, the seller gets the premium the buyer paid for the insurance. If the car gets totaled, the seller has to pay the agreed upon amount to cover it, and get stuck with the wreckage.\n\n\nA little more detailed breakdown:\nBuying a call you are **paying** money upfront expecting the price of the underlying to increase, wanting to profit either from buying the shares and selling them at higher than the strike price + whatever premium you paid, or selling the option for more money than you paid to purchase it. \n\nSelling a put you are **paid** money upfront expecting/wanting the price to increase so you don't* get assigned the shares. When you set a strike price for when you sell a put, you are obligated to purchase the shares at that strike price. Obviously, no one will sell you shares for $20 if they are trading on the market for $25, so the risk of selling puts is that you will get assigned and forced to pay $20 per share for something that may be trading well below that. \n\n*Some people sell puts wanting to get assigned the shares. It's a way to set a price that you are willing to pay for the shares. For example ABC is trading for $50, but you would rather pay $40, so you would sell a put option, get paid the premium, and if the stock were to fall to $40 or below and you get assigned. In this particular case, it's a win-win, you got 100 shares at a price that you were comfortable with, and you keep the upfront premium. The downside is you are obligated to pay $40 per share, even if ABC fell all the way to 0. Another downside is, to be on the safe side, you want to make sure you have the capital to purchase the shares during the duration of the option contract, tying up that capital that could potentially be used to make money elsewhere.\n", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0096318693831563}, {"body": "Because it's less capital intensive in a margin account.

{"title": "Can we talk about YETI?", "selftext": "Lots of buzz about this stock, but the hype honestly seems crazy irrational.\n\nA few posts have mentioned the fact that the short interest is very high on this stock...\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/avrbn4/very\\_high\\_yeti\\_short\\_interest/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/avrbn4/very_high_yeti_short_interest/)\n\n...yet it keeps climbing.\n\nI'd like to call attention to the fact that of the 84M shares outstanding:\n\n* About 42M are owned by  Cortec Group Fund V, L.P. and are not for trade.\n* 16M shares are owned by the founding brothers\n* 8M are locked behind employee stock programs ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1670592/000110465918063819/0001104659-18-063819-index.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1670592/000110465918063819/0001104659-18-063819-index.htm))\n\nSo that leaves us with 18M shares left, and public info shows that there's a float of 15M, so it's in line. So if you're a Chad that wants a piece of the YETI action, you're competing with every other overlanding-bros for a piece of that 15M float pie. (Meanwhile the short interest on the float is now 68%).\n\nSo my take on it is that Cortec and the brothers will hold onto their controlling power of the company, 8M shares that are currently locked behind employee incentive contracts (just think, there's employee based locked in compensation equal to 50% of the float right now!!!!) will be released to the masses and that supply will drive the price down.\n\nMeanwhile lets look at financials:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* This turd is trading at 38x P/E.\n   * A little context, AAPL is trading at 15x.\n* In their filing ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1670592/000104746918006818/a2236927zs-1a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1670592/000104746918006818/a2236927zs-1a.htm)) they funded an increase in cash with a reduction in inventory, which is good. Inventory control is doing well. But there hasn't been any substantial change to their asset base in the same time. Net sideways.\n* Their liabilities decreased 25M, but that just takes the owners equitiy from being negative to slightly less negative.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just don't get it. Can someone help me understand this piece of shit stock?\n\nFull disclosure, I have short positions on the stock and I'm getting murdered right now.\n\nEDIT: maths problem in financials\n\nEDIT 2:\n\nTo clarify, even in their own disclosure ([https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1670592/000104746918006465/a2236767zs-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1670592/000104746918006465/a2236767zs-1.htm)) they state the following.
