They've been able to bounce back on any minor setback. Housing prices tumble 40% in Toronto, but their GDP and banks keep growing. Unemployment rate shoots up, but 50k jobs created next month. A quarter of negative GDP growth, but then reversed next quarter. Hence, no recession since 2008 while Canadians keep on taking on more debt.\n\nBut I think it's time.\n\nTheir banks are starting to put aside heavy loan loss provisions. Here, I put down the biggest banks in Canada and their loan loss provisions increase.\n\nTD - 22.7%\n\nRBC - 54%\n\nBMO - (3%)\n\nBNS - 26%\n\nCIBC - 120%\n\nI'll add more once I have time. I want to emphasis, that this COULD be it. COULD be. These things take a while to play out, and some financial panic might not happen until Q4 of this year.

Im guessing this is people who earns their money in China, but their immediate family lives and studies in Canada. Furthermore, classifying a household as purchased by non-resident when only one is non-resident is exactly the situation that most new chinese immigrants find themselves in, (one of father or mother works in canada, children and spouse lives and studies in canada). So in this situation, this isnt \"the chinese\" driving up the housing price (well it is but are if we start separating the \"pure immigrants\" from the \"dirty ones\" thats just going down anther rabbit hole). In this situation the restriction on capital outflow is different, every new immigrant is entitled to the assets they declared when applying for immigration into canada, tax-free, and this situation the outflow restrictions arent as strict. So new-immigrants sell their old apartment in China for a cool $2-3million CAD and swap their dirty run-down condo for a brand-new 6000sq/ft house with clear skies above and free healthcare (compounded by the easy loaning for new-immigrants back then). The tax sharing part thus doesn't apply to these individuals since their income was clean and any tax is already paid for in China. Wang was doing something else, he was taking loans from the national banks and buying assets abroad which was seen as a sign of hedging against China'a declining economy (big political no no, no matter how smart the business decision was) thats why he got fucked, but he has since sold those assets to more powerful members who can hedge w/o repercussions.
