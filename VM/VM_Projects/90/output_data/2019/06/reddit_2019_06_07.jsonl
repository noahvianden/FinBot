Google says it will eventually allow people to play games directly over WiFi from any TV with Chromecast, computer with a Chrome browser, and Google Pixel phones. There are no downloads as the games themselves exist on Google cloud servers. That means Stadia can also sync game progress across devices.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Google is only releasing a limited version of the system in November, however. Stadia will work on TVs with a Chromecast dongle or Chromecast support at launch. Those on computers or mobile devices are out of luck until 2020.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Stadia will launch in 14 countries in November, including the **United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Sweden, France, and Italy**. Google plans to expand it to more countries next year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Next year, Google will release a regular streaming subscription called Stadia Pro, which **will cost $9.99 a month** and include access to 31 games and counting, including Destiny 2, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Borderlands 3, and Rage 2.", "id": "bxsluy", "created_utc": 1559900374.0, "score": 149, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "Can't wait until Google kills this after 2 years of half-baked support.", "score": 145, "replies": [{"body": "Sunset - that\u2019s the PR term.
