I expect WoW classic to bring a ton of subs back to the current game, and maybe even turn into something like Old School Runescape if they start making new content for the old game-systems. Plus if they announce a free character boost to 60 with a classic purchase(something they already do for the current interation), I could see a TON of people buying in. Something is brewing here. Probably going to hold this for the next year or so.\n* HEAR - Another company Reddit hates on, but they are a leader in the console headset space, that just expanded into PC peripherals via their acquisition of Roccat. They managed to clean up their finances considerably during the Fortnite boom, and I think they are poised to go up a lot over time. Another company I am looking to hold for about a year or so.\n* SE - Not really so much an E3 play, but more an e-sports play. I think anything tied to esports will get action during the conference and Sea Limited(aka Garena) is pretty much THE Esports play in South East Asia on the NYSE. Plus I think this company is going to do big things in general with Shopee and Airpay. I can't help but shake the feeling that this company might moon. Extra Extra long here.\n* NTDOY - While the switch is starting to enter the middle of its life-cycle, I think Nintendo is finally starting to get their act together from an on-line services standpoint. I expect them to push this hard at E3, and the stock to go up as a result. That all being said I will probably sell this shortly after E3 because their stock is volatile as fuck and will probably correct down afterwards.\n* NERD - I was the dude that made the NERD post currently sitting on the front page, and I see them as a super short term stock play. I think most of the companies in that ETF will do well during E3, but likely drop afterwards. Planning on Selling Thursday or Friday. I might re-enter if there is a correction down and the companies in the ETF made positive moves during E3.\n* (Honorable Mention) TTWO - I already sold my TTWO shares during the pre-E3 run up, but I think they will do well also. I am just trying to be disciplined here and not FOMO back in. I sold them because I thought the run-up was overdone and I expected a correction.
