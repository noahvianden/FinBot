{"title": "My thoughts on BYND post yesterday's fall", "selftext": "Upfront disclaimer: I'm long BYND. Now on yesterday's crash and why I'm still long / didn't sell: \n\n* TLRY had multiple >10% one-day crashes before it peaked at over $200 on 19-Sept. Then it halved over the next few trading days but then shot up 65%. Reason I make this analogy is because I also view BYND as TLYR 2.0 with the added benefit that it's the only pure-play on a very hot new theme (fake meat) vs. TLRY when it was one of many stocks in a very hot new theme (marijuana).\n* BYND also has the added benefit of free publicity from celebrities & influencers (who have a vested interest to promote because they're owners too) + from the vegan community especially considering that founder Ethan Brown is vegan and their products are GMO and soy free (unlike Impossible Foods).\n* I also don't think the short squeeze has happened yet because short interest remained at the \\~50% level during the 2 days where it popped (Fri and Mon). Why? One explanation is that if you take a granular look at the short interest data, most of the shorts were done at the $70-80 level. So perhaps they're waiting to get closer to this level to break-even / reduce their loss before realising it. But that's ANOTHER \\~40% fall on top of yesterday's fall just to break-even yet alone recoup the crazy amount they've been paying in borrow fees + make any profit.\n* But we're not going to get to that $70-80 level. Why? Here are the broker price targets in descending order: $126 (Bernstein) / $125 (CS) / $121 (JPM) / $105 (Jefferies) / $101 (BAML) / $91 (Consumer Edge - have no idea who they are) / $76 (GS). If BYND hits $100, then you have 3 analysts with >20% upside who'll upgrade it. If BYND fell 25% yesterday because of one analyst downgrade, how do you think it'll react to if 3 analysts upgraded?\n* Summary from all this: most of those who shorted will never make a profit. Eventually they'll have to throw in the towel because of how much they're bleeding on a daily basis in borrow fees.\n* In the meantime, I think there's huge scope for positive news-flow over the next 1-2 months that can cause a pop in the stock price. Announcing additional trials with QSRs (quick-service restaurants), existing trials going into full partnerships (e.g. Tim Hortons - this got announced this morning) and once again mgmt's conservative 140% YoY increase in 2019 revenue only includes post-trial partnerships (i.e. Tim Hortons is now additional upside), entering new markets (e.g. Asia which on the conference call mgmt said they want to aggressively enter), expanding their footprint in Europe (where rival Impossible Food is struggling to access because of their GMO product which the EU is very anal about), and so on. And of course, the mother of all announcements: a trial with McDonalds. I still expect this to happen in the near-term.\n* Summary: I still think the stock has room to run over the next few months. I'm personally waiting for the above catalysts to happen (new QSR trials, McDonalds announcement, short-squeeze) before thinking of trimming / exiting. I plan to exit starting in October either way because at the end of October is when the IPO 180-day lock-up ends (lots of insider selling from VCs and other early investors who want to monetise their investment + additional supply of shares makes it easier to short).\n* Disclaimer: this is just my thinking of how things can play out and I can be completely wrong.

When the nuances of each particular case are weighed out, I believe the \"right\" action is that which leads to the best consequences among all available actions. Wherein the \"best consequences\" are those which account for the well-being of ALL affected by the action, according to the effect it has upon them.\n\nMy views on veganism(and everything else) are no different. Dogmatic refusal to consider ethics on a case-by-case basis is a recipe for immoral outcomes.\n\nI believe, generally speaking, that it is immoral to take the life of a bear, for example, who doesn't want to die. However, I imagine it won't take much convincing for you to agree there can exist a scenario in which taking a bear's life may be the option which leads to best moral outcome.\n\nSay a rabid grizzly bear has charged into a daycare center and the only way to ensure the safety of the children is to shoot him dead. In this case, I believe it is morally justifiable to kill the bear, because it is the option which maximizes well-being. \n\nTo clarify, my concern is not simply with the prevention of \"undue\" suffering. I'm not sure by what metric exactly we determine whether suffering is \"due\". The reason the action is morally justifiable on my view is because the balance of well-being is weighted heavily in favor of killing the bear and saving all the children. My concern is with the reduction of suffering of any and all kinds, regardless of whether it's \"undue\". Let's say the bear was made rabid through no fault of his own, and the daycare was recently built over it's habitat. Moreover, the bear doesn't have the reasoning skills necessary for moral agency to begin with, so in no way I can readily see, is this bear \"due\" any suffering. I nonetheless find it morally justifiable to cause this suffering, as it creates the least amount of suffering among all available options.\n\nThe same can be said for a human being in a sufficiently morally comparable situation. I don't subscribe to a deontological prohibition of \"rights violation\" in the case of the bear, nor do I with the human. I in no way deny the personhood of the adult in question, nor do I believe \"personhood\", \"humanity\", \"life\", or any other quality grants anyone unalienable \"rights\".(I can however see the value in operating as if they do, considering the limitations of human capacity for reason)\n\nI believe there are cases in which killing a human being, and thus violating their \"right to life\", may in fact be the most moral action. By which I mean the action which results in the best consequences for all affected, according to the degree in which they are affected.\n\nFor example: Say a man breaks into my house in the middle of the night and screams out \"I have a gun and I'm going to kill any small children I see, I won't stop until I'm dead\". Assuming I didn't have a reliable alternative available wherein I could get my family to safety without causing harm to the crazed, would-be murderer, I believe the moral action would be to kill the human being, because all of the alternatives available to me would have led to worse consequences.(Once again, my ethical framework says that consequences are value-weighted according to their impact upon the well-being of ALL affected, in proportion to the effect it has upon them)\n\nMy moral take on abortion is much the same. In a circumstance where the mother's life is in jeopardy, the pregnancy is the result of rape, etc, or any other scenario a pro-life position would find sufficiently weighted in favor of the abortion, on what grounds are they justifying it, if not the net result of the consequences?\n\nNeither of the labels as you defined them seem to neatly reflect my views. If we agree there exist pregnancy scenarios in which the balance of consequences are sufficently negative on a pro-life view as to override the \"unalienable rights\" granted to us through life, humanity, personhood, etc., then I suppose I would consider my position pro-life.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't necessarily say I'm pro-life on your precise definition. I wouldn't say I'm \"against abortion except in extreme cases like serious, abnormal threats to the life/health of the mother or child\". I don't think a threat needs to be abnormal to be considered in the moral calculation, though it depends on your definition of \"abnormal\". I likewise don't require a case to be \"extreme\", although that is very conditional upon your defintion of \"extreme\" as well.\n\n\nThe only rational, consistent viewpoint I can abide, is to weigh the potential consequences of each scenario on a case-by-case basis, and then to choose the option which leads to the best consequences, regardless of the circumstances' extremity or abnormality.\n\nWould the opposing argument not be that we ought to choose the action which *doesn't* lead to the best consequences? What is it about extremity or abnormality that somehow overrides the entire calculation? My moral concern hinges solely on well-being, and would only factor in extremity or abnormality to the extent those factors altered the balance of well-being(which admittedly they both could), not simply for their own sake.\n\nSo with this being said, I don't know whether you'd define my position as pro-life or pro-choice. I'm certainly vegan by most traditional measure, but as I laid out, there are scenarios in which my ethical system would allow the killing of a bear(or a pig, or a dog, or a human) Does that invalidate my vegan label? If so that's fine, I'm not interested in fitting neatly beneath a label, I'm only interested in doing the right thing.\n\nI think the killing of a human being(or a non-human animal) is irrefutably immoral, in a vacuum. But when we aren't in a vaccum, it's the nuances of context, and impact upon well-being which determines an action's morality. \n\nIn the vast majority of the cases it is wrong to kill a pig, a bear, an adult human, or an unborn baby, but on my ethical view there do exist(albeit uncommon) circumstances in which doing so may be the morally correct action.\n\n---\n\nI hope that made sense. In fairness I haven't spent enough time in my life comprehensively weighing the merits of each side, and I am very much open-minded to new and opposing takes. Always willing to change my mind with new evidence :)\n\n>I have lately began to have some ethical/philosophical problems with eating meat, and I could see myself heading in the direction of vegetarianism or veganism.\n\nThis is pretty much how it went for me as well. Grew up eating meat, dairy, and eggs at pretty much every meal. All my friends and family as well. Never even met a vegetarian, let alone a vegan.\n\nOnce I started questioning the morality, it quickly became clear that I couldn't justify continuing on. I could either align my actions with my values, or make excuses and live in denial. The only regret I have is not having made the switch sooner. It's so much easier than I expected, and with social acceptance increasing rapidly, companies like Beyond Meat growing in popularity, it only gets easier every day.\n\nWhether or not you agree with my take on the ethics of abortion, I hope you don't let that cloud your recognition that supporting animal agriculture in today's day and age, with plant-based alternatives widely and easily accessible, is an undeniably immoral action, and we can greatly improve well-being just by making minor, personal adjustments in our purchasing habits. We don't need to rely on massive systemic change or government overhaul. We can make a substantive change today, right this second, by reaching our hand over 6 inches at the grocery store and grabbing oat milk rather than cow's milk. Or leaving the cow meatballs off your spaghetti.\n\nEDIT: Lastly I want to add that vegetarianism as it's commonly practiced, which allows for the purchase and consumption of dairy and eggs, is wholly irrational by any ethical framework I'm familiar with. With minor research it becomes clear that support of the dairy and egg industries are at best *as* immoral as supporting the animal flesh industry, and at worst are orders of magnitude more damaging to the well-being of those affected.

Range land is generally land that is only suitable for grazing and if basic guidelines are followed grazing cattle has minimal impact or in most cases a positive impact on the land. \n\nSo while we need more land for cows, we have a much broader range of suitable land that we can use.

Both practices are the only thing that allows Pakistan to grow food, but both destroy a vital resource- topsoil. \n\nPlant based diets at the scale required to feed the world require modern farming practices. Modern farming practices are essentially ecocide in favor of soy and other monocrops. Of course even  worse modern plant based diets mean exotic food flown from half way around the world.  There are precious few places in this world where one can live a plant based existence without a massive carbon footprint.
