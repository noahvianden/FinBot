They could easily copy the Apple route.  The Tesla becomes the Macintosh of cars- great profit margins relative to the industry (because they make batteries cheaper than everyone else)- and then Tesla branches their battery technology into other products.  (They could sell batteries to wind/solar power utilities, they could sell their batteries to other vehicle companies, etc, etc.)\n\n\nWhat made Apple good at this?  Vertical integration of the supply chain.  What is Tesla doing?  Vertical integration of the supply chain.\n\n\nApple's Mac peaked and the growth rates have stalled with the rest of the PC industry which isn't really growing, but they found new markets in iPods and iPhones and Tesla can absolutely do that given their advantage (battery supply chain)", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, my view is that Tesla is copying Apple\u2019s business strategy that allowed them to take down titans very well and I highly agree with their strategy IMO, but having a good strategy does not guarantee success.  \n\nBeing bearish:\n\n* Apple had a head start in the computer industry. When Jobs came back and saved them and took down the big titans like Dell, they had an established supply chain. When Apple took on Nokia and RIM with the iPhones, they already had a supply chain for PC parts, they had a profitable Mac business line as a fallback. Tesla has no such fallback- they will have to operate at a loss or insanely low margins for years to get that supply chain built up. Tesla will basically be doing what Apple did except saddled with debt making it a lot harder.\n\n* Ford and GMC are vulnerable like Nokia and RIM were IMHO, but they have a lot more power over distribution. They literally have local lawmakers propping up their dealership model.  Apple was able to get Cingular/AT&T on their side.  Tesla taking on Ford is like if Apple had to compete with RIM and AT&T combined.  Car makers are even more entrenched than phone makers.\n\n* Tim Cook as COO in the Jobs era was a supply chain genius and ran the company like a fine tuned machine and literally bullied suppliers around for the best prices until he could buy them or build his own, or he\u2019d subsidize their developments of new factories with Apple\u2019s cash pile in exchange for first access at near cost.  Having a good strategy doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll have people of similar caliber doing as well.  The fact that Tesla can never make their deadlines is in stark contrast to Jobs-era Apple. Tim Cook as COO was a robot and Jobs publicly got up and ripped apart whoever was at fault when they missed a promise (like IBM and the 3 GHz G5), while with Elon you *expect* him to miss deadlines.\n\n\nTesla can 100% copy Apple\u2019s vertical integration model and still fail because they lack distribution power (dealerships), have more up front costs/debt and lower margins  (can\u2019t afford to hold on as long), and fail to hardball suppliers as hard as Apple\u2019s executives did because they lack Apple\u2019s cash hoard.\n\n\n\nOn the flip side I can absolutely see it working out. Ford and GMC are way too complacent and have even been protected by the US government from foreign competition. I think Tesla, for example, has a golden opportunity in the light truck segment - there\u2019s literally a 25% tariff on foreign trucks so Ford and GMC have massive profit margins.  Tesla can waltz in there easily and be competitive.
