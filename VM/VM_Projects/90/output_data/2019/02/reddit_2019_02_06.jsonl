They're just 2% from being right back where they were before they announced they were going to MISS BY OVER $500 MILLION DOLLARS. Let that sink in. A company is going to miss 20% of their revenue and nothing's going to happen to them. When they have earnings next month and they reveal they did in fact miss by 20%, but that they did hit their revised numbers, it'll probably go up!\n\nSo instead of having an earnings report that causes the stock price to meander for months, now because they revised in an uptrend either A) no one remembers or B) no one cares.\n\nThe problem with this is that it's going to make it harder to play the pre-earnings run-up for future earnings on any company.
