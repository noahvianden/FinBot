Those are two rather major variables. But there are of course a slew of additional pros/cons also to be considered. And it's near impossible to get a sense of the organic growth rate of the product segment (20% a year or 50% a year? Makes a big difference)\n\nThe general shape of what I think will happen is that Tesla will continue to grow in strength in a rather objective/holistic sense but financials will remain challenged for quite a long time. Increasing scale brings them closer to the kind of company they will be longer term, helps them to refine the processes that support that larger company, as well as all the factors that do benefit financials directly. It might be something of an untold story just how significant a change it is to go from selling exclusively cars with 30k$ type profit margins to cars with 8k$ profit margins, as well as the sheer factor of sales increase, when talking about internal culture and business processes. I am absolutely boggled by the complexity of this business. It is frustrating that dumb website businesses with 5M$/employee type productivity can run up to 100B$ type valuations while Tesla does all the actual hard work. Like Netflix. Wait, what am I saying. I love Netflix.

(bundling internet and content)\n\nLong term some of the improvements for Model Y get applied to Model 3/S/X ... rinse and repeat ... but that is not likely to make much impact on Q2 2020....\n\nFSD will get a boost if and when they say it is ready and awaiting regulatory approval, even more so when they say it does not need an attentive driver, but the cusp of that statement is also very dangerous, Tesla would be taking legal responsibility.
