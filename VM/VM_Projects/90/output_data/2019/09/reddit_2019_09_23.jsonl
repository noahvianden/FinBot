{"title": "Scared tendies don\u2019t make tendies. Are you a beta male fearful about the impending recession and not having extra money to tip that bartender that is totally into you? I\u2019ve got your back... Recession proof your Robinhood retirement fund.", "selftext": "I\u2019ve lost about %38.6 of my testosterone the last two weeks coming on WSB, solely due to the low energy and timid wankers that keep crying about the economy collapsing. I\u2019m tired of you sissies dragging down my machismo so I will do you a solid. Invest in these three companies to survive 2008 V2.0:\n\n**MCD-** People need to eat. People who are poor are sad (I\u2019ve heard, I don\u2019t personally know any), and tend to eat more and eat unhealthier. McDonalds is a solid play here. Cheaper than actually learning to cook and tastier than that bullshit they sell in the frozen food section. They will soon fully automate all the processes and fire those poor dumb shits that should have starved years ago. $15 an hour for what? My iPad will do it for \u00a26 worth of electricity. MCD will be rolling in dough and bad dah dah dah, you\u2019re loving it. Why not BurgerKing? Because they will do it your way and not the shareholder way so fuck them. Also the veggie whopper? Get woke go broke. I wouldn\u2019t buy puts though.... plenty of fat vegans that need to eat. You heard it here, Ronald McDonald will be your mascot \ud83e\udd21.\n\n**CHD-** People like sex. While the economy has been booming, women get knocked up to lock down a successful Robinhood fund manager. The investors don\u2019t care because now they have someone to microwave their frozen burritos. That all changes. With 2008 V2.0 on our doorstep, everyone is going to be too broke for kids. Even third world countries are going to stop over-procreating for the mega depression that is coming. These poor people are too stupid to remember to take a pill everyday, nor can they afford normal healthcare, so this is where CHD comes in. Trojan\u2122\ufe0f condoms are the most sought condoms by far. The poor breeding stock will be extra cautious about pregnancies and will stock up on Trojan\u2122\ufe0f condoms. Will they actually use them all the time? No. But they will use them for especially nasty women they pay for sexist and as balloons for viral internet things. Long $VIRAL. Buy CHD (Trojans\u2122\ufe0f).\n\n**APHA-** Poor people are always sad. They are poor, ugly, and useless in life. The only way to cope with being poor is suicide or drugs. Pharmaceuticals are too expensive and again, poor people don\u2019t have healthcare. This is where APHA comes in. This is a Canadian marijuana company I\u2019ve been bagholding for months. USA plays are risky and expensive (everything Canadian is like %20 off because their money is poorer). They also are really cheap right now because they were built up by the scandalous canadian potato mafia (this is actually pretty close to the truth). Aphria is worldwide with a Canuck discount. \n\nSo there you have three simple plays. Bet on poor people being hungry, horny and sad and you can weather the impending apocalypse that will rob the boomers of their retirement just in time to save the millennials and their 401k loans they are going to take out next year to cover the student loan payments on the International Women\u2019s Gender Studies degree they got online. \n\nGLTA", "id": "d86bqi", "created_utc": 1569244214.0, "score": 189, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": "You forgot Dollar General.", "score": 96, "replies": [{"body": "Ooooo.
