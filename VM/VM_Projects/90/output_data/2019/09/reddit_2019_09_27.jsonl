They use the revenue generated from deposits on new upcoming models to pay their current bills and debts. Elons cousin in on record questioning this practice. This is not normal.

Solar City isn't the issue, its a symptom of a much bigger problem. \n\nHow many red flags do you have to ignore before reality intrudes on this idealized notion of what Tesla actually is?
