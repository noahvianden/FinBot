Let me say that again, the option will only increase in value if traders think the chance of it going ITM has increased. \n\nThis probability is related to the share price, but it's not like a linear relationship. You have to start getting close to the strike before you see really appreciable gains in the derivative value.\n\nSo when you buy an option with a strike so far OTM that you don't think it will actually hit, you are paying premium to purchase something that you actually think is worthless. And then it expires worthless a month later, wow you were right! \n\nStop buying crap that's too far OTM, your delta is tiny as shit and you won't see any gains and then theta comes in and eats your whole trade. \n\nIf you think the price is going to go up, pick a reasonable price target or buy ATM.
