Will they beat the 53k from q3? My best guess, 60k cars for Q4, which is well under their plans, but they will likely show a last month production over 6k cars a week and we can look for a plan of q1 2019 for 85k cars (7.2 per week averaged). With 3k going to Europe and the other 4.2 going to the North America. \n\nThey may beat the 60k estimate by as much as 5k (so 65k at the top end) if they were able to keep production higher in November than my estimate AND keep closer to 7k rate in December despite the holidays and such. It may go as low as 56k if they really underperformed, but my base estimates are on the conservative side I feel.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3041788935661316}, {"body": "Sweet.
