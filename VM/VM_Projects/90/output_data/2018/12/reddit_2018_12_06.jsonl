Hops are better off because they need to go to manufacturing to produce alcohol that increases the price of their product!  Weed goes straight from farm to store!

Oh you have a patent for this strain?  Ok well I grow it in a different soil and trim it differently and user different lights and temperatures.  A court will never give you the win.

CGC/STZ can immediately put CBD infused beverages on the US market. Watch out Gatorade. But drinks aside, expect CGC to push hard for its CBD soft gels to be run thorough FDA clinical trials for Veterans with PTSD.\n\nGatorade and CBD drinks don\u2019t compete for the same customer!  Manufacturing your base product into unnecessary gels just increases the cost passed to the consumer!  Would your veteran want this $5 gel or this $1 joint?\n\n> Some people do enjoy smoking weed. But there are hundreds of millions of people who would rather drink a zero calorie beverage or pop a soft gel.\n\n\nAnd there will now be hundreds of companies competing, and when there is no material difference between ingesting a drink or gel with strain A than one with strain B, those companies have to compete on price.  Which means prices drop, revenue drops, profits drop.  \n\nEdit: I don't know enough about medicinal licensing, but if I make the exact same strain so in the eyes of the buyer, it's the same grade as 'medicinal' it doesn't matter if I have a license for it - so I edited it to 'stamp'", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["bubble"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5531117916107178}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6074823141098022}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7468380331993103}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.778702437877655}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0675538033246994}, {"body": "I respectfully disagree with your comment, it's very short sighted and a tad ignorant. \"Where it's legal for years\" not sure what countries you're referencing my friend.

Anyone can grow it, anywhere.  Yes there is a play in medical, and I'm sure big pharma may outsource some grow ops but why not just contract work out or grow in-house?  \n\nTobacco companies don't own any tobacco farms.  \n\nName a corporation that owns a corn farm or a pig farm.\n\nThese are all commodities.  What about gold and silver?  No, but you can own the stock of mining, equipment, and transport companies.  Do you mine weed?  No, it takes nothing to grow.\n\nThe play on weed is in the selling, equipment, or transport.  Anyone can transport it.  Anyone can sell it.  So you need an actual 'weed' only website/store platform.  I assume you could also make a play into fertilizers with everyone growing their own weed and grow ops popping up everywhere.  \n\n>Let's give it 10 years and have this conversation again.\n\nBy then your stock will be worth 0.  Big beer is the only one interested in any weed because it takes away market share from alcohol sales, but not enough for a full entry.

If weed gets legalized in US, I guarantee these partnerships are over. Sure big pharma may contract some operations, like tobacco does to their farmers, but look at how many farmers they're going to be able to choose from. Everyone is going to be trying to undercut each other for contracts, leaving no profits for the shareholder.\n\n>Once USA decides to legalize, companies like CGC will be supplying us, they are already buying out the small guys...\n\nWhy only CGC? See my example with big beer\n\nSay you're right about everything. These guys win contracts with pharma and even retail distributors. No regulations are in the way. Their patents somehow even uphold in court.\n\nWeed is still dirt cheap to make, transport, sell, and use! The market will be flooded and completely over-saturated, not only with different shops and growers popping up everywhere, but thousands of different strains being sold.\n\nI hope you all are keeping track of the insider selling on these stocks so you can see how badly you're getting burned.
