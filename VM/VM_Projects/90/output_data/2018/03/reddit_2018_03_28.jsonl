{"title": "TSLA bankruptcy puts?", "selftext": "So as we all know Tesla burns cash like no other and needs to raise capital repeatedly just to remain a going concern. Sometimes they raise equity (and the stock price inexplicably goes up), sometimes they raise debt, and sometimes they take unsecured, $1000 deposits on cars that will certainly not be delivered on time. With Moody's downgrading their debt to junk status, and wall st currently taking a bloody dump all over their stock, insolvency may soon become a real issue. So here are my thoughts: forward month $50 strike puts are about $.04. $100 gets you 25 which would probably be worth around $100k if tesla filed. How retarded would it be to spend $100 per month buying these \"bankruptcy puts?\" Am I retarded?
