{"title": "Reminder this is r/stock and not a crypto sub; feedback welcomed.", "selftext": "The reason why we have a rule against crypto discussions is because this is r/stocks where we discuss stocks.\n\nLast year we had a surge of comments that were literally \"buy bitcoin\" in almost every single post on r/stocks, and it wasn't just a single comment, sometimes you would find 10 users stating the exact same thing, \"buy bitcoin\" or going into details on how to mine bitcoins; this is spam & off topic.\n\nAlso Bitcoin is not a stock, just like discussing buying & reselling sneakers is not a stock, these discussions are off topic and that reason alone was enough to remove posts & comments.  Unfortunately this wasn't enough, so we created a rule (see sidebar) against discussing crypto with a link to a sub where you could; we also made an automod rule to deal with this.\n\nIf you want to discuss investing in general, you can go to r/investing, which is mentioned in the sidebar (on mobile by tapping \"about this community\").  If you want to discuss crypto & mining you can go to r/CryptoCurrency.\n\nBelow is the automod message I wrote, **please give me your criticism & feedback on this**.  I made it informative to deal with some misconceptions & misinformation ~~(including GPU mining).~~\n\nYou can also see that when a stock is related to crypto, **I've whitelisted that stock (including this post) so you can discuss crypto** as long as that discussion is related to the stock (or this post), so it's not 100% removal; it also only affects top level comments:\n\n*****\n\nSorry your comment (link to comment) in /r/stocks was automatically removed as per **rule 6:  Bitcoins & cryptocurrenies should be discussed in r/CryptoCurrency.**\n\nThis probably only affects your comment if it was a top level suggestion.  **Keep in mind this is r/stocks and people come here for stock suggestions.**\n\nWe've whitelisted some discussions on crypto, but not all such as **bitcoin & crypto holding ETFs and futures (explanation below)**.  However **we allow crypto discussions on the following:** Coinbase IPO, Square INC, Overstock, XNET, MARA, GCAP, NVDA, AMD, and Kodak; this list will always be updated (see below to what won't be included).\n\nA list of the [rules can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/about/rules/), and if you're new to r/stocks please see the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) and/or [read this post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/4x1419/if_youre_new_here_read_this_post_first/)\n\nIf you're just wondering if cryptocoins are an investment, [read here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/are-cryptocurrencies-investments)\n\n**Please note:**\n\n* GBTC, BTSC & other crypto holding ETFs don't function like other commodity ETFs like USO & GLD.  GBTC & BTSC are overvalued, inefficient, trade on Over The Counter exchange, and unregulated.  Within a 5 day period where Bitcoins went up 43% for the week of Dec 4th 2017 while GBTC dropped 7% and BTSC fell a whopping 61% (people calling BTSC a scam is not an exaggeration).\n* ~~**AMD, NVDA, VISA are not affected by bitcoins**; GPU mining died in 2013 and since then everyone has switched to ASIC mining, check for your self [with this website.](http://whattomine.com/); some analysts say only 5% of GPU sales are related to crypto mining.~~\n* VISA is not affected by crypto currencies:  VISA transactions are around **$10 trillion** while we don't have a dollar value of retail crypto transactions, we have per second retail volume of bitcoin + eth = 14 per second vs VISA at 4471 per second (based on 2016, [source](https://usa.visa.com/dam/VCOM/global/about-visa/documents/visa-facts-figures-jan-2017.pdf)), source for [crypto transactions.](https://cryptovoices.com/transaction-volume/).\n* CBOE Bitcoin futures (XBT) & CME Bitcoin futures are not stocks and don't affect the stock market like other commodities:\n * Oil futures affect the stock market because the energy industry depends heavily on the price of oil.\n * Price of gold, copper, steel, and other metals affect several industries & their respective stocks, not to mention gold is an indicator for fear/safe-haven and affects stock indexes.\n * As of 12/2017, there is not a single publicly traded company that depends on the price of cryptocurrencies.  **As that changes I'll whitelist those specific stocks until** there's a recognized sector and I'll release the floodgates of posts.  Until then, see r/cryptomarkets, r/TheWallStreet, or r/Commodities.\n*  If you're wondering if a crypto crash could affect the stock market, lets put things into perspective: Bitcoin & crytpocurrency market caps are still less than 1% of the stock market at around half a trillion (12/2017) while gold is at 7 trillion, the s&p at 22.5 trillion, and residential real estate at 34 trillion; not to mention bonds & global real estate reduce everything I just mentioned into fractions.  [Source](http://money.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/) & [source.](https://coinmarketcap.com/)\n\nThanks for understanding.\n\n*****\n\nAgain this post is whitelisted so you can mention any crypto related keyword (as long as it deals with this post), and please provide your feedback which will help me whitelist more stocks/keywords; again keep in mind this is r/stocks.\n\n**Update:**  Based on feedback I updated the bullet point regarding the size of crypto market vs stock market, thanks u/yourslice\n\n**Update2:** Based on information provided by u/mike_996, I'm whitelisting NVDA & AMD against crypto related keywords.

You have this one opinion that at the very least is controversial and is very likely even a minority opinion, and you're presenting it as fact and annihilating any post that challenges it. If I think NVDA is affected by bitcoin and people think I'm wrong, let them downvote me and post comments correcting me. But, for the record, here are several prominent articles agreeing with me:\n\nhttp://fortune.com/2017/10/09/bitcoin-crash-amd-nvidia-nvda-gpus/\n\nhttp://fortune.com/2017/08/10/nvidia-bitcoin-wall-street/\n\nhttps://www.thestreet.com/story/14303801/1/bitcoin-selloff-hurt-amd-nvidia.html\n\nhttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/amd-and-nvidia-are-prepared-for-bitcoin-10000-plus-2017-11-28\n\n", "score": -4, "replies": [{"body": "The \"buy bitcoin\" spam has been dealt with around the time we implemented the sub rule and automod rule, that's why you don't see it.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.320036381483078}, {"body": ">let them downvote me\n\nAsk and ye shall receive.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for your insight.
