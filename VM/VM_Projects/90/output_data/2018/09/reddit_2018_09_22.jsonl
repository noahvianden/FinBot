", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.41989901661872864}, {"body": "The worst move China has made is reacting with tariffs of their own. That just reinforces the complete misconception that our tariffs \u201cget\u201d them and theirs \u201cget\u201d us. Which leads to the mistaken conclusion that since we import more we can tariff more and thus win. To the extent that Chinese leaders might believe this and mistakenly think they\u2019re losing, it\u2019s possible they capitulate. But I\u2019m not expecting it.\n\nThe truth of the economics is that our tariffs do enough damage on their own, and the right move for China would have been \u201cnothing\u201d. (I mean the right move in general is better IP protections but I\u2019m speaking from the standpoint of \u201cwinning\u201d a trade war.) \n\nLook at what we\u2019ve been hearing from our businesses. Whirlpool, who initially cheered a tariff on appliances, lost about 20% of their value on earnings report because steel tariffs are killing them. Walmart just announced they will have to raise prices. Micron had to lower guidance due to margin compression. This isn\u2019t Chinese tariffs hurting us. It\u2019s our own.\n\nThe US is a consumer-driven economy and our tariffs hurt *our* consumers as well as *their* suppliers. It\u2019s a little too diffuse to be an obvious smoking gun but will be felt. But let\u2019s say we weather that for a little while. What\u2019s it doing to China?\n\nWell, the intent is that it costs them manufactring jobs. This is hard to measure because manufacturing jobs shut down there every day anyway. Low-cost labor is a last stop before automation and they\u2019ve been churning through that. Reduced buying from us would hurt Chinese investments more than Chinese workers, and while China may tolerate the rich more than they used to that isn\u2019t where public sympathies lie.\n\nBut despite that let\u2019s say we do put some of their people out of work. (And that the rest of the world - who is fighting with us, not them - doesn\u2019t pick up the slack.) The Chinese government has immense credits, the opposite of our debt. The could make jobs and pay for them easily. And as a Communist country they have experience making jobs and much of the public is accustomed to taking them. Chinese people prefer private sector because they know it\u2019s more lucrative. But they can take public works jobs for years while the US is \u201cbeing unfair\u201d to them.\n\nWhat would we do if tariffs tick inflation up and GDP down? The Fed can\u2019t fight both at the same time. Do Republicans give in on a minimum wage hike when businesses can least afford it? (Having resisted during a growth period.) Do we stimulus spend our way into more debt at the same time we\u2019re pushing a creditor to stop lending to us?\n\nAnd in the worst case for China, if they \u201close\u201d. all they have to do is inflate their currency. They\u2019ve been fighting this for years, thinking a cheap Yuan will provide more jobs at lower income. (Which reinforces my assertion that people there will put up with a lot.) If their currency goes up against the dollar, everyone in China becomes wealthier and their prices go up, basically taking the place of our tariffs but with them as the beneficiaries. No relief for our consumers, less funding of our debt, but equal value of imports and exports. That\u2019s what we\u2019re pushing them *into*.\n\nSo I don\u2019t see a reason why China has to fold and stop pushing self-suffiency. They aren\u2019t trade-dependent because they have excess cash and are conditioned to obey the government. We built up a big deficit and have a distrust of government (even if we\u2019re willing to overlook it for partisanship at times).\n\nWhat we should be doing is thanking them for cheap supplies while we use that efficiency to position for growth into future markets. Instead we\u2019re trying to steal jobs from a country that\u2019s poorer than us.
