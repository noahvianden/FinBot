{"title": "Feeling of greediness and fear of missing out.", "selftext": "November 2017 I out of curiosity looked up some stocks and charts and set it to 'YTD' and I was amazed at how many stocks had gotten 40%+ gains in just 10-11 months. Here I was thinking I'd be happy with a 4% time deposit but couldn't find any that high. Got my finances lined up to start investing in stocks, I couldn't believe even from November 2017 to January 2018 I had missed out on so many gains. Put a decent sum of money pretty much at once in a few different stocks in end of January. A few days later correction occurs, [largest drop in dow history](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/02/05/dow-falls-300-points-open-extending-declines-last-week/306400002/). I was not too worried about it, i was and still am in it for the long run. I was hoping to have a 4% gain by December 2018, that was my goal. I have now exceeded that goal, but feel disappointed that I'm still in losses in WMT, JD, BRK.B, etc. \n\nI don't get strong feelings like this often so just please allow me to express whatever I have on my mind. Feeling regret that I didn't put more in AAPL and AMZN, but feel glad that I at least invested in them. AMZN in particular though is the second reason why I invested, I feel like I should have just put like most or all of my money in AMZN and an S&P ETF. I could have put a lot more into AMZN but I listened to people saying 'don't ever invest everything into 1 stock', I feel this was fair enough, trump made a tweet about AMZN and it went back down to thirteen hundred something, I felt reassured glad I didn't invest a higher percentage into AMZN, but now I just feel lots of regret. These bull markets won't occur again for another 10+ years. AMZN will never hit 1300 or 1400 again, I've missed the chance. I'm still interested in putting a lot more money into AMZN but I've lost a bit of confidence at the current price of $2000. It's getting very risky at this price point and I'm being greedy, I want high reward without much risk, goes without saying. \n\nNow I'm seeing these weed stocks, I don't know what I'm doing, am thinking about getting into them. Was checking it out a few months ago and people kept saying 'it's too late, if you haven't invested, you've missed your chance' so I left it. Then I checked it again this week and saw CGC go from $26 to $45 in just 2 or 3 weeks (increase of 70%). I'm getting feelings like holy shit that's insane imagine if I had put a good chunk of cash into that! I missed my chance again. I'm getting feelings akin to imagining winning the lottery. That' all, thanks for reading. Would appreciate any guidance to a newbie like me.

But many will give it a shot when side by side with alcohol, especially when the big names rebrand marijuana as an adult beverage without the hangover.\n\nI think a lot of these companies are using rec legalization in Canada as a test market. I'm sure those who are most successful will have a foot in the door when the US finally changes the laws, whether it be in 5 years or 20.\n\nObviously marijuana can't change society as much as something like the iPhone.
