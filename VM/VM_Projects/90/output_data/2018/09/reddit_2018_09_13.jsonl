Likely at this point due to serious theta decay not a whole ton, but not zero. So since amazon stock went up today, that means the small percentage chance it had of hitting the strike point increases so your contract value went up. At this point your option is probably close to zero, so if you wanna ride it out and pray for a miracle you can.

I didn\u2019t have a problem with them until they started doing that. I think they\u2019d most likely split it up by division. If they just made two different websites or 5 one would win out pretty quickly. Aws, audible, twitch etc would be broken off, the real problem is expansion into so many other areas of business. Ideally they\u2019d somehow break up the retail side of it too but it would be hard to figure out how to do it.
