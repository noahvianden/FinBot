It's nice that's above zero but it doesn't support 60B$+ valuations. Honestly I don't expect any better than that.\n\nSo the growth ramp is already priced in I think, just not enough. The path to ~2M vehicles is easily sketched out and Tesla's net margins in the longer term will blow away the traditional status quo even of a Toyota due to leaner business model, software margin features, and larger lead within its niche than other companies within ICE niche.

If you assume that in 20 years time Tesla will be making $50 billion per year and trade at ~50x earnings ($2,500 billion equity valuation), you'll have earned a return approximating 21% per year. You'll replace Buffett in the investing Hall of Fame.\n\nIf you think in 10 years Tesla will be making ~$10 billion a year and trade like an automaker at about 10x earnings, then it would have a valuation of ~$100 billion, giving you an annualized return of less than 6% per year.\n\nChoose your own adventure/narrative.\n\n**Edit:** I underestimated the bullishness of this sub and have increased the range of the chart from 5% to 25% CAGR to -10% to 77% to encompass basically all possible outcomes.
