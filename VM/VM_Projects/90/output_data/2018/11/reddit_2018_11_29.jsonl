Actually it MUST be. I've seen so many people saying that the PE and high debt make this a ticking time bomb, and they may be right. But, when you look at the company you see: \n\n* A company approaching 150mln paying subs....globally. What other company can boast this? Even disney with their newly acquired goodies can't come close. \n* User growth has continued to be very healthy. Yes the US has slowed, but globally Netflix continues to grow very rapidly. There are more people outside the USA , than are in the USA\n* With their constantly increasing sub base, they seem to have decent pricing power. People may complain about $1 or $2 price increases, but the reality is, even at $15 per month, Netflix for most is a tremendous value. \n* Then we get to their land grab in india. As of right now they're trailing a distant 3rd place (or maybe it was 4th), but this market is still in it's infancy and the potential is huge. \n* They also SEEM to be making investments in things that will extend past just Netflix specials and exclusive content. \n   * Their investment in Millarworld and hire(s) this year in merchandising expertise suggest to me that they have aspirations to rival Marvel & DC in content & merchandising \n   * Their partnership with Microsoft for interactive Minecraft and other interactive stories hints at possible gaming aspirations\n\nThen we get to the technology aspect. \n\nThey have half a decade or more of a head start on the competition when it comes to content recommendation, content delivery, content presentation and more. I think people often look past this when they think of Netflix. They don't take into account the amount of money Netflix has been focused on spending on their content delivery, recommendation engine, UI for the plethora of hardware & software platforms their app is on (they're even integrated into hardware remotes for cable boxes, television sets, and more!). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd, when I look at the competition, let's look at \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHBO. \n\nWith Game of Thrones ending soon, Westworld and others lagging behind in terms of hype and excitement, HBO WILL have to pull many more rabbits out of their hats in order to justify long term, high value subscriptions. I just don't see HBO being very sticky when their content library while they have some tremendous hits, isn't (I guess in my opinion) that strong outside of GOT and a handful of others. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nApple. \n\nFrom all accounts, Apple will be spending a small fraction of Netflix's budget on content. They also will undoubtedly be making their platform exclusive to Apple devices. A huge market no doubt, but will still limit them. Add to this that to date, their content attempts have been utter trash. They've invested in some astounding talent now, so the jury is still out on what they'll deliver in the future. Apple is still working to catch up to Spotify, and from all accounts, Apple's service is almost on par with Spotify's in terms of what they offer a subscriber but 3 years in they are STILL trying to catch up with Spotify. Is it realistic to think that they'll be able to catch up to or replace Netflix in anything less than 5 years?  I see any service apple has as a nice value add for people who are in the iOS ecosystem, but not as a substitute for Netflix. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon has been around, and has had success, but they're focus hasn't seemed to be on streaming video. This shows in all aspects of their service.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDisney\n\nThe monster with the biggest franchises, the bottomless well of AAA content, and properties which span every genre. There's no doubt in my mind that had Disney invested in streaming video at the same time when Netflix was starting, Netflix would be a pebble to Disney's mountain. However, the horse has left the stable and Disney will have to develop and invest in everything that Netflix has been focused on for the last 5 to 10 years. if anything, I think people will have disney's service(s) in addition to Netflix. Add to this, that Netflix already has a huge global footprint in streaming, while I believe Disney will be focusing on the USA to begin with. Yes, Disney \"has\" hulu, but, Hulu has been around for years, and we see their success vs. NEtflix. Turning that ship around will not be a quick or easy process. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll the above doesn't even take into account the possibility (or better yet, pipe dream) of Netflix entering the China market. Currently they provide content to IQIYI, but, should that market ever truly open up, through their already established partnership with IQIYI, presents another tremendous opportunity for them\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll that said  they continue to burn money on content, and have yet to justify their VERY lofty PE. Given that the market seems to be looking at companies with questionable financials a little more carefully, I do wonder if most of the reward has not already been reaped from Netflix over the last 5 years, vs. the next 5\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "score": 158, "replies": [{"body": "Excellent summary, thank you!", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20002895593643188}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": " A lot, or all of it could be.
