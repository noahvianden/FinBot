Filling the demand for the full range of regular cars, roadsters, semi trucks...\n\nAlso consider they do direct delivery, aiming for 7 days from factory to customer. This eliminates a huge drain on the profit margin that the competition loses to dealerships keeping lots of cars in their halls.\n\nThey also don't spend much on marketing, so far they're getting more demand than they can supply by word of mouth and news reporting. This may change as the market start getting saturated, but I think that's gonna be a few years yet. They're gonna be busy just building more factories to keep up with the flood of orders.\n\nThen we have some really big possibilities that are a bit more uncertain. The house and large scale batteries, how big is that going to be. There's a huge market for power storage solutions as we adopt wind and solar that swings up and down in production over the day and to eliminate the need for a lot of peaker plants. House batteries is likely to grow into an enormous market as well as people open their eyes to the possibilities of cost savings and being less reliant on the grid.\n\nThen they have the solar roof coming at some point. Not sure if that's going to be a huge hit or just a novelty. If it's a hit, there's a leading product with a huge market.\n\nAlso they make the best car battery packs, if the competition decides to go with Tesla as supplier for that, then we have a Tesla that sells as many cars as any competing company as well as selling a lot of batteries to the competition.\n\nSo put all that together and try to estimate how big they could become.

The debt concerns and Tesla's ability to produce are big deals, and while Musk will never admit it, the reason why Tesla doesn't have model years for their cars is because they can't afford to actually redesign any of their cars with any regularity.\n\nIronically, the thing that helped sustain Tesla to where it is now\u2014government desire for alternative energy cars\u2014may also be its demise as governments the world over incentivize automakers to produce electric vehicles.
