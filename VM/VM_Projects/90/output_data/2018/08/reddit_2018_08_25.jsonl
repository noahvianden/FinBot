They've ceased to become a place of higher learning and are nothing more than social experiments at this point. A place where kids stand around screaming they're oppressed while they demand their own segregated dorms. A place where they call their own liberal teachers racist and demand their firing over telling them to dress however they want for Halloween. An institution where if someone decides to show up on campus to speak about different ideas they may not agree with, they decide instead to start fires, assault other students that want to hear that particular talk, and get a nice little riot going. I was being kind when I said uneducated, but certainly also intolerant and quite possibly psychotic. The so called professors are another story entirely. There's maybe a small handful of careers someone should attempt pursuing college for these days: Doctor, Lawyer, Engineer (all disciplines including software), Economics/International Finance, The Sciences, and maybe a small handful of others for various pre-requisites to a particular career. However that last one is something that changes dynamically. Hostility should be expected.\n\nIt is ironic for a self-professed socialist living in a capitalist society of which he criminalizes in every speech he gives, to be sitting on 3 houses and $2 million dollars all while speaking for the disadvantaged or lower status citizens wanting to elect him that that same system doesn't work.\n\nThe economics of socialism can be simply explained as nothing more than a ponzi scheme. They start out smoothly, running like a finely oiled machine but eventually it all comes crashing down because the economy can't sustain itself. And that's after the massive amount of casualties that it ultimately brings with it. The soviet union stood for 74 years and toward the end you couldn't even find shelves with food on them in the grocery stores. People lined up for food from the state.

People don't need to watch left/right anything to be aware of any of this. If you don't think certain groups aren't being hostile to others over various ideologies to the point of physical assaults instead of simply exchanging ideas you're not paying attention. Free speech seems to be quite the topic of resentment these days. Applications have gone down considerably probably for a multitude of reasons but people are certainly taking into account what's happening on campus and choosing other career paths. Marxism completely captured the intellectual classes of the whole world for over a century, much of it starting within the walls of academia. In China it\u2019s still the official orthodoxy, taught in schools. In the West it\u2019s still with us, if in the morphed form of Cultural Marxism.\n\nYou should let Bernie know he isn't a socialist because I don't think he got the memo. Capitalists don't typically talk about the things he does. But that's how it always starts, bringing equality to the classes, usually ends up pretty violent. In fact this last election was pretty violent now that I think about it. That's where things are at right now. Political correctness, the most effective way to silence alternative viewpoints under the guise of virtue. It's evident everywhere. As for Warren Buffet he's always said things like that and I'm not against the criminal banks not only paying more in taxes but also serving time for the crimes they commit, like with the housing collapse. But as it stands both sides pass laws that create tax loopholes for all these people. With very inventive accounting one can get away paying less taxes. Just the same though, the people that do attain 7 and 8 figure salaries every year certainly do pay more taxes. The IRS certainly has it's favorites as well. Crony capitalism, which isn't something I've ever defended. \n\nThe Soviet union was essentially Leninist/Communist along with the brutal purges of Stalinism. And we can say what we want about it, but that communist party was extremely loyal because of how it worked. But you can't get to either of those without socialism first, one transcends the other. It's a ponzi scheme because the money eventually runs out or hyper inflation reaches critical mass due to shit economic policy. We've seen the countries that adopt it go through great conflict the last three centuries. And yes, command economies are typically staples of communism but everything starts as something else. All economies collapse or crash at some point, we've yet to find perfection in policy or the numbers but the resilience of capitalism seems to be why people from the other types of governments mentioned all tend to want to come here over anywhere else if given the choice.", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "That's cool, I'm going to the cigar lounge anyway.

Brooklyn on the other hand is majority African-American, who leaned much more heavily towards Clinton. That's all besides the point though, the fact that the DNC favored Clinton is undeniable but also not surprising seeing as she had been a central part of the party for decades. But somehow you Bernie folk have had to latch onto Trump's conspiracy theories about the actual votes and voter rolls being manipulated in her favor for which there is zero evidence.

The DNC should have been dissolved for violating it's constitution and this problem would be solved.\n\n>Not going to happen in the US with the electoral college, Republicans would win for decades if there was a party split.\n\nDo you polarized party members ever get tired of saying this kind of thing??? You're always like \"OMG the opposing candidate is the *absolute* *WORST*, it'll be the holocaust if they get elected!!! That's why you need to overlook all these crimes my candidate did, ignore that we didnt actually give you a choice, and forget that you wanted someone with actual ideals; BUT JUST THIS ONCE BECAUSE THEY'RE THE WORST!!!!!!!!!1!!!1!!!ONE!!!!!!\" Rinse, repeat. \n\nYeah that's why the dems lost last election, why they're losing all their seats, and why they'll lose 2020. I was told that if I didn't vote for Hillary it would be a vote for Trump, so next election I'm going to cut out the middle man and straight up vote for Trump. Corruption is worse than character. \n\nAnd also, if you're right that the DNC won't give up it's hold on power and would cause a party split... Then yeah the republicans will continue to win, because they at least allow their people to actually vote XD Voting for the DNC is literally allowing a corporation to decide your vote in the presidental election. LITERALLY. They are a corporation and will decide the candidate behind closed doors, so no thanks I'll take Trump any day over allowing CEOs to pick for me, thx.
