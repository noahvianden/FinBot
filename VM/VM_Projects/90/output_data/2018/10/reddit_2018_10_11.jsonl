Marlboro is their bread and butter and it's flat at best. The US has a hard on against cigarette companies, and when [people see this kind of article they attack them even more.](https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2018-10-10-Lung-Cancer-Deaths-are-28-Percent-Lower-in-California.aspx)\n\nThey are betting the farm on their IQOS smokeless device.

They are [waiting on FDA approval for the IQOS in the USA ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-international-tries-risky-move-making-cigarettes-extinct-181322924.html) and they won't get it. \n\nJUUL has dominated the US market and its now [coming under extreme scrutiny from the FDA](https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/02/health/fda-juul-e-cigarette-surprise-inspection-bn/index.html). This does not bode well for $PM getting the go ahead they want for their IQOS, which as they say themselves, is all they have left.\n\nThey are going to guide down again and if they lower the dividend they're fucked. They're up over 8% the past month for no reason, and if you're a TA fag you can see them hit the ~$86 resistance yesterday and it's falling today.\n\nThis stock is going to dip to ~$76 the morning of. Sell immediately because old fucks like to BTFD, especially during this tech selloff cause they think $PM is a safe haven.\n\n#VapeNaysh\n\nEdit 1:10 est: Looks like Wallstreet reads our DD.

That being said, the FDA has never approved a device like this, so PM would really have to knock it out of the park. Seems like a long shot but not impossible.
