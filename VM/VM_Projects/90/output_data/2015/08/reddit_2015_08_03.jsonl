AAPL killed earnings this quarter, but news outlets keep putting out either misleading headlines, or completely misinformed/false headlines  that they missed earnings.\n\nThat dropped AAPL from ~133 to about ~122. After the overreaction, AAPL went back up to 125-127 last week, before falling back down to ~121-122 based on weak ipad sales numbers. \n\nOther headlines that are coming out recently that are misleading is that AAPL is struggling in China. That's absolute nonsense. They are in NO way struggling. They've been growing year over year, and had a fantastic quarter in China. The only thing is, so has Huawei and Xiaomi. AAPL is no longer the largest smartphone maker in China, but that doesn't mean it is performing poorly. \n\nSamsung has not gotten anything together.

Killer apps are coming. Also, the Watch wasn't supposed to make them $100B, but rather to intensify the HW/SW ecosystem that no loyal Apple consumer will ever leave.\n- Smartphones can always get better.
