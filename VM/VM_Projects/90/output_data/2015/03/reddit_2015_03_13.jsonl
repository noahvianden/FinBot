Certainly, many companies have stock go up and down for many reasons, but fundamentally, I don't see Apple doing anything *innovative*.  Like Microsoft, they're beginning to stagnate.  And remember, Microsoft had a *huge* golden age.  They were bigger once then Apple is now, and just like Apple, nobody believed that Microsoft would do anything but keep going up.  There were Microsoft fanboys left and right.  Microsoft had their own certification and training programs and had pretty much cornered the market on operating systems.\n\nBut Microsoft stopped *innovating*.  They decided that Windows alone was a big enough cash cow that they could just sit back and fund stupid side projects and just dick around.  They're not even valued at half of what they were back then any more.  \n\nSame thing with Apple.  Ask yourself what was truly innovative about Apple in the past.  iPod?  Definitely.  Revolutionized the MP3 player market.  It did things *differently* than current MP3 players did on the market.  The iPod held more songs.  It had a much more attractive interface for playing those songs.  It came with cool-looking headphones.  It looked beautiful compared to virtually any other MP3 device on the market at the time, and had decent battery life.  \n\niPhone? Definitely.  It was the first smart phone that allowed the user to type on the screen without needing a stylus and without having to write in some stupid shorthand script.  The interface wasn't hideous, and it didn't \"lock you in\" to using a small handful of abominable office apps--you could just install something better from the App store.  They provided a framework for developers to build apps, which started the first mobile app market.  Apple put a lot of thought into the look and feel of the iPhone interface.  *And*, Apple marketed the iPhone as another way to store your music after your iPod began to show its age.  All of those factors helped the iPhone sell like crazy--not some stupid fanboyism (which originated around that time).\n\nBut what now? Apple sat back and released a few more upgraded iPhones, which didn't deviate too much from the previous iPhones.  Yes, they added a fingerprint scanner, better camera, and some other bells and whistles, but nothing game-changing.  Their laptops haven't had anything innovative happen since the inception of OSX.  They've just been keeping them up to date by releasing better hardware.\n\nAnd now, they've released a smartwatch, which, at least from the presentation, didn't seem to offer any value on top of what other companies have already pioneered.  When the Google Watch standard came out, they created a market for smart watch apps.  Great.  That's already been done.  What about the fitness aspect?  Already done by somebody else.  All Apple seems to have added to the smart watch market is interchangeable straps.  \n\nIt seems like Apple is slowly shifting from a culture of \"check out this cool new thing that nobody's done before!\" to \"buy our stuff! we're Apple and it's a status symbol and therefore we're better!\".  You can only get so big doing that, and that amount is \"less big\" than they've already gotten by innovating--meaning they have a long distance to fall.  \n\nMeanwhile, people like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are all getting back to innovating.  They realize that the smartphone market is only so big, and they're moving forward with augmented reality and VR and all sorts of shiny stuff.  When the first hologram phone comes out, ask yourself, is it going to be Google, or Apple?  Probably Google.  Apple will be left scrambling to sail their way around Google's patents to try to bring something competitive to the market. \n\nKeep in mind, it's hard to remain at the top, regardless of how you got there.  Look at Mojang.  Notch made Minecraft, and he has tons of annoying fans like Apple that think he can do no wrong.  But what other successful projects has Mojang made since then?  Scrolls? 0x10C? They've got a stupid amount of money for an indie game company, but if they don't innovate, it's a short trip back to the bottom.  \n\nThere's also [this chart](http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2012/08/22/a-history-of-ridiculously-big-companies.aspx), which can give you an idea of how hard it is to stay at the top.

It's most certainly *not* the case.  Fanboys crop up for any major consumer-based company.  Fanboyism is a mentality.  An Apple fanboy may get really really excited about Apple products, but when some new, hip company comes along and starts pumping out awesome stuff, they'll jump ship just as quickly.  Fanboys don't respect a particular brand like they'd want to make you believe--they just want the best, most talked-about brand on the market.

You aren't wrong about the watch being a potential failure though. \n\nBluetooth technology has come a long way. Bluetooth, unlike before can stay on for a long time without draining the crap out of your battery (see Bluetooth LE). iPhone 6 users definitely won't see a huge drain and neither will the watch because of this. \n\nHere is why I think the watch will fail. \n\nThere is no clear reason why to have one. Unlike Apples big break through products (iPhone and iPods), there was a clear demand for it. MP3 players and smartphones was a huge growing market. Today for an expensive watch? Not so much. Ironically it's because of the cell phones that obliterated the watch market. Why use a watch when I have a phone to tell me time. \n\nThat is not to say the watch is only meant to tell time. It has a lot of other uses. The big emerging market right now is the fitness bands, like Fitbit. But their products are so much cheaper (a third), a very defined market (health oriented individuals), and proven product. it's hard for Apple to swoon the large mass that follow Fitbit. The watch is huge comparatively, it's heavier, and 3-10x the cost of a Fitbit depending on which model of the watch you're looking at. \n\nThe other glaring problem is the controls. A lot of tech reporters that went to the press conference and played with the watch all said the same thing. It's not as intuitive, between gestures, the crown, the other button, people were confused. A lot of reports said that it's not as intuitive as you may think and took them a couple minutes with a guide to figure out how to use it. This does not bode well for your average dumb consumer which probably knows less than a tech reporter. \n\nOn the other hand here is a couple reasons why Apple watch might just be alright. \n\nApple has had a few failures even under Steve Jobs. Remember Apple Hifi? You probably don't because they released it and didn't even stay around for a whole year. \n\nI think Apple TV is another failure that shows the Apple watch might just be alright and not a complete failure. Apple TV has been out for years ( I think 2007 release) and despite that it's still in the market. Initial release it didn't do much at all, like the watch they never clearly defined why it's needed. Compared to the market at the time, other devices did things better and cheaper. Although given all this time now, they found new use of it and integrated into a lot of their devices (AirPlay onto Apple TV) and despite poor sales it's sales good enough for them to keep it. \n\nI see pretty much the same for Apple watch. No clear cut reason why to get one, why I need it, and why it's better than anything in the market. It won't drag down Their revenue much (unless they made a shitload and pulled an Amazon fire) but it won't be on everyone's Christmas list. \n\nThat's my guess \ud83d\ude00", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Cant think of a single friend that will buy this.
