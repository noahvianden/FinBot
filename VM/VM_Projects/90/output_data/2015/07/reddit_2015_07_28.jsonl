{"title": "Year of the Shmita - How to Get Rich Before 2016", "selftext": "Every seven years in the Jewish calendar, it is the year of the Shmitah. Historically, this meant that jews would not plant or harvest crops and the economy would be lousy. The whole point of the Shmitah is that it is a year of rest.\n\nWell, wsb, we are in a Shmitah year right now. September 2014 - September 2015 is a Shmitah year.\n\nThe last Shmitah year? 2008, the great recession. The Shmitah year before that? 2001, tech bubble burst.\n\nThe end of this Shmitah is very close to when Mr. Yellen and the whole fed crew plan on raising rates. If rates are raised, there will a) be widespread panic and selloff, and b) companies will not be able to freely borrow money to buy back and boost their stock price. \n\nConspiracy aside, here is my prediction: A big correction/increase in volatility in the last quarter of 2015.\n\nHow to make money: Buy VIX calls and hold them until expiration. The best time to do it was probably last Monday but when Yellen speaks this week the markets may calm down and there may be a good opportunity again. \n\nA friend of mine spotted someone putting $2m into August calls last week on ToS and they're up 25% already. Good luck WSB. \n\nIf this all goes to plan, I will be flying to the Bahamas on December 27th, 2015, and you're all invited to join me.\n\ntldr: Buy vix calls for sept, oct, nov, dec 2015\n\n**EDIT:** 4 previous Shmita years for the conspiracy theorists / superstitious : [2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308), [2001](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble), [1994](http://fortune.com/2013/02/03/the-great-bond-massacre-fortune-1994/), [1987](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Monday_%281987%29), thanks to /u/hideous_coffee for pointing out the 1994 Shmita massacre of the bond market", "id": "3ewd9l", "created_utc": 1438091830.0, "score": 29, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "This subreddit is so ridiculous sometimes.
