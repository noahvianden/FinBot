He dates Tallulah Riley, an actress 15 years younger than him, after they met in a bar. He was surrounded by super models but had no interest in them, but she showed genuine interest in his work (and thought he was joking about building spaceships). When she got home she looked him up and realised who he was. They carried on talking after that - she was still living with her parents in London, and Elon asked her to move in with him. She had a really awkward conversation with her parents \"Hey Dad, I'm moving to America to live with this billionaire who is 15 years older than me\". She was a struggling actress at the time, so it was kinda like giving up on a career. \n\nThey got married, divorced and remarried, and now i believe they are amicably divorced again. She describes Elon as not just rich and smart, but also kind and warm and funny. A lot of his close friends describe him that way. As an actress she's doing pretty well these days, she was in Westworld.\n\nThe whole book is amazing and I highly recommend it for anyone who has even a passing in Elon Musk or his companies. It not only gives the history of the businesses, but also dives into who he is and how he thinks, and doesn't pull punches - they interview people with antagonistic relationships too, and Musk has made some really cold, messed up decisions in the past.\n\nSo yeah. He's a romantic with a big heart and an even bigger wallet, and an even bigger brain. If you hold stock in TSLA you should 100% read the book. Just Google Elon Musk Ashlee Vance.
