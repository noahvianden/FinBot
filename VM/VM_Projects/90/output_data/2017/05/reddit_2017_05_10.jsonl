There really is no reason for younger demographic (under 40) even to turn to ESPN. \n\nMost younger fans won't pay $$ to watch sports on TV. They rather just watch short clips and highlights on Twitter or stream them on various streaming sites (even Youtube).\n\nAs far as talk shows, there are dozens of independent Sports talk shows on Youtube. Even Reddit is destroying ESPN. If I want the most updated news on the NBA I just go to rNBA. 100% faster than waiting through 20 minutes of commercials on ESPN.\n\nBottom line is ESPN cutting talent is the exact opposite thing they need to do. Ratings will continue to tumble and paid subs will bleed them dry.\n\nBottom line is Disney/ESPN is tied to these horrible contracts with the NFL/NBA/MLB that cost $6 billion a year for the next decade. ESPN will lose Disney billions each year. \n\nDisney needs to sell ESPN ASAP before ratings/subs drop even more. Sell it to Apple, Google, or Amazon.
