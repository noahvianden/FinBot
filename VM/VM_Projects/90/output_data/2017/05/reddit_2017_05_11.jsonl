{"title": "Bro's wanna be a MILLIONAIRE in 10 years?", "selftext": "Imagine if you invested $40k in Netflix 15 years ago? Or Amazon 15 years ago? Most of us were too young to invest that kind of cash. But I see another opportunity right in front our faces.\n\nIMO, in 10 years SHOP will be worth $200 Billion.\n\nThat means if you invest about $40k right now, you will be worth more than a MILLION in 10 years.\n\nWhy do I think SHOP will grow to that valuation?\n\n1. eCommerce will grow double digits for the next couple decades. I can't think of another industry that can boast that.\n\n2. SHOP is the undisputed leader for small/medium business eCommerce solutions. No one else comes close. They already have 400,000 customers and are growing revenue at 75% YoY.  But its only the tip of the iceberg since there are over 20,000,000 business that Shopify can sell to. Its crazy to think that Shopify has address less than 2% of the market. \n\n3. SHOP will continue to add customers and revenue streams. Last year they added financing loans and card swiping. Each year they can add new services to the platform that will grow revenues and lock in customers into the platform.\n\n4. Amazon/Facebook has already deferred to SHOP. Both had competing products but both cancelled those products and are now referring customers to Shopify.  If those giants can't compete with SHOP's platform who will?\n\n5. The CEO is a visionary and the founder of the company. And he is under 40. Guy is a genius and has a strong desire to change the whole landscape of retail. Lutke has a firm grasp on eCommerce since he started out as an eRetailer but could not find a platform he liked. So he build his own - Shopify.\n\nIMO, Shopify will experience massive growth the next 10 years because of:\n\n1. General Growth in the industry (switch from Brick/Mortar to digital)\n\n2. Current customers growing sales (Shopify gets a % of all sales)\n\n3. Shopify adding more services to the platform\n\n", "id": "6akic1", "created_utc": 1494513459.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.49, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "Honestly I don't believe in any of this at all. Why? Amazon already has the entire eCommerce market under its control. Just look at it, they have already expanded to things like food, daily necessities and pretty much everything. My ultimate question is why would SHOP somehow stand a chance against the monster that is Amazon?

This means many wholesales will have to find other channels to sell their product. We also have literally millions of smaller business.

They want to setup their own online store where they can control the look and feel of the site and control the messaging.\n\nDo you think all these business want to sell their goods on Amazon only? On Amazon they will only be one of thousands of sellers. No. These business want to control their marketing message. To do this you need either a physical store front or a digital storefront.\n\nIf I'm running a business I'd rather sell my stuff at my own website instead of competing with hundreds of other sellers on Amazon. Also against cheap chinese knock offs on Amazon.\n\nThe challenge with having your own website is discovery and payment friction. You may have a great product but how do people find you? And when they do, will they be willing to set up an account and fill out 20 lines of info? The great thing is Shopify is destroying those barriers and making it just as easy to discover and buy stuff on independent websites as it is with Amazon.\n\n1. Discovery. Shopify is using multi-channel marketing. Advertising on Facebook, Pinterst, Shopkey, ect. Amazon is also partnering with Shopify. The new 'word of mouth' is social media and Shopify is doing an awesome job with social media marketing. In fact the top 100 Shopify customers have grown revenue over 100% in the last year.\n\n2. Payment friction. No one wants to setup new accounts for every site they visit. Its a pain. Thats why so many people love Amazon 1 click to buy. But Shopify is making this much easier.  They allow ApplePay which means filling out ZERO forms or account setup. And for non-Apple users there is ShopifyPay. You setup your account ONCE and then you don't need to fill out any forms on any Shopify website.

Why would I not want to control my entire marketing message by having my own site?\n\nLook at Brick and Mortar retail for the past 1000 years.
