If you think a stock price will rise, you buy a *call contract*, and if you think a stock price will fall, you buy a *put contract*. ONE contract represents *100 SHARES*. \n\n\nOP bought 76 contracts, which means his position represents 7,600 shares of TSLA.\n\n\nHe bought these contracts at a 0.61 *premium*. The *premium* represents the price you pay for the *option* to buy/sell one share at a specific price (*strike* price) before a certain time (*expiration*). So, if 1 contract represents 100 shares, and the premium represents 1 share, the price for ONE contract costs (100 x Premium). This means that since the premium was 0.61 when OP bought, and he bought 76 contracts, he paid (100x0.61=$61) $61 per contract. Since he bought 76 contracts he paid (76 x 61 = $4,646) $4,636 total for the trade.\n\n\nNext, we see that the conditions for the contracts are that it *expires* Jan 19, 2018, and the *strike* price is $480. This means that OP for each contract he owns, he has the right to buy/sell TSLA shares (*exercise* the contract) at the *strike* price specified before the contract *expires*. \n\n\nFor *calls*, if a *contract's strike* price is BELOW the current stock's price, it is considered *In The Money (ITM)*. If it is ABOVE the stock's current price, is it considered *Out The Money (OTM)*. I will go in to more details regarding this later.\n\n\nWhen you choose to *exercise* a contract (in this case, a *call option*) you own, it allows you to buy the stock at the strike price specific in the contract. This means if the current price of TSLA is at $500/share and the contract has a strike of $480, you can buy TSLA shares at $480. People will usually do this, and instantly sell the shares back at market price for the profit. \n\n\n\n**What happens if the contract expires?**\nIf a *contract* is not *exercised* before the *expiration* date, it disappears. It is no longer valid, and all the money you paid for it is 100% gone.\n\n\n\n**Why would anyone buy a contract with a strike price so far off from the current stock price?!**\nA lot of people trade *options (contracts)* around the *premium*.\n\n\nWhen a stock price goes up, usually the *premiums* for *calls* goes up. This is controlled the same way as the stock price (what people are willing to pay for the contract). So, if OP bought his 76 *calls* when TSLA was at $200, and now TSLA is at $230, there is a good chance the *premium* for those contracts has increased. And as we can see from the screenshot, the last bid/ask was at 0.91. OP has made money based on the *premium*. \n\n\nIf OP was to sell off his *contracts* (not *exercise* them), he will make $2,280. \n\n\nSince he paid $4,636 for the contracts \n\n76 (num of contracts) x 61 (100 shares per contract x 0.61 premium) = $4,636\n\n\nHe can now sell:\n\n76 (num of contracts) x 91 (100 shares per contract x 0.91 premium) = $6,916\n\n$6,916 - $4,636 = $2,280.\n\n\n\nOP probably didn't sell yet because he believes TSLA will grow a lot more within the next year, and those *premiums* will grow a lot more. He is betting TSLA will do good. However, this does not necessarily mean he thinks TSLA will reach $480 since he can sell off the contracts whenever he wants (and they become someone else's problem).\n\n\n\n**Okay, so where do all these contracts come from?**\n\nThe contracts come from the open market (aka YOU!). \n\nPeople *write* (or 'create') *options (contracts)* and sell them. If you write an *option (contract)*, you are legally on the line for the shares that you *write* the *option (contract) for... So someone, wrote a promise to OP saying that they will sell them 100 shares (per contract) of TSLA for $480 per share if he chooses to exercise the *option*. This is usually facilitate through your broker. \n\n\n**Who determines when the contract expires?**\n\nThe person who *wrote* the *option (contract)* determines the date it expires. However, there is a set cycle of when contracts expire.\n\n\nContracts expire on Fridays. Which Friday? Depends. By default, contracts expire on the 3rd Friday of the month. However, it is possible to *write contracts* for other Fridays during the month. It varies from company to company.\n\n\nTrading options that expire the Friday of the current week are usually referred to as *Faggots Delight*.\n\n\n\n**How do people lose so much money?**\n\nPeople make bad decisions. But there are a couple ways to lose a lot of money very quickly, like if...\n\n\n1) You *write (create)* and sell an option that you do not own the shares for. This is referred to as *naked* option (*Naked call* or *Naked put*). If you don't own the money to buy 100 shares at the current price of a stock, or don't already own the stock, don't be an idiot and *write* an option.\n\n\n2) The stock price goes in the opposite direction of what you thought. Volatility is a bitch. If TSLA has a catastrophic failure and drops to $150, those *premiums* are going to go with it. If they dropped to lets say, 0.31, OP will have lost $2,280 of his $4,636 investment. This can happen pretty quickly in many cases.\n\n\n3) You forget about the *options* you own, and let it decay. If the *option expires*, it's worthless and you lose all the money you invested. As time goes by, *premiums* slowly drop the closer they get to the *expiration* date.\n\n\n**Are any strategies to minimize risk while keeping a modest amount of potential profit?**\n\nYeah, I'm kind of tired so I'll link some more reading material..\n\n\n[More detailed info on buying Calls](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/call-option.aspx)\n\n[More detailed info on buying Puts](http://www.theoptionsguide.com/put-option.aspx)\n\n\nHere's a link to sites you can practice paper trading with\n\n[WallStreet Survivor](http://www.wallstreetsurvivor.com)\n\n[optionsXpress](http://www.optionsxpress.com/tools_research/virtual_trade.aspx)\n\n\nI'll try to answer any additional questions in comments....\n\n\n\nEdit: /u/collegefurtrader posted the origin of [Faggots Delight](http://m.imgur.com/E1Z1F9E?r)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "id": "5nqwb7", "created_utc": 1484317838.0, "score": 286, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "Are there faggots who buy way OTM calls a year out in high volume like this and sell the contracts when the premiums increase just a bit?
