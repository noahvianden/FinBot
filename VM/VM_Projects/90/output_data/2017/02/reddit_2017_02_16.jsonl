{"title": "A second DD on the Pebble Project", "selftext": "It seems some stock analysts are now telling people to buy NAK\n\n\nhttp://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/TD+Securities+Upgrades+Northern+Dynasty+Minerals+(NAK)+to+Spec.+Buy/12559754.html\n\n\nhttp://www.hotstockspoint.com/northern-dynasty-minerals-ltd-s-nak-stock-price-is-now-worth-at-2-99-what-analysts-say/\n\n\nhttps://www.newsoracle.com/2017/02/16/worth-watching-stock-northern-dynasty-minerals-ltd-nysemktnak/\n\n\n\nThe Stock fell today because there was a expectation that the Priutt's vote would sky rocket the stock, and when it did not people sold in a panick. Tomorrow is going to be the confirmation of Priutt becoming head of EPA, so be prepared then. For now buy the dip.\n\n\n\n**WATCH EPA AT SENATE**\n\n\nhttp://floor.senate.gov/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=2&event_id=1214\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA chart created for your convenience.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/KCQiv\n\n\nHello Everyone! I\u2019m here to give another opinon/analysis on what is going on with NAK. Three weeks ago I wrote a mini DD on NAK while it was at 2.9, and until last Friday it was steadily increasing until it hit a high point of 3.4. Please check out this thread if you have no idea what the stock is, as I give a basic outline of what it is.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/5qcakh/a_more_indepth_dd_on_nak/\n\n\nLet me say I did predict there was going to be a fall this monday, although I did not predict the flash crash which was a black swan. I will explain why I believed the stock would fall in a bit. Luckily I sold my stock last Friday, although I did it at 3.05 so I missed on some gains.\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/5t9lzx/nak_attack/ddmezwd/?context=3\n\n\nThe reason why the stock crashed this monday is due to the release of an report by The Kerrisdale Capital. The report states that they are shorting the stock and the reasons why. The article is very basic and has no hard facts regarding northern dynasties.  I covered majority of the report in my basic DD in a paragraph, except for one fact which I felt had little relevance which was that Northern Dynasty had a variety of large mining partners check out the project and decided it was not worth it. Why I believed it was not relevant was because that was a very different time than today, Trump is incredibly pro-manufacturing and shows little concern for the environment creating an optimistic situation for Northern Dynasty. \n\n\nAnother reason why you may not believe the article is that they, themselves state their economic incentive to create a panic which thus resulted in a flash crash. I bet their shorts made a lot of profit in a very small amount of time. Unsubstantiated claims have been made that Kerrisdale has a history of \u201cShort and Distort\u201d against companies, where they cause falls in stocks after shorting (I\u2019m unable to find a link for this right now, feel free to share a link if you have any articles that support this).\n\n\nTl;dr of article\n\n\n1. Alaskan Salmon Industry\n\n\n2. Alaskans don\u2019t support the mine\n\n\n3. Northern Dynasty had big miners bail\n\n\n\nhttp://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kerrisdale-capital-releases-negative-report-on-northern-dynasty-minerals-ltd-nak-and-announces-conference-call-schedule-300406711.html\n\n\nNow the reason why the stock was so vulnerable is that is a purely speculative stock. I touched upon this before in my previous DD, that it does not matter if you actually believe the mine will come to fruition. What matters is if other people feel good about the stock. That all it will take is a tweet from trump and the stock would shoot to the moon. I felt that the stock was rising too much on Friday without any news that was relevant to the probability of Pebble becoming a reality, so I was bearish.\n\n\nLet me say that the worst has already happened. People panicked on Monday, and although it has already started to recovered there is ample time to get in. The stock is speculative and thus volatile in relation to news, this Thursday and this Friday there is only good news lined up. Thursday will be the day Pruitt is going to be confirmed as head of EPA, expect the stock to start rising. Having a climate change denier who has worked his entire life fighting against the EPA is good for mining operation that could be disastrous for the environment, a quote from Wikipedia \u201cFor the latter cause, Pruitt's website described him as \"a leading advocate against the EPA\u2019s activist agenda\u201d\n\n\nThis Friday will be the day that the Pebble Project will release a rebuttal letter against Kerrisdale, in which they will list reasons why to be optimistic about the Pebble Project. Their business prospect is going to rely on this rebuttal letter, they are not going to half ass this. They will be trying all day to make this the most beautiful and convincing report they have ever released. Rumors have also mentioned that the Pebble Project has been contacting foreign investors the past couple weeks trying to get money rolling in. They might mention a big invester getting in on NAK to boost stock.\n\n\n**Update: It looks like Priutt may be delayed to Friday**\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Pruitt\n\n\nhttp://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Northern+Dynasty+Minerals+(NAK)+Responds+to+Short+and+Distort+Campaign+by+Kerrisdale+Capital/12545987.html\n\n\n****tl;dr People are sheep, bad news bad for stock, good news is good for stock. Goods news is scheduled Thursday and Friday ****\n\nIf NAK does not hit three dollars by Friday, ban me. I currently have 1k~ invested in NAK, and putting another 1k tomorrow. Note I am poor college student, this is pretty much all my liquid assests.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/FeyGl", "id": "5ucse0", "created_utc": 1487220579.0, "score": 38, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "Wtf is happening.
