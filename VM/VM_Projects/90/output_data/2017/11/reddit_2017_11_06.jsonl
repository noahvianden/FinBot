{"title": "Why I am Not Investing in Bitcoin", "selftext": "What is Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency and Blockchain?\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are a type of digital currency that is \u201cmined\u201d using computers. These computers use time and energy to decipher algorithms which lead to coins circulating into the currency. Some types of coins, like Bitcoin have a fixed number of coins that can ever be mined while others are limitless. As more coins are mined, the next coin becomes harder to mine, and it will take more computer power to find.\n\nBlockchain is a new technology that has come from Bitcoin and it is essentially a record of transactions of every bitcoin. This list of transactions is an evolving record and is added to simultaneously with any transaction. This means that anyone can see any transaction. The value of this technology is that it is decentralized, and no one really controls it. There is nobody to profit on the movement of value and it should create a more efficient market. However, central banks and financial institutions around the globe are beginning to develop their own technology. It will help these institutions become more efficient, and they hope to better serve their clients.\n\nWhy I am not investing\n\nBitcoin and other forms of cryptocurrencies are a bubble. Because of this, I will not invest in them. The long-term outlook of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies does not seem great to me, and I will explain why.\n\nThe Anatomy of a Bubble\n\nAccording to James Montier, in his article Behavioral Investing: A Practioner\u2019s Guide to Applying Behavioral Finance, there are five stages of a bubble, and I believe we are currently in the third stage. The five stages are: displacement, credit creation, euphoria, financial distress, and revulsion.\n\nDisplacement\n\nDisplacement is a market reaction that creates profitability in one area, while shutting down profitability in other areas. Now, this does not have to actually occur to begin a bubble. The perceived idea that it will occur in the future is what starts the bubble. The Dot Com bubble started because the internet was going to revolutionize the way that people do business. The same can be said for Bitcoin. It may one day revolutionize the way people exchange money, but how? Like the Dot Com bubble, investors are throwing money into cryptocurrencies without really knowing the magnitude of change it will create.\n\nAlong the lines of not knowing the magnitude of change is the fact that these currencies are unregulated. At any time one government or another can setup laws that either hurt the viability of the currency, or outright ban it. A popular conception of cryptocurrencies is that they are used to exchange money without any government intervention or insight. They are used to launder money or exchange illegal goods on a black market behind the backs of regulators and law enforcement.  All it will take is enough bad press of the currency for law makers to act on it. When ransomware thieves around the globe are asking to be paid in Bitcoin, politicians will eventually denounce the currency to win more votes.\n\nCredit Creation\n\nThis stage of the bubble is formed when there is monetary expansion and/or credit creation. This fuels the fire, and causes the bubble to inflate. As more money is thrown into the asset, prices go up. As prices go up, it fuels even more expansion because people are seeing great returns and want to get in on the action. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nCurrently, United States investment assets are inflated, especially in the bond market (read \u201cUnintended Consequences of Easy Monetary Policy\u201c). Highly liquid markets fuel asset bubbles, and in this case, they are also fueling Bitcoin. As investors have more money to invest, they need to figure out where to put it. If they cannot find an asset that looks great because valuations are so high, they turn and look at Bitcoin and think \u201cWow it has returned 2, 3, 400%, I want in!\u201d This in turn raises Bitcoin prices and makes another investor put their money in too. This is the self-fulfilling prophecy. Investors perceive the asset as being a good investment when really it just the demand for the asset pushing prices up, not value.\n\nEuphoria\n\nEuphoria is the third stage of the bubble, and I believe Bitcoin is in this stage. This stage is when the returns of the asset are so great that people invest because of the fear of missing out. Their friends tell them that they made all of this money in Bitcoin, they see charts popping up on their newsfeeds that say \u201cIf you invested $10k 7 years ago, you would have over $700 million\u2026\u201d This inflates the bubble. People see these images and get upset that they have not already invested. $10k into $700 Million? Who doesn\u2019t want a piece of that action?\n\nAnother euphoric characteristic of cryptocurrencies is that every company seems to want their own. Companies are having ICOs, or initial coin offerings, where they start their own cryptocurrency and raise money through the offerings. Burger King released a version of cryptocurrency called the WhopperCoin. This is just like the Dot Com bubble. \u201cCompanies\u201d opened a website and went public. Investors threw cash at them simply because they had a website. The same is happening with these ICOs. Investors are throwing cash everywhere with the hope that one of them will be the next Bitcoin and turn their $10k into $700 million.\n\nFinancial Distress and Revulsion\n\nThese are the last two stages of a bubble. Financial Distress is characterized as insiders see the end is near, and they start to get out. They sell their shares because they know they are not sustainable, and that share prices are going to fall. I am not aware of insiders of Bitcoin, but eventually people are going to cash out, and it is going to cause enough damage to scare everyone out of it. This will cause a spillover into the other types of cryptocurrency, and only the very strong will be able to survive.\n\nRevulsion is when people are hurt by the bubble popping. They are hurt so badly that they refuse to go back into the investment, even if it becomes a good value. This is the final stage of a bubble.\n\nSome readers may be thinking that the I am wrong and that this will change the future. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will change the way people pay for groceries, pay for movie tickets, and pay for their Amazon orders. They may not see or they simply ignore the similarities of Bitcoin to the Dot Com bubble. Well here is my rationale on why a global currency, without the rule of government, will not occur.\n\nFuture Global Currency?\n\nIf you were to ask me while I was taking my college economics classes \u201cWhat is the quickest way to make markets more efficient?\u201d I would have told you a global currency. A global currency would get rid of exchange rates, it would make transactions a lot easier, and it would make investing easier as well. It makes markets more efficient because there is no reason to worry about exchange rates. You would be able to go to any country and spend the same currency as your home country. It is like having a Euro in the Euro Zone, but for the entire world. The problem with the Euro however, is that some countries want a strong Euro while others want a weak Euro at the same time. If the Euro was not competing against other currencies, none of that would matter though. You would also be able to order anything online from anywhere, and not have to worry about exchange rates. Have you tried to order something you had to pay for in a different currency? It is intimidating and it will usually cost you extra money in fees.\n\nIt would make investing easier as well. A global currency means that you do no need to worry about exchange rates and revenue return. Suppose a company is in a US Dollar strengthening environment. As the dollar strengthens their goods become more expensive. The exchange rate works negatively in their favor, and it reduces their returns. the company either leaves prices the same, and sell less, or they lower their prices and their margins take a hit. Either way, the company loses revenue and their balance sheets weaken. The current monetary structure requires analysts to determine the future strength or weakness of the currency, and how that will affect revenue streams. A global currency can eliminate this. So with all the good a global currency can achieve, why won\u2019t we have one in the near future?\n\nIf there is anything the recent Brexit vote and election of President Trump have taught us is that people do not trust immigrants, foreigners, and globalization. Books can be written, and many have been, on why these are all important and good factors to a capitalist economy. However, not enough people understand, or want to understand how these help. Because of this, a global currency cannot be achieved.\n\nA global currency would have to be run by someone. It would require a panel of people from around the world to make monetary and policy decisions. There is enough people that feel the United Nations, NATO, and International Monetary Fund do more harm to their country then good. They have elected a president that threatens to restructure, leave, or pull funding from these organizations. They see globalization as a bad thing, so how could they ever go for a global currency? Simply put, there will be foreign people making decisions, and because of this they will never trust it.\n\nThe Future of Bitcoin\n\nLeft unregulated Bitcoin may stay around, but only to fill a niche market of money laundering and black market deals. Once it is regulated, it is hard to see what it becomes. It may become an internet currency, where users can only purchase these coins to do a transaction, but most of their funds remain in a normal currency.\n\nBlockchain, on the other hand, will stick around. The technology is already being invested in by most big banks, and even the Federal Reserve. This tool will make financial institutions much more efficient. If it can be properly implemented, bank processes will be cut down. This will save time, and hopefully keep extra dollars in their consumers accounts.\n\nThanks for reading and happy trading!\n\nGo to www.brtechnicals.com/blog to read more articles like this one!", "id": "7b1ml4", "created_utc": 1509928795.0, "score": 152, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "I'll play Devils advocate here. I've been doing a fair amount of research on blockchain so I feel comfortable discussing it's merits and use for the future. I do not like your reference to the dot com bubble. How is the \"dot com\" bubble doing? It's dream was to change everything. I don't think anyone could make a valid argument that it hasn't. Of course there were losers along the way. There always is with new technologies. But in the long term the technology has been proven and is growing even more into our lives. There are patchy start ups and pyramid scheme'ish looking companies being introduced for an example check out bitconnect. These \"quick buck\" companies will without a doubt come crashing down if they don't act with integrity. But in what world are there no losers when a new technology comes into play? We need losers just as much as winners. It makes the system stronger and weeds out all the fluff. \n\nPayment technologies are a huge business sector. After all payments need to be safe. What if the system we set up is backwards? Anyone with my piece of plastic that represents my bank account can use it if they have it, that doesn't seem right. Identity theft is also a major industry, do our names and personal information really need to be connected to our money? Fraud is huge, so is counter fitting, now people are creating fake gold, credit card skimmers, the list goes on and on. We pay a ton of money to keep our money \"safe\" just look how many financial institutions there are. How about the almost monthly massive data breaches we here about? Where everyone's informations is compromised, To me it seems the way money is transferred needs a major overhaul. It is inefficient, expensive, unsafe, and people are getting burned. \n\nIn steps blockchain, a global currency that is easily transferable between peers or businesses. Open ledgers that are verified between many networks and cannot be tampered with, counterfeited, or changed in any way. Money is transferred with pennies in fees, anywhere in the world. For the argument in huge national tragedies it would be worthless I guess I don't understand? What if the world burns down they will be worth nothing? We could play what if all day long. But the global value stays the same. I could trade bitcoin to an area not phased by natural disaster for goods or services. Could you do that with fiat money? It would be a lot harder to do. For example if I have a relative in Singapore that needs money pronto. I could send any amount in seconds. How would your relative fare? You would go to western union or something and pay huge fees with some transfer rate and wait for international money transfer verification for idk days and then they would have to find an open western union in a national disaster?? I think I like my situation more. \n\nI'll leave it at that for now as this is getting long. But I would encourage anyone to have an open mind to new technologies rather than shutting it down right away as a fraud just because it is too successful. I think the future could be bright here. The U.S. is usually pretty open to new technologies I don't think they'll ever try to shut this down just because it's new. \n\nDisclaimer: I do own a small amount of bitcoin\n\n", "score": 71, "replies": [{"body": "I think you're combining Bitcoin and blockchain as one package deal in your argument, whereas OP is separating the two. To take OP's analogy further, blockchain, not Bitcoin, is the equivalent of the internet during the Dot-com era. Bitcoin is one of the companies that took advantage of this new technology in the same way that Amazon took advantage of the internet. For the internet to succeed, it didn't need a lot of these companies to succeed. WebVan failed, yet the internet went on and grew. Pets.com failed, but the internet went on and grew. In the same way, I think OP is arguing that blockchain will go on to do great things, but that doesn't mean the Bitcoin blockchain itself will be the predominant one.\n\nSo while I agree with everything you said about currency and the need for easier transacting, bitcoin itself doesn't need to succeed for your ideas to come to fruition. It *can*, but it doesn't need to.

Just because WebVan was first to market with the idea didn't make it successful. In the same way, Bitcoin may be dethroned by a latecomer to the space. In that case, you would have been right in predicting where the overall technology was going, but you still would have lost your shirt had you banked it on Bitcoin.\n\nI'm not arguing for or against Bitcoin, I have my own opinion about it, but I think OP's analogy is pretty on point.
