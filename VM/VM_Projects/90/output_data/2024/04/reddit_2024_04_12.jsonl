Using the $70 per year figure, hired ride usage would need to be closer to 16 times higher than it is for it to break even cost-wise. \n\nhttps://qz.com/1715098/americans-are-spending-more-on-taxis-thanks-to-uber", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Suburban riders also go to work driving an average of about 40 miles a day in pretty annoying traffic conditions.\n\nThe stress accumulated during commute and the time wasted has a price.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah, but I\u2019d wager that most would agree that the shittiness of being part of traffic is that you\u2019re part of the traffic and not moving quickly, not that you\u2019re operating a vehicle in traffic.
