Usually the code for those operations is written using high level framework (like tensorflow or PyTorch) and behind the scenes the operations are broken down and use the appropriate backend's simple instructions, so that you can write code that is hardware agnostic (for example, you can write `c = a * b` and the result will be the same no matter what GPU or CPU you use; you don't care about the underlying hardware's architecture and how it would compute the result).\n\nThe issue is Nvidia (currently) has the best hardware so even if AMD optimized its drivers/software platform as much as it could, Nvidia would still have the edge due to more efficient hardware (it's like optimizing CPU usage as much as you can versus using the GPU \u2014 the GPU is way better at parallelization and it could be 100x faster than the CPU, while the CPU optimization would give you, say, a 5% edge, compared to the non-optimized CPU usage).", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["amd", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["amd", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3191452920436859}], "tickers": ["amd", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Here\u2019s AMD\u2019s stock future: If Nvidia continues upward, AMD will too.
