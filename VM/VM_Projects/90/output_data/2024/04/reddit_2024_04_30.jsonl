Intel aims to capitalize on its cutting-edge fabrication facilities and expertise to serve a broad range of customers in various industries.\n\nTSMC Geopolitics: TSMC's operations in Taiwan make it vulnerable to geopolitical tensions with China.

Intel is not sexy. It isn't about to post massive earnings while it pours all of its cash flow into reinvestment in itself. That reinvestment is going to take multiple years as these new Fabs and expansions to current ones go up. Intel dipping its toes into a foundry model is a great idea. The reason why is that it is placing itself in a position to work with almost any company of the likes of nvidia or anyone else who needs chips made. It is also working to match the abilities of TSMC with what nm process'es it can acheive. Also, keep in mind the cost of building these facilities is so high that the barrier to entry is jaw dropping. There are only so many players with the ability to make chips at different specifications and there is only so much capacity to service those customers. Nvidia is a profit margin giant because it is a design firm and it outsources its production to partners. What hapens when a competitor has a better design than nvidia, what do they have to be flexible other than cash. Intel may no longer be the go to designer of the chips but I doubt they are going anywhere for the foreseeable future with how they are creating a vertical supply chain and reinvesting in themselves right now. Not to mention the US Government isn't about to let their US arbitrage against TSMC go anywhere. Look at Isreal, they will continue to pump subsidies to ensure the US is not wholly reliant on a foreign company for chip making. The whole world is run on these chips now. Not all requiring 3nm wafer production with its high margins but Intel has just made itself irreplaceble at the present moment to the US Security. I am pro Intel but i think there is a strong case to buy in right now because of its valuation compared to its peers. If you want to buy a company that is hot and overvalued you can.

Bought some shares of VOO, JEPI, JEPQ, and a few beat up stocks that I like. Now it\u2019s time to transfer out the rest and put it in a HYSA (~5% will feel a bit insulting but the money is safer there). Lessons I\u2019ve learned - ignore the noise and stick to your plan. Take the base hits, meaning scale out at 20%, 30%, etc. and leave a couple runners once you\u2019ve taken most risk off the table. Market tide by UW is a pretty sweet feature. Use it to guide you, but don\u2019t yolo based off of it. Same with flow in general. Find a strategy that works for you. If you like quick scalps on choppy days, go for it. If you prefer trend days, try to wait for a retest for a decent entry. Don\u2019t be a shmuck because you\u2019ll end up blowing your account just to see an A+ setup that goes bonkers without you. If you\u2019re ever unsure of what position to go for, take it as a sign to sit out. Patience is the name of the game and conviction goes a long way. Best of luck to you all.
