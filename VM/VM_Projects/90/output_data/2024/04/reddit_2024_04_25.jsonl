{"title": "Microsoft earnings are out \u2013 here are the numbers", "selftext": "Microsoft shares rose 5% in extended trading on Thursday after the software maker issued fiscal third-quarter results that outdid Wall Street\u2019s expectations. \n\nHere\u2019s how the company did in comparison with the consensus from LSEG: \n\nEarnings per share: $2.94 vs. $2.82 expected\n\nRevenue: $61.86 vs. $60.80 billion expected\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s total revenue grew 17% year over year in the quarter, which ended on March 31, according to a statement.\n\nDuring the quarter, Microsoft introduced Surface PCs with a key for quickly accessing the Copilot chatbot. The company started selling access to the Copilot for small businesses with Microsoft 365 productivity software subscriptions and hired Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of artificial intelligence lab DeepMind, to run a new Microsoft AI group. Suleyman had been co-founder and CEO of startup Inflection, and many of its employees also joined Microsoft.\n\n\u201cWe have been operating with speed and intensity and this infusion of new talent will enable us to accelerate our pace yet again,\u201d CEO Satya Nadella wrote in a memo about the Inflection deal, which was reportedly worth $650 million.\n\nThis marks the first full quarter for sales of the Copilot add-on for commercial Microsoft 365 customers. In a note on Sunday, analysts at Piper Sandler warned clients not to expect many financial details from Microsoft.\n\nSo far this year, Microsoft stock is up 4%, while the S&P 500 index has gained about 5%.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/25/microsoft-msft-q3-earnings-2024.html", "id": "1cd17k5", "created_utc": 1714075599.0, "score": 510, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "When I got the alert that it dropped 5% today, I rushed to buy more.
