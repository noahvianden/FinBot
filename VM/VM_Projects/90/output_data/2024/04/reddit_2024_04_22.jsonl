Exchanges are directly supervised by the Securities and Exchange Commission and tested for their stability and security as well as needing approval to alter any rules.\n\n> NYSE\u2019s survey asked respondents whether they thought round-the-clock trading should take place at weekends as well as through a five-day week, how investors should be protected from price swings, and how respondents would staff any overnight session.\n\n> It also asked whether people agreed that \u201ctime spent thinking about overnight trading would be better spent on regular market hour trading\u201d.", "id": "1cabi7o", "created_utc": 1713794352.0, "score": 231, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "Without arguing for or against, it\u2019s hard not to imagine day traders doing 36 and 48 hour shifts trying to win big.
