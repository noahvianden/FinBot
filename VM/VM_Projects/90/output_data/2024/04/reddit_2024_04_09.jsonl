{"title": "YOLOing $30K into $BOWL options before earnings\u2014big announcement coming?", "selftext": "**Imagine you and your buds could $200m by increasing your company's share price 35%. You have less than 2 years to do it. The bull market is in full effect. What do you do?** \n\nEnter Thomas Shannon:\n\n[Who do you think you are? I AM!](https://preview.redd.it/bfqa60rd2htc1.png?width=378&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa93ee849b220408e776a8d4064b454767f61559)\n\nThis guy is the CEO of Bowlero, a bowling company (lmfao) with an extremely financially overengineered and rather terrible balance sheet. **He also made $65 million in 2022**, making him one of the top 25 highest paid CEOs! \n\nThis guy likes making money, and if Bowlero hits $17.5, he and his friends PAID. \n\nLook at this:\n\n[So there is an earnout, which means that if the stock price hits $17.5 for 10 days, there will be17.5 \\* 11M  = $200 fucking million for Shannon and other earnout beneficiaries. Who are these other beneficiaries?](https://preview.redd.it/wqiq1yfmxgtc1.png?width=2820&format=png&auto=webp&s=4041a017a6dabf2d6d13aae4c8c94d04ee8fd32f)\n\n**Private Equity and Insider Involvement**\n\nAtairos is a large PE firm that helped bring Bowlero to market through a SPAC. They own a TON of shares. It is my view that they want to get the share price much higher before cashing out. Likewise, company insiders like Shannon own another 40% of shares. So it seems to me that there is a pretty aligned group of smart people with deep pockets who stand to benefit.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bf7ys4dk1htc1.png?width=446&format=png&auto=webp&s=91ca7684d6863a212419f736daf589bc29b77223\n\nIf these guys want to hold for the share price to go up, float is effectively small...\n\n**Adding Fuel to the Fire**\n\nBowlero has been buying back its own shares with major buyback programs! Its float is already small and they are aggressively trying to make it even smaller. They have even taken on debt to buy back shares at times:\n\n[Let's just make our float a bit smaller...](https://preview.redd.it/9v157b3augtc1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=8045d15cc37adf11f88a2e94f7a4bc0600784abf)\n\n**Buyback Announcement Increases**\n\nPretty regularly on earnings calls, management announces increases in the already sizabe buyback. Over the last two earnings calls this has resulted in big pops in the stock price. \n\n*I think this is mechanical due to short covering, and spurred on by positive announcements. So even without the \"earnout conspiracy\", I think it's a reasonable bet to go long through earnings:*\n\n[Last Quarter](https://preview.redd.it/lynsbspvygtc1.png?width=604&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d0345c86cc10e6e0958d2349e19ddf54a1dda93)\n\n[Two Quarters Ago](https://preview.redd.it/1yegq76zygtc1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=31dea25426462898a081d7d2f5d14e8d5972598b)\n\nAnd why have these spikes been so violent? Well, Bowlero is highly shorted, because, as I said at the beginning, it looks like a rather ridiculous company and isn't \"fundamentally valuable\"\u2014whatever that means:\n\n[Note: I am not sure of these numbers. I see lots of conflicting info. Someone help out?](https://preview.redd.it/nqfgmo9t1htc1.png?width=1030&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3cfd46f9b8575aa9639f90d53d29906831d79df)\n\n*Earnings are coming up in Early March\u2014if they announce a buyback, or great results, or a dividend, etc., things could get spicy.*\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n**You and your PE buddies can get $200m. You love money. You've made your float small. You're highly shorted. Massive incentive to get shares up to $17.5. Aren't you going to do something that makes it happen on earnings May 8, 2024?**\n\nYOLO:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i858w02r3htc1.png?width=1664&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a0dff27c76c37b1d689a6ffe1fc9dbd0e1a287a\n\n*Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.

I don\u2019t own it, I don\u2019t short it, I don\u2019t do options with it.  I just buy other semi stocks that make efficient computing be it CPU or GPUs. Buying AMD is like shorting INTC without having to pay interest.   \n\nIntel is not that.  And I was a big Intel fan, I started working with their Nehalem design after college 15 years ago.  This cpu reshaped cloud computing.  It blew everyone away.  This Intel CPU changed how virtualization was done, we went from hosting a few thousand virtual machines to 10 thousand virtual machines in a small part of a colocation.  Our business  went 10x because of this and probably AWS did too.  If you ever owned I think a Sandy Bridge CPU from 2010 you\u2019d know what a beast that was built on the same Nehalem design and was useable for consumers for 10+ years (it\u2019s not a useable design for datacenter too inefficient now) \n\nFast forward 8+ years, Intel did minor tweaks if any to their design.  Great world changing cpu in 2008 but in 2016 that cpu was showing its age.  \n\n\nIn ~2016 I said AMD at $1.80 with their new design, INTC lack of innovation would be beginning death blow to INTC monopoly.  \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/\n\nINTC is not something anyone should invest in,  I\u2019m seeing ARM, QCOM, AMD, MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, AWS and many more just make better stuff, way more energy efficient.   Why do you think all new MacBook even an old M1 from 2020 blows away a current Intel, I can render a movie 10x faster on my phone than my Intel desktop, and my phone is only a few watts while my Intel desktop takes hundreds of watts doing things 10x slower using 10x more power and heat, companies are moving to Snapdragon, Graviton, ARM, their own designs, AMD\n\nIf in the last 8 years if you invested in any semi stock be it AMD, NVDA, ASML, TSM, MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, NVDA, QCOM etc you\u2019d have millions.  INTC some how in the biggest multiple tech boom and QE, and stock boom run has some how lost money in their stock price.  \n\nLook at the shit that was AMD Opteron bulldozer in around 2006.  It took AMD 10 years to redesign and have a CPU take off again.  It\u2019s a slow process.  If you are hell bent on putting money in INTC wait 10 years that\u2019s how far they are behind.\n\nI have never seen anyone ever install an Intel GPU for AI or even given it thought.  I\u2019ll look at other racks at colocations and I\u2019ve never seen an Intel GPU for this purpose.  \n\nLiterally just put a dartboard of semi stocks and buy anything else, doesn\u2019t mater if you\u2019re at a loss on INTC now the opportunity cost of holding INTC is too high when there are semi stocks that could change your life.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "the flipside is that it's not 2016 and the tickers you mentioned are *ludicrously* expensive.\n\nintel sucks, but the us govt is in love with them and granting them all sorts of favoritism, from taxpayer $ to exemptions from export bans.\n\nbased on their current valuations, i'd take intc over the rest.  but i mean, amd/nvda/avgo/arm are priced for insanity/impossible growth with insane margins.  and i loathe intel.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "I agree those margins are completely unsustainable but AMD trades at 12X 2023 revenue, Nvidia trades at 79X they aren't really in the same region.
