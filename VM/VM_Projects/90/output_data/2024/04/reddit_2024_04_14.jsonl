{"title": "Tesla's Quantum Leap (Again)", "selftext": "Ultimately Full Self Driving (FSD) is gonna be a winner-take-all market and a bet on which company will it be. With their new iteration of Video LLM based FSD, Tesla has masterfully honed a technology that now surpasses human drivers, ushering in an era of autonomous vehicles and Robotaxis. The future is no longer a topic of debate; it\u2019s unfolding before our eyes. The question isn\u2019t whether it will become a reality, but rather how soon.\n\nHold onto your hats, folks! Some out there are still waving the \"but...but LIDAR\" flag, but they\u2019re missing the memo: Tesla isn\u2019t just leading the pack; it\u2019s lapped the field. From cutting-edge tech to economic scale and sheer global reach, Tesla\u2019s got it all. \ud83d\ude80\n\nPicture this: Tesla, the grand maestro, orchestrating a financial masterpiece. Again. Imagine a world where they don\u2019t just own the Robotaxis they\u2019ve built, but they also license their magic to every other car brand on the planet. Some projections have it at $100Billion additional revenue for Tesla at almost 100% margin and 80% market share by 2030! \n\nTSLA to the moon again? or No?", "id": "1c4121h", "created_utc": 1713120957.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.23, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 2 years ago\n**Total Comments** | 51 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 5 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12127818167209625}, {"body": "https://preview.redd.it/72kdi3gjzhuc1.png?width=390&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=53199eda97386eb9508b4ad4fce9f4db94a24551", "score": 73, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08479141443967819}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 77, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.05258937180042267}, {"body": "This is the same company that is stopping Cybertruck deliveries because they can\u2019t even manufacture the acceleration pedal correctly.\n\nhttps://www.investors.com/news/tesla-cybertruck-deliveries-reportedly-halted/\u00a0", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "Who needs an acceleration pedal when your car has the amazing FSD ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "\u201cSupervised\u201d FSD", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "You only need the steering wheel and brake pedal to supervise.
