Back in 2022 COIN was around 40-60 $ a share and for whatever reason extremely out of the money calls still had huge premiums. Well, crypto at that time was in the shitter,  interest rates that were introduced in late 2021 made most tech companies fall extremely in share price, recession looked likely and the Russia Ukraine conflict made the market fall by a lot. In short the whole market looked like shit, especially the tech market.\n\nI looked at it and thought \"under this conditions, there is no way COIN will rally 20-40% in a matter of weeks. No fucking shot\".\n\nso I sold calls that were up to 40% out of the money and had  only 2-3 weeks till expiration. Again, nooo fucking way COIN would rally 40% or whatever in this market in like 2 weeks.\n\nFast forward a couple of weeks, I'm sitting in a restaurant and pull up my broker and COIN is going through the roof. +20% intra day. My short calls are now in deep red. I'm now several thousand in the red. I start sweating and closed some calls but not all. -12k or something. OK, that's bad but surely COIN won't go up further. I still had like 4 or 6 short calls open that were still like 20% out of the money.\n\nA day or so later COIN is up 40% pre market, my broker send me a margin call warning. This was pre open so I couldn't even close my position. COIN climbed to over 110$ a share. I'm in fucking panic mode. My short calls are in the money and I'm -35k on those calls. The market opens and COIN keeps climbing. I managed to close my calls probably minutes before my broker would have margin called me and liquidated my entire account.\n\nTurns out COIN announced their partnership with Blackrock and their Spot ETF. That's was the reason the premiums were so high to begin with. Insiders knew thus the premiums for calls looked extremely attractive. had I not closed some calls the day before in the restaurant I would have been margin called and likely would have lost 60k or more.\n\nHere is a lesson: if premiums are high and look like a no brainier, it's because the probability of them going in the money is higher than you think. Oherwise the premium wouldn't be that high.  There is no free lunch. If the premiums are high, the risk is high.\n\nnow the part the hurt the most. Had I held on to my calls and had I had enough liquidity to not get margin call warnings, my calls would have expired worthless and I would have made max profit with the naked calls. because COIN went up to 120 only shortly and after a couple of days was back down to 70.", "score": 53, "replies": [{"body": "Your story had me on the edge of my seat.

Which means i was able to close my position probably minutes before they tried to liquidate my whole account. I can't remember the exact strike prices I had but it was something around 80-90$. Coin climbed pre market to over 120. So they were extremely in the money.

Now the particular trade we are talking about is dumb and going to blow up, but selling option premium is statistically the best way to beat the market.

It sounds like you have your way which is perfectly fine.\n\nI almost exclusively sell naked calls and puts.  The amount of premium I collect over time and number of occurrences Far exceeds the amount I lose every so often.  The biggest statistic you ever need to know is \u201crealized volatility almost always under implied volatility\u201d.   This is the entire system that market makers live off of.  You need number of occurrences to make the statistics work, but the edge is there if you stay mechanical.  \n\nJust to give you a real life anecdote, I literally started selling naked calls on NVDA when it was in the 400s.  and I\u2019m only down ~$5k this year on that ticker (up overall even though it\u2019s been very frustrating with the market ripping, but I\u2019ve been profitable every year even through 2022.  Sp still beating me but it\u2019s very close and I sleep so much better knowing my destiny is in my hands).  At one point I was in the red $20k on NVDA.  But it all came back in once it topped.  That -5k will be positive by end of year.   \n\nEven with GME, I was able to profit and started selling calls when it was ~25 before hitting 800.  That was rough.  But the whole mantra is \u201cstay small, trade often\u201d because the small positions can get big.  I personally stop out when I take a 300% loss.  \n\nPeople are extremely risk adverse to the point they pick and choose what they \u201cfeel\u201d is better.
