{"title": "Hey guys, I just figured out how to beat theta gang", "selftext": "All right, here me out. I have been studying in ~~Batman's~~ Bruce Wayne's cave and have come to an incredible conclusion. But first, But first, let\u2019s established what the problem is; imagine this: I'm a highly regarded investor looking to limit my exposure to theta decay, want to hedge my bets with a much lower risk of 100% loss, want stupid perks some stupid companies give to \"stock holders,\" and also have a somehow negative credit score and even Jarrad from behind Wendy's won't give me credit?\n\nLet me introduce you to stock ownership. Have a bullish theory on a stock? You can just buy the stock. Did the stock go down immediately? Congratulations, you now still own the original amount of the stock that you bought. With inflation you probably even made money, just don't look at the number for literally a few months. Did the stock go up? So sorry you made a little less money. I'm so sorry that there might have been an overly complicated options play that you could have made more free money with. \n\nSpeaking of free money have you heard of something called dividends? I bought some shares of a company one time and then they just literally gave me money. It was actually a little weird. I had bought the stock and it immediately dropped 30 cents, but then the next day it went up like 8 cents and then a few days later I got 60 dollars deposited to my account. I forgot how many shares I had, but I bought several tendies with the 60 bucks. \n\nTLDR: idk I made $60 buying shares.", "id": "1cvby2i", "created_utc": 1716079774.0, "score": 197, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | just now\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 3 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21177935600280762}, {"body": "Take your \u201ctime in the market\u201d youtube snake oil and go hassle some retirees.
