And there aren't a lot of young people that can afford a 20-40k (second hand) Model 3 . A model Y is what 50k+? The average beginner driver is not spending that on their car. In fact a quick search shows they spend around 5-10k. A quick search also shows the average Tesla owner is around 50 years old. Not exactly beginner drivers. It's a simple fact that experienced/older drivers will have fewer accidents. Insurance companies in part base their rates on it for a reason. Hell I'd be surprised if you even get insurance over here as a beginner driver on a car with the performance of a tesla. And if you can you're going to be paying a hefty sum to insure it. \n\nTesla's are relatively new vehicles and if you go around comparing that to other brands who still have 20-30+ year old cars on the road (every major manufacturer basically) the statistics are going to be skewed. A more interesting and fair comparison is Tesla vs other *modern* cars, that is to say 10-15 years max in the same class. I'm willing to bet they will have very similar statistics. \n\nIt's also very logical that newer cars, with their advanced safety systems, are involved in fewer accidents. That's the whole point of all these systems. In modern cars stuff like city brake assist, parking assist and sensors, lane keeping assist and adaptive cruise control are pretty standard these days.
