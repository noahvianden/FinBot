You were SO CLOSE with your strike not being ITM.. had you sold ten 58/57 instead \ud83d\ude14. With AAPL, I think you're playing it close with the 185c too, but I'll be rooting for you! MS under 100.. when did you open your short calendars? You're playing it like how I do with my weeklies, but if you opened short calendars on those, then the price should've moved away from your strike more...? \ud83d\ude05 idk, you probably know your trade better than me", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks. I think when I opened up my put trade on SHOP there was nothing between 60 and 55 so that\u2019s why I picked those. Yep I like financials a lot lately but COF seems to have hit a lot of resistance lately around 142-143. Re the calendars my cost basis is very little on most of these because the short paid for 50% of the long cost and sometimes I\u2019ll sell another short less than 30 days away. I\u2019m opening these up at least 2-3 months out so they have time to move up. For MS I\u2019ve sold them more than once so I\u2019m sitting on 10 contracts June 21 longs with zero cost. Worse case scenario is I\u2019ll sell 4 or 5 to cover the shorts and I\u2019ll most likely ride the rest to expiration. For AAPL I had a bunch of different ones much higher and I sold them to get to the 185 when AAPL was at 170. The spreads on the calendars goes up as it gets close to the strike so they are still profitable. If the shorts expire worthless just under the strike then it\u2019s perfect so I\u2019ll see how it goes. Other calendars I have are Fang at 220, MSFT at 435, COF at 150, AAPL at 200 all several months out. Good luck this week!
