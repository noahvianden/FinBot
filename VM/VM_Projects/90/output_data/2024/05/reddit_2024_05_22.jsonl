First, there is a small chance that your shares could be called away any day. It's not at all likely, but it exists. \n\nI've owned my current Apple shares since Q3 of last year. I continually sell the weekly options against the shares. Right now, I own 600 shares and I'm short the 180 calls expiring this Friday, May 24. The daily time decay is around $60. I have an order to roll the 180 calls up to 185 and from this week to next, paying $4.65 per share to do this. \n\nWhy?   \n\nI want to own AAPL permanently, and also permanently rent out the shares by selling calls. I focus on the daily time decay because that is cash flow into my business. When the roll is done, I will have the potential to make 35 cents over the next week (The difference between 4.65 and 5). So, for a month, that's 0.35 x 4, or $1.40 per share. That's about 3/4 of a percent, per month. Not great, but at fairly low risk when AAPL is at $193 and I'm short the 185 calls. \n\nBut I don't stop there. If AAPL stays above my strike, then the next week I will roll the 185's up again to maybe 190, maybe 187, or something else. Each time I get closer to the ATM option, my daily time decay will increase because my level of protection will decrease. \n\nIt's all about risk management of the entire portfolio and the cash flow created by continually selling options. I track the total Delta of my portfolio as Beta Weighted to the DIA, and I track the daily Theta of my portfolio against my business plan for daily cash flow.\n\nThis approach is mine. It may not be right for everyone, but it works for me. This is the greatest thing about trading options - you can build any structure that your creative brain can envision - and you can use options to fine-tune your risk as you desire.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "I love this strategy of staying atm and rolling weekly.

But I'm selling a new one and creating the \"potential\" for increasing the value of my position. I think the problem is that you are only thinking about one transaction as an isolated event and I'm thinking about an endless stream of option selling. It's about cash flow over a year, not any one position. After I wrote that, I did get my order filled and now I have the shares with a covered call at 185 expiring next week. The time decay is now about $50 a day. So, I look at that as $50 x 365 days, or $18,250 that I will collect over the next year from these option sales. That's my THEORETICAL cash flow on the endless covered call. Realistically, it will probably be less than that. \n\nI have many covered call positions that are generating daily cash flow. I have, as you put it, no way of locking in any profits. But my cash flow is going to be great and won't end. Let's say I don't actually make any taxable profit over the next year with my AAPL covered calls because the stock price drops by a lot. I still get to keep the $18,000 and buy something else with that. It's a very long-term plan. I don't care about short term results. \n\nAnother way to think about is that each one of my stock positions is a rental house. As long as I can keep that house rented, I'm not really concerned that the house may be worth more one year and less the next year. I still get to collect and spend the rent. Over the long term my house will increase in value and eventually I will sell it.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "thank you for this!
