{"title": "5 Traits of Companies that have Outperformed", "selftext": "1. Lower Debt Levels\n\nThe world is uncertain and when things go against you, debt magnifies the negative. Of course it can magnify good things as well, but the data reviewed suggests that the best performers get their without high levels of debt.\n\n2. Higher Growth on a Per Share Basis\n\nIn things like sales, operating cash flow and free cash flows. The per share component is critical because growth at all costs (especially diluting shareholders) hurts performance\n\n3. Higher Gross Margins\n\nHigh gross margins suggest that the company can create something of significant value in excess of competition. For a product company, the inputs to make say a cell phone are all more or less the same, being able to sell far in excess of those same ingredients is an indication of pricing power.\n\n4. Operate in a Capital Efficient Manner\n\nThis helps to ensure low dilution and low debt hold over time. To model this I used Gross Profits / Operating Assets. Operating assets are defined as Total Assets - market investments. \n\n5. Sell at a reasonable Price\n\nEven if you meet the criteria of the other 4 to a high degree, the company is not worth an infinite price. I ranked companies by their Gross Profits / Market Cap.\n\n\nI then plugged this information into Portfolio123. This is back testing software that makes adjustments for when financial data was released (in other words no look ahead bias). I then ranked companies that are part of the Russell 1000 into 10 groups. Higher ranked companies meet more of the criteria mentioned and lesser ranked companies do not meet the conditions mentioned.\n\nThe results: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10UJ3-oVJVzDbh4Xclsfdrs9fbPk-TvM6u1nrK6dBxF4/edit\n\nOther Notes: All data above looks at past financial data that would have been available at the time.\n\nWhy the focus on Gross vs Net Profits? As mentioned, in my view Gross profits may indicate pricing power. Also when dealing with financials in bulk as you move down the income statement the data can get more noisy. For example in the last few years, gains and losses are required to -ass through the income statement even though it doesn\u2019t make economic sense (you can look up the values of these securities on the balance sheet). Also I realized companies make trade offs farther down the income statement that are neither good nor bad but could be screened out if we only looked at operating or net profits. For example for 2 decades AMZN and CRM purposefully invested aggressively and never showed gains in profits despite a torrid growth pace. This was ultimately wise as they gobbled up more market share. Only recently (particularly for CRM) have profits started as revenue growth has slowed and les investment is needed. \n\nI hope you found this useful!", "id": "18w3pwn", "created_utc": 1704135652.0, "score": 105, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "It seems obvious that low debt and high margins operating efficiently, while generating free cash flow will lead to good performance.", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "But it's really not obvious - most people in this sub buy stocks because the way the stock ticker has/is moving, or they just buy based on the brand, and they have no idea what they're paying for it (and don't care).\n\nA lot of people invest in companies like MSFT, TSLA, NVDA as if it were an ETF.
