{"title": "How do people manage to wipe out their accounts? Or am I just being delusional", "selftext": "I\u2019m sorry but I just don\u2019t see it. I just don\u2019t see how you can be that dumb. Like I wanna know for my self if people are just dumb or if I\u2019m being delusional. I\u2019m not trying to be mean but come on. I\u2019m a VERY emotional person. I got scammed 5k and nearly lost my mind. People are scared to trade because of the stupidity they hear about trading and how it\u2019s so hard and they lost all this money in not even in 5 years, in ONE year. How can you be that dumb ? Like fine your 40k is now 10kafter 4 years of experience, but how the HELL did you manage to do that in 1 year?\n\n\nBut seriously, what causes that? The way I\u2019m thinking, is \n\n1. Pick decent stocks, not risky penny stocks or stupid shit like that\n\n2. Take decent profits and don\u2019t push it (unless you are investing longer than a year in a reputable company)\n\n3. Diversify your portfolio\n\n4. Trade based on your capital (if your capital is $10k, don\u2019t put fucking $6k in one stock you barely have any room for the 2% limit if it goes down)\n\n5. Know when to actually sell a stock so if you can risk 200 on a trade, don\u2019t just suddenly freak out and sell all your stocks when they are all $100 down. Maybe the market is down\n\n6. Play around and risk very little at first to get used to the market\n\n7. Get something some kind of software that analyzes stocks and recommends stocks\n\n8. Fucking control your emotions. Which is why you trade with very little at first. You won\u2019t freak out being $5 down but you will when you\u2019re $500. \n\n9. Don\u2019t ever be an idiot and gamble. If you\u2019re gambling with stocks, then accept the fact that you\u2019re gambling, not trading so you won\u2019t be mad when you lose all your money\n\n10. Stop thinking you can turn this into a full time job in a couple weeks. Start with small profits as a side hustle\n\nYeah there\u2019s technical analysis and all, which you should learn as you trade. But realistically, if you just shut the fuck to for a couple minutes and thought realistically, you\u2019d be fine. SO many stocks can make you money. But you choose to be risky and emotional. Don\u2019t just sell right away at any loss. But also, accept when you just have to take a loss instead of holding on to hope and risking more. And don\u2019t risk and gamble. And take profits, even small ones. Stop expecting to double you\u2019re $1000 and start taking 5% $50 profits because with the little knowledge you have, you\u2019ll get excited, and be scared to sell, then it\u2019ll crash and you\u2019ll lose your money. Now imagine if you just sold at 5% and made your $50 on every trade!\n\nSuccessful people focus on minimizing losses, not chasing gains at least at first. \n\nAlso I\u2019m an idiot who\u2019s still learning. Right when I start feeling cocky, I humble myself because it\u2019s embarrassing to be all cocky then lose a ton of money the next day. I guess I made this post for my self. To give my self hope. Im sick of hearing how trading is soooooo hard when in reality people freak out and turn their 50k to 5k In a year. Now if you minimized your losses, maybe you would\u2019ve lost 5k and learned something.\n\nOh and don\u2019t day trade thinking you can become a day trader and make $100 a day in a couple weeks . THAT is hard. Maybe, be more realistic with the stock market?
