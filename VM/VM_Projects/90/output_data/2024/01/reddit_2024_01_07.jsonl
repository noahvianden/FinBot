{"title": "Apple: Why The iPhone 16 Could Be A Breakthrough Platform For AI On The Edge", "selftext": "TL;DR: Apple engineers have recently demonstrated the ability to run large language models (LLMs) on small end devices using flash memory, offering a potential solution to the limitations of DRAM. Apple's next generation of devices, and the iPhone in particular, could be breakthrough platforms for AI on the edge. Apple's lead in chip technology could put it at the forefront of a potential revolution in AI hardware. This would be the foundation for a unique ecosystem of AI apps for Apple devices.\n\nThe full text can be found [here](https://chaotropy.medium.com/apple-why-the-iphone-16-could-be-a-breakthrough-platform-for-ai-on-the-edge-33bb262033ef)  or [here](https://www.chaotropy.com/apple-why-the-iphone-16-could-be-a-breakthrough-platform-for-ai-on-the-edge/).   \n\n\nThis is the author's opinion only, not financial advice, and is intended for entertainment purposes only. The author holds a beneficial long position in Apple Inc.\n\n\n\"Apple still makes its money by selling end devices. So why should Apple watch its end devices become mere middlemen for its competitors' cloud-based AI solutions? As far as I know, there are no signs that Apple will suddenly enter the cloud AI race with Open AI's ChatGPT or Google Bard. I think Apple is planning something else, and there are the first concrete signs of it: starting with the iPhone, Apple's products could become platforms for running LLMs on the edge. In December 2023, Apple engineers published a [groundbreaking paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11514) showing that large LLMs can be run on the flash memory of an end device (such as an iPhone), bypassing the problem of limited DRAM on the edge. Flash memory has about an order of magnitude higher storage capacity than DRAM, making it possible to run even large LLMs on small end devices. Also in December 2023, Apple released its own open source AI framework, [MLX](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx), which is optimized for Apple's silicon chip architecture. App developers can already use it to write their own machine learning applications on Apple silicon. Earlier, in October 2023, Apple engineers unveiled their own [multimodal LLM Ferret](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07704v1), which has since been [released as open source](https://github.com/apple/ml-ferret) as well. Every new powerful open source LLM ultimately attacks the market position of commercial LLMs. With the M1-M3 generations, Apple has developed cutting-edge processor technology and has been a leading chip developer for years. For now, AI appears to be primarily a software revolution. Given the similar performance of OpenAI's GPT-3.5, xAI's Grok, the open source model Mixtral, and Google's Gemini Pro, as well as the reported similar performance of OpenAI's GPT 4.0 and Google's Gemini Ultra, there is already a suspicion that we are not so far away from the maximum possible performance of the new LLMs - some call it [Peak AI](https://www.businessinsider.com/generative-ai-chatgpt-getting-close-peak-2023-12?r=US&IR=T). Perhaps the next quantum leap in AI will be preceded by a revolution in computer chips - in which case Apple, as a leading chip designer, would suddenly be at the forefront. And when it comes to implementing and applying such AI models, let's not forget that Apple's devices are already packed with all kinds of sensors that generate a constant stream of data for locally executed AI.\n\nSo do we really want to believe that the world's most highly capitalized company is sleeping through the AI revolution and thinks it can continue to satisfy its customers with annual \"lackluster\" updates to high-priced devices? I doubt that Apple is simply relying on its product ecosystem to keep its customers. A new generation of iPhones and other devices capable of efficiently running AI on the edge would be the foundation for an ecosystem of new Apple and third-party apps that only Apple device owners would have access to - a Buffetian economic moat par excellence.
