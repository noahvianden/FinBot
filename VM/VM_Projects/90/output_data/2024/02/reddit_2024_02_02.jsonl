Meta keeps getting touted as this stock that dropped purely on doomer talk, but the reality is the financials and outlook were terrible at the time and the drop was completely warranted. Hindsight is always 20/20, but take a look at what was actually happening when it fell. Q2, Q3 and Q4 of 2022 were the first time in history Meta saw revenue shrink YoY, and it literally happened 3 earnings in a row. Net income also got chopped by more than 50%, from ~$10B per quarter in 2021 down to $4.5B per quarter in the bottom of 2022.\n\nThat\u2019s a brutal year for a high flying tech stock. And financial outlook through most of 2022 was incredibly bearish as well. Apple\u2019s new privacy features destroyed Meta\u2019s ability to collect user data as easily, and TikTok was solidifying itself as an app that the younger generation was using more than Instagram. As a result, the stock price dropped back to earth. If it hadn\u2019t then the company would\u2019ve had a PE of ~50, which again is just ridiculous to pay for a stock that has shrinking revenue, margins, and profit. \n\nAs they\u2019ve continued to put out good ERs over the past year, the stock has been steadily rising. That\u2019s just the nature of the market. I don\u2019t think there was \u201cobvious\u201d signs they were going to pivot so successfully. Most people commenting as such just got lucky and like to boast. Look at stocks like PayPal or Alibaba as what could\u2019ve happened to Meta. Just years and years of declining price even despite the underlying fundamentals improving. Very few ppl will ever agree with that sentiment though. It\u2019s far easier to just bash stocks as they\u2019re falling and praise them as they\u2019re rising and never make predictions.

If you\u2019re a long term investor it was just noise, but in the short term it was horrific.\n\nI\u2019m not sure which margin you\u2019re talking about, as their operating margin plummeted from 40% in 2021 to 25% in 2022. And their profit margin fell from 35% to 20%. The economy was growing while revenue was shrinking and Zuck stopped issuing forward guidance so investors had no idea how long they\u2019d be in a rut.
