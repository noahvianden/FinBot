{"title": "FTC sues to block Kroger, Albertsons merger over price and wage concerns", "selftext": "The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said Monday that it is suing to block the merger of Kroger and Albertsons, saying the combination of the two major grocers would result in higher prices for shoppers and lower wages for workers.\n\nIn a release, the FTC said it issued an administrative complaint and authorized a lawsuit in federal court to stop Kroger\u2019s $24.6 billion acquisition of Albertsons, which would create one of the largest grocers in the country. A bipartisan group of nine attorneys general have joined the court complaint, including those from Arizona, California, Washington D.C., Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming.\n\n\u201cKroger\u2019s acquisition of Albertsons would lead to additional grocery price hikes for everyday goods, further exacerbating the financial strain consumers across the country face today,\u201d said Henry Liu, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Competition. \u201cEssential grocery store workers would also suffer under this deal, facing the threat of their wages dwindling, benefits diminishing, and their working conditions deteriorating.\u201d\n\nKroger said in a statement that blocking the deal \u201cwill actually harm the very people the FTC purports to serve: America\u2019s consumers and workers.\u201d\n\n \u201cThe FTC\u2019s decision makes it more likely that America\u2019s consumers will see higher food prices and fewer grocery stores at a time when communities across the country are already facing high inflation and food deserts,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nIt added that the decision \u201cstrengthens larger, non-unionized retailers like Walmart, Costco and Amazon by allowing them to further increase their overwhelming and growing dominance of the grocery industry.\u201d\n\nKroger and Albertsons\u2019 agreement has been stuck in a holding pattern for more than a year while federal and state regulators scrutinize the merger. The companies announced the proposed deal in October 2022, and said by teaming up, the grocers would be able to better compete with larger retailers like Walmart, Amazon and Costco.\n\nThe FTC argued the supermarket merger would harm shoppers and workers at a time when the price of food and many everyday items has risen. The Biden administration has been skeptical of a range of mergers, and the White House has made consumer protection a key issue as President Joe Biden campaigns for reelection this fall.\n\nKroger CEO Rodney McMullen has made the company\u2019s case for the tie-up, saying as a larger supermarket operator, the combined companies would be able to lower prices, boost profitability and speed up innovation in the grocery industry. The company also pledged $500 million to reduce prices for customers and $1 billion to raise employee wages and expand benefits.\n\nYet the deal has faced stiff resistance and new complications after a period of historic inflation. Two unions that represent Kroger and Albertsons employees, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and the Teamsters union, opposed the deal.\n\nHigher prices of everyday food items fueled worries that a bigger company would have too much pricing power \u2014 concerns some politicians have echoed.\n\nHigher grocery prices have irked consumers and become a hot topic on the campaign trail. Earlier this month, grocery chains drew the ire of Biden, who accused companies of ripping off shoppers while keeping profit margins high.\n\nTogether, Kroger and Albertsons would be a mammoth company and tighten a market share gap with Walmart, the largest grocer in the U.S. Kroger and Albertsons also compete with regional players like Publix and Wegmans, and discounters like Aldi and Trader Joe\u2019s.\n\nCombined, the grocers would have about 5,000 stores across the U.S. The deal would marry Kroger\u2019s approximately two dozen supermarket banners, including its namesake stores, Fred Meyer, and Ralphs with Albertsons\u2019 grocery chains, including Safeway, Acme and Tom Thumb.\n\nIn an effort to overcome antitrust concerns, Kroger announced last year that it planned to sell more than 400 stores to Piggly Wiggly owner C&S Wholesale Grocers, along with other assets like distribution centers and some private brands.\n\nBut the FTC complaint said that the proposed divestiture isn\u2019t enough. It would create \u201ca hodgepodge of unconnected stores, banners, brands and other assets\u201d that wouldn\u2019t be a true rival to the combined Kroger and Albertsons, the federal agency said in a release Monday.\n\nThe FTC contended the combined Kroger and Albertsons would have less reason to improve the customer experience. The federal agency said competition between the supermarkets has contributed to fresher produce, better private label offerings and services that shoppers appreciate, such as flexible pharmacy hours and curbside pickup.\n\nThe FTC also argued the deal would leave workers with less negotiating power, since employees wouldn\u2019t have as many potential grocery employers. In some markets like Denver, the combined supermarket operator would be the only employer of unionized grocery workers, the agency said.\n\nAs some news outlets reported last week that the FTC would soon sue to block the merger, a Kroger spokeswoman said the company was still in discussions with FTC and state regulators.\n\nThe company reiterated its argument that the merger would benefit grocery shoppers and workers.\n\n\u201cBlocking the combination will only embolden large, non-unionized retailers \u2013 like Walmart, Amazon and Costco \u2013 to continue opposing unions and leaving communities,\u201d the company said in a statement last week. \u201cKroger will continue to lower prices, grow good-paying union jobs and increase access to fresh food for the families who need it most.\u201d\n\nKroger shares were trading about 1% lower Monday afternoon, while Albertsons stock was slightly higher.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/26/ftc-sues-to-block-kroger-albertsons-grocery-store-merger.html", "id": "1b0n2q0", "created_utc": 1708968196.0, "score": 392, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": ">speed up innovation in the grocery industry\n\nWhat does this even mean?", "score": 19, "replies": [{"body": "\u201cFigure out how to pay workers less and make more money\u201d", "score": 23, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11923350393772125}, {"body": "Invention of fixed prices", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19939880073070526}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.44605928659439087}, {"body": "Whatever happened to the anti-trust laws?", "score": 84, "replies": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "Aided by corporate lobbyists successfully implanting the \"all regulation is job-killing red tape\" myth.", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07419072836637497}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": -16, "replies": [{"body": "The DOJ anti-trust division has less employees today than it did in 1980.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": ">The DOJ anti-trust division has less employees today than it did in 1980.\n\n...\"fewer,\" Webster - and the correct number of business-and-job-killing regulatory employees is 0...", "score": -9, "replies": [{"body": "TIL Charles Koch is on reddit.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1648290753364563}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8143777847290039}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08271380513906479}, {"body": "Perfect illustration of the problem, but not in the way you think.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.089690662920475}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0000001192092896}, {"body": "Law and order*\n\nDoes not apply to rich people, drivers, or corporations.", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08411434292793274}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11845510452985764}, {"body": "whenever i look at my kroger/ralphs and albertsons/vons weekly ads, ralphs consistently has the higher prices.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2429901361465454}, {"body": "That's what this article is about, isn't it?\n\nThe merger needs to clear regulatory hurdles.

This merger would expand them nationally and give them better bargaining power with their suppliers, which in turn either translates to better prices, better stock price or both.\n\nThere's many chains beneath both Kroger and Albertsons, and different chains have different pricing structures, quality levels, etc., so complaing about a \"lack of selection\" where you live is BS.  If you live in a food desert complain to your representatives, not the grocery store. There's still Publix, Wegmans, IGA stores, etc.\n\nPrices went up due to covid supply chain issues, prices stayed up because the \"fight for $15/hr\" went into effect as supply chains started to normalize.

Of course not, but when your labor costs DOUBLE, you have to maintian profitabilty somehow.\n\nRemember when local Mom n' Pop stores were up in arms because Walmart was expanding everywhere and forcing them out of business because they couldn't compete with Walmart's buying power and lower pricing? Why would you think that a Kroger/Albertsons merger wouldn't go the same direction? \n\nPrices wouldn't go higher because of it. At best they would stay the same or go lower.
