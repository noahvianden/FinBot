{"title": "Disney (DIS) Analysis", "selftext": "For the next analysis we will be looking at Walt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) earnings. This company is a staple of American culture but has struggled tremendously in recent years due to Covid-19 and more recently adjusting to the direction of the industry in terms of streaming. The company released Disney+ to compete with the likes of Netflix and others. Many analysts are expecting the company to perform well with their theme parks, but many question marks remain on the profitability and viability of the streaming service they offer. Disney will report earnings after the bell on February 7th with the earnings call to follow. Guidance will be incredibly important with this report, as will streaming numbers. With that being said, let\u2019s dive into the analysis and see where the stock could potentially head post earnings and in the future.\n\nDescription: \n\nWalt Disney Co (NYSE: DIS) is an American media conglomerate that acts as an umbrella for many household names like Disney, Pixar, ESPN, and 20th Century Studios. The company has recently developed the Disney+ streaming service to compete with companies like Netflix and develop a more thorough revenue stream. The company is plagued with many issues, from performing poorly in the box office to losing money with their streaming service. However, there should be positive information about ESPN+ which is also owned by Disney and showcases many sports, particularly the NFL so I expect this to be a big positive as well. This quarter Disney hopes to report increased performance within their theme parks, increasing subscriber numbers within Disney+, and a reduction in the operating loss of the business. Earlier this year the company went through a round of layoffs where 7,000 jobs were cut in hopes of reducing costs. We hope to see those cost reductions acting positively and increasing the efficiency of the business. The strong sentiment on Wall Street is that the company is considered a buy, which could certainly be the case if the company manages to overcome a poor quarter in the box office and calm the worries of many with their guidance. \n\nFinancial Breakdown:\n\nLTM Price Increase: $111.63 \u2013 $99.29 (-11.05%)\nSubscribers: 150.2 Million Subscribers (+2.38% Q3)\nRevenue increase: +5% YoY Q3 and +29% YTD 2023\nCompetitors: Netflix (NFLX), Sony (SONY), Fox Corporation (FOX)\n\nEarnings:\n\nQ3 Reported EPS: $0.82 (+15.11% delta from expected) | Q3 Reported Revenue: $21.24B (-0.79% delta)\n\nStock Move: Stock jumped 6.91% after earnings\n\nQ4 Expected EPS: $1.04 | Q4 Expected Revenue: $23.77B\n\nVerdict: \n\nWith Disney reporting earnings after market close on February 7th, it will be difficult to find an easy play because of the uncertainty, along with potential opportunities present within the company. Theme parks will most likely be a strong positive, with more individuals visiting this winter quarter particularly during school breaks. Several eyewitness reports suggest it was \u201cunprecedently crowded this year\u201d. This, along with the effects of earlier layoffs should hopefully slim down the company and reduce their operating losses. But, despite all the potential positives major threats also exist in the likes of Disney+ performance. If streaming numbers come in lower than expected, or guidance is viewed as negative for the rest of the year, the stock price will get pummeled no matter how successful the theme parks were. The lack of box office films also poses a threat this quarter. Several flops could put a damper on the earnings report. Next up, my opinion on how this company will fare this quarter. \n\nPrior to providing my opinion, I must preface with a disclosure that options trading is extremely risky and losing all your money is a very real possibility and that this is not financial advice. Whether you elect to agree with my personal decision is entirely up to you, and this post is simply intended to provide more information into the company. Looking at this earnings report, I understand the concern of where the company is heading due to a lack of box office production in recent quarters. However, I think the combination of theme parks, layoffs, and improved guidance for 2024 will make the stock pop ~7% or so to a price of about $105.00. Looking at the contracts available, I did not purchase too many calls due to the uncertainty present and better opportunities in the market. However, I did pick up 3 $100 Calls expiring February 9th in anticipation of a potential bounce IF AND ONLY IF subscription numbers come in better than expected and guidance is positive. It won\u2019t matter how good earnings are if numbers or guidance disappoints. Overall, this play is very risky but I think the positives outweigh the negatives making me lean toward an increase post earnings. \n\nWe have a few more earnings to play this week (PYPL, PINS, etc.), so expect to see more posts like this one. Please leave a like and comment if you want to see more. Good luck!\n\nEDIT: Watch for the potential impacts of boycotts affecting the companies earnings this quarter, ranging from their stance on the Middle East to being woke ", "id": "1al4tvg", "created_utc": 1707317909.0, "score": 43, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|4|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|451|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2969861328601837}, {"body": "Alright, looking at this guy's past analyses:\n\n|Stock|Recommendation|Result|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|LLY|$700 02/09 Call|\ud83d\udcb5|\n|SNAP|$17.50 02/09 Call *(OP notes he did not buy)*|\u274c|\n|F|$12 02/09 Call|\ud83d\udcb5|\n|DIS|$100 02/09 Call|\ud83d\udcb5|\n|PYPL|$64 02/09 Call|\u274c|\n\n**Conclusion:** Stocks only go up (unless they are Snapchat).", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "I stayed on the sideline for Snapchat, didn\u2019t like the volatility", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "You on the sideline for this one two.

A consolidation is probable, but in 2025 or 2026 at the earliest. \nThere might be singular non-standard events that push their stock up, but the overall trend seems to be \"down\", for the moment, because Disney's  over-the-counter revenue seems poised to shrink. \n\nWhether Disney's merch revenue goes up again largely seems to depend on two conventionally \"gettable\" challenges: Copyright practice (English?) and brand value. \nCopyright is a challenge because there is going to be a stronger and stronger pull towards more brands getting Steamboat Willie'd, which means that classic Disney-based merchandising is increasingly going to be offered by third-party producers. \nBrand value is a challenge because all of Disney's mothership brands (Marvel, Star Wars, Pirates, etc.) are *perceived* as \"failing\". New releases might well lead to occasional upticks in, say, premium content/streaming subscriptions.
