AMZ: $165c @ $2.94 META: $440c @ $0.80 I see they both are in pending state even though the orders show placed. Also my contracts are showing Buy to open. I tried to understand this but can't wrap my head around it. What does this mean. Does it mean my order hasn't been executed? How can I sell this contract or whatever it is I need to do to profit from it (is applicable) Any insights will be great!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1wyuyl3c28gc1.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b1c77ce339ab51bb46c62bed1212dcbbdbebab6", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "you never bought them, you placed an order for them that didn\u2019t get filled\u2026\n\nfucking A man you missed out on thousands smfh", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3986356854438782}], "tickers": ["meta"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Nice on that Meta call.
