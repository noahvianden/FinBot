{"title": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) $171 A good long term buy", "selftext": "\\#AMD\u2019s MI300 chips will be its growth engine for the future and the key reason for buying this stock. While I don\u2019t believe it will get close to Nvidia\u2019s near monopolistic market share of 80% there is ample room for more competitors and AMD will benefit from the AI boom as well.  \nIt recently upped its guidance for 2024 for artificial intelligence-related revenue to $3.5B up from $2B previously.\n\n$AMD Chief Executive Dr. Lisa Su said she had \"good confidence\" the company will be able to exceed the $3.5B figure this year and the $1.5B run-rate for the coming fourth-quarter. $1.5Bn run rate implies $6Bn in annual sales.  \nHowever, based on Citi analyst estimates, AMD is likely to generate $5B this year and $8B next year from the MI300 - they believe that Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) are the largest customers for the MI300, which was unveiled in December to much fanfare. And with the average selling price at roughly $10,000 for Microsoft and $15,000 or more for other customers, it's possible AMD is purposefully underestimating sales figures, possibly on supply concerns?  \nFor Q4-2023 AMD results were in line with expectations  \nEPS: $0.77 per share, adjusted, versus $0.77 per share expected  \nRevenue: $6.17 billion, versus $6.12 billion expected  \nData Center revenue $2.28Bn in line V $2.29 expected.  \nGuidance was light:  \nQ1-24 $5.4Bn in sales, plus or minus $300 million, V $5.73 Bn expected.  \nFlat data center revenue with server chip declines to be offset by AI GPU sales. We saw weak data center revenue from Intel, this is definitely some cannibalization and likely to continue, till AI GPU starts taking a larger share of the pie.  \nClient Group - The recovery in PC\u2019s helped AMD\u2019s client group, which rose 62% year-over-year to $1.46 billion in sales, which the company said was boosted by recent chip launches.  \nGaming, which includes \u201csemi-custom\u201d processors for Microsoft Xbox and Sony Playstation consoles, fell 17%. AMD blamed slower console sales, and said it expected semi-custom revenue to decline by a \u201csignificant\u201d double-digit percentage in the current quarter. This is a low margin business and drags AMD\u2019s overall margins.  \nAMD\u2019s embedded segment, which includes chips for networking, reported $1.1 billion in sales, down 24% on an annual basis.", "id": "1anrsxh", "created_utc": 1707602925.0, "score": 256, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "Remember buying at 10 and selling at 14.

Even if they were bringing in the money that analysts expect in 2025 and 2026, it still wouldn't justify its current valuation.

Problem with your reasoning here is that you aren't considering that AMD is selling them at a damn near breakeven point just to get market share. So while it's a better \"value\" to the purchaser, it's a significantly worse revenue stream for AMD than the H100 is for Nvidia. It's not even in the same league as the H100 when it comes to profit. Nvidia leads in every metric of business and brings in exponentially more revenue than AMD does.

I agree that there is marginally more competition now, but AMD competes on hardware merits. They have more memory, but CUDA is anchoring companies to the NVIDIA line.  \n\nTrue, but even Nvidia recognizes that the moat around CUDA isn't sustainable with so many players in the hunt for a piece of the pie. There's a large sweeping movement for open source alternatives and even Nvidia is working on them. The AI hype is ridiculous, but there's no denying that it's extremely lucrative. Everyone is willing to do just about anything to unseat Nvidia, up to and including teaming up with one another.\n\n> Fab constrained, and I get the sense that the market has completely written off geopolitical concerns with China/Taiwan. \n\nThe geopolitical influences are still there, but with world governments taking precautions in case of a Taiwan invasion, its less at the forefront than it was.  TSMC's Fab 18 is currently operational and handles fabbing on both 3nm to 5nm (and the N4X that the H100 is built on if I'm not mistaken). Arizona, IIRC, will be 3nm-4nm and will be late 2025, providing there aren't any more delays.Their first 2nm fab in Taiwan isn't expected to come online until late 2025, and the other in 2026. So for the next ~2 years, TSMC will be on 3nm. Enter Intel, who just started risk production on 18A and leapfrogged the shit out of them. They're already working on 14A as well.\n\n> Can you tell me a bit about your thought process on the product canibalizing point? I don\u2019t really see NVIDIA as having a problem moving products. I think they have the lowest risk of obsolete inventory ending up on their books. \n\nMoving products, no. They already sell what limited supply they have to the first buyer willing to write a blank check. I say it'll cannibalize sales because the newer product will be in higher demand, and the older product won't be able to command the same premium. The H100 is built on TSMC 4nm, and the B100 will be on 3nm. Until Nvidia phases out the H100 and TSMC has a chance to retool that fab, they'll have a split capacity between two products. That's what I was getting at.\n\n> That\u2019s an interesting point, they do have most of the market share now. Can they grow that any more? Even if not the overall market will grow to a certain extent, but how much of it will they retain moving forward?\n\nI see this going one of two ways. First, they stay far enough ahead of the competition to keep the status quo. Theyll need to expand into different market segments to continue growing, though. But, IMO, the most likely scenario is similar to what happened with Tesla. They were only dominant while there was no competition. Then, a handful of competitors enter the market and now they're buckling under the pressure. No one company can have a monopoly for very long on THIS lucrative of a business. The more viable competition there is, the more their sales figures and profit margins go down sharply. CUDA isn't going to be a moat forever.\n\n\n> Keep in mind they\u2019re rumoured to be launching the H200 soon. \n\nIndeed, though from what ive read the biggest improvement on the H200 is the doubling of the HBM memory and memory bandwidth. Time will tell how much this actually affects performance.\n\n> INTC is so undervalued! \nCreating a stable supply chain for chips has become a priority since the pandemic. J Powell cites the semiconductor supply chain shock as a primary source of inflation from the pandemic in his 60 mins interview.\n\nThat's exactly what I'm banking on. They've already been awarded the DoD contract. They're the only company that meets the government's requirements. So if they're really serious about ending the dependency on foreign markets, they'll be entirely dependent on Intel.\n\nThey won't get rich on the military contract, but it does ensure that their fab expansion is profitable and has a steady revenue stream. I definitely agree that Intel is *very* undervalued. The upside potential is insane.\n\n> Hyperscalers do seem like a threat, have you done much research on the in house chips META, GOOGLE, and AMAZON are developing?\n\nI haven't done a ton of research on it either. I know Google and Intel are collaborating on a server security solution, and that Googles recent chip was based on Intel Xeon. But beyond that, I don't know much. Now that you mention it, though, I'll do some digging and see what I can find.\n\n> AMD\u2019s R&D costs are getting massive, they\u2019re putting a lot of resources into winning the AI race. I wonder if this a pursuit that will hurt their free cash flow in the long run. Probably not, they issue shares as compensation to fund R&D, so how long before they dilute away their value? Can they take market share before they erode their value. That was one of my concerns before I sold my position in AMD. I don\u2019t trust Lisa Su either, she\u2019s a salesperson. Knowledgeable, but dodgey imo. \n\nThus far, AMD's idea of R&D is to just buy a company that's already done the research for them. The problem is, this strategy really only works to catch up. At some point, they're going to have to increase their R&D budget. But in order to do that, they need to significantly increase their profit margin. This path isn't sustainable, nor is diluting the shares over and over again for more acquisitions. This is the biggest reason why I won't buy AMD stock. Instead of investing in their future, they're propping up their financials to boost their stock prices.\n\n> Hey I\u2019ve appreciated hearing your view on things Mr. Vette, thanks.
