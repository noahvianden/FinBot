{"title": "Is Boeing the world's biggest deep value play?", "selftext": "For those who don't know the story, Boeing is a giant soulless company with branches all over and does all work aerospace but is best known for their jumbojets. Years ago while designing the 737 MAX their sales team talked to the customer. The customer said they would be buying planes by X date and did not care whether it came from them or competition. They also wanted all the modern bells and whistles but wanted it cross compatible with earlier planes so they didn't need to retrain pilots and mechanics. The sales team who are not engineers or machinists and were on the opposite side of the country as those men said sure thing to all of it and the design team did their best to fill it all.\n\nIf any one of the hurdles was lifted (deadlines, cross compatible, modernized) there wouldn't have been an issue because Boeing's new and improved safety critical system did not function like the pilots thought it did, causing two crashes.\n\nNo criminal charges were filed, obviously, as no one person was negligent. But Boeing paid record breaking fines in the billions, fines greater than the market caps of most aviation firms. The stock tanked accordingly and recovered over time.\n\nHowever, the 737 MAX is CURSED, I tell you!!! This year a plug in the fuselage randomly exploded on takeoff, but fortunately the pilots landed safely. The fault is not yet known. The machanics at Alaska Airlines said they found many slightly loose bolts on other planes so perhaps this was operator error. The Boeing factory found minor quality control issues with two hole sizes that required reworks but were not a safety issue. However, this particular part was outsourced to a third world country, which doesn't surprise (most aerospace firms know better than to do that).\n\nAlso, Boeing's employees want a raise. That ain't happening when they are already losing money this year.\n\nHowever, one should note that the stock is stupidly cheap. Ignoring the negative P/E ratio and the fact their debt value exceeds their current market cap, they seem to be trading below their liquidation value. They have near 80 billion in inventory alone (spare parts, presold planes, service contracts in progress), and I can't find any estimate for the value of their factories buy it is a capital intensive business involving thousands of expensive robots.\n\nOf course they ain't liquidating or getting bought out, they're too big for that even if some assets may be sold off or shares diluted.\n\nMany customers physically cannot get rid of Boeing because contracts or they can't afford to be rid of the planes. Also, the 737 MAX is CURSED, but other planes have been good. They've also done a lot of work for NASA and the government mismanagement there has profited Boeing because in many contracts Boeing is sallaried and NASA is nothing but delays. Like mentioned earlier, buying new models for old planes makes things cheaper because no retraining and shared parts. Classic Buffet style economic moat keeping business within Boeing.\n\nThe real question is has the market correctly priced Boeing? The reason I think they haven't is simply down to all the hate mail they get. So many people refuse to hear anything nice about them so it is like a vice stock: Offerring better returns because active investors both rich and poor refuse to touch it. In markets, perceived junk is often treasure.\n\nAlso, the guys bullying Boeing online are the same guys who lost money on Tesla, and when they bought into that the company was not only losing money and had no moat, but was paying the boss lawsuit worthy amounts of stock options. Who is really buying junk?\n\nBoeing definitely isn't going to 10x, it's simply too big for that. But not if but when they report a profit in a few years the stock price will rise by a lot. All they need to do is keep making planes.
