Technical: the stock crossed $16.40 which is the 20 day average. It loves to spike prior to earnings if technicals show momentum. Added bonus: Also the stock can be a winner if the money from Tesla is looking for \u201cother\u201d EV play or diversifying. \n2. Sentimental: What I find truly unique about this brand that people really LOVE their trucks. That is very important and there is no other pure EV play except Tesla that may POTENT-rally turn into a success. We all know LCID and FSKR are dead. Rivian is a pure SUV play. Think of Range Rover of EV.\n3. Fundamental: The good thing is they have \ud83d\udcb0 cash. The demand is very strong but they need to streamline the production process. There are hopes the company can survive\u2026. Not going into much details, read yourself.\n\nWhy did I make such a bet? I am not gonna tell you why.\n\nThe Plan: I will decide whether to hold thru the earnings or not. If the price is $20 or more. I probably will hold through the ER. If $16-$18 then sell before earnings. Between $18-20 will play with houses money.\n\nAny other questions?", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "\u201cPlay with houses money\u201d means selling 77k worth of the options and just playing with the profit you have made till then?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Yes.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13394863903522491}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35264673829078674}, {"body": "plus R2 gets revealed March 7, and they just released cheaper options.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.286033034324646}, {"body": "GL, Ive been YOLOing this as well.
