This occurred to me recently when reading an \"analyst report\" re: a \"short-term buy signal\" re: some stock contrasted by a \"longer term\" sell signal: by short term, they meant 2-4 days, by \"longer term\", they meant 4-8 weeks!!! I was like, who gives a fnck about 4-8 weeks?!?!? I'm planning for retirement here! Might I have turned $100K into $1M in a relatively short time frame had I put it ALL into NVIDIA 1-2 years ago and day traded it back and forth ever since? Sure. But I don't have nearly enough capital to risk putting $100K into a single ETF, let alone single growth stock (I wouldn't even put that much into bonds alone). I imagine I'm not alone on that front here. For those of us who are just trying to generate some decent returns for ourselves so we won't end up homeless if/when we can't work anymore 10-30 years from now, stressing over short-term fluctuations is costing us time, energy, and emotional health. I think those of us in this camp need to decide--based on a meaningful but not obsessive amount of research--whether we think acquiring a given position (or adding or detracting from one) is more or less likely to yield decent returns over the longterm or not, act accordingly, and then just leave it be (save for adding to the position via some version of DCA) until (a) a black swan thing happens, (b) a reverse black swan thing happens, (c) it's time to rebalance, or (d) our personal circumstances change drastically (e.g., we win the lottery and have capital we can afford to play with, we get sick and need to draw down on investments sooner than expected, etc.). All I know is, I felt a lot more relaxed/able to focus on other things today after removing my brokerage app from my phone and logging out of the web platform.

I personally usually follow the RSI of a stock, anything above 70 and that means it's overbought, more demand than supply which drives the price up but there's so few shares being traded because everyone is holding for the long term, that eventually it corrects itself. It was trading around $1150 pre-split and just made its way back, once people started buying the dip it inevitably started to go back up. \n\nIf you buy at say $116 and never sell it could be years before you see any significant return, when in the same amount of time you could have multiplied your shares. Use apple for an example, they went from $195 to $160 back up to $195 down to $160 then shot to $215 in the last year, if you sold at $195 and bought the first dip you'd have been up 20% from your original position if you reinvested the profits and sold when it came back up. Then an additional 34% if you bought the second dip, and so on. \n\nIf you had just held Apple shares at let's say $140/share and bought October 2021 through the highs and lows you'd only be up 38% over 3 years if you sold on the recent ATH but would have made more than that this year alone buying dips and selling highs.   \n\nNVIDIA isn't going to be giving 1000% returns anymore and now is the time to ride the waves. If it drops 10-20% it usually reverses and gains twice as much. A drop from 140 to 116 is a 17% loss but 116 back to 140 is a 21% gain.

You'd have made 5x that at its current market value by selling at its target price and reinvesting on the dips.

{"title": "EU charges Microsoft with 'abusive' bundling of Teams and Office ", "selftext": "The European Union on Tuesday accused Microsoft of breaching antitrust rules with the \u201cabusive\u201d bundling of its Teams and Office products.\n\n\u201cThe European Commission has informed Microsoft of its preliminary view that Microsoft has breached EU antitrust rules by tying its communication and collaboration product Teams to its popular productivity applications included in its suites for businesses Office 365 and Microsoft 365,\u201d the European Commission \u2014 the EU\u2019s executive arm \u2014 said in a Statement of Objections, which is sent to inform companies of concerns raised against them.\n\nIf the Commission decides that an infringement has taken place once companies have responded, it can ban the conduct and fine the charged company up to 10% of its global revenue.\n\nMicrosoft took the pre-emptive step to unbundle Teams from Microsoft 365 in an effort to quash antitrust concerns by the EU. However, the Commission said in its Tuesday statement that the changes were \u201cinsufficient to address its concerns and that more changes to Microsoft\u2019s conduct are necessary to restore competition.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft said it would work to find solutions to address the additional Commission\u2019s concerns. \u201cHaving unbundled Teams and taken initial interoperability steps, we appreciate the additional clarity provided today,\u201d Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith said in a statement Tuesday. The company\u2019s shares were broadly unchanged in pre-market trading Tuesday.\n\nThe EU opened its investigation into Microsoft \u2014 which remains ongoing \u2014 in July 2023 following a complaint by Salesforce-owned Slack, which has a rival chat service to Teams.\n\nThe Commission\u2019s concerns are centered around the fact that, starting in around 2019, Microsoft tied Teams with its software-as-a-service \u2014 or SaaS \u2014 applications, such as Office. It notes that Microsoft is \u201cdominant worldwide\u201d in the SaaS market for professional productivity applications.\n\n\u201cIn particular, the Commission is concerned that Microsoft may have granted Teams a distribution advantage by not giving customers the choice whether or not to acquire access to Teams when they subscribe to their SaaS productivity applications,\u201d EU regulators wrote, noting that the tech giant\u2019s advantage may have been exacerbated by limitations of interoperability \u2014 the ability of two or more systems to work together \u2014 between Microsoft\u2019s offerings and Teams\u2019 competitors.\n\n\u201cThe conduct may have prevented Teams\u2019 rivals from competing, and in turn innovating, to the detriment of customers in the European Economic Area,\u201d the Commission said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/microsofts-abusive-bundling-of-teams-office-products-breached-antitrust-rules-eu-says.html", "id": "1do4yti", "created_utc": 1719319064.0, "score": 288, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 105, "comments": [{"body": "They should charge them rather for the poor software design.", "score": 83, "replies": [{"body": "You mean the bloatware too right", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26520463824272156}, {"body": "Man this is a fucking stupid take.
