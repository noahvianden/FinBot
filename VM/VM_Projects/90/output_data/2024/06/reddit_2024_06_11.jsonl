I think I got what you're saying there. The robotaxis/$25k car were delayed so that Tesla could test some of the new technologies on the model 3 and model y production line. They were worried it would be too difficult, as we've seen their difficulties with the cybertruck line. The probably want to test smaller gigacastings, 48V architecture, steer by wire, and ethernet wiring on the Model 3 and Model Y (and cybertruck) first before jumping right into their fully unboxed manufacturing process.\n\nAs I've outlined the 3 and Y being good enough to start the robotaxis network, why wouldn't it be a good idea for them to delay manufacturing of the purpose-built robotaxis in favor of more advanced 3 and y models? Seems like they're just leveraging their existing tech to start the robotaxis network earlier. It'll still be insanely profitable on the 3 and Y we honestly don't even need a purpose built robotaxi. Iirc waymo and cruise each have less than 1000 robotaxis (less than 2k total). If Tesla solves FSD, they could very easily obliterate both companies with even a small test network of less than 10,000 robotaxis.

Tesla can start their network by building model 3s and Ys without selling them for use on their robotaxis network and build the purpose-built robotaxis later.\n\nAlso, I've been using FSDv12.3.6 (second newest release as of this comment, 12.4.1 is being used by some customers already) and imo they're extremely close. I don't think it's years away anymore (tried v11 july 2023 and it wasnt great, just okay). They've definitely had a breakthrough with v12, and it's so good that it can safely drive me from point A to point B in 98% or so of the situations I've thrown at it without me intervening. Except in parking lots, it cant select a parking spot yet but all they have to do is link FSD with autopark and they should be good to go. Because of this I think it's highly likely FSD will be robotaxis-capable this year or mid-2025 at the latest. Other than parking lot stuff it might already be capable in certain easier-to-drive areas.
