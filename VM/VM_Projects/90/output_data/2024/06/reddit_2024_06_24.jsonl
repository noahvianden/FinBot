{"title": "European Union regulators accuse Apple of breaching the bloc's tech rules ", "selftext": "European Union regulators on Monday said that Apple is in breach of sweeping new tech rules because it does not allow customers of its App Store to be steered to alternatives.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU\u2019s executive arm, also said it had opened a new probe into Apple into new contractual terms with developers.\n\nThe EU opened an investigation into Apple, Alphabet and Meta in March under a landmark new law known as the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which aims to reel in the power of Big Tech firms. So-called anti-steering rules were one of the big areas of focus of the probe. Under the DMA, tech firms are not allowed to block businesses from telling their users about cheaper options for their products or about subscriptions outside of an app store.\n\nOn Monday, regulators said in their preliminary findings that Apple was in breach of the DMA because its App Store rules \u201cprevent app developers from freely steering consumers to alternative channels for offers and content.\u201d\n\nCNBC has reached out to Apple for comment.\n\nApple only allows steering through a system where app developers can provide a link that sends users to a webpage where they can then purchase content, such as a subscription, according to the Commission. However, this process is \u201csubject to several restrictions imposed by Apple that prevent app developers from communicating, promoting offers and concluding contracts through the distribution channel of their choice,\u201d the Commission noted.\n\nThe regulators also said that the fees Apple charges developers for the initial acquisition of new customers via the App Store \u201cgo beyond what is strictly necessary.\u201d The Commission did not disclose what represents a \u201cstrictly necessary\u201d fee.\n\nApple could face fines of up to 10% of the company\u2019s total worldwide annual turnover, if it is found in breach of the DMA.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant has been in EU\u2019s crosshairs this year. Regulators hit Apple with a 1.8 billion euro ($1.93 billion) antitrust fine in March for abusing its dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps. The steering rules were also a focus in that investigation.\n\nEU opens another DMA probe\n\nApple made some big changes to its App Store in the EU this year in anticipation of the DMA. The Cupertino giant now allows apps to be downloaded from websites, as well as third-party app stores on its devices.\n\nBut the Commission also raised concerns about some of Apple\u2019s new practices.\n\nApple still charges a \u201ccore technology fee\u201d of 50 euro cents ($0.54) per app installed for downloads outside its own App Store. The Commission said it is looking into whether this complies with the DMA.\n\nRegulators are also looking at whether the steps Apple makes users take to download alternative app stores or apps comply with the bloc\u2019s rules.\n\nThe Commission will also look at whether \u201celigibility requirements related to the ability to offer alternative app stores or directly distribute apps from the web on iPhones\u201d is also in compliance with the tech law.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/24/apple-app-store-rules-are-in-breach-eu-tech-rules-regulators-say.html", "id": "1dnasfp", "created_utc": 1719226990.0, "score": 170, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "I will be curious to see if they open up the app store if Google decides to do an app store for iOS.\n\nMake a lot of sense.", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Honestly, it\u2019s wild how long they got away with it.\n\nIt\u2019s your phone, how is it that Apple blocks you from installing other apps you want?
