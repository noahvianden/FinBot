Let me try to say how to make it happen. \n\nI see QQQ expiry in 320 days and 470 days. I pick 470 days since it is longer than 1 year. Feel free to change to suit your timeframe.\n\nCurrent price is 445, there is no strike at 445, so I pick 450. 450 strike is priced at 33, whereas 440 strike is priced at 29.

Our theta gangers like to write puts at delta 30, that's too rich for my taste in this specific case since we want to make money on the crash. So instead of writing put at 435 (30 delta) and get 5.5 bucks back, let's write a put at 420, April expiry, and make 2.5 bucks. Does not cut down our cost much but repeat it 2-3 times it would not hurt as much. I am not saying you will be able to repeat it every single month because hey what if price moves to 500? Or 600? Just creating the initial position to take some cost away. 435 is basically not betting on crash, 420 at least takes it beyond halfway to our expiry break even. \n\nThis is basically a poor man's covered put in structure but with deltas totally out of what but it starts with your premise of ATM put. \n\nRead up more on PmCC and PMcP and see if you can fine tune it further.\n\nOf course this trade does not give you the benefit of seeing QQQ crash to 150 bucks, 250 bucks or even 350 bucks but it is a starting move and if you can run multiple contracts some of them could be just pure long puts as long as you finance them right.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": ["vix", "crash"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "No one can tell what the market will do or when, so this is in effect a gamble.\n\nIMO using a diagonal that sells OTM puts which can help pay for the long put while waiting for whatever you think is going to happen, but this will also limit the possible profits.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "(I'm commenting here because I always appreciate your analysis on this subreddit).

If the stock goes up you keep the gains and lose the \"insurance\" premium, if the stock goes below the strike price the put option kicks in and compensates for the losses below that strike price.\n\nOr if you're already in long term capital gains territory, sell all of it and buy some long term at-the-money call options instead. This is equivalent to the stock + put option strategy, and more capital efficient, but don't do this if you're still in short term capital gains territory as you'll incur a lot of taxes for selling.\n\nOptions are notoriously \"dangerous\" if used recklessly, but when used correctly, they can be safer. You can continue to get the same leverage as 50% of your portfolio's worth of stock but using only 10% of the capital, and capping your losses at 10%.

If you're in your 50s and a loss would be catastrophic to your retirement fund, or you're investing an inheritence windfall that you could never make on your own, or you don't have a family safety net, or you have debt, then absolutely diversify and be protective of it.\n\nA lot of times the way I frame risky financial bets is this: **\"If I lost it all, how long would it take me to make that amount of cash back from my employment?\"**", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0010930742137134075}, {"body": "Rule of thumb is sell one third at 100% up", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.028960568830370903}, {"body": "You will never get bankrupt by selling while in profit.
