This corresponds to a potential 14% upside for Nvidia.\r  \n\r  \nRiding on the artificial intelligence craze, Nvidia stock has largely fueled the market rally in 2024. Its shares have already gained 60% in 2024.\r  \n\r  \nAnalyst Louis Miscioscia called Nvidia the \u201cbig winner\u201d when it comes to AI, listing several catalysts including the company\u2019s library of AI programming support that makes their platform easier to use versus competitors. Additionally, the firm\u2019s familiarity and developer support and full stack solution are hard to beat.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cMany reports suggest AMD/Intel GPUs are pretty darn powerful, they are, but it is not just about silicon, it is the full solution,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNvidia is in the right place at the right time.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nBut the larger question centers around how long Nvidia stock can keep rallying to new heights. However, Miscioscia voiced his optimism that the company could outperform in the long run, especially given a potential trillion-dollar opportunity for Nvidia.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThat Nvidia is seeing material inference GPU demand, bodes well for continued growth,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe basic concept is that x86 architecture, due to Moore\u2019s Law, is no longer seeing material performance improvements. To meet the new, modern DC processing demand levels, most applications should transition to run on GPUs. If there is a migration from x86 to GPU, this is a \u2018trillion\u2019 dollar upgrade opportunity.\u201d", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Accurate!
