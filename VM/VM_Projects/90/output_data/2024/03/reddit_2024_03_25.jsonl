{"title": "Reddit options launch draws bulls as shares extend gains", "selftext": "  \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Options on Reddit drew a flurry of bullish bets on Monday as the social media platform's stock rallied as much as 16% after last week's strong market debut.  \nReddit shares soared 48% on the New York Stock Exchange as the company went public on Thursday, despite posting no annual profit since its launch in 2005.  \nOn Monday, Reddit was among the top gainers on the New York Stock Exchange, with the stock last up 15% at $53.01 in early afternoon trading.  \nSome 39,000 options traded by 1:10 p.m. (1710 GMT), with volume on pace to hit 62,000 contracts by the end of the day, Trade Alert data showed.  \nThe 2012 listing of options on Facebook Inc, now known as Meta Platforms, holds the record for the most active options market debut with some 360,000 contracts changing hands on the first day of trading.  \nReddit options buyers leaned toward bullish bets, analysts said.  \n\"The action is on the call side and collected around the upside,\" said Ophir Gottlieb, chief executive of Los Angeles-based Capital Market Laboratories. \"With the stock trading higher on Day One, this feels like speculation for higher moves.\"  \nApril call options with strike prices of $50 to $75 were among the most actively traded Reddit contracts. Among puts, contracts guarding against a drop below $25 by mid-April were the most traded.  \nCalls convey the right to buy shares at a fixed price in the future, while puts offer the right to sell them at a set price.  \n\"Reddit trading is reminding me of meme stocks,\" said Matt Amberson, founder of options analytics service ORATS, referring to stocks with viral popularity among individual investors who often use options to express their views.  \n\"Retail is in control and buying calls to the moon,\" Amberson said.  \nMeme stocks emerged in 2020, led by GameStop whose price rose as much as 100 times over several months in 2021, largely on the sentiment of individual buyers connected through the Reddit community forum WallStreetBets.  \nCommenters on Reddit's largest stock trading forums voiced skepticism about the long-term outlook for the money-losing company's shares.  \n\"Considering that Reddit can serve as a forum for individual investor speculation, it's no surprise that we see heavy buying of upside, near-term calls,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers.  \n\"The fact that we're seeing so much activity in far out-of-the-money options \u2013 in both directions \u2013 tells me that speculators are driving the trading today,\" he said.  \n(Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; Editing by Megan Davies and Richard Chang)\n\n  \nSource: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reddit-options-launch-draws-bulls-174113771.html  \n", "id": "1bnkezx", "created_utc": 1711390010.0, "score": 246, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 127, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019m over there on another Reddit forum and was like, \u2018shoot 1pm totally forgot to check the price at close!?\u2019 \n\nNot a shareholder (hm idk yet) but nicely done", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "Closed at $59.80, but tomorrow who knows.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "$69.42 tomorrow", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "it hit $69 in after hours", "score": 8, "replies": [{"body": "It rejected off the target haha \ud83c\udfaf", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16331960260868073}, {"body": "Actually, 62.80 at close of A.H.

I would be a bit worried that their ecosystem is going to get cracked by regulators and they are going to lose that competitive advantage.\n\nLong term I believe Apple is a very developer unfriendly company and focuses too much on the consumer.

However, I can't think of a single time in recent memory a US Anti-trust lawsuit has resulted in a meaningful depreciation of a company.

I think the result of the suit will likely be GOOD for the consumer, but it won't kill Apple.\n\nAs far as being developer unfriendly, it really doesn't matter much to the bottom line imo. I know that Apple is an aggressive, sinister, and cutthroat company in the way it treats both consumers and developers, but at the end of the day, you can't say it hasn't been good for their bottom line. And as long as Apple holds a majority stake in the most important hardware market of this century, devs will still write for it. As much as I'd l love to see devs getting a bigger slice of the pie, especially regarding apps, the reality of it is that apple is just one side of a duopoly, and Google really isn't much better in that regard.\n\nApple is extremely smart with the malicious compliance that they react to regulators with. Look at their repairability program for example, a complete farce. If the DOJ forces apple to make apple watch work on Android, they will do anything in their power to make that experience terrible. Side loading apps to circumvent their appstore? They'll make it a huge pain in the ass.\n\nTbh though, I do think Apple may be dead money for the next 6+ months, but I'm up quite a bit, so I don't want to sell and take a tax hit.\n\nI definitely am concerned with the amount of pressure apple has been taking recently, I stopped buying the stock, and am holding.

This is just a small window into the headache that is developing for iOS. The only major advantage they have is consistency in devices compared to Android, that poses it's own set of headaches for developers.\n\nAnyways Apple is probably a hold, especially if you are going to take the tax hit by selling, but it's probably trading sideways for the next year.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "But people will die apple users over switching to anything else, its a cult following basically.
