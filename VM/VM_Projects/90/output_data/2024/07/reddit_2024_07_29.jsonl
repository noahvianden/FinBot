Different architecture, maybe, but who knows where stealth labs are with that, could be decades away.\n\nHowever, what is the value of LLMs as they are today? I firmly believe consumer LLMs are leveling out with diminishing returns. A lot of what OpenAI has been showing recently off has looked amazing in demos, but either not been delivered, or hasn't found a use. Like Sora, looked amazing, but has no real world use case that justifies the cost of its full potential. And then there is their voice model which looked just incredible in demos, but hasn't been delivered. I imagine cost to run that, and reliability is a major factor. The compute to deliver that voice model in the latency demonstrated must be enormous. ChatGPT 4o pro costs over CAD$30, do we really think that regular folks are going to pay more for fancier voice? Their image generation is noticeably worse.\n\nWhat we will likely see is \"good enough\" models enhancing search and other traditional web uses. Everything else is going to be subscription for power users that can justify the cost, and that isn't going to be something widely adopted.\n\nIf Nvidia can deliver inexpensive, more efficient chips then they are seeing the same horizon. But competitors are likely working on this too. And as you said, we might be in a world where cheap CPUs get mashed together to do the lion's share of LLM work that can be ad/user data supported just like traditional web.\n\nThe idea of LLMs being a transformative, new world, paradigm changer is quickly evaporating. The hype is settling down. I skip over LLM \"shocked the industry\" videos because they are all hyperbole demos, speculation, and circlejerk commentary.\n\nI predict Nvidia will slowly spin down to around where it was pre LLM hype. They will continue to make good money, sustain great products, but the demand for their most powerful chips will drop off over the next couple of years when the industry has all had a go at making money out of their crazy huge investments.\n\nDon't get me wrong, LLMs are useful, here to stay, but the frontier is getting close to a boundary.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5759403705596924}], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "People just think about pe ratio and not forward pe ratio, and the growth.

{"title": "How to stop being greedy while trading? ", "selftext": "I have been involved in stock and crypto markets since 2021. Honestly I love trading but my problem is I always hold too long because I keep thinking the market will always swing back to the way I want it to.  Here\u2019s a perfect example: \n\nJust last week I was trading an option out for NVDA last Thursday. I got in the trade early at 8:30 central time exactly when the bell rung while I was at work at my retail job.  Within 25 minutes I made $280 (270% return) and I didn\u2019t pull the trigger and sell because I thought the stock was going to go as low as 109 based on the chart reading and levels I had mapped out on my phone. \n\n30 minutes later it\u2019s now 9am and I went on my first break of the day at work. I\u2019m sitting in the break room looking at my phone happy as can be thinking to myself I\u2019m going to make what I make half of my paycheck in one day. As I\u2019m watching I see the first sign of trouble and the stock bounces after it caught support around 111.90 range. I debated on selling then but my gut instinct said wait to see how this plays out and sure enough it started moving sideways all day long until about after lunch that day. The theta has already burned my profits from $280 down to $190. Then I see it hit resistance and I\u2019m thinking to myself there is ZERO chance it breaks resistance it needs to go back down but nope I was wrong and the stock made a $4 dollar jump and I ended up losing everything in that trade because of my own stupidity of being too greedy. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this has happened to me I have had many of these trades play out like this. I think if I wasn\u2019t such a greedy trader my overall profits would easily be 150-200k by now. My biggest day trade was about $2500. My bar is set so high that I don\u2019t feel satisfied unless I make $500-1000 in a single trade. I know on Wall St they are more than happy with a 30% return which I can hit easily with no problems only difference is they are trading with larger capital and I\u2019m trading a few hundreds or thousands at a time. \n\nAny tips to help me solve this?\n", "id": "1ef6rbr", "created_utc": 1722277323.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 1 | **First Seen In WSB** | just now\n**Total Comments** | 0 | **Previous Best DD** | \n**Account Age** | 2 years | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15035580098628998}, {"body": "It's obvious you aren't trading a plan.

The house always wins and although you might hit a hot streak, the longer you are in the odds are you will end up with $0.\n\nThe best way to do it is to set stop losses and sell/buy price at the time of your trade. That way you take the emotion out of it and trade purely on your technicals. Trade as if you were on the Spectrum...no emotion just pure logic. You will start to realize where/when you are making technical mistakes, if you really understand a stock's trading behavior, or understand if a stock has momentum's etc. Emotions cloud all that and at that point you are trading on instinct and that will lead you to a $0 account. \n\nI admit, I struggle with it still.

And if I want to buy a position, I will sell puts to get a lower entry price or keep the premium.  \n\nIf what I just said is even more greek to you, then you better start studying and lay off the trades. Then, open a paper trading account and practice doing small transactions to learn without losing real money.

If I had 1k shares of AAPL while stock is at $220, I could sell October 230s for $3.5 (making it up) and generate $3.5k while the stock lingers.

And I am not looking at my individual trades, I am looking at my net gain at the end of the year and seeing how I can outperform the market. I want to win the war, knowing that I will lose some battles along the way.\n\nAnd I study charts every day. I look at multiple time periods. 5 min, 15 min, hourly, daily weekly and monthly.  You need the entire view and I use candlestick charts so you can see the action happening for each time period.\n\nFor instance, SPY is forming a shooting star candle on the monthly as we close the month. RSI topping out on the monthly, starting to turn negative on the weekly, and daily is heading down. August is the month where traders go on vacation. And tomorrow is the EOM so the funds need to rejigger their positions.  \n\nHere is my hunch for Friday 31st. We open higher in the morning to bring in the suckers and drive up the option prices for calls and down for puts. My guess is around 12-1 ET, market holds sideways a bit to kill the IV, and then the bottom falls out around 2-2:30p. And after I typed that I checked a thread that I follow with other traders, they believe the same thing. Sell the gap up tomorrow - so that would mean buy daily puts and be prepared to trade in/out over a very short period of time. 1-2 hours.  Might be able to buy some puts for .30c and sell for $3 if it goes to plan. But they will have stops at .20c if it doesn't. still lose a third but better than losing it all.\n\nIf we open lower and still run up, theory is probably still in tact.
