Even after the market turnaround in 2002-3 those stocks just languished for what seemed like forever.  Some of them went away.\n\nSplit-adjusted, my basis for NVDA is $0.20/sh.  It had been at s-a $0.55 just a year before (January '02), so it seemed ripe for the picking.  Sounds great/smart/well-timed, right?  Well, for a very long time it wasn't.  In August of 2010, after holding more than seven years, it was worth exactly the same as when I bought it.  By 2012 it was starting to move up (s-a $0.28), but mostly sideways in the s-a $0.30s for years before finally starting to take off.\n\nI got so disenchanted with the equity markets (and I'm a financial advisor!) I decided to just not ever look at my portfolio.  This is what I encourage others to do, as long as you believe in the company's fundamentals and management stays true to them.  \n\nI feel like I've owned a lot of high quality companies over the years (INTC, for example) that just didn't pan out while I held them.
