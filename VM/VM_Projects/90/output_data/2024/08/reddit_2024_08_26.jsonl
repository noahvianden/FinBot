{"title": "NVDA call risk of holding through earnings?", "selftext": "Picked up these two 11/15/24 110c on that nice dip a few weeks ago (the only time I wanted to pay the longer call prices). My general strategy is to buy mid-long and sell about half the position to cover the rest if it gains 50-100%, or exit before 30-45 DTE especially if theta goes much above ~0.15. This has treated me well with about 100% overall account gain in 6 months. I know it\u2019s a lot of luck too. \nI think the conservative thing would be to sell one of these two calls now before earnings on Weds to cover the remaining one and capture a 20% gain. Then, I\u2019d let that remaining one ride to capture any further upside.\nHowever, given they have a Nov expiry (and it\u2019s NVDA, and still well below the ATH) it may be good to keep both since the expiry is almost to next earnings and it could run up quite a bit the next couple months. How would you make this decision, and with what factors?\n\nI\u2019m generally familiar with the Greeks but not necessarily how to use them well and what levels apply to different position setups/decisions.\n( just reading my own writing now it comes off as desperate and clingy to baby\u2019s first NVDA long calls lol. )\n", "id": "1f1t8bn", "created_utc": 1724691533.0, "score": 222, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "I think with the market on a knife\u2019s edge basically dependent on which way NVDA goes post earnings, it would probably be wise to take your win and start planning for next week.", "score": 117, "replies": [{"body": "Semi's down 2% today on NVDA earrings concerns.
