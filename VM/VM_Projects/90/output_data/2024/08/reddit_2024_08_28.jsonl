I bought 1000 shares. That with two splits became 40,000 with a cost basis of 5.90\n\n I bought back in and picked up 1500 more this last fall with a cost basis of \\~64 before the last 10-1 split.\n\nI've been in for 5 years. I've seen NVDA's earnings all over the place, from missing to massive beats.\n\n  \nIf you don't understand that a marginal \"beat\" is bad for the stock, lower margins(I'm a little worried with how low they're going to go as Jensen said they will go lower on the call) and missing on net revenue for a GROWTH company like NVDA is in \"no way a miss,\" and you're using analysts price targets, you are out of your depth and you need to get into EFTs.\n\n  \nIf you knew nothing else about this company than the fundamentals right now, there would be ZERO reason to stay in and I'd take the 55,000 shares I've accumulated and sell.\n\nBut I DO know something else about this company. They have Blackwell coming out. They won't see the profits on that for two more Quarters(or rather not next ER, but the following) and they won't see the true breadth of that revenue until the following year.\n\n  \nThe professionals WERE wrong. They were expecting closer to 32-34B and a more definitive answer on Blackwell. They didn't get it. \n\nThat's why I'm risking mid 7 figures and staying in. Because I believe NVDA will get back and have better quarters and they have so much cash, they can afford a buyback. \n\nBut with this earnings, they should not be a 3.2T market cap, much less the 4-5T that was suggested.
