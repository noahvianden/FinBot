What you have to decide is whether that combination of the business being high quality and the price being right is right in this situation.\n\nThe people telling you 'don't time the market' are not really accurate. You shouldn't try to time the *market* when you buy index funds, because nobody can predict the market. But buying individual stocks does require a timing element - which is actually a valuation element. What price are you going to buy at, what price are you going to sell at? Every security you buy needs to be bought with those things in mind.\n\nYou should not buy a stock right now. The reason for that is you are new to this, and you say you find the information confusing to parse, so you are relying on other peoples advice to work out what to do. That is a big problem. The reason it's a big problem is that the majority of people who invest in individual stocks (as opposed to investing in the whole stock market, through index funds) don't do well. They underperform index fund investors. Probably something like 90% of people underperform the index investors in the long term, including most of the people who post here, and most professional investors too.\n\nGo away and learn about investing *away* from reddit. Books and videos are the best way to learn. Phil Fisher's book *Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits* is the gold standard.

Learn something about what you're going to buy. \n\nIf you are sitting on a lot of money doing nothing with it, don't be in a rush.

I wish i could post a photo in the comments because it's absolutely spooky how similar the charts look. It's part of the cyclicality of GPU sales. NVIDIA stock would never have reached these highs if it grew this revenue gradually vs a sudden hype cycle driven spike. Company pulls in cash like meta and trades like apple. Whether they go on to become the worlds biggest company long term, short term it's raising a lot of questions.\n\nAgain my outlook here is short term to mid term regarding entry positions especially for new traders. I personally thought earnings was fantastic and inspired all kinds of hype in me about the companies future. I just expect potentially massive volatility in the coming months", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda", "aapl", "nvda", "meta", "bubble", "recovery"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6042094230651855}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5685310363769531}, {"body": "I\u2019ve read where the stock is overvalued right now and it\u2019s very volatile.

NVDA stock has been pumped up with growth speculation which earnings have demonstrated are not impressing wall street any longer.\n\nIt's an excellent company long term, don't get me wrong. My only concern is the stock chart is showing textbook signs of market bubble formation so there may be a massive shakeout in the near term. For people who've held the stock long term this may another day in the life. But new investors who are coming in late in the cycle with fear of missing out are likely to panic sell if and when things get ugly.\n\nIt's important to note that NVDA has been doing this their entire existence. Parabolic runs followed by parabolic drops. Overall massive growth, but big shakeups in between. This is due to the cyclicality of GPU sales which are driven by tech hype cycles (like AI, crypto, whatever) leading to sudden spikes in earnings.\n\nWait for a better entry.
