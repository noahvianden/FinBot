What you're saying doesn't make sense, nor is it even rhetorically true. Tesla has no non-geofenced L4 approach at all at the moment, their non-geo-fenced operation scale is zero, while their L4 fenced operation is also zero. At L2, they have the same or a similar fence as most other L2 competitors.\n\nFrom an approach perspective (particularly algorithms and architecture) the notion that Tesla is \"significantly further\" towards \"not geofenced\" than some abstract set of competitors is... almost incoherent gibberish non-language.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "If one group's solution is 'high resolution mapping of an area required' and the other is 'general solution that could be flipped on that does not require prior mapping'\n\nThen on a geofenced to not geofenced spectrum then competitors in a landscape that resemble the first are 'more geofenced' and ones more closely resembling the latter are 'less geofenced'\n\nIf you're opinion is \"What Tesla is doing at WB is geofenced\" - therefore what? Thats what I don't understand, therefore what?\n\nI'm saying Tesla's FSD approach is least-geofenced compared to competitors, so in a landscape of competitors when discussing the company on a stock subreddit, focusing on Tesla 'being geofenced' sounds like a motivated, unfair, dishonest way of looking at the situation.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">If one group's solution is 'high resolution mapping of an area required' and the other is 'general solution that could be flipped on that does not require prior mapping'\n\nYou're legitimately not making sense here.\n\nMaps aren't solutions, they're implementation details within solutions. They aren't typically requisite architectural pieces, and not having them within an architecture isn't a solution or asset in itself. There also aren't two groups here \u2014\u00a0there are many competing groups, all of them using different comprehensive strategies. Finally, you seem to be suggesting Tesla has a general solution that could be flipped on which does not 'require' prior mapping, but Tesla has no such solution. Tesla's 'non-geofenced' and 'no-maps' solution, once again, has no scale at L4. Zero.\n\n>If you're opinion is \"What Tesla is doing at WB is geofenced\" - therefore what? Thats what I don't understand, therefore what?\n\nTherefore it is geofenced. There is no other 'what'. A thing which has some attribute has that attribute. A red shaggy dog is red and shaggy, there is no 'therefore'. A geofenced demo is geofenced and a demo. Therefore it is a geofenced demo. We stop there.\n\n>I'm saying Tesla's FSD approach is least-geofenced compared to competitors\n\nObjectively, this is not correct. I get you're *saying* it, but it is not correct. At L4, Tesla has the strictest geofence of all, one which is of zero size.
