I guess it makes sense as their earnings have also been beating by smaller amounts each quarter. And the Blackwell delay could impact their guidance as well. \n\nHow do you think Nvidia will do?

In theory, if it barely beats or even misses, could it send the whole market tumbling? \n\nThese are just my thoughts right now.

However, without ESPN+, the direct-to-consumer streaming unit reported a loss of $19 million.\n\nMeanwhile, last quarter, Disney+ and Hulu together turned a profit, but when combined with ESPN+, the streaming businesses suffered a loss.\n\nDisney recently changed how it reports its segments, with ESPN falling under its sports unit, and Disney+ and Hulu being counted as part of the direct-to-consumer entertainment segment. Disney and its peers have been focused on streaming reaching profitability as the traditional TV business bleeds customers.\n\nDisney+ Core subscribers \u2014 which excludes Disney+ Hotstar in India and other countries in the region \u2014 increased by 1% to 118.3 million, despite the company\u2019s earlier guidance it wouldn\u2019t add new customers during the fiscal third quarter. Total Hulu subscribers grew 2% to 51.1 million.\n\nRevenue for the entertainment segment was up 4% to $10.58 billion, driven largely by subscription revenue growth due to price increases and customer growth for Disney+ Core. The company announced further streaming price hikes on Tuesday. Revenue for the traditional TV networks was down 7%.\n\nDisney\u2019s overall revenue increased 4% to $23.155 billion compared with the same period last year.\n\nHowever, while Disney\u2019s entertainment and sports divisions drove earnings, the U.S. theme parks business was impacted by slowing consumer demand and inflation.\n\n\u201cThe portfolio is working well,\u201d Disney CFO Hugh Johnston said. \u201cYes there was softness in the domestic parks, but the entertainment division\u2019s profit tripled in the quarter.\u201d \n\nDisney\u2019s parks have been a key profit driver, and the company has pledged to spend roughly $60 billion on its theme parks over the next decade.\n\nRevenue for the overall experiences unit, which includes domestic and international parks and experiences, as well as consumer products, was up 2% to $8.386 billion. \n\nOperating income for U.S. parks was down 6%, while international parks operating income was up 2%. The company attributed the decrease in operating income at the domestic parks to higher costs driven by inflation, as well as increased technology spending and new guest offerings.\n\nThis carried over from the previous quarter, when Disneyland Resort in California was under pressure with lower profits, with executives citing similar reasons.\n\nLast month Comcast\u2019s earnings were weighed down by its Universal theme parks, which the company attributed to increased competition from cruises and international tourism. Despite this, Comcast executives said they remained \u201cbullish\u201d on the business, especially with a new theme park opening in 2025.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/07/disney-dis-q3-earnings-report-2024.html", "id": "1em8wk5", "created_utc": 1723028619.0, "score": 224, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": "It seems pretty surprising that their streaming service is finally profitable this quarter, especially with absolutely no notable new releases on their platforms.
