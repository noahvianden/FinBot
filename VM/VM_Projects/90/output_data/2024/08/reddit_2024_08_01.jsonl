{"title": "Apple sales rise 5%, topping estimates as iPad and Services revenue jump", "selftext": "Apple reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, with overall revenue rising 5%.  \n\nHere\u2019s how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended June 29: \n\nEPS: $1.40 vs. $1.35 estimated\n \nRevenue: $85.78 billion vs. $84.53 billion estimated \n\niPhone revenue: $39.30 billion vs. $38.81 billion estimated \n\nMac revenue: $7.01 billion vs. $7.02 billion estimated \n\niPad revenue: $7.16 billion vs. $6.61 billion estimated \n\nWearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $8.10 billion vs. $7.79 billion estimated \n\nServices revenue: $24.21 billion vs. $24.01 billion estimated \n\nGross margin: 46.3% vs. 46.1% estimated \n\nApple did not provide formal guidance, although CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri often share information about the current quarter on a call with analysts.  \n\nApple reported $21.44 billion in net income during the quarter, versus $19.88 billion in the year-ago period.  \n\nApple\u2019s most important business remains the iPhone, which accounted for about 46% of the company\u2019s total sales during the quarter. While Apple beat LSEG estimates, the product line still declined about 1% on an annual basis to $39.29 billion in revenue.  \n\n\u201cOn a constant currency basis, we grew year on year. And so that\u2019s sort of how we look at it from an operational point of view,\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC\u2019s Steve Kovach.  \n\nCook said that while Apple doesn\u2019t know about the positive sales impact from its newly announced Apple Intelligence service until it starts shipping to customers later this fall, he said that Apple had been increasing spending to get the service ready.  \n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve redeployed a lot of people on to AI that were working on other things,\u201d Cook said. \u201cFrom a data center point of view, as you know, we have a hybrid approach. So we both have our own and we partner with people. And so that capex would be in the partners\u2019 financials, and we would be paying expense.\u201d \n\n\u201cCertainly embedded in our results this quarter is an increase year over year in the amount we\u2019re spending for AI and Apple intelligence,\u201d Cook continued.  \n\nApple showed strongest growth in its iPad division, which grew nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion in sales. Apple released new iPads during the quarter for the first time since 2022, which spurred a wave of upgrades. \n\nCook said that about half of iPad buyers haven\u2019t owned one before, suggesting the tablet market is not yet saturated. \n\nApple\u2019s Mac division reported $7 billion in sales, up about 2% from the year-ago quarter.  \n\nApple Watch sales, headphones such as Beats or AirPods, and HomePod home speakers are reported under \u201cWearables, Home, and Accessories.\u201d Sales in the catch-all category declined 2% to $8.10 billion during the quarter.  \n\n\u201cA whopping two thirds of the Apple Watch buyers were new to the product. So, we\u2019re still growing that base significantly,\u201d Cook said.  \n\nThe Services business is most important growth category for Apple and includes hardware warranties, revenue from Google, monthly cloud storage subscriptions, and the company\u2019s content subscriptions, such as Apple TV+. The company reported $24.21 billion in Services sales, up 14% and in-line with Apple\u2019s forecast and LSEG estimates. \n\nApple said in a statement that it had more active devices in each of its regions than it ever had before, without providing a specific number. Apple\u2019s active device count is important because it signifies a group of existing Apple customers to which it can sell its profitable services. Apple said in February that it had 2.2 billion active devices.  \n\nApple said it had 1 billion paid subscriptions, which includes subscriptions to iPhone apps through Apple\u2019s App Store.  \n\nHowever, Apple sales declined 6% to $14.72 billion in greater China, a region that also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong. Apple is under pressure in mainland China as local rivals such as Huawei introduce competing products.  \n\n\u201cMainland China and Greater China actually had a record in the iPhone install base,\u201d Cook said. \u201cKantar tells us we had the top three selling smartphones in urban China and the results in China represent an acceleration from the first half of the year.\u201d \n\nApple said it spent $32 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/01/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q3-2024.html", "id": "1ehr1f1", "created_utc": 1722544422.0, "score": 486, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "Let Tim Cook", "score": 235, "replies": [{"body": "In Tim, we trust.", "score": 24, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4644348621368408}, {"body": "Apple could charge 2K for iPhones and they would still increase revenue", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.29190871119499207}, {"body": "Solid numbers - will be down - right?", "score": 171, "replies": [{"body": "Already going down", "score": 78, "replies": [{"body": "Yes Sir like clock work down we go", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Ah it went back up, I guess we better wait to see what happens tomorrow", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "Up to 225 then down to 210-212 then close 215-218 cause that's how stocks usually work on fridays.\n\nThe after hours we just had was basically a mini picture of it already.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4250042736530304}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1974061131477356}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27491870522499084}, {"body": "I swear Apple could cure cancer and blow earnings out of the water and it'd still drop 5%", "score": 22, "replies": [{"body": "Maybe if they showed some growth, their 30PE could be steady, but no one is paying that much for a flat company", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3623853325843811}], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Barely, it\u2019s actually green rn", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.03377462550997734}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13814246654510498}, {"body": "No \ud83e\udd16\u00a0", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09560226649045944}, {"body": "And the stock goes mild", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18542465567588806}, {"body": "iPhone sales which are their bread and butter are going to the shitter Apple is losing its edge slowly but it still is", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "In all seriousness why does this happen?
