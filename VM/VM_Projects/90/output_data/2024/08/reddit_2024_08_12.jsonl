The thing that \" is evident in the long-term charts of UVXY and VXX. These funds have a nasty tendency of absorbing negative roll yield for most of their existence. Because both UVXY and VXX purchase short-term VIX futures, they have to sell the front month futures and buy the back month futures. They must do this regularly. However, the term structure of these futures is usually in contango, which means the front month is cheaper than the back month. The fund pays out this difference to the market in exchange for the convexity offered by the VIX futures in the event of a market selloff. The negative roll yield is effectively an insurance premium paid for protection from a market crash. There is no free lunch.\n\n\"The UVXY, and UVIX plus a few other etfs are known as widow makers. They always reverse split.\n\nSVIX and / or SVXY are the safest bullish bets in the market at present .\n\nThese short the rise we saw in the recent VIX spike.\n\nOur stock market fundamentals are strong, with 79% of reporting companies beating earnings solidly.\n\nThe recent volatility , imo, was a reset of multiples or a \" correction \" that offered up some very good dips on high quality stocks.NVDA hit 90 and that was some 17 points ago.\n\nThere are many other examples one could cite.\n\nGuidance for our S& P companies are solid and the thing most are overlooking is that the growth and guidance suggest forward pe ratios that are still reflective of investment grade criteria", "id": "1eqkcyj", "created_utc": 1723485010.0, "score": 393, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions** | 10 | **First Seen In WSB** | 5 months ago\n**Total Comments** | 192 | **Previous Best DD** | [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e0wcfi/think_about_intc_in_this_context/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dumwon/nvidia_reality/) \n**Account Age** | 5 months | | \n\n[**Join WSB Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2617104947566986}, {"body": "The professor also wanted an emergency rate cut on Monday too", "score": 202, "replies": [{"body": "That douche bag is the biggest fucking whiner short of Ackman.

Pre market futures were jumping around like a cricket.\n\nSince July ,we have ben told to rotate out of mag 7 into small caps , and we have seen a vix spike to absurd levels.We have been told we were entering a recession .We have been told ai hype trade is overextended and to get out of ai stocks.We have been told by a a few so called reputable firms like Goldman and Boa that a recession is probable .We have been told that the yield inversion curve never fails to predict a recession and now we are being told a yield uninversion suggest a recession is at hand .We have been told the sahm rule being triggered means a recession is about to happen .We have been told valuations now matter.We have been told the yen carry trade needs to unwindI am sure I am missing several more conflicting things we have been told .\n\nNow I want to say what I think is reality.\n\nA) If valuations really mattered the whole market will sell off.\n\nB) The VIX is still elevated and I have never seen such a wide swath of confusion in my life.I see market gyrations that look very volatile and I think a potential for a flash crash is very elevated .\n\nP.S Japan is moving forward with their rate hikes and I wonder just how much more this yen carry trade unwind will resurface ?\n\n( something structural is wrong with the markets and I think it's going to manifest in an ugly way) Suggest taking profits\n\n( August until October is typically a sell side event for the market- see last years chart)\n\nThe rebound was a v shaped just as i stated and as such it also can reverberate as the underlying cause is still without clarity but probably related to the yen carry trade. The odte power to influence stock prices and the dark pool profiting off violent swings is very lucrative for the hedge funds . A few other factors but when the VIX spikes and the market corrects, the bulls and bears are like two boxers in the 5th round of a 12 round match and both are strong with something to prove. I don't think we can say all is clear and i put odds of violent swings at very elevated right now...\n\nWe have conflicted media and no real agreement on valuations and absolutely no sec oversight or else the VIX would not have spiked to 65 in a healthy market\n\nThe algos will dump trillions in market cap in hours\n\n  \nthe vix could spike right back to 29 for all we know at the moment", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Holy shit.
