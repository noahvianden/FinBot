NVDA is valued at present only because of the hype. People think NVDA will keep riding the wave for another 100 years.  There\u2019s no way they can keep their current position long term. As a first mover, they can also end up like Intel. Add to the mix their dependence on Taiwan. Everything can happen. I\u2019m my book this stock is ideal for swing trading. Never I\u2019ll hold this stock long term given the share of disruption coming in the near future.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda", "intc"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["nvda", "amzn"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Everyone is lecturing you about margins here as if nvidia can keep those margin levels forever.

But, it\u2019s just pointless to pat yourself on the back for sitting through a 65% downturn.\n\nYeah, it's also Ok to say you don't really understand what you're talking about if you think NVDA is on it's way to a 65% decline.\n\nYou just need to listen to GOOGL, META, AMZN, MSFT and their earnings reports and listen to what they've said about their projected AI CapEx, much of which is going to NVDA.\n\nThe AMZN earnings call talked about how they've got 90% of their servers on site, 10% off-site and 'if you expect those numbers to be inverse moving forward...as I think we all do, that kinda tells you how early we are into this AI buildout.'\n\nThat's not the exact quote, so I didn't use quotations, just paraphrasing, but...if you think it's dropping 65%, then yeah, get out. Almost no reasonable person expects the stock to drop 65% again as it did in '22. \n\n>Just spend some time learning how to make money in bull, bear and lateral markets instead of preaching virtues of hodling a SINGLE stock, which requires you to ignore the existence of Intel, GE and the fact that most companies in S&P 500 don\u2019t stay in the index for more than 15-20 yrs now. That duration has been shrinking.\n\n  \nCool. So...that portends what for the next \\~2 years for NVDA? \n\n  \nWhat point are you actually making?\n\nI'm just thrilled apparently not knowing what I'm doing. Bought 1,000 shares in 2020 at \\~48 a share. 4-1 split, 10-1 split...1.20 price point.\n\nBought 500 more this year at 488, 688, 250 at 770 and \\~820 before the 10-1 split.\n\nI'm just fine with NVDA. I may not be the guru you are...apparently by somehow conflating Intel with NVDA(that's a REALLY well-run company!)...I guess you're making SOME point? \n\nI'm not sure exactly what it is, but...it's something.\n\n  \nWhen NVDA comes in at 30B+ in revenue and again margins in the 70s(they may be down a bit as TSM has talked about raising prices)...then what are we looking at?\n\n  \nNVDA's biggest problem right now is not being able to meet demand fast enough. That's where TSM's earnings report was helpful as NVDA has gone from 44% of their business to 52% per last earnings. \n\n  \nYup.
