{"title": "Peloton partners with Costco to sell Bike+ as it looks to reach young, wealthy customers", "selftext": "Peloton\u2019s stationary bikes will soon sell at Costco\u2019s stores and on its website as the beleaguered fitness company looks for new ways to reach younger and affluent customers, Peloton is set to announce Tuesday.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Costco will offer Peloton\u2019s Bike+ in 300 of its U.S. stores for $1,999, and on Costco.com for $2,199 between Nov. 1 and Feb. 15. It is a steep discount from the typical price of the Bike+, which is selling on Peloton\u2019s website for $2,495. It is unclear how the price will compare to any holiday promotions Peloton plans to offer. \n\nThe new partnership comes during a state of transition for Peloton, which is being led by two board members after its former CEO Barry McCarthy stepped down earlier this year.\n\nLong focused on growth at all costs, Peloton has turned its sights to profitability and has had to become more creative as it tries to reach new users.\n\nAs sales fall and losses mount, Peloton is looking for cheaper ways to attract new customers. Costco is one way to get there, Dion Camp Sanders, Peloton\u2019s chief emerging business officer, told CNBC in an interview. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to architect a deal with Costco that meets our needs with regard to profitable, sustainable unit economics, while at the same time delivering robust and clear value to Costco members,\u201d said Camp Sanders. \u201cWe\u2019ve structured this deal with Costco to both meet our needs for profitable, sustainable growth and getting us access to Costco\u2019s very large net incremental audience.\u201d \n\nCamp Sanders said Peloton\u2019s partnership with Costco is only for a limited time because fitness is a seasonal category for the company, but Peloton hopes to keep building on the relationship and perhaps expand it to future locations both in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe deal with Costco gets Peloton onto the shelves of a retailer with a strong fan following and wealthier customers. The membership-based club has gained popularity as shoppers across all incomes prioritize value and try to get more for their money with bulk packs and private-label items.\n\nAs of Sept. 1, store traffic at Costco had increased 31% compared with the same period in pre-pandemic 2019, according to Placer.ai, an analytics company that estimates visits to locations based on smartphone data. \n\nCostco\u2019s members are also getting younger. Those consumers prioritize health and wellness \u2014 and are willing to invest in it \u2014 in ways that older generations do not. \n\nAbout half of Costco\u2019s new membership sign-ups last fiscal year came from people who were under 40 years old, and the average age of its 76 million members has fallen since the Covid-19 pandemic, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said on an earnings call in late September. \n\nAccording to Numerator, 36% of Costco\u2019s customers have a household income of more than $125,000. Numerator has a panel of 150,000 U.S. consumers that is balanced to be representative of the country\u2019s population.\n\nCamp Sanders said Costco\u2019s members \u201chave the disposable income to be able to afford our premium products,\u201d and their lifestyles align with what Peloton offers. \n\n\u201cMany of Peloton\u2019s members are affluent, they often have larger homes in the suburbs and they also have life situations where Peloton fits a clear need,\u201d said Camp Sanders. \u201cMany Costco members are juggling families, they maybe have a busy career \u2026 and they\u2019ve got the space in their home\u201d to build their own gyms, he continued. \n\nCostco\u2019s Executive Vice President of Merchandising Claudine Adamo declined to comment to CNBC.\n\nPeloton already sells its workout equipment through Amazon and Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, but has also been working to develop relationships with other companies that cater to similar customer bases. \n\nFor example, hundreds of Hyatt Hotel properties have Peloton equipment on site. As of this month, hotel members can earn points for completing workouts on the Peloton Bike and Row during their stay. \n\nIt also announced a deal with Truemed \u2014 the PayPal of the health savings account and flexible spending account world \u2014 that allows Peloton members to use pretax earnings to buy certain hardware products, including the Bike, Bike+ and Tread.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/22/peloton-costco-partner-to-sell-bike-for-2024-holiday.html", "id": "1g9hynq", "created_utc": 1729603205.0, "score": 81, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "Or just grab one for $300 on facebook marketplace", "score": 145, "replies": [{"body": "Why would I?

If it somehow goes in the money in that timeframe, you still break even. If you're willing to take some risk of getting called off in month 1, you can set the short leg at something like a 65c that makes around $2.50. The risk here is that if the stock moons in the first couple months you lose money, but if you pick something that's more likely to grind up than just suddenly moon (stay away from GME and the rest of the WSB shenanigans stocks) you can run this play and every month it doesn't hit, the more aggressive you can be and still have a low total risk of the short leg going ITM. Every month, you roll the short leg. Figure out how much risk of going ITM you want to take. If the stock tanks, you can sell short legs at around the same price as the long leg. If the stock climbs slowly, you can just raise the price at which you sell the short leg, even past the point of the long leg.\n\nBasically, what you're doing with calendars is you're taking advantage of the fact that theta decay is faster closer to the date of expiry.\n\nIt isn't free money, and you have to actively manage it at least monthly (though ideally you're looking at prices more often than that for management purposes) rather than sit on it and wait for prices to climb.
