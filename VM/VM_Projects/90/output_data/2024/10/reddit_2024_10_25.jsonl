{"title": "Stock price is so predictable sometimes...", "selftext": "Last week I pointed out the [call wall was at 138 and would be a magnet ](https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1g69idr/comment/lsjcz4b/)and it closed at 138 to the cent. This week I pointed out the [call wall was 142](https://www.reddit.com/r/NVDA_Stock/comments/1ga1l42/comment/ltclvg2/) and looks like it will close around there (usually at or below). I'm no Nostradamus, but it sure seems like someone is motivated to make those options expire worthless. It's not even like they're trying to hide it.\n\nWhen SP closes end of week at the call wall, it usually means there's upward pressure on the stock, but \"they\" are shorting the stock to keep it down until the options they sold expire worthless. Then the SP shoots up next week when they buy back the shares they sold to suppress the stock price the previous week.\n\nIt doesn't always happen, especially when unexpected news is especially bad or good. Examples are big earnings report surprises or exuberance with related stocks like QQQ. In the absence of anything significant, it cannot be discounted as a coincidence.\n\nTo get to the point, next week there are lots of key ER from Mag 7. What's more, the options interest for next week looks like this, where the largest call wall at 150 is less than half the size of previous weeks. This implies less resistance if there is positive pressure for stocks.\n\nTLDR: If qqq runs higher with the rest of the Mag 7 ER (META, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN), we should have a good week ahead.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fftmdutpbywd1.png?width=1642&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bf2e2d00bcc0aa416c658da0f19ad29f3f9aca4", "id": "1gc2mex", "created_utc": 1729884731.0, "score": 146, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 104, "comments": [{"body": "See, that\u2019s the thing.

For the inverted strangle, in this case, the short put is at $150. I sold them for a bit over $8, so that means if I get assigned, the net cost of those shares would be $142 roughly.\n\nNow, I sell $145 calls at the same time for $2.15 each. If those get called away, but the price is below $150, two things will happen, 1. The shares get called away, but they come back because of the short puts. The net cash gain is positive in the end despite technically coming in at  $150 per share. \n\nThat's only if I actually let things go to expiry, but as always seems to happen,  a lot can go right/wrong on the way to the expiry date. So sometimes, if there's a huge dip, and I expect a rebound, I will close out the calls, only to reopen them again at a better price. I will only do such a thing though if the surge/plunge is fast and hard and there is not much extrinsic value left in leaving it open.\nNow, if that happens, you might say, \"But you're screwed on the short puts!\" And that's true, but only if you look at snapshots in time. I look at longer timelines, and so that short put is basically a long position with flexible or changing delta value. So I view it as something I can still sell calls against it. Many times, I will sell one set of calls of equal qty  on the same date, and then some a week further out but at a higher value. They can leap frog eachother as time goes on, but the point is using around 0.80 delta worth of short puts I could sell one chunk of 0.30 delta calls against it as well as another chunk of 0.25 delta calls and I'm still delta positive if looking at the whole package.\n\nI know it seems like a lot, but I enjoy it a lot, especially on Thursdays and Fridays when the plot thickens and the climax comes to a close.\n\nI use a custom made piece of software that graphically plots all my positions and strangles etc. I use it to decide if the plan is right or not.

I made the software because it was ridiculously involved how I plot all this.\n\nIn sideways action, it's a bag of pearls and diamonds.\nIn 1% moves or less per day, it's still a gem.\n\nWhen there's more than a $4 or $5 move in a week, I need to get active and adjust whatever positions are approaching a low extrinsic value. I've let puts get as low as a $0.20 extrinsic value with 3DTE and still not get assigned, and on the call side, I'm more careful, I don't usually let them get lower than $0.25 of remaining extrinsic value.\n\nMost rolls are for decent credits, I never seem to have to \"abandon\" and cut my losses, but there are times when my confidence has been tested. In the last run down to $93 or whatever that low was, I shat my pants a few times but kept holding the long sides. My short puts were flung out as far as February on a few of them. But when things started surging, I would reel those in for gains and faster theta decay. Right now, nothing is over 90DTE. \n\nThe delta off the whole portfolio right now is just slightly less than what the delta of the shares held would be. I like to keep the total delta close to what the share delta is, but I don't mind it being at about 75%-80% either.\n\nWhen it pumps all the way to the highs it's had recently, my delta can move quickly, and the feeling of being \"net short NVDA\" is a bit unsettling.\n\nI was net short through the last earnings, and it worked out, but this time, I think it's going to be different.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Sounds like a real fun ride lol.\n\nMy strategy is simpler but also a bit of a roller coaster.\n\nI hold NVDL, and sell CCs on it.
