As the underlying stock drops and expiration approaches, that extrinsic value will drop to 0 way before the stock gets to $1... let's assume half way (3 months) the stock is trading at $100, your put would probably be valued at something like $42... since the strike is $140, you're way in the money now, so only $2 of it is extrinsic.

You gain nothing from holding this put, unless the stock goes up... little downside protection (just $2). So you'd probably exit this put... and restructure.

Here are several reasons why someone might choose to do this:\n\n### 1. **Generate Income with Lower Volatility**\n   - **ITM covered calls** provide a higher premium compared to out-of-the-money (OTM) calls because the option already has intrinsic value. \n   - If the investor wants to generate more **income immediately**, selling ITM calls is a way to do this.\n   - ITM options can offer more consistent returns with lower volatility, making it attractive for income-focused investors.\n\n### 2. **Hedging or Reducing Risk**\n   - Selling an ITM call provides **downside protection** because the premium received is higher than that from OTM calls.\n   - If the underlying stock price drops, the investor is somewhat protected by the premium earned, reducing potential losses. This is particularly useful if the investor expects the stock to **decline** or **stay flat** in the near term.\n\n### 3. **Willingness to Sell the Stock**\n   - ITM covered calls are a good strategy if the investor is willing to sell the stock at the **strike price**. Since the option has intrinsic value, it is more likely that the stock will be called away (i.e., the shares will be sold) when the option expires.\n   - Investors may use this approach when they believe the stock has reached a target price or **overvalued**, and they want to sell at a relatively **high price** while still collecting a premium.\n\n### 4. **Lower Break-Even Point**\n   - By collecting a higher premium, the break-even point for the trade is lowered. Even if the stock price declines somewhat, the premium cushions the loss.\n   - The break-even point is calculated as the purchase price of the stock minus the premium received from selling the ITM call.\n\n### 5. **Neutral to Slightly Bearish View**\n   - Investors may sell ITM covered calls when they are **neutral to slightly bearish** on the stock. They don\u2019t expect significant upside from the stock, and they\u2019re willing to sell it at the ITM strike price if the stock remains stable or drops slightly.\n\n### 6. **Managing Portfolio Risk**\n   - ITM covered calls can be used in a portfolio to manage **downside risk** while continuing to generate income. Investors often use this strategy when they\u2019re looking for a more conservative way to monetize their existing positions.\n\n---\n\n### Example Scenario:\nIf an investor owns shares of a company trading at $50 and sells an ITM covered call with a strike price of $45, they might receive a $6 premium. This provides:\n   - Immediate income.\n   - Protection if the stock drops below $50.\n   - An expected selling price of $45 + $6 = $51, higher than the current stock price.\n   - The investor is signaling that they\u2019re fine with the stock being sold if it moves above $45.\n\nWould you like to explore any of these reasons in more detail or run through specific scenarios?", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nvda"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["nvda"]}
