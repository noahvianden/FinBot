First of all the car business did great considering the EV market is seeing a downturn this year. Tesla wasn't able to get much YoY growth but they didn't sacrifice margins to keep it and that is a win. The service and energy businesses are both seeing heavy growth and are now contributing a healthy amount of profit to the overall business, if that growth can be maintained it almost doesn't matter if the car business fails to grow. The energy and service sectors could keep Tesla growing until Optimus, FSD, Dojo, or anything else Musk thinks of starts generating revenue. \n\nHowever the jump in the stock price makes it hard for me to recommend buying, but I'm not selling either. Tesla stock already has a high P/E and the massive stock price jump this week makes the P/E even higher, so the risk/reward is tipping a lot more towards risk than reward buying in at these levels. Buying at these levels needs to be based on your optimism about Tesla releasing Optimus and FSD, preferably before the competition but at least at least within a similar timeframe", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Lol so roughly .008% annualized eps return.", "score": -8, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4528859555721283}, {"body": "Detached from reality.\n\nEdit: the stock price based on the performance.", "score": -11, "replies": [{"body": "How so?

Failed R&D will have no future revenue to which an expense can be matched. Because there is no guarantee that R&D will lead to future economic benefit, instead of being capitalized as an investment it is treated as an expense in the current period.\n\nAn investment that has a reasonably defined future benefit or an \u201calternative future use\u201d can be considered capital instead of R&D. Because of the nature of technology products and services, many of the materials/equipment (like servers, infrastructure, etc) that support research and development fit this criteria, and thus the company can justify putting them on their balance sheet.

How are youva musk \"fan\"? He is a rich kid born on the home base. He DID NOT MAKE TESLA. He didn't even have the damn idea. \n\nHe was an early investor and then became CEO. Engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning started Tesla years before Elon got there. Tesla sold 90% of the EVs in the US in 23 (going off memory. Might not be exact) now they are near 50%. They lost 40% of the market segment, and it hardly makes the news. Obviously, they won't lose another 40%, but that is a huge number in 1 year. Most other companies would be freaking out. \n\nCountless broken promises. We can go there if we need to. But Elon is the hype man trying to keep the money flow, and I know how that is as a business owner. How his promises are not borderline fraud, though at this point is beyond me. I know as a much smaller business what saying things like he has said mean. I can't tell my clients I am going to have them a fully automated PowerBI dashboard for every project by the end of the month..... forever and never deliver. I would be dropped at least and  most likely sued for breach of contract. \n\nNow, on the investors call basically if you dig into it the current cars will jot be able to be fully self driving due to the technology limitations. But he promised the current cars would be able to be retrofitted. But slid into this earnings report that the current computer system is not powerful enough essentially. Sounds easy, change out the computer. We'll it's not that simple. The wiring harnesses are not the same, and the sensors are different. \n\nPeople really, really underestimate how much success is determined at birth. If you had been born with connections and money, you would be shocked at what that does alone. I was not either, so I know the struggles. \n\nBut now I have seen that side of it. I own a consulting firm, and I have been very fortunate. But the only thing stopping me right now from massive growth is capital. I spent 15 years in my industry, killing myself, working from the ground up to an executive position before going out on my own. Now, I have to carefully manage cash flow and contracts to grow. Very carefully. If I hire someone, I am footing their pay for quite a while. Which is normal. But these are multiple 6 figure jobs. So, bringing on a single employee can potentially cost the company 8k a week after withholding taxes. When you are a person like Musk or anyone else born with a silver spoon (This isn't a shot at anyone born well off. They did not choose it, and plenty of well off people are great) they don't have these issues. You can raise massive amounts of money because you already have money. It's a chicken and a egg problem. The rich have insane resources readily available to them which enable them to do things that seem just unrealistic but it's mainly because they were just there....\n\nI deal with a lot of Musks of the world. Very well off, always have been, executives.  What are you a fan of? They talk about regular people like something is kind of off with them. It's a very weird undertone. But see I'm not fully into the club because I am new money. So I really don't understand it. I'm also not nearly that rich.
