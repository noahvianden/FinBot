{"title": "How would you value Coinbase?", "selftext": "For starters, I think the difference in price and value with Coinbase stock is huge. I keep seeing it mentioned as 'cheap' because of the 30x P/E ratio. But that is way off.\n\nHere are a few key metrics showing conflicting signals:\n\n1. The stock is trading at a $40b market cap with \\~$3b in annual sales. Earnings are very volatile and cash flows are inconsistent.\n2. The business is asset-light but the custody assets are consistently growing on the balance sheet. They've gone from $2b to $200b in custody assets over five years.\n\nI know this is a momentum stock in many ways. Even though the crypto hype has slowed down, prices have doubled since last year. More money chasing fewer assets.\n\n$160 per share is rich. The stock price can get cut in half and I would still think it's expensive. But they have somehow combined 3-4 very valuable business models: a financial exchange, custody assets, software products and asset management.\n\nI don't care for the typical valuation methods. Not even comparables are applicable here. Only ICE, Nasdaq, CBOE and CMOE are similar but each has a different specialty. Even sum-of-parts would be interesting but would require constant updates. Which is useless because crypto momentum and volatility have a life of their own.\n\nTell me how you would value this stock. What would you need to see to de-risk this as an investment?\n\nP.S. Coinbase has been on my radar because of the recent regulatory progress. Their legal team is crushing it. First, they're spending \\~$20m YTD to provide more clarity for investors.

Question, can share some more details on your option strategy if you don't mind and what tickers you do it on ? Are selling Puts or Calls more? Im looking to learn some profitable ideas in a safe way as I've yet to be assigned. I have about $200k in IBKR margin account for options trading set aside.Thanks!", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The above mentioned situation is not theoretical, it's mostly real. I hold a relatively significant position in ASTS (long shares). Mind, ASTS risk profile is very different from Mag7, so it's not something you'd want to copy blindly. Also mind I'm in ASTS for 3 years now and did DD every single day since then. I really understand what I play with.\n\nThis naturally gives that I sell much more CCs than CSPs, however, I also hold cash and sell CSPs too. If I'd start with a fresh account, by all means I would stick to CSPs for as long as I can reducing my cost basis to the max before getting assigned.\n\nMy cost basis being way way below current price point allows me higher risk. I still hold high conviction in the company despite the stock price's recent move. I'm ok selling puts ATM, if premiums are that good. E.g. on 9/5 I sold 9/13 $28 puts for $3.4 in premiums which at that time were ATM. Still expired worthless tho. However, I usually settle for something with <.3 deltas.\n\nFor CCs, I sell them further away from the current price because of the same reason - I still believe further move upwards is still possible in the underlying and, while I'm ok getting assigned and taking profits, I also a) want to max those capital gains before I'm assigned b) would attempt to jump back in selling CSPs or at least collect premiums, so re-entry point is important. That leaves my CCs deltas more conservative at <.2.\n\nIn both cases I may make exceptions with the deltas if opportunity allows.\n\nI do weeklies or bi-weeklies. Depends on which one offers better returns. Often it's a combination of both.\n\nI plan my sto orders couple of days in advance and target them to high movement in the required direction days, so big red for selling puts or big green for calls. I will settle for whatever else available if I can't get a desired move during those couple of days as later theta decay will cost me more and will usually sto not later that 9-4 DTEs.\n\nI allow my position to expire worthless or btc them only at \\~90% gains. Some people do 50% or even less if they reach meaningful profitability within first days after selling. That's partly because I mostly (but not only) do ASTS and have little other ideas for wheeling where I would have the same amount of conviction in the business offering the same level of returns in premiums - no better way to employee my cash if rebought early.\n\nI'm also much more likely to btc puts as they affect my buying power. I only btc calls if challenged and theta already did its job (good net credit without rolling out).\n\nBy no means I consider myself a pro in this. But doing weeklies has a short feedback cycle and so far the feedback is ok. I'm afraid of two potential issues: a) there's some significant lose-all/most risk involved that I don't see and the party will be over when I least expect it or b) IV will settle down taking down my returns with it and my returns will revert back to normal (reality check).\n\nI'm open to learning better ways of doing this if anyone had comments.
