But we are not on any preset course,\u201d he told the National Association for Business Economics in prepared remarks. \u201cThe risks are two-sided, and we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.\u201d*\r  \n\r  \n*The remarks come less than two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee approved the half percentage point, or 50 basis point, reduction in the Fed\u2019s key overnight borrowing rate.*\r  \n\r  \n*Though markets had been largely expecting the move, it was unusual in that the Fed historically has only moved in such large increments during events such as the Covid pandemic in 2020 and the global financial crisis in 2008.*\r  \n\r  \n*Addressing the decision, Powell said it reflected policymakers\u2019 belief that it was time for a \u201crecalibration\u201d of policy that better reflected current conditions. Beginning in March 2022, the Fed began fighting surging inflation; policymakers of late have shifted their attention to a labor market that Powell characterized as \u201csolid\u201d though it has \u201cclearly cooled over the last year.\u201d*\r  \n\r  \n*\u201cThat decision reflects our growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in an environment of moderate economic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to our objective,\u201d Powell said.*\r  \n\r  \n*\u201cWe do not believe that we need to see further cooling in labor market conditions to achieve 2 percent inflation,\u201d added Powell, who gave no outward indication of where he sees the next move going.*\r  \n\r  \n*Powell\u2019s assertion that the Fed has not predetermined policy is in keeping with past statements.*\r  \n\r  \n*Futures market pricing is indicating that the Fed is more likely to move cautiously at its Nov. 6-7 meeting and approve a quarter-point reduction. However, traders see the December move as a more aggressive half-point cut.*\r  \n\r  \n*For his part, Powell expressed confidence in economic strength and sees inflation continuing to cool.*\r  \n\r  \n*Inflation during August was around 2.2% annually, according to the Fed\u2019s preferred consumer price expenditures prices index released Friday. While that is close to the central bank\u2019s 2% goal, core inflation, which excludes gas and groceries, was still running at a 2.7% pace. Policymakers usually consider core inflation as a better guide for longer-run trends being that food and energy prices are more volatile than many other items.*\r  \n\r  \n*Perhaps the most stubborn area of inflation has been housing-related costs, which rose another 0.5% in August. However, Powell said he believes the data eventually will catch up with easing prices for rent renewals.*\r  \n\r  \n*\u201cHousing services inflation continues to decline, but sluggishly,\u201d he said. \u201cThe growth rate in rents charged to new tenants remains low. As long as that remains the case, housing services inflation will continue to decline. Broader economic conditions also set the table for further disinflation.\u201d*\r  \n\r  \n*Following the speech, Powell was scheduled to sit for a question-and-answer session with Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner.*", "id": "1ft237a", "created_utc": 1727719261.0, "score": 401, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "Aaaand SP500 down half a percent in a few minutes", "score": 143, "replies": [{"body": "Can someone ELI5 the cause/effect here?
