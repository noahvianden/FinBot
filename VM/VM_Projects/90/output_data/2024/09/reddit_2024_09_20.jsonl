It has to fit within their quarterly and yearly reports in a real way that is tied to genuine numbers.\n\nI think that's where you're confused. Stock prices are speculative and \"made up\". Once you buy 1 share of a company for $3.50, you no longer have $3.50. $3.50 is not in the picture anymore. You have 1 share of a company, with a variable value. It might be worth $0.35 or $350.00 within the next 8 seconds, so your original $3.50 only exists hypothetically. The fixed value of that is \"1\". 1 share. You will need to sell the share at an amount that covers taxes in order for that $3.50 to ever exist again. If you never do that, it's permanently metamorphosized into a new value: 1 share of a company, period. In a world where you never sell that share, your $3.50 is not \"real\" anymore, and it will never exist again. Until something else happens, in units it's not 3.5 anymore, it's 1.\n\nIf you receive a $0.50 dividend while holding the share, that $0.50 *truly exists* at the exact monetary value it has, at the exact moment it is paid out. It's not speculative, it's not variable, holding it as it is does nothing to it. It is a legitimate amount of real money, subject only to inflation, taxes, and the interest rate of the account where it lands. No one in the world can \"move\" the price of this dividend without first transforming it into shares of a company, it's just flat out money being handed to you.

Hence, the price is going to decrease by a very similar margin because it is *known*. The stock price is to a large degree based on unknowns, that's why companies rarely are priced similar to their actual value. Unless, of course, a company would make zero profits tomorrow forever, then it is going to be priced based on the actual cash + equity - debt they have. And if they pay a dividend, some of that cash is reduced, which reduces the value because it is a very simple equation. Of course, there is rarely a company that will make zero profits in the future, so there are unkowns that also contribute to potential value, which is were we get closer to the stock price.
