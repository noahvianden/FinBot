{"title": "Apple must pay 13 billion euros in back taxes, EU\u2019s top court rules", "selftext": "Apple has been dealt a significant blow as Europe's top court ruled that the company must pay 13 billion euros ($14.4 billion) in back taxes, concluding a decade-long legal dispute over its tax practices in Ireland. This case stems from a 2016 decision by the European Commission, which claimed that Apple received \u201cillegal\u201d tax benefits from Ireland for over 20 years, allowing the tech giant to dramatically reduce its tax bill.\n\nTuesday\u2019s ruling by the European Court of Justice reverses a 2020 decision that had favored Apple, upholding the Commission\u2019s original verdict. The Irish government, which has always denied giving preferential tax treatment to Apple, acknowledged that this case is now of \"historical relevance\" and will soon begin transferring the funds held in escrow to Ireland.\n\nThis ruling is part of a broader campaign by the European Union to regulate U.S. tech companies, who have faced increasing scrutiny over tax avoidance, data protection, and market dominance. Beyond this case, Apple has also been hit with a 1.8 billion euro antitrust fine earlier this year and is facing further investigations under the EU\u2019s new Digital Markets Act.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/apple-loses-eu-court-battle-over-13-billion-euro-tax-bill-in-ireland.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/apple-loses-eu-court-battle-over-13-billion-euro-tax-bill-in-ireland.html)", "id": "1fdenrd", "created_utc": 1725964387.0, "score": 285, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "Apple set aside this money back in 2018, so it will make no impact on financials going forward.\n\nhttps://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/09/10/apples-13bn-irish-tax-case-timeline/\n\n>September 2018: Government concludes provisional collection of \u20ac14.3 billion from Apple, including interest, with the amount put into escrow pending outcome of litigation surrounding the case.", "score": 54, "replies": [{"body": "I wonder if they made money off of this by putting it into an interest generating account.  $13 billion over 6 years\u2026 if it was sitting in a 5% money market account, it would be worth almost $18 billion now", "score": 7, "replies": [{"body": "You wouldn\u2019t get 5% six years ago.", "score": 17, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19406841695308685}, {"body": "Yes, but often interest is due.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "What does this mean", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "If judge decides it, you need to pay what you are sentenced to, plus legal interest.
