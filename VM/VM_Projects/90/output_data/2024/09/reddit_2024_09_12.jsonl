{"title": "Henrik Zeberg: S&P500 to decline to 1800 in a few years", "selftext": "Henrik Zeberg has argued that the stock market is in for a massive decline in the coming years. He expects a blow off top to happen in the coming months with the S&P500 reaching 6100 to 6300, and then to go down sharply. There will be a deep recession and the FED will do QE again in a big way, leading to a big bounce in the economy and the stock market. But then inflation will tick up again and the stock market will start to slide down. He then expects the S&P500 to bottom out at around 1800 in a few years from now. \n\nI think this sort of a scenario is very plausible. The stock market is enormously overvalued, it has gone up a lot relative to the economy via multiple expansion. Traders are mostly making realized profits off the losses of their fellow traders, the inflows from the real economy are very low. The value of the portfolios of investors is mostly just unrealizable phantom wealth. \n\nIt's as if you have a big insolvent bank whose clients are happy to put their money in a savings account with that bank, because they don't believe the bank is insolvent and the bank pays every account holder 10% interest per year. The bank doesn't have that money, it just issues account statements displaying the 10% interest payment, \n\nThe wise thing to do if you have an account at such a bank, is to pull your money out before it is too late. And given that the bank is insolvent, it's als a given that only a fraction of the account holders will ever be able to pull their money out.
