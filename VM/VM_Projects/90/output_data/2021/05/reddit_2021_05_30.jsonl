{"title": "Made another WSB sentiment analyzing bot (I used machine learning) -- 33% annual return ($16k). Source code and explanation below!", "selftext": "So a few days ago someone made a sentiment analyzing bot for this sub and as a programmer myself, I thought I\u2019d try my hand! For those of you that want to poke around or use this for yourself, \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: here\u2019s my [source code](https://github.com/tstewart161/Reddit_Sentiment_Trader)\n\nEdit: [Hosted version](https://getquantbase.com/) (how to actually run/invest in it). Folks the amount of y\u2019all that have messaged me asking for this is absolutely AMAZING but I can\u2019t keep up! Posting the link here for you guys\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**HOW I DID THIS:** Scraped WSB sentiment, got the top + most positively mentioned stocks on WSB (for the better part of this year, that's been $GME and $AMC, recently some $SPCE and $NVDA, and about 6 other stocks -- I could do more but the relevance drops off typically after this. I have the strategy rebalancing monthly. The source code is actually pretty intuitive for a beginner/intermediate programmer, but essentially what it uses is VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning), which is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion.\n\n**HOW THIS WORKS:** The way it works is by relying on a dictionary that maps lexical (aka word-based) features to emotion intensities -- these are known as sentiment scores. The overall sentiment score of a comment/post is achieved by summing up the intensity of each word in the text.\n\nIn some ways, it's easy: words like \u2018love\u2019, \u2018enjoy\u2019, \u2018happy\u2019, \u2018like\u2019 all convey a positive sentiment. Also VADER is smart enough to understand the basic context of these words, such as \u201cdid not love\u201d as a negative statement. It also understands the emphasis of capitalization and punctuation, such as \u201cENJOY\u201d which is pretty cool. Phrases like \u201cThe acting was good , but the movie could have been better\u201d have sentiments in both polarities, which makes this kind of analysis tricky -- essentially w VADER you would analyze which part of the sentiment here is more intense.\n\n**Results and some stats:** Right now I'm up 60% YTD, compared to the SP500's 13% (the recent spikes in GME and AMC have helped tremendously)\n\n\\- The strategy is backtested only to the beginning of 2020, but I'm working on it. It's got an annualized return of 33% (compared to 16% for the SP500)\n\n\\- Max drawdown of -8.7% (aka how far it went down before coming back up -- interestingly enough, WallStreetBets weathered COVID pretty well)\n\nHappy to answer any more questions about the process/results.

The only reason to use a more sophisticated algorithm is to improve accuracy, but there are two fundamental problems with the proposed solution. One is inherent to the hypothesis that sentiment is a proxy for price action. I believe that was true, that's why I built an algorithm. This turns out to be partially true. The basic correlation analysis (Kendall's Tau) revealed that the ticker mentions correlate to the volume, however volume does not correlate to the positive price action. The second problem is the time scale of the algorithm. Because of my day job I cannot do intra-day trading, so I choose daily predictions. Unfortunately, the algorithm becomes almost descriptive (reactionary) than predictive. Yes you can find all the great stocks a day later, but that doesn't help since MM already starts their counter move the next day. There's probably a third and more nuanced issue, which is related to natural language processing. When someone mentions a ticker, say GME,  in a positive way, it follows with lots rocket emojis and \"i love the stonk\" or \"that is the way\". Your algorithm needs to be sophisticated enough to understand stonk==GME. That's why you need transformers with a sufficient beam length (sorry for the technical jargon).
