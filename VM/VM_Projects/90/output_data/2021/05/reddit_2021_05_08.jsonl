{"title": "Blackrock Buys 2 MILLION SHARES OF CLOV", "selftext": "\n\nAccording to FINTEL, Blackrock recently bought 2,078,899 shares. \n\nhttps://fintel.io/so/us/clov\n\nScroll down to the 13 F filings.\n\nI will first say that I am NEW to trading so take my opinion cautiously and do your own DD. I am NEW compared to the 100 year old WSB OGs. This is my disclaimer.\n\nI am not confident enough to write DD but Im working on it. One thing I do know is whenever I follow Blackrocks moves, I make green sometimes sooner sometimes later. Blackrock is SMART MONEY, so I am drawn to their moves for validation. Blackrock usually plays a long game to sell when they are comfortable with the profit margin; this is not exactly breaking news. I was first hesitant with CLOV because of the legal investigation but that appears to be losing muster.\n\nI have $10 Calls and $11 Calls for 06/18 and will start adding shares on Monday . I am looking at Jan 2022 CALLS to give me longer term perspective on this stock.\n\nThe SI % of float has reached 43.48%\n\nAs always, feel free to hammer my opinion as I am all ears. Maybe you are smarter than Blackrock ? This is not DD and I am no where near a financial advisor.", "id": "n7ji2a", "created_utc": 1620457203.0, "score": 116, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 40, "replies": [{"body": "Go on..", "score": 10, "replies": [{"body": "Hide your kids, hide your wife", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0829671323299408}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.26023998856544495}, {"body": "And?...", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24524390697479248}, {"body": "Sounds pretty fuckin bullish", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07987809926271439}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08302817493677139}, {"body": "You have no idea how CLOV fits into any Blackrock portfolios.
