First thing you\u2019ll notice is the support at $62. After breaching $62 in June, it tested that support on 10/30, 3/5, 3/24 and is very close to testing it again. It has also been consolidating (w/ very low volume) since end of February with lower and lower highs. What this tells us is there are machines or people who buy at that $62 resistance line, but not much enthusiasm to keep buying.\n\nNext, I look at what happened prior to the stock breaching $62 back in June. There was a consolidation between $43-$48 in early June. That means support at $43 and resistance at $48. After it breached $48, it freely ran up above $62. That means there are no reference points for algorithms to start buying at, so chances are they will wait for it to get back to $43-$48. Furthermore, you can look at a VolumeProfile study (on ThinkorSwim) and see there is extremely low volume between $48-60. Again, it provides no reference point to trigger algos to buy.\n\nSomething to keep in mind with chart reading. It\u2019s not necessarily predicting what the stock is going to do, but rather how algos and HVT will react to price movements.
