So my high yield savings account makes nothing anymore. \n\nFirst trade was BS - BearsStern after JPM announced the take over at 10 per share. Second trade was LEH.

By expert I mean I have nothing better to do that watch and read market news blogs etc. everyday I got my Schwab trading platform up on my second screen picking the next big stock. I was relatively flat and way underperforming a simple SPY(VOO). After 2014 I stopped looking and went 90% funds and ETFs. I had to because I started working for a real investment firm and I need to preclear all my stock trades. For my 10% stocks...I do semi annual rebalance to buy or sell. That has greatly helped the performance compared to when I was actively trading. \n\n\nMistakes I learned: \n* don\u2019t trust business news when they make recommendations. The experts that makes them don\u2019t actually always believe it. Sometimes the show producer ask if they can make a case. \n* we always end up holding losers longer than we should and sell winners earlier than we should. - new rule 50% loss triggers an exit. Winners stay until the signals goes negative  \n* figuring out how much to buy is just as hard - I started applying a risk control to the stocks.  I would split 10,000 to 4 sectors. Then buy them based on market cap. So large cap gets a higher weight within my 25,000 sector. \n\nHow I am handling the recent drops? I sleep like a baby.

My Ford stock is still under water and I keep it as a reminder. Yes, there is such a thing as being too far ahead of the game. I've also learned to sell the cycles with 'cyclical stocks' such as automotive and oil. They go up 100%, then eventually go back down 50% (to the same price where you bought in) then they go back up. Holding long-term can get you absolutely nothing over the long term. And there is no reason you need to sell 100% of your shares in any company. Not a bad idea to keep some shares, maybe 5-25%. I sold out of AAPL, AMZN, PCLN etc. back when they were almost penny stocks. Sure, I sold out of some companies before they went bankrupt, but you can only lose 100% of your position.
