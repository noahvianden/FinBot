For example if the strike is $10 and the stock price is $22 he has income on 22-10=12.\n\nTwo things to keep in mind... One, he has to come up with the $10 per share, which he can simply get via selling enough shares to cover the $10 cost and two, he needs enough money to pay tax on the $12 income, which may force him to sell another large chunk of those shares.\n\nIf his plan is to hold the shares, then to the extent he does not need funds to cover the strike price it is beneficial for him for the share price to be lower as his tax burden is less. BUT, as he needs money to cover that strike, obviously a higher price might be better.\n\nGoing back to my example above, if he exercised 100 shares worth, he would need $1,000 to cover the strike, which at $22 per share would be about 45 shares. In addition to cover taxes (assuming 40% x $1,200 = $480) he would need to sell another 22 shares, leaving him with 33 shares net. If the share price instead was $15, then he would need to sell 67 shares to cover the strike and the tax (40% x $500 = $200) would need another 13 shares, netting him with 20 shares. Bottom line, he benefits from the stock price being up if he needs to cover the strike price.\n\nThis is all forced activity as the alternative may be to lose the money.\n\nNot sure how my explanation plays into your thesis but it is what it is.\n\nI am bullish on PLTR.", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Only 1 thing wrong with your comment: Karps shares cost him like, $5 for 100 shares.
