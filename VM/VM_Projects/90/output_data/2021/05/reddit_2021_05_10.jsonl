{"title": "Gevo future great company can fly ahead", "selftext": "$GEVO Gevo Inc (NASDAQ: GEVO) has been an interesting stock to watch as of late. After a massive pop earlier this year, the stock has been tapering off its gains. However, if you\u2019re thinking about betting against the company, you\u2019re missing out on a huge opportunity. \n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know:\n\nWhat Is Gevo?\nGevo is a clean energy company, but not the traditional clean energy company that you think about when you think about the space. The company has no interest in producing solar panels wind turbines. There\u2019s no interest in generating electricity either. \nInstead, the company is focused on replacing fossil fuels with renewable fuels. \nTo do so, Gevo has spent years developing and perfecting a process to turn renewable feedstocks like waste wood and other things we would consider to be garbage, into isobutanol. This isobutanol is then used to develop aviation and offroad fuels. \n\nIn fact, Gevo fuels are already being used in commercial aircraft. \n\nHowever, with a recent announcement from the company, we learned that it\u2019s not only looking at the transportation sector as an opportunity, it\u2019s looking into natural gas for the heating of homes and other uses. \nPresident Joe Biden and his cohorts in Washington D.C. have long been proponents of clean energy, and considering their control over the nation\u2019s capital, big changes are likely coming down the line in the United States energy and transportation sectors. \nAt the moment, investors are focusing on those creating solar panels or setting up wind energy farms. On the transportation side, it\u2019s all about electric vehicles, but that won\u2019t be the end all be all.  There will be significant demand for clean, renewable fuels.\nFor example, I live in a rural area where an electric vehicle simply doesn\u2019t make sense. In my area, if I had an electric vehicle, the only place I would be able to charge it is at home. If I wanted to take a long distance trip, I would have absolutely no place to charge my vehicle when the batteries started to die, and would be forced to tow my vehicle home. \nThat\u2019s not the only issue with EVs either. \nUltimately, filling a line of batteries takes quite a bit more time than filling a gas tank. Who wants to wait hours to be able to drive their vehicle? Sure, EVs are fun, and popular at that, but they aren\u2019t practical for everyone. As a result, renewable fuels will become increasingly important, and in the renewable, clean-burning fuels game, there\u2019s no other company that has even gotten close to the accomplishments of Gevo. \nIn fact, Gevo recently announced a renewable natural gas project, and that it has issued bonds to fund the project. With the renewable natural gas product, the company will be extracting natural gas from cow manure, resulting in yet another renewable product. \n\nThe Market Has Gone Short\n\nAfter sending the stock screaming for the top earlier this year, the stock market seems to have gone short on the stock. In fact, at the moment, the stock trades with short interest of more than 20%. \n\nSo, why have investors gone short?\n\nWell, there\u2019s a bit to it. Gevo is in a growth stage, which is a painful reality for many. The company has signed agreements surrounding the sale of billions of dollars worth of its sustainable aviation fuel. However, to meet the demand set forth by those agreements, the company is having to spend massive amounts of money to build out its infrastructure. \n\nThe big spending at the company is ultimately leading to losses, which is scaring investors; but that\u2019s not always a bad thing. \nTake a look at the early days of Amazon.com. Everyone said Jeff Bezos was a lunatic on a spending spree as he built out his infrastructure to become the leading force in the e-commerce space. When Bezos\u2019 goals came to fruition, there were plenty of people with feet in their mouths. \n\nThat\u2019s likely to be the case for Gevo. \n\nYes, the company is spending money by the wheel barrel full, but that spending is a necessary evil, and will set the stage for tremendous growth ahead. \nAs the members of the Wall Street Bets Reddit have proven, retail investors are getting tired of hedge funds playing with the market at their expense, and are starting to fight back. Well, I\u2019m expecting a war to be waged in the relatively near term surrounding GEVO that could send the stock for gains in multiples.", "id": "n9cdus", "created_utc": 1620671501.0, "score": 154, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 88, "comments": [{"body": "This company have a huge future potential, Its a climate savior.

The green diesel can also be made from fusel oils, a mixture of several alcohols produced as a by-product of fermentation.\n\nRenewable diesel is expected to compete head-to-head on price with natural and petroleum-based equivalents, while reducing particulates and CO2 emissions, according to Gevo\u2019s CEO Patrick R Gruber.\n\nLow-carbon fuels reduce the carbon intensity, or the level of greenhouse gas emissions, compared to standard fossil-based fuels across their lifecycle.\n\nDemand has increased since California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard came into effect, which is designed to decrease the carbon intensity of California\u2019s transportation fuel pool and provide an increasing range of low-carbon and renewable alternatives, which reduce petroleum dependency and achieve air quality benefits.\n\nIn addition to serving the low-carbon fuel markets, Gevo\u2019s technology can also serve markets for the production of chemical intermediate products for solvents, plastics, and building block chemicals.\n\nThe group's stated strategy is to commercialize bio-based alternatives to petroleum-based products to allow for the optimization of fermentation facilities\u2019 assets, with the ultimate goal of maximizing cash flows from the operation of those assets.\n\nHow it is doing:\n\nGevo kicked off 2021 by announcing to shareholders and other potential investors that it has about $535 million in cash and no significant debt.\n\nThe money will help the company launch its Net Zero Projects to produce energy-dense liquid hydrocarbons using renewable energy and Gevo\u2019s proprietary technology. Gevo is currently developing its Net-Zero 1 Project at Lake Preston, South Dakota and other Net-Zero projects are planned. \n\nThe company expects the Net-Zero 1 project will have the capability to produce around 45MGPY of liquid hydrocarbons (jet fuel and renewable gasoline) that when burned, should have a \u201cnet-zero\u201d greenhouse gas footprint. In addition, the Net-Zero 1 plant is expected to produce at least 350,000,000 lbs per year of high-protein animal feed. \n\nGevo, which is working with Citigroup, said preliminary capital estimates for Net-Zero 1 are $700 million-$800 million (including on-site renewable energy generation). The company is in the process of completing front-end engineering and project planning to determine capital costs for Net-Zero 1 with more precision.\n\nIn addition, the company plans to begin the construction of its first RNG (renewable natural gas) project in 2021. It will produce RNG by using anaerobic digesters to convert manure from dairy cows into RNG, with production expected to begin in 2022. Gevo plans to sell most of the gas to the RNG market in California and use some of the bio-gas generated from this project at its renewable hydrocarbons plant, for example, at Lake Preston. \n\nFor its first major deal of the new year, Gevo in February struck an expanded fuel sales agreement with Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS). Under the deal now valued at $100 million, SAS will increase its minimum purchase obligation for Gevo\u2019s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 5 million gallons annually.  Gevo expects to supply SAS with SAF starting in 2024, from its Net-Zero 2 Project for the use and distribution in low carbon fuel regions of the US. Gevo and SAS signed the original agreement in October 2019. \n\nIn addition to SAS, Gevo has closed several other fuel-supply contracts - with Delta Air Lines Inc as well as a deal to supply its SAF to the aviation industry in the Pacific Northwest, by way of its customer and global fuel supplier, Avfuel Corporation.\n\nGevo also won recently the largest contract in its history after entering into a binding agreement with Trafigura Trading LLC, one of the world\u2019s leading independent commodity trading companies. The contract increases the company revenue pipeline to more than $1.5 billion.\n\nUnder the 10-year deal, Gevo will deliver 48 million gallons/year (MPGY) of renewable hydrocarbons, the majority of which is expected to be low-carbon premium gasoline with a smaller portion of the volume for SAF, starting in 2023. Trafigura hopes to supply SAF to both US and international customers interested in low-carbon jet fuel.\n\nLooking outside the US, the company has been awarded part of The Queensland Waste to Biofutures (W2B) Fund to support the development of waste-to-biofutures projects in Australia's second-largest state.\n\nAnd Gevo recently increased its footprint in India via a technology-licensing deal with bio-based technologies and engineering firm Praj Industries Ltd to commercialize low carbon SAF and renewable premium gasoline in the South Asian nation and neighboring countries. The company is currently working with the Indian Air Force on fuel tests.\n\nOn March 17, Gevo reported its 4Q 2020 results that showed the company finished the three-month period to end December 31, 2020, with nearly $78.3 million in cash and equivalents. \n\nRevenue for the quarter was $0.5 million compared with $6.9 million in the same period in 2019 as a result of the suspension of ethanol production due to coronavirus (COVID-19) and an \u201cunfavourable commodity environment,\u201d according to the company.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0781993567943573}, {"body": "Inflection points:\n\nBegin construction on first RNG project in 2021\nExpect RNG production to begin in 2022\nAnticipate financing on Net-Zero 1 project to close in 2H 2022\nAdvance SAF commercialization in South Asia\nWhat the boss says:\n\nCommenting on the outlook for 2021, Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber told shareholders: \u201cNet-Zero 1 is a first of a kind, off-the-grid type of plant where we are putting great effort into making Net-Zero 1 the most sustainable plant it can be.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m glad we have the customers secured, Citigroup to help us with the debt financing, and that the economics of Net-Zero 1 are attractive at this stage.
