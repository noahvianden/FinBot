The amount of middle class or lower income people that are able to afford a new car is very lower compared to the upper middle class and higher incomes. Further, hybrids and EVs have almost always been more expensive than comparable sized ICE cars and the cost savings for a middle class family with kids has never worked out in favor of the hybrid or EV in less than 5 years or at all when I\u2019ve ran the numbers.\n\nThe EV tax credit phased out after 200k vehicles were sold in quarterly increments. I think Tesla maximized this and maybe pushed it over 250k or 300k vehicles (don\u2019t quote me as I\u2019m not willing to look this up but they were at setting new record production rates during those phase out quarters and have been generally since.\n\nEither way, just stick with 200k cars at 7500 rebate and that alone is $1.5B in credits per manufacturer that was primarily given to people that could afford a brand new car and a lot of them luxury Model X and Model S cars. I\u2019d argue that on a price basis that the super low cost $35k Model 3 is at least semi-luxury 5 years argue when a new Ford Focus, Chevy Cruze or Toyota Corolla could be had for far less and maybe half.\n\nEV tax credits financially hurt the lower incomes in addition to providing them no direct financial benefit. Let\u2019s just say that all the Hybrid, EV and Solar tax credits already approved cost the average median income family $50. This $50 represents a far higher % of their discretionary income than whatever the cost is to upper middle class incomes.

The current situation is like a family with a monthly income of $1000, mortgage, car payment and monthly expenditures of $1100/month. Ratio is too low I know but I\u2019m keeping this simple. Then that person gets a raise of $50/month and so immediately going and buying something that costs $45/month. They are still spending $1145/month while only bringing in $1050/month.

The average is over $1T deficit. So, the cost as a percent of revenue is at least 25%. That\u2019s just seems way to high and unsustainable. I worry it will eventually cause severe austerity like Europe had to deal with (and I heard some reports it may be returning to in another year or so) and make a response like we had for the pandemic not sustainable without massive hardship on the average American. I think of what I read about the 70s stagflation as the hardship for the average American.
