{"title": "Huge potential for BNTX: about to beat earnings again plus new data on cancer trials upcoming", "selftext": "I want to give you some insight on BioNTech (NASDAQ: BNTX), a German biotechnology company that - especially in the US - often stays in the shadow behind Pfizer when speaking about Covid vaccines. Currently trading at about $295, I am super bullish for this company, both in the short-term as well as long.\n\nLooking at the chart, BNTX just finished its consolidation and is now back in a uptrend. When the resistances at $300 and $330 are broken (300 probably today), there's a lot upside potential as two major catalysts are approaching next week: Q3 ER and its participation at a oncology congress. Let's look at the two separately, as well as an outlook.\n\n\\-- As usually: I am by no means a financial expert, please do your own DD. --\n\n**Q3 ER**  \nIn the last quarters, BioNTech showed a pattern of crushing it's earnings estimations and after Pfizer topped its estimations significantly yesterday, so will BioNTech as they share profits 50:50. As a result, alone from this we could/should get close to the ATH of $464 (reached shortly after the great Q2 ER) until ER on Nov 9. But this is not a short-term exaggeration if you look at the fundamentals: The market cap is currently at about $66B with the **currently** estimated EPS of $42 in 2021 and about the same for 2022 ([source](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BNTX/analysis/?guccounter=1)). This leads to a current price-earnings ratio of only 7 while the competitor Moderna (ticker: MRNA) is at 12 ([source](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mrna/price-earnings-peg-ratios)). For BNTX, a value of 12 would mean a share price of $500 and this doesn't even take into account BioNTech's better pipeline (see below)!\n\n**Presentations at 36th SITC Annual Meeting (oncology congress)**  \nCovid is obviously a major topic and will continue to be but some criticize that BNTX's vaccine is the only product they have on the market currently. Some background on the company: originally, BNTX was founded with the aim to fight cancer using mRNA technology, the Covid vaccine was more of a side product by utilization of the deep knowledge they had gained in this area over time. Thus progress in their oncology programs would be a big win, both for humanity as well as for the share price. On October 1, BNTX announced that they will be presenting new data on four of their oncology programs at the SITC Annual Meeting November 10 - 14, including a phase 1/2 in-human study of a drug that led to cure from cancer in 60 & of the observed mice ([source](https://immuno-oncologynews.com/2020/01/08/biontechs-car-t-cell-therapy-accompanying-vaccine-show-high-anti-tumor-activity-solid-tumors-mouse-study/))! Furthermore they say \"*The data we will be presenting at SITC 2021 is indicative of our continued pursuit of pathbreaking science and the development of our  platform technologies that tailor anti-cancer therapies to individual patient needs,\u201d said \u00d6zlem T\u00fcreci, M.D., Co-Founder and Chief Medical Officer at BioNTech. \u201cWe are encouraged by the considerable progress within our oncology portfolio seeing multiple programs now coming to fruition. They represent critical steps for us towards bringing cancer immunotherapy into the next generation and we are looking forward to sharing the data with the scientific community at a key conference.*\u201d ([source](https://investors.biontech.de/news-releases/news-release-details/biontech-present-new-clinical-and-preclinical-data-across))  \nTo me, it's hard to miss the excitement between the lines - \"encouraged by the considerable progress\", \"coming to fruition\", \"looking forward to sharing the data\", ... Also, I don't think they would be participating if the data wasn't good.  \nGood news in this matter just days after beating earnings estimations and on top of a possible ATH (or close to it) would blow all boundaries, I think. And that's without the shorts that will be grilled on the way. However, I don't like the excessive use of rocket emojis, so I'll spare them here.\n\n**Long-term outlook**  \nBeyond all this short-term excitement, BNTX is also a great hold for the long-term future. U\u011fur \u015eahin, BioNTech' CEO, when asked about the future of mRNA pharmaceuticals, explained: \"*The first approved products are already here. The next drug could come in the next year and a half. Then, two or three more will arrive, then five, then 10. And then it will skyrocket. I predict that in 15 years, one-third of all newly approved drugs will be based on mRNA technology.*\" ([source](https://www.spiegel.de/international/business/biontech-ceo-ugur-sahin-on-mrna-technology-we-have-opened-the-door-to-a-new-world-of-pharmaceuticals-a-2d732976-8796-4305-88b8-5a0fb915f553)) The massive profits due to the Covid vaccine success lead to huge possibilities for more R&D projects and I am convinced this will allow BNTX to expand its position as the current and future market leader dramatically.", "id": "qltdr6", "created_utc": 1635942569.0, "score": 83, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "I wrote a very similar [dd](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qlbvwn/bntx_could_be_an_amazing_play_in_the_next_23_weeks/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) yesterday.

{"title": "HIMX will 2.5x", "selftext": "Calling all deep value investors and retards who just want to scroll to the bottom for which strikes to get. This is not a squeeze on the underlying but rather a squeeze on your portfolio balance. \n\nAlright, hear me out. I didn\u2019t even know there were already HIMX posts until after this was written. Enjoy it anyway. \n\nHopefully we haven\u2019t forgotten that we want to own companies that are profitable as fuck. I believe this play presents an asymmetric risk. HIMX is trading at 8.6 PE while competitors are trading at 28.57 PE. Fair market value is $25 based on multiples alone. 174.3m free float. Decent amount of SI (26.6m shares sold short) and 99.4% utilization. CTB fee rising. They also are a healthy company that produces a dividend. If a dividend is too boomer for you it\u2019s because you\u2019re poor and I\u2019m trying to help change that about you so pay attention.\n\nWhat do they do: Himax Technologies, Inc., a fabless semiconductor company, provides display imaging processing technologies in China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Korea, Japan, Europe, and the United States. The company operates through two segments, Driver IC and Non-Driver Products. It offers display driver integrated circuits (ICs) and timing controllers that are used in televisions, laptops, monitors, mobile phones, tablets, automotive, digital cameras, car navigation, virtual reality devices, and other consumer electronic devices.\n\nThe opportunity for additional upside here is that Himax has their hands on the future with virtual reality devices. They have MetaVerse exposure. This is lagging hard compared to other tickers who have recently exploded, and those tickers aren\u2019t even profitable. FB is expecting to spend in excess of $170bln over the next decade making the metaverse possible. \n\nApple is producing its first headset as well - \u201ca mixed reality experience that can handle games in high quality virtual reality with snappy chips and high end displays.\u201d\n\nThink: Ready Player One\n\nBig tech is investing big money into this space and whether we lack the vision for it or not, it\u2019s happening. They\u2019ve already created new position titles at their respected companies to get ahead of this curve. Source: trust me bro. This space is going to create an even higher demand for semi conductor companies let alone those who produce micro displays. We are entering the next evolution of the internet.\n\nBut don\u2019t just listen to me, Fintel claims HIMX to be undervalued and have a high ranking for the company. 90.04 score in their quality metric and 77.9 in value. Recent articles suggest it\u2019s one of the few Taiwanese tickers to own, presenting value and growth. \n\n\nFinancials:\n\n\u201cFor the third quarter, the Company expects further revenue growth from the already high level of Q2 2021. Gross margin shall see another uptick and could reach another quarterly high. With the increases of both revenue and margin, Himax anticipates net profit shall increase substantially in the third quarter.\u201d Massive flex, ok.\n\nThird quarter projections: the company is expecting net revenues to increase 13-17%. \n\nPositions cost distribution: \n26% shareholders are profitable. Sitting on top of a volume shelf looking to move up. 12.3 and 13.94 are the next two largest areas of supply. \n\nQ2 Total Revenue: 365.26m up 95.43% YoY. \nQ2 Net Income: 108.89 an 7,773.54% increase YoY.\nEPS: .62 which is 7,690.00% YoY. The median for its sector is .47. \nROE: 18.68% which is 5,737.00% YoY. The Semiconductor sector median is 2.79%. \n\nThose numbers are so good you\u2019d think I was tripping on acid. Fact check it. Me being high as balls right now has nothing to do with it. Fuckin seahorse sea hell.\n\nTotal debt: HIMX has $159.5m in debt, which is down from $222.4m reported a year ago. They also have $270.4m in cash to offset the debt. This leaves the company $110.9m in net cash. \n\nCash flow: 89% of its EBIT \n\nDividend: .262\nDividend Yield: 2.53%\n\nTechnicals: found hard support at $9.6 and is testing its daily resistance of $11.32. A daily close above this price would present a pivot point. Key areas of resistance past this point would be $14.61 and volume shelf where bag-holders lie waiting, although not many. Institutions are holding at higher prices. \n\nMACD has crossed, bands are squeezing - haven\u2019t been this tight since your mom birthed you crotch goblins. We also have a 9EMA/21MA crossover signaling bullish trend reversal. \n\nOptions: call activity has been bullish recently. Recent sweepers into the 11/19 12c. \n\n**TLDR: future proof conductor company prints hard as fuck right now and in the future. Jan 8c 2022 / 30c 2023 buys you lambo equipped with HIMX shit.**\n\nER Thursday before the bell. I don\u2019t want you to get IV crushed but do your thing. I have shares, Jan 8c 2022 and Jan 30c 2023, with intentions of exercising. \n\nFor transparency, this is 15% of the weight of my portfolio and I\u2019m green 11%.
