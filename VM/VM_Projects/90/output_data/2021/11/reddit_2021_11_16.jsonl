I convinced him to rotate that position into Amd and the best way to do that was xlnx based on price ratio of the two. He was able to get out at 57. He made 18.75% holding a stock for two years during one of the most historic bull runs ever and even an order of magnitude more historic for semiconductor stocks. He rotated all of it into xlnx at 120 and in a few months is up 79%.

Lets look at this way every single this year this \u201cdead company\u201d has increased revenue every year and maintained over 20 billion dollars in earnings in the last few years. According to Reddit they are not doing fine but according to their financials they are very healthy.\n\nAlso on the front of competition Reddit seems to have this mentality that if you are not best in your field and don\u2019t make the best products you are not going to succeed as a business. Especially involving a field thats in extremely high demand right now and only increasing in demand so much so that there is a massive shortage. You don\u2019t need to be the best to be a successful business. Look at all the computer companies Microsoft, Apple, Google, Dell, Samsung, Toshiba, Acer, HP, and more are all in competition with each other. Microsoft arguably makes the best computers so I guess according to Reddit all the other companies are crap because they make inferior products. They are successful despite some of them being behind in the technology because computers are such a high demand item so they are all able to coexist. Its the same situation with semi conductors\n\nLike I said Intel is fine overall they just got a new CEO and are expanding their business with no segments like foundries and mobileye. Right now Reddit is riding the AMD and NVDA high because their stocks have shot up substantially. \n\nJust remember stock price is separate from business and in the short term the Market is a voting machine and long term its a weighing machine. Jeff Bezos said something really well when Amazon fell from around $90.00 to around $7.00 a share during 2001 he said \"I liked our business, and I liked the fundamentals of our business, but I also knew that the stock price was disconnected from what we were doing on a day-to-day basis\u201d also \"I said, look, when the stock is up 30% in a month, don't feel 30% smarter, because when it's down 30% in a month, then you're gonna have to feel 30% dumber, and it's not gonna feel as good\u201d.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "I think the issue is the main support that these pro intel investing posts get is from gamers. PCs dominated semiconductor sale since the beginning and gaming hardware always had the highest margins. For a long time being a gamer meant you had a pulse on the semiconductor industry.

Their only products that will compete in the aforementioned space will be ones they pay their largest competitor to make.
