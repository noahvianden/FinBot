{"title": "$GOEV - The Bull Case of Canoo Inc. AKA Hypermasculine BubbleTruk AKA CyberTruck -on-Notice AKA This Scares the F150. (#7 - Weekend Trend Reversal Edition)", "selftext": "Good Morning and Welcome to Weekend Edition[.](https://u.teknik.io/nkXjb.PNG)\n\nThe music for today's post is **Gosh** by **Jaime XX**.  Put it on.\n\nI'm your host Brother Luminous and **I want to start this out by saying I'm not a professional, I am not giving financial advice and well you shouldn't listen to anything I say.  Please let me know if I am wrong. I can take it.**\n\nI am so fucking balls deep in this ticker.\n\n* 66 3/19 17.5c\n* 44 4/16 17.5c\n* 46 4/16 15c\n* 57 4/16 30c\n* **LFG**\n\n**Canoo Inc. AKA $GOEV** is an EV automaker whose claim to fame is developing a highly customizable electric skateboard chassis allowing it to quickly adapt vehicle designs to specific applications with a high degree of customizability. They seek to break the mold by pushing design boundaries while maximizing utility and advancing new concepts in vehicle ownership through subscription based models of vehicle financing and fleet management.  Canoo Inc also excels at punishing the visionary longs as you must wait for 3 months outside the temple of Zen before they let you in **No more suffering GOEV only tendies and gainz posting now.**\n\n# Trend Reversal = No More Dryspell\n\nRecently SPACS and EVs fell out of favor as macro market headwinds took the air out of Tech and Growth sails.  With a large amount of EV's being suspected of being Vaporware including the Pink Elephant in the room TSLA, Capital ran from these stocks faster than your Sunday morning retreat from that pig shaped MOPED you don't want your friends to see you riding.  This all came back to a stunning reversal of fortune after Warren Buffet said Yield Curve is so 1920's and everything is fine, stop being a bitch.  FED said QE forever boys and I'll let you know when I stop buying mortgages people haven't paid for since the pandemic started. Cool Bro, so Last week we saw capital come back to growth and tech stocks acting like nothing happened because they have a nice personality and tend to bang well. You know what I'm mean.\n\nThis saw our beloved GOEV take its gloves off (and its pants) and fight like it had a pair.  There's a short squeeze taking place that I have written about extensively.  The stock price immediately reversed its course and has continued to appreciate dramatically based on the electric magnetism of a gamma ramp. Friday the empire struck back and then we gave everyone fuck tons of free money. BullHood and his best friend WeRobbin' is going to turn this market into Burning Man meets 28 days later. Strap in.\n\nFor real though Canoo spent this week as the darling of the EV class.  Not only did its [SP](https://u.teknik.io/nkXjb.PNG) outperform every other fucking EV maker out there. If there wasn't the Friday Short shenannigans this week the SP would have dominated them all from the moon.  I believe that we are seeing the emergence of the Tesla Hedge. Canoo is, in my opinion, strategically grabbing market share while staying out of the way of direct competition with luxury EV models. Its doing its own thing.\n\n# Hypermasculine BubbleTruk drop dominates automotive world.\n\n[BubbleTruk](https://u.teknik.io/ikfDb.jpg) was so fucking weird.  People had a strong feeling about it, hating or loving it... No one ignored it. Media has shifted significantly into covering Canoo's Electric Truck Release (Did fisker even do anything at MPG ?)  [Google news overflowing](https://u.teknik.io/44XGk.jpg) with articles in the past 3 days. Probably some pay to play, but whatever.  Check the plenty of articles with titles calling the Bangbus as a TSLA competitor.  That belief will be self fulfilling.  We are currently standing at the base of a significant change in perception [a trend reversal](https://u.teknik.io/4Zo6x.PNG) that will have long lasting positive consequences to valuation.  But competing with Tesla is not the only thing on Canoo's mind, Canoo seeks to corner the entire fucking truck market.  Lets compare.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|u/basketfragrant brought this to my attention|Canoo ChadTruk|^(ford F-150)|Cyber.. truck?|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**Payload**|1800 - What engine?

In fact, If I was long in GOEV and that video dropped, I would have by now.  Its clear that the CannooBro's fanbase has only survived because of California's strict gun legislation.\n\nI am highly encouraged by Electric ChadTruk video because everything about it was better. The presentation, the lighting the guest, the reality of its presence.  There was something just so dominant about it where Canoo just showed versus explained to me why I should think its cool. Tony talked about taking his significant other out and his Guys on the jobsite.  This offends the westcoast hipster elite.  Listen, the fact that he didn't say \"My arm candy sextoy never drives\" means he's paying attention to the Mandatory Training PowerPoint slides. The MPDV felt like a joke you have to explain... like your portfolio's performance before last Monday.   This level of difference is indicative of serious corporate flexibility and an ability to create meaningful change when you miss your target.  Its not all wins but its how you roll with the punches that matters. \n\n**Let me put it to you like this, you didn't know you wanted that truck until you saw the video.** \n\n# That stinks like Steve Jobs. \n\n**Trend Reversal.**\n\n# No Real  ETF Yet, straight unconcerned.\n\n|/u/bagtf3 reported this.|GOEV|WKHS|FSR|NIO|RIDE|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|\\# ETFs|3|38|13|75|14|\n|\\#ETF Held shares|114K|13m|7.1m|49.7m|5.6m|\n\nAfter being involved in stocks with ETF exposure (read: **Every single other stock out there**)  I can appreciate that we will only be going up versus blaming all of our losses on \"ETF shorting\".  Depending on the catalyst that brings that exposure we could see millions of shares being scooped up. Note the comparable amount of the rest of comparable stocks. Somewhere between Nio and Fisk is 10 percent of our FF.  Just saying.\n\nIn other news, Cathie Wood is excited about the Canoo truck because she will finally be able to fit all of Ark's Short Interest in the back without having to fold the seat down.  The only problem is that the 200 mile range might not be enough to find the share price at the bottom of the chart.  She's just a attention grabbing vaporware empty bag holdin... Wait what? What? **Breaking news!** Ark picked us up..\n\nShe's a **genius**. Truly visionary with her approach.\n\n( Just to be clear Ark didn't pick us up)... ^(yet)\n\n**Imminent Trend Reversal**\n\n# Monday is Roth , Partner Announcement would be cool.\n\nThey could announce something and really just fucking make everyone who boarded this party train in the last 4 days so fucking rich its disgusting or longs break even.  I'm just kidding, they're going to be rich too. Especially people with warrants.  They are going to get the nursing home bed next to the window.\n\nBut lets be real and get to know the **bear perspective.**\n\n/u/Dramatic-Trainer-268\n\n\"Roth could end up being fruitful, but it'd be the first time they released material info at a conference/round table like this since I started following them And since they revealed the MPDV in Dec they've been stone fucking silent So I worry they're going to drag their feet on providing any new info before 4/16And the only reason I think they'd hold those numbers for an extended period of time is if they weren't as good as they wanted them to be prior to announcing them Few weeks after revealing MPDV and opening up US pre-orders, they opened it up to Canada and Mexico too. Out of the blue. Felt like they wanted to juice the numbers.$100 deposit, fully refundable, so people will hate on them being true pre-orders\"\n\nHe's actually super bullish and literally knows everything about Canoo Inc.  he just wants you to know that its not all shits and giggles.  I'm wondering about earnings too... Its like were at the action sequence of the movie and we just got done killing the monster, but there's still 30 minutes left in the film.  Nevertheless I'm feeling good.\n\nI want to end with some wild speculation from the man that leaked the ChadTruk in the first place.\n\n/u/PlaneReflection\n\n\"I\u2019m speculating that Walmart will purchase a fleet of MPDVs for Walmart+ deliveries.\n\n* \\-Paul B mentioned \u201cretailers like Walmart\u201d several times.\n* \\-MPDV is the cheapest cargo van, electric or gas, on the market.\n* \\-MPDV has the greatest cargo volume for its footprint, meaning more deliveries in less trips.\n* \\-Canoo\u2019s phone-as-a-key and fleet management software provides much better integration, than any other vehicle.\n* \\-EVs make sense from a fleet perspective as minimal maintenance, no dealing with gas cards, can charge at Walmart sites and etc.\n* \\-Canoo Lifestyle vehicle was coincidentally spotted charging at a Walmart in Arizona on [Twitter](https://u.teknik.io/4ImZF.PNG):\"\n\n**I'll drop a post Monday morning with Ortex Data, Strats and hype maps.**\n\nEdit 1 - Canoo Roth [Participation](https://roth.meetmax.com/sched/event_70981/__co-list_cp.html?event_id=70981&no_save_search=&_filter_name=&filter_name=&_tab=&investor_id=&cmd=search&search_fld=company&search_op=like&search_for=canoo&search_fld=&search_op=like&search_for=) shows 1-1 meetings no presentation unlikely to drop news. thanks /u/Dramatic-Trainer-268", "id": "m4rhbl", "created_utc": 1615711231.0, "score": 214, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "Fuck me dead, you need a TLDR for your fucking title mate.", "score": 62, "replies": [{"body": "AKA summary", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "aka TLDR", "score": 18, "replies": [{"body": "AKA recap", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "AKA aka.", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "winner", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24977093935012817}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.47152388095855713}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4382730722427368}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.35934922099113464}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16956943273544312}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18075011670589447}, {"body": "This man has 66 3/19 17.5  expiring this Friday.

Interestingly, if you're a vehicle manufacturer (and they appear to be), you can even put your own prototype plates on damn near anything.  But, as soon as you try to title one and sell it, you have a problem.  They haven't gotten to this stage yet.  Now, they would be absolute fucking retards if they didn't have a plan in the works.  So I assume they do, even if they haven't talked about it.  However, it is worth noting that drive-by-wire has been possible since the early 90's or so.  Hell, we've had aircraft that were entirely fly-by-wire since the 80's.  GM, Ford, Honda, and Toyota have all built drive-by-wire prototypes.  But NONE of them have ever even tried to build a production drive-by-wire car despite the obvious advantages of doing so.\n\nIt is possible that they are such large companies that they just don't NEED to push boundaries like that.  I can accept that.  However, as I said, all have produced drive-by-wire prototypes which have received excellent reviews on the show circuit.  When your audience likes a feature that you can build, why would you not?  And yet here we are.  Hell, GM built a prototype that was essentially this in the late 90's or early 2000's.  And their marketing around that prototype was that you could switch bodies in a couple of hours.  The powertrain was entirely in the frame (sounding familiar?) and so any major mechanical issues could be sorted out in a couple of hours by swapping the body onto a good chassis (and powertrain) and off you go.

They even built a few of them for demo purposes and were generally well received with the exception of complaints about range.\n\nI'm still bullish on $GOEV.
