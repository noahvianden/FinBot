MX is a semiconductor company that makes **Display Driver Integrated Circuits** (DDIC). \"DDIC chips are a core device for switching and displaying control functions needed by displays\".\n2. Magnachip is the #1 independent global DDIC manufacturer in the world and provides solutions for phones, TV's, automobile screens (regular + EV), VR, and more. They supply to companies like Samsung or LG who controls 95% of the OLED display market. - [source](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/MAGNACHIP-SEMICONDUCTOR-C-6361073/news/MagnaChip-Semiconductor-Ranked-No-1-in-the-Global-OLED-Smartphone-DDIC-Non-Captive-Market-30995864/)\n\nIf I use my body as an example, my brain tells my body what to do, but without my spinal cord, I'm useless.\n\n* Brain = Processor\n* Body = Display\n* DDIC = Spinal Cord\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/75akoidtqso61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=47aaf7578df9e63380e69dfa7040d1ce0446eede\n\n# History\n\n1. **MX is a 20+ year company that was the first in the market to start developing OLED DDIC (2003). Due to being the first in the market, they have had a lot of time to develop and have accumulated quality IP/Patents and processes for OLED DDIC. -** [source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnachip-surpasses-the-500-million-milestone-in-cumulative-shipments-of-display-driver-ics-for-oled-screens-300891577.html)\n\nWhat is OLED? OLED is the next generation of screens.\n\n* TV went from Tube - LCD - LED\n* Phones are going from LCD - OLED\n\n1. **The issue was, MX was so early to the game (in 2003) that no one was ready for OLED. Smartphones didn't even exist yet. So while MX kept producing other products such as DDIC for LCD, MX kept preparing and developing their baby, knowing that the secret sauce was in the OLED.**\n\n# So what has changed? 5G AND OLED!\n\n1. **As you all know, 5G is going to become the norm within the next 2-3 years.**\n\nIf you have been living under a rock, 5G is the next generation in cellular connectivity, 100x faster which is going to open all sorts of opportunities for the world.\n\nWhen phone manufacturers introduce the new \"latest and greatest\", you can't give a phone with 5G lightning speeds but not upgrade everything else! So manufacturers upgrade other parts of the phone to continuously justify the price point.\n\n2. **Manufacturers need to add things like:**\n\n* Better/slimmer designs\n* Faster processors\n* New Colors\n* But most obviously, better quality screens.\n\nScreens have become more important especially with the rise of the mobile gaming industry. Reports estimate that by the end of 2020, mobile game revenue will hit $76.7 billion, more than the film and music industry combined. - [source](https://www.ironsrc.com/blog/top-51-mobile-app-and-gaming-statistics/). We all know you can't be playing Fortnite or watch Youtube while looking at a potato screen.\n\n# Connecting MX and the rise of 5G\n\nMX has been waiting 18 years for this day to come.\n\n* **MX has recently launched their new DDIC product lines which feature** **a 28nm OLED DDIC (down from 40nm) = smaller thinner phone. The DDIC's also feature -** [source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/magnachip-launches-28-nanometer-oled-ddic-for-smartphone-displays-300831906.html)\n* 120hz High Frame Rate (HFR) = smoother picture, especially for gaming.\n* compatibility with various display types = rigid, flexible, foldable, VR/AR\n* reduction in power voltage from 1.1v to 1.0 = reducing power consumption by more than 20% and extending battery life\n* reduction in Electromagnetic Interference by 20% = clearer phone calls\n* support for Low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) displays = more power efficient backplane = extending battery life\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sdbr7vzuqso61.png?width=316&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ab9c244e170feb1f49ac66a3506693470c7d93b\n\n**In addition, the 28nm OLED DDIC are going to be made in 300mm fabs (factories) = greater profit margin**\n\n* Chips are made in fabs, usually on 200 or 300mm wafers. - [source](http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/ice/cd/CEICM/SECTION7.pdf)\n* 200mm wafers was technology introduced in 1992,\n* This is similar to trying to boil 1 million eggs in a medium sized saucepan.\n* In addition, the saucepan is old and it's possible that the eggs might get cracked = lower yield/lower margins.\n* 300mm wafers are the new standard in making chip making 1 million eggs in a shiny large pot (which has a lower chance of eggs getting cracked) = higher yield/ higher margin\n\n# OLEDs are booming:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ga8351tvqso61.png?width=372&format=png&auto=webp&s=522d1d40be7e52d5b2e4497fecd471292e708f7e\n\n# A few last things... (if you get this innuendo, good job):\n\n1. A Korean tech blog reported that the new iPhone 13 displays will be supplied exclusively by Samsung. It is said that they want\n\n* OLED Screen\n* 120hz HFR\n* LPTO Displays\n\n1. Hmm.. I wonder if Samsung has a relationship with a DDIC company that has the chips that provides/support all that? - [source](http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2128)\n2. OLED is here, gaming console usage could become a very large upside opportunity. The Nintendo Switch (upcoming) will have a OLED display (albeit a lower end one, called rigid OLED compared to ones in iPhones)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f7s8adazqso61.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa3b33956770f31b44024ba6c62ee4dbfeea917d\n\nSource: [https://www.tomsguide.com/amp/news/nintendo-switch-pro-oled-analyst-tips-september-release-date-up-to-20-better-battery-life?\\_\\_twitter\\_impression=true](https://www.tomsguide.com/amp/news/nintendo-switch-pro-oled-analyst-tips-september-release-date-up-to-20-better-battery-life?__twitter_impression=true)\n\n4. **MX is also rumored to be for sale as mentioned earlier** [**https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&no=205435**](https://pulsenews.co.kr/view.php?year=2021&no=205435)\n\n5. AND some frigid weather knocked out Samsung's Austin plant that makes OLED DDICs for Apple  (still shut down as of two weeks ago [source](https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2021/03/10/samsungs-austin-fab-still-shut-down-weeks-after-texas-freeze/6924766002/)). Do you think Apple wants to have all its eggs in one basket going forward?\n\n# Valuation\n\n**Despite a nice run in YTD 2021, MX is still dirt cheap, trading at 8-9x Adj. 2021 EBITDA, which is dirt cheap for a high growth technology stonk.**\n\n**Competitor in the space and recent acquisitions have been at much higher multiples.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ijqc7681rso61.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=997b93bff21a09fc00876b3af44462640137a145\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aqt9abz1rso61.png?width=423&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b5ba3f92b8d03401b10529baf1a57b02e1cb3e2\n\n# What does the current returns projections look like?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1tbnj8v2rso61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=574252d80a8f08002e5936f3d15cc14a081d164b\n\n**I think the company will easily hit $65-70mm EBITDA in 2021 and rerate to a higher EV multiple, in line with competitors who are valued at a 25x-35x EV/EBITDA multiple: 100% upside. Longer term, as OLEd gains further traction and takes share from LCD and penetrates into TV, automotive, and gaming smartphones, 2023 EBITDA could grow to well north of $150mm with MX worth potentially 10x its current market cap.**\n\nShout out to [u/Craziedog](https://www.reddit.com/u/Craziedog/) for special insights\n\n**Tl;dr $MX 100% gains today, (potential) 1000% gains by 2023.** **BUY SHARES** \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "mbhb2a", "created_utc": 1616513515.0, "score": 142, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "100% gains today you say?", "score": 33, "replies": [{"body": "oh wow -10% so close", "score": 23, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0702303946018219}, {"body": "Basically any bullish DD on this sub means puts.", "score": 12, "replies": [{"body": "To do that on this company would make you a true smooth brain \ud83d\ude05 this shyt more needed than Apple", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "mvis doing aight", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Lol the +/- 10% days back and forth are killing me though, I bought in just a little too high :/", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15959972143173218}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11534930765628815}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3550158143043518}, {"body": "RemindMe! 4 hours", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "I will be messaging you in 4 hours on [**2021-03-23 20:24:03 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-03-23%2020:24:03%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mbhb2a/best_oled5g_value_play_mx_magnachip_makes_oled/gry081n/?context=3)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fwallstreetbets%2Fcomments%2Fmbhb2a%2Fbest_oled5g_value_play_mx_magnachip_makes_oled%2Fgry081n%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202021-03-23%2020%3A24%3A03%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20mbhb2a)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["pm"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21451319754123688}, {"body": "Maybe if you had a put", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.19161629676818848}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22099123895168304}, {"body": "Was there compensation for the current chip shortage.
