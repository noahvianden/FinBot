Maybe I have no clue, all I am saying is that there is no certainty in the current $600B it's all based on future prospects\n\nFirst, have a clue if you're going to provide what appears to be due diligence, ie providing a quote.\n\nHere's what I've been able to find.  There are roughly a billion shares, which makes the math easy.  Multiply the share price by a billion, and you're in the ballpark.  TSLA's market cap at close today was 593B.  Let's call it 600B.\n\nYou can't measure all companies the same.  Older \"value\" companies are often compared by their P/E ratio, but there are a few different statistics that are used.  But for companies growing exponentially, you measure them by taking their last year's revenue and multiplying it by some factor.  Ideally, that multiple is enough to equal what the company's revenue would be in 5 - 8 years.\n\nIf you're growing by 50% a year, then a 15 - 20x is probably appropriate for last year's earnings.  Perhaps even a 25x in some cases.  That's it.  That's how value it.  And it doesn't matter what happens on the daily or even quarterly basis.  The end result after years is undeniable, an irresistible force.\n\n31B x 20 = 600B.  So, we're pretty much spot on.  We could go drop down to 450B at a 15x rating.  At this very instant.  And this is what we had before the induction to the S&P.  But for two years or even just a year in the future?  \n\nNo.\n\nWhy?  What drives the stock price anyways?  We're not getting money from it.  There's no dividends.  There's nothing but a popularity contest, really?\n\nWell, first, big money always wins out.  And they're valuing TSLA by some multiple of revenue, guaranteed.  They'll be buying when it drops below their number, and selling when it gets above, in the billions if it comes to it. And big money understand that value is perceived.  And they're going by not only what they consider fair market value, but also what retail will think.\n\nAnd what makes the difference for retail is the excitement that an exponentially growing company generates.  Every week, every month, every quarter there is something new and amazing.  For years on end. And it attracts buyers to the stock like moths to flame.  It is the solid, earth-shattering and unending drumbeat of success.\n\nAnd it takes a personality like Elon's to mark that cadence.\n\nTesla is going to absolutely change the world in ways that we have yet to imagine.  No doubt about it.  They've already done so by just proving that an EV can not only be viable, but far superior to ICE driven auto.  But all this has just been the warm up.\n\nJust a final thought: the reason that Elon left Paypal?  The other founders weren't on board with his vision.  He wanted to drive Paypal to be the banking system of the world, and use it to push out local and international banks.  And it's likely that he saw a clear path to doing this.  But that was too much to chew on for people like Peter Thiel, who balked and helped set up the effort to oust Musk.\n\nThey're either going big, or to zero.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "That's a lot of words for naught where all you needed is the last sentence where you agree with me, although not even I think we're well past the point where Tesla could go to zero.

What I'll say is that it's a fantastic company with a bright future and access to literally the top engineering talent after SpaceX meanwhile their competition is sucking their thumbs for the most part. However, I'm just not comfortable having a significant stake at this price where I can lose 2/3's of my money (3/4 if we were a month ago) and still be in an arguably fairly priced position, so I have no interest in re-opening one quite yet.
