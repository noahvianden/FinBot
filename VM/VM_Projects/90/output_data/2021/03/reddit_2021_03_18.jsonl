My understanding is that banks needed to hold treasuries as collateral against lending. Banks had been buying up bonds to increase their collateral so that another financial crisis didnt occur and they could bail themselves out with the collateral instead of taxpayers. Lending was tight, so When covid hit, the fed wanted banks to increase lending to businesses and households to survive, but banks didnt want to because it was risky. The fed suspended the SLR (well, they excluded treasuries from the SLR) so that banks would lend more easily and people and businesses could extend credit lines. \n\nBanks started selling the treasuries TO THE FED, via QE, and used the capital to lend.\n\nSO, when the SLR suspension expires, and SLR is in effect, banks need to start holding more capital and do less lending. They will need to hold more collateral aka bonds. Banks will be buying bonds up like no tomorrow to get back to the regulations of the SLR.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThats how I understand it, chime in if you have anything to add", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.06882988661527634}, {"body": "Thanks for this!
