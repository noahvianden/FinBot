{"title": "Risk Management, or How to Not Lose Your House", "selftext": "***TLDR; make smaller trades, trade different stocks for diversification, and make sure your portfolio isn\u2019t 100% dependent on either the market or volatility going in a particular direction.***\n\n# Introduction\n\nI've been seeing a lot of posts lately from people blowing up their accounts in one way or another, and I would say most if not all of these happened because of a lack of risk management. When you're trying to build an options portfolio, there are strategies and rules you can implement to minimize the chances of half your portfolio evaporating.\n\n# Money Management and Position Sizing\n\nThere was a study in 2016 where participants were given $25 and were asked to bet on coin clips for 30 minutes. The coin was weighed so it would land on heads 60% of the time, but the payout was 1:1. Despite the obvious mathematical advantage, 28% of the participants wiped out. out of 61 participants, 18 bet their entire bankroll in one go.\n\nPosition sizing is especially important when options trading. Yes, you might have an edge, but variance is always worse than you expect. If you wouldn't bet your net worth on a coin toss, why would you bet more than you can afford to lose on weeklies that expire worthless 70% of the time? By keeping your individual position sizes small, you reduce the risk of any single trade wiping you out. Check out the Kelly criterion if you want to learn more about \"optimal\" betting sizes.\n\nPersonally, I try to keep the risk of each position under 5% of my portfolio. That doesn't necessarily mean that I can only spend 5% of my portfolio buying power on one trade, but I might have a stop loss equal to a 5% loss of my overall portfolio.\n\nFor example, if you have a $1,000 account, you can spend $200 on RKT weeklies if you want, but if you follow the 5% rule, you should have a stop loss and close the trade when your calls lose $50.\n\nOn top of that, I wouldn\u2019t have more than 50% of my account at risk at any given time. This way, I can buy the dip when it happens, or give my (short) positions a bit of extra margin if things go wrong. Options utilize leverage, so you don't need to use every dollar of buying power available to you.\n\n# Asset Diversification\n\nAside from keeping your account in multiple smaller positions, you want to keep your holdings in different assets. If you have a bunch of small positions but they're all in meme/tech stocks, you're probably not having a good month right about now. Spread out your trades across different sectors of stocks. A portfolio with PLTR, RKT, BLNK, NIO, and TSLA is going to be a lot risker than a portfolio with PLTR, GLD, SPY, BA, and TLT. I'm not saying don't trade the meme stocks, but they shouldn't be 80% of your portfolio.\n\nGood tickers to trade are liquid, well known, and generally not too correlated with each other. An example watchlist could be AAPL, BA, CRSR, SPY, IWM, QQQ, PLTR, GLD, WMT, and MS. The broad market indexes SPY, IWM, and QQQ are more correlated than most, but you can use them to adjust your portfolio - IWM is more small caps, and QQQ is good for tech exposure.\n\n# Directional Diversification\n\nIn addition to trading different stocks, you might also want to trade in different directions. Stocks in different sectors might be less correlated, but a broader market downturn could still hurt your portfolio. You might want to have long deltas for some of your positions and short deltas on other stocks.\n\nMaybe you think that the financial sector is going to outperform and tech is on a bit of a downwards trend, maybe you want to be short tech for a while instead of just waiting to buy the dip. I'm personally a net seller of options, so I might sell put spread on MS and call spreads on AAPL. This way, even when the broader market dips I'm okay since at least one of my trades will do really well.\n\nIt's good practice to look at the beta of your portfolio, and see what your PnL looks like compared to moves in a benchmark of your choice. Your broker should be able to calculate how correlated individual stocks are to your benchmark and determine how your portfolio is affected by market conditions. If your broker doesn't do that, please get a better broker. If you're playing on Robinhood with a few hundred bucks, fine. But if you're trading seriously and have a profit goal instead of an entertainment budget, please switch to something like TOS or IBKR.\n\nFor me, IBKR's risk navigator lets me know that by next month, I'll make $500 on my overall (theta gang) portfolio as long as SPY stays within +/- 5% of where it is today. Of course, I can boost my returns even more through managing my trades; squeezing some more gains out of my winners, and losing the minimum on trades that go wrong.\n\n# Volatility Diversification\n\nEver hear of IV crush? When you buy calls right before earnings, your stock pops up 10% the next day, and you still lose all your money? That's implied volatility working against you. Similarly, if you're only long vega and the market + the VIX calms down, it's suddenly a lot harder for you to make money. Even directionally uncorrelated assets like SPY and TLT have correlated volatility; when the market tanks, everybody rushes into bonds for safety. While SPY falls and TLT increases, both have become more volatile for different reasons. If you've only got Iron Condors on these two tickers, you might be in trouble.\n\nHave some positions that benefit from increased volatility and some that are the other way around. If you only have short strangles and credit spreads, maybe try some calendar spreads on stocks with lower volatility. If you only have debit spreads, maybe you might want to sell some Iron Condors on med-high IV rank stocks.", "id": "lyp1uc", "created_utc": 1614987922.0, "score": 211, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "There are also resources, links, frequent answers on risk reduction, trade size, and more at the   \n[Options Questions Safe Haven weekly thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/subreddit_resources)\n\nExample links found there:  \n\n---\n\n*Trade planning, risk reduction and trade size*  \n\u2022&nbsp;[Exit-first trade planning, and a risk-reduction checklist (Redtexture)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/9at2fu/noob_thread_aug_26_sept_1/e4ywq0u/)  \n\u2022&nbsp;[Risk Management, or How to Not Lose Your House (boii0708) ( March 6 2021)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/lyp1uc/risk_management_or_how_to_not_lose_your_house/)  \n\u2022&nbsp;[Trade Checklists and Guides (Option Alpha)](https://optionalpha.com/members/guides-checklists)  \n\u2022&nbsp;[Planning for trades to fail.

The way you protect yourself could be buying a $150 call and $90 put for a total of $1. \n\nSo what does your PnL look like? Ideally, AAPL stays flat and all your options expire worthless; you get to keep the $4 you received for selling the Iron Condor. \n\nYour worst-case scenario would be the stock straying past your long option strikes; if AAPL closed at $200 at expiration your short call would get assigned, and you would be forced to sell APPL shares at $140.

I believe they are working together on Amazon's long overdue Prime Air fleet which will give BB access to autonomous flight data from hundreds of thousands of drones. This will put them years ahead of any evtol manufacturer or rtos developer and secure a monopoly in endpoint management for virtually anything on the IOT and is capable of moving vertically.\n\nToday, BlackBerry was featured at Morgan Stanley Technology's media conference. Charles Eagan (BB's Chief Tech Officer) answered a bunch of questions about security, IVY, QNX, end-point management etc. [Link to Webcast](https://morganstanley.webcasts.com/starthere.jsp?ei=1430549&tp_key=381e2505f3). (Drones mentioned at 18 minutes)\n\nWhen asked about drones, Charles said: \"we are not allowed to talk about which vendors are using which tech,\" and \"there is a number of active drone engagement that are happening\"\n\nThis practically confirms my theory that 1) IVY is being developed for not just ground based vehicles but flying ones as well and 2) they are working on it with some degree of secrecy.\n\nAmazon's drone fleet running on IVY will a great catalyst for BB share price... and that announcement can come at anytime. There is also some speculation going on about potential acquisition of BB, which isn't that far-fetched considering how John Chen joined Sybase in 1998, reinvented the company, and sold it to SAP a decade later.\n\nPositions: April $12.5C, June $13C, June $15C, and a boatload of shares", "id": "ly37pq", "created_utc": 1614915891.0, "score": 456, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "Good news and DD for BB? 5$ at open it is!", "score": 258, "replies": [{"body": "Spit on me", "score": 65, "replies": [{"body": "Yup, this is what I needed.

Roblox offers a monthly subscription service called \u201cRoblox Premium\u201d where users can obtain exclusive items and a monthly supply of Robux.\n\n*In 2020, Roblox was the 2nd most watched game on YouTube with 75 Billion views*\n\n# Market Data\n\n**IPO** [^(source)](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/rblx/ipo)\n\n* **SEC Filing:** Feb 11th, 2021\n   * [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312521038726/d87104ds1a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312521038726/d87104ds1a.htm)\n* **Exchange:** NYSE\n* **Ticker:** RBLX\n* **IPO Date:** March 10th\n* **Est.

Players purchase Robux directly for prices ranging from $4.99 to $99.99. Players can spend Robux on game-specific purchases that goes to the Creators with a 30% fee taken out.\n\nCreators can exchange Robux for USD at a current rate $350 per 100,000 Robux as of March 4, 2020. To purchase 100,000 Robux would require 10 purchases of the $99.99 package (10k Robux each) for a total of $999.90.\n\nRoblox also offers three subscription tiers ranging from $4.99 to $19.99 a month, which earns a player Robux and Exclusive store items.\n\nMerchandise plays a role in revenue generation as well. Roblox offers clothing, figurines and gift cards which can be purchased online and in person from places like Amazon, Walmart, GameStop, and Target.\n\n# Growth Potential and Catalyst\n\nThe current outlook for Roblox to grow is promising. There are active investments being made in expanding the age range, international reach, monetization, and technical capabilities of the platform. By continuing to employ modern technology to improve the platform, higher quality experiences and content that appeals to older age demographics can be created.\n\nCurrent international markets for Roblox include US, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Roblox is actively investing in technology that they hope will enhance their growth around the world. For example, they hope to use automated translation and built-in regional compliance tools to help scale into other global markets.\n\nMonetization is another key component to Roblox growing. Recently Roblox Premium which offers a monthly subscription service to its users was added. Roblox actively works with its creator and developer community to help bring them improve their monetization, which in turn increases Roblox\u2019s monetization. Roblox expects to work with leading brands to build unique marketing opportunities to the platform.\n\n# Competitors and Differences\n\nOne of the things to keep in mind about Roblox itself is not a game, but a gaming platform and ecosystem of multiple gaming experiences. Over 18 million games can be launched from their website and played through a downloaded app on the user\u2019s computer. Each game can be completely unique from every other game.\n\nRoblox as a platform would more closely related to that of Steam (by Valve) or Epic Games Launcher (by Epic) or Origin (by EA). However, instead of purchasing games through this, a user simply launches whichever one of these free experiences they want at any time. There is no purchasing of the game like there is on the other mentioned platforms.\n\nRoblox\u2019s main difference is they use the underlying tools to create Roblox specific games utilizing their Software Development Kit (SDK). Other games launched on Steam or Epic are much more loosely connected to the platforms distributing it, whereas Roblox games are highly connected to the Roblox platform in general. The barrier of entry to create a Roblox gaming experience is much less difficult than to create a game to release on other distribution platforms, however the games themselves are \u201cRoblox-centric\u201d and have common styling, controls, and gaming mechanisms.\n\nRoblox does not charge for the games themselves, but a user buys virtual items and enhancements through their virtual currency called Robux (See \u201cRevenue Generation\u201d). A user can also be a Roblox Creator who can create virtual items that will appear on their character in all games. They can also create their own Roblox experiences and sell items unique to that game on their own store for Robux. Robux can then be turned into real money (100k Robux -> $350 USD) if the creator wishes to cash out, or they can spend it for themselves within Roblox.\n\n# The User Experience and YouTube Scene\n\nWhen a Roblox player wants to play a game, they navigate to the Roblox website and login. This allows them to browse a list of games and launch the experience within a downloaded application on their computer called the Roblox Player.\n\nUsers on the website can change their avatar and browse the shop for various items such as gear, emotes, characters, and other customizations. Players can connect with their friends or join 1 or more groups of other players to form smaller communities to play together.\n\nRoblox is massive in the YouTube scene. The official Roblox channel has \\~2.9 Million Subscribers. Some YouTube creators attempt to create their own content and promote it on their channel to earn Robux, which they can then exchange for real-life cash.\n\nRoblox can appeal to different age groups for different reasons. While younger age-groups are the ones playing the game, older age-groups are finding ways to make tons of money as developers and creators.\n\n*In 2020, Roblox was the second most watched game on YouTube (second only to Minecraft)*\n\n# Conclusion\n\nBeing relatively new to trading and this being my first due-diligence for a company, I hesitate to make any sort of predictions personally on where this price will go up or down. My gut tells me the $45 price doesn't feel over or under valued, but I think Roblox has a lot of growth potential over the next year.\n\n**Again, you should NOT take any of this as sound financial advice. I am very new to this.**\n\nI do welcome all criticisms and feedback you have to offer. Tell me what's good, bad and missing from this DD!\n\n**EDITS**\n\n* **March 5, 2021 @ 6:40pm CT**\n   * Fixed Typos\n   * Added \"Competitors and Differences\" section", "id": "lym9kc", "created_utc": 1614979431.0, "score": 161, "upvote_ratio": 0.86, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "Just to add/clarify it is going public via DPO and not the IPO route.\n\nhttps://capital.com/roblox-ipo-is-this-gaming-platform-a-good-fit-for-your-portfolio", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for this!
