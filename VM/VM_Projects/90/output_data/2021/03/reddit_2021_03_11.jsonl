{"title": "AMC , COMMON SENSE 3. A few reasons AMC may increase in stock value. As in will fo to the moon. Not financial advice just discussion and common sense. Yes I did analyze the heck out of DTCC.", "selftext": "COMMON SENSE 3 ( long read for those that care, or the ones on the fence about pushing the sell and lose button)\n\nDTCC, stimulus, loyal base, summer movie hits, the entire country opening, immunizations... We all know 4th qtr earnings are going to suck because of Coivd. So what.. it\u2019s over. And that is past news. Let me remind you all. AMC is up about 30 percent this week. Why ? We all freaking know the Ape army and the general public is going to pour into amc and our rival/Gme. DTC is coming 8-60 days all depends if the sec submits a rebuttal. That is a GAME CHANGER FOR AMC. The hedge fund golden spoon boys who sucked daddy\u2019s credit card and went to Harvard and MIT are fukeddd. Bank ain\u2019t gonna lend you that much and they are gonna have the ability to call for Funds at anytime. This will change the game and at a minimum push up the stock. We also have the usuals. America opening, Coivd vaccinations, movie lovers wanting to go back with their families. AMC has a better foundation then gme. \n\nImportant!!! Hey guys and gals think about it.. AMC is a 110 year old company. Survived world war 1 and 2 and Spanish flu. It\u2019s a solid company about to pop during the summer (we all know this) \n\nIf some people think amc is a crazy meme stock ... well .. b I t c o I n is an imaginary digital currency. If you think about it to much you\u2019ll get a headache and it actually doesn\u2019t even exist in the real world: yet how much is it worth ?? Exactly..,, for all the AMC bitch haters. AMC was not worth more then 20 dollars in 2019 because it wasn\u2019t a hot stock, it wasn\u2019t tech, it wasn\u2019t Amazon , it wasn\u2019t trending. Guess the fuck what ? It\u2019s hot now amd will sizzle Into the fall. Entertainment is the tech of 2021. AMC profits in the upcoming qtrs will crush expectations. \n\nGo ... go to the movies . Nothing good playing ? Our money is playing. Watch a cartoon dragon, watch a silly love story, watch a car get blown up. Get out to the AMC movies!!! Common sense. AMC army strong. Patience and holding and micro purchasing will get us anything we want.

DFV was 100% right on that. They also have suffered with restricted retail access but not to the extent that AMC has. They're more fighting the online market, which they've now lined themselves up to combat... so they COULD become a real big player, but that's a bit more of a long shot, and a very long game, and the end value is extremely hard to gauge, but betting against value in 5 years at 3x+ current real mkt value is a pretty big bet. The real bet on gamestop at this point is on the squeeze, which can only happen if diamond fucking hands hold diamond strong.... AND that the game is actually playing out as people are hoping TBQH.... because we can't see anyone elses hands, and there's millions of players with a number of huge players that have better information access than we do (but they also grossly underestimate retard stronk)\n\nEDIT: THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.
