{"title": "$SKT DD done Quickly and Deeply", "selftext": "\ud83d\ude80\n\n$SKT, or Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. is a real estate investment trust (REIT) and one \nof the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada. It is the only publicly \ntraded \"pure-play\" for outlet centers. The founder, Stanley K. Tanger, entered the outlet business in 1981 \nand the company was taken public in June 1993.\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 \n\nSKT owns or has ownership interest in a portfolio of 40 upscale outlet shopping \ncenters totaling 14.4 million square feet, located in 21 states and in Canada. Its properties are leased to \nover 3,100 stores and 510 different brand name companies. Its outlet centers range in size from 82,000 to \nnearly 750,000 square feet.\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n \nOutlet centers are generally operated by manufacturers and brand name retailers that sell \nbranded products, but specifically made for the outlet distribution channel. This allows them to sell to \nconsumers at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department and specialty stores. \nEach of SKT's outlet centers, except for one, carries the Tanger brand name. SKT's outlets are typically \nlocated at least 10 miles from major department stores and full-price retail stores. Many are also located \nnear tourist destinations or close proximity to interstate highways to provide visibility.\nAs the only publicly traded outlet mall REIT, Tanger enjoys a unique franchise within the retail REIT space. Its \nclosest peers are likely regional malls, although some of the general mall REITs also have a presence in the \noutlet mall space. However, many of the general mall REITs are experiencing pressures from the challenges \nmany department stores are facing, and SKT as vulnerable as well.\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nFaced with struggling retail tenants in 2018, SKT has chosen to offer short-term (1 \nyear) leases to tenants at drastically lower rates (approximately 20%-25% according to calculations from \nadditional disclosures). SKT is attempting to avoid the blight of vacant stores at its centers and keep \noccupancy above 95%, with the goal of turning these short-term leases back to long-term leases once the \nretailer turmoil is over. The strategy may be the best option among a number of poor ones, \nbut are concerned that the lower rent deals will spread to other tenants. The \ncurrent environment can be viewed as typical of a \"normal\" retail downturn which usually coincides with a recession. \nInstead, consumer spending and confidence is high, leading to a dramatic secular shift among \nretailers, especially apparel, as consumers spending habits and tastes change. SKT's entire \nexposure to apparel tenants is therefore concerning.\n\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nAnnual tenant sales per square foot (a measure of portfolio productivity) peaked at \nnearly $400 in 2015, declined to $383 in Q2 2018 due to the ongoing retail turmoil, and has since recovered \nmodestly to $391 as of Q1 2019. As detailed above, SKT has committed to keeping occupancy above 95%, \nwhich it continues to do and has done since 1993. However, the occupancy could dip below 95% for \n2019 as the retail environment continues to degrade. This has come at the expense of lower rents and same \ncenter net operating income that is now contracting at -0.5% as of Q1 2019. Overall cash blended rental \nrates also turned negative to -0.8% as of Q2 2018, down from mid-teen levels in 2011-2015, but has \nimproved slightly to 0.6% growth as of Q1 2019. SKT's balance sheet becoming stressed as cash flow and EBITDA declines. Debt-to-EBITD has crept \nup slightly to 6.1x, near shopping center peer averages and lower than shopping mall peers. However, this ratio could rise as vacancies rise and/or short-term leases with lower rents are increasingly used. \nSKT currently carries a BBB and Baa1 rating from S&P and Moody's, respectively. While S&P gives SKT a \nstable outlook Moody's revised its outlook to \"Negative\" as of March 12, 2019.\n\n\n\n\nI have no positions in $SKT, just sharing some research.

{"title": "DD: Tech Bubble could be starting to Deflate", "selftext": "I\u2019m a huge bull. I\u2019ve been optimistic about the market since the crash. I bought the dip faithfully every single crash from March through the horrors of June, through the shit month that Sep was, until today.    \n\n\n***\nMy entire perspective shifted today.    \n\n***\n\n# Why you might ask?\n\n***\n\nThe whole bullish philosophy was built on the fact that the Fed printed and was willing to print indefinitely. \n\n\nThis works, until they reduce their printing capabilities. \n\n\n***\n\nIn the past week or so, we\u2019ve seen bond yields spike. Bond yields move inversely to bond prices, so this is equivalent to saying bond prices tanked. \n\n\nThey tanked because investors have begun to worry about inflation and the tightened monetary policy that could come with that. Why the hell would you hold bonds if inflation basically saps away any profit you might make? You\u2019re better off going into inflation protected assets. So investors sold off. \n\n\n***\n\nWhen the Fed increases rates, they target something called the Federal Funds rate. I won\u2019t get into the specifics since everyone here is smooth brained, but basically this rate affects all other rates including the 10-yr rate and your smooth brained momma\u2019s 30-yr fixed rate that she bought our house with. \n\n\nThe Fed hasn\u2019t touched rates, yet the 10-yr has essentially exploded because of the bond markets sell off. It\u2019s gone up .5% in two months. \n\n\nThis is very bad because\n***\n1) higher yields make the stock market less attractive and \n2) higher yields absolutely fuck high growth tech stocks. \n***\nTech companies thrive off cheap lending and robust stimulus, so any increase in rates tremendously slows growth. \n\n\n[Bernanke and Kuttner (2005)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00760.x) have a paper that measures the effects of federal reserve interest rate changes on stock market prices. The effects are magnified for tech stocks. There are many papers examining this relationship that you can look up if you\u2019re interested. \n\n***\n# So what happened today?\n\n***\nJPOW spoke and to be honest, I was shocked. He mentioned that the Fed would let inflation run hot in the short term (meaning yields will remain high in the short term) and while he kept repeating that the Fed has a long road ahead, he didn\u2019t commit or mention any sort of policy tools to keep yields low (he might at the next FOMC meeting, but I highly doubt it unless the market implodes further). This is shocking because I was entirely sure the money printer would print and yields would be forced low across the entire yield curve. \n\n\nI strongly believe this is because the Fed is willing to deflate the entire stock market in order to prevent the bubble from inflating anymore. I also believe that the Fed thinks that they can accomplish this while pushing the economy to better employment and reasonably low inflation.\n\n***\n\n\nI think retail will continue to get fucked while yields increase. I don\u2019t think the Fed will institute Yield Curve Controls (YCC) to keep the 10-yr low. I think it\u2019s too experimental and the economy is doing too good to justify using that tool. I think the Fed believes herd immunity will be achieved soon and that implementing such drastic policy right now will contribute massively to inflation in the short term. In other words, they won\u2019t do it. \n\n\nYields will continue to creep up and may level off. Tech will deflate as money exits and goes toward reopening stocks. I believe in tech, but I think the valuations we were seeing a few weeks ago would only be justified if the economy was open AND roaring WITH stimulus coming in. \n\n***\n\nMy plays are going to be all reopening plays. I won\u2019t touch tech unless yields drop precipitously or if the Fed announces they\u2019ll force the 10-yr down. In my opinion, it\u2019s not worth playing musical chairs any longer as there are fewer and fewer seats left. \n\n***\nTLDR: Yields will continue to increase. Tech will get fucked.
