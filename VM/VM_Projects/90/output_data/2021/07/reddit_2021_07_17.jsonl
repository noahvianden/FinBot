You're at the mercy of the  premarket price Monday at 7 am (TD's premarket trading begins).

{"title": "Saucy Play - Ketchup \ud83d\ude09 Kraft Heinze $KHC", "selftext": "**Disclaimer: This is my first DD, and probably terrible enough to be flared as a shitpost**\n\n# CONTEXT: why all the ketchup talk?\n\n>The ketchup thing all started when I posted an image of my Pizza, with ketchup on it, to the weekend thread, only to be bombarded with people telling that ketchup on pizza is fucking psycho. I then confessed to using ketchup on curry, which only made the situation worse for me.\n\nThis led to a wonderful idea... invest in ketchup - specifically Kraft Heinz.\n\n# NASDAQ: KHC - Kraft Heinz\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gt8z47lz7ub71.jpg?width=2400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0eae5de0da63eb365d2eb868bca88a242ab518c5\n\nI'm sure we're all pretty familiar with Kraft Heinz, they manufacture and market food and beverages products internationally. Here's a long list of the kind of products, cuz why the fuck not:\n\n*Condiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats and seafood, frozen and chilled foods, packaged drinking pouches, appetizers, nuts and salted snacks, refreshment beverages, coffee, infant and nutrition products, and other grocery products, as well as desserts, dressings, toppings, and baking. The company offers its products under the Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Heinz, Philadelphia, Velveeta, Lunchables, Planters, Maxwell House, Capri Sun, Ore-Ida, Kool-Aid, Jell-O, ABC, Master, Golden Circle, Quero, Plasmon, Wattie's, Pudliszki, Classico, T.G.I Fridays, and Taco Bell Home Originals brand names.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$KHC currently has a market cap of $48.07 billion, with a share price of $39.30. For you short enthusiasts, there are 20.47 million shares short, which is 3.09% of the float (674.28 million).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Income Statement:\n\n* Revenue - $26.42B\n* Revenue per share - $21.60\n* Quarterly revenue growth (yoy) - 3.80%\n* Gross profit - $9.17B\n* EBITDA - $7.15B\n* Quarterly earnings growth (yoy) - 48.90%\n\n# \n\n# KETCHUP SHORTAGE!\n\nAfter enduring a year of closures (apparently some virus was going around, dunno if you'd heard), many American restaurants are facing a nationwide ketchup shortage. Also, packet prices are up 13% since January 2020.\n\nLong John Silver's LLC, a chain with almost 700 units, had to seek ketchup from secondary suppliers because of the increase in demand. The demand is due to the industry's shift to packets, which has obviously pushed up prices.\n\n*\u201cEveryone out there is grabbing for ketchup,\u201d - Chief Marketing Officer Stephanie Mattingly*\n\nKetchup is the most-consumed table sauce at U.S. restaurants, with approximately 300,000 tons sold to last year, according to research firm Euromonitor. Even more is eaten at home, and the pandemic helped push retail ketchup sales in the US over $1 billion in 2020, around 15% higher than 2019.\n\n# EDIT: Daddy Buffett is also interested!\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, in their Q4 2020 investor letter, said that their position in Kraft Heinz $KHC is the most significant investment accounted for pursuant to the equity method.\n\n>**They're** ***325,442,152 shares*** **deep!**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1x3x7i9daub71.jpg?width=700&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=361b716111a525d07f42288b2f62003ad9703fc8\n\n# WHY HEINZ THO?\n\nHeinz is the king of ketchup, and has been around for over 150 years! They own nearly 70% of America's ketchup market share.\n\nTo keep up with the demand, Steve Cornell, Kraft Heinz's President of Enhancers, Speciality, and Away from Home Business Unit, said the company plans to open new manufacturing lines, increasing production by 25% (12 BILLION packets per year).\n\n# \n\n# PRICE TARGET + FUTURE:\n\nAnalysists estimate a fair value of $83.80, which is a 100%+ increase from the current price of $39.30.\n\nI believe the future is bright, with restaurants reopening, more people travelling, and generally people going out. Wherever you go, if there's a place to buy food, there's most likely the option of Heinz Ketchup.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI currently don't have a position in this stock (to be fair, the idea only came up today, and it's the fucking weekend).
