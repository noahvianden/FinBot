Essentially, Tesla just lost a year when people are trying to catch up.\n\nAdditionally, Elon dropped another bombshell. He said 2/3 iron based and 1/3 nickel based is what he sees in the future as a steady state. This is very concerning because Tesla's 5+ year advantage is in nickel based batteries, not iron based. Chinese manufacturers have more experience with iron based batteries than Tesla has. Furthermore, most of the things revealed on Battery Day don't even apply to iron based batteries, which will likely be prismatic for a while, not cylindrical.\n\nAs a long term Tesla bull that's considered FSD simply icing on the cake, I now consider it roughly half the cake or more, because my faith in the rest of the business has been significantly shaken. If iron based batteries are that important and Tesla has so little IP in that area, what is to keep others from selling a similar enough product? Is selling a slightly better product than others worth $1T or so long term? They really need FSD to work now.\n\nEdit: Iron is LFP. Tesla has very little IP in LFP or prismatic batteries, which pretty much all LFP is. This is what I'm referencing on my second point.\n\nMy first point might not be worrying on its own (who cares about 1 year?) but its worrying combined with the second point because 4680s are set to become a much smaller part of their future, with LFPs taking the forefront, in which Tesla is simply buying from someone else.

Any investor who knows anything about batteries knows that nickel and iron based cathodes are practically slot in replacements for each other. 95% of Tesla's battery advantage in nickel is transferrable to iron based cathodes. Much of the advantage of Tesla's battery tech enhances energy density and lifetime through cathode agnostic innovation. What Elon actually said was they will achieve the density of today's nickel cathodes using iron cathodes. This drops the cost of long range packs by at least 30% vs nickel based competition and eliminates any possibility of supply side limitations on battery production because iron is incredibly abundant.\n\n3.
