This network cost Tesla a fortune to build and they did so because it was a prerequisite to people buying EV's. No one else was seriously doing this. Now, if you have a Tesla you have access to the best charging network.\n\nNext, the grid is not up to task to handle EV's, so Tesla makes home batteries and solar panels that help strengthen the grid and ensure you can charge you EV at home.\n\nTesla also makes a few models of vehicles and they all include, at some expense, the self-driving hardware and computer. This gives Tesla a network like no other to collect data to train self-driving. Even if a third-party were to put this hardware in various automakers cars, the physical differences in each vehicle might mean that the data is not as consistent. Beyond that, can you imagine which automaker would voluntarily include such hardware in cars without it being paid for first? It would mean paying a third party for hardware so the third party can benefit. Basically, the business model to copy what Tesla is doing for self-driving is pretty much non-existent. Self-driving without much explanation is huge and will drive people to buying cars that have the option.\n\nBut step beyond self-driving itself and think about the Boring company, they are building tunnels that are  ideal for self-driving vehicles... Maybe Tesla will license out the self-driving system to other automakers, but regardless for those who want the possibility of accessing such tunnels, well a self-driving car (which will probably be a Tesla or a car that the manufacturer paid a hefty fee to Tesla for) will be a necessity.\n\nWell, self-driving is not so simple because for vehicles with no operator you need reliable communications to prevent a car from not knowing what to do in a place without reception... Well anyone heard about SpaceX's Starlink? If other manufacturers cannot access a reliable source of communications at all times, will their self-driving ever be reliable enough?\n\nAnd finally, what happens when Tesla opens up the cars to Apps?

Already Tesla is doing very well in the luxury car segments, which means Tesla's user base is the ideal user base for someone making an App for Autos that they want to make money off of.\n\nWhatever the exact impact of each point here, what is clear to me that Tesla is revolutionizing what a car is.

In the US, Tesla is at a big pricing disadvantage because it doesn\u2019t get the $7,500 federal rebate. And yet it is crushing the competition. Of course it won\u2019t hold on to 70% market share, but it no one has that kind of share in the long run. 30% would still be huge. In Europe, you neglected the price disadvantage that comes from not having a factory in the EU. If the EU vehicle will cost 5 thousand Euros less that is a big deal. Also, the biggest problem Tesla has right now is lack of Model diversity. It needs more options, especially in the SUV/crossover/estate categories, plus of course a city car.

It's also lower than my own projection of 10 million for Tesla. In order for Tesla not to reach at least 7 million, it will have to dramatically slow down its rate of growth. People have been predicting a permanent flatlining or decline in Tesla sales, but it's been quite a few years now and that has not materialized. What do you think will suddenly happen to stop the growth? People will stop liking the cars that have the highest owner satisfaction ratings by far? People who don't care about or like Musk love the vehicles at a very, very high rate. It's not a small \"cult\" phenomenon.\n\nAs I've said several times, the thing Tesla absolutely must do to keep growing at this rate is expand the range of options in models. In particular, it needs more variety in SUV/crossover/estate/hatchback. It already has world-leading sedans in S and 3.

They have 2 working and 2 under construction. They have \\~7 years to build another 16 factories that need to be about the scale of Austin and larger than Berlin.
