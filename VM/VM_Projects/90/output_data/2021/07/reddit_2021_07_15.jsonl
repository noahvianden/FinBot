Watch the movie the big short and margin call very good movies on the corruption in all aspects of the financial markets. It is going on Today with so called meme stocks.

Very corrupt practice its what happened to toys are us and others. I think retail investors have caught on and are buying stocks of companies hedge funds have been shorting when these hedge funds short a stock they are borrowing shares of a said company with options you pay a premium for an option that gives you a right to buy 100 shares of a company for one option and betting it\u2019s going down in price well when you exercise the option you get those shares and where they make their money is they buy those shares back for a cheaper price and pocket the difference between the borrowed price and where they bought the shares back at the lower price. Where they make the money is they have multiple put options on a company and that can put downward pressure on share price if you have more sellers then buyers prices go down and it is the reverse when you have more buyers then sellers. The sellers can demand higher prices for the shares they own. AMC for instance has been heavily shorted but people have been buying the shares and holding on to them because they know the hedge funds have borrowed shares that they haven\u2019t returned yet and at some point they will have to return the borrowed shares and the hedge funds can be liquidated from their actions.

WOOD dropped from $87.16 to $83.15. So far so good. \n\nTake a look at lumber futures. You will see on May 7th it was trading at $1686. Not the peak. Today trading at $580. This is basically at the July 2020 level.  Inflation in lumber is transitory.\n\nFortunately for us it takes around 90 days for the impact to be felt at the lumber mills and retail outlets. So if you go buy lumber today at home depot you are still paying at the $1686 price.  However this is just starting to change.\n\nWOOD is a lumber ETF. On May 7tn the price was $96.75. Today at $87.16.  One year ago trading at $60.00. You can see the etf has dropped but nowhere near the percentage lumber futures are dropping. That is the opportunity.\n\nThe top 3 holdings on wood:\n\nRayonier RYN. On may 7th was at $37.88. Today at $37.42. One year ago at $27.78. \n\nWeyerhaeuser. WY. . In May at $40. Today at $34.53.  A year ago at 26.11\n\nWEST FRAZER TIMBER. WFG. In May at $86.48. Now at $71. Year ago at $44.56.\n\nAs you can see all these companies are trading at least 25 percent higher than they were a year ago. WOOD is trading at least 30 percent higher. \n\nLumber companies are all getting ready to report earnings. Their numbers will look excellent. However based on the price of lumber dropping we will see them have to give guidance on future earnings. No way can these companies duplicate the record 2nd quarter. I expect to see downgrades and profit taking.  Thus causing the price to dramatically drop. \n\nPosition. PUTS on WOOD. November expiration. 90 strike. Premiums at $5.00. \n\nPredict that WOOD drops to at least $70.00.

{"title": "Inflation is beginning to rage because of massive money printing and the price of real things like commodities is soaring.", "selftext": "  \n\nWith inflation beginning to rage because of massive money printing real things like commodities and precious metals become a serious consideration for investment to help keep up with real inflation and preserve your wealth.\n\nMassive money printing has increased the supply of money but the supply of commodities has not increased and in many cases has decreased due to supply constraints caused by the pandemic and when you have an increased supply of money chasing the same amount or fewer commodities the obvious response from the market is for prices to rise which is exactly what has happened with many commodities experience significant price increases well above the Governments declared inflation rates.\n\nThe price of typical inflation indicators like gold and silver has been suppressed but it is a completely different matter to suppress the price of industrial commodities which tend to react more readily to real market supply and demand dynamics.\n\n**The King USD cycle is over**. While the USD is rising commodities are psychologically linked to it and are not free to rise to the natural price set by innate supply and demand. But, when that cycle is over the gravity headwind inverts and becomes a tailwind. With the DXY at about 93 the USD has stopped being the foot on the neck of all metals. \n\nBelow is just one example of a metal that is coming to life and benefitting from the covid effect and all the money printing by Governments is beginning to flow into previously ignored sectors like metals which have been undervalued for years.\n\nMotorists drive up prices for battery metal lead\n\nLONDON, July 6 (Reuters) - A jump in demand for traditional lead-acid car batteries and lingering freight problems have created shortages that have been felt most acutely in the huge U.S. automotive sector and driven up lead prices globally.\n\nWhile other battery metals, such as lithium and cobalt, have been in demand for electric vehicles, replacement batteries for vehicles powered by internal combustion engines account for half of global demand in the 12 million tonne lead market.\n\nThe United States accounts for 13% of global lead demand, but consumption has been boosted by the end of COVID-19 lockdowns as motorists seek replacements for lead-acid batteries that have failed after long periods without use.\n\nPrices were also boosted last week by rumours of a lead refinery declaring force majeure, analysts and traders said, though no such news subsequently emerged.\n\n\"The rumours pushed up prices, but so far there has been no substance behind it,\" said Wood Mackenzie analyst Farid Ahmed. \"Demand for replacement batteries in the U.S. has been white hot and also strong in Europe.\"\n\nBenchmark lead hit its highest since July 2018 at $2,344 a tonne on June 30.\n\nWood Mackenzie expects demand for lead for replacement car batteries to rise 5.9% from 2020 to 6.5 million tonnes this year, back to pre-pandemic levels, Ahmed said.\n\nThis jump in demand coupled with transport delays has boosted U.S. lead premiums, which are paid top of benchmark LME prices in the physical market, to a record high of $375 a tonne .\n\nRobust demand and resulting shortages have also triggered draws on stocks in warehouses registered with the London Metal Exchange (LME) , the world's biggest exchange for visible lead stocks. Those stocks are down more than 40% this year at 72,250 tonnes.\n\nIn the first four months of the year, the global refined lead market was in a surplus of 19,000 tonnes, compared with 30,000 tonnes in the same period last year, data from the International Zinc and Lead Study Group showed.\n\nPart of the reason behind shortages is tight concentrate supplies. This can be seen in treatment charges paid by miners to process concentrate into refined metal, dropping to their lowest since September 2019 at $50 a tonne this month, according to an assessment by Asia Metals.\n\nThe following pdf has valuation by Rawson Lewis that details effect from increased lead prices on value. [https://boabmetals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BML\\_-Market-Missing-Impact-of-Rising-Lead-Prices\\_Rawson-Lewis\\_-210709.pdf](https://boabmetals.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/BML_-Market-Missing-Impact-of-Rising-Lead-Prices_Rawson-Lewis_-210709.pdf)\n\nThere is likely to be strong demand for Boab Metals (ASX:BML)   Sorby Hills concentrates as there is a desire from customers ( like JV Partner) who are seeking a clean lead-silver concentrate free from deleterious elements to offset the closure of a number of lead mines in China. They will probably sell most of it to their JV partner Henang Yuguang Gold & Lead Co. Ltd, the biggest lead and silver smelterer in China. They will likely be paid upfront through offtake agreements for a large whack of it to help them progress to production.\n\nYuguang has reaffirmed their strong appetite for the Sorby Hills Lead Silver concentrate and potentially increasing their offtake participation above that which they are currently entitled by virtue of their 25% joint venture interest in the Project\n\nThe Joint Venture partners have agreed to accelerate the finalisation of the Sorby Hills Development and Operations Agreement to facilitate engagement with project financiers.", "id": "ol4y1n", "created_utc": 1626392936.0, "score": 70, "upvote_ratio": 0.74, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|2 days ago\n**Total Comments**|4|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|4 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22770680487155914}, {"body": "What about the prices of hookers and Coke?", "score": 44, "replies": [{"body": "Prices will remain the same but the quality will decrease.

The inflation rate reported looks year over year, and Covid resulted in significant deflation, so any inflation seen has to have a major asterisk associated. If you look back at CPI for the last 3 years and calculate the compounded growth rate from then to now, inflation is sitting pretty nicely at 2.4%. Sure it looks like 5%+ compared to 2020, but again, we had severe deflationary pressures that year. Overall we just appear to be bouncing back to the normal trendline.\n2. We've been printing money for literally decades. Until Covid happened, the concern was that inflation wasn't high *enough.* Correlation isn't causation, but we have enough data to infer that deficits don't drive inflation on their own; if they did, we'd have had a crisis by 2004.\n3. The money we're printing isn't excess money; it's money helping people and companies scrape by. The majority of people haven't suddenly found themselves with tons of money to spend, which would drive up inflation (via demand).\n4. Related to the above, deficits & money printing drive inflation when unemployment is low or nill, and unemployment is not low right now. We're a long way from the broad consumer base having the kind of money to drive inflation.\n\nAgain - we do have inflationary concerns in certain sectors driven by supply chain issues. And if you want to know where all that money has gone, I don't know that I could  say with certainty, but income inequality has grown tremendously over this entire period of deficit spending (again, going back decades), leading me to believe that the extra money is going to the wealthiest people and corporations, all of whom are more interested in both growing that wealth via the market and saving. Wealthy people don't drive inflation; the broader economy does.\n\nAt the least, I do feel confident saying: we're very explicitly in a comfortable range of inflation based on trendlines prior to Covid.

A lot of us middle class to lower middle class trying to pick over the scraps trying to make do with what we have and \"get by\" or maybe trying to buy something nice like......*(insert anything here) and its price is much higher than 18 months ago but most folks have not seen their wages increase enough to offset that. The corporations and the rich got their money back and then RAISED prices! And the average american accepts the price hike and buys it anyways at the higher price. \n\nScrew that. I plan to do with out. Unless i really really need it.....i am only buying clothes from discount stores and no more new or used cars for a few years. Restaurants? I will minimize eating out. Groceries? Nope. I will do more fasting or just eat smaller portions. I will not spend more than my budget just because corporate greed wants more money.

Prices aren't much higher in aggregate than 18 months ago. Again - we're seeing a steady 2.4% inflation trend. Certain sectors are seeing big inflation thanks to supply chain issues.
