Here's a few examples we'd use in the CF (armoured reconnaissance):\n\n- shadows: A car infront of another car still casts its shadow and you can use that to calculate it's speed and distance relative to the vehicle that's blocking your vision. I do this in my own car while driving now. A camera based system could infer the same information off that shadow as well.\n\n- reflections: mirrors, puddles, anything at your disposal to collect data. We would use headlight reflections off of store Windows to get a bit of an edge and advance warning. Lidar just shoots right through glass, and radar just bounces off it like any other surface. It takes advanced tech for lidar to discern glass properly, while a camera based system can tell pretty quickly.\n\n- light: if it's nighttime especially; a vehicles lights will give off its position, speed, direction traveling, better than any radar/lidar would ever be able to do. You probably do this now in your own vehicle when you turn your HighBeams off preemptively before cars crest over a hill, or turn a corner so you don't blind them. Cars with the vision based sensors already have auto-dimming tech for High Beams based off of oncoming traffic light. Lidar isn't going to do that.\n\n- thermal signature: lidar/radar isn't going to pick up thermal signatures. Where as cameras such as FLIR or generalized thermal camera could potentially drive you through a snowstorm, as the more sensitive ones could tell the difference in temperature of the road paint, and lane lines that an autonomous vehicle could use to navigate during low visability situations. Could also give advanced warning for deer and other animals. Lidar and radar aren't going to do shit in a snowstorm, as all the individual snowflakes would be picked up as clutter.

Down a fair bit today, but still within tolerance (as theta is still solidly positive for the spreads). Just adjusted from 9 shares down to 7 shares (could have added another put spread, but margin use was higher than I'd like after it's dropped so much, so better to reduce margin usage rather than increase it). If it keeps going down I'll probably buy those back at a lower cost (or add another bullish spreads).

Not as long as I'd like a few weeks (about a month now), as I've been refining it quite a bit. I've been running something similar to it for about a year now, I've been refining it to reduce flaws.\n\nThe original version was the same idea, but used only stock, but that only works well if the stock is moving enough (realized volatility, though it works rather well for some of the stocks I had as some went up like 80% in a few weeks). A half year or so back I used essentially the wheel strategy, but that rather limits your options and has massive downside in the case of a crash, but the theta positive aspect of it was useful and I liked the general concept behind the wheel strategy, so I incorporated that into it, but switched to spreads stock about a month ago to allow for using it on higher priced stocks (which the method works better on anyway). This also greatly reduces the need to setup an auto-trader to handle the the buys/sells to maximize efficiency (in the case of the stock on strategy)\n\nThe next phase is probably changing the take profit 50% max profit limit to an OTA order so after it fills it creates a new order (market order) that will fill in the lost delta from closing the position (via buying more shares in the case of bullish spreads and selling them in the case of bearish) until I can open a new options position, as without an auto-trader it's not practical to autoroll (and I'm not sure it's refined enough to setup an auto-trader for). The issue being that in the case of a spike in price, it's changing delta in the opposite way you'd want it to.\n\nI've also looked into OTM spreads or long puts/calls on the ends in case of spikes in the stock price, but they don't seem cost effective.\n\nAs an update the short side of the 645 is now OTM so theta is a bit negative there. I'm debating on rolling it or leaving it open for now, didn't get a chance to yesterday, so we'll see how it looks today and roll if TSLA is on the way down again. Rolling it would reduce the effect of delta as it moves the goal post, but would increase fees, and may not be ideal if it's it's transitory.\n\nIf you look at my history you can find somewhere I detailed the method a bit more as someone was using something very similar with similar goals.\n\nLike the wheel strategy, this is something best ran for a long time, so even a few months would be a bit light.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": ["crash", "tsla"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1864442229270935}], "tickers": ["tsla"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "I did an TOS \u201cON Demand\u201d back test on this from 1/19 to current day..

Proterra has three complementary businesses:\n\n* **Proterra Powered**: Delivering industry-leading battery systems and electrification solutions to commercial vehicle manufacturers;\n* **Proterra Transit:** Leading North America as the market\u2019s #1 electric transit bus OEM; and\n* **Proterra Energy:** Offering end-to-end turnkey charging and energy management solutions.\n\nThe Company\u2019s industry-leading battery systems have been proven in more than 16 million service miles driven by its fleet of transit vehicles and validated through partnerships with world-class commercial vehicle OEMs, such as Freightliner Custom Chassis Corporation (FCCC), Thomas Built Buses, Van Hool, Bustech, and Optimal-EV. To date, Proterra has produced and delivered more than 300 megawatt-hours of battery systems, more than 550 heavy-duty electric transit buses and installed 54 megawatts of charging systems.\n\nProterra operates manufacturing facilities in California and South Carolina, as well as a state-of-the-art R&D lab in Silicon Valley. The Company recently announced the opening of a new battery production line co-located in its electric transit bus manufacturing facility in Los Angeles County. This battery production line was established within a year and demonstrates Proterra\u2019s ability to bring its scalable and capital-efficient battery manufacturing process directly to commercial vehicle OEMs alongside their existing manufacturing.\" Pulled from [investors portal on Proterra's website](https://www.proterra.com/company/investors/).\n\n**Investors:**\n\nFranklin Templeton, Broadscale, 40 North, G2VP, Chamath Palihapitiya, and Fidelity Management & Research Company LLC\n\n**Funds and Accounts Managed By:**\n\nBlackRock, Neuberger Berman Funds and affiliates of ArcLight.\n\nLeadership\n\n* Jack Allan, CEO, from Navistar and Valspar\n* Amy Ard, CFO, from AMG, PCC, and PWC\n* Dustin Grace, CTO, from Tesla and Honda\n* John Ensign, COO, from Tesla and Honeywell\n* JoAnn Covington, CLO, from EA and Rocket Fuel\n* Gareth Joyce, President, from Delta and Mercedes-Benz\n* Rick Huibregtse, Sr. VP Engineering, from Remy and Delphi\n* John Walsh, Sr. VP of Sales, from Rev and Davey Coach\n\nBoard of Directors\n\n* Jack Allen, Chairman from Navistar and Valspar\n* Ryan Popple, Co-Founder and Executive Director from Tesla and KPCB\n* Jake Erhard, Direct Nominee from ArcLight and Schroders\n* Jennifer Granholm, Director **Secretary of the DoE** and CNN (former Board Director)\n* Constance Skidmore, Director from PWC\n* Mike Smith, Director from Constellation\n* Brook Porter, Director from G2VP and KPCB\n* Jeannine Sargent, Director from Flex and Aerlikon\n\nI can't highlight Jennifer Granholm enough, she is the Secretary of the Department of Energy with a green Biden administration in a company that has 50% of the US Market already.

With an incredible first-mover advantage (16mm driven/10 years production) and a massive lead on the market (50%+ US market share), there is nothing stopping this stock from absolutely exploding.\n\nThe company is currently undervalued by 100.18% on fundamentals alone, and that's on the \"fair\" end. When people realize what is actually happening here and what this is about to become, I think the hype and excitement has the potential to drive these prices much higher. I see a TSLA situation brewing. No not because it's just another EV company, because it's an established, well-connected, constantly growing *commercial* EV company.\n\n**How to Play?**\n\nShares and a couple Aug and Dec calls.
