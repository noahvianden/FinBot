In order to do that we have to reduce spending in the economy. That means raising interest rates along with some other things. When that happens there is less borrowing (which also results in less spending) because debt is now more expensive. That results in more money paid on debt and less spent in the economy.

Ray Dalio is a well known fed hawk whose golden butterfly strategy relies on high interest rates and low inflation to return predictable spending money to multigenerational trust fund kids.  If the dollar and bonds crash and gold stagnates he is totally fucked.  Hedge fund managers like him use media like CNBC to push an agenda forward and would never give free advice without some profit in mind, and Dalio is no different.  His incentives are not aligned with your incentives.\n\nContrary to what Dalio is saying, in previous bouts of hyperinflation assets (like stocks) become overvalued and inflate together with the prices of other things.  In fact, when the Weimar Republic suffered hyperinflation in the 20\u2019s their stock market (priced in marks) skyrocketed (https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-happened-to-stocks-during-the-german-hyperinflation-2011-11?amp).\n\nSo then what is going on in the stock market today with inflation concerns?  Well, it\u2019s more about how net present value is calculated and the time-value of money than it is about economic activity decreasing.  As inflation increases, the value of future earnings (aka net present value or NPV) decreases because the discount rate investors are willing accept for those future earnings must also increase.  Ie,. If you expected higher internet rates in the future, why would you lock yourself in to a lower return coming from a company\u2019s future earnings?  So companies that offer opportunities for future growth in their baseline valuation are immediately worth less.  This means that in inflationary environments, markets get far more short sighted and focused on near term earnings than growth.  Note that even today value investments with huge present earnings (companies like COST or AAPL) are soaring while companies with future earnings potential growth are tanking.\n\nIn the event of hyperinflation, the best assets to own tend to be those that create earnings today that can keep up with inflation.  That is the market action you\u2019ve seen recently.  However In the last few months the action we\u2019ve seen (bonds and USD rallying) seems to indicate an expectation for unwinding inflation actually.\n\nWatch the price action of specific assets to draw your economic narrative, not to Wall Street hedge fund managers.

Let's simplify the world and say that a growth company is a company that makes a 1MM profit 10 years from now and a value company is a company that makes a 1MM profit 1 year from now. If somehow inflation were to stick to 5% a year for 10 years, then that growth company's profit is worth 1MM / ((1 + 5%)^(10)) = 0.61MM in today's money (compared to 0.82MM if inflation were 2% a year for 10 years) and that value company's profit is worth 0.95MM.\n\nOf course, this is oversimplified because the discount rate really reflects opportunity cost rather than the actual value of money so you have to be looking at the yield you can get off a 10 year risk free bond to rationally value that future cash flow, but those two rates should track each other.

The natural spirit of Americans is \"I'm gonna do whatever the hell I want, & if you tell me I can't do something I'm gonna do it just to prove a point\" with that being said 1) the reaction to omicron is already baked in, we saw a dip upon initial news, then a slight rebound for lack of better terms shortly after. They've already(at lightning speed i might add) came out with a 4th shot to combat the \"not so bad\" variant. \n\n2) JPow is typically really passive and I think that's because he's really trying to let the natural order of things occur with minimal intrusion. Think about it, the tapering in & of itself isn't gonna drastically change much, they're not gonna increase rates back to the good old days of 10% cds & what not , so it isn't as if rates are gonna sky rocket over the next few years. A slight increase isn't going to really stop/ dramatically change anything going on right now. I watch loan rates on cars, personal loans, homes etc, they haven't done a whole lot in fact car loan rates are stupidly low right now. Plus you have the infrastructure bill which is gonna stimulate the economy as well. You gotta admit that's pretty interesting how that happened. Jpow stalled stalled stalled then boom infrastructure package to get folks back working which will get the money flowing more, which will trigger spending(Americans love to do) and boom what rate hikes? Perfect timing...\n\nWhich brings me to my last point 3) Americans utterly refuse to be broke(i mean this loosely as a whole), you see how ppl rebelled against staying home unable to make money & buy stuff despite the risks. The govt isn't about to repeat that mistake. It's been almost 2 years & unemployment is pretty much gone. So now folks are about to slowly start getting back to work cause that pipe dream of sitting at home making money ain't for everybody. Most ppl lack the discipline. They're gonna pickup a shovel& start building/ improving these roads. \n\nWith rates & tapering it's just a shift in gears that has folks panties all in a bunch. But that's nothing new when something out of the norm is announced. In this instance the norm was free easy money, now its just slightly less easy & a tad bit more expensive. But rates on assets are still pretty low,  it's the unsecured stuff that's been getting jacked up.
