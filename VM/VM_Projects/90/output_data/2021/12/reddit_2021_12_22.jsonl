This is a trade that was brought to my attention by a fried of mine. In late august he shared a really interesting idea with a ton of alpha and in this post I will be taking you through how he found it, the thesis he came up with and how he priced it out.\n\nAnd to give you an idea of how big this trade was, between those I personally knew who were in the trade, *we had a combined -30,000 vega exposure*.\n\n***Note: If you want to read all the parts of my options guide,*** [***click here***](https://classic-desert-4cb.notion.site/Ultimate-Guide-to-Selling-Options-061ca90e28cc494eb855de5ce398af7e) ***for a list of my posts.***\n\n# The Opportunity:\n\nIn July and August of 2021 was when tensions with China really started to grow. The Evergrande crisis was in full swing, companies were under pressure from the Chinese government, and foreign relations with China seemed a bit more uncertain than usual.\n\n[KWEB down 35&#37; when we began looking into this trade](https://preview.redd.it/c7nt8lda14781.png?width=860&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b774a79fa2f93490990b8a71aac1d95e0503209)\n\nWe saw Chinese stocks take a massive hit, down about 35% in just a few weeks.\n\n# The trade involved selling volatility on KWEB, which is the China Internet Index.\n\nIt consists of China based companies whose primary business is focused on internet products/services (Similar companies to Google, FB, Twitter, Amazon, etc).\n\nAt first glance, a high level of volatility seems pretty justified. But remember, high volatility and expensive volatility are not the same thing. For example, implied volatility could be *too high*.\n\n# Most traders would't go near a situation like this...\n\nBut it is precisely these types of situations that can create opportunity for us to find really big edges.\n\nYou see, markets are pretty efficient. There are many smart players. But when things get shaken up, efficiency decreases and a few dollars fall through the cracks for smart traders to scoop up.\n\n# Understanding the opportunities around distressed market situations\n\nBefore we get into the trade research, we need to understand the scenario.\n\nHere's an analogy I used when trying to explain it to someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Amazon ships close to 1.6 million products every day. Can you imagine how efficient an amazon warehouse is?  \n>  \n>They have spent huge amounts of time and money perfecting every single process in their massive warehouses. Items flow perfectly from shelves to trucks to get sent out to customers.  \n>  \n>*Now, imagine that there was a small fire in one section of the warehouse.*  \n>  \n>Of course that one section would need repairs, but it would also impact the work flow for the rest of the warehouse. What was once a perfectly efficient system now has many faults, bottlenecks, etc.  \n>  \n>If you were a junior operations manager, you would have a hard time finding areas to improve the amazon warehouse on a regular day. But on the day of a fire, you would probably be able to point out the bottlenecks caused by the situation.  \n>  \n>*The chaos created opportunity for you to make a difference.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# This isn't too different from the market.\n\nOn any regular day, it is difficult for retail traders to price markets more efficiently than other market participants (there are some very, very smart people who are paid huge sums of money to play).\n\n*But when a \"fire\" happens, things can get really out of line.*\n\nWhile most people run away from these opportunities, smart retail traders take a serious look at them and sometimes find hidden gems that others overlook.\n\nThat's what this trade is based on.\n\n# Initial Research\n\nThe first thing we did was try to understand the situation in China. We spent a good amount of time looking into Evergrande, when the news hit the market, how the situation has evolved. We looked into the political and economic landscape in China too.\n\nThere was certainly some cause for concern in the market. But thing were already taking a hit, and the question that we needed to answer was *whether or not the current level of implied volatility was justified.*\n\n# Analyzing IV on KWEB\n\nSince this was a trade I took in the past, I have set my graph to look back in time as to how volatility looked on August 24th, 2021.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Huge spike in volatility back in July, then it came down. It began to rally again in August. This happened across all expirations.](https://preview.redd.it/o9z57nvf14781.png?width=1786&format=png&auto=webp&s=b51b684a1e217f04e9955a9900a1dffaeae2fca4)\n\nLooking at a few different expirations, we could see the rapid increase in IV when the news first broke in July, and then a second pump in August.\n\n# It looks like all the different expirations moved similarly, but let's take a closer look..\n\nLet's start off by taking a look at the 30 and 60 day options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The August pump was not as much as the July pump for near dated options.](https://preview.redd.it/8xbh9yii14781.png?width=1790&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1f8a7b2a794d5f9c687c8cd754d07ed05e5b320)\n\nFirst we noticed how it initially had a big spike, then cooled off, and then spiked back up to around the same levels. It's almost as if gamma is being priced in the same now as it was when the first big move happened.\n\nThe key word here is *almost* the same levels.\n\nHowever, when we look at the 1 year DTE options, we saw something different:\n\n[The August pump was more than the July pump for far dated options.](https://preview.redd.it/f08lqrin14781.png?width=1788&format=png&auto=webp&s=2de8bde6b1aae6440dd2c15181e8eeedd17e5db0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt continued to make new highs, approaching 45% IV!\n\nEverything else approached the highs, but longer dated volatility expanded much higher!\n\nIf longer dated options changed in price similar to everything else, we might have seen these at around 37-38% volatility.\n\nIf we plot the term structure at the two highs, we can see this more clearly.\n\n[Comparing July and August term structures shows the change clearly.](https://preview.redd.it/zpcz67yq14781.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=69f4dd3fcabf560832c2ff5030f91353e522aac8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can see how on July 27, every expiration had higher IV than on August 24, except for the 1 year (and 2 year, just not on the chart) options.\n\n# What could cause something like this?\n\nAt first glance, it looked like there was a big reach for vega here, but there isn't much liquidity.\n\nWhat I mean is that it looks like somebody is trying to build a position out in the longer dated options to get long vega exposure, but because there is low liquidity on these longer dated options, *they might be getting bid up more than they should*.\n\n# Off the bat, this was something I wanted to look deeper into. So from there we started to look into some of the stocks that KWEB is holding.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[BIDU, JD, BABA, TCOM 1 year implied volatilities. All trading around 42-43&#37;.](https://preview.redd.it/o4pe9mgw14781.png?width=2302&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcb12a9a14951afe4ab093dfe14bbe0b97e71a1d)\n\nI wanted to see what the 1 year IV was for some of the holdings in KWEB. So we plotted the IVs for BIDU, BABA, JD, and TCOM.\n\nTo our surprise, **they are trading** ***below*** **the IV of the ETF**.\n\nThis was really interesting because the single name implied volatilities should be higher than the implied volatility of the ETF.\n\n# ETF IV should be lower than it's components\n\nLet's use a basic example to understand this:\n\nImagine you go to a food market, and individual apples are going for $1 each. Right next to it, a basket of 10 apples is going for $11.\n\nClearly something is wrong here, right?\n\nWe see something similar in the market. ETF Volatility should not be trading higher than the implied volatility of its components when we consider them all together.\n\nAnd even then, it should not be equal. *The ETF should have lower implied volatility.*\n\nThe reason for this is because the ETF is composed of many individually moving parts. The components of an ETF are independent from each other.\n\nThis means that when one goes down, another stock in the ETF could go up, or down less. The movement of different stocks within the ETF can counterbalance each other, lowering the overall movement of the ETF.\n\n# In short, ETF volatility should be less than the sum of its components because of diversification.\n\nThe more correlated the stocks in an ETF are, the less diversification and therefore volatility. On the flip side, less correlation means the ETF volatility will be lower\n\nIf ETF implied volatility is similar to its component's volatility, then the market is implying a high correlation between the stocks in the ETF\n\n# Our hypothesis evolved.\n\nOur theory became that KWEB implied vols were so high that the stocks in the ETF would have to be extremely correlated for KWEB to actually be this volatile.\n\nIf KWEB was implying too high of a correlation between the stocks it is made up of, we could sell volatility on KWEB, betting on the implied correlation decreasing, and therefore the implied volatility decreasing for the ETF!\n\nOnce the market realizes that the ETF is more diversified than it seems at the moment, implied vol would fall.\n\n# So to dig deeper, my friend created a spreadsheet of all the holdings in KWEB.\n\nHe took note of the company, % of the fund it represented, and the 2 year implied volatility for it.\n\n[Spreadsheet containing all the components of KWEB, how much of the fund they accounted for and their IVs](https://preview.redd.it/klbutxmyhx681.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc01dbb0dc5c06325bc182e84a997de9bc3e4e83)\n\nSome of the stocks didn't have options for them. But luckily, this only represented 4% of the fund. Also, we were able to use Bloomberg to fill in some of the blanks by looking at what the options were trading at in Hong Kong for some of the ones that weren't trading options in the US.\n\nFor example, Tencent was trading at 34% IV for December 2022.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[We used Bloomberg to grab the volatilities for stocks not trading options in the US](https://preview.redd.it/ctdan2tmix681.png?width=1276&format=png&auto=webp&s=95a1c9d028cefd7bf4495b8259d464567df3b2f5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*So what's the point of collecting all this data?*\n\n# The purpose is to calculate the implied correlation of the ETF, so we determine if it's pricing in enough diversification.\n\nI'll do another post on calculating implied correlation in depth. But for the time being..\n\nTo calculate implied correlation we need 3 things:\n\n1. Implied volatility for all the ETF components\n2. Weights for all the ETF components\n3. The IV of the ETF itself\n\nGiven all of this information, we can calculate what the implied correlation of the ETF is.\n\nWe ran the numbers and got an implied correlation of 76% for the 2 year options. Which is VERY high.\n\nTo give you an idea of how high it is, here is the implied correlations for other ETFs at that time:\n\n[Implied correlations for different ETFs](https://preview.redd.it/ghruet5ljx681.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=0706e79d2506cadbdcce5d84725b3c4f0a3bfe4f)\n\nBased on the above, we are usually seeing between 34-50% implied correlation. On KWEB, we are seeing 76%!\n\nSo we have to ask ourselves.. *\"Do we really think the stocks in KWEB will be 76% correlated over the next year or two? And if the real correlation will be lower, what does that mean for KWEB vols?\"*\n\n# Another one of the questions we need to answer is: What do we think implied correlation should be?\n\nLet's say we think the fair implied correlation is 45%. We can change equation to see what it IV should be if our view on implied correlation is correct.\n\nif the basket has an implied correlation of 45%, then the fair value of IV on the ETF today is 37%.\n\n# With that being said, we need to determine if 45% correlation is fair value.\n\nOne way to do this is to look at the historic realized correlation for KWEB. Another is to compare it to realized correlation for other ETFs (*sound familiar*? it's an absolute and relative value analysis... like we normally do for volatility).\n\nHere's the realized correlations for some ETFs.\n\n[Realized correlations for different ETFs](https://preview.redd.it/09w119bhmx681.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=63460f088dc4d94599c67e642e1723d738965a28)\n\nAfter looking at the realized implied correlation for KWEB too (Can't find graph right now, will update later), our view was that fair value for implied correlation was between 45-50%, and therefore implied volatility should be between 35-40%.\n\n# Our View\n\nImplied volatility for longer dated options on KWEB is currently trading around 45%. We believe the fair value is between 35-40%.\n\nWe expected that it would take 3-4 weeks for implied volatility to come down to our fair value.\n\n# Trade structure\n\nThere are a couple of different ways to trade ideas like this.\n\nFor example, if I were a large hedge fund, and wanted to take on less risk, what I could do is a dispersion trade.\n\nI would try to create a copy of the ETF to try and replicate its volatility. I would buy the component's volatility, and sell the ETF volatility.\n\nBasically, this would equate to buying the realized correlation, selling the implied correlation, and capturing the spread between the two.\n\nHowever, this is more capital intensive and a bit overkill for us retail traders.\n\n# I prefer to pack on a bit more heat when I find a big edge.\n\nSo we decided to go outright short vega, and sell volatility on KWEB.\n\nOf those I knew who took the trade, we all structured it a bit differently. I personally chose to sell the January 2023 $58 straddles.\n\nWith this trade structure, I was leaning slightly positive delta. I had very little theta or gamma, and a LOT of vega. Basically, as long as the stock didn't trend to hard in one direction, I had a pretty linear trade.\n\nIf IV increased, I would lose money. If IV decreased, I would make money.\n\nI decided that I would cut losses if IV increased to 50% and I would aim to take profits around 36% IV.\n\n# How the trade progressed, and how I managed it\n\nAs time passed, the stock began to chop around. The stock price would go from $50, up to $53, and down to $47.  Implied volatility would increase or decrease by a couple points each week.\n\nDuring this period, I chose not to delta hedge. If it had gone much further, I would have, but I chose to embrace some of the variance and it ended up working well for me, as price kept coming back to around the $50 mark.\n\nOthers had a much more strict threshold for delta hedging, and in the case, it ended up costing them a fair amount of the profit. When you are short volatility, each time you delta hedge you lock a profit.\n\nNow, this trade ended up taking longer than I expected it to. I ended up holding the position for about 2 months.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Implied volatility came down to 39&#37;!](https://preview.redd.it/pk28h9a524781.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=41bd76032eeaf25ded65efbe5330750c6c8e3d28)\n\nIn September we saw implied volatility come down to around 39.5% and then rally back up to around 42%. Towards the end of October, it came back down to 38-39%, at which point I chose to exit. Over the same time period, price chopped around but ended almost exactly where it was upon entry. So I did not lose much on delta.\n\n[Price stayed relatively flat!](https://preview.redd.it/7kjkrux7ky681.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd50be2c2e763794f86b3af3c69fc7c4871b9935)\n\nThe reason I exited earlier than my intended profit is that I had a lot of capital tied up in this position. Back when there was a lot of edge left in the trade, I was happy to stay in, but at this point better trades had come along and I decided to reallocate that capital.\n\n# Trade Results\n\nI sold the January 2023 $58 straddle for about $23 each. I bought the straddle back for $19 each.\n\nMy profit on the trade was $4 ($400) per straddle I sold. Given that I thought this trade had high expected value, I was confident enough to size up on this position, so that my actual dollar return was quite substantial!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nSomething that I want to make clear is that I do not go out of my way to make things complicated. At first glance it may sound like it is, but we are really just combining the concepts of diversification and relative value.\n\nTrading is a competition. It's those who have the knowledge, creativity and experience to explore ideas and identify the best ones that get paid.\n\n# Recently, I asked one of my favourite traders a question:\n\n# Are there any high capacity strategies that you think traders can run that have high expectancy?\n\n# Here is his response:\n\n*\"Maybe the reason is that I perceive a disconnect between the way I understand trading and the way that it's commonly understood by non-professionals.*\n\n*There seems to be a strong desire to have a \"sushi menu\" of trades and strats that you can pick from, plug some numbers in or do some searches, and somehow come out with a +EV set of trades at the end.*\n\n*But I have no reason to believe that approach works. IME, good trades and strats are precisely the things that you've thought about from first principles, or discovered by staring at markets, or were taught by someone who has a strong vested interest in your success.*\n\n*The process by which you transform random ideas into +EV strats IS the hard stuff.
