{"title": "P/E ratio isn't everything, but it would do a lot of good for some people to take it in consideration when investing", "selftext": "I see so many people on this sub and other finance-related subs recommend certain stocks simply because they're great companies. A lot of people seem to fail to realize the fact that the expected growth and development of some companies is already priced into their stock price and that their investment isn't as valuable as they might think. This is especially relevant if you're in those companies for the long run, and not just trying to hedge some profits out of short term price movements.\n\nTwo major examples of those kinds of overvalued stocks (in my opinion) come to my mind: Costco ($COST) and Nvidia ($NVDA).\n\n$COST: Costco is currently trading with a P/E ratio of almost 50 (so their annual earnings are close 1/50 or 2% of their market cap). However, the average P/E ratio in the sector of consumer services is in the 20's. That doesn't directly mean that Costco is a bad investment, but it means that Costco must be expected to grow bloody rapidly within the next few years for it to be worth its current trade price. The thing is, Costco is already an established company with a limited potential for further growth as its already at the top of its sector and gives a lot of its earnings away in the form of dividends instead of reinvesting them into their development. Does that mean that Costco is overvalued at the moment? There can't be an objective answer to that, but you better have a damn good reason to think it's still worth it to invest in Costco, and not just that it's a great company.\n\n$NVDA: Nvidia is currently trading at a P/E ratio around 100 while the average P/E for tech stocks is of 35. Again, you must have a really good reason to think Nvidia, who's already at the top of the GPU market, is gonna grow rapidly within the few next years when it has competitors like AMD and Intel slowly catching up to its technlogical edge and who are slowly taking away some of its market share. Does that mean that Nvidia is overvalued? Even an insidier could have trouble telling you, but again, you must have a really solid reason to think it's still a worth it investment.\n\nLong term investing is all about value. You're trying to find best deals in the market basically. When you do your reasearch about a company, you're trying to evaluate it and compare the intrinsic value you think it has to the value it is given by the market. A good analogy would be if you had a slight preference to Burger King over McDonald's, but Burger King's food was twice as expensive as McDonald's'. Would you still eat at Burger King? No, you'd most likely go to McDonald's because Burger King might taste a bit better, but not enough to justify its way higher price.\n\nAnother thing: I see so many people recommend stocks based on the success they've had in the past with them. It's not because that stock has been great value in the past that it will still great value in the future. The thing that annoys me the most is people that recommend buying Tesla because it's been a successful company. To be clear, Tesla has been a successful company, but the increase in its stock price didn't even nearly scale proportionately to its success. With a P/E ratio of 400, it's easy to see that the increase in Tesla's stock price was caused by the faith of investors in the company's future success and not by its past feats. In brief, the fact that a lot of people believe in a company doesn't mean that it's actually as good a company as its value tells you.", "id": "rritf4", "created_utc": 1640812193.0, "score": 160, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 83, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 48, "replies": [{"body": "I absolutely agree with your point.

It seems like you're making a ton of generalities. Many companies are sacrificing current profits to innovate. There is growing competition across all sectors.
