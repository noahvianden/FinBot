The timing of the patent sale announcement. He used a couple interesting phrases including \u201cMost likely by Christmas\u201d and \u201cOur investors will be very pleased\u201d. I work in finance (this is not financial advice, do your own DD yada) and it\u2019s obviously hard to time the market, but this play is served up on a silver platter. At these levels with strong support at $9 and catalysts on the horizon, I like the risk/reward here. I\u2019m both short term bullish and long term on BB\u2019s turnaround story but rarely see such a great setup for a short term play.\n\nFor all you \u201ciT\u2019s PriCed In!\u201d turds, it\u2019s not. The details and magnitude of patent sales this size are rare and unknown. There are no wallstreet/hedgefund models to price it in. Can it surprise to the downside? Of course. But that\u2019s why we\u2019re all playing this fun game aren\u2019t we. \n\nAnother catalyst- January 5th to the 8th 2022 is the CES Tech Conference in which BB is participating (along with MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, FB and more) to showcase their IVY tech and upcoming projects.
