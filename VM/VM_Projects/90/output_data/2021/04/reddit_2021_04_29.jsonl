Let\u2019s say I started with 50:50. As the market gets stretched (and  yeilds on my div stocks decline due to rising prices), I might sell off some stocks that I think are overvalued or have concerns about. This will stay in cash or bonds. For example, by Jan 2020 I was about 65-70% in bonds. I thought the market was a bit rich, but I had no idea about what was going to happen - I actually took out money to pay for some expenses.\n\nThen if there is a sell off (and there sure was in this case), I\u2019ll start to buy back some stocks (in a decline, this will partly be due to assignment on CSPs that I didn\u2019t roll). So in my case, by April 2020, I was only about 20% bonds. As the market has been moving up over the last year, the value of my stock position has been growing ans I\u2019ve sold some off lately. Back to close to 50:50 at this point.\n\nWith respect to fear of owning stock and a black swan - it you are not over leveraged and the stocks are of viable, profitable companies and not crap, it\u2019s your own behaviour that will sink you, not the market. A lot of people view stocks as prices of paper that get traded - this view  makes it hard to hold through bad times. Rather, view them as ownership of a business. If the business is viable and profitable, it will be fine and price will eventually come back to reflect future earnings.\n\nI start by identifying companies I want to own by doing real work in analysis. I then see if there is a price I would buy it at that would be an objectively good deal, and then write premium at that price. If the stock never drops to that level - too bad, I get premium (I usually sell well before expiration. If it does drop, I\u2019ll often try to roll down and out if I can get a credit, if not, I\u2019ll usually accept assignment.\n\nI set up the CSP to generate 5-10% (overbought markets) to 20-30% (very oversold markets) on an annualized basis. As I usually close these early, the annualized rate is usually double that.\n\nIn my view it\u2019s critical to set it up so that the worst case scenario is survivable. So I calculate my notional maximum exposure on all short positions - it\u2019s $1M today for example. I ensure that cash+bonds+50% of stock value exceeds this, so I never get a margin call.\n\nObviously I have outlined a somewhat conservative game plan (for an options trading subreddit), but it works for me. You could say I can do this because I have a large portfolio - it\u2019s true, if you are trying to hit a specific dollar amount each period, it\u2019s easier with a large account. But I think it\u2019s a mistake to take on more risk just because you have an arbitrary $ goal and a small account - you are just increasing your chance of a fatal blowup.

No one in the market is stupid, and most of them have better information and more experience that you. So what advantages can you bring?", "score": 3, "replies": [{"body": "If you can't answer this, you should probably hold off on trading. For me, with this strategy, I think I have 2 sources of edge:\n\n1) The biggest edge is behavioural. I am actually willing to own the underlying, often permanently. This dramatically changes my risk profile and my stress when my short strikes are at risk. A lot of people say they only write on stocks they are ok to hold, but there's tons of examples here that that isn't so. So to be willing to own a stock, I have to believe in the company's financial viability. This is where the valuation and analysis work occurs. I then look at the strike at which I would be happy owning if assigned. For example, a recent trade for me (not a recommendation) is CAH. I like the business from the POV of DCF going forward. at the time of the trade it was selling at $47.65 and had a yield of 4.1%. In my view, I'd be happy to own this at 45 or 42.50, so I sold 60-90DTE puts at those prices. The stock moved up, so I have BTC many of those puts. If I had held to expiry, the annualized return would have been around 10%, but even though I closed at less than max profit, because I held for such a short time, the annualized return was around 20-25%.\n\n2) The 2nd source of edge is from selling rather than buying. Over long periods of time, IV over estimates RV. so if you allow the law of large numbers to play out (by making many small trades) you will capture this volatility premium, assuming your trading costs and execution errors don't eat it. You can improve this edge slightly by choosing underlyings where the IV is expensive compared to historic norms (or strikes where the IV is expensive compared to other strikes) . When choosing a stock to write on, if I have a few to choose from, I will look for one that seems to have higher than typical volatility compared to it's vol history (obviously, you want to make sure the reason for this vol isn't something that would turn you off the stock permanently). On a general basis, the vol premium seems to start to shrink beyond -0.2 delta, so I will usually stick to around -0.1 to -0.2 (not a strict rule).\n\nThe question you need to answer is why someone would be willing give you that vol premium. If you can answer that, you are a long way towards actually understanding how to use this safely.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5290704369544983}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.6299102902412415}, {"body": "Another resource that is worth looking at is Predicting Alpha - it\u2019s a data and education site.
