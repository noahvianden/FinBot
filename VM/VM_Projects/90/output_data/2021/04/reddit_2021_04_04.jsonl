Monopoly just isn't really good for Google anymore and is more of a liability. \n\nMost probably the company will go through a prolonged stagnation like Microsoft did in the early 2000s when it faced similar antitrust challenges. Google won't be able to aquire competition like it did before and won't be able to leverage its strong positions as much as it used to.\n\nGoogle Cloud is running way behind AWS and Azure and provides notoriously poor support. Companies today by default go to AWS, but because Amazon directly competes with so many companies, a lot of them choose Azure instead and get other Microsoft services as a bundle. Google Cloud is lagging behind and losing billions and billions trying to catch up.\n\nGoogle's moonshots never paid off. Their \"X\" division lost billions and never materialized any products. Like Microsoft in the 90s and 2000s, Google invested into great ideas too early, wasted a lot of money and couldn't make viable products out of those investments. For example, Google has been investing into self-driving tech for 12 years now, no automaker is using their tech, and competitors are on the same tech level even though they started much later.\n\nMany products that Google releases show signs of poor management, internal disorder and lack of vision. Google Stadia and Google Pay are perfect examples of that, as well as endless list of short lived chat apps.\n\nOverall, in the past decade Google did not produce any new impactful products like it used to. All their cash cows are coming from the 00s. Google Search, Ads, Maps, Docs, Android, YouTube, Gmail, Chrome - are all from that time. The company scaled and improved them really well, but hence the antitrust issues.\n\nGoogle is not very good at actually competing. It either has 80-90% market share or nothing. Everything in-between gets cancelled.\n\nMost of the revenue growth comes from the internet itself growing and ads moving online, but that is slowing down and there's not much else Google is good at.
