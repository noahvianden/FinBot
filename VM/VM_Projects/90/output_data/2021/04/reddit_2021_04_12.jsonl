He says the fed can not exactly pinpoint where asset bubbles are, then states that they ensure that if there were bubbles the market wouldnt take such a heavy hit .\n\nJpowell was asked about will there be a crash like the 2008 one. He responded by saying \"Fuck no\"(I wish did, but he just said , banks werent stupid and that the chances of that are extremely low to nonexistent)\n\nJpwoell said his policies are tp keep the economy in warm enough place to where jobs can be created but not hot enough for runaway inflation.\n\nJpowell says he is ready to see real inflation, if it is consistent at 2% or over he will act.\n\nFinally he said it folks, he does not see him doing anything to increase the rates this year .\n\nTLDR- I hear a bull run coming and it sounds like its about rip.
