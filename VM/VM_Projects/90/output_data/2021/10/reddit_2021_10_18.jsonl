{"title": "PLAN FOR CHRISTMAS DISASTER AND BUY THE GAME DEVELOPERS", "selftext": "Here is an easy layup, I think we can get ahead of the news here. \n\n(THEORY)\n\nYou've heard about the looming disaster of a Christmas shortage we will potentially have. Severe supply chain issues, Ports blocked, trucking and transport shortages, rising material costs and inflation have prices soaring, presents for little spoiled shit heads across America may be in very little supply or even non-existent during the holiday shopping season. \n\nWell, Momma is not going to allow little Timmy to go without presents on Christmas morning, so what does she do? For Christmas she's going to let Timmy take that card and rack up more VC, Fortnite Bucks, and COD Coin than any quarter during the pandemic. (sorry, don't know the proper in game purchasing tokens for each game). TBH, most kids probably prefer the in game purchases as presents vs physical toys now. Weird I know, but I've seen kids get more excited about an NBA2k VC gift card than actual tickets to an NBA game. So a massive amount of in game purchasing is about to happen for these game developers, because they are not constrained by supply chain/inflation issues, they stand to gain more than anyone this shopping season. \n\n(TIMING)\n\nI see the start of the Christmas shortage talks happening shortly after Halloween and then not long after that the realization of gaming companies being the only ones to guarantee Christmas gifts. Once we start getting into holiday season and the shortages actually do start to become more prevalent and talked about the sentiment will be the same as pandemic times. \"Kids are stuck at home without any physical presents and gaming industry looks to profit the most.\" This will initiate another massive run up to each of their ATH's leading up to Christmas.. \ud83c\udf81  This is a perfect scenario for gaming developers, low competition, massive demand coming, production can meet demand.  The share price run up to ATH may last after Christmas, but Im betting it comes even before the more and more Christmas shortages are talked about.\n\n(RISK)\n\nNo Christmas shortages happen and everything is absolutely fine. Which we know is not happening, we can all feel that. But if it were the case, your downside is limited since this hasn't been priced in at all and naturally they will still have a run up into holiday season. \n\nAnother factor is that any potential Fed talks that shake up the entire market, at which point any of your long positions in tech would be getting hammered anyways. \n\nThe Risk/Reward in the short term market seems to be the greatest here. \n\n(POSITIONS)\n\nI am going long all the underlying RBLX (400 shares, 31% move back to ATH) TTWO (400 shares, 25% move back to ATH) EA (300 shares, 10% move back to ATH) ATVI (500 shares, 33% move back to ATH) \n\nWill be buying call spreads around the ATH's for each running into Christmas shopping season on the down days (with hesitation on ATVI calls due to headwinds from internal legal factors that bring unpredictable risks).", "id": "qamr6k", "created_utc": 1634563891.0, "score": 281, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "Great idea, but I just looked under the couch pillows and I can't find 20k to put into those.", "score": 87, "replies": [{"body": "What a piece of shit, dumb couch.", "score": 69, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah everyone knows the dryer has all the money.", "score": 33, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.13202406466007233}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37762388586997986}, {"body": "Lmao, premiums a little high right now but only going to get higher.
