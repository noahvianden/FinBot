Anyone who thinks the Metaverse is vaporware, I agree this will be pretty bad for FB.\n\nI'm really failing to see the illogic of my comment, or how its dangerous. I didn't guarantee anything--just saying FB needs to move on and I can't think of a better direction they can go. What new direction do you think they can take at this point that is better with more profit for a company their size?\n\nEdit: My spelling is not great. And I enjoy the discussion.", "score": 4, "replies": [{"body": "Fully understand what you\u2019re saying and actually agree with you on most of your points, but from the side of someone who is not an investor of FB, but who would have been had this quarter looked different. A different perspective. \n\nFB is at the end of their ropes, but they never really put money to work towards innovation. The majority of their money went to data/algos/AI to help improve revenue on their platforms (via ads). And they did a really damn good job of that, at the cost of being extremely invasive towards end-user privacy. So much so that Europe as a whole shut down FBs revenue growth through GDPR in 2018. The writing was on the wall. Sure enough AAPL comes along and for whatever reason (heroics, vendetta, dick swinging) decides to fire the shot. \n\nNow, no matter how bullish you might be on the metaverse or whether or not they even pull it off, the question outstanding is where will the revenue growth to justify FBs future price come from in the next 3-5 years? \n\nIf you listened to the earnings call the only hint we got was from Sandberg who said that (1) they\u2019re hoping they can build some workarounds to some of AAPLs privacy safeguards and (2) they\u2019re going to work on showing advertisers how to properly value their ad dollars on FB. Both of those things should be terrifying to a shareholder. (1) So you\u2019re telling me you\u2019re looking for a way to invade my privacy again that isn\u2019t caught by AAPL and (2) You\u2019re telling me my balance sheet is wrong? Because I have historicals here along with a whole lot of data I got directly from you prior to all of this happening. \n\nRight now FB feels - to me - like it\u2019s moving to a speculative play. That\u2019s really bad. It means institutions might pull out. Which means months of volatility and pump and dump \u201cnews\u201d and \u201cFUD\u201d until they\u2019re all square and then FB is a free fall to some equilibrium point. It\u2019ll just be way lower than current price. \n\nThat\u2019s my take anyway. I should also note that I personally give zero shits about the whistleblower stuff. It\u2019s like telling me that the whore down the street was whoring. Totally immaterial aside from a talking point on some politician\u2019s next campaign run and the impotent outrage generation having new things to tweet, protest  and cry about.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "When I said \"end of the rope\", I meant more in terms of MAU. My broker has them down as 50% EPS growth in TTM, forward EPS next 5 years 21%,, ROE 30%, Rev. growth last 5 years 37% and rev. growth TTM of 42%. We can argue the forward-looking numbers of course. But for a company of their size, that's spectacular. Growth will slow, but not stop. That they are trading at 21x forward earnings (compared to say MSFT at 35% with lower estimated growth ahead), tells me the price has room to run just based on valuation.  \n\n\nThe AAPL privacy issue is a good point. It certainly caught SNAP off guard and their stock paid for it dearly. My take is FB is too clever to not find a workaround for tracking. But if they can't it will be an issue.\n\nNot sure what the reference to balance sheet is, but can we agree it's safe to say that are sitting on mounds of cash that is earnings next to nothing on return? My only point is they won't have to take on much extra debt, if any, to get this ball rolling, and their FCF is enough to sustain the project for a while (if the metaverse is mostly software they've got a lot of infrastructure already). But as you said, we don't know, so a lot of both our statements are speculative, which is all we have at this point. Maybe it ends up being a huge waste of capital. I'm betting against that.   \n\n\nI agree the name changes implies a more speculative feel to it. It seems to me that they are kind of forecasting too far out, trying to stir up a little excitement to get attention away from the bad press and regulation worries (agreed the whistleblower issue is overstated). I do think if the metaverse doesn't pan out, they will change directions rather than go down with the ship. Again, at such a low earnings multiple, they have some margin of safety to use.\n\nLastly, I have faith that their CEO is probably an android who doesn't sleep and will figure all this out. With a different leader, I would be more worried. I'm by no means a FB perma-bull, but all this name-change and pie-in-the-sky talk of metaverse doesn't have me overly concerned.
