Only his clients who pay him see his returns. \n\nPlenty others who does this for a living are transparent with their returns. Even Warren Buffett boldly posted his bet results buying $SPY at the peak of the market before the financial crisis crash, and how it performed 10 years later. Check Berkshire's shareholder's letter in 2017.\n\nRay Dalio is also pretty transparent with results of his bets. And that's the biggest hedge fund out there.\n\nBurry does not post his returns because he's more often wrong than right and that hurts his credibility, and he's also too insecure and does not want to be called out for being wrong. The due makes money once a decade. \n\nAnd did you forget that he has been calling for hyperinflation since Quantitative Easing phase 3 back in 2011? Did you not buy $SPY because your hero burry said  \"it was going to crash\" ? lmao... that's why you follow Buffett's advice, buy and forget. Instead you following some dude who makes money once a decade.\n\n>All we can do is guess based on his SEC filings and what he tells us.\n\nYa but It doesn't take rocket science to figure out the range of the stock price when he initiated his short position in tesla back in Dec 2020.
