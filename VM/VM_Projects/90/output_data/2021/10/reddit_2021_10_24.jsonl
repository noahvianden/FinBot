Omar's comments about rioting if they took autopilot away from us were incredibly childish, and I'm glad he deleted his tweet.  This was probably the worst thing I saw tweeted, but I'm not super active on twitter.  Many of Tesla's supporters rightfully pointed out a laundry list of conflicts of interest, and spread the word about her past language/involvement associated with TSLAQ.  The reality is that Tesla is a much bigger company now, and as Tesla gets bigger it will have a larger and larger target on its back with respect to regulatory scrutiny.  We are not the underdog anymore, and the world has already realized this. This has been obvious for many of us for quite a while, but it was a very fast transition for everyone else.  We as a community have to recognize that the tesla fan community will be held to higher standards from here on out.  I'm hoping someone more level headed (like Rob) can make some sort of inroads with the press to better explain specifically what our community is so upset about and cut through the bullshit trolling on twitter.\n\nThat being said, Ive read more than a few articles that have deliberately mischaracterized the controversy here. None of them made ANY mention to the multiple conflicts of interest, the personal attacks Missy made pointed towards Musk, or her use of the twitter TSLA block list and association with TSLAQ.  Instead, the narrative the media seems to be going with is that the \"Tesla Fanboys\" are targeting her because she is a minority (white woman) and has been critical of tesla in the past.  \n\nI guess all this is to say that the media (at least in the US) is completely broken, and there's almost no point in reading it anymore.
