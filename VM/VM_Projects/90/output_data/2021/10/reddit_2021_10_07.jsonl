I have been playing around with different strategies and want your input on it!\n\nFor the past 4 weeks I have been able to earn 8.4-9.5% weekly buying deep ITM call debit spreads on Tesla.\n\nEssentially the bet is that, on a weekly basis, Tesla will not lose over 11% Share Price Value from M-F.

During \"quiet\" times, I'll use as little as 20% of my total margin, but during \"tense\" times, you can jump in and short implied vol. my rough guidelines are: 50% of margin at 120VVIX, and all-in at 140 VVIX\n\nNormally, a 15% strike will be at maybe 80-90vol, like the 29 strike is today. However, during a spike, if the VXX hits 30, for example, that call will be at like 130 vol. So if you short at the top, you'll make money on the delta and the vega (or theta)\n\nYou can hedge your bets a bit by also selling a downside put. The beauty is they'll be at really high vol too, so you won't lose much even if the underlyer drops. for example, if we had that spike up to 30, a 26put might be at 80vol, but when the VXX relaxes down to 27, that same strike might relax from 80 vol down to 60vol like it is right now. So you'll be hurt on the delta, but compensate on the vega.\n\nnow how do you \"sell at the top\"? That's just me getting lucky, I guess.

VXX goes up like 10 - 30%\n\n2. the temper tantrum doesn't get too bad, as in it doesn't blast past you and spike up to +50% or more\n\n3. the dip relaxes, then you de-lever and wait for the next spike.\n\nAnd that exact thing has been happening all year:\n\n1.
