{"title": "The story of Corsair $CRSR", "selftext": ">\u201c\u00a0I bought every V12 engine. Wish I could take it back to the beginnin' I coulda bought a place in Dumbo before it was Dumbo For like 2 million That same building today is worth 25 million Guess how I'm feelin'? Dumbo\u201d, Jay-Z - The story of OJ\n\nI really believe one of the best pieces of personal finance and investing that was ever written is Jay Z\u2019s \u201cthe story of OJ\u201d (sorry Warren, sorry Ben Graham). Please go ahead and listen\u2026[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM7lw0Ovzq0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM7lw0Ovzq0)\n\nIt will help us better understand the gigantic opportunity that **Corsair Gaming ($CRSR)** is.\u00a0**It really is Dumbo before it was Dumbo!**Bear with me as you will have to understand concepts such as compounding and patience... Apologies in advance if I\u2019m not using any rockets.\n\nI\u2019m not gonna bore you too much with what Corsair does.\u00a0I think enough has been written about it\u2026 Suffice to say they are market leaders in a market, that of PC gaming components and systems & gamer and creator peripherals, that is becoming more and more mainstream.Just few days ago, **Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that gaming could become the entertainment industry's largest category.** So much for Corsair being just a niche company...\n\n[From Latest Form 10-K](https://preview.redd.it/xwnxex78l2t71.png?width=1564&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bf58a99be009a4dca2deb5b62ba4e52bad335ac)\n\nThey have created a brand that stands for quality and they are in the early innings of creating a very sticky ecosystem that also involves software, specifically icue.Listening to recent earning calls you\u2019ll hear that they are focusing future acquisition dollars on software companies.\n\n>\"I would say, if I look across all the companies we're talking to, and -- and that's quite a few, most of them are revolving around software and services either to do gaming or streaming\". Andy Paul - CEO, Q4 2020 earnings call\n\nThey know what they are doing and they know that software is instrumental in developing an even better ecosystem and that building recurring revenue is crucial in the strengthening of the moat they already possess.\n\n**Finally getting to the DD\u2026**\n\n**1. The case for a Short Squeeze (this is a long term play, but that does not mean that a small or large squeeze cannot happen)**I want to start by focusing on debunking some of the things that have been said in the past.One of the things you hear over and over, pretty much in every single comment section, is that Corsair is a great company but a terrible stock because eagle tree is stopping any potential momentum by selling any time the company hits $35.Now\u2026 one first clarification: from $26 to $35 is close to a 40% upside!!! How\u2019s that bad you\u2019ll have to explain!?\u2026\n\nAnyway...I\u2019m just gonna assume that people are unexcited about this because they are used to short squeezes and anything below a 2x in a few days is not worthy of their attention. Hence, since they feel that the short squeeze is impossible, the stock is uninteresting.\n\nWhile I believe this is wrong on so many levels (a stock represent ownership in a business and if you are buying cheap you\u2019ll make great money whether the stock squeezes or not), I actually do think there is a case for a potential squeeze to happen.\n\n**According to Yahoo Finance, short interest is 38% as of September 29th**, which makes it one of the most shorted (definitely top 20) stocks in the market (I'm digressing here, but I do want to say that while I appreciate different opinions, is there really nothing better to short than  this??? A company with real profits in a booming market?? I'll talk about some of the (temporary) potentially bearish matters later).\n\nNow, while I definitely don't see this as a short squeeze play (but a long term play), **one cannot ignore that it's not like Eagle Tree can actually sell whenever it wants. They are an insider in the company and as such they have to follow very specific rules\u2026**\n\nCurrently for example **Corsair is in its quiet period** until when it will publishes Q3 results (in the first half of November) so **insiders cannot actively buy or sell the stock!**\n\n[EagleTree Capital Trades](https://preview.redd.it/kq0udu4a03t71.png?width=1309&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b82c659323ed98bc72f589850f8a9073199dba7)\n\nYou'll notice (picture above) how EagleTree last sold on June 15th (with some transactions starting on June 3rd). This is likely the last day it could have sold before the beginning of the quiet period (when the results of the quarter become too clear to insiders - around 2 weeks before the end of the quarter).The smart ones will notice that the previous time Eagle Tree sold was on January 26th, in theory during a quiet period as Q4 was over and they hadn't yet announced the results to the public (the Q4 results were announced on February 9th). **But** that sale was part of a public offering (where they simply sold insiders shares - no new shares were issued hence there was no dilution for shareholders) and they had to update the market on up to date financial information. Indeed, you will see that in the offering documentation, they gave data they hadn't given before, specifically the registration statement [https://ir.corsair.com/node/7141/html](https://ir.corsair.com/node/7141/html) showed preliminary financial results at page 9:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pse82klks2t71.png?width=1669&format=png&auto=webp&s=44dc9c90d670938802a3dbf6923737899e1bda50\n\nAgain, this was new information at the time! These were numbers that updated those already available to the market prior to that release. That's actually what allowed insiders to sell.\n\nAll this to say, **don't expect any insider sales before earning release** (unless they do an offering like the one they did in January but that takes a long time to organize).. **This leaves a cool month at least where a squeeze could actually happen even beyond the well known $35 barrier that seems to be the minimum price at which Eagle Tree sells.**\n\n**2. Why Eagle Tree selling can actually become a positive for the stock**\n\nLet's now discuss briefly about EagleTree. Yes, they are a private equity company and they will therefore have to eventually sell their position and return their fund. Nothing new.What should be said more often is that, as soon as they sell out, the stock will have a much larger float, therefore becoming very interesting for larger funds and those passive investing vehicles (e.g. ETFs, funds) that cannot invest too much until the float increases in size. Liquidity is in fact a very important criteria for ETFs allocation in a specific security (which if you think about it creates very stupid dislocations but I am digressing - for example a company is less appealing when highly owned by insiders - if they sell and sometimes they will sell because the company is overvalued, then all of a sudden the stock is more appealing to passive vehicles... as mentioned, I am just digressing here, but it's always entertaining how certain market dynamics create opportunities).\n\n**3. Truly impeccable capital allocation**\n\nManagement has been engaging in value accretive M&A with the acquisitions of Elgato, Scuf and Origin PC, among others.Recently they have directed the excess dollars to debt repayment, which was also instrumental to the recently announced debt refinancing which will save the company around $10M per year in interest payments. Their new debt conditions are incredibly good (as per the press release [https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-announces-new-350-million-credit-facility](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-announces-new-350-million-credit-facility), \"the rate for a LIBOR borrowing under the new term loan is LIBOR plus 1.25%, compared to the retired term loan which carried a combined interest rate of 4.75% for a LIBOR borrowing, made up of LIBOR, with a 1.00% floor, plus a margin of 3.75%.\"Having good credit really matters and, together with their large Free Cash Flow, will allow them to grow in the future without diluting shareholders.\n\n>\"You wanna know what's more important than throwin' away money at a strip club? CreditYou ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America?This how they did it\"  Jay-Z - The story of OJ\n\nCapital allocation is crucial for long term compounding of wealth. Rarely have I seen a company buying so well and doing what's best for shareholders (high inside ownership does help).\n\nAs mentioned, the CEO did say the next acquisitions are likely to be software acquisitions, which is in my opinion a real positive and they give me even more confidence in management.\n\n**4. Bottom of a cycle??**\n\nLet's now talk about some of the reasons why short sellers have been targeting Corsair.One of the most prevailing arguments is that Corsair has benefited greatly from Covid and these benefits are about to end. So basically the hardware cycle is over and revenues and profits will diminish.First of all, one should also look at where the company is trading now...It's trading at **16.5 times 2020 earnings and around 14 times 2021 earnings**, well below the market and especially below the average for growth companies (which are often trading at crazy multiples of revenues as they don't have any profit whatsoever).\n\nBut is the hardware cycle really at its peak?Let me quote the CEO in a recent earnings call:\n\n>\"So look, in terms of gamers and consumers, we've got the benefit now of having quite a few research reports done by the usual suspects, so Newzoo, JPR, etc. I think what we're seeing is that although the gamers continue to increase, now the numbers are getting around 3 billion gamers in the world. The more important number for us, firstly, those people that are actually paying money of any sort at all for games or hardware.  \n>  \n>And specifically for us, how many people are playing games at a higher level, so that they start to buy gear. As you probably know, it's still a small fraction of the people who are playing games who are buying specialized gaming gear. So we're nowhere near any kind of saturation, in fact quite the opposite. The vast majority of people that are playing video games have bought no specialist gaming gear at all.  \n>  \n>So we still have a very untapped market and that's really what we've seen now looking over our shoulder over the last 12 months. It's less of a factor that more gamers are coming to the market, more factor that the gamers that exist are playing more and starting to buy more gear. Now the most encouraging part of that is the number of people in the PC gaming sector that have actually stepped up to buy or build gaming PCs because my notion is, if you're buying a $2,000-plus gaming PC now, you're planning to play a lot of games, not just in the next few months, but well into after COVID, shelter home stops. So that's the most encouraging thing we've seen.  \n>  \n>And we had record sales in Q1 for all of our prebuilt gaming systems, ORIGIN origin and Corsair. And we have very, very healthy growth in our components business, and that's directly tied to -- certainly to the products we make, it's truly tied to people building $2,000-plus gaming PCs. So that's a very different dynamic than somebody -- the parent buying a pair of $50 headsets for their kids because they're home. So I do think we're seeing a continued long-term growth as people get more and more into gaming and -- especially the PC gaming sector and decide to buy specialist gear, either maybe move from playing on laptop to dedicated high-performance gaming PC.\" - Andy Paul, 2021 Q1 Earnings call\n\nIn my opinion, the best parallel to understand Corsair is Nike when running was less of a mainstream thing. Originally only used by athletes and more serious runners, it became mainstream as pretty much any individual with an interest in fitness became interested in running. I see huge parallels with the brand Corsair is building (Go and test out if curiosity what people say in specialized shops - they'll show you a competitor saying \"if you want the cheaper low quality option, go for this... if you want real quality, just go for Corsair and you will be set\").\n\nI honestly think shorts are been very very lazy... again, are you telling me that there aren't any much more obvious shorts in the market? Are you really picking a very profitable company, with strong leadership in a rapidly growing industry and deciding that it's worth shorting it, risking infinite losses?\n\n**5. Shortages and increased shipping costs**\n\nWill this have an impact on SHORT TERM margins? Very very very likely! I\u2019d say almost certain!The funny thing is that the same people that sometime profess the importance of looking at the long term are shorting the stock as an \u201cobvious short\u201d for these very temporary reasons.The reduced margins will only have a very short term impact on profitability, if at all. The company will generate growing free cash flows for many years to come! That's the only thing that matters!\n\n**6. Margin of safety**\n\nOne of the most important concept in investing is that of \u201cmargin of safety\u201d - when downside is limited and upside is gigantic, you are faced with an asymmetric opportunity, the classic: **head I win, tail I don\u2019t lose much**.\n\nWhat's the worst that can happen? It doesn\u2019t take a genius to understand that gaming will be more and more prevalent and that Corsair has a consolidated leadership in an important niche within the industry. At worst, you'll be forced to own for a while a company with significant future prospects and you'll pay very little for it. At best, you'll have time the bottom perfectly, you'll enjoy a squeeze and you'll own a long term compounding machine with multibagger potential.\n\nSure, you might have to be patient to see a 10x, but patience is the key for long term investment success. And the good news is that you are likely to hit a 2x much more rapidly that the market will!\n\n**TLDR:** You can buy a great company at a very fair price. It's got typical elements of 100 baggers: it's managed by its founder, showing impressive capital allocation skills, in a growing industry, with a brand that is recognized as quality, with excellent customer service and capacity to innovate. It's also small enough at $2.4bn valuation to have significant room for market cap growth, especially when it's trading at such low multiples of earnings.\n\n>\"I bought some artwork for one millionTwo years later, that shit worth two millionFew years later, that shit worth eight millionI can't wait to give this shit to my children\" - Jay-Z, The story of OJ\n\nThat's how you should think about Corsair.\n\n**Position:** 17,100 shares across my three separate accounts\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7fbmpvv7oat71.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8a175a8edbb4f4ec1e4f6b6236398e138f42b43e\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gscuz1v7oat71.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d043dafa610a276648d97d7db1903b1412eeb726\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/es8p8nu7oat71.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f05f5dc1170c7d516bf92f68778b444448349a31", "id": "q7flwj", "created_utc": 1634144555.0, "score": 314, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "I like how I can time when I need to get ready to leave for work with the daily CRSR post.", "score": 92, "replies": [{"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|4886) stonk goes up?
