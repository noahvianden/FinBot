{"title": "Cathie Wood disputes Jack Dorsey\u2019s hyperinflation warning, says prices will fall after holidays", "selftext": "Innovation investor Cathie Wood on Monday rebutted Twitter and Square founder Jack Dorsey\u2019s theory on hyperinflation.\n\nThe founder and CEO of Ark Invest took to Twitter to expound upon her contrarian theory about deflation after Dorsey tweeted Friday evening that \u201cHyperinflation is going to change everything. It\u2019s happening.\u201d Wood estimates that her hypothesis will start to play out sometime after the holidays.\n\n\u201cIn 2008-09, when the Fed started quantitative easing, I thought that inflation would take off. I was wrong. Instead, velocity - the rate at which money turns over per year - declined, taking away its inflationary sting. Velocity still is falling,\u201d Wood said in a tweet.\n\n\u201cWhen costs and prices decline, velocity and disinflation - if not deflation - follow. If consumers and businesses believe that prices will fall in the future, they will wait to buy buy goods and services, pushing the velocity of money down,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cNow we believe that three sources of deflation will overcome the supply chain-induced inflation that is wreaking havoc on the global economy. Two sources are secular, or long term, and one is cyclical. Technologically enabled innovation is deflationary and the most potent source,\u201d Wood said in the Twitter thread.\n\n\u201cAs a result, once the holiday season passes and companies face excess supplies, prices should unwind. Some commodity prices - lumber and iron ore - already have dropped 50%, China\u2019s crackdowns are one of the reasons. The oil price is an outlier and psychologically important,\u201d Wood said.\n\n[Link via CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/cathie-wood-disputes-jack-dorseys-hyperinflation-warning-says-prices-will-fall-after-holidays.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.)", "id": "qgdzi5", "created_utc": 1635276079.0, "score": 115, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "Despite your feeling on Cathie Wood and Jack Dorsey if I had to throw down a dollar on who would be right or wrong in this situation I would go with Cathie.\n\nCathie is an economist and has worked under some of the best economists in the United States.

Otherwise they would go into STEM. In other words, economists are very bad inherently at what they do. Proof is in the pudding. Look at the history of the fed. Always a day late and a dollar short with their actions.\n\nJack actually has some STEM education. That is far more advanced than anything you get even at the phd level in econ or business. I taught the harder math courses in business at the masters level... its about the same as freshman level calc for any STEM major. So in terms of raw mental horsepower, the two arent even in the same league. Cathy might as well be a talking jelly bean. \n\nThats not to say she is wrong nor that Jack is some sort of genius and is always right (he obviously isnt). But if you are picking odds based who can solve a multivariable (complex) math problem, you dont pick an economist (lol). You pick someone with a science background or prepare yourself for a lot of pain.", "score": -6, "replies": [{"body": "This is a very good counterpoint, however, Dorsey didn't explain his rational and instead just stated the worst possible monetary event in the history will happen again. That, contrary to your point, is not what I would assume a mental horsepower prowess to seem like. Usually i've seen that the smarter people are, the less extreme and confident stances they take, especially without an explanation. The biggest economy the world has ever seen and quite a healthy one is 180 from a war torn nation, while absolutely crushed, being forced to pay huge reparations to other nations.\n\nSo to give a rebuttal your very good point - what if, in this case, some actual economic background is overpowering the average expected mental horsepower advantage due to education on Cathy's part and Dorsey's Dunning Kruger on the other part. 'Smart' people get overconfident just as easily as anyone else, and that breeds ignorance. \n\nI agree with the overall predicament, but in this case it seems youre overglorifying raw mental potential and not adjusting to the situation at hand, being Dorsey saying something completely extreme with no evidence or rationale, meanwhile Cathy with actual education on the topic giving her more neutral standpoint with reasoning.\n\nOn the other hand, you're also just making complete wrong assertions on people 'going to economy because they suck at maths'. Im a math guy and Im way more interested in economy due to its scalable potential of income from markets, which is like 2 orders of magnitude better effort-to-reward for sure. You seem like   You go to STEM and feel a sense of superiority from that.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Come on man... I was a professor. If you are great with math you go into math and still learn, apply or even work in econ if you like. There are little limitations to a STEM degree. You can do anything. Though I had some bright business students, the average business person was a stark difference from the average STEM student intellectually. This is a subject for another day.\n\nAgain not saying Jack is right but I do think its a huge risk and something we should be preparing for as a nation to insure we dont collapse a la USSR but that doesnt mean I think its 100% surely to happen. Then again if I were Jack, maybe I will make it sound that way to get people to think and react. Problem with people is if you say \"maybe\" then they wont care and go on their business. Nothing will change. But if I say you will lose your money and house, then suddenly they care and start to do things. I did that with students sometimes to light a fire under them (lol).\n\nBut if you want the truth, its too eary to tell if there is going be extended rapid inflation (hyperinflation). But I also think Cathy discounting it is doing so because she is an investment person so she has her bias. What bias does Jack have to fan the flames? As a business owner of a public stock, hyperinflation would make him richer. Its in his best interest to allow hyperinflation to happen. Same for Cathy or anyone with mountains of cash.\n\nSome of the signals are all there. Supply problems coupled with rapid real estate and stock inflation. The only thing missing is unemployment but that can change very quickly. If that happens crime skyrockets and things spiral very quickly. We are in real danger. The feds need to clamp down before it happens not after like they did in the 80s.\n\nDepending on the type of investor you are, if you want to outperform everyone else, what you want to do is prep for the worst. Cathy is obviously not doing that which is not good. Jack might be blowing out of proportion but at least he getting more people, like us, to talk about it.\n\nAs an aside, note that people with high intellect get tired of explaining things over and over. It gets old. Not saying Jack is like that but I can tell you that I get tired sometimes. Not that I hate people or anything, and I am far more patient than most. I was a natural teacher since childhood, but sometimes with strangers, I just give the short answer and walk. I do that here all the time. I start to react to a question, then just stop and erase it because I have already answered that question 100 times.\n\nAgain not endorsing Jack. But intellect matters a lot more than people think especially over time. The average person discounts it because most cant even define it or confuse it with wisdom which is not the same thing. Wisdom without intellect is why history repeats itself. Intellect without wisdom still makes mistakes but is far better because they will learn faster and adapt quicker. Over time they are better leaders. The former (wisdom without intellect) is highly unlikely to ever learn because the subject is over their head.\n\nI like to make analogies (sorry if this is an iffy one). I used to coach basketball. Cathy is like that kid who played their entire life and knows the game but is 5-8 and gets beaten regularly despite having the most experience. Jack is like the 6-6 guy who played other sports and has just started playing basketball recently. No matter how unfair it is, the person with the better physical tools is far more likely to be great at basketball even if they are younger and less experienced.\n\nThe nice thing about intellect however is its not genetic. Anyone can go learn the hard stuff with enough effort. Just pick up books on the core 4 STEM subjects and finish the problems. Your intellect will climb a lot and you will see things in a different light. The question people need to ask, is why do business folks not do that? Answer is they tend to have a lazy brain. Thats not to say they are lazy physically, they most certainly are not but you will not find many who enjoy mental challenges. I have a chess analogy for this but I digress. This post is already too long.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "1) Dorsey is big on cryptocurrency and he also got a lot of social media attention from that tweet. \"As a business owner of a public stock, hyperinflation would make him richer.\" Is nothing next to those.\n\n2) Again, hyperinflation is absolutely out of the scenario and saying hyper is already saying he/you/anyone doesnt know what theyre talking about. Ability to raise interest rates means they can halt run-away inflation in a heartbeat. So no, hyperinflation can't happen. Hyperinflation is negotiating a price for a meal after the meal at a restaurant, because the currency has already weakened by that time. Hyperinflation is using currency as wall covering. Hyperinflation is bringing a cartful of currency to buy groceries. U.S is never going to see hyperinflation. If Dorsey says that, he is just demonstrating ignorance and your point to believe him more because of STEM background is, I would believe, just tunnel visioning. Intelligence doesn't avoid ignorance.\n\n5% inflation isnt hyperinflation\n10% inflation isnt hyperinflation\n20% inflation isnt hyperinflation\n\n\n3) I totally understand giving the short answer and walking away. With all due respect, hyperinflation is not realistic and I think Dorsey is a looney for even using that word unironically. Hyperinflation has happened for a few times in history and never in such healthy economic conditions, with so many tools as now to manipulate everything. Supply of real currency hasnt even increased, you probably know. FED just buys bonds.\n\n\n4) \"Wisdom without intellect is why history repeats itself. Intellect without wisdom still makes mistakes but is far better\". Yes - And my original argument was that in this case wisdom of Cathy should hold more merit than Dorseys intellect without specific wisdom. And that your bias in favor of intellect is making you support an outrageous claim due to it being made by an 'intellectual'.\n\n5) \"I like to make analogies (sorry if this is an iffy one). I used to coach basketball. Cathy is like that kid who played their entire life and knows the game but is 5-8 and gets beaten regularly despite having the most experience. Jack is like the 6-6 guy who played other sports and has just started playing basketball recently. No matter how unfair it is, the person with the better physical tools is far more likely to be great at basketball even if they are younger and less experienced.\"\n\nAgain, I think your analogy is too biased towards Dorsey and against Cathy. Im not aware of eithers' background, but i bet Cathy had to have significant cognitive abilities to reach where she has reached. Cathy was laughed out of every place for years for calling Tesla undervalued by a huge margin. Market agrees with her now, more than agrees. That already shows intelligence, especially in light of majority opinion opposition. Now she is taking a stance again against majority opinion opposition. Like Burry famously did 15 years ago. So I would humbly ask you to consider your bias here, especially in regards to this extreme analogy (not that we arent all, but still.)\n\n\n6) \"The question people need to ask, is why do business folks not do that? Answer is they tend to have a lazy brain.\"\n\nI would argue that isnt true at all. Every brain is lazy. Brains just have effort exceptions in regards to interests and passions.\n\n\n7) \"The nice thing about intellect however is its not genetic. Anyone can go learn the hard stuff with enough effort.\" \n\nSo here it seems there's actually a hidden assumption that where Dorsey has reached, he hasnt had to put as much effort cuz of STEM intellect and Cathy, being a \"lazy brain\" business person, probably had to put a lot of effort with lower cognitive potential (vs Dorsey). Why wouldnt you assume opposite? What if Cathy reached her degrees and education with 20% effort and Dorsey had to study his ass off for 10 years with huge effort and drugs? I mean im saying I dont know and I wouldnt assume, but you seem to assume a definite predisposed advantage on Dorseys cognitive ability in earlier dialogue. \n\nIn middle school i always gave 0 effort on math, rarely showed up, never did any homework, slept during class, didnt even open my textbook during most sessions. I used almost all my free time on videogames. Now, I used to get most As with that effort in math, just listening to an hour a week to what my teacher was saying and finding the common sense faster than anyone else. Now My Jewish classmate got straight As in everything, but he was only allowed to study at home for his free time. He was overall a lot of a better student than I was, as you can surely assume work ethic and general academic success for both of us. Now how can you assume that he has a lot more mental prowess, though? My Jewish friend couldve gone to STEM easily too and started working on a social media app, I'd say, thanks mostly to his work ethic, not intelligence. This point im making is also kind of the point youre making in your last paragraphs, being that intelligence is learnable to an important degree, but the same point also goes against your first comment that started our dialogue.\n\nI would like to redirect you to the outright extreme negative assumptions you made about economists at the beginning - \"Uh people go into economics because they suck at math.\" and \"Economists are inherently very bad at what they do\" (because they have to suck at math).\n\nCool conversation, though.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "1 - Maybe but I am not really sold that he cares. At a certain point, unless you are profit from fame, it becomes moot. Dorsey is not running for office nor are his fortunes tied to people liking him. But anything is possible. I dont know the man.\n\n2 - The thing is, its happened before. So its not like a fantasy scenario. I agree we arent there yet but I have seen how fast things can turn and I think we should be hedging that possibility even if it doesnt happen. Kind of a plan for the worst and hope for the best stance. On a governance level that should be the policy (side on the side of caution). On a corporate or personal level you can still do whatever you like.\n\nHyperinflation isnt an absolute number. The danger is the long time frame not the actual ending number. This is a huge problem for business at the ground level because it makes it impossible to adjust. So for example, 20% over 30 days isnt a problem because operationally we adjust and move on. But 1% a month for 12 months is a huge problem because you continuously try to adjust and just guesswork. Some will guess right and other wrong and in between some will fail hence volatility. Business hates volatility and most humans dont like it either and become fiscal conservative when it happens thus starting a snowball effect.\n\n3 - The feds are just people and highly politicized. During the 80s they were waaaaaay too late to act. They were reactionary instead of proactive which allowed the 80s problems to happen. It changed the political landscape, increased crime, and generally was a bad time except for the ultra rich who made off like bandits. Right now the fed chair is some dude with a fluff degree who has never worked a productive job in his life. He worked in banking and law... Im sure he is a nice guy but intellectually he is not reliable.\n\n4/5 - I am extremely biased towards intelligence. That is due to my own life experiences (seeing the results into my mid 40s) and my take on human history. One is anecdotal (obviously) while the other has some basis in reason but is still the way I see things. I have learned to trust myself. It has served me well in literally everything. Just wish I had trusted my self earlier in life instead of always questioning if that bias was real.\n\nSo for me personally, Id rather have a high schooler with high intellect and low wisdom run things than a senior with high wisdom and low intellect. Ultimately they both make mistakes but the former will adjust while the later is a box of chocolates. I absolutely dont trust the later in any way shape or form. They have let me down at every level from personal to national to international to historic to logical. Doesnt mean I think they are bad people or anything, and certainly I have many family and friends who are such and I would die for them. But they suck and I have told them this and they all know its true (lol).\n\n6 - Not true. I can tell you I am not like that nor are some people that I know. My brain is never off. Yes I can turn it off but it feels wrong and unnatural to me. I cant get any enjoyment in life when its off. Its sort of like those people who just cant sit down. I know some of those types too. For them, inactivity just feels wrong even though the body itself wants to conserve energy at a micro scale. On a macro scale, the person has learned that sitting is worse than moving. Same with some folks and their use of the brain. Also with the brain, using said thing doesnt really hinder body processes so there is really no biological reason for the brain to be lazy. The energy saved is very minor. Further, it goes against evolutionary advantages so I am not sold on the idea that the brain actually wants to be lazy. Body yes. Our entire design is based on that. Brain... dunno.\n\n7 - I obviously dont know those two so I am just playing the odds that smart folks are smart enough to go into STEM if they can for better life outlook. I am generalizing obviously but you know what? I have yet to encounter an exception. Can you name one? Name an economy educated individual who actually did anything innovative in the last say... 150 years... Its not going to happen. They dont exist. All the great innovators since the modern age of education were largely STEM educated either by the formal system or on their own. Not a single one has a \"economics\" or \"business\" degree despite business being the most prominent degree in modern history.\n\nAgain dont get me wrong. I dont think people are \"bad\" if they arent insanely intelligent. Not at all. All I am saying is economics are not good decision makers simply because they dont get much practice solving hard problems. Can there be exception? Sure. But if you asked me to side with 2 people I dont know like the two people of this discussion, ill take Dorsey given no other data.\n\nAlso I think that better grades doesnt mean intelligence. It depends. High school (and middle school) is just busy work. Do the busy work, and you get an A. It takes effort. However it doesnt mean you are smart. Not in the least. My sister was basically a valedictorian (she was screwed out of it on technicalities). Double majored in STEM and legal studies, got a masters, passed the CA bar her 1st try, became a lawyer, and is doing well now. On the other hand, I was like you, all I did was play video games and basketball. I even ignored eating (lol). And yet... You cant even compare us intellectually. She is smart, make no mistake, but we are totally different levels. I see things many steps ahead of her. It is what it is. So are you sure your friend is actually \"smarter?\" Maybe... maybe not.\n\nHere is another thing I learned over time. Depending on what video games you play at a certain age, Video Games can be far more intellectually challenging than things you see in classroom up until maybe pre-calc... Yep I am going to say it, Video Games can be a better mental exercise than school but it depends on what you play and how much effort you make.\n\nIf you are just playing action stuff that dont require thinking then sure. You will get nothing out of it except maybe better hand eye coordination (id argue the ones that make you run are actually better than PE). But if you were like me... all I played were RPG, strategy games and sports management games and the more complex they were, the more I liked I them. And when internet came along I played them competitively. Is there any doubt in your mind that something like competitive Starcraft is harder than, say, algebra? Its significantly harder on the brain... by a lot.\n\nNow college is a different ordeal. If you go into STEM in college is a totally different experience than going with a soft major especially here in the USA at major uni's. Other parts of the world, STEM is much easier (in general) but here in the USA, the level of challenge is on a completely different level. You can still get through with hard work but in many big colleges we have things called weeder classes. You cannot hard work your way through those. You either get it, or you fail and unlike soft majors there really is a right and wrong answer. Chemistry has this in O-Chem usually. Physics is usually electricity and magnetism if you do the calc approach. CS has stuff like algorithms and data structures where many fail. These dont really exist in soft majors.
