{"title": "Pfizer's Massive Upside Potential", "selftext": "Pfizer has a TON of upside potential. Here are a few different reasons why it could go to the moon.\n\n1. As of time of posting, only 50% of the US population is fully vaccinated (2 shots) against COVID and only 36.1% of the world population is fully vaccinated. (Source: [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)). Once Pfizer stops selling vaccine to the US, is it going to stop production? No, it will start selling to the rest of the world. Moderna just jumped 17% earlier this week when it was announced that they will start selling to Australia. We could see a 10-20% pop each times the news announce that Pfizer is selling to another country!\n2. There are still debaters out there so I'm not going to argue whether the vaccine works. The bigger point is that the government is paying for the vaccines and they believe the vaccine works. Therefore, US demand will literally be capped tits high until more of the US population is fully vaccination. Even once US demand dries up, the rest of the world will still be waiting for our extra supply for a long time.\n3. There are new variants. With the delta variant, Pfizer has already publicly said that a third booster will help. Imagine if the US gov announces they will start paying for 3rd vaccinations? What if an Epsilon or Zeta variant starts blowing up? Would they pay for a 4th or 5th vaccination?\n4. Gain comparison. Moderna has gained 253% since January 1st, 2021, even after the latest price correction. By contrast, Pfizer has only gained 31%.\n5. Solid Financials. During the last 2 earnings releases (where the effects of COVID vaccines have shown an impact), Pfizer outperformed EPS by \\~+20% and +10%. Due to the current trend with COVID, I expect this to go on at least for another year.\n6. This can be used as a hedge. If a new variant comes out and the S&P reacts adversely to it, at least Pfizer should be able to maintain value/go up because Pfizer/moderna/biontech would be most situated to come up with a response. \n\nEdit: The main concern seems to be that Pfizer is too big a company for COVID vaccination revenue to move the stock price. In Q2'21, Pfizer reported $19B of revenue, of which $7.8B came from COVID shots. By contrast, Moderna reported $4.4B of revenue. I would agree if COVID shots were only <10% of total revenue, but at \\~40% it's a different story. (source: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/covid-pfizer-pfe-earnings-q2-2021.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/covid-pfizer-pfe-earnings-q2-2021.html) and [https://www.pmlive.com/pharma\\_news/modernas\\_stellar\\_rise\\_continues\\_with\\_revenues\\_of\\_$4.4bn\\_in\\_q2\\_1374425](https://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/modernas_stellar_rise_continues_with_revenues_of_$4.4bn_in_q2_1374425))\n\nEdit 2: I've recently seen some concerning data that some of the comments brought up about the Pfizer vaccine having 40% efficacy vs the delta variant. This is based off a Mayo clinic study. There is also a separate New England Journal of Medicine study that showed Pfizer was 88% effective vs the delta variant. Both sources linked below.\n\nThe Mayo clinic study itself is pretty technical and hard to read, but I think the tables in the back are easier to understand for laymen like myself. In page 20, there is a table that shows the overall efficacy rates. On or after 14 days following the second dose, 7 out of 4,198,947 had COVID-19 associated ICU admissions. 0 out of 4,199,985 had COVID-19 associated deaths.\n\nTo me, this shows that the Pfizer vaccine indeed does do a ton to prevent serious illness and death. It may not be as effective at preventing someone from actually getting delta variant, but it would sure increase your chances of survival drastically if you did get it. A 4 million people sample size is definitely large enough to be statistically significant. I hate that a lot of times, news channels pick and choose statistics without showing the whole story in order to sell views. Mayo Clinic itself even states \u201cMayo Clinic is aware of media reports on the scientific preprint paper comparing vaccines\u2019 clinical effectiveness against the delta variant and breakthrough infections,\" a statement from Mayo Clinic says. \"We caution against drawing conclusions about vaccine effectiveness from a preprint study, which is intended only to be helpful to the scientific community and has not yet undergone the rigor of peer review.\u201d\n\nTo me, the jury is still out on the efficacy of Pfizer vs the delta variant, but it sure as hell seems to prevent death and/or serious illness.\n\nSources:\nMayo clinic: https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.06.21261707v1.full.pdf\nNew England Journal of Medicine: https://www.contagionlive.com/view/two-dose-covid-19-vaccines-remain-effective-versus-delta-variant", "id": "p3otnm", "created_utc": 1628872732.0, "score": 41, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|4|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/JASONLIU07, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "https://imgur.com/dn7Sbh5", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1429244428873062}, {"body": "This guy looks like a shill.

On or after 14 days following the second dose, 7 out of 4,198,947 had COVID-19 associated ICU admissions. 0 out of 4,199,985 had COVID-19 associated deaths.\n\nTo me, this shows that the Pfizer vaccine indeed does do a ton to prevent serious illness and death. It may not be as effective at preventing someone from actually getting delta variant, but it would sure increase your chances of survival drastically if you did get it. 4 million people samples size is definitely large enough to be statistically significant. I hate that a lot of times, news channels pick and choose statistics without showing the whole story in order to sell views. Mayo Clinic itself even states \u201cMayo Clinic is aware of media reports on the scientific preprint paper comparing vaccines\u2019 clinical effectiveness against the delta variant and breakthrough infections,\" a statement from Mayo Clinic says. \"We caution against drawing conclusions about vaccine effectiveness from a preprint study, which is intended only to be helpful to the scientific community and has not yet undergone the rigor of peer review.\u201d\n\nTo me, the jury is still out on the efficacy of Pfizer vs the delta variant, but it sure as hell seems to prevent death and/or serious illness.\n\nSources:Mayo clinic: [https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.06.21261707v1.full.pdf](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.06.21261707v1.full.pdf)New England Journal of Medicine: [https://www.contagionlive.com/view/two-dose-covid-19-vaccines-remain-effective-versus-delta-variant](https://www.contagionlive.com/view/two-dose-covid-19-vaccines-remain-effective-versus-delta-variant)", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Yeah data is data.

{"title": "Due Diligence Nokia (NOK)", "selftext": "\nI originally had a lot of links in this, but it led to the post getting auto-removed. Let me know if you would like any sources.\n\n# History of Nokia\n\nIf you've seen any of the recent Nokia posts over the last few months, a common comment you will see is: \"Nokia?!? That stock has been trading sideways for years!\"\n\nWhile yes that is true, it is important to understand why. Let's take a look.\n\n**2000-2013**\n\nNokia dominated the mobile phone market during this time due to a quality handset. NOK traded in the $50s during the Dotcom bubble and in $30s before the housing crash. However, they never recovered after 2008 due to struggling to keep up in software as the mobile phone market started to shift to smart phones.\n\n**2013-2019**\n\nWhen Nokia realized that trying to stay in the phone space was a losing battle they sold their phone division to Microsoft in 2013. For the next 3 years, Nokia was a large company in disarray.\n\nThis did not get much better in 2016 when they acquired Alcatel-Lucent and decided to focus on networks. The merger did not go as smoothly as planned and over the next 5 years Nokia started \"trading sideways\" due to a bearish sentiment.\n\nSome investors stuck around through all of this due to a dividend being paid out, but that was suspended in 2019 so Nokia could focus on developing its 5G mobile networks. This dropped the share price down to $3.50.\n\n**2020-Present**\n\nIn March 2020, sentiment started to change somewhat bullish as they announced Pekka Lundmark would be taking over as CEO. Pekka worked for Nokia for a decade in the 90s and most notably served as Fortum's, a Finnish state-owned energy company, CEO from 2015 to 2020.\n\nThe bullish sentiment was shorted lived due to the pandemic crash dropping the share price to $2.42. It started to pick back up over the summer when it was announced that Pekka would take over a month earlier than planned.\n\nThis was followed by rumors that there was a chance Nokia could win Verizon's $6 billion 5G deal. Hype around this brought Nokia's price above $5 for the first time since they suspended their dividend in October 2019. But in September, it was announced that Samsung won the Verizon deal and NOK fell down to $3.78. It fell even further to $3.37 in October when the rest of the market saw a down swing.\n\nThen it climbed back up to the low $4s, had a crazy January hitting $9.79 for about 10 seconds during to the meme stock frenzy, and has since returned to the high $3s low $4s after the Q4 earnings call.\n\n**Pekka's Tenure**\n\nPekka has been in charge for 11 months during a global pandemic, but he has been able to make some progress it appears. Much of this information can be found in the Nokia 2020 Annual Report.\n\n* He trimmed their employee size by 11,000.\n* He improved their free cash flow to $2.6 billion.\n* Even with the decrease in revenue he nearly doubled their operating profit (page 82).\n* He drastically reduced their net deferred tax balance (page 175).\n* He created four distinct business groups with plans for these groups to be shared in more detail during during Capital Markets Day on 3/18.\n* He replaced Nokia's CFO, CTO, and CMO (CFO happened before he took over)\n* It appears he issued new shares to leadership.\n* Pekka has a stake in the company (page 67 of annual report) with a long term goal to \"Focus on increase in share price and restoration of the dividend\".\n   * \" In addition, Mr. Lundmark received an award of EUR 1.3 million of restricted shares on joining to buy out the awards he forfeited on leaving his previous employer. Mr. Lundmark was invited to join the co-investment based long-term incentive arrangement (eLTI) targeted to engage senior leaders with the long-term nature of our business and share price, and purchased EUR 2.6 million of Nokia shares against which he was given a matching award of EUR 5.2 million of Nokia 2020 performance shares. This investment by Mr. Lundmark aligns him with\u00a0shareholders from the start and is a sign of his commitment and\u00a0engagement with the company. Delivery of actual Nokia shares would take place in 2023 subject to performance conditions\"\n\n# Bullish\n\nHere is a list of 28 deals and partnerships Nokia has established since December 2020. Some of these deals are not massive, but they span across 6 continents.\n\n**Largescale Network**\n\n* 5 year Multi Billion Dollar T Mobile Deal\n* 7 year Belgium deal\n* Deutsche Telekom in Germany\n* France's Mainland 5G Network\n* 5G Network in Austria\n* Telecom Italia\n* Cibicom ISP in Denmark\n* Polkomtel Phone Provider in Poland\n* Telenor Group in Thailand\n* Ooredoo in Algeria\n* 5G Network in Philippines\n* Tele2 in Sweden, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia\n* Ecuador\n* Vodafone in Australia\n* Saudi Arabia\n* Singapore\n\n**Private 5G Deals**\n\n* San Diego Gas &amp;amp; Electric Private Network\n* Port of Seattle\n* Japanese Companies Conexio, Hitachi Kokusai, Nippon Steel, Omron and Sharp\n* WEG Motor Manufacturer in Brazil\n* Elisa in Finland\n* Optus Stadium in Australia\n\n**Partnerships**\n\n* Google Cloud\n* EU's Hexa-X 6G Project\n* Brazil's Telecommunications R&amp;amp;D Center\n* AT&amp;amp;T tests to deploy virtualized and open RAN\n* Patents deal with Samsung\n* LG Uplus trial in South Korea\n*Bell Labs\n\n**5G is the Future**\n\nThe confusing nature of 5G could be holding back the market's valuation of Nokia. \n\n* Nokia is currently trading at a market cap of $22-23 billion even with a 2020 revenue of $24 billion.\n* A letter that Pekka recently published gives a decent explanation of what 5G is.\n   * In it, he admits \"\\[5G\\] is exciting, but it can seem a bit abstract.\" But then goes on to describe some real world examples that really helps explain it.\n   * \"Our partners saw unanticipated breakdowns and production line defects drop by 30% after installing smart video sensors in our manufacturing deployments. In the logistics sector, deploying augmented reality devices cut machine monitoring costs by half. In ports, remote-controlled cranes doubled productivity and eliminated staff injuries: an incredible 100% drop.\"\n* This seems to suggest that there may be more uses for 5G worldwide than cellular networks.\n* Nokia released a study stating that 5G could have an $8 trillion impact on global GDP by 2030.\n* Nokia and Ericcson may have a duopoly on 5G with Huawei and ZTE being banned in many countries. This trend may continue.\n* Some analysts have predicted massive (&amp;gt;1,000%) growth in the 5G market over the next 5 years.\n\n**Upcoming Events/Rumors**\n\n* **Capital Markets Day (3/18/21)**\n   * This is when we will get some true guidance on the future of the company. Not only will they lay out the strategic business plans for their 4 business segments as I mentioned above, but it should be when they make announcements toward potential a Dividend Reinstatement, Share Buyback, and future R&amp;amp;D decisions.\n* **Annual General Meeting (4/8/21)**\n   * Not sure what they plan to cover during this, but I would assume it will act as a follow up to Capital Markets Day\n* **Dividend Reinstatement**\n   * Most signs point to Nokia investing in R&amp;amp;D for a while, but based on Pekka's compensation package it should be back by 2023 at the latest.\n* **Share Buyback**\n   * Nokia did buy back 1.25 billion shares in 2015-16 and 1 billion shares in 2016-17. So the rumors they plan to do this again could be true. They can purchase up to a total of 550 million shares both this year and next year. 550 million because it correlates to 10% of the companies total outstanding shares.\n\n# Bearish (Risks/Cons)\n\n* The meme stock frenzy has a long-lasting impact on the opinion of this stock.\n* The dividend is not reinstated for another 3+ years.\n* Pekka does not have what it takes. Nokia is a sinking ship and cannot be turned around.\n* FCF is used solely for R&amp;amp;D and no shares are bought back over the next three years. The float does turn out to be too big to move significantly.\n* Nokia may not be undervalued and their revenue streams may continue to decline due to network share loses and pricing erosion.\n* Pekka has been very serious over the last two earning calls and things are going to get much worse/challenging before they get better.\n* With a new US administration in place, the trend of banning Huawei and ZTE that they started is lifted. These two competitors then undercut Nokia pricing.\n* 5G is no where near as big of an industry as the experts predict. Covid continues to slow the rollout of 5G well past 2030.\n* 5G is too confusing and never gets the buy in from today's investors.\n\nCowan Upgrades\n\nCowen Upgrades $NOK Citing Execution From New Ceo\n\nCowen adds its praise for\u00a0quarterly results, upgrading the stock to Outperform.\n\nFrom here, the demand environment looks to be \"very favorable,\" the firm says.\n\n\"What has changed is NOK's improving execution; we think upward trajectory is now clear and we expect meaningful incremental improvement from here, which while helping drive incremental revenue growth should especially help margin structure, and thereby EPS and cash flow,\" analyst Paul Silverstein says.\n\nMeanwhile, Silverstein says CEO Pekka Lundmark is following the playbook of Borje Ekholm's dramatic turn-around of Ericsson\u00a0(NASDAQ:ERIC); he's only one year in at Nokia and \"we think it is a safe assessment that further meaningful progress and attending upside lies ahead.\"\n\nCowen has raised its target on Nokia to $8 from $5, now implying 31.6% upside.\n\nCalls are also DIRT cheap, I think there is incredible growth over the long run AND the short term.\n\nI have 25 sept. 3 calls, 50 sept. 10 calls, 400 shares.", "id": "p3qlto", "created_utc": 1628877819.0, "score": 221, "upvote_ratio": 0.88, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|25|**First Seen In WSB**|6 months ago\n**Total Comments**|17|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|6 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n    \nHey /u/yiggyyaya, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "TLDR.

The equipment is NOT made overnight.  \n\nSo even if they broker a \"deal\" they will not deploy on it for years, after they migrate off the \"old\" Ericsson equipment. \n\nLast I heard we are bidding on swapping out flakey Nokia equipment fully from towers in the SE for Verizon to Ericsson. This is huge money for us, the equivalent of swapping out all the car parts in a car to make it go faster.\n\nIndustry experts will agree that Ericsson dominates the market, and again T-Mo uses it because they got a \"deal\" from Nokia.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "The United States only makes up 1/3 of the worlds 5G market.
