{"title": "Reality Check: Paysafe (PSFE) beats on revenue, reaffirms guidance, acquires three companies and drops 20% to 3.85X P/S", "selftext": "Today Paysafe, a fintech company offering digital wallets and integrated payment processing in 70 payment types in over 40 currencies across 120 countries, announced yet another acquisition, viafintech, to expand its global leadership position in open banking and eCash network. This comes on the heels of two other recent acquisitions. The new acquisitions combined with nearly 30 deals this year reflect Paysafe\u2019s rapid and systematic execution on their strategy to restructure and expand into new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nLast week, Paysafe beat Q2 revenue consensus, reported 41% volume growth and their first net profit as a publicly traded company. Initially upon the announcement, the stock shot up 10%.  But then pre-market headlines suddenly shifted and the stock gapped down and fell over 20%. Forward price to sales of 3.85X is extremely low for a fintech.\n\nWhy did the stock shift down so suddenly? Instead of acknowledging the revenue beat or other positive developments, financial headlines simply repeated : \u201cPaysafe Stock Sinks After Third-Quarter Guidance Miss.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, Paysafe didn't miss or downgrade its own guidance. In fact, they reaffirmed full year 2021 revenue guidance of over $1.5 billion.  They also said they anticipated full year volume to grow 30% above guidance. ($130-140 billion vs \\~ $105 billion)\n\nSo why the miss?  Analysts\u2019 modeling assumed that 2021\u2019s remaining quarterly revenue growth would be linear, quarter to quarter, rather than taking into account the fact that sports betting, like sports, are seasonal. In the CC, Paysafe said they expect to meet full year guidance but predicted Q3 growth would moderate due to sports seasonality and Europeans going on vacation.\n\nThe company beat estimates but growth isn't linear. Got it. Seems a bit of an overreaction for the stock to tumble 20% with short volume spiking to 50% and shares available to short suddenly dropping by 70%.\n\nGaps like that typically get filled if there\u2019s no material negative news.  On the contrary, Paysafe reported very positive news:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Paysafe reaffirmed FY21 revenue guidance of $1.53 - $1.55 billion\n* Reaffirmed FY gross profit guidance of $930-$970M and $480-$495M EBITDA\n* Beat revenue consensus, $384 million vs. $378 million\n* Met Q2 profit guidance and met positive EPS consensus.\n* 13% YoY revenue growth (nearly triple last quarter)\n* 23% YoY rev growth (excluding unwinding 2020 channel exits/divestiture)\n* 41% growth in total payment volume (TPV)\n* Revenue growth in all segments\n* eCash revenue +37% YoY  (now live on Microsoft Store/Xbox in 22 countries)\n* North Amercian iGaming revenue +48%; volume +72% YoY\n* Digital Wallet EBITDA grew 16% with a 48% margin (as they unwind channel exits)\n* Expecting 2021 volume to be $130-140 billion, up significantly from $105 billion guidance\n* Improved debt rating, improved debt terms and lowered costs\n* Several new US states and Canada open new multi-billion dollar iGaming market where they are already market leader with first-mover advantage.\n* Expecting Q4/2022 ramp up with strong pipeline growth in acquiring & E-commerce\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurther, Paysafe announced two new acquisitions: PagoEfectivo and SafetyPay. These deals bring their eCash business up to a million distribution points in 60 countries while connecting them with the majority of Latin American banks, and sets, \u201cPaysafe up to be the leading open banking and eCash solutions provider in Latin America, one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing online markets.\u201d  Importantly, this move also expands their market leadership in iGaming and critical groundwork in Latin America\u2019s fast growing iGaming market for key partners (Roblox, Draftkings, WynnBet, ESL Gaming, Microsoft/Xbox, BetMGM, Ceasar\u2019s, PointsBet, Penn, Twitch, bet365 etc.)\n\nWith their ongoing US expansion, these acquisitions also enable Paysafe to offer a more secure person to person payment platform for the $100 billion in remittances sent each year to Latin America.\n\nImportantly, these deals are expected to pay for themselves as Paysafe\u2019s current projections don\u2019t include their combined $60M revenue and $20M EBITDA, 55% CAGR, multiple cross-selling synergies, and the ability to scale up quickly at little cost.  Management noted, \u201cThese transactions are expected to be accretive to 2022 and further enhanced our long-term growth as we drive multiple cross-selling opportunities across all Paysafe business units\u2026The deal synergies and our growth profile will allow us to de-lever quickly and meaningfully make progress in 2022 towards our target of 3.5 times adjusted EBITDA.\u201d\n\nThis quoted debt/EBITDA ratio is better than most fintechs, including FOUR, RPAY, AFRM, BILL, PAYS and FISV.  Even before they reach that target, the new interest rate of 3.25% indicates that their pro forma free cash flow to debt service ratio will be around 4.5 to 1.\n\nChairman of the Board Bill Foley noted, \u201cWe see exciting synergies in key industry verticals like iGaming where we want to win. From the start, we have had a plan to grow in areas where we can achieve scale through operational efficiency. It is great to see the team execute and create more opportunities for growth.\u201d\n\nThese new acquisitions are perfectly in line with Foley\u2019s play book. He is known for inorganically growing many companies through M&A, as he did with FIS, growing it from $1 billion to $88 billion. \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYet financial news headlines ignored the positive developments and fixated almost exclusively on a Q3 miss resulting analysts\u2019 neglect to factor in predictable sports seasonality.  In fairness, there's no question management should have made this crystal clear to analysts in advance.  Still, the negative coverage fomenting 50% short volume was unwarranted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPaysafe vs PayPal\n\nSeemingly timed to help the short raid, an article tried to make the case that Paysafe was a bad investment compared to PayPal because PayPal is a \"free cash flow machine.\"  The author apparently didn\u2019t bother take into account that Paysafe actually generates proportionately more free cash flow than PayPal.\n\nIn fact, if you applied PayPal\u2019s EV/FCF ratio of 65x to Paysafe\u2019s 2020 $362 million in free cash flow,  Paysafe\u2019s share price would be $32.  A 4x gain from current levels.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nComparisons between Paysafe and PayPal are far from perfect but, since they are so common, here are a few more to consider:\n\n1. PayPal\u2019s Q2 ER also missed Q3 guidance AND was reported to be falling short on their 2021 full year guidance. (Paysafe reaffirmed all guidance.)  On top of that, PayPal missed on Q2 revenue consensus (Paysafe beat) and their Q2 EPS declined 22%YoY.  With all of that, headlines remained positive for PayPal and it went down only a third as much as Paysafe.  Keep in mind, PayPal came down from a lofty 15X price to sales on a real miss which is quite a contrast to Paysafe\u2019s dropping over 20% to 3.85X on primarily good news.\n2. Paysafe, a market leader in risk analytics, has spent much of 2020 strategically exiting the high risk \u201cbuy now/pay later\u201d business and riskier China market channels. They wisely did this just before China started cracking down on foreign payment processors. Meanwhile, PayPal has been entering both those same spaces.\n3. Due to the above divestiture and channel exits, Paysafe\u2019s growth has temporarily slowed. They reported 13% YoY growth but said, excluding those strategic moves, Q2 YoY growth would have been 23%, which may be a sign of growth to come. In Q2 PayPal reported 17% YoY growth.\n4. Between 2012 and 2020, Paysafe\u2019s revenue grew from $169 million to $1.43 billion (30.5% CAGR). During that same period, PayPal revenue grew $5.6 billion to $21.5 billion (17.8% CAGR).\n5. PayPal is currently much more profitable than Paysafe but, while PayPal\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 25% in 2022, Paysafe\u2019s EPS is expected to grow 425%.\n6. Based on Paysafe\u2019s $480 million EBITDA, PayPal\u2019s EV/EBITDA ratio of 47.2X would put Paysafe share price at $28.60\n7. Based on Paysafe\u2019s 2021E revenue of $1.53 billion, PayPal\u2019s Price to Sales ratio of 13.5X would put Paysafe\u2019s share price at $28.40.\n8. According to Reuters, in 2017, Paysafe was taken private for $4.7B (inclusive of debt) and is currently valued at under $8B (inclusive of debt).  During that time, including their 2020 revenue channel exits and divestiture, Paysafe grew revenue 18.2% CAGR.\n\n* By comparison, in that same time period, PayPal grew 17.8% CAGR.\n* Paysafe hasn\u2019t received much investor attention because it was private for the last 4 years so, while Paysafe\u2019s overall growth was somewhat higher, their market value is only up 75% higher in that the, versus PayPal\u2019s share value growth of 460%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere are obviously many different factors to consider so I\u2019m not making any claims about fair value here. It\u2019s simply interesting to note that all these comparisons (EV/FCF, P/S, EV/EBITDA, 4-8 yr growth) consistency put Paysafe\u2019s share price between $28 and $32.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Some Background:\n\nPaysafe is an extremely diversified global payment processor that is currently expanding into the US and Latin American markets. It is the #1 global leader in iGaming, the #2 digital wallet in the world, and is #4 globally in integrated merchant processing.\n\nAs an integrated back-end payment processor, most don\u2019t realize they are using Paysafe\u2019s gateway, whether by cash, debit, credit card or digital currencies.  Within the industry, Paysafe\u2019s proprietary scalable electronic payment platform was voted \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d, \u201cPayment Processor of the Year,\u201d and \u201cBest Payment Method.\u201d\n\nPaysafe is #2 globally in the digital wallet space with a presence in 120 countries. They own Neteller and Skrill, which was voted \u201cBest Digital Wallet\u201d for \u201cbest consumer take up\u201d, \u201cmost innovative technology\u201d with \u201cgreatest potential to disrupt current ecosystems.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot rates Paysafecard as \u201cExcellent\u201d (4.7/5 stars-31,981 reviews), Paysafe\u2019s digital wallet Skrill as \u201cgreat\u201d (4.1/5 stars-18,037 reviews) and Skrill Money Transfer as Excellent (4.8/5 stars - 8,349 reviews).\n\nBy contrast, Truspilot rates Stripe as \u201cAverage 3.4/5 stars- 6,208 reviews), Venmo as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 starts - 222 reveiews), Zelle as \u201cbad\u201d (1.2/5 stars - 326 reviews) and PayPal as \"bad\" (1.2/5 stars-18,555 reviews).\n\nThrough its eCash network, Paysafecard enables those without basic ID metrics, credit cards, or even bank accounts (the 1.7 billion \u201cunbanked\u201d globally) to engage in eCommerce in over 50 countries. This segment grew 63% YoY. Recently, Microsoft introduced Payesafecard to its Xbox platform in 22 countries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMOAT:\n\nPaysafe dominates in high growth verticals like iGaming and eCash/open banking because of its \u201crobust risk management.\u201d Their industry leading multi-jurisdictional regulatory expertise offers a durable advantage in spaces where competing fintechs are hesitant or unwilling to enter.\n\nCEO Philip McHugh from CC transcripts : \u201cWhen we talk about a deep and a wide MOAT, this is absolutely one of the areas that we see that benefit, where it\u2019s hard to copy.\u2026We have over 300 professionals dedicated to risk, compliance, and analytics. That is very, very rare in the payments space. It\u2019s a real strength of ours. We\u2019ve been able to track some of the top people in the industry, including the former CRO from PayPal, and we\u2019ve upgraded the team, we\u2019ve built some real data capabilities, and we see this continuing to be an area of differentiation for Paysafe versus others.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can de-risk some transactions where the market has abandoned many of these players\u2026we bring millions of consumers into the ecosystem. We bring unique ways to pay and access funds that a typical card processor certainly can\u2019t do. When you have that two-sided network, you change the conversation. When we speak to some of our largest iGaming customers, we\u2019re not only talking about take rates and comps, we\u2019re talking about revenue-generation, we\u2019re talking about attracting the types of customers that they want and they need in their ecosystem. That\u2019s a really, really powerful position to have.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\niGaming Expansion\n\nPaysafe is the global leader in iGaming payment processing, a space that is extremely difficult to enter due a very complex risk and regulatory landscape.\n\nImportantly, Paysafe's multi-year revenue projections do not include growth from their ongoing US iGaming expansion (projected at 55% CAGR). \u201cAt Paysafe, the iGaming market volume was estimated to be $3.4 billion in 2019, and is now projected to reach $47 billion in 2025.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of a US Supreme Court decision allowing state-legalized sports betting, Paysafe is actively laying the groundwork for their US expansion. They are already integrated with 75% of all US iGaming operators. They have first-mover advantage.\n\nAs Bill Foley says, \"we\u2019re seeding the future growth right now by state and by operator... The day a state opens up, we are there ready from a regulatory perspective, from a risk perspective, and from a product perspective. ...It\u2019s our job to be there first and to make sure we dominate.\"\n\nHe continues, \"It\u2019s going to be a land grab. We want to be out there about 10 miles ahead of everybody else... I have a vision that we should be THE digital wallet and have tie-ins with every major casino company that\u2019s headquartered or located in Las Vegas. There will be money to be made for everybody... We\u2019ve got a wide landscape we can attack. It\u2019s pretty exciting\u201d\n\nFund manager Dan Loeb agrees: \u201cWe believe the US is poised to become the largest online gambling market globally as it begins to deregulate state by state and Paysafe is exceptionally positioned to capitalize as the global market leader.\u201d\n\nCompass Point analyst Michael Del Grosso initiated coverage with an Outperform noting, \u201cPSFE operates in high-growth verticals, has a unique advantage in its consumer and merchant facing solutions, and offers exposure to a secular growth opportunity in the potential legalization of iGaming in the United States,\u201d\n\nSome headlines since Del Grasso wrote \u201cwe believe there is upside to our forecasts in the event of state-level legalization of iGaming.\u201d:\n\n* \"New York State Legalizes Online Sports Wagering\"\n* \"Maryland Online Sports Betting Bill Passes Legislature\"\n* \u201cNew Hampshire sports betting deal approved overwhelmingly; Hogan likely to sign\"\n* \"Arizona governor signs bill legalizing sports betting\"\n* \"Wyoming Legalizes Sports Betting\"\n* \u201cCaesars Entertainment (Paysafe partner) announced Official Sports Betting Partner of NFL\"\n* \u201cMichigan\u2019s online sports betting launch hailed a success, Ohio could follow this year\u201d\n* \u201cOhio legislators doubling down on legalized sports gambling\u201d\n* \u201cLouisiana Begins The Process of Legalized Sports Betting\u201d\n* \u201cPath to legalized Texas sports betting becomes more clear\u201d\n* \u201cNC lawmakers make push to legalize sports gambling to generate funding for schools\u201d\n* \u201cFlorida poised to offer sports betting under major gambling deal\u201d\n* \u201cLegal Sports Betting Could Get To California Sooner Than You Think\u201d\n* \u201cCanada legalizes single-game sports betting\u201d (Paysafe is market leader in Canada)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsistent Value Creation:\n\nFintel reports institutions are accumulating PSFE 21 times more than they are selling and yet the current price is lower than what was paid by respected fund managers like Dan Loeb (Third Point 41.5 million shares), David Tepper (Appaloosa Management, 8.5 million shares), Aaron Cohen (Survetta Capital, 13 million shares), Dipanjan Deb (Francisco Partners, 20 million shares), Leon Cooperman (personally owns 1.1 million shares) along with Wells Fargo (13 million shares) and Blackrock (8.3 million shares).\n\nThe current low price poses an interesting proposition for value investors.  In the time since those fund managers decided to invest, Paysafe has had zero bad news while quietly and systematically executing on their strategy to expand to new markets, invest in technology, leverage expertise in risk management and data mining, improve margins, and develop synergistic cross-selling opportunities.\n\nEssentially, none of the following developments in value creation have been priced in:\n\n* Dec. 15 \u2014 Paysafe launches Paysafecash in the US to enable online cash payments\n* Dec. 21 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Amelco to plug US sports books into unified payments platform\n* Dec. 23 \u2014 Paysafe enables online cash payments for Microsoft customers\n* Jan 11 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Colorado\u2019s BetWildwood to provide unified payment platform\n* Jan 13 \u2014 Paysafecard launches in Moldova\n* Feb 1 \u2014 Paysafe expands Virginia Lottery partnership to integrate Income Access, its EGR B2B award winning marketing platform\n* Feb 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Luckbox to roll out Skrill and Neteller payment services\n* Feb 18 \u2014 Paysafe expands partnership with ESL Gaming, the world\u2019s largest esports company\n* Feb 23 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill launches new fiat-to-digital currency withdrawal service\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Austria\u2019s A1 esports League\n* Feb 25 \u2014 Paysafe uses Snowflake to develop new cloud-based data science models\n* Feb 26 \u2014 Paysafe wins \u201cBest Omni-Channel Payment Solution\u201d 2021 MPE Award\n* Mar 1 \u2014 Paysafe partners with RentMoola to enable US renters to pay rent with Paysafecash eCash\n* Mar 4 \u2014 Paysafecard wins gaming industry SAGSE award for \u201cBest Payment Method\u201d\n* Mar 12 \u2014 Leeds United announces partnership with Skrill\\\\\n* Mar 15 \u2014 Paysafe expands U.S. partnership with PointsBet into Michigan\n* Mar 16 \u2014 Paysafe partners with Provema to enable online cash payments for loans and insurance purchases\n* Mar 18 \u2014 Paysafe announces new Board of Directors\n* Mar 19 \u2014 Paysafe to Power Payments for Play Alberta\n* Mar 25 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Skrill expands offering to US with Coinbase\n* April 1 \u2014 Paysafe\u2019s Neteller launches Knect customer reward program\n* April 1 -- Moody's upgrades Paysafe to B1; stable outlook\n* April 15 \u2014 Paulo Dybala signs as Skrill brand ambassador\n* April 21 \u2014 Paysafe achieves CarbonNeutral certification for 2021 and 2022\n* April 27 \u2014 Paysafe launches lifetime rewards for Skrill and Neteller customers\n* April 29 \u2014 Paysafe selects AWS for strategic cloud-based services as part of its cost saving restructuring\n* May 17 \u2014 Paysafe partners with TripGift to enable online cash payments for global gift giving\n* May 20 \u2014 Skrill USA launches Skrill Virtual Visa Prepaid Card in US\n* May 26 \u2014 REPAY partners with Paysafe to enable US merchants to accept online cash payments\n* June 1 \u2014 Skrill partners with Wix to support commence business growth\n* June 2 \u2014 Paysafe streamlines US SMB payments with SimplePayMe\n* June 3 \u2014 Paysafe and Golden Nugget expand partnership into Michigan iGaming market\n* June 7 \u2014 Paysafe expands US partnership with IntelliPay to offer online cash payments\n* June 23\u2014Swiss Residents Now Able to Settle Bills Using Paysafecash\n* June 29 \u2014 Paysafe expands FOXBet partnership into Michigan\n* June 30 \u2014 Paysafe Enables Online Cash Payments on Microsoft Store on Xbox\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe wins 2021 EGR B2B award for best \u2018Affiliate Software Supplier\u2019\n* July 8 \u2014 Paysafe Launches unique industry-leading global travel safeguarding model, offsetting risks of non-delivery of services due to events like Covid.\n* July 13 \u2014 Paysafe adds 20 new digital currencies to its digital wallet and expands this service to 11 new US states, bringing US presence to 48 states.\n* July 14 \u2014 Paysafe partners with WynnBet to provide US payment and marketing solution\n* July 19 \u2014 Paysafe expands into North American property management space with Smart Property Systems partnership to provide embedded payment solutions for property managers and tenants.\n* July 20 \u2014 Fantasy Sports Platform OwnersBox Launches New Affiliate Program with Paysafe\u2019s Income Access\n* July 21 \u2014 Paysafe Partners with Bankable, a global architect of scalable \u2018banking-as-a-service\u2019 solutions, to launch a broad range of integrated, omnichannel banking services.

This deal is a direct result of Paysafe\u2019s recently announced travel safeguarding model (July 8) which is unique in the payment industry in improving airline liquidity while reducing their costs and risks. \"Paysafe also allows airlines to offer travelers an extended choice of payment methods for direct sales. In addition to credit or debit card payments processed through Paysafe\u2019s leading payment gateway, travelers can also pay using the Paysafecash eCash solution as well as more than 100 other alternative payment methods, all protected from chargebacks.\" Based on travel in a normal year, this deal can potentially represent a transactional volume of $10 billion in eCash and $87 billion in credit and debit. (Many retail investors seem to not yet understand that Paysafe\u2019s gateway processes all sorts of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, eCash, and even PayPal.)\n* Aug 9 \u2014 Ambassador Cruise Line appoints Paysafe as payments processor\n* Aug 10 \u2014 Paysafe appoints Chirag Patel, former Head of Payments at Santander and Amazon Intl., as CEO of Digital Wallet division\n* Aug 16 \u2014 Beats revenue estimates, raises volume guidance 30%\n* Aug 16 \u2014 Paysafe announces the acquisition of Safety Pay\n* Aug 22 \u2014 Paysafe announces acquisition of viafintech\n\n&#x200B;\n\nM&A / inorganic growth:\n\nBill Foley, Chairman of Fidelity and now Chairman of Paysafe, recently reminded shareholders that Paysafe has, \u201can aggressive pipeline of M&A opportunities I am leading management in pursuing.\u201d\n\nInorganic growth through M&A is a major pillar of Paysafe\u2019s strategy going forward and it is significant that Bill Foley, a major shareholder, is leading the charge.  Foley is a known M&A synergy wizard, particularly in the financial services arena. He took Fidelity National Financial from $3 Million market cap to $10.8 Billion. 3,600X growth. Over just the last five years, Foley successfully grew Ceridian 3.3X ($4.2B to $14B), Dun & Bradstreet 5.6X ($2B to $11.3B), and Black Knight 8.7X ($1.6B to $14B).\n\nThrough his proven M&A playbook, Foley is also legendary for growing FIS from $1 billion to over $88 billion market cap: an 88x return. He says \u201cThose characteristics of FIS are right in line with what we plan on doing with Paysafe.\u201d\n\nFoley discusses the FIS/Paysafe comparison further: \u201cFIS operated in a highly fragmented industry. We utilize platform and technology stack to consolidate and drive organic and inorganic revenue growth and improved margins. FIS expanded its product offering, invested in technology, and improved its scale and margins of the business. Today, that $1 billion investment has a market capitalization of $88 billion. FIS has very similar characteristics to Paysafe \u2013 an attractive platform with a defensible market position. Upside from acquisition integration, platform consolidation and cross-selling. We will cross-sell, cross-sell, and cross-sell. There are multiple attractive acquisition opportunities that will strengthen our market position even further and we're positioned to win in key attractive high growth markets.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nValuation Metrics:\n\nAbove I compared Paysafe with PayPal.  A while back I looked at a basket of fintech peers including PayPal, Square, Nuvei, Repay, Shift4, Adyen, Affirm, BILL, GPN, and Paysign.\n\n\\- Paysafe reports 30%+ EBITDA margin, mid-to-high teen EBITDA growth, and a pro-forma $400+ million in free cash flow.\n\n\\- By comparison, a third of the peer group reported negative EBITDA, half reported negative EBITDA growth, and a third negative free cash flow.\n\n\\- Paysafe also has better EPS than over half the group and better Debt/EBITDA ratio than 3/4 of them.\n\nThe group's collective growth rate of \\~12.5% is in the range of Paysafe's 10-13% projections but the company's estimates may be intentionally conservative as they do not take into account M&A growth or their current expansion into US iGaming.\n\nSince 2017, Paysafe grew revenue 65% from $864 million to $1.418 billion (28% CAGR pre-Covid). In 2020, revenue stagnated due to restructuring and exiting high-risk Asian revenue channels.  In their last ER they noted, without those actions they would have reported 23% YoY revenue growth  But even if you include 2020\u2019s slow down, their overall revenue growth since 2017 was still 18% CAGR. This is roughly the same as PayPal\u2019s growth.\n\nGiven all the above factors, it seems fair to consider Paysafe's potential price based on an average of the multiples for the above peers:\n\nPaysafe\u2019s share price with average of sector peer multiples:\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $122.09\n* EV/Rev ratio : $83.91\n* EV/FCF ratio : $87.86\n\nAverage: $97.95\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMore conservative price after removing all outliers in each category which put PSFE share price over $100\n\n* EV/EBITDA ratio : $50.75\n* EV/Rev ratio : $44.64\n* EV/FCF ratio : $44.18\n\nAverage : $46.52\n\nIn a nutshell, the basket of sector peers has an average growth within Paysafe\u2019s conservative projections yet they trade at 350-750% higher multiples. With Paysafe having better fundamentals than most, it is hard to argue that this is proportionate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is not investment advice.  Just a collection of observations.  If I were to offer advise, I'd only suggest staying away from options.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSources:\n\nPaysafe Q2: [https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/\\_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_22bb7ead34a47affd0aaab44e42d92dc/paysafe/db/1111/9781/file/2Q21+Paysafe+Earnings+Presentation+vFinal.pdf)\n\nReuters : Paysafe $4.7B - [https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP](https://www.reuters.com/article/paysafe-m-a-foley-trasimene-idUSKBN28H1GP)\n\nPayPal Q2: [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2-21-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPayPal 2012 : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal)\n\nPayPal 2020 : [https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc\\_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf](https://s1.q4cdn.com/633035571/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-FY-20-PayPal-Earnings-Release.pdf)\n\nPaysafe 2012 : [https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908](https://www.investing.com/analysis/optimal-payments:-still-at-discount-despite-ebitda-growth-137908)\n\nPaysafe 2020 - [https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst\\_Day\\_presentation\\_March\\_9\\_\\_2021.pdf](https://www.paysafe.com/fileadmin/content/pdf/Analyst_Day_presentation_March_9__2021.pdf)\n\n[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/psfe)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paysafecard.com)\n\n[https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.paypal.com)", "id": "p9gzh3", "created_utc": 1629654058.0, "score": 327, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "This is the first time i like a DD here...Credit suisse also says buy....", "score": 110, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks.
