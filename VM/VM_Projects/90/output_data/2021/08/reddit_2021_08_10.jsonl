Notice that no institution on earth would ever follow the advice they expect you to accept as gospel?  \n\nWhat I'm telling you today you may look back on years from now as your pivotal moment.  It was for me.  You sound intelligent and driven.  I'm telling you to consider discarding all of your institutional dogma.  Tell yourself it's indoctrination that should be to be questioned, not worshipped.  Next, pretend *you're* in the multibillion dollar institution, the one that is successful and lucrative.  You're the investment director.  How blind and passive would Blackstone's investment directors be?  For me it was easy because I worked for a few of the top firms in the industry.  I saw it first hand.  But that's not necessary.  \n\nWhen you're in and among the vaunted money managers, you notice they have feet of clay, and that sometimes, perhaps often, there's things you know which they don't.
