{"title": "AMD strong upside for this week.", "selftext": "I honestly should have posted this last week because the trade is already in progress, but there is probably still time:\n\n**The DD:**\n\nAMD has strong upside for this week. There are two basic reasons for my view on this.\n\n1. Fundamental points:\n   1. Strong earnings reports over the past 3 quarters.\n   2. Despite strong earnings, no real price spike. Been hovering between 80-90.\n2. Technical points:\n   1. The stock cross the 9-day moving average on 2/8/2021\n   2. The stock formed a golden cross on 2/8/2021. This is very important because this stock has tried to form a golden cross 2 times previously and failed to do so within the past few weeks. However, this time it has formed the cross and it's continuing to go.\n   3. RSI is continuing to trend up, indicating there is still gas for positive price action.\n   4. Crossed 50 day moving average on 2/10/2021\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Top is price action on 9-day. Middle is MACD. Bottom is RSI. If you don't know what these terms mean then please look them up.](https://preview.redd.it/7hj2tc6jbrh61.jpg?width=659&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7859d033c6af8f430eddefcfd30d7960da6a2bf1)\n\nBasically, on the fundamentals this stock is \"due\" for a push up. On the technical side, we can see that it's starting to go up.\n\nOverall, the 9th would have really been a good time to enter the trade because most of the elevating factors had already formed. And now with the futures up it's likely going to open up a lot higher, but still I see room to go up.\n\n**The exit strategy:**\n\nIf you do decide to enter this trade, and it does become profitable for you, here is how you can look to get out.\n\n1. On the MACD, when the **green bar goes from a dark green to a light green just sell the stock.** The simple view is this: dark green means strong bullish, light green means it's reversing to bearish. Dark red means bearish. Light red means reversing to bullish. Obviously this is overly simplified and subject to exceptions - but it's the general rule and if you know it you're better off than if you don't know anything at all.\n2. If you want to stay in longer (because obviously none of this is guaranteed) you can wait until the price moves close to the 9-day moving average. Once it moves under that then I'd take all my money off the table. \n\nI use technicals as a piece of trading stocks, but I tend to never base an entire decision on trading stocks. Charts are useful because they give me more information and help me make decisions based on what is actually happening in the market. Essentially, they prevent me from making emotional decisions and allow me to think in a cool and collected way when I trade.\n\nDo with this what you will.
