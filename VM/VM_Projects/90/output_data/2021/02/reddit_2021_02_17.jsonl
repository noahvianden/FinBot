{"title": "Welcome to the Boomer EV play Fucking Ford $F", "selftext": "EDIT: [This right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbetsOGs/comments/lcaepi/ford_vs_ferrari_part_1_greasing_the_wheels/) is far far far superior to my ramblings. Please look at that for more, but as always, do your research you Ape.\n\nAlright here is the deal and I'm gonna tell ya. Everything right now is EV this, EV that, oooh heres a Lucid and theres a Lion, look at that NIO and wow what a Tesla! But what about the boomer version, what about the big money, classic company, total run up play of the EV market. Well I think its Ford and here are my reasons why:\n\nDisclaimer: Blah blah not financial advice, blah blah do your own DD, blah blah don't trust random internet strangers for financial advice ya retard.\n\n1. Right now Ford's Market Cap is just shy of $46 Billion. This is the Fourth largest automaker in the world in 2019 sorted by revenue. In other words, they are a big boy, they make cars, they've been doing it for over 100 years now, they know their shit. But still, they don't get much credit. Ford is often labeled the second biggest car company in America and never talked about. Why? They stale. You don't have to tell me they are boring, that's why I labeled this a boomer EV company. You invest in Ford for the dividend, because its stable, a high cap that's ole reliable. But here I'mma tell yew wat, that's changing. And the fact its perceived that way and is actually changing is gonna mean big big investment. Lets get to it.\n\nFord has a new CEO and his name is Jim Farley. Now this guy isn't the guy that's set the stage so far, and we will talk about that, but this guy has some unique energy.  In the last earnings call for GM and the one for Ford, they essentially reported the same thing. 4th quarter numbers were surprisingly good, company still lost some money, we are going to improve bottom line in 2021. But man oh man were the results different. Jim got on that phone and talked about taking warranty costs down and making 2021 a focus on tightening up the company even more, and boom the stock went up. I didn't even listen to the GM call, but the highlights were practically the same, and GM took a hit. The difference speaks for itself. Now if you want something of a character model for Jim but you are too lazy to look up and listen to video of him, just imagine Jim Farley as the modern day Tommy Boy (because you know... his cousin was Chris Farley.... who played Tommy Boy.... fucking young twats go watch the movie its hilarious!). He is determined to make Ford GreAT AgAIn!\n\n2) Now some comparisons. As we all know, Tesla's fundamentals don't matter. But the idea here is that if Ford starts announcing money moves, its fundamentals will stop getting in the way! First off, the most relevant brands to compare here are going to be Tesla and Rivian, why? Model Y and the R1T are what Ford will be directly competing against first. And I'm going to break out the R1T first.\n\nLets face it. Everyone that is reading this post has touched, seen, ridden in, or at least heard of the F-150. It is the most recognized and biggest single vehicle brand in the world. GM can occasionally make and sell more trucks then the F-150, but they have to do it under two brands (Chevy and GMC). Ford tried making a luxury F-150 under Lincoln, but it didn't sell as well as just making a luxury F-150 (think platinum editions). Why does this matter? Ford is going to make an electric F-150. This has been a rumor for so so so long, but the massive investment in Rivian and the latest confirmations have shown that Ford has put a lot of effort into developing an acceptable electric drivetrain for the F-150. Now lets look at the R1T that will be the direct competitor. Rivian is expected to IPO soon and is looking to get an initial evaluation of $50 billion. Oh wait, what's that? An EV company that is launching with 1 or 2 models wants to be a $50 billion company? And Ford is going to compete in that space with a similar product and is only currently a $46 billion company? Hmmmmm.... If the electric F-150 is teased in September and it is at all competitive with R1T that alone should double the stock value. Ford would be gaining a whole new set of customers with a stronger brand name and already established manufacturing base and quality, and they wouldn't need to fight the uphill battle of trying to get into Tesla's well established brand and market of small and luxury EVs, they are getting into EV pickups the same time as everyone else! This is arguably the biggest reason I think the stock is going to double this year, but it needs proper setup to truly understand the potential.\n\n3) Lets work back up the time line here. Ford can't just bust onto the scene with an electric F-150 and expect to take the cake and eat it too. Big boomer name auto companies are viewed as old and unmoving, they can't make changes, as someone I know tries to explain to me, \"Its suCH a BiG boAT Its gOInG to TAkE FoRevER to CHanGE CoUrSe!.\" What they fail to realize is that Ford has been making moves to switch it up for years. What did they result in? Why the Mustang Mach-E of course.\n\nThe Mach-E is currently one of the most polarizing vehicles in the American vehicle enthusiast communities right now. You gotta understand. Ford made it through years of selling lackluster (in my opinion dogshit) Mustangs on the name alone! It has an image, a brand, that carried the full lineup even when Mustangs were slow and didn't know how to make power and meet emissions (or be fun). And that branding means anything with the Mustang name attached should be a two seater coupe with power and loud, dirty, gas powered bad boy image behind it. Ford could have made the Mustang Mach-E a new model, they could have made it its own thing and launched it as a new EV, the start of a new era or some other friendly bullshit. But instead Ford said, \"we need eyes on this thing and we need to make a point with it. What should we do?\" and the one guy in the room who didn't give a fuck anymore said, \"Well call it a Mustang, that'll do it.\" And the fucking Chads did it! What's GM's big EV at the moment? The bolt, which they already burnt the branding on with dumb looks and weird commercials, and the Hummer, oh great a dead brand for people who need you to know they have a big swinging dick maybe. Ford is showing that they have the willingness to leverage their most recognized brands to launch a new EV image of the company. That's huge! And if the Mach-E does well, performs good, and gives a good impression to the car media people, that will be the real proper setup for the electric F-150. Especially since it can be compared directly to the Model Y. It'll be Ford vs Tesla, and all Ford has to do is go the 12 rounds, they don't even really have to win.\n\n4) So now we get into the boomer money and how its going to set this thing off. Now I know I talked about our favorite boomer auto CEO Jim Farley, but lets talk for a second about everything that's happened before he got there. Ford is exiting the sedan and car market in North America. Why? It doesn't make money. Why is Ford so concerned about making big money. Aside from it being a company, well its balance sheet doesn't look too good. Is it horrible? Meh, the Debt to Equity is still horrendous, but the rest of it isn't bad per se. Ford has been trimming and fine tuning its production for years to get out of the debt it took on during the financial crisis and the last thing they wanted to do was retool everything to make EVs. But despite having a ridiculous ratio they've snuck investing in EV, battery tech, charging tech, and autonomous into the budget over the years. And Jim is taking over and immediately talking about reducing warranty costs and on hand inventory and things, the traditional stuff that hits Ford's operating bottom line. This is great! Improve profitability, that's what boomer and institutional investment love to hear. So, do we think the stock could go down? Well, look at the bears, the short interest in the float is super super super low, something around 1-2%. No one thinks this stock is going lower. And that's a good thing. It means almost everyone in Ford is in it as an investment and those buys aren't going anywhere. And it means, this is the entry point, it takes off from here. As Ford starts to come up and we see a steady rise over this year more and more institutional money and boomer retail will get in for the value growth.\n\n5) As for gas. This is part of why I think Ford is a great all around sentiment change value investment. For years Ford has been releasing fun cars with the intent to rejuvenate the brand like the Focus RS and the Fiesta, but they were niche vehicles that still tried to be economic and whose base trims were still normal and boring. But it wasn't until recently that they have started to blatantly play into the enthusiast's desires in an attempt to build rep with actual car people again. Look at the Mustang GT350, GT350R, GT500, the Bronco, the new F-150 Raptor R. These aren't attempts to make a \"Green and eco friendly lineup\" no no no these are blatant fan favs that people have been screaming for for years! And branding is everything. And when you can already make bombass cars like these, people tend to trust you to make other things like that electric commuter car you really need.\n\n6) Finally we get to the last and arguably the biggest reason this stock could pop off. Fleet vehicles. Ford controls around 40% of the fleet vehicle market. Think about that. All those companies that need fleets of vehicles that you can think of, 2 out of 5 are Ford supplied. I personally work at a company that uses fleet vehicles as a perk for the upper management and you know what they all have? Ford F-150s. About 12 of them parked in a nice little row in the parking lot. And you know whats weird about that? The next row is of normal employees that want to be like management, and my beat to hell Dodge Ram from 20 years ago stands out like a sore thumb between another nice little row of pretty new F-150s. Its a weird effect, but my point being fleet vehicles is a huge market, and when they start going electric, Ford will be poised to take up even more market share. Not only will Ford be able to pick up sales from fleet vehicles, but Ford already offers electric transit vans, you know, the kinda vans that do last mile stuff like install your cable, or DELIVER YOUR AMAZON PACKAGES. Yeah, those types of vans. Fleets of those will be going electric soon. And government contracts? Oh you better believe Ford is gonna get its share of those through the Green new deal. Fucking A is it.\n\n7) And now we get into the latest and greatest stuff. Ford is investing in building electric where electric is going to sell well with a huge investment in Germany. But this also means that they think they can make more money competing directly against Tesla in Europe as well. Now that's confidence considering how crowded the EV market is in Europe already. But also, Ford keeps making money moves in the EV space and really focusing on building an EV side of the company instead of trying to transition its Gas side. This is good, it means that they hope to add value as opposed to transition it which is what will blow the roof off the market cap!\n\nAnyways, thats what I got. Its not great and I can talk for hours, but its an honest opinion.\n\nTL;DR Fuck you, that took a long time to write! Electric F-150, Mustang Mach-E, Ford not afraid to leverage its biggest brands, electric transit vans, fleet contracts, government contracts, exciting gas powered cars like GT350,GT500, Bronco, Raptor R, new Chad of a CEO Jim Farley who is modern day Tommy Boy, Improving fundamentals that Boomers care about, and coming out the gates this year swinging for Tesla. Also Rivian is gonna IPO for more than Ford is worth?\n\nIs this where you put emojis or is it supposed to be the title? \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nPosition:\n\n100 Shares and 1 17c and 1 20c for 1/21/2022\n\n25 Shares GME", "id": "llwvea", "created_utc": 1613575436.0, "score": 188, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "I keep 100 shares just so I can qualify for  a discount in case all the other manufacturers ran out of inventory.", "score": 72, "replies": [{"body": "yo I did not know this, thank you.

My Ford play is fucked, it showed up on WSB. Time to sell. \n\nJokes aside, this DD is not great. It\u2019s a riskier play than this DD makes clear, with a higher potential profit. In short, the perfect WSB gamble. \n\nHere\u2019s the bull: ef150. Replacing the postal service fleet. \n\nThe ef150 is an inevitability. And it\u2019s going to blow the fucking doors open. No fleet is gonna want to buy cyber trucks. But plenty of local fleets that run regular f150s and put 100-200 miles on them every day will fucking kill to get an electric truck with lower upkeep they can charge over night. The demand is there already for this truck. The supply is what\u2019s missing. And that\u2019ll spread to the general consumer once they see how rad the power train is and how amazing the torque is with these trucks. The added fuel savings are just a bonus, the real benefit is how fucking amazing the electric powertrain is going to be. Speaking as a recent Tesla owner, electric is the present and future, and anybody who doesn\u2019t have electric versions of their cars is missing the boat. The ef150 is going to be the most revolutionary EV since Tesla produced the model s and the model 3. They literally print money with the f150, and that won\u2019t change with the switch to electric. \n\nThe second big one is the postal service fleet. In March, the USPS is expected to make its final decision (although that could be delayed) on what it chooses to replace its aging fleet. The options have been narrowed down from over 60 bids to three potential finalists. One is a shithouse company called workhorse, that has produced something like 6500 total vehicles, and has a history of over promising and under delivering with a shady ceo. The demo cars they sent to be tested by the usps had to be canceled because they were having failures with important systems like \u201cthe brakes\u201d and hospitalizing usps test drivers. Somehow they\u2019re still in the running. The next brand is a Turkish hybrid company. This has some potential. Finally, there is a joint bid between F and OSK to use transit vans. The initial bid was for diesel vans, but Ford and Oshkosh have already stated they\u2019re ready to proceed with an electric version of the usps would prefer that. This contract is worth 6.5 billion. F and OSK have a pretty solid chance of securing this contract on their own, and while the usps is in charge of their own decisions due to the way the board of governors operates, Biden can absolutely put pressure on them if he has a certain preference. You know who wants to promote US made EVs? Biden. You know who wants to produce US made EVs? F/OSK. \n\nFinally, the dems seem to be reviving hopes of a further EV tax credit of $7,000 for the first 400,000 EVs sold which would be a big deal. \n\nThings are looking good for Ford. \n\n\n\nExcept: \n\nHere\u2019s the bear:\n\nBatteries. Fords plan for the battery they were going to use in the ef150 came from a South Korean competitor of LG. You know who just got slapped with a 10 year import ban for stealing trade secrets from LG? The same battery maker. There\u2019s already an allowance for them to continue with plans to make a factory in the US and make batteries for F for 4 years, but they\u2019ve said that the cost of that factory would take more than 4 years to pay off. Biden can intervene, or the case can go to the Supreme Court, but without this decision getting overturned, this is a major setback for the ef150 (and coincidentally vw\u2019s plans to build the ID4 in the US). There is precedent for presidents overturning these decisions in the name of state manufacturing security, and the last president to do it was Obama, but currently as things stand, this isn\u2019t great news for Ford. \n\nAdditionally, Ford has already announced their production is going to be limited by shortages in semiconductors this year. Even if Biden pushes help towards the semiconductor industry, it still takes time to ramp up production and it\u2019s not like TSM can just produce more chips, they\u2019re already at max capacity. \n\nBasically, If a bunch of things go right for Ford, it\u2019s going to fucking kill it. But it\u2019s risky, because all of those things need to go in Fords favor and there\u2019s a lot of room for shit to go sideways. I recently closed about 90% of my position in Ford because of this. \n\nPosition: 100 shares, 15 1/21/22 $12 calls. \n\nIt\u2019s a gamble. If Biden overturns this battery decision (quite possible, since he\u2019s been pushing US made EVs and Ford and VW are the two big mfgs that can actually make that happen besides Tesla, and there is historical precedent from an administration he was a part of), things will look much better. If Ford can get ahold of chips, it\u2019ll look even better. If they get this usps contract, holy shit. If the dems pass a further 7,000 tax credit for up to 400,000 EVs sold, holy fucking shit that\u2019s gonna be great for Ford. But there are a lot of \u201cifs\u201d on this one. \n\nThis is not financial advice. I don\u2019t really know shit.
