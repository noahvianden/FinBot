{"title": "Why stonks can only go up from here. An economic reason. Bears read this and you will get it.", "selftext": "The market will continue to go up despite every indicator that the market should go down. \n\nPrimer: The fed uses monetary policy to control the flow of money in the system. When they want to restrict money (lower inflation) they increase interest rates and increase banks reserve limits (saying banks must keep a certain amount of cash on hand so dont loan out as freely). \n\nIn 08 the fix to the recession was to open the flood gates. We printed new money, lowered reserve requirements and lowered interest rates. \n\nWe never recovered from it (interest rates were at 4-5% and are now at 2%.) The ideal would have been increased spending to increase inflation and over time interest rates would have risen. \n\nThe problem here is in 2010 when lending started up again people were buying houses at depressed prices from their 08 inflated prices. They could exactly raise rates on the people buying the homes in 2010 because that would put them upside down on their homes (interest rate goes up home value goes down). \n\nFast forward 2020 enter pandemic. Interest rates were already low and now the fed had to lower them more so banks could lend more to: people, companies, etc. That however wasn't good enough to move the needle they needed to basically create an artificial inflation (stemchecks) so the whole thing wouldn't seize up (think last Feb). So, the Fed saved us. \n\nNow, if they raise the interest rate there will be a broad market sell off, recent home buyers could be upside down on their loans and the economy isnt anywhere near ready to come roaring back. It would kill the economy. \n\nRates HAVE TO GO UP (google Japan early 90s real estate). Yellen knows this Powell knows this. The only way to offset the market selloff then is with a UBI which will inadvertently dump back into stocks in earnings or investments. This is the catalyst for home prices to increase. \n\nHome prices will increase because a UBI will cause a rent seeking problem. Rent will go up and the price of housing will go up equal to the amount of rent. \n\nSo when home values get to high banks lose their primary money making product and will revert back to equities (stocks) which will continue to push markets higher. \n\nBasically the market will continue to climb because if it falters at this point it will trigger a much larger collapse and the fed and treasury are no longer equipped to deal with a crash. Thus it is in everyone's best interest to keep the markets up. \n\n1) interest rates low\n2) interest rates lower\n3) cant increase interest rates without a crash\n4) create artificial inflation via UBI\n5) housing prices spike, interest rates begin to go up (propped by UBI)\n6) people are priced out of buying homes, banks pour money into markets. \n\nStocks only go up.", "id": "lmonx7", "created_utc": 1613660496.0, "score": 92, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "Until a retard enters Fed, raises rates and breaks the cycle.

There is a trend towards cloud gaming yes but I think the general trend into enthusiast gaming/pc building is substantiall greater than into cloud gaming but you could see that diffrent I guess. But even if the main computing gets centralized people will still need keyboards, mouse, headphones,... and when they pay monthly for the cloud gaming they will have even more money to put towards those components. Actually its even better than that. You will still need a computer even if the calculation is being done from the cloud, your pc has to be the user interface so calculation heavy componants like your CPU, GPU will be less important, things that Corsair does not make. Instead you will need everything else still: case, psu, ... and when your pc does not have to be all beafy anymore you will want it to atleast look cool and thats where corsair products come in.

But this is extremely far away and we are still in the \"pipe dream\" phase.\n\nThe things I believe you are inaccurate about are your assumptions about how cloud computing is advancing and what that means for the future of hardware. Corsair provides cases, power supplies, cooling, storage, and memory. All of these products are no longer going to be needed by the consumer as soon as the network bottleneck is fixed. This is one of the main reasons 5G is so big, because we get closer to solving the throughput issues. Again, we are still not to the point where a full cloud alternative is competitive in performance with a physical desktop, but we are sure on our way and it is inevitable we will be there in 5-10 years.\n\nWith GPU, CPU, Memory and Storage all moved to the cloud, customers will no longer have anything that needs air or liquid cooling, customers will also have no need for a power supply because the peripherals all work off a power strip, and if none of these products are needed then there is no reason for a case because it would just be empty.\n\nIf Corsair can adapt and grow beyond just a peripheral play in the long term they can stand a chance, but my money will be on their cloud competitors that don't face the issues of scaling up a hardware business while the world is trending to the cloud.\n\nIf you are looking for a shorter-term trade I can understand your perspective and relative to Corsair's direct competitors I think that they are going to do well, but I am bearish on the consumer space for computer parts as a long-term hold.", "score": 0, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8123363852500916}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.8098058700561523}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.038469452410936356}, {"body": "I might buy some when it drops down to 20", "score": -6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15632595121860504}, {"body": "No one cares about shares.
