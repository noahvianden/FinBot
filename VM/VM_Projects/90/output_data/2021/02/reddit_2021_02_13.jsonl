{"title": "$SOS (SOS Limited) undervalued and may blow up in the near future", "selftext": "SOS Ltd. is undervalued (imo) and unnoticed player in the crypto world. Its share price is now **$7.44** (actually \\~$4 few days ago). I am writing this post because I think this stock has potential for a huge profit when comparing to stocks already grew up like **MARA ($38)** and **RIOT ($49)**. I am certain that $SOS can actually hit **$30** in the near future.\n\n**TL;DR at the bottom**\n\nCrypto is getting more and more attention when **Cathie Wood** and **Elon Musk** being bullish on it. **Tesla** bought about **1.5b** of BTC and is going to accept it as a payment method. BTC hit its ATH and helped MARA and RIOT explode. As BTC's price going up, it will also help **$SOS going up**.\n\nWhen comparing $MARA or $RIOT to $SOS, you can find that $SOS has only gone up around 250% (actually only 100% few days ago) when $MARA, $RIOT going up over **1500%** and **1100%** respectively in the last three months. $SOS is just a train with **untapped potential**.\n\nWhen comparing $MARA or $RIOT to $SOS then we can see that $SOS has been unnoticed so far and with those two companies going up over **1500% and 1100%** respectively in the last three months while SOS has only gone up around 200%. This is just **untapped potential**.\n\n$SOS has a market cap of $484 million. Take a look at others like MARA and RIOT. MARA currently has a market cap of $3.6b and RIOT has a $3.3b market cap. With the catalysts I will mention below, I can see $SOS going at least **5x** this year from the current price. For the sake of being conservative, I will only give it a **price target of $30**. (Market cap \\~$2b)\n\n***About SOS Limited***\n\nSOS is an emerging block-chain-based and big data-driven marketing and solution provider, with a nationwide membership base of approximately **20 million** in China. Recently, SOS has outlined its strategy in **block-chain and crypto**, which include a series of initiatives to expand its business into crypto mining as well as **crypto security and insurance**. The core infrastructure of SOS' marketing data, technology and solutions to insurance and emergency rescue services is built on big date, block-chain-based technology, cloud computing, AI, satellite, and 5G network, etc. We have created a SOS cloud emergency rescue service software as a service (SaaS) platform with three major product categories: basic cloud, cooperative cloud, and information. This system provides innovative marketing solutions to clients such as insurance companies, financial institutions, medical institutions, healthcare providers, auto manufacturers, security providers, senior living assistance providers, and other service providers in the emergency rescue services industry.\n\nSOS Ltd. is a **first of its kind** in the crypto industry. SOS is the first **crypto insurance**, **crypto bank** and on top of that they're also **mining crypto**. They're mining BTC and ETH. Their goal is to be the first complete **crypto institution**.\n\nRecently they just bought a **cloud computing company** which is capable enough to mine **3-4** **BTC daily and over 50 ETH**. Now with the rising value of crypto their revenue is only going to keep going up.\n\nAnnounced on February 5th, SOS Ltd. entered a framework agreement with Leibodong Hydropower station in Heijang to secure **cheap and renewable electricity** for its cloud crypto mining center.\n\nAdding on top of that, February 9th, they announced their receipt of **5000 pcs of Mining rigs** which arrived ahead on schedule. This rigs can generate about **BTC Hash Power 175P and** **ETH Hash Power 350G**. If these machine operates as expected, **the annual ROI (return on investment) is projected to be significant based on the current crypto price momentum**. The seller also confirmed that they have enough inventories of crypto mining rigs and that they can fulfill the next two batches of shipments as scheduled. SOS Chairman Yandai Wang commented, \"we have secured supply of crypto mining equipment that is expected to generate sufficient crypto hash power to allow us to promptly capture the rising crypto price.\"\n\n$SOS actually purchased **15645** Mining Rigs. They have another **10645** Mining Rigs on the way which will provide good news as catalysts in the future when they arrive. From my understanding, MARA only has near amount of mining rigs right now but is valued at 10x $SOS current price.\n\n$SOS just announced a $110 million direct offering on 12 Feb. This sent the price down to **$5.48 (-13%)** before it promptly skyrocketed back up to close at **$7.44, up 18%** from the previous day despite the offering.\n\n$SOS has announced intent to acquire FXK Tech Corporation(\"FXK\"), a Canadian-based company, specializing in the block-chain technology consulting and operations and support for crypto exchanges and cloud crypto algorithmic power exchanges, to further extend SOS ecosystem of block-chain and crypto, **as well as to expand its operations to North America.**\n\n***Financials***\n\nSOS Ltd.'s balance sheet is just beautiful. Here we can see that they have a really good amount of cash in hand to improve and their debt is only \\~$200k.\n\n[Balance sheet source](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/sos/statistics/)\n\nMarket cap is 484m with the share price of $7.44 as of market close 12.02.2021.\n\nIf we take a look at the performance of the stock we can see that it hasn't had its boom yet unlike $MARA and $RIOT who have gained over 1000% in the last few months. This gives me **more confidence** that there might be a **breakout** soon when more people find out about this company.\n\n$SOS is projected to make more than **$277k USD/day** in revenue once all **15645** Mining Rigs are running. This is projected from the current crypto prices (Actually it's only $200k USD/day before tesla bought BTC, the price of BTC is going up). So you can understand the potential of $SOS.\n\n***Technical indicators***\n\nThe technical indicators are also looking positive. We're seeing a **good volume increase** which usually indicates a breakout soon and it getting more traction. We recently just **broke the last resistance** ceiling as well and we are in a continuous **upwards trend** at the moment. Volume increase is also usually a **bullish indicator**.\n\n**Summary/TL;DR**\n\nSOS Ltd. is a stock which **has not boomed yet** (or just started to boom maybe) in this bull market. We still have chance to get on the train before it leave the station. SOS has a great balance sheet and positive technical indicators showing an **upwards trend** at the moment.\n\n**SOS's revenue will increase** by each year as we can expect BTC and ETH to soar in the next few years, probably even few months as BTC just hit a new **ATH**. BTC has a lot more confidence now growing as well since the most well known and richest man on Earth, **Elon Musk**, just invested into BTC worth $1.5b.\n\nWith good performance this week, we can expect it to do better in the future.\n\nPosition: 1800 @ $5.5\n\nUnfortunately for those reading this post but not yet holding $SOS, this post maybe a little bit late. $SOS announced an offering on Friday (yesterday), so it was the best time to buy the dip (although it actually close at up 18% finally). I bought in at $5.5 yesterday. I am 90% sure that $SOS will blow up next week and it may be hard to find an entry point. Its stock price somehow managed to go up with offering news......\n\n*\\*I am not a financial advisor, nor is this investment advice. It's purely me sharing my opinion.

{"title": "Intel's hidden gem, Mobileye", "selftext": "Yesterday I put out my first DD piece on Intel, the most undervalued high cap company in the US stock market. Of course it left a sour but familiar taste in the mouths of Lisa Su's cuck army and AMD fanboys. Today I'm here with another treat for you, don't be shy I know deep down you like it.\n\nHonestly Intel has so many juicy bits of DD to squeeze out its hard to pick where to start.\n\n[from Intel's 10K pg17](https://preview.redd.it/oxulb5pl7ah61.png?width=733&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed1d4f2b7e110578ceafa5d0cb790a7fb85d476d)\n\nNevertheless I know you are hungry so Ill start with an appetizer.\n\nMobileye\n\nDon't be fooled, If Mobileye was an independent company it would probably be you guys' main dish and desert after it had been pumped to a 100B market cap like many of the \"tech of the future\" sector stocks. The reality is, Mobileye is the future and the 100B market cap would probably not be that outlandish in this market. One word:\n\nAutonomous vehicles.\n\nThat's right, a market that is in its most infant state but that has the potential to be bigger than the United Kingdoms economy by 2030.\n\nDon't take it from me \"The market is then expected to recover and grow at a CAGR of 12.7% from 2021 ad reach $1,191.8 billion in 2023. The market is expected to reach $1,642.9 billion in 2025 growing at a CAGR of 17.4%, and $3,195.0 billion in 2030 growing at a CAGR of 14.2%. \"1\\*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Grand View Research](https://preview.redd.it/g8cc9qtt9ah61.png?width=627&format=png&auto=webp&s=77d431d2127534538eab9ca539da8a4c65297485)\n\nMobileye is one of the leaders in the autonomous vehicle industry and is poised not just to grow in market share but to take over. Last year they brought in for Intel a cool Billion, yeah I know its nothing much, its just double AMDs net earnings last quarter and about 1 and a bit% of Intel's annual revenues. Oh yeah I know you must be seething at the way I am phrasing this.\n\nProfessor Amnon Shashua (CEO of Mobileye) who you will be calling Daddy very soon when your asymmetric relationship with Su Bae doesn't work out had some interesting things to say this year, \" Despite unprecedented challenges to the auto industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic, we secured more than 37 new design wins, including deals with major OEMs such as Geely and Ford. We are currently active in 49 production programs1  across over 25 OEMs.\"\n\nIntel also acquired Moovit to facilitate Mobileyes dominance, \"We acquired Moovit to accelerate Mobileye's MaaS offering. Moovit is known for its urban mobility application and brings Mobileye closer to achieving our plan to become a complete mobility provider, including robotaxi services.\"\n\nFuck Tesla fake autonomous driving program, when the robo taxis do come they will have mobileye in them.\n\nIntel bought Mobileye for 15.3 Billion $ in March 2017 when they were at the start of a year that brought them 200 million $ in revenue. You see what I mean when I say this could be valued at 100B in market cap given the current market (Its a type of bubble(might not pop but its still a bubble), IDGAF what you say).\n\nBut Intel's market cap is only 250B? What's going on here Mr Market? Have you been eating crayons? Its alright, a little nudge and you will wake up.\n\nBy buying Intel you are in effect able to buy a stake in the future of autonomous vehicles at tremendous discount.\n\nLike I said, this is just a little treat. Intel is a full meal and it has a lot to give.\n\n1700 INTC shares, 500 April 16th 80$ strike calls and yesterday before close I added a little 50 Feb 26th 65$ strikes for good measure. Your wife's boyfriend is counting on you to be smart and buy Intel calls or you wont be able to subsidize their trip to the Maldives.\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/28/2150806/0/en/Global-Autonomous-Cars-Market-2020-to-2030-Opportunities-and-Strategies-with-COVID-19-Growth-and-Change.html#:\\~:text=28%2C%202020%20(GLOBE%20NEWSWIRE),added%20to%20ResearchAndMarkets.com's%20offering.&text=The%20market%20is%20then%20expected,reach%20%241%2C191.8%20billion%20in%202023](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/12/28/2150806/0/en/Global-Autonomous-Cars-Market-2020-to-2030-Opportunities-and-Strategies-with-COVID-19-Growth-and-Change.html#:~:text=28%2C%202020%20(GLOBE%20NEWSWIRE),added%20to%20ResearchAndMarkets.com's%20offering.&text=The%20market%20is%20then%20expected,reach%20%241%2C191.8%20billion%20in%202023). \\*1\n\n[https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/autonomous-vehicles-market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/autonomous-vehicles-market)\\*2\n\nAnd I leave here a link to Intel's very elucidating 10K that I know you wont read.\n\n[https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings?form\\_type=10-K&year=2021](https://www.intc.com/filings-reports/all-sec-filings?form_type=10-K&year=2021)\n\nenjoy,", "id": "lj5soc", "created_utc": 1613240040.0, "score": 46, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "As a huge AMD fanboi, you'd be a fool to dismiss the value of Intel, as a company.\n\nWhile they are facing extremely strong challenges on many fronts from AMD, they are still the market leader in many of them and, as such, will still have value for a long time to come.", "score": 30, "replies": [{"body": "What you speak, is the truth.", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.22014454007148743}, {"body": "Intel has been trading at or worse than S&P for years now.

Even legendary chip architect Jim Keller noped the fuck out last spring after just 2 years at the company.  Back in the Larrabee days, there was a war of words with NVIDIA.

Intel going 10nm is a good thing, however how it will stack up to AMDs 7nm especially in 2022 is a big question. One thing I do know is that Intel's 10nm is widening the devide and further splitting the market between performance and productivity, which ultimately is going to make the market more competitive, and price/performance is something that will have to be seen. Judging by Intel's previous generations, they'll have to make some big leaps to make that worth it for the customer.\n\nAs for portable and mobile platforms, this could be a good thing, and with 2021 being such a terrible year for desktop electronics in general this might be good breathing time to be looking at Intel moving forward.\n\nI personally have bailed on upgrading my PC in 2021, this was the year to do a complete overhaul however due to the GPU issue I wont be buying anything from AMD or Intel, or Nvidia for that matter. Assuming my situation isn't isolated just to me it's fair to assume that average customers will be in similar mind sets, and I'm not convinced that 2021 is a good year for the CPU market, unless it comes to people who specifically are working with CPU productivity based tasks.\n\nThis sounds like a nonsensical rant, but just my perspective on the current situation. Nvidia are leading in the GPU market, AMD are leading in the CPU market and Intel are trailing behind, essentially still selling 8th gen CPUs disguised as 10th gen at a more affordable price. But with AMD providing chips for both desktop as well as next gen gaming consoles, this is also something worth consideration, as manufacturing of AMDs architecture is in high demand.\n\nDo your DD and make a good call, Intel are definitely, while a staple, very much an underdog which could bounce back in better ways than we can imagine.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Thank you for your perspective.

There is also the GPU market as well which AMD are slowly creeping up on Nvidia, although I find it unlikely that they will overtake Nvidia any time soon.\n\nFor Intel to really make any kind of significant gains at least to me falls on the success of their 10nm process, as if they get get the same level of efficiency as AMD for a competitive price as opposed to an inflated one, they aren't bound to Sony and Microsoft for their architecture nor to a struggling GPU market that can't even continue to manufacture.\n\nThat really is the struggle of the market right now, but as long as AMD keep making their 7nm process better or even shrinking the die further with the same success they had with Zen, it's a gamble to put your chips on Intel as a company that will see significant growth in such a competitive space.\n\nBut at the very least it seems 2021 is a good year to get some solid DD done as not much is happening and I don't see Intel making any huge gains at least when it comes to their desktop line.
