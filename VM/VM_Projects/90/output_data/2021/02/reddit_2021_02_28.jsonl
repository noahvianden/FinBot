No fundamental based investor buys a company with a PE ratio over 1.000. Just none! At least no one who knows a bit about value investing, valuation and reading financial information. People in here will tell different, but thats ok. Everyone needs to have his own opionion. You can justify a high PE with growth rates. If you want to be optimistic- you can say the PE ratio can be double the growth rate. Which means (assuming a growth rate of 500% per year), Tesla would be the only existing company in like 3-4 years. **-> Fundamental based investors only sell right now (or sold months ago) or hold very longlonglonglongterm, but not buying.**\n2. **Momentum investors** (looking at the chart, but not daytraders!). They had a very good time last year and (imo) were the ones who drove Tesla stock that high. Tesla was one of the most positive momentum stocks over the whole year. Now the momentum seems to shift, which will make them sell their shares and move on to other stocks. I am not a technical analyst, neither am I very good at it. But it is easy to see the stock shifted from positive chart signals to negative ones. For example a very important indicator, the MACD, created a strong sell signal on friday on a weekly chart. This could be the reason why the stock was sold heavily in the last minute of friday. Some momentum investors anticipated that the stock will close at around $670 which will strengthen the downtrend momentum in the technicnal analysis. Interestingly, most momentum traders are instituions and not retail traders. I didn't know that for a long time. **-> Momentum investors will start to sell right now due to the technical downtrend.**\n3. **Noise traders/investors** (most retail Investors). Somewhere between 1 and 2. Have no idea how the stock market really works and what they are actually doing. But they think they are smarter than \"the market\". They lose money in the longterm and fuel the investors from 1 and 2. **-> Think they buy the fucking dip because they missed the party last year and so one. They don't recongnize the party is over for now and they are late. They are the most of the buyers right now.** *(*[*https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/noise-trader/*](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/noise-trader/)*)*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So as a conclusion, the sell-off at the end of friday was made by the momentum investors.** But that's just my analysis.

Fundamental investors. No fundamental based investor buys a company with a PE ratio over 1.000. Just none!\n\nIs that a good thing?? Like, does that mean that no fundamental investor has ever bought any shares in Tesla for over a decade?\n\nI think the lowest (positive) PE ratio Tesla has ever had was over 500, and it was only under 1,000 for a quarter or two. Does that mean that fundamental investors were buying Tesla for only 6 months out of the last decade and missed one of the best performing stocks of the last decade?\n\nI don't know if it makes sense to be a fundamental investor if it means you're not allowed to buy companies with \"bad\" PE ratios? It seems like you'd miss out on an the best performing stocks?

That says to me that they're probably targeting 0 GAAP profit, and any EV credit sales that come in during the quarter are just a bonus.\n\nI think that's the right choice, and if they didn't care about the stock price at all, they should maybe even be targeting a little more growth and small GAAP loses every quarter?\n\nThey're strongly cash flow positive, so GAAP profits or loses don't really matter in the short term.

In fact I wasn't worried at all until that sell-off. Pullback is not an issue. But when a stock drops 2% in a matter of 10 minutes on friday before close(AAPL) It leaves you wondering what monday will be like. \n\nI agree with everything you say about TSLA. But im worried the more red we will se the more snowball effect it will create. There are people up 100s of % and I can see them locking that profit it. As I said I dont expect TSLA going up every day. I was fine with the drop to 620 last week, and in fact I even bought in at 670. But the drop in the last 10 minutes of Friday left me cautious. Never mind the huge volatility during the day. If monday will be somewhat calm, even if red I have no issues with it. But if it's a nose dive I dont see how someone can look at that and say its a normal pullback. Again I believe it's more of a snowball thing and the lower it will go the more people will sell it, exactly because of how much it has gone up.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": "Dude you keep talking about stock movement in the last 10 min Friday like it\u2019s the tell all.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "It's not.
