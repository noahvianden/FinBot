{"title": "What are the most common mistakes you see newbies make?", "selftext": "I recently got into the market with this whole GME debacle (still ongoing?), but it has made me more interested in the market as a whole. I've spent most of the past two weeks reading about topics such as DD, some of the stocks that are popular here and on other investing-related subreddits, and the basics of options (CC, CSP, long calls/puts, wheel). At the same time, looking through a variety of stocks makes me feel like a lot of potential for putting some money into the market now and it feels like the majority of moves would be profitable. I recognize part of that is likely because of the current bull market. However, if you were to just stick with buying stable stocks (e.g. GOOG, AAPL) or even buying/selling options barely OTM with a decent expiration date, seems like you could make pretty easy money.\n\nI can foresee a couple of scenarios where there is potential for big losses:\n\n1) Market crashes. Certainly many posts saying we are due for a correction and we did have one in 3/2020.\n\n2) Meme stocks and buying in at the wrong time\n\n3) Options trades you don't understand\n\n4) Trying to make plays that are just too risky (0DTE, far OTM weeklys)\n\nIs it as simple as moderating risk and doing your research or are there other mistakes that you often see and I should be aware of?", "id": "lek0hf", "created_utc": 1612693529.0, "score": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 96, "comments": [{"body": "Getting on the hype too late, chasing highs", "score": 110, "replies": [{"body": "fuel ghost sophisticated plate library deer aback skirt coherent bow\n\n *This post was mass deleted and anonymized with [Redact](https://redact.dev)*", "score": 48, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.009303256869316101}, {"body": "was thinking about maybe getting a LULU, ETSY stock, what u say its too late??
