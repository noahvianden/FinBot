I think Tesla (and daddy musk) has a long runway ahead especially if they\u2019re going to grow productions 50% compounding YoY in auto sales which means that by Apple makes their first car in 2025, Tesla will be producing $2.5million electric vehicles. Their current automotive gross margins are 21% in comparison to 2.1% from Ford, gm, etc.\n\nTesla\u2019s auto business: has a lot of potential and there\u2019s a big runway in selling FSD which adds ~80% margin to every sale. \n\nTesla insurance: they\u2019re hiring actuaries everywhere so they can sell insurance to Tesla owners. One of the most important thing that ALL insurance companies want to know is HOW you drive. Usually they\u2019ll give you some discount to put in an obd sensor in your car for a few months and give you a rate accordingly. Now imagine a car that already does this so they know every action the driver takes and can understand risk every second on the road. Imagine an insurance company that can gather all camera feeds from the cars to evaluate accidents/damage claims and pass savings down to the customer. Win win. Huge potential.\n\nTesla Solar: with the new administration and their focus on renewable, solar will be front and center. With an existing relationship with over 1.3 million auto customers, Tesla will easily convert many of them to solar owner - FYI Tesla has the cheapest solar by a long margin. If even 10% of the total households in the US get basic solar added it\u2019ll equate to over $1T in yearly revenue.\n\n\nTesla Semi: this is one I\u2019m super interested in. Walmart and other logistics businesses already bought thousands on back order. Compared to a 18 wheeler, a semi is 35% more efficient (and faster) meaning 35% or more reduction in transportation cost expanding margins for businesses.
