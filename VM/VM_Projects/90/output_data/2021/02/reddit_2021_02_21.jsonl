Because these are computers, they can also find and see patterns where humans can\u2019t, or simply would never get to because of just how many different permutations exist between variables in even relatively simple systems i.e. data analytics which is what Palantir offers on the civilian side of things in regards to their supply chain management software.\n\nThe software is quite literally making random or previously unnoticed connections and relationships out of the thousands of variables that exist in a companies incredibly complex supply chain network. This is why it\u2019s been mentioned that average Joe employees with access to Palantir\u2019s software can in some ways become as valuable to a company as a hired PhD. Because before this software existed it would usually only be PhD\u2019s/engineers discovering these connections that lead to efficiency improvements in a network but obviously at a much slower pace compared to an \u201cA.I. Trained computer\u201d. This software also makes it possible to track terrorists, serial killers, improve the efficiency of airlines by more efficiently allocating planes, pilots, cargo, etc. because it can keep track of far more variables, make random connections and relationships that would go unnoticed to the human eye, and alert a human to look into those connections/relationships. Serial killers have tons of patterns, it\u2019s a key part of their very nature, but when local police departments only have small pieces of the puzzle they\u2019ll never come close to solving the case because the case is occurring on a statewide, or maybe even national level.\n\nAs for the military side of things, you can train satellites to be able to recognize certain shapes or patterns from 120 miles up via machine learning and voila instead of having entire teams of people sifting through endless amounts of grainy photographs for missile silos, missing a lot of what they\u2019re looking for, and taking a long time to do it, you have a program that spits it out instantaneously. \n\nFighting a war? Why not log and record every move your opponent makes, so much so that you begin to know them better than they know themselves. The computer watches and logs every move they make to the point where once they get enough data points they\u2019re able to accurately predict with great success rates what their opponents next move is going to be maybe before they even know it themselves. We are creatures of habit after all, we just do a horrible job of noticing it. The same concepts would apply to fighter jets or drones without pilots. This technology will decide who is the dominant force in the world for the next century and that is why I believe in Palantir.
