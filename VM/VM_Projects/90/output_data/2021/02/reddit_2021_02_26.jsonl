{"title": "A Blackberry Discussion", "selftext": "Initially posted this on [bb_stock ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lsxrq9/stop_whining/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and was hoping to get some sort of intelligent feedback but should have not made that assumption. Figured I\u2019d come here and see if I can solicit some better ideas. I\u2019m new to r/stocks so if I\u2019ve screwed up on some of your rules please let me know.\n\nI generally invest in high growth data stocks as I work in the industry and I\u2019m beginning to think blackberry will be nicely positioned in a couple of years to dominate and worst case the rising tide will raise all the boats.\n\nSmarter people can break down the financials so I want to focus on positioning, markets, branding, board members and the AWS partnership. I\u2019m doing my best to clean up my last post because I realize this is a higher level of discourse.\n\n\n1. Repeat CEO: you\u2019re not paying for someone to learn on the job, John Chen has done it before and can handle the stress. I\u2019m thinking this is his swan song. \n\nHe has a 90 million dollar bonus at a $30 USD price point for 10 days by 2023. don\u2019t think CEOs generally miss out on 90 million dollar bonuses but hey what do I know.\n\n\n2. Potential market size: IOT security and data collection. I personally care the most about their auto investment in QNX and IVY but the board of directors reflect a whole slew of other bets that are also potentially majorly profitable. \n\nThe military side of the equation may become more material with the New board member: Lisa Disbrow. \nOnce again I\u2019ll defer to smarter people to do market evaluation and sizing. \n\n\n3. Sales orientation/cycle: this is a company that usually deals with governments, financial institutions, and enterprise clients. They are used to the longer and more complex sales cycles associated with this so there will be no learning curve when approaching larger clients.\n\n\n4. [Board of directors:](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/board-of-directors) I like to follow money and influence.\n\n\nInteresting highlights:\n\nJohn Chen\u2019s: CEO that delivered an exit of Sybase. Really strong history of maintaining relationships in China and on trade boards with China. See BOD link above.\n\nPrem Watsa: Canada\u2019s Warren Buffett. Reddit deity of justifying this investment. Fairfax financial and a value investor. He brought in John Chen\n\nMike Daniels: John Chen\u2019s Sybase buddy and cybersecurity executive. Well positioned to influence across the cyber security industry\n\nTimothy Dattels: TPG Capital major investor in Asia.\n\nLisa Disbrow: New Board member. She is the military connection and was Senate-confirmed Under Secretary of the United States Air Force, and she served as Acting Secretary of the U.S. Air Force from January 2017 to May 2017.\n\nRichard Lynch : Ex-cto of Verizon wireless.\n\nDr. Smaldone Alsup: Pharma positioning, take a look at [PharmApprove](https://pharmapprove.com) and you\u2019ll get a better sense of her speciality working on positioning.\n\nBarbara Stymiest: Big player in Canada. Current portfolio includes: director of George Weston Limited, Sun Life Financial Inc. and the University Health Network, and is Chair of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. For you Americans out there George Weston is the really big name there.\n\nWayne Wouters: Strategy and policy advisor on the government front. at one point he was Deputy Minister to the Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nJust wanted to give a high level breakdown of the board and if you can give a more complete picture on benefits and risks of these players I\u2019d love to hear it.\n\n\n5. BLACKBERRY IVY:  Generally I don\u2019t look that deeply into products but I\u2019ll do you all a favour and break down the branding and real market value to both companies.\n\nIt\u2019s an Amazon partnership but it\u2019s called Blackberry Ivy. Does that strike you as being a bit interesting? They avoided the Amazon brand name on purpose. BB owns the commercial relationship limiting Amazon\u2019s exposure to the customer and fear of being screwed by the 2nd largest company in the world.\n\nAuto execs are all aware of competition risks coming from Apple and Google. Also on the Google front they have learned from advertising that Google like to own the data. Tesla is a direct competitor so I don\u2019t see much risk losing OEM business to then.\n\nIt\u2019s been branded blackberry and avoided touching anything associated with data ownership to make the product more attractive to the OEMs.\n\nThey are looking for a monopoly on the censors and data transfer and have what seems like a 2 year head start. \nThis is a rounding error for Amazon but material for bb. Amazon payoff will be the number of clients that transfer to AWS because of ease of integration and reduced costs of moving the data.\n\n6. Blackberry and Apple: every single employee of blackberry knows what happened with Apple and knows what happens when you sit comfortably on a lead as opposed to paying offence. If you are worried about a company culture that is stagnant and moving too slowly go find someone who is currently winning not a comeback kid.\n\n7. Negatives: \nShit brand with reputation as an loser. \n\nARR: the only thing that really matters. Of course Ivy is a subscription that wasn\u2019t a surprise. They need to show positive growth and then you can be considered a 10-20x revenue cap. Do that for 4 quarters and then you can be a cool kid and get to 50x.\n\n\nTL;DR.

The amount of cross-dependency required for IVY is weird to be just a partnership to expand their customer base for AWS. \n\n2. You are spot on about their positioning with OEMs. They have every advantage at being the de-facto market leader, provided OEMs adopt the services. However, from what I gathered from their recent webinar, the OEM play is more aimed at creating additional revenue streams for these partners, than \u2018owning data\u2019 and batting with Google, etc over data ownership. \n\n3. This is a category creating product. By definition, Blackberry and Amazon are self-disrupting their current products, together, I might add - to become the world leader when it comes to cloud IoT data @ edge, and providing a connected platform for moving systems. Note moving systems. EVs are just the niche market where this starts. I\u2019m almost certain Amazon wants this product for their inevitable movement into last mile delivery with autonomous systems (cars, drones, etc). Their missing piece was embedded hardware and endpoint security - 2 things BB has the biggest moat in. Its too bad Christensen wont get to see the potential of \u2018would be\u2019 Enterprise incumbents mastering his ethos. If they can pull this off, it will be a defining moment, and case study taught in schools.\n\n4. Im also very bullish on players like NET overtaking AWS when it comes to cloud services. I think this team has realized how competitive the space has gotten, and the investments they made into IaaS were pivotal for the movement to cloud, but are now anchors as the world moves into cloud @ edge. This play with BB can give them new life, and a new rev stream to offset potential losses/investment required over the next 10 years to keep AWS competitive in the market.\n\n5. With any new market, there is always intangible risk. To me, this almost looks too good to be true. I cant see how this team can\u2019t pull it off. This endeavour pretty much rests on the ability for developers to adopt the ecosystem and build on the platform \u2014 otherwise it will be just another \u2018would-be\u2019 platform play with no interest from devs. Both amazon and bb aren\u2019t great at creating developer first ecosystems, which in my mind is their biggest risk factor. Once this is addressed, we can start celebrating.  \n\nTl;Dr: i am very bullish here, and only getting more excited. If these two can pull this off, it is going to be an event for the record books.

This is a real solid play with very limited downside, and unlimited upside.\n\nDD: I believe $INTC (Intel) will be the greatest value play in this year.\n\nKey points:\n\n* Extremely undervalued P/E ratio of only 12.37x\n* Industry competitors P/E ratio AMD: 40.88x\n* Industry competitor 2 P/E ratio NVDA:  79.67x\n* Fair evaluation of P/E means to match AMD's PE ratio INTC should be sitting around $200/share.\n* Although Intel has missed its progression on nm competition vs AMD and NVDA, Intel is entering the GPU market and also remains one of the largest market caps in the industry.\n* Biden recently formally requested a supply chain review to become more independent from Chinese suppliers for the semiconductor industry, which both AMD and NVDA heavily rely on, but INTC is producing everything in house.\n\nCurrent assessment of INTC is all bearish, which means you can get the stock at a heavy discount. INTC won't stay behind forever as nm tech progression isn't linear, it becomes harder and harder to progress to the next nm phase, and INTC owning its own supply chain is a significant industry advantage.\nAlthough AMD and NVDA is currently ahead in the nm processes, they do not own their own proprietary chips or processes, while INTC does. This puts INTC at a huge strategic advantage to boost up the US supply chain for chip supply, in the future for both CPU AND GPU. NOT just CPU. If INTC becomes fairly valued at industry PE ratios of their competitors of even just AMD, then fair value INTC stock price should hit near $200 per share levels. Currently INTC sits at around ~$60/share. Intel entering the GPU market will add significant value for the stock in addition to its strong internal supply chain in the US.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardsegal/2021/02/24/bidens-supply-chain-executive-order-should-remind-all-business-leaders-to-be-prepared-for-a-crisis/\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/biden-signs-executive-order-to-address-chip-shortage-through-a-supply-chain-review.html\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/giant-fund-bought-ev-stocks-nio-tesla-intel-sold-ge-51613755670\n\n\nPositions Disclosure:\nI currently hold 300 shares of $INTC and 4C $100 strike EXP 1/21/22\n\n\nDisclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

I can't really speak to the stock, but as someone who follows tech from a tech standpoint because I'm a computer nerd, Intel is not in good shape.\n\n1) Intel was suffering from capacity issues long before the global chip shortage started, they've been failing to deliver to OEMs for most of all of last year, if not longer.\n\n2) They are way, way behind on process compared to AMD, and then, you have the Apple M1 on Arm that's totally changing the computing game, especially for laptops.  Apple get's 1st priority fab space from TSMC, and are hogging up all the 5nm process fabs at the moment, AMD is in line, but even on TSMC's 7nm is knocking the crap out of Intel, especially when considering performance per watt, which is critical for laptops and servers.  Nobody cares about PCs anymore.\n\n3) Intel's GPUs look like hot garbage so far, kind of like how their integrated graphics have been for years.  These are probably going to end up being low-spec SI cards.\n\nThat all being said, Intel does have one, very strong point.  And that's it owns it's own fabs, and most of them are in the US, so even if they are behind on process, can't compete on performance per watt, or on price, they still can at least produce functioning silicon, and for the short term, that will be enough to keep them going.  But if TSMC can get their additional fab space online and running, and this chip shortage is resolved, Intel is going to be in a rough spot as their 7nm process has also been delayed, and looks like another 10nm boondoggle. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat does this mean for stonks?

Intel has had massive problems with EUV yields and have struggled to get 10nm working and in production, as as of right now, their mobile lineup is a mix of 10 and 14nm products, the high performance (high power) products being 14nm.\n\nI mean, IBM showed a proof of concept 1nm node, but they don't even produce silicon, there's a wide gulf between design and delivery, and Intel hasn't proven it can deliver \"anything\" past 14nm.  Intel was supposed to be delivering 10nm server chips like, 4 years ago, and they still don't exist.\n\nIn the long term, we have to talk about x86 as a whole even being viable.  Moore's Law is pretty much dead, AMD has been able to respond by adding more cores, but single threaded performance from here on has been best achieved, as Apple has shown, by switching to Arm.  Amazon has invested heavily in development and deployment of Arm based servers for it's AWS business.  There's even an Arm Surface running Arm based Windows.  Arm is coming for x86, it's just a matter of when, not if.\n\nFrom that vantage point, this isn't about Intel catching up with AMD, this is about Intel and AMD not getting left in the dust by Apple, and possibly, maybe, eventually Qualcomm.  (Don't get your hopes up about Qualcomm)\n\nNow, this won't happen overnight, a switch to Arm will be a long play, but Apple has lit the torch and shown the performance and power envelope potential.  If x86 manufacturers like AMD and Intel don't respond, they'll both get left behind.\n\nx86 is Intel's baby, but it's freaking like...40 years old by now.  I haven't seen a push from Intel at all to move to Arm, and Apple couldn't even convince them to do it, so now you have Apple designing it's own silicon and it absolutely kills.\n\nNone of this matters much for 2021 really, but in the long term, grand scheme of things, I don't know what Intel is doing about the future when they're just trying to catch up to AMD and fix their fab issues.  It's tough to innovate when you can't even keep up.\n\nAlso, since stock prices are pretty untethered from reality...do fundamentals matter anymore?  This is not financial advice.  I know squat about stocks.\n\nEdit: I'm starting to sound like an Apple fanboy, but I'm not.  I dislike Apple's anti-consumer practices regarding right to repair, and I run AMD/Nvidia in my personal/work PC, which I use for work (game development)", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": ["aapl", "amzn", "ibm", "amd", "intc", "nvda"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "How can intel go to 3nm when they\u2019re asking TSM to manufacture their 5nm chips because their foundry\u2019s can\u2019t.", "score": 3, "replies": [], "tickers": ["intc"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["intc"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16109736263751984}], "tickers": ["intc", "amd"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "what OP cant see isn't there!\n\nThere's a word for this ...", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.2082003355026245}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.43260690569877625}, {"body": "From the technical perspective you are right.

Since most development is done on X86, switching servers to ARM is a slow process.
