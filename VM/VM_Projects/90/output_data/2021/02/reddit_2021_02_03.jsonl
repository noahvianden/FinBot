{"title": "A message to the Short Bus", "selftext": "THANK YOU! Like seriously thank you so fucking much for driving the share price down. Individual GME investors can double up their positions for much cheaper. The new Netflix movie will have a much more interesting plot now too.\n\nI couldn't really recommend GME to my non investing friends because at 2-300 it was overvalued. But at 90? You best believe I'm getting all the homies into the game now. Because GME could be a growth / value play at these prices. Albeit a growth/value play with a hefty premium. But I don't think my friends will mind. They like watching you squirm just as much as I do!\n\nYou hedgies should do your research before spamming the subreddit with bots and getting your shills in the media to bash the members of this community. Do you know who we are? Do you know what we do? I've been on this sub for the better part of a decade now. Our investment tool of choice is 0DTE options! We eat volatility for breakfast and shit it out by noon. We YOLO into far riskier bets than this.\n\nIn my tenure as a proud Theta Gang ambassador I've seen many a millionaire minted in these hallowed halls of ours. I've seen people iron hand (the OG \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c) calls during the Coronavirus crash, and puts during the coronavirus recovery. We have a risk tolerance your puny manipulative brains couldn't even fucking comprehend.\n\nI've seen the lads here make and lose money at rates I didn't even think were possible before joining this sub. (Shout out to u/1R0NYMAN ) You hedgies think you're hot shit because you went to an elitist school and have a lot of capital backing you up. Well I'm here to tell you, the only thing more dangerous than an enemy with unlimited resources is an enemy with nothing to lose. WSB is about the risky bets that either win big or lose big. That's what we're fucking all about. At 3-400 per share you had us in our comfort zone. At 90 per share you're basically begging us to fuck you.\n\nIt costs us exactly \u2026 (the Square Root of Jack fucking shit) to hold. It costs you millions to keep your retarded bets open. You guys are supposed to be the smartest guys in the room how'd you play into our hands so fucking easily? Like god damn this is some \"I'm going to dump my life savings into gourd futures\" levels of autism.\n\nLike you retards realize that by executing short ladders we can just eat up liquidity even faster right?  By eating up liquidity the swings up and down will be even more massive. **Individual** investors are buying in from North America, from South America, from Europe, from Asia, from Africa!  Honestly it's just a matter of time until an arctic researcher drops a few bucks in to complete the set.\n\nYou tried to pull a fast one on us but ended up shooting yourselves in the leg to do so.\n\nWe'll outlast you.\n\nThis doesn't happen for weeks? No worries  \nThis doesn't happen for months? No fucking worries  \nThis doesn't happen for years? (Thanks for saving us a bunch on taxes!) Again **NO FUCKING WORRIES**\n\nWe've cornered you. It's buy or die. (Buy *and* Die for some of you retarded fucks lmfao) Buy our shares or die to fees and your clients leaving.\n\nThe first one of you hedgie fucks that closes out your short position is going to close for the least amount of money. There are bag holders even on Wall Street. WSB is a \"community\", can you really say the same for your wall street buddies? Sure they'll help out in a pinch but they'll leave you out to dry in a heartbeat if it no longer becomes worth it. There's a reason they say \"*There are no friends on Wall Street*\".\n\nThanks for the free money. I'll be buying more shares (5 figures worth) when Schwab clears my deposit.\n\n*Disclosure: I am not a financial advisor and nothing that I say should be construed as financial advice.*\n\n*Disclosure #2: Every time I say 'we' or 'our' or 'us' it is out of convenience or shared community. All investment choices made in the subreddit are made by individuals who act of their own accord. I nor anyone else in this community has the right to 'speak' for this community as a whole. All* ***opinions*** *expressed in this post are mine and mine alone.*\n\nNot an edit just a note: Internet stickers are cool and all but I'd rather you spend that money on $GME or to just give it to charity. Covid hit a lot of people hard and they need money more than reddit does.\n\nPS: Mods give me a flair god damn it. I didn't really care when the sub was small but now that we're north of 8 million members I feel a bit left out.

If you followed CHEWY at all you know that Cohen is a world class manager and he gives me a lot of confidence in the company. If it was soley based on these factors I'd probably pay no more than $75 per share.

Gamestop has been struggling in recent years, but the change in management and a new focus on transitioning into an e-commerce platform strikes me as smart. You could argue that they took too long, and you'd be right. But there's a lot of things Gamestop has that is going for them.\n\n1. They have an amazing brand recognition. Memes about trade ins aside so many people have fond memories of picking up their first videogames there.\n2. Gaming as an industry is set to grow over the coming years\n3. Their revenue sharing partnership with Microsoft is going to make them a lot of money in the coming years\n4. CHEWY founder Ryan Cohen has experience taking on Amazon and other e-commerce giants, I have no doubt he'll be able to bring success to the Gamestop brand\n5. Short interest is ridiculously high.

I think looking around WSB, and even the rest of the world rn. Sentiment is changing. This isn't just a company people remember fondly, its a cause people believe in. Friends of mine whose eyes would glaze over when I started talking finance now light up when I talk about Gamestop. That kind of shift in attitude makes a difference. People from all over the world have a vested interest in Gamestop doing well. All this media attention is free advertising.\n\nAt the end of the day my 'fair valuation' means nothing. Because I don't set prices for stocks, and as Melvin and Citadel learned they don't either. The market is an indicator of people's faith and belief in companies.

{"title": "(GME) GameStop and Microsoft Strategic Partnership, First Step for the Acquisition?", "selftext": "There is something strange here. One missing piece of the puzzle. The company (GME) didn't talk at all on what happened in the stock market. Although large majority of [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) apes are gamers, the company preferred to stay silent. I would like to talk about it also here. (Edit: I thought it was well know, [Microsoft Official Partnership with GameStop from the official website](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/))\n\n# GameStop didn't say a word about the stock market events, why? Can it be a very tight contract for a future acquisition by Microsoft?\n\n**Their silence** is the main point here. **Why they didn't talk?** They were in the simple position to make a simple interview that was going be seen by all the world in stick and say: \"*we are looking forward to innovate. We can adapt our business bla bla new technologies and bla bla new directors*\". That's it, and that's obvious. What kind of company is not going to believe something like that?\n\nWhy in the hell GME didn't talk at all? they were surely able to say something vague and rhetorical in case they didn't really want to support us. They were also surely contacted by the press, and invited in some cool TV show. **It was their choice. They actively chose to not talk**. Maybe they thought that this is a bubble and they didn't want to make it bigger, still they were totally able to say bla bla innovation bla bla Cohen bla bla future. Or they were preparing some financial report and they were obligate by some boomer law to not talk at all. Or, maybe, they have a contract, an agreement with some other more powerful entity that is forbidding GME to talk on certain topics / under certain circumstances.\n\nLet's imagine the last one. **Let's imagine that** **GME cannot talk due to some contract boundaries**. Contract whit whom? I would say **Microsoft**. Microsoft is powerful, big, rich, and they are partners already. Better: **strategic partners**. *What if this partnership is the first step for an acquisition?*\n\nI know, anti-trust regulations can have something to say about it\n\nThat is what I see:\n\n* **Blackrock** (I love Blackrock, high growth + 2% dividends annualized? lovely), **Michael Burry** (yeah, the guy of The Big Short), and [u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/), all of them purchased a big chunk of GME. Why? did some of them hear some interesting rumour? Did they smell something that we didn't smell?\n* New CEO. **Ryan Cohen** join the board to innovate the business completely. Why? someone else suggested this? He wanted to do it by himself? Press is pushing the narrative that Cohen put one foot out of his bed one morning and said: \"*I wanna be the CEO of GameStop*\". Randomly?\n* Strategic **Partnership with Microsoft**. I don't know which one comes first, if this or Cohen, I guess some ape can check meticulously. You know how does it sound to me? It sounds like the first step to do an acquisition. Among all the solutions Microsoft chose to partener with GameStop. Ok. And if the partnership goes very well, what will happen? they will keep staying just partners?\n* The value of GME shares just skyrocketed and **GameStop didn't say anything about it.** With no reason? They decided to not support the internet riot made basically by gamers or people in target (age / income / demography / interests / lifestyle). From a Marketing perspective doesn't sound right to me. Press, journalists, social media, TVs they wanted a comment from GameStop. Everybody was screaming for the official point of view from the company, and GameStop decided to stay silent. *Usually companies pay good money to go on TV*, this time it was going to be free advertising. So why they refused free advertising (free money)? For one good reason surely. What reason can it be? Must be a good one. A contract maybe? Yeah, it can be. And with whom? a contract with a big one. A big one like Microsoft? Maybe.\n* The **average gamer** is getting older, and richer. Every guy born in the late 80s now has a job (should have one I hope). Good customer base, growing in numbers, growing in income, cannot go down = secure income for a company. ***How would you get them all (all gamers in the world) if you were Microsoft?*** Acquisition. The acquisition of a gaming company I would say can be one of the easiest, safest, fastest way available to get a big piece of this customer segment (gamers).\n\nAm I right? am I wrong?
