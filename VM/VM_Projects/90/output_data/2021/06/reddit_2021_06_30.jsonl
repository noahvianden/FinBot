{"title": "How much is ok to lose before you to turn a profit in trading?", "selftext": " Nothing. It is not ok to lose money. There are many stories of beginner traders who\u2019ve lost all their deposits and it seems widely acceptable. But I disagree. I drew down 55% of my account before I stopped and did a complete overhaul of my mental and money management paradigms. Mentally strong traders know that the power of cutting small losses is real and laying a proper foundation of rules is a way to go. The biggest reason why investors, newbies and even experts fail is because of lack of implementation, especially during the bad periods. Emotional control is difficult in those periods. And you start making mistakes doing things like selling stocks during a crash, speculating on 1\u20132 individual stocks and so on. A few losses in a row hurts you even more no matter how much money you lose leading you to further losses. Vicious circle..\n\nThere is a way to avoid it all together. If you start investing for yourself, watch yourself carefully during the first stock market crash. Do you panic or stay calm? If you stay calm, maybe you have the emotional stability needed to invest by yourself. Observe your own behaviour from an unemotional point of view once you start investing. See how you react to huge swings. Also learn to use stop losses and take profits. If you can\u2019t analyze trends and patterns yourself follow advice from pros, there are plenty apps with highly rated traders, like this qooore app for example. Once I actually began to follow my plan, I became profitable. I still make mistakes though. I try to get a better entry when I should hit a market order or I put in a limit to close a position when it is supposed to be a market order. Sometimes I'll get nervous and move a stop. It happens, but most of the time I am calm like a rock. Discipline is the only way to succeed in the long-term.", "id": "ob66iq", "created_utc": 1625085970.0, "score": 183, "upvote_ratio": 0.82, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "Hello!
