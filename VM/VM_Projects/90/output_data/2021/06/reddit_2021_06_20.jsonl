Like if the energy density isn't good enough, why even bother in the first place?\n\n2.8 kWh/L on it's own is good enough I think, but you're right that this doesn't even cover the fuel cells which is needed to extract that energy. The batteries come with that included. If you look at the Model S it's battery is around 540 kg and that's enough to supply 1000 hp to the engines in the plaid. That's 1.4 kW/kg.\n\nThe weight of the engines themselves is not that important for this comparison because both fuel cells and batteries can use the same electric engines.\n\nIn this article they say fuel cell specific power is 1.6 kW/kg.\n\n[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2019.00035/full](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2019.00035/full)\n\nThey also talk about a theoretical 8 kW/kg (because 1.6 kW/kg was probably not good enough). It's weird how Wikipedia lists 0.34 kW/kg for batteries, but it's a source from 10 years ago and 1.4 kW/kg batteries you can buy right now in a Model S Plaid. There's large scale manufacturing and it's mature technology.\n\nI don't even know if you can find 1.6 kW/kg fuel cells, they said that's \"state-of-the-art\" but can you manufacturer enough to make an airplane out of it? The fact that they don't even mention the PRICE of these technologies. Like this is for a commercial product and if you can't even get a price for your product, it's a long way away.\n\nDigging through their sources they list this website for that 1.6 kW/kg figure, but they don't show prices,  [https://www.intelligent-energy.com/our-products/](https://www.intelligent-energy.com/our-products/uavs/)\n\n[https://www.intelligent-energy.com/uploads/product\\_docs/IE-Soar\\_2.4kW\\_new.pdf](https://www.intelligent-energy.com/uploads/product_docs/IE-Soar_2.4kW_new.pdf)\n\nThis one is actually pretty decent at 8000W peak power at 4.4 kg fuel cell.\n\nHere's something that at least somewhat comparable with a price shown, [https://www.fuelcellstore.com/fuel-cell-stacks/uav-fuel-cell-stacks/g-hfcs-2kw25v-1kw-hydrogen-fuel-cell-power-generator](https://www.fuelcellstore.com/fuel-cell-stacks/uav-fuel-cell-stacks/g-hfcs-2kw25v-1kw-hydrogen-fuel-cell-power-generator)\n\n$11.5k for 2 kW (at 5.8 kg).\n\nMeanwhile doing some conversion for batteries with $100/kWh, 0.25 kWh/kg, 1.4 kW/kg it becomes $18/kW. That number is actually totally feasible even though it's a very rough estimate.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/TATTU-1800mAh-Battery-Racing-Drones/dp/B013I9SAHO/](https://www.amazon.com/TATTU-1800mAh-Battery-Racing-Drones/dp/B013I9SAHO/)\n\n11.1V, 1800 mAh, 45C rated that's 899 W and the battery costs $21 off Amazon, pretty damn close to $18/kW. That initial paper mentions 27.6 MW is the required power for current aircafts. In batteries that would cost $500,000 while for fuel cells it's $159 million. The entire aircraft is supposed to cost less than $100 million.\n\nFuel cells are just not technically ready, while batteries clearly are.

The system as a whole actually weighs quite a lot, almost comparable to batteries, and it takes up a lot of space. Then on top of that because the fool cell is far from 100% efficient, it's more like 60%, it generates tons and tons of heat.\n\nLet's say you wanted to use fool cells for a plane. Normally the engine operates at extremely high temperatures and it's basically air cooled plus some evaporation cooling in the fan blades. If you were to have electric motors the maximum temperature you're able to operate at is maybe 90 degrees C before the motors give up. If you have 95% efficient motors you might be able to cool most of it with the cold air going through the fan and some of it you can divert and use the wings as a heat sink, but if you have another 8x heating power to get rid off things just break down.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5164783596992493}, {"body": "540.0 kg is 1189.43 lbs", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.20124827325344086}], "tickers": ["amzn"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4656424820423126}, {"body": "The example shown were bike and leisure boat ( like coastal line fishing boat ).

{"title": "An update from a crazy mostly-options trader", "selftext": "This is an update to [my post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/b7qz14/ok_wsb_heres_some_gain_and_loss_porn_for_you_all/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from a couple of years ago in which I lost over $50k and then, at the time of posting, had almost made it all back.  What has happened since then?  All kinds of crazy shit.  (So it goes with options.)\n\nSimilarly to back then, I now have an impressive 1 month chart and not-so-impressive all-time chart, so I thought it was a fitting time to give an update.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/4wrwsgcnbh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5efada36b1d7ce9648acad0590a85431efbe3d8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[All-time chart](https://preview.redd.it/zmhx543rbh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8877a8cdc96cdac0e6203f5b52b57eeb18c33d6f)\n\nAfter I made my post, my account shot up to nearly +$90k.  I actually think it went over $90k, but Robinhood's all-time chart isn't very exact on the numbers.  (Side note: one thing I want to mention about these charts is that the percentages are not accurate according to my account value at the time because I have been depositing over the years... For example, when I was +$90k here, that was actually around a 200% gain at the time, not a 92% gain.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[My all-time high](https://preview.redd.it/hoqqy1ptbh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36b8115cbe938a2d0fa2ec3b66aa7812dc296e76)\n\nHow did I get so many gains?  Well, this was a long time ago, and I make hundreds of trades per year, so I will just focus on some of the highlights in this post and hopefully that'll be good enough for the mods.  My biggest gains during this time were $AMZN calls prior to the 2020 crash and $INO calls and $SPY puts during the crash.\n\nHere's a screenshot I took of one of my $AMZN positions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[AMZN gain 1\\/31\\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/q2aqy7ixbh671.jpg?width=1439&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b413b81186cca063745a7c9f6c21c6025addb1fb)\n\nHere's a $10k $INO gain:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[INO gain 3\\/3\\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/4iih5wwybh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7108da399df140c2677500a49fb5365c41ccff56)\n\nWell, I'm sure you saw that my gains didn't last, and I imagine you're thinking I lost them all during the 2020 crash.  Yes and no.  As I mentioned, I made a lot of money on SPY puts during the crash (I likely didn't screenshot these because it was a bunch of small, quick trades).  I actually only made money during the initial crash and completely dodged that bullet.  So what did happen?  Well, after the stock market rebounded significantly from the bottom, I bet heavily that it would go back down.  And well, as you know, it didn't.  So I lost all of my massive gains to $TSLA and $SPY puts after the rebound only kept going up.  I managed to find a screenshot of some of those losses:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Some SPY put losses 4\\/8\\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/q6xvm1hdch671.jpg?width=1426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db354d6bb5cea7b9dd4b081ee2abc9bf57d6da45)\n\nOnce I lost all of my gains, I just sold everything and took a break from risky trading.  You can see the chart is mostly sideways for 6 months before it plummets again.  This plummet I lost over $60k, even more than my old losses that I crawled back from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[New all-time low](https://preview.redd.it/3d30zf4vdh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2da69f1e157782c71906ab00e39a701006ccf2c3)\n\nSo how did I get those massive losses again?  Well, in late 2020/early 2021 I lost to $TSLA puts and $GME calls.  Both of these were good buys, I just sold them too soon.  My TSLA puts were bought when TSLA was over $800, but I got impatient and sold a few weeks before it would've made me money.  GME... Well, I don't want to talk about GME.  I sold just before it went crazy.  My position would have made me a millionaire.  I took a screenshot of my position before I sold because I had a feeling I would regret it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME position 12\\/9\\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/zknq2bklch671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6ac53d8bbc8970c5c322b4ae27d68ede8ea613d)\n\nI bought in on the GME squeeze thesis posted here in WSB, and I still believed in it at the time I sold.  But I had commented here that I was in on it, and I started to worry about the legality of it and decided it wasn't worth it.  What an idiotic decision.\n\nThe TSLA puts and GME calls weren't actually the majority of my losses, though.  That honor goes to my next position, $PFE calls.  This was actually another well-timed buy that went wrong because I sold too soon.   I bought PFE almost exactly at the bottom in late Feb stock-wise, but as the stock kept rising, my options kept deteriorating.  Eventually, I couldn't handle watching my options and account fall to near zero while the stock kept rising, and I gave up and sold.  Had I held on another week, I would have made all of my money back.  Another 2 weeks, and I would have had big gains.  I didn't screenshot this disaster and would have to dig through my history for details, but I feel like no one would care to have these details.  Suffice to say it was about 1,000 call options the decayed despite upward stock movement.\n\nAnd thankfully, I made back all of my losses anyway, as you can see from my all-time chart.  After all of my disasters, I decided I was done with short-term trading and was just going to invest via LEAPs in some high growth companies.  So I did some DD and bought LEAPs on companies I thought were undervalued, most notably $SPCE, $XPEV, and $WISH.  I bought these planning to hold long term and didn't expect these would rocket higher immediately after I bought them.\n\nI didn't screenshot full positions, but here are some of the trades in my history if you feel you need proof for the recent gains.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPCE buys](https://preview.redd.it/fr4u3i62dh671.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=9019221417f56ce97cb827ae25540d2c18820cd8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[SPCE sells](https://preview.redd.it/7fb30dt3dh671.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bd46e160981d9bea69e7be2199acc6fda5f5ba3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[XPEV buys](https://preview.redd.it/6vhafze8dh671.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc543ee9d002978c3ba8e75bff0c7ff682fbf5e1)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[XPEV sells](https://preview.redd.it/pco0yzy9dh671.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb209ac22850b9a5f3fab10029ca2eea2347a5a3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[WISH gains](https://preview.redd.it/doe68wjgdh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=826e8870c8389a81aa95ee2dab83ce5df38e864c)\n\n(I made more money than is shown in these screenshots; again, they're not the full positions.)\n\nI also liked someone's DD here of $CLOV, and decided to take a small position in CLOV as well.  This screenshot is just before selling, so luckily I held onto these gains:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$4.5k into $31k.  Nuts.](https://preview.redd.it/dm35dtkldh671.jpg?width=1437&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3593cc7ecb91f46b4455ff8fa8655f4ef8652d7)\n\nI closed most of these positions.  So where am I now?\n\nActually, I'm back heavily in $WISH.  Here's my current WISH position:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[WISH current position](https://preview.redd.it/g0hywmp2eh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a08b1cf153dae3812d85292e5e7b06e9045a4f4)\n\n(These screenshots are from Thursday but they're close to the same value now).  I could go into detail telling you why I like WISH so much right now, but there are plenty of DD posts to be found.  What it boils down to is that this thing is still at less than half of its IPO value, and I think it's severely oversold for a growing e-commerce site, regardless of what some people might think of the products.  You think the quality of products is too cheap to be successful, I'll just kindly point you in the direction of $DG and its chart.  Note I bought a lot of WISH shares here even though I don't usually buy shares.  The premium on WISH options is a bit high, and I'm trying to chill out a bit after my massive unexpected gains this last month.\n\nI also have smaller positions in $ACAD, $AYX, $QS, and $RUN.  I like a lot of other stocks right now, but I just have my money tied up currently.  For example, I want to start new positions in $PLTR, $OPEN, $SNOW, $F, $AEVA, and $VIEW when I get a chance.  I also want to get back in $SPCE and $XPEV if I get a dip, as well as hoping for a dip in some others like $DIS and $DDD, and a ton of other companies whose stocks are just too expensive for me at the current moment.  I also don't think you'd be wrong to be into metals, especially nickel.  Hopefully I haven't mentioned any banned tickers here.  There are a lot of multibagger opportunities out there right now, imo, assuming hyperinflation and rising interest rates + QT don't cause a massive bear market, of course.\n\nAlthough I feel like I'm decent at this, I also felt like I was decent at it before I lost $150k in 2020 and 2021 from high to low.  To be fair to myself, the measures the government and Fed took to prop up the market/economy were unprecedented when I bought those SPY puts, and most of the recent losses on TSLA and PFE were good buys but bad sells (i.e, sold too early).  But that doesn't change that I ultimately made a bad trade.  Anyway, you can ask me for options or trading advice and I'll try to answer, but honestly right now I'm still not feeling the most qualified.\n\nOne last thing, a lot of people down $50k (which was like 90% of my account at the time) or my recent $65k losses would have thrown in the towel on options completely.  I'm proof you can turn it around... I've done it twice now.  That said, I'm also proof that you can lose it all quickly in the options world.  I wouldn't advise most people to do this.  I have separate retirement funds, college funds for my children, and make a decent living with a relatively secure job.  I would be okay if I lost it all.  This is just me trying to win a ticket to early retirement.
