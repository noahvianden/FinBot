(not financial advice)**\r  \n\r  \nNo one knows if we're in a bubble or not, as shown by the comments here and on many subreddits.

It takes time to see returns and we all want to see a 100% return in a year like if we had bought in March of 2020.

Stick with your strategy or adjust your strategy and stick with it.\r  \n\r  \nThink the bubble is going to pop and the market drops 30-60%? Sell it all and wait for that drop.\r  \n\r  \nThink inflation is going to make everything drop 30-60%?

Continue investing and keep \\~20% in cash to buy dips.\r  \n\r  \nMy strategy right now is to build my savings back up and occasionally buy dips. I had a nice savings but invested a lot of it recently so I'm rebuilding that rainy day fund and letting my current investments ride. I want to replace my roof as well so saving for that.

Sure there's drops if you look at it weekly, but yearly candles are almost always green other than huge crises (2008).\r  \n\r  \nWorst case, with inflation, stocks trade \\~flat for a few years IMO. From my research, stocks certainly don't perform as well during high inflation, but they don't drop 30-60% like a bubble or crisis.

Don't invest for a quick buck trying to chase hype. Minimize you risk.  Dont buy options unless you are ready to lose the money. I still have all my positions.

Intro\n\nSome of you may already be familiar with the [part 1 of my DD done on Sunday](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nzbdz8/lev_lion_electric_the_new_king_of_the_jungle/). If you aren't I invite you to take a look to learn about the company.\n\nStock price has fallen since my DD. I did add more to my position yesterday, now with $40K+ in warrants. I believe that it's an irrational selloff and that we will continue our journey to the top.\n\nThere has been an **investor's presentation update** and some news in QC, so I'm making a second DD with all the missing info.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Little background:**\n\nI'm from Quebec, Canada. I have invested in Lion since December when the merger was announced and have been following ever single detail + news on this company. I did not sell on the pump to 35$ because I think that 50$ PT is not out of reach in a year. Sadly the market died and took down LEV with it as well for now. But good stocks will bounce back, LEV will bounce hard.\n\n**I've visited the manufacturing site in Quebec (exclusive picture proof):**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f30bxk024o571.png?width=1057&format=png&auto=webp&s=d950ae8d6ca392e90225e8706b1c04f5f470d216\n\nI also see LionC buses in Quebec very often now. It's like seeing the first few Teslas on the road.\n\nWe are still early in the adoption of the buses but it's only a matter of time before they all become EV (see part 4)\n\n**Again, personal pic taken:**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1mxwadey3o571.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=e73a3254c3204b76f7e8245f43f1fd6c287ecb99\n\n# \n\n# 2. Potential in the short term\n\n**ARVL started running yesterday** on the news that it's being **shorted with about 20% of the float** and a **big cost to borrow shares (about 130-270%, although Etrade says 120%**). This is indeed a huge borrow rate and a good short interest for such small cap and float company.\n\nWell, as mentioned already on Sunday:\n\n**Lion is also shorted for 20%+ of the Float** with a cost to borrow **also around the 130% mark** according to ORTEX and my broker.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uwpqpv7x3o571.png?width=1041&format=png&auto=webp&s=12b3b076a58ff00ce45aca29882ab89d6739eb66\n\n**Short volume has also been 30-65%** in the past few days\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/udzwxxwxdo571.png?width=1535&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4f2f18e95c6e811d76007fa838f523739160152\n\n**I'm giving you this info but I'm not here for the short interest play. All this indicates is that the price is heavily forced down because the company is being put in the same batch of the SPAC EV disaster. Current share holders are in for the long run, shares are hard to borrow because of that. Any good catalyst could make this stock fly because of that.**\n\n# 3.

Lets compare this to other EV startups:\n\n**ARVL: 13B** market cap\n\n* No revenues until 2022, still working on their prototypes for the UPS contract.\n* Good company and niche technology but valued at **almost 4x LEV** with a lot of risk ahead (their revenue projections for 2024 are insane and most likely not sustainable)\n\n**NKLA: 6.2B** market cap\n\n* Almost **2x higher than Lion** (LEV would be 33$ for the same Market cap)\n* Company was a big scam led by Trevor Milton who had to resign\n* Still trying to work on their prototypes\n\n**RIDE: 1.8B** market cap\n\n* Recently announced that they lack the funds to continue their project\n* Orderbook might have been fake\n* [CEO and CFO resigned on these news](https://www.streetinsider.com/Board+Changes/Lordstown+Motors+%28RIDE%29+CEO+and+CFO+Resign/18553949.html).\n* Again, seems like it will either be a failure or very big dilution ahead to get the $$$\n\n**CANO: 2.3B**\n\n* Merger hits and the company announces that they lost their Hyundai partnership\n* Redesigned their hole company and now being [under investigation by SEC](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-17/electric-vehicle-startup-canoo-s-ceo-discloses-sec-investigation)\n\n**RMO: 1.1B**\n\n* An other scam by management, once merger was done, they cut their 2021 guidance from 140M to 18-40M (LOL)\n* [Currently being sued for the con](https://ca.movies.yahoo.com/rmo-investor-deadline-tomorrow-hagens-133500662.html)\n\n**Most EV SPACs were a scam or failure.

He was the second in command at the auto giant starting there in 2010 and his current role was the head of their truck division. While that took place, behind the scenes at Lordstown Motors another shakeup was underway and the company dropped a bomb that CEO and founder Steve Burns would be stepping down from his position along with CFO Julio Rodriguez. Guillen was the Tesla Model S Program Director and most likely had day to day interaction with Lordstown Motors President Rich Schmidt who was in charge of production and tooling for that project.\n\nDid our partner GM persuade Guillen that this an oppertunity too good to pass up. With the Endurance trucks coming off the line in just a few months now and a shiny brand new battery plant being complete in the coming months from LG and GM partnership the time would be now to get in. His experiene with ramping up the gigafactory probably has GM salivating at his exeprtise helping to help with input on how to maximize the potential there. And you may wonder why Tesla would open for him to jump to a competitor which is reasonable but they probably want to be friendly to GM who will be helping their own supply line with the battery plant coming online.\n\nWith productiion so close, I would think that LMC fills this posistion and the timing of Guillen's departure from Tesla and Burns resigination at LMC I think there is a good chance we have some Tesla blood coming to Northeast Ohio which would send shockwaves throughout the auto world.", "id": "o1fjkq", "created_utc": 1623877633.0, "score": 54, "upvote_ratio": 0.71, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "Let me stop you right there, Jerome Guillen was not the Assistant Manager, he was the Assistant to the Manager.", "score": 28, "replies": [{"body": "Does that position come with a pay raise?", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": "I'm theory yes, but we can't tell anyone and you won't see it on your paycheck", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24891884624958038}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.28520870208740234}, {"body": "Haha!!
