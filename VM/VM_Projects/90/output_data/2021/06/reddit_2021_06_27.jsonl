If you were to buy say 3 more tech stocks, then you're totally not diversified and all of the tickers are likely to move in the same direction.  So, don't worry about diversifying IMO unless you're actually going to diversify.\n\nWith regards to your specific plan, you've acquired a lot of cash and are going to really want to commit it. This is potentially bad timing to go all in, AAPL is close to an ATH. I think you really want AAPL at low 130s and maybe more ideally in the 127 range. I would suggest you then put in a fraction now, perhaps 20% and buy about 200 shares now. Then try to get in at better prices over the next two months (be patient with it, investing is ALL about getting in at a buy price. \"You make money by buying low.\").\n\nThis I think is particularly important considering how CCs can go bad. Notably if you do a first CC and then the underlying falls. If AAPl were to go back to 129 and you bought in at 134, the only calls you'd want to write at that point are probably 131s and 132s. If that were to be exercised, you'd be at a loss. In this scenario a person needs to wait for a price recovery before continuing to write CCs, otherwise they are majorly gambling. There are plenty of other threads along the lines of \"Help, my cost basis is 140, underlying is now at 120, I sold a 130 call and it's going to be assigned, how do I avoid losing $5000?!\". So, if you write a CC when your cost basis is particularly high, it's a bad move, you need that cost basis to be lower. Therefore if you either average down, or average up, you'll be in a stronger position to be able to write CCs for the long term.\n\nSecond, consider selling CCs on a majority but not all of your shares. If AAPL surges to 150, you'll then have some shares that participate in the full profit. You can also do similar by varying where the CC strikes prices.\n\nAnother point, CC is not necessarily the best to consider as income. It's lowering your effective cost basis on the shares and you're specifying a price where you are happy selling shares. Don't sell CCs for juicy premium, sell them at a place where you are happy selling. Otherwise when it comes time to sell your shares, you'll not want to despite having entered a contract to sell shares. Keep in mind that the risk and the real money is in the shares, they are the heavy component of the position, the CC income is going to be far smaller than losses or profits on the shares.  Ergo, it's better to sell a 140 CC and profit from $500 per 100 shares on the shares and take $0.50 of income from the CC than it is to sell a 135CC for $1.50 and make $0 profit from shares. Keep this in mind.\n\nLast, given the price is elevated right now, it's a good place for doing the wheel. This way you make income while waiting for the price to drop. I'd therefore buy 200 shares now, and sell 2 puts at 132 and 2 more puts at 130. If the price comes down to 131, then start selling as many puts as you can for 128 and 129. This will let the puts make the entry for you, and perhaps keep enough cash on the side for 100 shares so if the price drops to 125 (way below the put strike prices), you can hop in and outright buy shares (or sell 124 puts maybe).\n\nBottom line, the real art is how you enter the position, and you need to enter at a favorable price for this to be a good investment. Long term I share a bullish outlook on AAPL, but I've learned that even if you invest in a great company, if the entry price is rubbish, then so is the investment.", "score": 41, "replies": [{"body": "Good point about AAPL being near ATH, although I agree that they're a good long-term hold so if your goal is long-term success with buy and hold then I'd just buy the shares and forget about them for 10 years or so.  If you want to wheel, start with CSPs and try to stay below 30 delta and if it keeps going up, you can keep doing this anyway at a higher and higher delta if you want the shares (you'll likely be assigned this way).  If you just buy the shares, especially near ATH then if it drops too much you'll have to sell CCs too many strikes out or too far out in order to not risk losing money when you get assigned, otherwise you may end up having to defend the trade and that could cost you.  You could sell a CCS at a reasonable enough OTM on the short leg and then put in a limit order or stop order or whatever it is at $1 below your short leg, so if the stock spikes then the buy will execute and your CCS becomes a CC with a call that is probably worth more, so you make $1 per contract on the short leg plus whatever the other call sells for.

That said, if the stock gaps up (e.g. overnight or something) then your order may not execute or may instead execute at a much higher price, depending on how you structure the order.
