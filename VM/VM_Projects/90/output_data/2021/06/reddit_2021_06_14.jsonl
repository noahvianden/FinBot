During his tenure, the company opened its first plant overseas in Shanghai, expanded its battery cell supply partnerships and started mass-producing the Model Y. But Tesla also struggled with quality issues, recalls and parts shortages under Guillen that significantly constrained production \u2014 the company produced zero Model S and X vehicles in the first quarter of the year before he was moved out of the role.\n\nTesla moved him into the role of president of heavy trucking in March this year, and in June Guillen left the company. The exact circumstances of his departure have not been disclosed.\n\nAccording to Ben Silverman, director of research at InsiderScore, the filings indicate that Guillen exercised options for 451,118 shares of Tesla and likely sold the underlying shares for gross proceeds of $274.1 million.\n\nAfter that, Guillen had 75,780 exercisable options left, Silverman estimates.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla has not announced the appointment of a new head of heavy trucking.\nDuring an April 2021 earnings call, CEO Elon Musk mentioned that Tesla was \"continuing development work on the Semi,\" indicating the company isn't close to mass-manufacturing its debut, heavy-duty vehicle for which Guillen was made responsible. Tesla first revealed the\u00a0Class-8 Tesla Semi\u00a0in November 2017.\u00a0\nOn the same first-quarter earnings call, Musk talked about delays in manufacturing the company's new large battery cell, the 4680, which Tesla designed and aimed to manufacture on its own, in part to power its larger vehicles, the Semi and forthcoming Cybertruck.\nMusk said in April, \"We've made quite a few cells. We're not quite yet at the point where we think the cells are reliable enough to be shipped in cars, but we're getting close to that.\" He said Tesla was still \"quite optimistic about achieving volume production of the 4680 next year.\"", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Yep he dumped soon as he left.

Sales volume isn't everything, you still need to turn a profit, AMD has needed to still keep their prices closer to cost to gain the market share, intel also has other revenue streams. Per share, Intel is profiting more than double AMD, no only that they're paying their share holders almost the entire amount AMD is profiting per share. In the past 2 years AMD has gone from $16 a share to $90 a share while Intel has remained in the $50-$65 range. AMD has been on a rocket ship because they finally after years have started making better processors than Intel, but their video cards are still not as good as nVidia. The issue is (as aforementioned) they're not making big profits because they're trying to gain market share and trust at the moment. Stock price is all speculation that it works on \"nothing will ever change, straight line from here\" and AMD will remain king, the issue is (as mentioned in previous post) Intel has fixed it's issues with manufacturing, Tallent and CEO that let AMD get ahead. The sleeping giant is on the move. IF Intel retakes the throne for best gaming processor in the next 4 quarters and holds onto it AMD will come crashing down to $16 a share and rightfully so as it never had a chance to reap the benifit of being on top and demanding higher prices. And IF Intel does not make the comeback, it is also well positioned through its business activities to still make good profits. I think Intel stock is a very reasonable price vs AMD being overpriced.
