(This is similar to the recent book that said he wanted the Model 3 made without a steering wheel).\n\nTesla has currently ZERO self driving cars on the market (legally they are level 2 even with FSD in the state of California by Tesla's own paperwork submission - this is what I am basing this description off of). Do you really think - as a mod of this thread - that if real full self driving no human involved FSD was going to come it would come in a base model sub 30k car? \n\nAt what point do you start acknowledging he just says things, things that are not realistic or obtainable for a car company that barely can make 2 models globally (3/S) and 1 model regionally (y)  in 2021 (The X refresh hasn't hit customers right? that would be a 4th model) and that the next 2 models and semi were announced \\~5 years ago and are still 2 years away at minimum.
