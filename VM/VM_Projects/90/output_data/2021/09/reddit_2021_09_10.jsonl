Blackberry will be just as big as AMC and GME!", "selftext": "**Top 3 shorted stocks are Blackberry, AMC, and GME**. A lot of APEs have invested in Blackberry during the boom in June. Some are not paying attention to it as much as GME and AMC. All three are the best stocks during the squeeze as they will go together. Same time, Blackberry is also becoming a major cybersecurity company. **They announced \"Blackberry Delivers Secure Modern Authentication for Microsoft 365.\"**  [BB 10.48 -0.25 -2.38% : BlackBerry Limited - Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-delivers-secure-modern-authentication-120000568.html)\n\nThe same article states \" BlackBerry (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) provides intelligent security software and services to enterprises and governments around the world. The company secures more than 500M endpoints including over 195M vehicles.\" They are becoming a huge cybersecurity and this stock is great in long term as well. \n\n [3 Monthly Chart Most-Shorted Stocks to Buy Today | InvestorPlace](https://investorplace.com/2021/08/3-monthly-chart-most-shorted-stocks-to-buy/) \\- Here is the article about the three most shorted stocks. Who knows, just got balls of steeling holding on!\n\nNow one last reason BB will go to the moon is it\u2019s cheaper! Options are incredibly cheap along with the stock it self.
