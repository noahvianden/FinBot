{"title": "Dallas Fed President Kaplan to retire early on Oct. 8, citing trading disclosure \u2018distraction\u2019", "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/27/dallas-fed-president-kaplan-to-retire-early-on-oct-8-citing-trading-disclosure-distraction.html\n\nDallas Federal Reserve President Robert Kaplan became the second regional central bank leader to resign Monday, saying he was stepping down early following a recent controversy over stock market trades he made. Kaplan\u2019s early retirement follows an announcement earlier in the day from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, who said he will leave as well but cited health concerns and not the issue over his investment portfolio activity. \u201cThe Federal Reserve is approaching a critical point in our economic recovery as it deliberates the future path of monetary policy. Unfortunately, the recent focus on my financial disclosure risks becoming a distraction to the Federal Reserve\u2019s execution of that vital work,\u201d Kaplan said in a statement.\n\nHis retirement takes effect Oct. 8. The resignations come a day before Fed Chair Jerome Powell is to spend two days on Capitol Hill updating legislators on the Fed\u2019s efforts to combat the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Controversy had swirled over the issue following disclosures that Kaplan in particular had been executing large-dollar trades in big-name companies such as Amazon, Apple and Delta Airlines. The Wall Street Journal first reported the trades. Subsequent to the disclosures, both Kaplan and Rosengren said they would be selling their stocks to avoid the appearance of conflict. Questions were raised because the Fed has conducted trillions of dollars in asset purchases aimed at helping markets function, and has bought corporate bonds from mega-cap companies including Apple.\n\nKaplan insisted he had done nothing wrong. \u201cDuring my tenure, I have adhered to all Federal Reserve ethical standards and policies,\u201d he said in his monthly statement. \u201cMy securities investing activities and disclosures met Bank compliance rules and standards.\u201d Still, the issue has reverberated through the Fed, with officials pledging to tighten rules so that such potential conflicts don\u2019t happen again. \u201cWe need to make changes, and we\u2019re going to do that as a consequence of this,\u201d Powell said last week. \u201cThis will be a thorough going and comprehensive review. We\u2019re going to gather all the facts and look at ways to further tighten our rules and standards.\u201d Powell vowed that changes would be made. \u201cI want to be able to look back on this years from now and know that we rose to meet this challenge and handled the situation well and that what we did made a lot of sense and protected the public\u2019s interest and the institution that we\u2019re all a part of,\u201d he said. Powell on Monday wished Kaplan well and praised his work at the Dallas Fed. \u201cHe has been a passionate and forceful public voice on a wide range of issues, including the critical value of early childhood education and literacy,\u201d the chairman said in a statement. Meredith Black, the first vice president at the Dallas Fed who herself was planning on retiring, will serve as interim head for the district until a permanent successor is chosen.", "id": "pwqgq9", "created_utc": 1632776401.0, "score": 870, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "Sounds like they were given an ultimatum.
