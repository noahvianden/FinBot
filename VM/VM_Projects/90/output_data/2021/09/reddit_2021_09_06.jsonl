I think not breaking 400mm would actually be a huge disappointment which is why everyone that's bullish on the stock and has made accurate predictions before thinks 400mm will get passed. \n\n\nAs for the price predictions it's mostly just a scenario where it's formed a long term base and if we do get a really big quarter after having 3 great quarters in a row there's only two things it could do if it hasn't already broken out. \n\nIt can break up or down. A stock like this won't stay flat for much longer  it's too dependent on good news or bad news but uncertainty lasts only so long. Which is what we've had. \n\nMy point is basically that it's too easy for them to beat next quarter earnings if you follow the stock and it's been in a holding pattern for so long that it will inevitably mean a leg up if it hasn't moved already. \n\nThat or they'll fail dramatically (<5% chance imo) and it will break down. But it won't just trade in this range for much longer. There will either be something that breaks the bull thesis or something that finally breaks the current bear thesis.

Even Warren fucking buffet will tell you that you can't get accurate numbers when it comes to the true likelihood that a company will do well or not. At some point whether you can crunch it down to 6.725 or 5.124 or 18.99999999 repeating everything is just an approximation for what people should expect. \n\nDo you want perfect odds of them having a bearish quarter? Try going through and seeing how many analysts are expecting a unexpectedly low quarter. It won't be many but the problem will be your data set of analysts isn't large enough to be significant and useful and you also won't have a way of controlling for equivalent quality across analysts predictions. Maybe you can get that and control for it as well like how right they've been in the past? But does their performance on other companies matter? Maybe you need to only control for how well they've predicted palantirs quarters. Could be more useful but it's going to again limit your data set a lot. Hmmm. Sounds like you have a quagmire of unreliable small sets of data and that any analyst can have seriously flawed methodologies to begin with thereby even making more of the data potentially useless. \n\nSo if you want all that crunched and are foolish enough to consider it an accurate representation of their likelihood of having a truly bearish quarterly earnings go do it. \n\nI'll be here looking at trends, performance, information released in real time, analyst expectations, economic factors, and a reasonable understanding of the companies goals and plans and giving you a goddamn nice round approximation of what I think will happen. \n\nYou want easily flawed small data set hard crunched numbers?

It's that you're using guesswork and blanket guarantees and touting them as fact, i.e. \"thank me later this is the last time it's at X price\" \"if it beats earnings it never goes below 30 again\"\n\nI would bet my left tit that you're wrong about it not going under 24/30 respectively. I hope you're right though as I'm long PLTR. However you're just throwing out random numbers and claiming you have some kind of analytical backing to them, and I see mostly opinion touted as fact.\n\nI don't give a fuck what the odds of a missed earnings is, I'm not asking you to give me an exact chance of failure. I just want you to be aware that throwing out \"sure thing\" statements and random numbers I.e. \"5% sounds right to me\" is a good way to lose credibility to the audience.\n\nI am long pltr for the record and hope you are right, I just don't like people claiming they \"know\" when they are \"guessing\".", "score": 9, "replies": [{"body": "I mean to me they're not random numbers to me but that's the difference is that you don't trust me because you don't know me (and i agree you can never believe someone else's numbers) so I'm not mad at you for saying you don't care about them I just find it silly to remove someone's credibility because they think they have a prediction about price in their head. \n\nTo be fair\n\nI respect what you're saying about losing credibility with the audience. And I think you're right about my language being too heavy. I do think though that when you have a stock that has been held down by uncertainty an overextended period  of time you always have potential for greater movements up or down which is my only real point about PLTR price is I think either before next earnings or responding to next earnings will be larger movement period. Some stocks trade in a holding pattern because nothing changed with the company. For palantir a lot will have changed about the company by next earnings and the price will only remain the same as it was in May for so long. \n\nI'm actually very confident about those predictions. That IF it holds above 26 until next earnings THEN after next earnings it won't fall back below 25 ever again without a true market crash happening and that if it doesn't significantly move before next earnings then the odds of a large leg up will be very high. This is because I've believed all year that they sandbagged their guidance and I think it's been building to this point. I also think the stock has been unnecessarily beaten up by macro conditions and inflation causing interest rate hike fears as well as retail fearing forever high SBC all leading to a scenario where the stock has been unnecessarily held down and effectively ignored 2 consecutive quarters that were really solid earnings in terms of proving the greater bullish hypothesis. I posit that with macro picture improving the stock is like a spring and at some point there's a lot of unnecessary pressure on it all year that people won't realize is gone until it's gone all at once and I think it will have a meaningful run up at that point. If it breaks down in the next week or two and goes back to mid or low 20s then the chance of a leg up after next earnings will be yet even higher. \n\nIf that turns people off then so be it but I'm willing to stand by my predictions on that. \n\n\nI agree that long term growth prospects, knowledge about the company and DD as a whole is what should matter but at the end of the day many investors especially retail investors online simply want to buy a stock and see it go up. I think if I'm buying a stock I consider valuable it's reasonable to expect that anything could happen to make it go up earlier than I planned because of surprise news or catalysts and I actually think the entire retail community as a whole is a bit PTSD on palantir and scared to even imagine it can go up anymore. \n\nPrice rarely perfectly reflects the value of a stock and there are times when it won't follow a companies true prospects whatsoever.

So how exactly will it go down significantly if they need it to keep talent?\n\nTo me the entire problem is that normally this would be a very high margin business that might justify the high valuation, but if they need to shell out $200m a quarter on stock compensation it will eat up significant amount of the profit.\n\nYou can say that the future is so good for Palantir that it still is a great investment, but I don\u2019t think you can (or should) dismiss $230m stock based compensation on $375m revenue as nothing to worry about", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "To me the thing that was noticeable and reasonable about the article was when it compared SBC to other high growth industries and companies. \n\nThat combined with the substantial difference between beginning of year and most recent quarter I think just serves as a reasonable indicator that assumptions about sbc ever being sustained at levels that occurred at the share lock up expiration is definitely far from currentlh happening and another quarter will definitely shed some much needed light. But it is evidence that saying the SBC has been high every quarter is incorrect and makes it reasonable to have a patient perspective on what they will do going forward. \n\nI think they will continue to use it but it's every bit as likely that it will be reasonable as it is the \"unreasonable\" amounts at the beginning of the year that everyone is talking about.

If you have more then a billion dollar revenue business with 75% gross margin you should make a profit unless you are investing in future growth like crazy.\nBut I don\u2019t see giving out SBC as investing in the future, it looks like the cost of doing business in software development and that makes me question if the 50b valuation is realistic.", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Ah see this is a really clean perspective and a very rare but excellent insight. This is one of the best reasons I've seen for not buying this stock or just any similar to it! \n\nThe reason I argue aggressively with some people on here is that they really seem to think it's some outright scam or almost a pump and dump but this is a great perspective. \n\nIf you argue SBC is like a normal cost of doing business and it only keeps them relevant then its essentially just holding them back at its best. I think it's certainly a fair concern you could say about many modern tech companies. I think clearly the best way to answer this concern would be to \"know\" will they actually achieve high sustained growth or will it just be \"so-so\". The best way to answer THAT question is probably to say are they actually far better (10x at least) than the competition or so uniquely in their own market that the time to enter and compete puts them just as far ahead of competition. \n\nFor me my research says yes. I do see people say \"I don't get it they just give data insights it's nothing special\" but from what I can tell that's just objectively not true and the way that they can guarantee privacy and therefore security of your data is actually one of the biggest reasons for that. I think it takes a ton of observation over time to truly see how adaptive and insightful their software is and how combining it with the ability to guarantee privacy on a level that the government trusts well beyond any company anywhere in the field speaks to how unique they are. They are working with the DoD to build the AI platform that will be the military's number one weapon. Research what any commander says about the future of warfare and everyone argues that it will be about who has the better AI. I recognize that the government skimps on things and buys cheap shitty products all the time but on this most crucial element? I doubt it severely. \n\nWhen you have the kind of understanding of machine learning, and AI that I think they do and you're used to working on a scale as large as the US military for data insights I think you develop skills in programming that others don't. They've been tackling bigger problems at scale and in real time longer than anyone else. \n\nIt's evident that they are not just a common product. There actually is plenty of evidence for this and anyone who says otherwise is somewhat lazy. \n\nNow the problem becomes, how good are they though? Because they do need to be the best to justify high valuations, high cost of doing business in the software industry and other risks etc. Because we all know that most of these high valuation horses that we're betting on won't all make it across the line and the one or two that do will be the only ones that generate significant returns equal to the risk we took for investing in them. \n\nSo you do have to look at every insight into their products that you can and do your best even if you feel under qualified to make a wise determination about the strength. \n\nAs I've said before there are other ways you can judge them. They have always had an almost mythologized reputation with young engineers in the field. It's either exceptional branding or it was earned. Or both. \n\nEventually the Financials will probably speak for themselves and we won't have to judge the product the market will. That's sort of too late for us investors though. However if we do look to the Financials they are moving in correct directions necessary for the bull hypothesis to come true. It could've already been broken this year but they've so far kept it alive. \n\nThat's why someone like me gives such high credence to the customers that sought THEM out early on. It is 100% true that they got their first commercial clients before they ever had any sales people aside from literally Karp the CEO. The caliber of early customers and the overall loyalty that they've seemed to have. They only ever lost a few commercial names and back then I think it was a lot more over PR reasons surrounding their dealings with ice and anti trump sentiment. That's actually a big deal because what you want to see is customers that are like insanely loyal insanely impressed with palantir. It's like if you remember how unbelievably loyal and obsessed people were about a company like starbucks it was a lot easier to gauge that a company has an extremely good product when customers are fanatics. \n\nPalantir seems to have pretty good indications of this. The best data I can give for this is that their average renewal of old contracts goes for a nice percentage increase. Which means not only do they retain customers at an extremely high rate but the customers value them more years after using them. \n\nSo yeah the level of the companies that sought them out from the beginning and continue to speak well of palantir. The growth they're showing which speaks to said interest. \n\nThis is a company that I guarantee if someone just continues to research long enough they'll be more impressed with what they find about their products and achievements than they will be less impressed over time. I think people come in after reading some dumb over hyped bland post, decide to briefly check them out and see nothing immediately insane decide people are idiots who get caught up in hype scams and make their mind up right there. They almost wouldn't even be wrong for doing so it's just not something that you will appreciate from only a short observation or quick look. \n\nThere's other reasons but this is my basis for why I find them intriguing enough to take a risk on even if it is substantial risk. \n\nThere seams to be reasonable evidence that they're improving their product even in the recent time frame of this year. I remember at the beginning of the year even the bulls couldn't confidently argue that there was evidence that Foundry would ever be something that could be sold to even medium size companies let alone small companies. \n\nNow they've partnered with dozens of start ups, have contracts, probably got paid in some equity as well as cash when they wanted, or just found useful investments because of working with start ups. And much bigger than any of that they've formally announced Foundry for start ups \"builders\" is available and they explicitly answered that they've been deploying it completely remotely for companies. \n\nSo yeah to me that's the ways you attempt to evaluate do they actually stand out as a product. \n\n\nThey also don't have any direct competitors it would seem despite people constantly saying they just do similar stuff to other products by people who have never seen them whatsoever. So the question also becomes can they adequately compete with their future potential customers and be a better option than in house design and that seems pretty achievable from where they currently are. \n\nThey're not a Salesforce, they're not a snowflake, they're not really any of such companies but they're worth comparing in terms of ratios for P/S or SBC because at least it's similar in terms of also being software and also being high growth tech sector.", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["ups"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7657344937324524}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.7305486798286438}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5766282677650452}, {"body": "You've made some great points here.

I'm just going to continue watching what direction this metric is going, and it's currently improving multiple quarters in a row.\n\n\n\nThis is of course reasonable. The basic thing I say to that is that I'm watching for it to either become a much smaller issue or not. Currently they've done an excellent job in reducing their concentration of large clients as percentages of revenue. And the trend has certainly been going in the right direction. \n\nI think this most recent quarter was the first time their top 10 or actually top 20 biggest clients made up less than 10% of total revenue. Just kind of an indication that this is improving. There's a lot of ways you can find this and other insights on the topic by looking at the last couple earnings. \n\nIt's not something that will likely be \"fixed\" in an incredibly short time frame. However if it does happen that would probably be because of an extremely strong quarter. It's something that I'm just watching closely on and wanting to see it always go in the correct direction and if the improvement on the matter accelerates then it will become a smaller and smaller issue. \n\nIt's easy to always point to but there's a lot of recent developments on this particular front that if successful will likely make a big impact on this. One is things like Foundry for builders and just general improvements of Palantirs distribution channels (their sales force itself and partnerships that create more sales) I think we will start to see indications of greater effects soon but I think we'll get the best idea of the impact of these recent developments when we get Q4 Results for this calender year in 2022. I think next earnings will still be useful for gauging this but I think it's not unreasonable to be patient with them on this issue as long as the needle is moving in the direction we want to see it go. \n\n\nI think another thing for me would just be maybe they add a significant number of other big clients and then it may not look like they're less reliant on big customers but significantly increasing how many they have would probably also be a substantial improvement because it would mean they're less consolidated in terms of risk. It would also just mean they are capable of having so many clients that they are just safe.\n\n\nSo I don't think size is the only metric to look at but I think it's a great one to contextualize and understand.

Also, $850.8 million spread across 3.3 years equates to approximately $258 million per year in RSU-related stock expenses. Adding up both the items presents us with a stock compensation-based expense figure of around $395.5 million per year for the next three years. This rough figure is vastly lower than $1.41 billion that Palantir registered as stock-based compensation over its last four quarters.

This is after 114,471 have been exercised in the last six months, with a weighted average exercise price of 3.29$, which given a share price of roughly 26 or so, means the total aggregate value of options exercised in the last six months alone comes out at roughly 23*110m = 2.63 Billion$. Note that this seems to be on top of the aforementioned 420 Million in Stock based compensation. The latter seems to be considered a part of operations and therefore shows up in cash from operations as well as income. The 2.6 Billion worth in options shows up under financing cash flows as \"Proceeds from the exercise of common stock options\" as 376m, the 110m times the 3.29 average excercise price.\n\nThis also shows up sperately in the equity statement where under \"additional paid in capital\" you can find both the 376,574k from \"Issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options\" as well as the 427,257 from \"Stock-based compensation\".\n\nIn total this comes to around 3 Billion from that alone in the last six months.

I'm not arrogant enough to claim I know everything to do with this and won't pretend to. Do your own DD, come up with your own conclusions, and remember the economy always goes up until it doesn't.\n\nOutside of a few select stock subreddits that I shall not name here, not many people seem to be talking about Reverse Repos and their subsequent effect on the market. Let's fix that, shall we?\n\n**What are Overnight Reverse Repos (ONRRP)?**\n\nI'm not gonna bore the shit out of y'all with a bunch of technical jargon so I shall simplify it (and note: this is a *simplification* and therefore some nuance and detail is not included, so go fuck yourself if you feel the need to be an ass about something I didn't include.)\n\nReverse Repo's are basically an agreement between the Federal Reserve (which is *not* the same thing as the Federal government) and large financial institutions (banks, hedge funds, Market Makers, your wife's boyfriend, etc.) that basically boils down to the Fed giving these institutions a \"specified security\" (usually U.S. Treasury Bonds) in exchange for cash. Now, since the government is stingy with their T-Bonds and Financial institutions might need their money back at a moment's notice, these transactions are essentially reversed at the end of the day.\n\nThe Reverse Repo Program (Or RRP for short) is \"officially\" used to tighten the money supply. (Note how I said officially, I'll come back to that later.)\n\nNow, there is another program that is sometimes mentioned, called the Repo Program, which is basically the opposite of the Reverse Repo. It is used to \"inflate\" the money supply in the economy. I will not go into much more detail on this program since I have used my remaining few brain cells to understand Reverse Repos and not much else.\n\n**Cool, but, like, why?**\n\nSo to understand why this program is essential to \"control the money supply\" (aka Decrease Inflation), you have to understand one thing about these big financial institutions.\n\n**Cash = Bad**\n\nSeems counterintuitive, right?  Well, sort of. Basically, cash in itself is bad for these businesses because of one simple reason; Inflation. Cash is considered a liability (a risk) on their balance sheets when it's just sitting there not doing anything. Does the phrase \"Use money to make money\" ring a bell? Regardless, Institutions need to have most of their money in investments in order to not lose money and any opportunities to make money.\n\nNow that we've gotten that out of the way, let's talk about what exactly these bad boys have been doing for the last year and a half.\n\n**What the Fed doin'?**\n\nHere I'm going to lay out the facts of the matter and leave the speculation as to the why's further down in the next section. So, I hope y'all like pictures.\n\nStarting in March of this year, The RRP had begun to be used after nearly a year of nothing. This began after margin requirements for banks were reinstated in March after the Fed had significantly lowered them to help the economy after the COVID crash.\n\n[RRP Market Aug '20 - Sep '21](https://preview.redd.it/0ps7veqajyl71.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=2f951259466fbd0f5eeb5b9ffe7d4a7cc4352169)\n\nIt has only increased since.\n\nNot only that, the *way* it has increased is rather unusual compared to the past. Up until around late 2018, the RRP market was used rather frequently but usually only during Quater ends. \n\n[RRP Market '13 - '21](https://preview.redd.it/w3c1nsqdjyl71.png?width=1171&format=png&auto=webp&s=097526b85b2ff45ffb9d813ec22b26e98bc20861)\n\nSo this sharp increase with seemingly no correlation with Quarter ends has led to a lot of people smelling the bullshit so to speak.\n\n**1 Trilly Baby**\n\nSince August 11th, the RRP has been above 1 Trillion and has, as of August 31st, hit a high of 1.189 Trillion. The previous high before this year was around $474 billion in 2015, right at the end of Quater 4.\n\n**Why is this happening?**\n\nThe simple answer is that we don't know. Don't pull out the pitchforks quite yet, there are a few theories as to why just no concrete reason (as of yet) since none of the big boys want to reveal their hands.\n\n**Stock Market Crash**\n\nThe Stock Market has been reaching ATH's for the last few weeks and with the eviction moratorium ending, and possibly up to 11 million families at risk of losing their homes, there's a chance a crash is coming which may make 2008 look like peanuts in comparison. (MBS's anyone?)  *\"The last time this many families were behind on their mortgages was during the Great Recession.\" - CFPB*\n\nIn regards to this coming crash, it's possible that big investors are unwilling to risk putting more money into the market when they can rely on the government with their T-bonds. (Which also helps their margin requirements, so win-win for them.) I admit, this is pretty speculative and needs further research than what I'm willing to do right now.\n\n**Collateral Crisis**\n\nThere is some evidence that there is an actual shortage of Treasury bills within the market (dropping yields from their highs earlier this year) which could explain the Big Boys reliance on the FED and RRP. Oh, and the money printer himself, JPOW, said this, *\u201cYou could say there is a shortage of safe short assets\u2026 there\u2019s a shortage of T-bills\u201d*. So, yeah that's mildly concerning.\n\n**Short Positions**\n\nAnother reason as to the apparent need for bonds could be risky bets made by financial institutions (\"meme\" stocks anyone?) and the inevitability of short positions bankrupting them. I seriously doubt any of the big boys have closed most of their short positions yet so this is my personal theory.\n\nThere is also a chance that it's a combination of all three, none, or something else entirely that has yet to rear its ugly head.\n\n**TL;DR PT 2**\n\nThe point is; Reverse Repo's are a signal that the market is in risky shape due to unavoidable monetary policy decisions by the Fed (brought on by COVID) and Financial Institutions taking incredibly risky bets with other peoples' money. Time will tell what exactly caused this spike in Reverse Repo's but I'd hedge your bets whichever way you can.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Positions:** GME\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**References:**  Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements: Treasury Securities Sold by the Federal Reserve in the Temporary Open Market Operations \\[RRPONTSYD\\], retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD), September 3, 2021.\n\nLewis Huxley.
