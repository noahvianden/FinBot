I think the truth is somewhere between Cathie and Rob here. \n\nDemand for Trucks and luxury/near luxury SUVs has stayed pretty much constant, and the best efforts of the auto OEMs hasn't been able to keep up with this demand, despite the industry focusing the chips they can get on these high profit vehicles. This is what Rob is referring to when he mentions that days of supply are at record lows. However, the Trucks and SUVs that are being produced (many small CUVs and Sedans have been out of production as chips aren't available) are at much lower days of supply, basically selling of the factory line. At the same time though, there are still plenty of sedans for sale (many with significantly more than 50 days of supply, hence the average). Many of these sedans still have OEM discounts (the \"clearance\" Rob mentions) despite the fact that many of these sedans have been out of production for months out of the last year waiting for chips. Even less desirable trucks are still easily available, the Nissan titan has 100 days of supply and steep discounts. I believe this indicates that while there might be a demand for some new trucks and high end SUVs, there isn't a broad demand for vehicles across the market. \n\nCorroborating this, used car prices (still high vs where they were 2 years ago) have been falling since June, despite the number of used vehicles available for sale continuing to decrease. \n\nA recent study have shown that 40% of the consumer base says they are at least considering an EV for their next vehicle purchase... if 25% of these consumers (10% of the buying public) have firmly made the decision that their next vehicle will be an EV, then that could fully account for the YoY drop we saw in August. \n\nConsider that the demographics of this 40% (younger, less wealthy, better educated) is directly opposite the demographics of the pickup truck market. Then consider the markets hyperfocus on selling in demand trucks right now, the excess inventory in non-trucks, and the fact that the SAAR still fell significantly... I think that it is totally possible that the truck market is seeing high demand while at the same time Cathie is correct, a growing segment of the consumer base has already pivoted away from ICE.", "score": 19, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5580645799636841}, {"body": "I started paying attention to dealerships as I drive by.

Citing sources familiar with the meeting, Electrek reported Thursday that Musk held a company-wide call and said the Cybertruck should be ready for production in late 2022.\n\nIf the company plans for beta trucks later this year, that leaves nowhere near enough time to start actual production in late 2021.\n\nFollowing his comments, Tesla updated the Cybertruck's reservation page to note production will fire up in 2022. Though, according to Musk, we're not looking at early 2022 or anything like that. And as we suspected, the CEO underscored the electric truck's volume models may not be ready until sometime in 2023. If Tesla follows this timeline, we'll get the priciest tri-motor model in 2022, then the dual- and single-motor trucks in 2023.\n\nLink: [https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-production-delay-elon-musk/](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-cybertruck-pickup-production-delay-elon-musk/)\n\nElon Musk confirmed that Tesla has delayed the new Roadster program to 2023, and even then, that\u2019s only going to happen with a big \u201cif.\u201d  \nThe new electric hypercar is now three years behind its original timeline.  \nWhen first unveiling the next-generation Tesla Roadster in 2017, Musk said that it will come to market in 2020.\n\nTesla started taking reservations for the impressive electric supercar with a 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds and over 600 miles of range at the unveiling event.  \nPeople who wanted to be first in line to get the vehicle had to put down between $50,000 and $250,000 in deposits.  \nThe vehicle program was later delayed, as the CEO said that it wasn\u2019t a priority for Tesla.\n\nLink: [https://electrek.co/2021/09/01/tesla-delays-new-roadster-2023/](https://electrek.co/2021/09/01/tesla-delays-new-roadster-2023/)", "id": "phisnq", "created_utc": 1630721231.0, "score": 126, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|13|**First Seen In WSB**|3 months ago\n**Total Comments**|129|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 months|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20*h26cq3k*)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1371878683567047}, {"body": "Good, he\u2019s prioritizing the development of my robowaifu", "score": 101, "replies": [{"body": "She will love you long time.", "score": 25, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.12103235721588135}, {"body": "I can dress in spandex if that's what you like", "score": 7, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.08242636173963547}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3268013298511505}, {"body": "Let\u2019s announce a car with mind blowing specs then keep delaying it as time passes to wait until the technology promised is more achievable within our ability!", "score": 125, "replies": [{"body": "This is the way to a $600 billion market cap. \n\nToo bad F and GM can't figure this out as I wouldn't mind 10x my investments in them.", "score": 60, "replies": [{"body": "I think a part of it has to do with the price hike and lack of cpus.
