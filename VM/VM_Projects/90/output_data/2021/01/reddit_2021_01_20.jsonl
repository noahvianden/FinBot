The Semi is awesome but I feel the need to clear up a lot of misinformation that is making Tesla look bad.", "selftext": "Huge fan of Elon and the Tesla Semi, but I really need to clear up a lot of incorrect information that is making Tesla look terrible in the trucking industry right now. Its really important that everyone have accurate information, or otherwise it could really harm the company and stock. \n\nThe Semi is NOT meant to replace truckers or put trucking companies out of business, and it is not capable of doing so anyways. It is a tool to assist trucking companies, not to put them out of business. This is extremely important to clarify, because if massive trucking companies wrongly believe that Tesla is going to put them out of business, they will fight Tesla... and they are an 800+ BILLION per year industry with millions of voters. That is not something you want to have attacking Tesla for no reason because of internet rumors. \n\nHere is what you need to know about the Semi:\n\nA) It is not a long distance truck and cannot be used as such. It is meant specifically for regional freight, such as warehouse and store deliveries, and the extremely lucrative LTL freight market. It will take nearly a decade before it can even begin to operate long distance due to the massive infrastructure required. \n\nB) It is meant for a market call \"LTL trucking\", which is about half the entire industry. LTL regional trucking companies dominate the list of top trucking companies. So Tesla still has a massive market to saturate even without long distance capability. \n\nC) **Almost NONE of the customers could use the autonomous driving or convoy features, since the trucks require on site customer service and hand unloading, and the drivers also work alone.** The only autopilot feature they could use would be the accident avoidance. Tesla will also have to create an entirely new GPS program because they cannot use the car GPS. \n\nD) They cannot haul fully loaded long distance trailers due to their weight. This limits them to local freight only, which haul smaller trailers and lighter loads. But on the positive side, because they will be limited to lighter local loads, their range will exceed advertised ranges. \n\nSo, as you can see, almost everything that is being said online is incorrect. And its really important that everyone has the correct information so that Tesla doesn't end up looking like Nikola and getting smeared all over the media.", "id": "l0zpgd", "created_utc": 1611110065.0, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.78, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "Could you explain this part of C for me?\n\n>Tesla will also have to create an entirely new GPS program because they cannot use the car GPS. \n\nAre you saying there are legal reasons (union reasons? some other reason?) that truck drivers are not *allowed* to use GPS systems that are built into the vehicles?

It is intended as a competitor to rail. Thinking in those terms having multiple trucks and 1 driver in the lead vehicle going from a major hub to another major hub along a well known route makes a lot more sense and negates a lot of your concerns and points.\n\nThe driver can respond to unexpected issues on the route including route changes, they can do the inspections on all of the trucks at the start of the route, they can sign off on loads, they can respond to weather changes.\n\nI don't think anyone is talking about zero driver fully autonomous truck fleets like they talk about robotaxis. At least at this point Tesla and Elon have been very clear they intend to keep the driver in charge. Even in a multi truck convoy there would be at least one driver in the lead vehicle monitoring everything.\n\nAs for the infrastructure it becomes much easier when you break this into 2 problems. The first is the local distribution problem where you install chargers in the distribution centers and the parking lots that the trucks are stored in when they are inactive, whether that is overnight or between shifts or whenever. In this case trucks may not even use a full charge over the full work day so you don't even need super high power charging, just enough to not run out during the day and recharge overnight. That is a pretty easy problem to solve (with some fairly minor investment) and you seem to agree. The second problem is long haul where the route is longer than the truck range. This is the same problem that people still bring up constantly for personal electric vehicles, yet Tesla has managed to build that out with pretty good success and is being constantly expanded. I would even argue this is an easier problem to solve than the current supercharger network because the use cases are much less varied than for personal vehicles and the long haul routes are much more predictable. Also if you can get the range longer than a driver is legally allowed to drive in a day your problems drop by a lot and the charge rate is much less of a problem. If the only limitation now is capital infrastructure investment then that is really not a problem as Tesla has consistently shown they are not afraid of investing capital for expanded capability. Additionally Elon has even said in the past that they aren't capital constrained when is comes to expansion and that was before two capital raises and large consistent positive cash flow.\n\nShould anyone expect the Tesla semi to replace 100% of the existing semi fleet? No, absolutely not, but I don't think anyone serious is doing that. Can it replace nearly all, or at least a very large percentage of the local trucking fleet? Yes, with a high probability. Can it replace a significant amount of the long haul fleet over time? Yeah, probably, but it may take a bit more time, investment, and technical advancement to really take off. Can it grow the market by eating into rail based cargo transport? Maybe, but this will take much longer to play out than the other two. Will it take over the entire market the moment it is released?

We ran this backtest using data from 2020.\n\nThe graph below shows the portfolio holdings by week (click for full-size image):\n\n[WSB Portfolio Holdings](https://preview.redd.it/smkp7dualic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=c95d1d4bbc1047a2c76b26fbfc3305143dc39d6d)\n\nTesla, Apple, AMD, Nio, and Microsoft were among the stocks that most frequently cracked the weekly top five most-mentioned tickers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Most frequently held stocks](https://preview.redd.it/87r1vy9bkic61.png?width=1119&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffe1c8a89f6f603dd000223a4a26ee69402002fa)\n\nOver the last year this simple strategy was up over 61%, with especially strong returns in the last quarter of 2020. The \"WallStreetBets Portfolio\" was more volatile than the S&P 500, but outperformed even during the downturn at the start of the year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[$WSB Performance](https://preview.redd.it/cc17jspglic61.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=df61ec8ce1fc245a93cdb5fced42271e54f20de3)\n\nTo take a look at the relationship between WallStreetBets discussion and market activity at a stock-level, I\u2019ve picked a couple stocks that were among the most popular on WSB in the last 120 days and examined them to determine if there is a correlation between WSB discussion and share price and volume.\n\n**Palantir Technologies Inc (NASDAQ: PLTR)**\n\nBig data analytics company, Palantir Technologies Inc, had its highly anticipated IPO on September 30, 2020 trading at $8.20. Shortly after, on October 14, the discussion volume of PLTR tripled to nine counts as well as achieving a 4.65% gain on the day. WSB count and share price activity continue to share a positive correlation coefficient of 0.592 as the stock reached a 52-week high of 33.05 on November 27, 2020. *\\[Note: A value of greater than 0.7 is considered a\u00a0strong correlation. Anything between 0.5 and 0.7 is a\u00a0moderate correlation, and anything less than\u00a00.4\u00a0is considered a weak or no\u00a0correlation.\\]*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Palantir Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/f8p41x1jkic61.png?width=1122&format=png&auto=webp&s=2090f0fba5f9ee39cf7f3ed21932d31d6a0e1264)\n\nWSB counts and PLTR volume for the same dates recorded a correlation coefficient of 0.803. This could indicate a large amount of individual-investor interest driving the recent valuation of Palantir which features a low proportion of institutional ownership at 14.41% (3Q20), compared to the industry average.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Palantir Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/4qiik9ekkic61.png?width=1354&format=png&auto=webp&s=074100895bb7e99da71462126ed7f972d5763948)\n\nPLTR received three downgrades from investment banks between October and December 2020 but added a price target increase to $30.00 (from $18.00) by Jeffries on January 11, 2021, well above its current price of $25.64. Risks still linger as 2Q20 to 3Q20 EBITDA losses increased by 83% to an $848.1m loss and, as of now, positive investor sentiment continues to support an uptrend.\n\n**GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME)**\n\nGameStop Corp. has experienced financial stress in recent years as the retail trends which had worked in its favor continue to decline globally. Total Liabilities climbed 12.18% to $2.26B from 2Q20 to 3Q20. Before May 5, 2020, WSB activity on GME had been dormant averaging 3.83 counts daily YTD.\n\nShortly following this, several threads on WSB began to speculate on a GME recovery due to increased gaming activity and a large existing short position of 57 million\u00a0shares at the time. WSB counts would be amplified after an investment from activist investor and founder of Chewy (NYSE: CHWY), Ryan Cohen.\n\nSince May 5, 2020, GME has rallied 755.33% and WSB discussion counts averaged 55.34 a day making a positive correlation coefficient at 0.688.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME Price vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/g8xj575nkic61.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=2b458e40d9866fbecbedc224b5679ba885463f5d)\n\nThe WSB counts and stock volume also shared a correlation coefficient of 0.628. This was exemplified on November 30, 2020, when stock volume spiked by 31.3m and discussion counts followed suit at 227 for the day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[GME Volume vs. WSB](https://preview.redd.it/3d3xn8dokic61.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=af618e9f2ea29d71d69d86dc1884a44ec42bbf24)\n\nThe mainly optimistic speculation of a GME recovery in May on WSB contrasted with most major media outlets at the time, which appeared to focus on store closures due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The rally and enthusiasm behind GME since that time was in stark contrast to many other corporations, 630 of which filed for bankruptcy in 2020 marking a 10 year high.\n\n## Summary\n\nThere is no universal method of finding actionable insights when analyzing WSB, but discussion on the forum can serve as a useful estimation of retail interest. Companies that have had exponential growth with help from forums such as WSB are more likely to become transition to an organic growth phase with more institutional investors and less volume. Keeping an eye on rising companies on WSB could help identify an opportunity that many may have overlooked.", "id": "l1cphm", "created_utc": 1611160588.0, "score": 880, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "This is a nice summary, better than the copy+paste emails we got earlier.
