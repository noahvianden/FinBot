{"title": "Something to feed your confirmation bias on Nio", "selftext": "Nio's expansion to Europe has been discussed a lot. Many expressed doubts that Europeans would buy a Chinese car given all the negative stereotypes. From 2021, Germany introduced a CO2 tax (7c per liter) and till 2025 they give 9000 Euros for purchasing a EV. My main problem with German EVs is that they have an abysmal range. VW promises something up to 220km. I drove BMW i3 and whatever they promise there, the truth is that it's around 170 km and the charging takes like 9 hours. Why the hell do I need a car with such a range? \n\nNio offers a range up to 900 km. Wow. That's something to consider. But what about the Chinese quality and as a potential German customer who got screwed over by the government's CO2 tax right on the New Year's day I decided to google what German reviews say on Nio:\n\nADAC praises Nio quality and price, specifying that 70% of materials are from renowned producers like Bosch\n\nhttps://www.adac.de/rund-ums-fahrzeug/autokatalog/marken-modelle/auto/nio-es6/\n\nAnother very positive review stating that it has some problems with being adjusted to the European standards and market but in general it's a good car for German roads and is much cheaper than a comparable Audi\n\nhttps://www.auto-motor-und-sport.de/fahrbericht/nio-es6-guenstiger-elektro-suv/\n\nAnother generally positive review. They point out that the battery is not suitable for a speed of over 120km/h which is a big problem for Germany's autobahn as 120 km/h is the annoying grandma speed here. However, other European countries have a speed limit so it might be less of a problem\n\nhttps://www.autobild.de/artikel/nio-es6-performance-2022-test-preis-deutschland-reichweite-technische-daten-elekrtro-suv-17098037.html\n\nTl;dr German reviewers praise Nio for its price, quality and driving experience. The main disadvantage is that it is not fulfilling for some Europe-specific demands. However, if Nio adapts to those requirements, it will be a recommendable car.\n\nTl;dr for retards: Nio at the European market \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "koqieb", "created_utc": 1609560777.0, "score": 55, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 87, "comments": [{"body": "TO THE MOON", "score": 20, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.10539454966783524}, {"body": "All in on $GME & $NIO shares.

However, you don\u2019t quite have to worry about your wife going off and getting a robot boyfriend anytime soon. While this may come to a surprise to Jeffery Epstein\u2019s pal Steve Hawking[who believed robots will soon take over the world](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.newsweek.com/stephen-hawking-named-epstein-unsealed-files-virginia-giuffre-ghislaine-maxwell-1521920%3famp=1)  smart people in the field have been dealing with solving the problems of making artificial intelligence work for decades. This is good news for all those that have diamond hands \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 on their Palantir shares in the coming years, because one of the founders solved one of the major problems over a decade ago and I\u2019ll tell you how.\n\n\n**The problem with Artificial Intelligence and the Palantir Solution**\n\n\nIf you aren\u2019t yet familiar with [Stephen Cohen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Cohen_(entrepreneur)) you should be. This is the ultimate autist chad that coded the first prototype of Palantir in 8 weeks. At his time at Stanford, he studied machine learning and artifical intelligence (this was way back in 2005, these beasts of nature are always 20~ years ahead of the normie media and their trends). However, as Cohen himself mentions in his talk at Stanford [\u201cThe Path to Palantir\u201d](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=g_6_kGDdjwI) he became dissapointed studying AI due to the many limitations of the field he quickly realized. Firstly, the AI is only ever as smart as the algorithms that the humans were able to develop, thus more \u201cartificial\u201d than \u201cintelligent.\u201d Secondly, while computers are able to store and calculate numbers even faster than an autist doing his math homework before his mom will let him have his tendies, and their superior skill at storing this information, computers cannot grasp numerous concepts that human\u2019s are skilled at. Most fundamentally, this is creativity and anything that is subjective. The example Cohen uses in his speech is hunger. Try explaining the feeling of hunger to someone and while you may be able to quantify it as a number between 1-10, this quantification leaves a lot out that someone that has never experienced hunger would not begin to understand. To put it simply, there are numerous factors in life that are impossible for a computer to quantify. Computers are good at factors they can quantify (numbers) but are as retarded as your average WSB bottom feeder when it comes to the qualitative (subjective). This is where Palantir comes in. Effectively, Palantir solves the quantitative issues for the human and lays it out for humans to interact with and add in qualitative analysis. Palantir is a marriage between a computer\u2019s impeccable ability to process and store numbers and data and humans impeccable ability to use creativity and view context as well as the subjective. \n\n\n**Software & Business: The Dinosaur Superstructure**\n\n\nHeres where our other founder bellwether [Peter Thiel ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel) comes in. If you haven\u2019t heard of him yet, your girlfriend probably doesn\u2019t you stay out past 8 PM, even when she\u2019s not home. Member of the paypal mafia, when hes not busy making billions with his buddies musk and bezos, he\u2019s [taking down Gawker with Hulk Hogan ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdrange/2016/06/21/peter-thiels-war-on-gawker-a-timeline/?sh=78387f3251c5)for outing his private sex life. Like how Cohenknows how computer\u2019s work, Thiel knows how businesses work. How many people here have been in an actual office building? Probably not the right crowd, I know, most of you still live in your parent\u2019s basement, but that won\u2019t matter when PLTR moons. Anyway, one of the first things youll notice is that the majority of technology used by businesses and governments are older than the average /r/teenagers poster. [According to research conducted by Kaspersky, \u201cfour in ten of very small businesses (VSB), and roughly half of small and medium-sized businesses (SMB), still rely on operating systems such as Windows XP or Windows 7 which are nearing their end of life.\u201d](https://www.itproportal.com/amp/news/businesses-still-dependent-on-outdated-software/) For some reason, I cannot find similar statistics for even larger companies that would be more likely for Palantir to be working with, but i\u2019d wager from experience and knowing the scaleability issues that come with updating to technology, especially when dealing with a bunch of boomers, that it would be even higher for large companies. However, this is great news, because our good friend Thiel has the perfect formula to grab the biggest 6000 businesses by the balls.\n\n\nEssentially, Palantir fronts the costs of installing and getting the software embedded into an operation in it\u2019s \u201cacquisition contract\u201d stage. Im not a finance frog, but from what I understand they don\u2019t actually make money from these contracts. Hence why they haven\u2019t been profitable. However, the model is like a snowball. After the acquisition contract has expired, the boomers running the operation Palantir is contracting to have finally figured out how to use the software without training wheels and it is entrenched in their companies business. A larger contract with higher margins is signed. [Further, companies of that companies competition look at what Palantir has done for that company, such as when in Q3 Palantir found 315m in unnecessary spending for an oil and gas company, slotting to save the company 1b in the coming 12 months](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2020/Palantir-Reports-Revenue-Growth-of-52-in-the-Third-Quarter-Raises-Full-Year-2020-Guidance/default.aspx) and they are forced to sign an acquisition contract, further pushing the snowball along and acting as a case study of success for Palantir. \n\n\nRemember to diamond hands and buy that dip. The markets are an unmedicated bipolar teenaged girl on her period and currently Palantir is in a downswing, but that is only a buying opportunity for the wise of us. Short term, I could see Palantir dipping as low as $20. This negative feedback loop will be broken either by a new contract, Karp interview day, another media announcement, or demo day. Eventually. I\u2019ll lose a lot of you here, if I already havent, but hold strong and don\u2019t stress the short term as long as you agree with my thesis and have done/seen enough due diligence of your own to understand the fundamentals of this company are as solid as Karp\u2019s skiing legs. Longer term, I can see this company being at 100b+ market cap being conservative. \n\n\nBest of luck and fuck \ud83c\udf08\ud83d\udc3b andrew \u201cnever right\u201d left of Citron research, morgan stanley, and credit suisse. \n\nPLTR TO THE MOON \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\n\nDisclamers: 100 shares @ 25 (my portfolio is around 22k.

{"title": "GME DD from a retard bull - The credit market, why GME gang has two daddies, omnichannel and more", "selftext": "I've been noticing some GME bears coming out of the woods so here's a DD up your butthole, don't worry, I'll use lube and I'll ease into it slowly.\n\n\"GME GONNA BE BANKRUPT HUUR DURR\" - GME bears\n\nIf GME was going bankrupt, it would've done so already during the lockdown, not in the beginning of a console cycle. Here's a brief look at the credit markets backdrop and I'll explain why GME won't go bankrupt anytime soon and is in fact very bullish for GME.\n\nI'm not gonna go into how GME improved their balance sheets and got FCF, lots of people did that already, but I'll say something in WSB terms. Printers go BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR yo. When the IG and HYG credit market went to shit back in March and April, JPOW pulled out his magnificent printers and set it to BRR mode, the end result is well functioning credit markets with spreads that are tight af. With yields in treasuries and IG being low, people are forced to look for yield in junk bonds. This is why you hear about how CCL was able to raise debt without using ships as collateral and airlines using their flyer points as collateral to raise debt. Creditors are willing to lend at laughable rates  just to get yield. Now GME doesn't need to raise more debt, it is meeting it obligations early but if it ever needs to raise capital for future growth operations, they can easily raise capital in the credit market for as long as JPOW sets the printer in BRR mode. Which we know won't change until at least 2023, I honestly think it'll be longer than that  but it doesn't matter anyways since wsb doesn't even look 6 months out ahead. Notice how we haven't had as much bankruptcies as people thought we would ?(small businesses don't count) Well that's because of our great lord and savior, JPOW\n\nSo there you have it, betting on GME bankruptcy is essentially betting against JPOW losing control of the credit market. **JPOW is in effect GME gang's daddy #1**. (iloveyoujpow)\n\n\"BUT GME HAD NEGATIVE EPS FOR SO MANY YEARS!\" - more gay GME bears\n\nYou see the problem with bears is that they are always backwards looking, no vision for the future, no hopes for anything, always depressing. For some reason they can't understand that a lot of the market participants are writing off 2020 because of the pandemic, they also can't understand GME is cyclical and moves along with the console cycle, meaning we are now in the early days of a gme pump. Their inability to look forward is in fact the number 1 reason why their wives have chad forward looking boyfriends. **Our forward looking chad is of course Ryan Cohen (Daddy #2)**, I don't even need to explain more, but GME GANG daddy #2 obviously has a vision and he is more than ready to double down on his bet, buying GME at $16 just two weeks ago. He had a few mysterious tweets recently and people are speculating that he is ready to make another move. I'm not going to join the speculation  but the fact that he bought at $16 means that is probably the floor price and I would go all in with calls if it ever dips below that.\n\n\"THEY HAVE NO VIABLE BUSINESS MODEL IN THE AGE OF ECOMMERCE\" - Gay bear and Melvin capital\n\nWe have to give credit where it's due, Melvin capital likely had significant alpha with their investment thesis. If you look at their holdings, you'll see that they are long ecommerce and short specialty retail. They saw the demise of various brick and mortar stores back around 2015 and executed on that thesis. I'd argue that the covid pandemic essentially pulled forward all the earnings growth and priced in a lot of that growth with high PE multiples. The problem with that thesis is that it is now old, ecommerce is a crowded trade and this will not be an alpha generating thesis.  The best way to generate alpha is now to invest in a new counter thesis that can outperform the crowded ecommerce thesis.\n\nOmnichannel is one of such counter thesis, it's starting to get hyped everywhere. This is why Sherman repeats that word like he's autistic, this guy probably mutters it while banging his wife but judging by his conference call, she's probably never been excited by him. Likely he doesn't know how to execute on that thesis, thank god for GME GANG DADDY RC.\n\nThat's not to say he is useless, despite all the shit we gave him. Sherman managed to close down unprofitable stores, reduced inventory and got cashflow positive during a pandemic. This is textbook shit but still very important. and despite the letters RC put out, he could be very receptive of his ideas for all we know. He has shown to be somewhat shareholder friendly through previous buybacks and he did not rule out further share buybacks. Sherman himself holds over 1million shares and has not yet sold them as far as I know. The shelf offering concerns seems to have faded for now, and it will become smaller as the stock price increases. I really just think GME management wants to use that to capitalize on any potential pumps in the stock. This will probably be re-invested anyways.\n\nSo what did GME do so far to improve its business model? So far I've seen the following\n\n1. Pivot to ecommerce and improving ecommerce sales - which has seen decent growth\n2. Diversifying sales to include more high margin items like PC accessories, PC monitors, etc ( If I speculate, there may be partnerships with certain brands\n3. Focusing on loyalty programs like power ups - I'll never understand loyalty programs but some people are retardedly loyal to stores that offer rewards. If they can offer good incentives they can achieve high conversion rates , as far as I know, GameStop is the only specialty video game retailer in north America that offers such reward programs.\n4. Store rebranding - this might be good for their goodwill, which got hammered over the years\n\nDaddy RC has more plans for GME and we can only speculate what they might be right now, but with 12% stake, he has what he needs to go full on activist on the BoD. I expect to see some departures and replacements in the reasonably near future.\n\nIf that's not enough for you, here's a few more possible catalysts for the stock that I don't see a lot of people mentioning\n\n1. A possible new Nintendo console release in \\~1-2 years\n2. Currently distressed commercial REITs = ability to negotiate lower rent = more $$$\n3. Likely return of inflation (debatable but money supply ballooned and we are seeing velocity pick up a bit) with JPOW promising to keep rates at 0% even when inflation comes back = bullish for all stocks, bears will get slaughtered\n4. OG printer Yellen manning the treasury in a month + possible dem senate = more stimmy checks = more money going into GME\n5. If sales improve and balance sheets continue improve, we might see more credit upgrades\n6. Better sales = possible dividend re-instatement , I couldn't care less about dividends but guess who's going to be paying? The shorts lol.  If Sherman had balls, he would pull an OSTK and announce a special dividend , which will actually lead to a short squeeze while wsb laughs collectively as  we get meme returns from this boomer move.\n\nI'm sure the OG GME bulls can think of more reasons, I've been in and out of GME since it was at $9 (my CC's kept on getting assigned).\n\nCurrent positions\n\n500x GME shares - ready to buy more at the dip Monday and Tuesday, going to sell a few puts\n\n15x Apr $20c \n\n10x  Jan 15 $20c YOLOs\n\nSo does this mean I think GME will squeeze to $69 by next friday? No. GME short interest has been high for years, Melvin capital isn't going to be that worried since their GME position is likely hedged and not a big part of their holdings (they're probably laughing at wsb for all the memes we put out). We will likely have a few more dips next week which I will buy. Depending on how much WSB pumps GME before ICR or console sale release (which I expect to be lackluster due to shortages), I'll either take profit or sell some ITM calls if IV's are high. Then buy the dip.\n\nTLDR:GME bankruptcy is out of the question for the next 3-5 years because of the macro and credit market, RC is putting a floor of $16 on the price (debatable but you're welcome to buy puts or short below $16). bears need to stop looking backwards and be anticipatory. GME short squeeze likely not going to happen overnight but a bit slowly as more people realize GME isn't going bankrupt and either buy in or cover their short positions.", "id": "kp7t9u", "created_utc": 1609628119.0, "score": 307, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 92, "comments": [{"body": "Wanted to add Daddy #3.

People are starting to realize that returns are starting to kill profits. Companies are shipping goods for free but also need to start offering free returns. \n\nGetting FedEx or UPS to do this isn't a free service, it cost money and their cost is only going up as everyone and their mom is getting into e-commerce. At some point the best option is to have drop off locations and GameStop surprisingly is poised for this. Given they have small footprint stores they are basically drop off hubs and customers will see this and rather shop at GameStop over Amazon. Why? Because if I wanted to return a package I can do it easily, Amazon? Wtf I gotta get a hold of customer service who will then ask I return through shipping on my money if the item is perfectly fine etc. \n\nThe company setup to transition into the next level of e-commerce needs to have stores with small retail locations all over the place.
