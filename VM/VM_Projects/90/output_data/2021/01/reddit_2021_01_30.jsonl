{"title": "What's happening is great, but don't let the media's narrative draw attention away from the Wall Street greed that ACTUALLY started this", "selftext": "TL;DR at the end for the retards who didn't pass third grade \n\nSo most of the news and social media memes about GME boils it down to being the result of an obscure meme ticker being intentionally rallied up by a group of risk-tolerant self-proclaimed retards who all collectively agreed to buy and \"screw the hedge funds\" because we were \"bored at home\" with stimulus checks or whatever fuck else these jackoffs think we did. Yeah it's funny and feels good, but it's not the whole story. After all we hype around retarded momentum stocks all the time, why didn't CHWY, NIO, TSLA, PLTR, AMD, and SPCE surge 800% in 6 days?\n\n\n#This narrative is dangerous, and lacks important context about Wall Street's manipulation, greed, and how this whole thing ACTUALLY started.\n\n\nIf this narrative is pushed and becomes believed and accepted, then Wall Street and the SEC could actually have a case for accusing retail investors and WSB of market manipulation. But in case you're new that's **not what happened**\n\n\nThis was the complete and sole result of large firms short selling at a gross rate for over a year, while simultaneously working to push down Gamestop's share price through manipulative tactics like ladder attacks and media hit pieces. They could have covered at $4 for huge gains, but it wasn't enough, They were fully intending to run Gamestop into bankruptcy during a pandemic for maximum profit.\n\n\nEventually WSB autists picked up on this and bought the stock **for good reason**, not to collectively just \"fuck the shorts\". Those good reasons include the 148% short interest, GME being undervalued at 4% their revenue, etc etc. You guys know the deal.\n\nThis info was spread through WSB as early as last July by our holy Lord &amp; Savior DVT. Hype over GME went on for months here and eventually it was enough to begin the spike. The spike grew as other firms bought in too and news went viral. And yes, other firms are buying in too. No, your friend on Facebook who just downloaded Robintard to buy 1 share at $310 isn't the biggest one \"holding the line\". Even if 25% of adult Americans owned an average GME position of $300, that *still* leaves institutional investors with ~70% of shares. Yeah we're having a HUGE impact on markets right now but don't be naive and downplay the fund's positions too.\n\nObviously what's happening is incredible, and I'm diamond holding shares &amp; options to the fucking andromeda galaxy\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nBut please try to correct the narrative where you can, and add the important context. It can make the difference between retail investors getting legal protection or being regulated out of existence.\n\nTL;DR: WSB sparked this but greedy and manipulative Wall Street short sellers were the gunpowder and don't let anyone forget.\n\n#WE LIKE THE STOCK", "id": "l8fz38", "created_utc": 1611989123.0, "score": 1920, "upvote_ratio": 0.98, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "Whats happening is amazing*", "score": 137, "replies": [{"body": "WSB will be in economics textbooks\n\nFeel like i'm in a fever dream", "score": 139, "replies": [{"body": "In textbooks.

{"title": "Can shorts actually afford to pay out a MOASS situation? Let's discuss how this actually plays out, the impact on the broader market, and some alternative plays (SPY puts?)", "selftext": "I am trying to think through this GME squeeze thing and am having a hard time wrapping my mind around how this actually plays out and we get away with a win and money in our pockets. I have not seen much discussion about this even in posts that are very knowledgeable about why this MOASS should happen.\n\nI have a full grasp of the concept, I\u2019ve been in it since November. My biggest problem though is where does our money actually come from if a serious, monster squeeze goes down?\n\nAnd, should those of us with other holdings be buying SPY puts as a hedge, or as a cheaper correlated MOASS play?\n\n**How do we get our money?**\n\nIn the situation being kicked around across the internet with people demanding 1k, 5k even saying 30k a share.. I\u2019m thinking \u201cok but who can actually pay that cold hard cash that I can then take out to buy a house?\u201d\n\nThe answer is of course the hedge funds by liquidating their positions elsewhere, using all the cash in their reserves and going bankrupt. So first off, wouldn't this cause a drop elsewhere like an immediate sector rotation as they panic sell? And maybe the situation isn\u2019t that dire and paying the squeeze is doable by these funds- but maybe someone can confirm if they actually have that sort of money?\n\nBut then the next leap is if they can\u2019t pay then the money comes from who? MMs and brokers who sold the positions? Will the same people who shut us out of the market actually pay that? And if so, where does that come from- the same place of liquidating? Or if they spend all their dry powder on this, doesn\u2019t that shake the market?\n\nBasically- wouldn\u2019t the true, ultimate MOASS crash the stock market? Am I being crazy here?\n\n**Outcomes Breakdown**\n\nThat brings me to- should we be hedging our other positions/sneakily playing the GME squeeze with puts? Here are some outcomes I've thought through:\n\n* Situation 1: I am over stating this, shorts have the money in their reserves and can take loans etc and will cover if they have to- they just don't want to. Or there is no squeeze as they wait it out and escape. Loss on puts, possible loss on GME\n* Situation 2: We are stuck at this level more or less for a few weeks or experience a TSLA-like melt up. People continue to sell other positions to move into impending squeeze, big buyers get wary of volatility and move to cash short term- small dip in SPY and GME is a slow tendie cooker.\n* Situation 3: squeeze happens soon and violently, hedges fire sale to cover, there is an immediate medium but short market dip.\n* Situation 4: hedges are bankrupted in a day or two of the MOASS and still have a ton left to cover, money has to come from elsewhere. Funds are pulled by big boys to pay out the losses. Robinhood and small brokers go bankrupt. Chaos and loss of confidence in the markets- large market dip/actual financial crisis??\n* and my least favorite, Situation 5: if it\u2019s true the MOASS would crash the market and that\u2019s why they blocked it from happening this week, won\u2019t they shut down the market before they let it happen? In this scenario, they close the market for the day, get the shorts to agree with GME management to issue millions of shares at a set rate they can afford, then tell all of us \u201cget fucked, you don\u2019t deserve to profit off a short squeeze but now you have shares in a fundamentally sound company which you said you like so you should be happy?\u201d Gme goes down to its \u201creal value,\u201d GME management gets billions to work with, maybe they give us a juicy dividend and become a gaming powerhouse, spy life goes on. Long term hold so not an absolute disaster, but ouch. Lots of anger.\n\nAs a last thought- If someone smarter than me steps in and says \u201cyes it\u2019s true, there is no way there is enough money to pay anything over $1k/share outstanding and that is totally where we are going,\u201d does that change our strategy? Because isn\u2019t it better for us all to have $1k a share in hand than an IOU for 20k/share that will never be paid by a bankrupt hedge fund and bankrupt Robinhood, and a class action suit that goes nowhere? Plus it hurts us all to crash the market for real.\n\nOpen to any discussion on this end game.\n\n**TLDR:** Would a MOASS crash the market because hedge funds and whoever else ends up responsible needs to pull money from elsewhere? And if so, should we be hedging or even buying cheap correlated plays through SPY puts? Lastly- if that is the case, we need to think about if the powers that be would let that happen, and how they would actually handle it.\n\nNot financial advice.
