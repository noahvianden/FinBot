{"title": "Simple Palantir (PLTR) Perspective", "selftext": "  Okay guys I really think Palantir has a lot of room to run over the course of the next week or so, just hear me out. Let me just start out by saying this is one opinion of a single retard on wall street bets and you should not just buy in cuz of me! Anyways here we go pigeons, on Friday 1/15/2021 Ark Invest (all hail our queen Cathie Wood) made a significant stock purchase of Palantir for the first time since initially taking a position mid-November. The Ark Invest hype train is real right now, look at other similar new investments from ARK we\u2019ve seen significant positive price action in the weeks that follows mass quantity share purchases. Last time queen Cathie bought a significant amount of shares in PLTR we saw the stock price nearly double in the coming weeks. Now before you clowns try to call me out let me be clear, this alone is not enough to double up the stock price from current levels. BUT WAIT. DID I MENTION THERE IS MORE??\n\nOn January 26th 2021, Palantir will have a major event called \u201cLive Demo Day\u201d where the company will display the efficiency of its products to the world. This could be a massive short term catalyst combined with Queen Cathie\u2019s purchase. What the hell does this tendy-lious company sell you might ask? Their products are basically Artificial Intelligence that rapidly analyzes massive quantities of data for business\u2019s in order to improve daily operations. The more the internet scales and the more data is collected by businesses, the more demand there is for data processing. As companies scale their technological forces they often cannot keep up with processing the data to make efficient business decisions, this is where Palantir comes in. Oh and did I mention Palantir has contracts with the US Army and FDA?? Government entity partnerships are very good way to get large businesses to trust your ability to analyze data efficiently! Palantir has also been processing vaccine trial data to look for patterns, this opens the door to pharmaceutical companies pursuing partnerships in the future as they observe what significance Palantir has in gathering Covid vaccine data. It also appears to become more and more common for businesses to need data processing to make better business decisions as the internet scales. So what the fuck is my point? This is a great story for investors to buy into and is exactly the kind of thing that can get the hype train going. IN MY OPINION, three very powerful words. In my opinion, Demo day is very similar to an event like Tesla battery day where significant progress in the business model is on display a provides investors of a vision of where the company is heading. And if there\u2019s anything I\u2019ve learned in 2020, vision fucking matters.\n\nThe fact the company went public through a Direct public offering rather than an initial public offering can prove to be significant, allow me to explain. Direct public offerings\u2019 tend to not get as much hype upon listings compared to Initial public offerings. Now I know you clowns reading this thinking BuT LoOk HoW mUcH tHe StOnK hAs MoOnEd AlReAdY. But consider this, look at how Snowflake, Doordash, and other various IPO\u2019s have absolutely skyrocketed on their opening trading days and they were all backed by major underwriters. Since (PLTR) was a direct public offering I personally believe the true hype is not entirely baked into this stock. Instead it has slowly been noticed and demo day is a fantastic opportunity for the world to hear Palantir\u2019s story and finally really understand the long term vision and the profitable scalability business opportunity they have. Demo day, in case you can\u2019t connect the dots, DEMO-nstrates Palantir\u2019s product lineup of artificial intelligence. Regardless of what we actually see from the products there will for sure be a lot of hype about the potential of these products.  \n\nPalantir Counter Arguments:\n\nLockup Period Expiry: The lockup period ends mid-February shortly after earnings are reported. The lockup period could go either way, but if the employees believe in the company they will hold a majority of their shares are they have first hand vision of what\u2019s unfolding for Palantir. Can\u2019t stomach the risk of the lock up period? No worries this is still a month away and there\u2019s plenty of time to get in and out of this stock before the lockup expiry even becomes a relative issue.\n\nLast ER showed significant losses: A majority of losses last earnings report were a result of direct listing regulatory fees! These fees are not recurring, they were one time fees to take the company public. Considering this is a tech company, operating costs tend to be low and generally consistent. Therefore, as revenue scales, profit margins should theoretically soar along with it over the long term.  Again, earnings are a month out so if you cannot stomach the risk of a bad earnings report you can still sell out prior to this. \n\nAll in all, my point is this. Short term catalysts could really start to push this stock upwards to new all-time highs this week into next leading up to Demo day. And for long term consideration, any dips over the next couple months could be fantastic buying opportunities. Only time will tell. Just remember I am not a financial advisor you fucking pigeon. But with that being said the risk/reward long term is quiet enticing when you look at what this company is trying to do. I hope I at least got this at the top of your watch list after writing all this crap, clearly I\u2019m bullish as fuck short term and long term. Cya on the m00n autists. \n\nSide Note : Fuck Grammar I read charts not books\n\nEDIT: \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80", "id": "kzc1pe", "created_utc": 1610908753.0, "score": 323, "upvote_ratio": 0.95, "num_comments": 97, "comments": [{"body": "Been in since the $9 and change mark.

{"title": "RBLX to the moon. IPO incoming!", "selftext": "Roblox expects direct listing on NYSE in February\n\nRoblox said earlier this week that it raised $520 million in private capital ahead of a direct listing.\n\nThe company originally planned to go public in December but delayed its debut after DoorDash and Airbnb soared more than expected out of the gates.\n\nThe company will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol \"RBLX.\"\n\nRoblox said on Friday in an updated prospectus that it plans to go public through a direct listing next month, after the online game company delayed its debut in December.\n\nEarlier this week, Roblox disclosed that it raised $520 million in a private financing round ahead of a direct listing. By taking this route to the public markets instead of a traditional IPO, Roblox is following Spotify, Slack, Palantir and Asana, sidestepping a share sale and instead allowing existing stakeholders and employees to sell stock to new investors right away.\n\nThe latest funding round, at $45 a share, valued Roblox at $29.5 billion. In the updated filing, Roblox said an independent valuation report in December placed the shares at $41.52 apiece. By raising some money before going public, Roblox was able to pad its balance sheet and preserve the ability to bring in more capital through a secondary sale later this year.\n\nUnder the direct listing, the NYSE will set a reference price for the stock the night before Roblox's debut, but no shares will be traded at that price. In the morning, the market makers will match buyers and sellers to determine the opening price and the stock will be available to the broader market under the ticker symbol \"RBLX.\"\n\nRoblox had been considering a more traditional IPO, but tabled its plans last month after DoorDash and Airbnb popped on consecutive days, leading to concern that the company risked leaving too much money on the table.\n\n\"Due to market volatility and the performance of other recent underwritten initial public offerings, we have elected to file this prospectus as an amendment to the registration statement and pursue a direct listing to permit determination of the opening public price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE by buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers,\" Roblox said in the prospectus.\n\nBecause it's not doing an IPO, Roblox no longer requires underwriters. The company said Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will stay on as financial advisers, but JPMorgan, Bank of America and RBC Capital Markets were removed from the filing.\n\nRoblox, which first released its service in 2006, is hitting the public market following a year of dramatic growth as kids, who were forced to stay home during the pandemic, spent more time playing games.\n\nRevenue in the third quarter jumped 91% from a year earlier to $242.2 million. Daily active users almost doubled in the period ended September to 36.2 million and \"hours engaged\" more than doubled to 8.7 billion.\n\nOn Roblox's app, users create an avatar that they can move between millions of different games. They're all free to play, but users buy virtual currency called Robux for advanced features or to build their character.\n\nThe games are created by outside developers, who share the revenue with Roblox. The company said in the updated filing that in the first three quarters of 2020, the platform had about 3,800 developers, who earned $215 million. That's up from a year earlier, when 2,400 developers made $72.2 million.\n\nWhile many game creators cash out into real world currency, \"some choose to reinvest their Robux into developer tools, promote their experiences through our internal ad network, or spend the Robux as any other user would,\" the company said.\n\nTLDR: dumping my life savings in this stock", "id": "kzei59", "created_utc": 1610916063.0, "score": 91, "upvote_ratio": 0.79, "num_comments": 98, "comments": [{"body": "**I am a bot.
