When dealing with options delta and theta matter the most. Deep in the money gives her a better delta maybe .7, meaning that for every dollar the stock goes up her options will go up .7. By buying a longer term option theta is lower meaning that option loses less value as time passes. Delta - theta = + value. Why not buy shares? You use less capital and still make a nice profit.

Among those 175 million legacy cars, about 5 dollars per licensing fee, that is the reason why BB stock price was so low in the past years.  \n\n2, But with the blackberry gene of safety, security and mobility, of course with the Iso 26262 and safety highest level, link is following https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications,  qnx is embedded in Qualcomm and NVIDIA with long time partnership. So blackberry consolidate ability of the communication and computing, and control the first hand data generated inside the cars.\n\n Some guys don't believe qnx as OS is working on  nvidia, please Google It.

In coming future all carmakers will be a fleet of cars, all cars would be sold near costs and carmakers will survive from the subscription fee from the carowners.
