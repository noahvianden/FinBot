{"title": "Anyone concerned about any company doing buisness in China ever since Ma disappeared?", "selftext": "Seriously surprised only a few outlets have reporting about Ma's disappearance from the public over the last couple months. But this kinda tells you that one false comment in China can pretty much do quite a bit of damage.\n\nWhich leads me to the question does the risk outweigh the rewards of doing business in china\n\nFirst the positives\n\nChina will become the largest market by 2028 no doubt. It has the largest population in the world which is still relatively untapped by foreign markets and any company looking to grow seems to be adding china into their forcasts from companies like apple, Nike, Disney etc. They also have one of the largest growing middle classes in the world which gives even more incentive for companies to do business in china.\n\nNow the Downsides.\n\nThe Chinese government is no stranger to using its power and influence to get their way. We seen this for awhile but its become more public over the recent years. With Companies like nike, activision blizzard and disney giving very muted responses to some of the governments actions pertaining to Hong Kong. We have seen CEO's having to step down as well due to this as well (Cathay Pacific). With Jack Ma's supposed disappearance from the public eye it seems yet again that the government is flexing is muscles and influence to bring business under them control.\n\nThoughts\n\nPersonally I'm starting to get concerned about investing in business in China. I was a big fan of Alibaba for years mainly due to the leadership behind the company. But ever since China pulled the ANT IPO getting concerned that anyone who tries to do business in china or creates a start up in china will have to tread lightly on a tight rope. While the potential upsides are great the downside has been presenting more predominantly over the past few years.\n\nWhat do you all think?", "id": "kq9yjd", "created_utc": 1609771191.0, "score": 108, "upvote_ratio": 0.87, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": "There's nothing to Xi here.", "score": 118, "replies": [{"body": "Lmaooo", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.15703074634075165}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16818445920944214}, {"body": "Took you till 2021 to realize China is problematic?", "score": 23, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.47064271569252014}, {"body": "I treat Chinese companies as if they have aids.

Most games are now online, ready to be played with just a touch of a button. However, I think Ryan sees an opportunity even in these troubled times for this physical retail company. \n\nBefore we even start guessing what Ryan is gonna do, we need to know what he has done that made him a billionaire.\n\nNamely, Chewy. Chewy was successful because of three things.\n\n1. He was how fragmented the pet food industry was.\n2. He was able to build an understanding relationship with Chewy's customers\n3. Top-of-the-line customer service\n\nThere are more points obviously but I know you retards all have short attention span so I'm going to keep it as short as possible. So if you look at those three points you should already be making connections with the gaming industry.\n\n1. Gaming industry is as fragmented as it could be. (Amazon,walmart, Bestbuy, target, etc. or EA play, ubisoft plus, PSN plus, etc.)\n2. The stores mentioned above are not \"gaming-oriented\" stores.\n3. Gamer specific customer service is almost non-existent or it's not really a thing.\n\nI believe Ryan saw this opportunity because it closely resembles his first company model. I'm not 100% sure what he'd do going forward but the gaming industry is booming right now because of covid and with the new consoles coming out now. This is probably the best time to snatch on this opportunity and tap into unlimited potential of gaining millions of gamers in US. \n\nI'd be excited to see a gaming platform on either computer or on consoles that unites all games under a single platform with a monthly subscription that is unbeatable compared to other services. \n\nSure it'll take months if not years but if this is the way that GameStop is going, I'd feel pretty safe with my positions.", "id": "kqe1dw", "created_utc": 1609783423.0, "score": 192, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "[deleted]", "score": 146, "replies": [{"body": "Well said", "score": 18, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18166212737560272}, {"body": "Dog food, treats, and toys are physical items that cannot be downloaded in minutes from the comfort of your own home.

It's a new year and I thought I'd share some things I learned after reading \"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\" about the trading legend Jesse Livermore that made hundreds of millions trading both bull markets and the great 1929 crash.\n\nIf you haven't read it or heard about it, I strongly recommend checking it out. If you're like most of us and can't read, check it out on Audible or check out these tips for rough summary of some of the trading gems I got out of it!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Trade with the trend. Buy in a bull market, short in a bear market.\n* It was never my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting. They say you never go broke taking profits. No, you don\u2019t. But neither do you grow rich taking a four-point profit in a bull market.\n* There is nothing new on Wall Street. What has happened in the past will happen again, and again, and again.\u00a0This is because human nature does not change\n* A man cannot be convinced against his own convictions, but he can be talked into a state of uncertainty and indecision, which is even worse, for that means that he cannot trade with confidence and comfort.\n* Don't trade when there aren't clear opportunities.\n* Trade along the path of least resistance. If after a long steady rise a stock turns and gradually begins to go down, with only occasional small rallies, it is obvious that the line of least resistance has changed from upward to downward.\n* The speculator\u2019s deadly enemies are: Ignorance, greed, fear and hope.\u00a0\n* Wait for the market to confirm the opinion before entering. Patience leads to \"the big money.\"\n* Let profits run.\n* Don't average down on a losing position. Close trades that show a loss (good trades generally show profit right away).\n* Trade with a stop, and know it before you enter.\n* Exit trades where the prospect of further profits is remote (the trend is over or waning).\n* Trade the leading stocks in each sector; trade the strongest stocks in a bull market or the weakest stocks in a bear market.\n* Don't follow too many stocks.\n* If you can\u2019t sleep at night because of your stock market position, then you have gone too far.", "id": "kqkvwj", "created_utc": 1609802782.0, "score": 163, "upvote_ratio": 0.96, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "If this guy were alive he would be the ultimate WSB god.\n\nHe turned a few bucks into 100m.\n\nHe balled hard too, he paid off the police in Manhattan who operated the traffic lights by hand to always turn the light to green when they saw his yellow Rolls Royce coming down the road.
