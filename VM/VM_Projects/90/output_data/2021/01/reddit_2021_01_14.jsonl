In other words, the odds are that the stock will not move as much as suggested by the IV.  So if we sell a put or call, we are banking on the fact that IV is overstated, and that over time options lose their value due to Theta decay.\n\nOne thing you should note, is that IV is only a snapshot in time, and doesn't tell the full story.  It is important to also look at Historical Volatility (HV).  For example, the IV of US Steel (X) doesn't seem high, but for that stock it is relatively very high.  For this, it is important to look at IV rank and IV percentile.  \n\nWhen IVR and IVP are high, we are net sellers of options.  When it is low, we are *sometimes* net buyers.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.04067259654402733}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.21154433488845825}, {"body": "Higher IV = higher priced options = more $$ in your pocket if you sell puts.\n\nDouble edged sword though, the IV is high for one reason or another on most of these stocks.
