Around november I saw some GME DD's and did my own research too. After doing so I deposited all my savings (1000$) into GME.\n\nThe recent rise has allowed me to help out my family a bit financially, doing a few nice things recently like taking them out to dinner or helping with gifts\n\nThank you so much GME gang and WSB for all of this :)\n\nBtw I have only sold a small portion of my GME stock to do this, I plan to hold the rest of it to VALHALLA  \n\n\nEdit: I love this community so much, thanks for being so kind.

They have existed for over a hundred years and have weathered every economic depression since the Panic of 1896\n\nRoll-based snacks are the future of food as we know it. There are several unique catalysts that can make Tootsie Roll a truly transformative company in the coming years.\n\nFinancials - Tootsie Roll has a fantastic balance sheet overall. It is sitting on a lot of cash and has increased its dividends for over 50 years. Future acquisitions and mergers could provide good growth prospects. Even better, there is the very real possibility that Tootsie could expand past the candy industry. Innovative technology start-ups could be bought with the over 200 million dollars that Tootsie has stowed away. Markets such as the EV sector are prime for this expansion.\n\nFuture Management - The current CEO and President is Ellen Gordon, who is 89 years old and may soon be replaced. A potential new CEO could turn things around for this company and disrupt the industry. Suppose Jack Ma ends up fleeing China in the future. Where better to end up than at $TR?
