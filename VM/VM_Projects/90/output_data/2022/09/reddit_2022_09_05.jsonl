For the last 3 years I have been building a global stock market watchlist. Here are the results. Hope you will find it useful.\n\n[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Vqi0M2H8rHEOryYH6UviuqoPcCB7Fe\\_8P95CAXaYwQ/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Vqi0M2H8rHEOryYH6UviuqoPcCB7Fe_8P95CAXaYwQ/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n**Here are a few things before you click on the link:**\n\n\u00b7 It's a huge watchlist created in Google Sheets with lots of formulas. It takes time and RAMs to load. (I am personally using 11th Gen Intel i7-11800h with 16GB of RAM with 34\u201d monitor for a better view. My browser takes few minutes to load the whole watchlist)\n\n\u00b7 You'll find there around 1600-1700 stocks from whole world sorted into 11 Stock Market Sectors.\n\n\u00b7 On the very top you'll find daily gainers (top 5) and decliners (top 5)\n\n***But that\u2019s not all.***\n\nIn addition to that, please go to the right side of the sheet where you\u2019ll be able to find several tables. Those are:\n\n1. Companies sorted by dividend yield. Top 199 companies picked from whole watchlist.\n2. Companies sorted by my SUBJECTIVE PE from lowest to highest. Top 500\n3. Companies sorted by my SUBJECTIVE PE from highest to lowest. Up to 50.\n4. Daily price changes. DECLINERS. Top 50.\n5. Daily price changes GAINERS. Top 50.\n6. Companies sorted by market capitalization. Top 30.\n7. Companies sorted by biggest stock price declines during the last 52 weeks. Top 100.\n8. Companies sorted by smallest stock price declines during the last 52 weeks. Top 100.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUpdate. 2023.08.09 \n\nWatchlist is no longer available for public use.
