The quarters for 2022 have been lower and they will not be able to repeat that one-off Q4 record high this year that they pulled off last year (because of recession).

But that does not mean I wont occasionally adjust. For example if/when we close near new yearly lows, I will likely sell 30 delta CCs rather than 50 delta in anticipation of another bounce of that level. Worst case, I'm wrong and didn't lower my cost basis as much as I could have with ATM, but my basis is still being lowered.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVice Versa as we approached the important 4300 backtest, I sold 30 delta puts in anticipation of a rejection, which happened to play out as hoped.\n\nThat's not to say one should constantly speculate on potential movements, but there is no real harm in reducing the delta for a short while if one has a particular bias, The harm I did to myself was selling NO premium for four straight weeks. I essentially jumped out of the wheel entirely. Even rolling 30 delta CC's down as we drilled would potentially have me net positive on the year.\n\n\"The thought is the accumulated premiums, particularly in a sideways or slowly grinding market will make up for it and allow you to out perform buy and hold?\"\n\nEssentially. The premiums will overwhelm the intrinsic losses one will undoubtedly absorb. Most market days are fairly uneventful. Market makers by nature estimate the expected move of the day and set options pricing accordingly. To not take advantage of this is to assume these calculations lose more than they win, which we know is not the case.\n\nWhile I am loving this higher IV environment to boost the premiums further, the strategy by nature benefits the most from a flat or down market (regardless of wether its a slow bleed or a fairly aggressive bleed like 20222) as the premium collected always lowers the cost basis. So even if I wasn't getting paid 30pts to sell a CSP, I would still be getting paid 20pts.\n\nAs for the backtests, it would be impossible as everyday expirys have only existed for a few months and the 3x weekly backtests floating around are not practical. Meaning you can only backtest a black and white strategy. While this is a fairly straightforward approach and mechanical, there are tweaks that can be made momentarily to increase your probability of profit. Rolling CC's down at 50% profit for example in a confirmed bear market. Or simply adding cheap 5 delta tail insurance on days there are known catalysts like CPI and FOMC to blunt having to eat a -4% (or worse -8% circuit breaker type) day. None of these micro adjustments can be accounted for in a pure set and forget backtest.\n\nI'll figure out the viability of this strategy in a raging bull market better when we get back to one, but that is likely years away given the macro picture and other recessionary charts. Fortunately for me, I will be way ahead by the time we finally get to a bull market so if I see that my performance is lagging, I can simply switch to 1x or 2x buy and hold and save this for when the macro picture looks bleak again.

The average multi-decade multipe for SPX is 15x. \n\nIn an age of ZIRP/TINA the multiple expands to 22-23. With rates as high as they are, you are talking about closer to 17-19x, but the overall trend is mean reversion back to 15 (or below)\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/j3PiBZm\n\nThat is hard stats from before bear market started\n\n>Here's how Morgan Stanley adjusted its base-case earnings-per-share estimates for the benchmark index: 2022: $220 (from $225 prior) 2023: $212 (from $236 prior) 2024: $226 (from $237 prior)\n\nThose estimates should continue to be adjusted lower if rates keep going higher and the fed has stated that they will. \n\nSo just do simple math\n\n\n\nYear| EPS | 15x | 18x | 22x\n---|---|----|----|----\n2022| $220 | 3300 | 3960| 4840\n2023| $212 | 3180 | 3816| 4664\n\n\nAgain, I want it to be perfectly clear that where rates are currently, MAX multiple you can have is 18-19 and AS RATES GO HIGHER THE MULTIPLE COMPRESSES. With QE you had an effective FED PUT (market won't go lower than certain number) by adding liquidity and the upside was infinite. With QT you have an effective FED CALL by decreasing liquidity in the market (market can't go higher than a certain number)\n\nWhen all else fails, just do simple math buddy\n\nI think you are playing with fire, I think you will lose bigly, I mean, you are already down 10% YTD because of your permabull status.

What\u2019s your rational for wheeling versus put writing with cash settlement?

I often will roll them down multiple times in a day to generate even more premium. If you play only short puts in a declining market you have no ability to generate more premium than the one put you sold. \n\nBut yes, if/when things aren't so bleak, or after the market capitulates (even if we don't bounce off the bottom, but just no more further major downside) then I plan to flip to mostly writing short puts and if desired maybe selling CC but at a much lower delta (instead of ATM, maybe 16 delta) so I benefit from any positive upward movements while still bringing in premium. \n\nDoes that make sense? The backtests are helpful, but also not practical and too limited in the information that can be captured.
