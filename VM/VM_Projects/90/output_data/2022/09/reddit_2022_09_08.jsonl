{"title": "Uranium Stock play- From Rocks to Riches- Why they are up So much this month- Nuclear Energy Renaissance breakout", "selftext": "My recent posts about Uranium here were received very well, so I thought I  would let people know what else is about to happen in the small Uranium stock sector and How I am playing it along with some history and very big catalysts to cover.\n\n**The Uranium Stock play is both a Day, Swing, and long term play.**\n\n**Why Uranium:**\n\nFirst off Uranium stocks are leveraged plays on the price of Uranium and can be extremely volatile both ways up and down but I would expect most here are use to that, If Uranium price runs from $39lb to $50lb =29% gain.If it cost $38 to produce 1lb Uranium  \"Profit Margin\"went from $1lb to $11/lb = 1,100%  Increase.\n\nCurrently Uranium is around $52 in the spot market and needs to be a lot higher for companies to get into production to meet the coming record uranium demand.\n\nIn the past some Uranium stocks have ran up 5,000 % to even 100,000% in a few years time. The latter Not typical but this shows how volatile these are.This happens when a Uranium stock grows  from a tiny explorer into a big producer. Example in 2003 Paladin energy a Australian Uranium stock ran up 104,000% in four years.\n\nThere was an investor named Robert Healy a construction worker in 2003 that invested around $300k in Paladin and in those four years he was worth $417 Million dollars with leverage to that $120 million dollar gain in Paladin. This is just showing what previous unicorn Uranium stock plays have done, this is not typical.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h7rdlyozipm91.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=83afee01616c995b6480b2ad8925da28d46abda6\n\n[Source- Sydney Morning Herald Jan 10th 2008](https://www.smh.com.au/business/theres-money-in-supplying-shovels-to-diggers-20080109-1l2i.html)\n\n[Paladins 2006 Annual Report .

Soon 700 Million lbs of Uranium long term contracting is coming back into the market. **OPPORTUNITY.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9umjwyedipm91.jpg?width=1373&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ddab60f1865b31b22f1ba6e9c2482299c5f51c27\n\n**Uranium Trade:**\n\nNow Uranium trades in two markets not available to most investors unless you have tens of millions of dollars to trade. So this is why there are Uranium stocks.\n\n1.primarily in Long term contracting market with major Utilities.\n\n2.Spot market which could be buying and selling from\n\n* Traders\n* producers\n* processors\n* Big fund Investors\n* utilities\n* U.S. DOE Government soon.\n\nThese markets are opaque as most long term contacting data is not public, the spot market for uranium trades a min of 100,000 lbs ,this is physical Uranium where the buyers name is put onto a barrel and stored at a facility like Converdyn. That being said there is no fiat Uranium so it is not like other commodities at all.\n\nThe nuclear fuel cycle from rocks in the ground to fuel in a reactor is very long, fragile and a big catalyst currently as there have been kinks in the cycle .\n\n**Why Uranium stocks could see massive gains soon, Many Catalysts in the works.**\n\n* Uranium added to the U.S. critical minerals list\n* Approved U.S. russian uranium enrichment ban\n* Uranium Enrichment ban from russia\n* U.S. Gov DOE buying Billions of dollars in Uranium they requested.\n* U.S. 4.3 billion dollars request from the executive branch for U.S. Uranium Enrichment approved.\n* Risk of supply disruptions, Russia and its allies are the biggest producers of Uranium.\n\nAs you can see there is a nuclear energy renaissance in the World but the U.S. has the most reactors, 92 and they are the ones that could see the biggest market share upside with Uranium production.\n\nUtilities are coming up on their long term contracting needs and they need to be replaced.\n\n[Long term Contracts running out and need to be replaced.](https://preview.redd.it/kjirnq7oqpm91.jpg?width=3380&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2fe87b843892d6773fe054543fcff99d5e2003fa)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe total future Market Share for Long term contracting uranium in the world is 700 Million lbs , this is not even accounting for future reactor builds over 300 planned, or the 100s of Small modular reactor demand. This comes at a time where Utilities need more Uranium as their  long term contracts are running out.\n\n[700 Million lbs of contracting is coming back.
