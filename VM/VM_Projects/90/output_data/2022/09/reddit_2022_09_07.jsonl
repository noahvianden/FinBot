{"title": "\u2018Extreme buyer hesitation\u2019 pushes home sellers to rent instead of sell, and builders see rentals as a hedge against a cooling housing market", "selftext": "Faced with weak demand from home buyers, home builders and sellers are increasing their focus on the rental market. And that\u2019s likely good news for renters. Home sellers are facing a tough market. The 30-year interest rate is sliding past 6%, according to Mortgage News Daily on Tuesday, compounded by recession fears, are holding buyers back. Sellers are, as a result, giving into more concessions. One builder is even offering a \u201cfree finished basement.\u201d \n\nPut off by the softer market, some sellers in the south and the west are instead putting their homes on the rental market. Rick Palacios Jr., research director at John Burns Real Estate Consulting, tweeted. Palacios Jr. said that he\u2019s seeing a surge in sellers shifting from sales to rentals in California due to a rapidly cooling housing market in California, compared to the rest of the country.  \u201cHome prices have been falling for several months now in major California markets, and sellers realize that, so they may be inclined to switch,\u201d he told MarketWatch. Some of these homeowners were hoping to flip their house, but the cooling market is holding them back, he noted. \u201cWe know that investor transactions as a percentage of all home sales in places like Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, Sacramento, San Jose, and San Francisco, are all around 20% to 30%,\u201d Palacios Jr. said.\n\nThe same trend is playing out among home builders. \u201cThere are a lot of builders that believe that the for-rent market can offer a hedge to a slowing housing market,\u201d Ali Wolf, chief economist at Zonda, told MarketWatch. \n\n\u201cThere are builders that weren\u2019t that active in the for-rent space a couple of years ago that are now working to build single-family homes for rent,\u201d she added, \u201cbecause they say we can offer the home, the location, the school district in some cases, all to a consumer without them having to worry about the down payment.\u201d Wolf said she\u2019s seeing the pivot happen where land prices are slightly cheaper, and where demand is still strong, like in Phoenix, Ariz., and parts of the south and the midwest.\n\n**Full story here-** \n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/extreme-buyer-hesitation-is-pushing-home-sellers-to-pivot-to-renting-instead-of-selling-11662488460?mod=home-page](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/extreme-buyer-hesitation-is-pushing-home-sellers-to-pivot-to-renting-instead-of-selling-11662488460?mod=home-page)", "id": "x7y5lg", "created_utc": 1662533722.0, "score": 125, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "I went to look at a 2 bedroom townhouse last year, I thought was steep asking 315, now as the market is so cool, they are only asking 415 for them\u2026\u2026housing market has not begun to cool regardless of narrative", "score": 140, "replies": [{"body": "That house will probably never sell \n\nThose clowns are going to sit on it for months before they realize the market is no longer in their favor", "score": 101, "replies": [{"body": "it really amazes me how people think they can just ask whatever they want and if they wait long enough someone will pay. \n\npeople with a brain that want to sell will adjust their ask.", "score": 15, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30377063155174255}, {"body": "Seeing this a lot in my area too.

There's a reason \"home selling season\" is typically spring through summer. Kids start school in August/Sept and that's generally when home shoppers pause and stay put. There's not really any reason home sales falling during fall/winter is big news unless you're really, really hoping for a crash. \n\nA few considerations / caveats: \n\nHome builders had a hard time getting homes completed and there's a lot of outstanding permits that are scheduled to be delivered within the next 6 months. Although it's hard to parse out if they're all going to be for sale, are custom builds/pre-contracted or designed to be rentals. So the threat of a \"market flood\" is probably overblown.  \n\nHome prices tend to be \"downwardly sticky\" and most home sellers will not sell unless they have to. A lot of people made their big move OR refinanced into a much more appealing loan when rates were in the 2.5% range. \"Tappable equity\" in homes is slightly lower than it's all time peak in May. \n\nCombining the above two points - even if new construction floods the market, there is no reason to expect existing homes to also flood the market and by controlling supply you can generally maintain price. Home owners have plenty of time to wait out a market downturn. \n\nIf you want to look at what might happen with housing you'd be much smarter looking at the late 70s/early 80s instead of 2006. During that inflationary period you saw houses maintain their nominal value but lose real dollar value. I'd expect housing prices to wobble up and down over the next few years until affordability catches up with pricing. \n\nhttps://calculatedrisk.substack.com/p/housing-dont-compare-the-current", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "The next few years?
