If you\u2019re a 6th grade math level you should learn 6th grade math until you can move on. It makes kids feel stupid to be in a class that they have no fucking clue what\u2019s going on. I would make things a lot more relevant, I wouldn\u2019t spend as much time in each class. We need to change the education to prepare the kids for life in our low income schools these kids graduate with no real world skills I would change it to you graduate you know how to cook, clean, live on your own, pay bills, buy a house and a car, career options a million things.
