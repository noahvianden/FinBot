Ford may very well be successful at shifting over to EV's (I'll get to that in a moment), but this argument misses a key point, people aren't going to start buying twice as many cars just because EV's become a thing. Ford's ICE business WILL die out. And given how EV adoption will likely follow an S curve given historic trends on the adoption of new technology, Ford's ICE business will likely die out a lot faster then may F bulls seem to be realize.\n\nConsider this fact for a moment. Global EV sales grew **38%** YoY in 2020, and **doubled** in 2021. If EV's keep up that kind of a 30%+ growth rate EV's will pass the 50% market of vehicles sales even before 2030 and ICE sales will a similar decline in sales (in the new car market at the very least) over that time period. [Link to an article with those numbers and more for those who don't believe me.](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-10-years-of-global-ev-sales-by-country/)\n\nSo bottom line, Ford and other automakers have to move FAST to switch to EV's, or else their competitors are going to cannibalize their ICE sales. But it takes a lot of time and money to shift everything over to EV's, and I think there's a strong possibility that they won't be able to move fast enough. On average it takes 3 years to bring a new vehicle to market, and I just provided examples in the prior paragraph that EV adoption is growing over 30% a year worldwide. That means that by the time F or many other automakers can bring an EV from the drawing room to the market that EV sales will likely have more than doubled in that 3 year period if we assume a 30% average annual growth rate in EV sales.\n\nIMHO, I used to think F would go bankrupt trying to transition to EV's. I'm not as certain about that lately given some of the moves of their new CEO, he seems to be taking EV's much more seriously than their prior CEO, and seems to understand the urgency of the situation.
