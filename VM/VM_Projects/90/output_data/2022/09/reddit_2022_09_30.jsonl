{"title": "9-30-22 SPY/ ES Futures, Apple and Tesla Weekly Recap and Market Analysis", "selftext": "Well lets just get this part out of the way first\u2026 here is your new JPM Collar. 2890 and 3425 Puts with 3870 Calls. Futures came within 15 dollars of hitting that 3580 price target of the collar which expired today. Does that mean SPX will see 3870+ and 3425 at some point over the next 3 months? Possibly yes\u2026 but remember this is just a protective collar this isn\u2019t their prediction. The JPM collar is amessy thing to track. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ec6qs83ic2r91.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=249ab20a7e2c2ba7081beecb9716b208e20f320b\n\nIt appears the trend of a red open and a red close is holding true now for 4 quarters in a row. Something to keep in mind for next time. \n\nThe question with what looked like a strong morning that turned weak and had a lot of weakness EOD with stocks like Apple still in a massive sell off\u2026 whats next? Is the bottom in? or did SPY just start its next leg down? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j6ty5rkic2r91.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cdb0ae8bd0693491598c0098ff7fc6f4b4f7ebf\n\nHere you can see we broke through both supports of that red diamond I was talking about. In theory that should lead to a bigger downside move. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ehc0l0jc2r91.png?width=848&format=png&auto=webp&s=2395343f4a8b93818a94826d5b64e106fa58a8bf\n\nHere is the cleaned up chart for SPY now. You can see the blue falling wedge is still entact and the black bear channel also is still intact. What I am seeing forming on the markets here and I mentioned this yesterday was that 360-370 was clear consolidation and until we see one of those levels broken we should be patient. Now that the 360 downside has not only been broken but it was closed below the favor is there to downside. However, the issue we have here is that we have been selling off non-stop for a month now. 7 of the last 8 days have been red (-8.3%),  11 of the last 14 days have been red (-11.5%), 17 of the last 25 days have been red (-15%) and finally 21 of the last 32 days have been red (-16.9%). \n\nThat is a ton of selling and this has SPY closing a daily candle below the 75% retracement (blue dotted line) of this 2022 bear channel for the first time since June. However, this still does not feel like for SPY capitulation. This is just a slow boring bleed. This isnt the -5% like we had at CPI this is just a slow bleed and the VIX is not hitting those capitulation levels. We are either starting our next leg down and next week is going to be the week the blood hits the markets with VIX closing over 40 or the bottom fell out here with quarterly options expiration and we will see a push up from here. Honestly I went into today and was bullish most of the day but now I am worried with SPY closing below the weekly 200ema for the first time since the 2020 covid crash\u2026 however, once we closed a candle below the weekly 200ema that was bottom\u2026 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9dbe1xijc2r91.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cd0f102c9617770c1d04fdc29a80e7091eb3c2a\n\nClosing a candle below the weekly 200ema and the full body being below it is very worrisome for sure. That EOD sell off on spy does have me wondering if we come out swinging bloody on Monday. However, with this weeky candle body we could see a true double bottom of 357 and push green. SPY remains in the black bear channel and has now an intense blue resistance line which forms a falling wedge. \n\nKey supports for next week- 357 -> 350.2 -> 348 -> 346 (black bear channel support) -> 342 -> 338 (green 2022 bear channel support) \n\nKey resistance for next week- 353.4 (black falling wedge resistance) -> 357 -> 366.6 (weekly 200ema) \n\nWhat I am seeing that unless SPY opens down 1.1% Monday and holds there all week for a push lower to 346 then we will open persumably taking out that blue resistance and that should provide some upward momentum. However, unless bulls can really gather momentum and take out the weekly 200ema at 366.6 then it is likely short lived upward momentum. With 6 of the last 7 weeks closing red we are on pace to test the 10 out of 11 red weeks we saw from march to june. If that is the case we truly could see 330 by end of october. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xrnswo2kc2r91.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a1496caa8a23373855e650c3020055b4bb64e06\n\nFutures also broke through its diamond pattern today and broke out of its similar consolidation from 3650 to 3730. \n\nI will be watching that blue support line closely as we have 3 touches on it so that should be something that is able to withstand a test. Current futures is doing its best to close over 3600. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/w9x2hajkc2r91.png?width=619&format=png&auto=webp&s=6450539058961e3b2aaa912d2b08390cb5261e83\n\nSimilar idea here on Futures weekly here. We are seeing that the blue falling wedge is about to come to an end next week when we open. Now mind you we could always false breakout and then drop from there but SPY and Futures patterns are pointing to upside from a technical stand point. Same thought process here is that unless we open pretty deep red (about -1.4%) on futures and hold there we will see that blue rising wedge broken. \n\nKey support- 3600 -> 3545 -> 3528 -> 3500 (black bear channel support) \n\nKey resistance- 3545 (blue falling wedge) -> 3680 (weekly 200ema) -> 3705\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fwxti11lc2r91.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=0440437f52482bb803ef5bd43c3ec624362e5515\n\nApple to me looks like this week was \u201ccapitulation\u201d I think investors finally realized tech is not safe. The one kinda impressive thing about it though is how dramatic the drop on Apple has been in comparison to SPY. So Apple dropped 10.9% or $16.72 in 4 days while SPY only fell 4.1% or $$15.26 in the same time frame. This seems like a rotation to risk off from me. As I have been mentioning for the last two week is that Tech was holding up impressively well compared to SPY that was getting beat up. \n\nThere is a chance people rotated our of non-tech stuff for the last two weeks and finally are rotating out of tech now too. They say TECH is always the last to fall\u2026 Currently Apple is only 6.5% from its 52week low. \n\nWhile this impressive sell off make me think we should see a bounce on Apple I would be very careful buying calls until we see that red resistance line broken. It attempted today and I was very convinced today it was going to bounce and that the markets were going to find support. However, it rejected hard at that 143.1 resistance and dumped impressively from there. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/568ac1ilc2r91.png?width=773&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff53620d4c9c6d9cd26ebe7e6efd7a69d74e4a6b\n\nWatching the weekly you can see we have a pretty intense blue bear channel and a lesser intense black bear channel. \n\nSupport- 138 -> 135.5 (black bear channel support) -> 133.3 -> 131.9 (blue bear channel support)\n\nResistance- 141.6 -> 145.6 -> 149.2\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ctnptuxlc2r91.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=61f44fe5fc9f382839bf10fbd823ee474688ab28\n\nIf we believe that the tech dominos are about to fall then my prediction last week when Tesla rejected 312 and I noted this blue arrow inverse head and shoulders\u2026 tesla just might actually see that 220-240 support range. Tesla is impressively still 22% off its 52 week low here. On the daily chart we saw Tesla close below 270 for the first time since July. There is a potential of a support bounce at 258.6, however, if Tesla loses that support next week I do suspect the bigger downside is coming. While comparatively tesla looked much stronger then Apple today (especially this morning) as long as Apple is selling off Tesla will get sympathy weakness. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4t9hkxdmc2r91.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=c189e139d7c09d9ecd8bfb0f15d5cf14911bc619\n\nTesla weekly closed out in a deadzone from 258.2 to 272. There is not a lot of price action here since March. However the biggest weekly takeaway is that this is the first time we have see Tesla weekly candle close below 270 since July. In addition we did have a hard rejection at that 300 level. \n\nWith that blue resistance line I will be keeping an eye on that. If Tesla is to break through that line at some point next week that would be my signal of upside to come. Until then I do suspect we may actually see further downside. Generally speaking a gravestone doji in a downtrend is seen as continuation now reversal. \n\nIf Tesla loses 258.2 I would think the sell off will be hot and heavy down. Think flash crash (most likely coupled with a Apple flash crash to 52 week low. \n\nKey support- 258.2 -> 248 (black June recovery support line) -> 244.6 -> 222.8\n\nKey resistance- 265.4 (blue resistance) -> 272.1 -> 287.9 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/us0cffxmc2r91.png?width=783&format=png&auto=webp&s=e07b217c4607bc0cbac8deaef403c9e9f6a7bdef\n\nThe VIX once again is less help then help when it comes to trading this 2022 bear market. On one hand this morning it was unwinding, broke through the daily 8ema and broke the rising wedge which accelerated this sell off before FOMC. However, by mid day the VIX said nah fam just kidding and ripped back to 33.25 before it unwound EOD. \n\nThat is where today is interesting as we have a red VIX day with a pretty large red SPY day. \n\nThe big VIX spike on September 28th to me appears to tell that the bottom is in for the time being, however, IF markets \u201cagree\u201d with the negative sentiment of the markets we COULD see the VIX unwind while markets continue to drop. \n\nOverall there are a lot of stocks hitting their 52 week lows and hitting lows that have not been seen since 2020. Overall I think we are getting closer and closer to the next bounce. In my opinion much like the May 20th to June 8th bounce I think we are due for another bounce before a bigger leg down takes place. Comparatively this is one of the bigger overall sell offs that we have seen this year next to the June CPI/ FOMC flash crash we had. \n\nI think if you were to start DCAing into a small 30-60dte call position here you would be well rewarded in time, however, I do have this eerie feeling in the back of my head that next week is going to come out blood red and we are going to see full on capitulation (think covid/ 2008 crash -20% week). However, to experience a week like that we NEED a bigger catalyst. We need that market news that hits that makes everyone go oh no. its time to sell everything and get out while I still have anything left. I don\u2019t think we are there yet there is a lot of hope in this market and world still. And lets be honest we are not the same levels we were during covid and 2008 crash. \n\nThis is one of those times where it is better NOT to swing and its better to miss 3-4% on the upside move then be early and see another 5-6% down before it bounces. SPY and markets continue to teeter on the edge of the cliff. \n\n10% Challenge- \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jkre76hnc2r91.png?width=817&format=png&auto=webp&s=093e583a223a29a4d4ef71801226cf1c14cb972a\n\nToday I was \u201coff\u201d but had a tesla swing I averaged down (WAY too late) and was able to close out in the morning before I had to actually leave for the day. I am glad I did too because I really thought when I left I was leaving in a bullish momentum market and when I checked back later I was dead wrong. Markets took a turn. Thankful for not getting greedy there. \n\nThis was my best week I have had since May profits wise, however, comparatively since my position size was about 2-3x bigger back in May this comparatively is the best week I have had this year yet. \n\nThis is definitely one of my strongest months I have had too hitting just under $10k profits and averaging 83.6% over the whole month. \n\nYoutube video will be up later tonight!
