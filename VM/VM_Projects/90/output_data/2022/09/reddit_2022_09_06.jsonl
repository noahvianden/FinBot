They have a good chance to double their sales volume.\n* The more sales they have, the better economies of scale kick in, and the more profitable each sale is. Thus, even if they don't perfectly double their sales, they still have a good chance to double or almost double their income.\n* If they double 13B in 2022 income, they'll have $26B income in 2023.

As an example, Austin's current output is limited by production ramp, \\*not\\* by availability of 2170 cells. That's because working out kinks, optimizing production, and training are all nontrivial activities that take time.\n\nIt makes sense that, in the short term, Tesla could accelerate the production ramp by focusing exclusively on 2170 packs.
