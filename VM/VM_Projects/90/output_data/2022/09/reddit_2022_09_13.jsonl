{"title": "Mark Zuckerberg is \u2018continuing to derail\u2019 Facebook, says Harvard expert: \u2018He\u2019s really lost his way\u2019", "selftext": "Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s poor leadership skills are slowly dragging Meta toward failure, a Harvard expert says.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s shortcomings as CEO are \u201ccontinuing to derail\u201d the tech giant formerly known as Facebook, according to Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former CEO of medical technology company Medtronic.\n\n\u201cI think Facebook is not going to do well as long as he\u2019s there,\u201d George tells CNBC Make It. \u201cHe\u2019s likely one of the reasons so many people are turning away from the company. He\u2019s really lost his way.\u201d\n\nGeorge has spent the past 20 years studying leadership failures in the workplace, recently compiling those findings into a new book called, \u201cTrue North: Leading Authentically in Today\u2019s Workplace, Emerging Leader Edition.\u201d\n\nIn short, George says bosses that lose sight of their most deeply held beliefs, values and purpose as a leader \u2014 especially in the name of money, fame or power \u2014 are doomed to fail. And after decades of researching high-profile corporate collapses, he says he sees striking similarities to Zuckerberg and Meta today.\n\nZuckerberg and Meta did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It\u2019s request for comment. The Meta CEO is largely responsible for his company\u2019s meteoric growth to this point, transforming the company he co-founded in 2004 into a tech giant with a $450.46 billion market cap, as of Monday morning.\n\nIn doing so, he helped create the modern-day social media industry \u2014 a move he\u2019s attempting to replicate now by repositioning his company into the metaverse space. Given his past success, it might be unwise to bet against him, as CNBC\u2019s Jim Cramer said on \u201cSquawk Box\u201d in February.\n\n\u201cI know that this is probably out of fashion, I have total faith in Mark Zuckerberg. I think Zuckerberg\u2019s going to be able to pull off ... the metaverse,\u201d Cramer said, adding that Meta has a track record of rebounding after stock dips, scandal and controversy. \u201cThere\u2019s some people you have to bet on. And if you go back to 2018 to that horrible summer breakdown ... no one thought these guys could come back.\u201d\n\nStill, George says Meta is bound to fail as long as Zuckerberg remains at the helm. Here\u2019s why:\n\nFull article: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/harvard-expert-mark-zuckerberg-is-continuing-to-derail-facebook.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/09/12/harvard-expert-mark-zuckerberg-is-continuing-to-derail-facebook.html)\n\nMark Zuckerberg is \u2018continuing to derail\u2019 Facebook, and his poor leadership skills are slowly dragging it toward failure, Harvard expert Bill George says.
