I am talking about the day when some brokers illegally stopped letting people buy. At that day still 60 million shares traded hands, and we know for sure that most of those wasnt retail buying, because retail couldnt buy. Then what was that? Well, people selling shares due to fear and shorts buy to cover their positions. So the sec report is right, the price increase was indeed before that day. Sure, it might be hard to believe that so much shorts covered in a single day, and it would not have been possible without illegally stopping people buy. But 'thanks to' the brokers there were no buy pressure (because they prohibited it) and there was also huge fear (again, because they prohibited buying). 60 million shares was basically GME-s whole sharecount at the time, also, even then, not all shorts closed, just most of them. \n\nAbout the 100% utilization: lets not forget that GME still remains one of the most shorted company in the US market AND a huge amount of shares were moved to computershare, and even besides that a lot of retail are holding shares without lending out them, so the actual trading float is extremely small.

Those little words really mean the most and I\u2019ve learned quite a bit since it\u2019s release. Never hurts \n\nI see your view about retail/institution sell pressure accruing during the selling halt as an offset to the shorts closing buy pressure. However, we didn\u2019t see any increase in price during that time or directly after as a result of that buying pressure. In order for that price to drop as violently as it did once the halt expired there would\u2019ve had to be selling pressure *far* outweighing short closing buy pressure yea? That simply was not the case since the books support investors holding their shares in mass through the event (not far fetched to conclude the shares traded were also synthetic if the *reported* SI% was ~100%). I can only think that a larger position was taken to plunge the price as they shoveled the previous bills under the bed for later. Figure 5 in that report shows ~95% SI during that day dropping to ~20% meaning to offset that position ~150% the float would\u2019ve had to trade to keep it neutral right? To be transparent, that\u2019s a genuine question. Im pretty sure the books bid:ask execution ratio is important to price discovery and the spread plays a relatively sizable role. To actually drop the price on top of the ~45M shares being sold to offset the ~45M being purchased we would still need additional sell volume. Now we\u2019re looking at a volume in the range at conservative minimum ~120M volume on the day which we saw was actually closer to 60M. Not to mention this would have to occur almost all at once.\n\nTo be honest, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there is a gaping hole in that thought process centered around market mechanics that I do not grasp. However, with my current knowledge it seems impossible for the observed price action to occur between the volume and SI% change. And at the least, this is where I deduce my agreeance that the short position is still extremely large.

The are not going to be generating those in a few years when other OEMs have ramped up their own production.  Without those, and calculating automotive margins the same way the rest of the industry does, you get margins of 23.6%.\n\nI'm not sure why sales from the app store would count in automotive revenue and not go in the services segment (other than Tesla trying to pile high margin activities in the automotive segment to juice the margin figure and dump all of the low margin activities in the services segment).  However, I think an in-car app store is going to produce far less revenue than you'd think.

The timeline seems to be still holding. WV seems to be in a strong position to be one of the 20 percent. I have been impressed by there progress in this space. That said I don't think they will beat tesla for the following reasons.\r \n\n1. Tesla has time and again shown leadership and foresight. Master plan part 3 already is working on solving the problems of scale. There is going to be a supply crunch. There is going to be a mad dash for resources. Tesla is finally in a place to be the no 1 customer for any resource. They have been securing deals for resources at favorable rates. They have the demand to get them over this supply crunch as a 15 - 20 percent increase in prices has not decreased their demand. I don't see any reason why Tesla cannot maintain 50 % growth.\r \n2. If you look at total revenue and total profit. The lead that tesla has is magnified even further. Even if it's the same number of vehicles. If you are average selling price is 2x and gross profit is 2x then you have effectively 4 times the profit for the same amount of cars.\r\n3. Any company with any investment in ICEs has a lead weight around their feet. I don't understand why people think that the sale of ICEs will go down slowly in an orderly fashion. If there are 30 millions new EVs on the road every year as the above article suggests by 2025 which are cheaper or have price parity to ICEs and are cheaper to run and maintain who is going to pay up for a new ICE vehicle. Who is going to take the risk of buying a depreciating asset with an unknown value in even 2 to 3 years time. By this time the writing won't just be on the wall the whole wall will be glowing hot. The pandemic has shown that people can delay new car purchases by 1 to 2 years if needed.\r\n4. Economies of scale break down even by 5 to 10 percent reduction in volume. I have not seen any plans by automakers of winding down their ICE investments. Any money invested in ICEs over the next 2 3 years is wasted money. WV is better positioned then most due to their high EV percentage but how can they compete with Tesla when they have a smaller war chest, they are lagging behind and they have to prop up a failing ICE side. If they don't invest in their ICE business they risk losing 25 to 33 percent of their valuation as the market still doesn't see ICEs as a dead end.\r\n5. There are advantages for OEMs in some ways. They have experience managing supply chains and they do know how to build the other components of cars but they also have big disadvantages like winding down a business with very unpredictable demand, stakeholders who are going to be dragging their heels throughout (also true for WV where their CEO was nearly ousted) and resource competition. They were waiting for commodification of batteries but that won't be the case until well after their expiration date due to competition.\r  \n\r  \nThese are my two cents.

{"title": "6-14-22 SPY Daily TA (and a breakdown of how to trade FOMC)", "selftext": "Are we having fun yet guys? 5 red days in a row\u2026 from high to low a total of -$45.23 or -12.2% in one 5 trading sessions. I believe this is the worst 5 days in SPY history in the last 20 years. Even the COVID drop and 2008 crash was not as aggressive or big of drops as these ones\u2026 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r2io3tmrtn591.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=df8507873be723a8febb67ae01cb2ce3b2c36088\n\nMy thoughts are that we were told 50 bps next 3 meetings... jpow VERY rarely does anything he doesnt say he would do... IF he changes his tune here he knows markets are gonna tank. he has to be tactful... so he will do something like CPI is peaking and slowing... we are doing xyz blah blah blah if we do 75 to 100bps hike right now we are going to wreck xyz so we are still going to do 50bps hike like we planned. Come August meeting if we see inflation has not peaked as anticipated we will go ahead and do a 100bps hike...   \n \n\nPlus JPOW now has an arguably good PPI that beat expectations to use in his favor.\n\nif we do 50bps hike markets rally.\n\nif we do 75bps hike we rally (priced in).\n\nif we do 100bps we die.  \n \n\nThough I expected some sort of small rally today into FOMC and VIX to unwind so at this point really anything is possible. However, what JPOW says will be very important tomorrow and will guide the market for the next month or so in my opinion. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ct00en0ttn591.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=8cb8f680e1802d66dc0000c14b8c26f6c9f921c8\n\nIt was a fairly untradeable and frustrating day today where there was no momentum and no continuation. Overall we saw SPY make 14 total reversals intraday today. The biggest of them was the opening hour. We saw an immediate sell off followed by a near 10mil volume 15min candle that was arguably trying to breakout only for a \u00bc volume candle to come in and take us back to drill down. After that first 45minutes of movement we just saw sideways burn and failed breakout after breakout. 373 support looked extremely strong all day until PH when we broke through it only to see a fairly impressive rally EOD. Bulls really tried their EOD but failed to close SPY green. A very frustrating and untradeable day. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/27s7mb0utn591.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d95986965d5ba89e1794343d602a3a3bbbdfbff\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/iwbez7qutn591.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=76d52d72c284340eb039671655d25b2d3038a18e\n\nThe daily does show that we are attempting to hold 373.5 as support now. It was encouraging not seeing a massively red day today also. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tzoz8shvtn591.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2242c634c6473212631bae0df9e0b48ab979fdb\n\nThe weekly bounced right at support today. IF we get a bad FOMC tomorrow and we drill we are going to be looking at not only a massive weekly gap but we are going to break fairly large support and be looking to bounce off the weekly 200ema at 363. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5lqvw56wtn591.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea9213e2509ea1a1665489ab13b02071bc48ff4a\n\nThe VIX was a big part of the frustration today in that it just didn\u2019t wanna find a trend. Overall until EOD it was unwinding but once she hit that 32.1 level it rejected fairly hard and bounced causing that EOD sell off. The VIX really needs to get under 32 and look for the 20s again for the bulls to have any hope.\n\nWith FOMC tomorrow there is bound to be a lot of fuckery. Most likely we will see the morning chose a trend from 930am till about 1030am and trade sideways till about 1230pm or so when we will see it inverse itself and trend closer to opening price. \n\n2pm is when the FOMC rate hike is released. We should see a fairly significant move with that. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f175tlywtn591.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e544028dd690f3bd3b3dbf409b59b06c1e61217\n\n  \n This was last FOMC as you can see at 2pm with the rate hike we were fairly indecisive forming a 15minute doji\u2026 JPOW started talking at 230pm. Markets found their bottom and from their rallied until close. (this way May 4th FOMC).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y06ylenxtn591.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=63dedce4c59778d289322a41c9f0801be1e7b87b\n\nMarch 16th same thing\u2026 we saw markets at 2pm react to the FOMC rate hike and by 230 when JPOW started talking we were finding bottom and at 245pm we were in the trend we were going to continue in and rallied till close. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rz9affmytn591.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b895ce71a9e491d3dbf1757ec89cdba9a91aa6e2\n\n  \n Now for January we didn\u2019t have a rate hike but I believe ole JPOW finally got scared about inflation here and scared the markets\u2026 so at 2pm when FOMC was released we saw the doji (like may 4th) and then when he started his presser at 230pm we started our downward trend by 245 we were confirmed. However this trend peaked at 3pm and then slightly recovered. I don\u2019t really equate this January one to much since there is no expected rate hike so we really mainly should focus on May and March. \n\n2pm- March 16th( -1.01%)  May 4th ( +/- 0.5% both ways\u2026 up first then down)\n\n215pm- March 16th (+0.5%) May 4th (down 0.3% then up +0.8%)\n\n230pm- March 16th (dropped 0.3% and then rallied 1.2%) May 4th (down 1.1% then up +1.5%)\n\n245pm- March 16th (+0.5%) May 4th (+1.2%)\n\n3pm to 4pm- March 16th (+1.32%) May 4th (1.4%)\n\nMarch 16th- from 2pm open price dropped a total of 1.5% in 30 minutes then rallied 2.5% from 230pm low till 4pm close.\n\nMay 4th- from 2pm open price dropped a total of 1% in 30 minutes then rallied 3.61% from the 230pm low till 4pm close.\n\nSo how do we play tomorrow? Well I would be looking for about a 1% drop from the 2pm candles opening price so say we open the 2pm candle tomorrow at 375 look for 371.25 as a 230pm bottom. From there you can expect about a 2.5% to 3.6% green rally. \n\nSo you could either open a straddle with 0dte and about 3-5OTM strikes (do this at like 155pm) set the take profits on both to 30-50% and i would be shocked not to see both of them fill. Or you could open both and set 100% take profits on both and play it that way. One of them is almost guaranteed to hit 100% and then the other will be free. Most FOMC meetings you can easily turn 50-100% profits a few different times. \n\nAnother way to play it and probably the better way to play it is to wait till about 230pm for a bottom (or top I guess) and buy an option then. Most likely after 230pm we will see a great move one way or another. I would look for the VIX as a guide for this too if VIX is rocketing and you are thinking calls you are wrong\u2026 but if VIX is unwinding and you are thinking calls then you are right. By 245pm we should have a fairly clear direction and you should be safer to enter a play. \n\nFor me I will be waying my options of a 30% take profit straddle placed at 159pm and then I will look for a play at the bottom near 230 to grab a fairly OTM option on to ride till at least 3pm. \n\n10% challenge- \n\nOverall a fairly frustrating day. I took some calls at 10am when we looked to breaking out and everything look fairly bullish. But of course those got wrecked pretty quickly. I had planned to hold those till tomorrow thinking we would see the big green rally but once we lose 373 EOD I knew my hopes of seeing a green close for those were low and I took the L. I played a few scalps last 45minutes that all pretty much washed eachother out. Looking forward to tomorrow and FOMC being over and hopefully we get some clearer trend and momentum days. Overall there was just zero follow through today and by time momentum was confirming a trade it was reversing already. These sideways VIX days are brutal. \n\nToday was a good day of patience and recognizing when the setups aren\u2019t working in your favor. Sitting cash sometimes is the hardest thing we do and not FOMOing into every play. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2axheei1un591.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=97b47ce2055cd19205a8061baf8bc389e3ef4c4e\n\nSitting cash gang overnight. I wont be trading in the morning till probably 12 or so as im on dad duty and kids have swim lessons in the AM. But I can honestly say I highly doubt ill miss much in the morning as I suspect it to be very sideways.", "id": "vcewfy", "created_utc": 1655244446.0, "score": 68, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|196|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1796|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v8vbnd/6922_spy_daily_ta_bonus_cpi_day_trade_breakdown/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ur9t1w/51622_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/spxvil/spy_210_the_bear_rages_on/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uyxorz/52722_spy_pre_market/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skp8ci/24_spy_recap_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vcewfy/61422_spy_daily_ta_and_a_breakdown_of_how_to/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/us0d0d/51722_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rj1up5/december_17th_spy_recap_and_next_week_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v23784/53122_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v9jfp2/61022_spy_weekly_review_fomc_analysis/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v6ewtr/6622_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5w3m/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5xtr/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyng6s/buy_the_rumor_sell_the_news_hear_me_out_here/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/riyt4w/december_17th_spy_recap_and_next_week_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/usqmwy/51822_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v2sj0k/6122_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v7clxo/6722_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwdhxd/52322_spy_daily_ta_bonus_fomc_minutes_reaction_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwdk8h/52322_spy_daily_ta_bonus_fomc_minutes_reaction_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v3mubg/6222_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v82mas/6822_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgqp0q/spy_dec_14th_recap_and_dec_15th_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/v48yk1/6322_spy_weekly_ta_and_analysis/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uthl4s/51922_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uthspd/51922_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ux4ri2/52422_spy_daily_ta_fomc_minutes_prediction/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vbnl4b/61322_spy_daily_ta_and_fomc_anticipation/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vcewfy)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vcewfy)\n    \nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37660691142082214}, {"body": "Hmm.
