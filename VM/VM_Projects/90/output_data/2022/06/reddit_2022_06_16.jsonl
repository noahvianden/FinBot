A 20% increase can lead to 100% profits especially in small cap oil stocks. A 20% decrease can cause them to crater. So when oil is overall bullish it can literally double or triple your money with margin trading. I think a large part is due to the fact that oil has a basic overall cost for refining, storage and transportation, so increases to high levels don't really increase profits in a linear way but can increase them almost exponentially for companies.
