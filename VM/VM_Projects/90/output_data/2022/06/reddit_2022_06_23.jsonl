{"title": "My Plan for Intergenerational Wealth : UVXY ---> SVXY ---> SPY ---> Real Estate", "selftext": "TLDR; Buy leveraged volatility products....MARKET CAPITULATION...Vix spikes before S&P bottom.... hold gains in SVXY to make more money while waiting for S&P bottom... Buy S&P bottom and hold....shop for houses in gaped housing market....take back our property from the big banks.\n\nAs inflation continues to compound and fuck us day after day, it can be easy to get beat down in the dumps. If you're like me, you are getting paid nothing at a job that you are gonna lose by the end of July, yet you still dump all of your measly pay stubs directly into the market like the degenerate gambler you are. Some may call it irresponsible, I call it making lemonade out of the most bitter of lemons.\n\n**The lemons:**\n\nWe all know a recession is coming. We all know inflation will not stop with these pathetic 75 bp hikes. We all know that the housing market will crash. We all know that the stock market will crash. The fun and games from 2021 are over. Historically, retail traders get absolutely fucked under these conditions, and at the end of the boom bust cycle, the rich get richer as they extract wealth from the retail bagholders. This will happen no more. While yes, food and gas are beginning to become unaffordable and it seems like the end is near, I like to stay glass half full. **I aim to turn this \"once in a lifetime\" market turmoil into an event of massive wealth creation, and you should too.** My plan has 4 main phases which I will list below.\n\n***THE LEMONADE:***\n\n**Phase 1: Accumulation (UVXY)--** Currently, I am in phase one of my plan: **buying as many shares of leveraged volatility products as possible.** Since Jan 2022 we have seen much market volatility. Although the market has sold off 20%, there has not been a large move on the VIX. This is not concerning to me. It seems to be indictive of organized selling and exiting from institutions. This has given me time to buy UVIXY on the dips as they oscillate during the sell off. Looking at 2008 this same set up can be seen. VIX did not move much at all as the S&P sold off 20%. It was not until the capitulation when VIX spiked. When will capitulation occur? I'm not sure, but I am damn sure that I will have all the capital I can spare in volatility products when the day comes. I will begin to sell when VIX cracks 50, but my price target is 60+ or possibly 70s.\n\n **Phase 2: Bridging the Gap (SVXY)--** So VIX pops off, now what? Well if you look at the graph below, VIX spikes 4 whole months before the S&P bottoms. So the question is, what do I do with all my gains from the volatility squeeze? I can't just have them sitting around uninvested. Answer: SVXY. SVXY is a leveraged inverse VIX etf. As VIX drops from the 60s to the 30s I can make an over 50% return by buying and holding SVXY until the market finally bottoms. This will allow me to make money while I wait to buy the REAL dip \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Capitulation in 2008, VIX did not spike until well after an S&P bear market. ](https://preview.redd.it/4d4saqp5if791.png?width=3781&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddcb1e3dfa3aecfd55f9bb4085449603c1e75bb3)\n\n**Phase 3: Buying the REAL Dip (SPY)--** S&P Price target? See burry tweet below. Once I buy SPY, I will finally be able to rest, as the previous steps will require extreme stress and paying more attention to the market than any autist should.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[ Barring a miracle, I will not consider buying the S&P until it nears 2000. ](https://preview.redd.it/xglbiewaif791.png?width=1625&format=png&auto=webp&s=a12910d0f41a0d4944a6c243d8cfa9c5f3572d66)\n\n**Phase 4: Own Real Assets (Buy a House)--** Honestly getting tired of typing at this point. We all know that for each % increase in the federal funds rate, housing prices drop by like 10-20% or some bullshit. On top of this, the housing market moves much more slowly than the equities market, so I will have ample time to shop around after the slow inevitable decline of the housing market.\n\nI never thought owning a house would be in the cards for me (especially after I lost all my GME gains betting against Tesla). It's time for redemption of every bear who went short too early back in 2021. **It's time for us retail investors to weather this bust cycle and end up with MORE money than we started it with. LETS BUY BACK OUR HOUSES FROM THE BIG BANKS.**\n\n**-FreshJury**\n\n \n\n[ Positions or Ban. ](https://preview.redd.it/du2v49ijif791.png?width=2987&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a9aaec14f749cb78c4913fc828aece72b043523)", "id": "vj63p9", "created_utc": 1656015552.0, "score": 74, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|15|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|631|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rkv7fa/long_uvxy_a_potentially_lucrative_play_for_any/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/s87uh1/volatility_squeeze_incoming/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vj5wv8/my_plan_for_intergenerational_wealth_uvix_svxy/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/vj63p9/my_plan_for_intergenerational_wealth_uvxy_svxy/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=vj63p9)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=vj63p9)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.39356642961502075}, {"body": "Safer bet, ignore phase 1, start with SVXY at the spike.
