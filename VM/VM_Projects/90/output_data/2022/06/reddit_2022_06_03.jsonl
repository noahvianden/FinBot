To match inflation since the last time we saw this sort of inflation, you\u2019d need to see the minimum wage easily at $20 without any controversy about it whatsoever, along with commensurate increases in professional wages on up the scale. We are nowhere near that. \n\nThe companies reporting supply shortages are saying that through the audio, read their numbers. It\u2019s not shortages, it\u2019s rising costs.

Judging by the Fed continuing to pretend maybe they\u2019ll sneak up on a \u201cneutral rate\u201d \u2014 these folks know they truly can sit on product for a year.

Yep people are still buying things they don\u2019t need, but that\u2019s because no significant action has yet truly taken place toward demand destruction. The pump money is still in the system. \n\nThe best stage is continued high inflation and rotation into consumer defensives and we already see numbers out of places like WalMart saying the consumer is tapped BEFORE demand destruction.
