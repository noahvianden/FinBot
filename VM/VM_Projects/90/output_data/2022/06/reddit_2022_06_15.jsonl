How do I know this? We are at 3.6% unemployment rate, which is lower than the typical definition of \"full employment\" of 4% unemployment rate. Theoretically, if everyone is employed and working as hard as they can, then we would never have runaway inflation like we have now. The hard truth of runaway inflation at more-than-full employment tells us that our productivity is extremely low.\n\nHow do we fix this productivity issue? Raising interest rates. No more easy money means all these unproductive businesses will either go bankrupt or change management in order to prevent bankruptcy.
