A \"potential\" future revenue is worth more than actual revenue today based on how the market works, except when risk-free yield is high which it is. I am honestly impressed the stock didn't tank further. And ofc, a stock does not equal the company behind it. The company is equally strong as before but a lot of the \"potential\" future revenue must now be discounted for the yield so -40% make a lot of sense right now. But its not cheap. It will be cheapish if tesla bot, fsd etc is a thing. It will be cheap if somehow tesla's data collection from the street can be used to maneuver a tesla bot within your household and make him do stuff that is actually relevant.  It will be cheap if fsd will be allowed by law everywhere in the world and fully work.\n\nA lot of things need to come together but I would say it is doable. But perfect execution is baked into the stock. This plus falling/steady yields on debt which may not happen for some time. One of the reasons the stock didnt come down further is the network effects aka people that own tesla stock are like a cult and cult-like behavior can create an additional margin of safety on top of what is the actual margin of safety. You see this with GME as well.
