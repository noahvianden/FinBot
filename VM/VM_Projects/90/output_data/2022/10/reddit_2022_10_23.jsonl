{"title": "The Market Has Bottomed, For Now... Likely Probably, Maybe?", "selftext": "SPX had a large rally on Friday and it is now above the 25 Days Moving Average. The shape of the 25 Days Moving Average is also flattening so it seems market sentiment is changing somewhat.\n\nThe secondary downtrend line is now broken. It seems the market wants to rally more but [VIX and VIX9D](https://alphapursuits.com/vix-table/) remain elevated on Friday despite a huge SPX rally. This indicates people are still hedging heavily and do not believe the rally will continue.\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\n[My personal thinking](https://alphapursuits.com/the-market-bottom-for-now-vix-spx-review-10-23-2022/) is that the market will likely move sideways until November but in a wide range (based on what VIX is telling us).\n\nThe 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci Retracement lines should act as resistance and support lines respectively. The market will not likely go beyond these two lines until the FOMC meeting.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fjvjzixsskv91.png?width=1155&format=png&auto=webp&s=c15fd7b4dbbc8580fe86ede2fee32677c10420a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xn58ye1uskv91.png?width=1129&format=png&auto=webp&s=690184dbb0101afa40ea9dc94acba5e2cc743869", "id": "ybl0og", "created_utc": 1666539988.0, "score": 31, "upvote_ratio": 0.66, "num_comments": 89, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|12|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|17|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|5 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=ybl0og)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=ybl0og)\n    \n>TL;DR: - SPX is above the 25 Days Moving Average and the secondary downtrend line is broken.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5910550355911255}, {"body": "No bottom until suicide hotline is pinned", "score": 75, "replies": [{"body": "Already happened earlier this year .", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1516248881816864}, {"body": "2023 is the year I hear", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11546067893505096}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.24302785098552704}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 32, "replies": [{"body": "I'm in your camp with the GDP; if you look at the atlanta fed GDP nowcast the whole reason the forecast magically jumped from 0.5 percent to 2.3+% was because of a category called \"advance estimates\".\n\nOn friday they basically lured all the sideline money \"gunk in the system\" that creates these nasty rallies into the most epic call buying and leverage etf buying volume and premiums of the ENTIRE year (some of it all time records)\n\nWSJ article plant and BOJ intervention friday morning exacerbated this and weird articles demanding its \"rally time\" paired with severe risk going into big tech earnings this week that no one is pricing.\n\nLong story short, I won't rule out that they cooked the GDP forecast to lure in the excess liquidity they've had a hard time evaporating from the system.\n\nChina q3 gdp comes out this week, followed by a negative US gdp print no one was expecting and all the cheap April 2020 leverage money blows out over the next couple weeks because they were lured into a trap by their own greed.\n\n...Fed will not have to raise rates aggressively if the market is baited and offered up as the sacrificial lamb.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "Bro...
