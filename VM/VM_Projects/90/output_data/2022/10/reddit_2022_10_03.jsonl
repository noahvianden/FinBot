{"title": "Cargo Shipowners Cancel Sailings as Global Trade Flips From Backlogs to Empty Containers", "selftext": "From the Wall Street Journal:\n\nOcean carriers are canceling dozens of sailings on the world\u2019s busiest routes during what is normally their peak season, the latest sign of the economic whiplash hitting companies as inflation weighs on global trade and consumer spending.\n\nThe October cancellations are a sharp reversal from just a few months ago, when scarce shipping space pushed\u00a0freight rates higher and\u00a0carriers\u2019\u00a0profits to record levels. Last October, companies like Walmart Inc. and Home Depot Inc. were chartering their own ships to get around bottlenecks at ports to meet a surge in demand for imports.\n\nTrans-Pacific shipping rates have plummeted roughly 75% from year-ago levels. The transportation industry is grappling with weaker demand as big retailers cancel orders with vendors and step up efforts to cut inventories. FedEx Corp. recently said it would cancel flights and park cargo planes because of a sharp drop in shipping volumes. \n\nOn Thursday, Nike Inc. said it was sitting on 65% more inventory in North America than a year earlier and would resort to markdowns.The erosion in global economic conditions, from the war in Ukraine to factory shutdowns in China, have dealt heavy blows to trade activity. The International Monetary Fund has cut its forecast for global growth in gross domestic product multiple times this year. Consumer prices are rising at the fastest rates in years in the U.S., countries in Europe and other parts of the world.\n\nOne response to the melting demand has been to reduce sailing trips. In September, container capacity offered by ship operators in the Pacific was down 13%, dropping the equivalent of 21 ships that can each move 8,000 containers in a single voyage, from a year earlier, according to shipping-data providers Xeneta and Sea-Intelligence.\u00a0\u00a0For the two weeks starting Oct. 3, a total of about 40 scheduled sailings to the U.S. West Coast from Asia and 21 sailings to the East Coast from Asia have been scrapped, according to the data companies as well as customer advisories viewed by The Wall Street Journal. Typically at this time of year, an average of two to four sailings a week are blanked, the industry\u2019s term for canceled sailings.\u00a0\n\nCarriers also are increasingly canceling trips along key Asia-to-Europe routes, the data providers said.\n\n\u201cIn the first week of October, one-third of previously announced capacity will be blanked and for the second week, it will be around half,\u201d said Peter Sand, chief analyst at Xeneta. \u201cThe downturn pace in recent weeks has been very fast and it looks like carriers misread the low volumes of a nonexistent peak season.\u201d\n\nThe period between late summer and early fall typically is the busiest time of year for the largest carriers, as retailers and other importers build inventories ahead of the holiday shopping season.\u00a0\n\n**Daily freight rates now average $3,900 to move a single container across the Pacific, compared with $14,500 at the start of the year and more than $19,000 in 2021, according to the Freightos Baltic Index.**\n\n\\-----\n\nOriginal Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/cargo-shipowners-cancel-sailings-as-global-trade-flips-from-backlogs-to-empty-containers-11664681947](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cargo-shipowners-cancel-sailings-as-global-trade-flips-from-backlogs-to-empty-containers-11664681947)", "id": "xusbuy", "created_utc": 1664823964.0, "score": 440, "upvote_ratio": 0.97, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "Every shortage is followed by a glut, the economy has toilet rolls stacked to the ceiling so to speak.", "score": 185, "replies": [{"body": "Bullwhip effect.", "score": 27, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.16369104385375977}, {"body": "And shit collateral stacked to the ceiling too", "score": 34, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.4041211009025574}, {"body": "What if they\u2019re canceling sailings, just to keep the shipping price up?
