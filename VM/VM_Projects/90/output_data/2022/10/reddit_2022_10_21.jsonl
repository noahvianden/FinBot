{"title": "The stars are aligning for BlueWalker3 to unfurl. Deep space DD on the precise timing of an upcoming Direct 2 Mobile 5g satcom catalyst.", "selftext": "**TL/DR** There are indications that ASTS SpaceMobile 5g direct to cellphone broadband test satellite will unfurl this weekend. This is a pivotal milestone/catalyst for the company as it represents the largest commercial/known phased array ever deployed in space. The exact date for this is not revealed by the company. But I present in this writeup how the timing of this can be estimated.\n\n**Background.**\n\n* **Size matters.** SpaceMobile constellation will have the largest antenna/ phased array real-estate ever deployed in Space by man. This is needed to communicate with tiny phones. See my [previous WSB post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pvciwf/ast_spacemobile_the_black_swan_of_low_earth_orbit/) (1 year old).\n* **First mover matters.** Succesful deployment shows ASTS will be first to possess the technology needed. As coveted by Elon Musk and T-Mobile, Thales-Alenia Space and Ericsson, among others. But ASTS and their [partners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRvLA4YMhL8) (link is a video) American Towers, Nokia, Vodafone, Rakuten etcetera will be first to market with D2D broadband upon the success of this upcoming milestone.\n* **Seeing is believing.** There are operational on-board cameras on BlueWalker3. There is also another satellite that will take photos of the unfurling, according to CEO statements in the Q2 call 2022. This means there will be photos of this achievement, not just for the company, but for telecommmunication services sector as such and for humanity.\n* **Access to internet matters.** The first mover to this market will be able to serve hundreds of millions of subscribers connecting to commercial off the shelf cellular phones already on the market. The 20+ Mobile Network Operators that ASTS partnered with worldwide has in excess of 1.8 Bn subscribers. Their greenfield where there currently are no towers envelop hundreds of millions of uncovered subscribers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**The satellites.**\n\n**ASTS BlueWalker 3**  \\- a novel form factor direct 2 mobile communications test satellite in LEO.\n\n[The way BlueWalker3 travelled to Space. ASTS has a multi-launch agreement with the top launch provider in the world SpaceX for this, and the following commercial satellites that are now in production.](https://preview.redd.it/3nphpbble5v91.png?width=1236&format=png&auto=webp&s=33bbac3f41abf339e03b3ee815fa7aea735c76fe)\n\n**Succesful launch. On September 10th** (sept 11 European time) AST launched BlueWalker3 on top of a Falcon 9 from pad 39a in Florida. The launch resulted in successful orbital insertion. It was a rideshare and stowed on top of  Space-X Starlink satellites. It travelled with its huge phased array folded inside a cylinder shaped Launch Vehicle Adaptor, with just the controlsat protruding at the top.As it was given a government license to launch, the company said thank you and filed an post-grant letter saying that oh by the way we are launching to a higher orbit. It is now cruising at approximately 510 km altitude.\n\n**Unfolding sequence.** By reverse engineering photos I conclude that the deployment of the satellite will have phases, and that it is folded up in a bi-directional fashion. These ways and steps  are not published in detail but a [recent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUBiGseRDw4) has confirmed some of my findings.\n\n\\- De-spin the satellite. This has been done successfully.\n\n\\- Shed the Launch Vehicle Adaptor. It is in 5 major parts held up by three bands with exploding bolts.\n\n\\- Unfold the huge phased array in one direction. (This you would like to film/ document)\n\n\\- Unfold in the other direction. (This you would like to film/ document)\n\n\\- Let the stoved gimbal Q/V backhaul antennas (responsible for A&B links in schematic below) pop down and deploy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Frequencies in use by BlueWalker 3. All Telemetry, Tracking and Control bands are already working, including image feed from onboard cameras.     Fronthaul direct to device links \\(C;D;E;F\\) will be tested on AT&T and FirstNet frequencies in the USA and with 10+ partners on all six inhabited continents and on the oceans in the following 5 months.

It is a big bird, widely believed to share satellite bus with the Hubble Space Telescope, including a camera with a 2.4 meters wide lens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Cutaway diagram of the Hubble Space Telescope. Credits: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center      There exists no de-classified photos of USA 338.](https://preview.redd.it/fwsxcr7sk5v91.png?width=985&format=png&auto=webp&s=83acfe41495b16c00ccc6fea559b7fa93656b984)\n\nOn the AST Q2 call slides there was featured two things. One, the mission patch for BlueWalker3. Two, the logo of the US SpaceForce. This means we have reason to believe that the asset photographing ASTS BlueWalker3, just like USA 338, is a US SpaceForce asset.\n\nBUT  we have no confirmation from the company that it really is USA 338.\n\nUSA 338 also deployed succesfully approximately 110 km / 70 miles below BlueWalker3 and to another more inclined orbit. This means IF it was to photograph BlueWalker3 as it whiz by, the pixels would be 1x1 inch resolution. Plenty for a 693 square foot (64 square meters) array.\n\nThe difference means these two satellites have conjunctions (align) 110 km straight above eachother every three days short of 2 hours 30 mins.\n\nThis type of satellite normally deploys into a much higher orbit. Having one in an orbit that is able to take high-res images of Low Earth Orbit spacecrafts is new.\n\n**The first conjunction   Oct 6th.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[First optimal conjunction of BlueWalker3 and USA 338 on October 6th.](https://preview.redd.it/t1ozb9lnp5v91.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=da702837256f367d963404e6d8de858fae22e574)\n\nThis is an image that I [generated using this tool](https://www.heavens-above.com/CloseEncounterDetails.aspx?satid1=53883&satid2=53807&mjd=59857.7495000000&) It represents the first conjunction that BlueWalker3 and USA 338 \"meet\" with a vertical distance represented by their respective shells but close to no horisontal distance. And that also fulfills other criteria, such as:\n\n\\- BlueWalker 3 is in daylight\n\n\\- BlueWalker3 footprint is within reach of terrestrial gateways.\n\nBefore this conjunction happened, I made a tweet asking what would happened to satellite Radar Cross Section upon this conjunction.\n\nUS SpaceForce data shows it shifted from \"medium\" to \"large\" on that day. Consistent with a change in flight configuration / form factor of the satellite. And so my question was promptly answered it grew \"larger\" on that day.\n\n**The second and third (optimal) conjunction.**\n\n[The second conjunction, in which ASTS BlueWalker3 and USA 338 align. Within Field-of view of BlueWalker3 above AST partner Kongsberg Gateway site, and in sunlight.   Sunlight part needs explaining as this is 2-5 minutes before the respective satellites pass into earths shadow, but still in sunlight.](https://preview.redd.it/5amjrcdat5v91.png?width=556&format=png&auto=webp&s=1593dcace78da0cdd72fcdef9c4e2c51893276d2)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The third conjunction, in which ASTS BlueWalker3 and USA 338 align. Straight above AST partner Kongsberg Gateway site, and in sunlight.](https://preview.redd.it/xalfakxfr5v91.png?width=509&format=png&auto=webp&s=a67d5efa734b52b79821f62f1c78a03481d72371)\n\nThese two sats has had the odd habit of meeting up in places like near Antarctica and central Siberia as of late, not to mention in pitch black darkness. In a time period that investors patience grown less bullish and short interest been increasing to record levels. Somewhat lowering share price.\n\nBut, if my conclusions and findings are correct, that is about to change on this weekend or start of next week the night between Tue-Wed UTC time.\n\nNew photo-op coming up! Time to unfurl and shine bright like a diamond to the world?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Fully deployed state, rendering by Twitter user Nicooben. \\(Edit: I see Nico in the comments section.

There are 168 satellites, which means roughly each satellite will cover 1,200,000 square miles. In terms of the US that means 3.2 satellites over the US at any one time. Which translates into 16,000 MBps (16,000,000 KBps) bandwidth for the whole US.\n\nNow go figure how many active users you would have at any one time in the US and divide 16,000 by that number and let me know what you think... 1 million active users in the US at once means 16 KBps per user. 100,000 at once would be 160 KBps per user. 10,000 at once would be 1.6 MBps per user which is not terrible but far from broadband. When you get to 5,000 active users at once in the US then you have 3.2 MBps it is actually semi-decent.\n\nNow reality may be much worse as there may be certain areas that have many users that make it worse where you really need it.\n\nBasically fundamentally this type of service cannot provide the needed bandwidth without a lot more satellites.
