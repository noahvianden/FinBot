Bernanke, who oversaw the Fed\u2019s response to the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recession, was known for his analysis of the Great Depression of the 1930s \u2014 in which he showed that bank runs had been a decisive factor causing the crisis to be so deep and prolonged. Diamond and Dybvig had meanwhile demonstrated how banks performed crucial social functions as intermediaries between savers who wanted instant access to their money, and borrowers who needed to make long-term investments. They showed how this made banks vulnerable to rumours of their imminent collapse \u2014 and how this vulnerability could be addressed through deposit insurance schemes and by governments acting as a lender of last resort.", "id": "y0etwc", "created_utc": 1665408521.0, "score": 290, "upvote_ratio": 0.89, "num_comments": 96, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|104|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1637|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/t0ppwu/porsche_to_ipo/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=y0etwc)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=y0etwc)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25106874108314514}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 324, "replies": [{"body": "Obama is the only Nobel peace prize winner who has bombed another Nobel peace prize winner.
