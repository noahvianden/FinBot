{"title": "Case Study: Timing the 2008 Bear Market Using the 200 Daily or 40 Week Moving Average", "selftext": "The consensus is that you absolutely can\u2019t time the market. This common advice is based on a Warren Buffett quote that goes something like this: \u201cAny attempts to pick the times to buy or sell, I think, are a mistake for 99% of the population. And I think that even attempts to pick individual securities is a mistake for people.\u201d\n\nI think his advice is spot on for anyone who is not interested in playing the investing game and wants to be assured a successful retirement. DCAing into low cost, broad based index funds works exactly as everyone thinks it does, and doing so ensures your long term success.\n\nHowever, there are other ways such as using the 200 day or 40 week moving average.\n\nWhat is the 200 day moving average?\n\nPer Investopedia: The 200-day moving average is considered a key indicator by traders and market analysts for determining overall long-term market trends.\n\nConsider the 200 dma a visual representation of the average price\u2019s movement. If it is moving higher, that means that the average price today is greater than the average price 200 days ago (trending up). If it\u2019s moving lower, then the current average price is less than it was 200 days ago (trending down).\n \nHow do institutions, hedge funds, and traders use the 200 dma?\n\nPer Paul Tudor Jones: \u201cI look at the 200-day moving average of closing prices. I\u2019ve seen too many things go to zero, stocks and commodities. The whole trick in investing is: \u2018How do I keep from losing everything?\u2019 If you use the 200-day moving average rule, then you get out. You play defense, and you get out.\u201d\n\nHow to use the 200 dma: The trend is your friend\n\nThe stock market is always moving up, down, or sideways. No one can predict what direction it will turn at any time. As bad as things look right now (war, energy prices, inflation, dumb dumb Fed, etc.), the market could turn upwards tomorrow and start the biggest bull run in history. All we can do is recognize which way it is heading RIGHT NOW and adjust accordingly.\n\nWhat is a Trend? \n\nPer Investopedia: An uptrend is a series of higher swing highs and higher swing lows. A downtrend is a series of lower swing highs and lower swing lows.\n\nCase Study: the 2008 Bear Market\n\nExit Criteria: Price must close below a declining or flat 200 day or 40 week moving average, then start a new downtrend by closing below the previous swing low. This eliminates false signals where the price dips below then back above the ma. \n\nEntry criteria: Price must close above the rising or flat 200 day or 40 week moving average, then start a new uptrend by closing above the previous swing high.\n\nGetting Out\n\n\u2022\tRed Flag #1: Spy closed below the 40 week ma several times between July and December 2007, but the 40 week ma was still rising. \n\n\u2022\tRed Flag #2: The 40 week ma levelled off the last week of the year starting 12/30/2007\n\n\u2022\tExit signal: Spy made a lower low below a declining 40 week ma the week of 1/6/2008 when it closed below the last swing low from 11/25/2007. This is your sign to get out at closing price $140.15\n\nThe market then started a 14 month decline until it bottomed in March of 2009 which included 6 bear market rallies.\n\nGetting Back In\n\n\u2022\tSPY bottomed the week of 3/1/2009, but no one would know that yet. It was not until 5/24/2009 that it closed above the 40 week ma, but the MA was declining still.\n\n\u2022\tSpy rose until  6/7/2009, where it created a swing high point, then dropped again. However, the 40 week ma began to flatten.\n\n\u2022\tEntry signal: The week of 7/19/2009 saw SPY close above the previous swing high and the 40 week MA turn upward. This was the entry signal at $98.06\n\nResults\n\nOut of Market: 1/13/2008 at $140.15\n\nBack into Market: 7/26/2009 at $98.06", "id": "xzt3jd", "created_utc": 1665341361.0, "score": 156, "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "num_comments": 94, "comments": [{"body": "If you do the same calculations since 2009 with these rules, you quickly realize the total opportunity costs from leaving the market and buying back at higher prices is much higher than the gain made in 2008-9 (as you have shown in your 2020 post).\n\nRough calculations based on yahoo charts, numbers may be off a bit I'll let you double check.

We'll see where we finish in 2022 (or 2023, hopefully not 2024!), but my guess is that if you take 2000 - the end of 2022 bear it will show that following the trend is better long term. I am open to learning otherwise though.\n\nThese numbers (both yours and mine) also don't take into account the effect on DCA and compounding.\n\nIf you DCA all the way down you have actually increased your capital contributed while decreasing your return, vs pausing your contributions until the reenter date.\n\nWhen you reenter with more capital it grows faster during the new bull market. Add paused DCA onto that and you have even more of an advantage. I'm sure some of it is offset by the small dips you showed, but my guess is the difference is made during the largest drops. \n\nIf 2 investors had 10k in 2008 and one went to cash, the one that went to cash and paused DCA during the bear reentered in 2009 with more than 10k, vs the person who continued to DCA all the way down.
