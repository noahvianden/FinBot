The estimated profit for Icahn Enterprises LP could exceed $250 million, it added.\n\nIcahn made the investment on the belief that Tesla Inc chief Musk wouldn't go through a trial that he looked likely to lose, the report said. He also believed that the stock was worth close to the mid-$30s in the long term.\n\nOther investors, including D.E. Shaw Group and Daniel Loeb's Third Point LLC, also placed bets on Twitter shares in recent months and could make sizable gains as well, according to the report.\n\nSource: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/icahn-others-clean-up-on-musk-s-twitter-about-face-11664926249](https://www.wsj.com/articles/icahn-others-clean-up-on-musk-s-twitter-about-face-11664926249)\n\nCarl Icahn made a $250 million profit yesterday after purchasing Twitter (TWTR) shares worth over $500 million months ago, betted Elon Musk will end up buying TWTR one way or another.
