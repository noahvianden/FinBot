{"title": "I missed the bus", "selftext": "I'm relatively new to options and have a small account but I've been following Unusual Whales and learning flow and have done decent in this downturn recently, mostly trading AAPL.  I played a 139 10/14 straddle for today bc I didn't know which way the market would go.  I was ITM on the 10/14 put yesterday (Wed.) and also had 10/28 puts and then bought a call at the end of day to hedge in case the market went up. \n\nAt 8:30am today I felt great with the gap down coming.  Should have sold all puts immediately but I waited bc the last few times I've sold too early.  Ended up selling all puts for profit and then added 4 more calls to my 1 call position (10/14 139c) at 0.45 (avg down from 2.15) which made my avg 0.80.  \n\nIt went in the right direction but as it consolidated shortly after 10am I thought it was about to plunge so I sold 5 calls for 0.55 to take a loss, mostly bc I was leaving for my kids' dentist appt and had no idea what the mkt would do.  With one day trade already counted against me, I just let whatever would be would be.\n\nThose freaking 139c I bought at 0.45, last I checked, were at 4.55.  My original $180 that I sold for $220 (not counting the one I held overnight which was a loss) turned into over $2,200.  That would have doubled my account in a day.\n\nGo ahead.
