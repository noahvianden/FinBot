{"title": "Car dealers are the next to fall", "selftext": "When we hear car dealerships, most of us think : big-mouthed, bright suited salesman trying to sell you a tincan on wheels at a Ferrari price. But all that is changing. Used car prices are coming down to a less crazy level, and people aren't buying. Between making house payments, food, and car payments, there really isn't a choice.  And car dealerships are feeling the squeeze.   \n\n\nSo why are used car prices plumetting ?\n\n# INFLATION \n\nBlackbook and Cox Automotive Manheim, the 2 biggest Auto auction in the US both came out with numbers showing  [a decline in wholesale price for used cars](https://publish.manheim.com/en/services/consulting/used-vehicle-value-index.html) \n\nDealers in the digital marketplaces, have continually overpaid for their pre-owned inventory AND they bought more cars than they were able to sell, or rather than people were willing to buy, because they are feeling the squeeze from inflation. Those overpayments are finally coming to roost, as they are  seeing a softening of per-vehicle and F&I profits.  \n\n# Sales from rental \n\nAnother problem is the rental market. \n\n[September Fleet Sales are starting to drop but remain Up 25% Yo](https://www.coxautoinc.com/market-insights/september-fleet-sales-drop-slightly-remain-up-nearly-25-year-over-year/)\n\nRental car companies, like Hertz, Enterprise, AVIS have been active at auctions, buying used cars to service their Fleets, but now, they're getting their rental fleets fulfilled from the new cars again, as supply chain and chip shortage problems start to wane, meaning the whole sale value has started to decline because you don't have those Rental car companies bidding up the price on used cars at auctions. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The industry leaders are doing bad \n\nThe 2 big boys : Carvana and Carmax all came out with disaster Q2 2022 earnings.   \n\n\nCarmax in particular has had a tough quarter :  Total retail used units sold decreased 6.4%, \n\nWholesale is where you can really see the pain :  Total wholesale units decreased 15.1% with gross profit per unit of $881, a decrease of $124 per unit \n\nThey bought 342,731 vehicles from  consumers and dealers, and sold  216,939 vehicles, and on these 200K vehicles, they lost $124 per vehicles which adds up to 240 Millions of lost profit. \n\nThe worst part comes from Carmax Auto Finance, who lost 40 Millions in the provision for loans. They have to set aside more than double (from 35 to 75 million) a provision for credit losses in case the amount of deliquencies in loan repayment are going up. \n\nAt the end of the day, people have to chose between paying rent, paying for food, and making car loan payments, and people can't go without the first 2.   \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# More and more delinquencies \n\n  [The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is concerned about Americans getting deeper into debt](https://joinyaa.com/guides/repo-rates-increasing/)\n\nSubprime Borrowers are falling behind; and delinquencies are up 33% over the 2 last quarters (from 1.6 to 2.4%) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd it's not better on the side of the OEMS, Supply chain issues persisting, weakening demand, leading to them having to hike up MSRPs to fight these problems. All this means less people are willing to buy, and the car dealers have to lower their mark-ups.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# So what's the play ?\n\nPuts on AN, SAH, and to a lesser degree, LAD. The only Car dealers that haven't been affected as badly when the Carmax and Carvana slew of bad news came out: \n\n[The Warnings from Carmax had little effect on AN and SAH](https://preview.redd.it/p4bnsbdpgmt91.png?width=755&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccd9c3bd13bfc99ce5cc8ed299df4126f4671a41)\n\nWith that, I wanna thank  u/Ok_Helicopter_3825 who mentioned it in one of the daily premarket discussions who talked about this play and I just did some further digging. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI compared the available Cash from Q1 and Q2 Balance Sheets of AN and found it has burned almost 300 Million $$$ : I suspect that they really overpayed and now have to get rid of their inventory rapidly \n\n[AN and SAH report on October 27th](https://preview.redd.it/xceyutjnhmt91.png?width=791&format=png&auto=webp&s=92d9beed7f670d769085f19d25c577fdc35492a1)\n\n# TLDR \n\nCar dealers are fucked.
