Making balancing 2-legged robot does not make it more precise, doesn\u2019t make it stronger and doesn\u2019t make it more consistent. Tesla would make much better to the world if they simply put their superb AI vision tech to use and focused on grabbing robot only - mount that grabbing arm on top of Amazons Kiva and there you are, you solved a problem that requires few dozen of millions people employed worldwide.

Plenty of techs enter the space with A LOT of hype and hopes.\n\nThe Internet. The computer. The automobile. The microwave oven. The quadrocopter. Who has ever said \"it'll never work\"?\n\nI don't know why you're not accepting a simple reality that this just *does* look like a hype - I'd gladly live to be proven wrong, but I just find it unlikely. Tesla Bot sounds like a toy bought by a multi-billionaire known for liking to buy stupidly expensive toys (have you heard about Twitter? :) ). Elon as many geeks probably thought that robots are cool. They are. But are they useful? That's a completely different story.\n\nAs for you post:\n\n\"More mobile\" - more mobile than what? A vehicle on tracks? Conveyor belt? As humanity we built plenty of devices that prove that humans are not really mobile. My car is way more mobile than myself, seems that rotating wheels can make device go faster than walking, eat that nature! Tracked vehicle has more grip. Conveyor belt is more energy efficient. What exactly is walking robot better with that would justify paying more (both in terms of upfront $$$ cost and machine complexity which translates to maintenance cost)\n\n\"Smaller footprint\" - not sure what you mean by that, but anyway I've never heard of \"big footprint\" to be any kind of a problem in the industry. And then I'm pretty sure in a factory or an airport nothing beats and will beat conveyor belts for next centuries. Even if Tesla Bot could fly it will likely *still* be less efficient than moving stuff over conveyor belts.\n\n\"Multiple/endless tasks\" - as I said, the actuators (robot \"hands\" if you like) would be very smart thing to build. Yes, solving vision and \"hands\" will be great invention. But then I'm pretty sure they will be mounted on flying drones or tracked vehicles - why? Because they're more mobile and more efficient. The only thing I can think of that walking solves (over tracked vehicles) is walking on stairs. But I've never heard of an industry that would ever say \"I wish our industrial robots could walk the stairs\". It just doesn't make sense, the problem of vertical movement is already solved well with elevators. Maybe the Search and Rescue operations could use it - but I believe it's already handled by Boston Dynamics and I just suspect that having robot \"walking\" on 4 legs will be better (just based on nature - 4-foot animals are more agile than 2-legged humans, 2-legged humans just save a bit on energy - important for biological creatures but is that relevant for robot?)", "score": 0, "replies": [{"body": "Either your contradicting yourself massively or I\u2019m miss understanding what you\u2019re trying to say.

It can move in any direction while taking up virtually no space, speed is the only disadvantage to conveyor or wheels. To argue wheels are more mobile is completely ignoring everything outside of speed. \n\nSmaller footprints are critical to efficiency in factories. what\u2019s better, a factory that makes 10 cars within 1000sq/f or one that makes 10 cars within 100sq/f ?

You're right and he said he'd have a working prototype in 2022 but I didn't see that thing do any complex tasks capable of working alongside workers on the Tesla production line. I can buy buy a more complex, compact robot at my local toy store then what he presented. More of his over promise and under deliver. If he in fact can make a robot that can replace a human (climbing a ladder, using a set of tools), he should have delayed. In how advance other companies are with robotics optimus is a joke.

The supercharger network and battery backup systems they make seem to have a lot of room to expand. \n\nSo I guess I'm wondering why are they bothering with human robotics?
