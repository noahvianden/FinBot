{"title": "The basics of what happened today", "selftext": "  \n\nThe main driver for today's volatile trading session was the scheduled Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting to discuss the Federal Reserve's monetary policy plan. The market sentiment was that the Fed would announce a more \"hawkish\" (a more aggressive plan) tightening of its monetary policy. So what does this all mean? \n\nMonetary policy has two main levers, the money supply, and interest rates. Without getting too deep in the weeds, the **money supply** is the quantity of money circulating in the economy. As the central bank, the Federal Reserve creates money by buying assets and adding them to its balance sheet. These transactions are primarily US Government bonds and mortgage backed securities. The Federal Reserve was aggressive by expanding the balance sheet to over $8.9 trillion through March of 2022. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Nearly $9 trillion on the balance sheet!!!](https://preview.redd.it/7nkyoc7g8zr81.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=63dcd2d1f9174e7cb5436bd9565e4d02ce721a73)\n\nThe **interest rates** are controlled through the Fed Fund Rate Spread. Essentially, the Central Bank sets two rates, one to lend and one to borrow. For example, the Federal Reserve's current interbank lending rate is 0.50%. So, large banks and financial institutions can borrow from the Federal Reserve for 0.50%. Alternatively, the current interbank borrow rate is 0.25%. So, large banks and financial institutions can lend to the Central Bank for 0.25%. The spread creates boundaries for the interbank lending market as its participants have to stay within this spread. The Fed Fund Rate was historically low at 0.00%-0.25% throughout the pandemic. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Blue line is the Effective Fed Fund Rate](https://preview.redd.it/hevkaf6h8zr81.png?width=935&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bee4394b3496abb03d56128b2b88dfd57ef3b29)\n\nTo summarize, the money supply impacts the amount of money in the economy\u2014the more money working in the economy, the more money available to spur growth. Similarly, the lower the interest rate, the lower the cost for companies and consumers to borrow money to spend in the economy. \n\nWhat happened today? The FOMC held a scheduled meeting and released the meeting details at 2 PM eastern. The markets slumped with anticipation of hawkish guidance from the Fed. The two main points from the meeting were that the Central Bank did have an aggressive plan to combat inflation. First, the Fed announced it would look to begin shrinking the balance sheet for the first time since 2019 and indicated that the balance sheet reduction could begin as soon as May. Second, the Fed announced that all members would be in favor of one or more 50 basis point rate hikes, which is double the typical rate increment of 25 basis points.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[VIX IS BLOOD GREEN!!!!](https://preview.redd.it/gxdpysdi8zr81.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e7df6305b858586b513e8ad218832585426e123)\n\nWhy does this matter? The lower money supply and higher interest rates hurt potential economic growth. There's less money to go around, and the available money costs more to borrow at higher rates. The Fed effectively raised the discount rate resulting in lower firm valuations in fundamental terms. \n\nWhat does this mean for investors and traders? The market will likely continue to experience high volatility and will go through a price discovery cycle in the short term. Simply put, traders who can trade volatility should love this, while permabull type traders will likely have some rough waters ahead. This should be considered a positive for investors as there will be quality entry point opportunities. Additionally, and maybe most importantly, this move should lead to a healthy and strong economy in the long term.", "id": "txx4d8", "created_utc": 1649281451.0, "score": 265, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|11 months ago\n**Total Comments**|329|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=txx4d8)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=txx4d8)\n    \nHey /u/StochasticDecay, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "VisualMod has challenged someone to post their positions! \n\nVisualMod, if someone has made a claim that they bought / sold something and fail to prove it within 24 hours, message the mods to have them banned.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
