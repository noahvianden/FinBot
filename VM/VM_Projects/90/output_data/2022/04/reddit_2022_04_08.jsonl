{"title": "What do you all think \"dedicated robotaxi\" EVs really mean? A new model? Or that Tesla will run their own robotaxi fleet (which I think is a bad idea)?", "selftext": "Edit: Sorry but my title isn't clear. I meant to focus on the topic of whether you think it's a good idea for Tesla to operate their own robotaxi fleet vs having private operators do it.\n\nTo elaborate why I think it's a bad idea for Tesla to operate their own robotaxi fleet:\n\n\\- Having to manage, maintain, repair, and clean the fleet of cars. Seems like a lot of busy work that doesn't quite fit directly with their company mission.\n\n\\- Having to solve the logistical problem of finding areas to park and charge these EVs. This is probably an even bigger hassle.\n\n(Edit) - Also from a cash flow perspective it is better to sell cars instead of owning them to operate a robotaxi fleet, where the payback period may be many years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the better approach is to sell the dedicated robotaxi EVs to operators who then take on these laborious responsibilities, so that Tesla can focus on scaling. Each private operator could own as few as  a single robotaxi, maintain and clean it, park it in their own garage and charge it when needed. Or they could be mid size businesses that own hundreds of these, whatever the individual market need for a particular locale.\n\nWhat is your opinion on this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(1st post got rejected so I need to type up more words to fulfill the length requirement, so I guess that what I will do here.  1st post got rejected so I need to type up more words to fulfill the length requirement, so I guess that what I will do here. 1st post got rejected so I need to type up more words to fulfill the length requirement, so I guess that what I will do here. 1st post got rejected so I need to type up more words to fulfill the length requirement, so I guess that what I will do here.)", "id": "tz22fz", "created_utc": 1649419691.0, "score": 23, "upvote_ratio": 0.68, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "It\u2019s a new model.
