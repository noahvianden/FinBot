A small percentage is people just canceling and actually going outside or something, the majority are redistributing to other streaming services, which makes sense. Which other services catching up in both content quality and quantity, it's coming down to pricing now - Disney+ alone is $8 a month, bundle that with Hulu and ESPN, with ads for $14 or without ads for $20. Then there's HBO Max, $10 with ads, $15 without ads. Netflix, on the other hand, is all ad-free but imposes limitations, so you can sub for $10 if you don't mind 480p standard definition and only running 1 device at a time. Or $15.50 for 1080p HD and up to 2 devices. But the worst is if you have a 4K TV, and need that ultra HD, or if you have a family, then it's $20 a month, for 4 simultaneous devices, and 4K(only on supported titles).\n\nSo relatively speaking, they're actually profiting substantially less because of not ad-monetizing and only receiving X amount per month per subscriber, whereas the likes of Hulu receives X amount per subscription, plus Y amount from advertisers for ad views, which will aways be relative to bandwidth used as more viewing of ad-related content means more as revenue, and with ad-enabled subscriptions being cheaper, it'll likely always be the dominant subscription variety suggesting higher streaming bandwidth wouldn't be largely caused by ad-free accounts.\n\n\ud83e\udd37", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}], "tickers": ["nflx"], "relates_score": null}, {"body": "Don't sell anything.
