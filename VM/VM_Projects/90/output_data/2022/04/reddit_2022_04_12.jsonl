It keeps people working as they feel they have to pay it off, and it pulls consumption forward. Promotes further chasing of the dollar which provides goods and services to the economy.\n* The PTB also like inflation. Inflation reduces the value of the debt and further dissuades holding cash.\n* Bernanke always talked about the \"[high pressure economy](https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/536691-the-pros-and-cons-of-running-the-economy-hot/)\" where they'd let inflation run hot for a while to make up for the time that was running cool.\n* Interest rates are still massively negative. Inflation at 8.5%. Federal Funds rate at 0.2 percent (real rate: (-8.3)%). US 10 Year at 2.72% (real rate: -(5.78)%). Etc. In 1981, the last time inflation was like this, [rates were significantly positive](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FEDFUNDS).\n* Fed balance sheet still huge, meaning a large amount of money being pumped into the system to maintain its size. And it's actually about [34 billion larger](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20220407/) than a [month ago](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20220303/).\n\nThey're talking very aggressively, like politicians. Inflation is tough on the poors and the Fed's political masters want those votes. But it has little to no impact on the upper middle class and above. And high interest rates, the prescription for inflation, is bad for the stock and real estate markets.\n\nThe Fed's **words** are very anti-inflation. Their **actions** are another thing entirely.\n\nChurchill said, \"[Americans will always do the right thing, only after they have tried everything else.](https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/10/28/241295755/a-churchill-quote-that-u-s-politicians-will-never-surrender)\"  I feel like that's the approach of the Fed regarding inflation, as well.\n\nHow does that translate into positions? Harsh talk to assuage the poors, tepid action intermittently to give the appearance of doing something, but waiting to see what the public opinion polls are saying, and really, if the government gets cleared out after the election, THEN they will get serious about inflation. Otherwise... just keep working down that debt overhang.", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "**tl;dr**: Fed: \"We'll threaten. If the market doesn't tighten, we'll do a rate hike, maybe half a percent at the May meeting, if they're not taking us seriously. If they're still not taking us seriously, we start tepid balance sheet runoff at the June or July meetings and see how that goes. Deep down, we really think - hope - inflation is going to take care of itself, even though demand is higher than it was before the pandemic, and that's likely due to the stimulus.\"\n\nSo they say \"Don't fight the Fed.\" But because the Fed's actions are at odds with its words, there's some confusion, at least on my part. Because, [here's a chart of CPI](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm). **Inflation took off a year ago** \\- it was 4.2% in April 2021.

Brainard did not make it clear where she stood on that point and was not asked directly about it during the moderated question-and-answer session that followed her prepared remarks\"\n* She said balance sheet runoff could begin as early as May. JPow said July.\n* They have been talking very aggressively. From the Bloomberg link above, Brainerd was reported as saying: \"She spent much of her remarks describing how inflation has diverse impacts across income brackets, with lower-earning households spending 77% of their income on necessities versus 31% for higher-income households.\"  Or as Bill Clinton would have put it, \"[Ah feel yore pain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAO4YHBpPyU&t=78s)\".\n\nWhat happens if the economy goes into recession before they really get started with any tightening?

Between February and March, the Company repurchased 9,952,803 shares of their Common Stock pursuant to several of their Forward Share Purchase Agreements. In their own words 'as a result of these repurchases, the amount of Common Stock trading freely on NYSE may be reduced, which could have a material effect on the liquidity of our Common Stock.' Assuming that the shares cannot be sold back into the market and warrant holders do not exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, that ***leaves the tradable float at 1,048,504.***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere\u2019s a paragraph substantiating forward purchase agreements to reduce float from [s1/a](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001836981/000119312522093723/d271170ds1a.htm)\n\n>\\> On February 22, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with the Glazer Investors and Meteora Investors to terminate each of their respective FPAs and redeem the associated shares, which resulted in the Company repurchasing 5.0 million shares for $50,625, or $10.125 per share. These shares were repurchased using restricted cash that was held in escrow at the date of the Merger. In March 2022, the Company repurchased approximately 2.5 million shares from the Highbridge Investors to terminate their respective FPAs and redeem the associated shares. The Company paid $24,901, or $10.15 per share, to repurchase these shares. These shares were repurchased using restricted cash that was held in escrow at the date of the Merger. On February 23, 2022, the Tenor Investors exercised their right to sell to the Company approximately 2.5 million shares which constituted all shares held by the Tenor Investors. As of the end of the first quarter of 2022, the Company repurchased all of these shares using restricted cash that was held in escrow at the date of the Merger.\n\nThe option chain is loaded. **Current OI - 15c alone has 130% of the entire float ITM, 12.5c are barely 35% hedged, <10% move in commons would mean almost half the float would need to be hedged when 12.5c go itm**.
