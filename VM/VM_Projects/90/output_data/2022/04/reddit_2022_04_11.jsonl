But probably not for the reason you think you did.\n\nThe Jan 2024 $40 strike is currently at 95 delta, so it should be moving more-or-less at a 95/100 ratio with the underlying. If the underlying goes up or down $2/share, then the contract moves $1.90 the same direction. Delta isn't constant, generally speaking, delta on an in-the-money call gets smaller as the trike gets closer to being at the money. So for every dollar the underlying goes down, the value of the contract goes down a little less each time, and for every dollar it goes up, it goes up a little more (until it hits 1:1 at a theoretical 100 delta). This is good for you.\n\nYour contact is dated far enough out that you have plenty of time for things to go back your way. So even though you're down now, you have over a year to be right. If your investment thesis is sound and the market cooperates, then you're fine.\n\nWhere I think you screwed up is not so much in the AMD play, but in putting a lot of money into something you don't understand well enough, and that's probably too large a position for you. You have time to hold the contracts for a bit to learn a little more about LEAPS, how they work, and how to manage them (again assuming your investment thesis is sound) so that's not a huge problem.\n\nWhat I do see as a big problem though, is that you're lost enough to be worried when the underlying has only moved  about 2%.

From March 29 to now it's lost more than the market as the market drops.  That's what growth stocks do.

Your thesis isn't totally implausible, but if you want to try a leap, I would definitely buy one or two very cheap contracts equaling maybe 200-$400 and leave it at that. My rule of thumb is if that money vanishes tomorrow, will it hurt you? If so, don't spend it on options. Because THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING YOU WERENT CONSIDERING THAT MESSES UP THE TRADE.
