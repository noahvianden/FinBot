{"title": "Are rating agencies incompetent or am I an idiot?", "selftext": "After some red flags I started taking a thorough look at ESG ratings and credit ratings for car companies. Still in a very early phase, but I want to share my results.\n\nFirst I collected ESG data from two notable ESG rating agencies (MSCI & Sustainalytics) for 15 notable automotive companies with available data. When I calculated the correlation with each other they were not correlated (anti-correlated if anything, Pearson -0.25, p= 0.37). This indicates to me it is just random noise without intrinsic information.\n\nThen I collected credit rating information from two notable credit rating agencies (Moody's & S&P) for 15 notable automotive companies with available data (same companies used for ESG analysis). These ratings were strongly correlated implying some underlying information (Pearson 0.65, p = 0.008). But when I then ranked these car businesses by their average credit rating Tesla scored the lowest with 2 billion debt, 20 billion cash & 10 billion yearly income. On the other hand business leveraged to the tits & flirting with bankruptcy (Toyota 210 billion debt, 50 billion cash, 20 billion yearly income, General Motors 110 billion debt, 20 billion cash, 10 billion yearly income) were scoring higher.\n\nI realize more data can be collected and the numbers can be cherry-picked for a brighter picture, but overall this initial result paint a black and white picture: ratings = bullshit. What am I missing?\n\nThanks redditors! :)\n\nEDIT1: I have gotten a lot of feedback on things that are missing & an interest in nuance. \n\nI agree there's is a lot that can be done, my original plan was about 1000x more ambitious.

If demand is soft for luxury (there's a lot of good competition from Mercedes and BMW coming), Toyota can refocus on more popular options like the Prius. Tesla can't react very fast to changes in the market (where's the roadster that people pre-paid or the cybertruck?) \n\nGood point. I would nuance this a lot with some details (if you are interested): Yearly running cost for evs are very low and with margins on model 3/y very high they could be cheaper than Prius overall to a consumer and still be profitable to Tesla. Also, tesla has shown some ability to move quick in crises. In the chip shortage they rewrote software in house for a variety of alternatives quickly while competitors were forced to cut much more heavily in production. I am confident tesla can move as the wind if necessary. Delays in models were not due to inability but prioritization of batteries/chips for other vehicles, if those wouldn't sell it would be a different story.\n\n>The last time, they got a big government bail out. Creditors were made whole. These companies are too big to fail and creditors can count on that. Tesla is not.\n\nPartially agree. With Biden at the wheel GM is government supported and Tesla seems to be disliked. This may change though, both the government and the being to big to fail. But most importantly creditors were not made whole. In chapter 11 bankruptcy creditors lose a lot of money; just not every last bit.\n\n>It matters how. If the repaying of debts comes from issuing new shares and diluting equity, their 50% drop in market cap makes that practice not sustainable. The big auto companies need to pay debts either with their margins or government assistance, as issuing shares is not an option for them.\n\nAs far as I am aware at the moment of Tesla's switch from losing money to massive profitability the choice to pay off debt and not take on debt was made completely. I don't see why you are focused on issuing shares, I can't find anything on that being the major source.\n\nOn the other hand, General Motors and Toyota do not seem make such decisions, their debt often grows while they are making profits. Some of the profits may be reinvested; something I referred to as 'leveraging up to the tits' but to be certain this would required some detailed understanding of the accounting practices.\n\n>Why? Their job is to analyze how an entity would make creditors whole. If Tesla doesn't have a track record that's back by more than issuing shares to repay debt, why would the agencies advise their clients to lend money to Tesla?\n\nMy point was that if a company is not issuing debt right now and the rating becomes unreliable due to lack of effort, a competent agency would simply remove the inacurrate rating. If their track record is paying of debt agencies should advice clients to be willing to lend money, that's simple. \n\nI can't find anything about this only paying of debt by issuing shares.
