{"title": "Tesla DD: The Reverse WSB Chipotle Signal Has been Hit, and Other Catalysts Incoming", "selftext": "No fluff, just stuff here. We all know the bad, ya'll can't stop talking about it. Let's look at a few important metrics that will send Tesla to the moon:\n\n## The Chipotle P/E \n\n[Tesla's trailing P/E is now lower than Chipotle's](https://twitter.com/TeslaPodcast/status/1602365046369259532). We are officially at the **Burrito Bottom**, which many experts have noted is a significant indicator for a bull run. \n\n## The Reverse WSB\n\nThis is a bullish note based on general sentiment on /r/wsb. Many comments about $168 being the 'top', 'load up on puts', 'the competition is coming', 'Tesla is going down the drain'. \n\nThese are the same people who probably bought $1300c when Tesla was close to $1200 (pre-split). We here at /u/grizzly_teddy believe that this high negative sentiment is a strong indicator of a bull run, similar to the Reverse Jim Kramer, although slightly less reliable of a metric. \n\n## Future Catalysts\n\nNow that we have put aside the most important indicators, now we can list a few catalysts. \n\n* **Stock buyback**. Many rumors regarding buyback. With Tesla's projected cashflow and their existing cash, low stock price, recent 'critical meeting', and the 1% tax going into effect on Jan 1st, a stock buyback in the next week is likely. We here at /u/grizzly_teddy give this a 37.6% chance of happening. \n\n* **Q4 deliveries and earnings**. Despite small price cuts, Tesla will hit record deliveries and profits this quarter. This will officially lower the trailing P/E to 40x if current stock price holds, which we believe is far too low for a company growing profit between 50-100% per year. \n\n* **Gigafactory announcement**. Was supposed to be announced this year. 50/50 if it is announced before EoY. Likely locations are Canada/Mexico/Indonesia/UK. This will be a nice catalyst. \n\n* **Model 3 'Highland'**. Model 3 update coming soon, not too much is known, but this will certainly be a nice development, although we believe this will only contribute 1.83% to the stock price. \n\n* **Twitter Overhang**. This will get better, not worse. Not much to say here, but people will see Tesla hit Q4 goals and profits despite Elon being involved with Twitter. Twitter overhand accounts for at least $40-$50 in the current stock price. \n\n* **Super mega record breaking crazy Q1**. New subsidies will add significant demand and profit to Tesla's bottom line. Combined with a NA Gigafactory announcement, Tesla profit projects will be re-worked and Tesla will be given a higher multiple by the market. \n\n* **Cybertruck**. Mid 2023. This will be huge. Big margins. Insane demand. Will take time to ramp, but the Cybertruck hitting the street will be a big catalyst. \n\n* **FSD**. Non-beta FSD will come. One day. For now, we here at /u/grizzly_teddy do not add FSD to our evaluation. Could come in 2023. Or 2024. \n\n* **New Model**. This could be a robotaxi, a new smaller Model 3. What we do know is that Tesla is working on a completely new car that will be significantly cheaper than the Model 3. This will be a huge catalyst. However we have no idea when this will be announced. \n\n* **Tesla Energy**. No one talks about Tesla Energy, but they are growing the energy business at a rate of 200-300% per year. Megapacks will bring in billions in profit. Every quarter will be a surprise, as analysts have given the energy business an assumption of zero profit. Tesla is able to utilize lower cost LFP batteries for their megapacks, and their ability to scale their production is far greater than their ability to scale cars. Thus, Tesla Energy will be assigned a higher multiple than the car business in 2023 (as it should). By the end of 2023, Tesla Energy should get a multiple of 100x on the trailing 4Qs. By our estimates, that means by the end of next year **Tesla Energy will be worth $100-200 billion**. \n\n* **Tesla Semi**. Tesla stock has not realized gains on profits that Tesla Semi will generate. Demand and usability is still not understood by the wider market. The demand/profit of Tesla Semi will be realized in the stock next year, especially once sales/pre-orders are announced along with pricing, and the Semi statistics are confirmed by a third party. \n\n* **Attention Elon**. Elon once less involved with Twitter, will spend more time talking about Tesla and Tesla future products, which will push the stock price higher. \n\n* **GM/Ford Failures**. We anticipate poor financials for the next two years from these companies, as they lose ICE sales and ramp up EV production, while losing money on their EVs. These companies are piling up inventory, and are in for a rough ride as they spend the next 3-4 years getting to Tesla's current level of production. \n\n## Bottom Line\n\n$350 by 04/31/2023. $500 by 01/31/204. Bottom is now, or sometime in the next few days.  \n\n*Disclosure: [my current positions, currently my entire portfolio](https://i.imgur.com/92akQjB.png)\n\n*Edit: Obviously a fed pivot is another catalyst, but that's unpredictable and not Tesla-specific.", "id": "zkhvb1", "created_utc": 1670893815.0, "score": 45, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|408|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|8 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: Tesla bottom is now.
