{"title": "Buy Silvergate Capital ($SI)", "selftext": "\n\n***Thesis*** \n\nSilvergate Capital ($SI) is undervalued. Fears of Silvergate's possible exposure to FTX as well as related legal scrutiny have caused a decline in share price, offering an opportunity to capitalize on irrational market pessimism. \n\nSilvergate Capital is a good business in a good financial position and this discrepancy in value offers an attractive point of entry. \n\nThe business has been profitable for the last 20+ years. Silvergate has a strong balance sheet, growing net income, and is cash flow positive. As of December 23, Silvergate is trading at 40% of its book value. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Company Overview*** \n\nSilvergate is a bank centered within the digital asset industry. \n\nWhat puts them apart from other banks is the Silvergate Exchange Network (SEN), which enables customers to send USD and Euros 24/7 between customer and client accounts. Both parties must bank with Silvergate to use the network. \n\nBesides SEN, Silvergate operates the same as a typical bank, deriving its income through the spread between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities - the liabilities mainly being customer deposits. \n\nSilvergate's customers consist of institutional investors, digital currency exchanges, and businesses that operate within the digital asset industry. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Share Price Decline and FTX Controversy*** \n\nSilvergate Capital has declined 90% YTD, largely attributable to an overall decline in cryptocurrencies. \n\nThe stock's more recent descent has stemmed from controversies surrounding Silvergate's possible exposure to FTX. FTX was a customer of Silvergate, and it was unclear how big their deposits were with the bank, or if the exchange had any outstanding debts owed to Silvergate. \n\nAlan Lane, CEO of Silvergate cleared these concerns in a press release saying that *\u201cSilvergate has no outstanding loans to nor investments in FTX\u201d* and that *\u201cour relationship with FTX is limited to deposits.\u201d* Of those deposits, *\u201cFTX represented less than 10%\u201d.* \n\nFTX\u2019s deposits in Silvergate are about $1B. This will impact the bank's total customer deposits but shows that the decline in share price over exposure fears was not justified by a real loss of value to the business. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Silvergate Regulatory Scrutiny*** \n\nAnother contributor to the stock's decline has been regulatory scrutiny involving Silvergate's role in FTX\u2019s transfer of funds to Alameda. Lawmakers including Elizabeth Warren claim that Silvergate should have detected suspicious transactional activity between FTX and Alameda. Silvergate is being placed at the center of the conflict with senators implying that Silvergate holds some responsibility for the loss of customer funds by failing to detect FTX\u2019s suspicious activity. \n\nSilvergate responded, saying that they conduct effective \u201cdue diligence and monitoring\u201d into all their customers as well as \u201cdetermine the beneficial owner, the source of funds, and the purpose and expected use of funds\u201d for every account with the bank. \n\nWhile lawmakers are looking for a scapegoat correlated with Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s fraud, the probability that Silvergate holds any responsibility for FTX\u2019s mismanagement of funds is very low. Silvergate conducted all its vetting practices under the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act. Detecting suspicious activity past the standard practices that all banks are required to act on is an unrealistic expectation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Bearish Sentiment*** \n\nAs of December 12, Silvergate\u2019s short interest is 40%. That is incredibly high and indicates the immense bearish sentiment surrounding the bank. It is logical to assume that the overall pessimism towards Silvergate is due to the above reasons. \n\nI want to emphasize that the reasons stated above have had very little effect on the fundamentals of the business. In fact, while Silvergate's market cap has been decreasing, very little has changed in the business. \n\nBefore Silvergate's decline, it was a good business with a moderate to high-priced valuation. Now during this decline, Silvergate is a good business, except trading ridiculously cheap. Extreme bearish sentiment that correlates FTX\u2019s demise to Silvergates is causing an innate discrepancy between fundamental value and public valuation. \n\n   \n\n***The Balance Sheet*** \n\nAs of September 30, 2022, Silvergate Capital has 1.9B in Cash and $15.5B in Total Assets. The majority of Silvergates assets are highly liquid in case of customer withdrawals. \n\nThe company has $14.1B in total liabilities as well with $13.3B of that being total deposits from customers. All in all, **shareholder equity is 1.3b, well over** ***double*** **Silvergate's market cap of $520M**. The mean p/b of publicly traded banks is 1.5. \n\n**Cash & Cash Equivalents are $1.8B, triple Silvergates market cap** as well. Retained earnings have increased by $100M YOY. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Income*** \n\nSilvergate is a cash-producing business that is consistently returning value to shareholders. Their income is derived from the spread between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. \n\nTheir net interest spread was .12% for the nine months ended September 2022. This is a decline from .24% YOY in 2021. The spread is small but generates high earnings as interest-earning assets are $15.3B. \n\nI want to stress the point that interest income is extremely high relative to market cap and stockholder equity. \n\nSilvergate Capital returned $100M to shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. That is *20%* of Silvergate\u2019s market cap, a p/e of 5. \n\nNet income has more than doubled in the past two years and Silvergate continues to return value every quarter. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Macro Factors*** \n\nAs the Fed raises rates to mitigate inflation, a high interest-rate environment proves highly advantageous to Silvergate. According to their earnings presentation, *\u201cfor each +25bps increase in interest rates, net interest income is estimated to increase approximately $16 million over a 12- month period\u201d*. \n\n63% of their interest-earning assets are an adjustable rate. As interest rates increase, the spread will yield higher net income.   \n\nThe other 40% of interest-earning assets are hedged through fixed interest rates to reduce income volatility from interest rate fluctuations. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Conclusion and TLDR;***\n\nAll in all, I believe Silvergate Capitals' market cap of $520M is far below its true fundamental value. Stockholder equity alone is more than double its market cap and the bank returns significant value to shareholders every quarter giving a p/e of 5. A rising interest rate environment will only amplify the banks success.\n\nEdit: Okay okay fuck I was wrong.. for now\u2026", "id": "zv4c13", "created_utc": 1671995255.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.44, "num_comments": 103, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|6|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|39|**Previous Best DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/z2bu1r/buy_puts_on_aehr/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/x9f0k2/buy_puts_on_alaunos_therapeutics_tcrt/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xb12ki/buy_puts_on_nextdecade_next/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xb0p11/buy_puts_on_nextdecade_next/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/zv4c13/buy_silvergate_capital_si/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)\n>TL;DR: - Silvergate Capital is a bank centered within the digital asset industry.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Good bot", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14441068470478058}, {"body": "Lame, Visual Mod is getting pathetic.
