{"title": "Predicting S&P 500 using VIX", "selftext": "Guys since trying to predict the S&P 500 is really hard to do consistently, then why not just use the VIX. I learned that the VIX and the S&P 500 are almost perfectly negatively correlated, so why not just try to predict the VIX instead. To add on, most people say that short term price movement is based on human psychology (traders emotion) so why not take advantage of that and predict the VIX. Since the VIX shows the status of the current emotion (fear) then why not try to predict the fear, that the S&P 500 then almost follows perfectly. \n\nWhy not use technical analysis on the VIX to see for example at what price people get scared at I guess. This has definitely been done before but I haven't seen it anywhere which got me confused. Of why not use technical analysis on the VIX then use technical analysis on the S&P 500 to confirm a trade entry etc.", "id": "zpdk15", "created_utc": 1671411475.0, "score": 10, "upvote_ratio": 0.61, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|0|**First Seen In WSB**|1 month ago\n**Total Comments**|3|**Previous Best DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n\n ^^[**Discord**](http://discord.gg/wsbverse) ^^[BanBets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/banbets/)  ^^VoteBot ^^[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/votebot/) ^^[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/leaderboard/) ^^- ^^[**Keep_VM_Alive**](https://www.patreon.com/visualmod)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1369549036026001}, {"body": "Would you give up on this idea if you learned that VIX and S&P 500 are not NOT perfectly negatively correlated?", "score": 58, "replies": [{"body": "Isn\u2019t the R squared about 0.7 meaning it\u2019s correlated almost 70% of the time", "score": 11, "replies": [{"body": "Too many holes in this theory:\n\nalmost 70% is never considered \u201cperfect\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s also based on historical data and before the short term options exploded in recent years.", "score": 16, "replies": [{"body": "But I\u2019ve also entertained theories that the VIX is being artificially suppressed to serve political aims.

I think the Marketmakers needed to find a way to break up a herd who would pile in on a specific strike. By making every day zero day options they could have everybody Pio in on 408 on Monday and 410 on Tuesday and 407 on Wednesday and they could weave their hedging through those strikes more easily than if max pain went from 405 on Monday to 415 on Friday.
