They are not the traditional sleeper we associate with a semi. The shape and structure are very misleading in this regard. The average accident involving a heavy vehicle in the unites states for 2021 was $148,279. Now imagine your semi is a Tesla, a $400,000 dollar vehicle. More than twice the price of a typical day cab. Insurance premiums for fleets are above $20,000 per vehicle as is. If you started adding vehicles to your fleet that are driven by the worst drivers in the industry, it is guaranteed your premiums would be considerably higher. I say this because the drivers with the lowest turnover and insurance premiums are long distance drivers and non traditional loads(heavy spec, flat deck, step deck, drop frame\u2026 etc.\n\nThe end of the day corporations only care about ROI. In transport the margins are razor thin. If a Tesla provides a better ROI than traditional manufacturers, I could understand the hype surrounding this vehicle.\n\nEdit.
