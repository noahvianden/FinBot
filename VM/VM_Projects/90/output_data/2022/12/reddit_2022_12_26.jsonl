{"title": "Vail Resorts Inc. (MTN) Stock Review 12/26/22", "selftext": "   As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions and hope to have a civil discussion. \n\n\u00b7 **Company Description**\n\no ELI5 the company\u2019s business model\n\n\u00a7 Vail operates 41 mountain resorts across 8 geographic regions, most of which are in North America. As of their most recent 10-K 88% of revenue comes from mountains and the remaining 12% comes from lodging.\n\n\u00b7 **Company Soundness**\n\no How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?\n\n\u00a7 Revenue is cyclical and seasonal. Seasonal sales tend to peak during the winter season as you would expect. To guard against seasonality Vail leverages their large network of regional with their Epic Pass. This Pass is purchased prior to ski season at a discount but allows for its holders to use many of their owned mountains. Roughly 60% of their lift ticket sales come from the Epic Pass program. This allows Vail to collect revenue in advance of expenses and mitigate the seasonality of their business as the customer is taking the weather risk.\n\n\u00a7 Revenue from the mountain region is from lift tickets, ski school, dining and equipment rental.\n\n\u00a7 On their resorts are hotels, this revenue is captured in their lodging division.\n\n\u00a7 Finally, they have a real estate development division that build and sell real estate around the immediate mountain area.\n\no Do they operate with significant leverage?\n\n\u00a7 Vail does operate with a fairly significant amounts of leverage. They operate with $2.41 of debt for every $1 in equity. Additionally, their interest coverage ratio is fairly low at 4.1x which is probably calculated on peak earnings/margins in the short term. While this debt is somewhat substantial, they are buying hard assets, mountains, and mountain businesses.\n\n\u00a7 $1 billion of their $2.8 billion of debt is in a revolver that matures in 2026 with terms of 1.35% + SOFR, currently 5.08% as of 10/31/22.\n\no Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?\n\n\u00a7 Somewhat. As mentioned, they do carry a fairly significant debt load. Having said that they currently have $1.2 billion in cash with and additional $416.5 million available to them in a revolver.\n\n\u00a7 Even during a stress test as significant as COVID in FY 2020 and 2021 (FY ends in July), Vail remained profitable, albeit significantly less so.\n\n\u00a7 Given the access to capital, cash on hand and past financial performance of covid, I am comfortable with their balance sheet in a downturn. Still not in love with it, however.\n\n\u00b7 **Can it be Replicated?**\n\no Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, Vail has nature barriers to entry, literally. Mountains don\u2019t tend to spring up overnight, clear the land and permitting hurdles to develop and then attract enough customers to run a successful resort is quite a difficult hurdle to overcome.\n\no Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, while Vail\u2019s operations tend to be lumpy, they are consistently strong. Vail has been profitable over each of the last 9 years and over the past 5 has average ROEs of 16%. If we exclude FY 2020 and 2021 (COVID), ROEs have averaged about 22%.\n\n\u00a7 Free cash flow margins are consistently between 16% to 20% excluding COVID times but were still positive during covid.\n\no What is the competitive advantage?\n\n\u00a7 In my view the advantage of Vail is high barriers to entry from a bottleneck in the supply of mountains that will likely persist. Getting a mountain up and running is difficult. You either have to buy or lease the land. You need to develop the mountain, build the lifts and get the permitting to do all of the above. This not only requires a significant amount of capital and time which does not typically cause investment. Finally, you need to get the customers in. It is a large capital investment upfront that has a lengthy development time. Even if you get through all those hurdles, what do you do if your region suffers from warm weather during ski season? In my view all these factors will likely limit the supply of new mountains on a permanent basis. That is not to say we will never see a new mountain resort, just that they will be slow to develop and infrequent. I tested this thesis by looking at the number of ski resorts in the US over time. From 1990 to 2020. The number has steadily fallen from 569 to 462. [https://www.statista.com/statistics/206534/number-of-ski-resorts-operating-in-the-us-since-1990/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206534/number-of-ski-resorts-operating-in-the-us-since-1990/) \n\n\u00a7 As it pertains to Vail specifically, their vast scale and diversified geographical footprint helps to steady much of the peaks and troughs in the cycle. Additionally, scale gives them the ability to offer services that smaller mom and pop operations would struggle to offer. Sure 3 mom and pops could make their own epic pass to compete, but the income is also getting split 3 ways and so are the operations.\n\no Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, that would be way more capital than Vail has. My bet as mentioned above is that would be competitors would be hard pressed to deploy capital directly in mountain resorts.\n\no Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?\n\n\u00a7 Any developer worth their salt can cut down some trees and clear land. But it takes more than that to be successful with a mountain resort.\n\no Are there competitive threats on the horizon?\n\n\u00a7 Main threats are global warming which could make some or all of their mountain locations for expensive to operate through snow development.\n\n\u00a7 Vail has a meager presence in the most competitive mountain resort environment, Europe. As growth outside this slows, returns may drop should they feel compelled to enter a more densely supplied area.\n\n\u00a7 Changes in entertainment preference. Mountains are simply one form of entertainment. Technically skiing can lose market share to Netflix, birdhouse making or anything else.\n\n\u00b7 **Growth**\n\no Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?\n\n\u00a7 Yes, outside of COVID, Vail has steadily grown revenue and earnings.\n\no Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?\n\n\u00a7 I believe so, even if acquisitions should slow, the regional dominance of their mountains and ability to undercut the market with the Epic Pass gives them lasting pricing power in my view.\n\n\u00b7 **Watch List Decision**\n\no Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision? \n\n\u00a7 I feel I do.\n\no Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?\n\n\u00a7 Yes\n\n\u00b7 **Valuation**\n\no Value the company\n\n\u00a7 Revenue for FY \u201922 (ended July 22) was $2.525 billion\n\n\u00a7 Analyst Forecasts for FY \u201925 revenue is $3.296 billion or a 9.29% CAGR\n\n\u00a7 Analyst forecasts for FY \u201928 revenues are $3.423 or a CAGR of 1.27% from \u201925 to \u201928. MTN is a smaller company and less followed by analysts. I feel this is far too low given that outside of COVID, in the last 10 years, excluding COVID, rev growth was never less than 5.5% and ranged between 5.5% to 19.%, mostly around 10%.\n\n\u00a7 To that end, I am going to assume 8% growth in revenue going forward. I will use a 25% downside in the 3-year estimate to model a recession and a 10% premium to model the bull case. I also down Vail will have a 3 year growth period of 1%, I feel that modeling an 8% growth rate perpetually at this point is still fair.\n\n\u00a7 Over the past 5 years, buybacks have been meager. For a share count I will assume a -1% to 0% CAGR in shares.\n\n\u00a7 Free Cash Flow margins have typically ranged 15 to 20%. I will assume the same going forward.\n\n\u00a7 MTN has declared a dividend of $1.91. I will assume this stays constant over the next 3 years.\n\n\u00a7 Outside of Covid, FCF Yields have ranged between 3.6% to 6.3% in the past 10 years. Going forward I will assume a 3.75% to 6% yield in 2025.\n\n\u00a7 Putting it all together gives me an estimated value in 2025 of $236.64 to $297.04 per share for a midpoint of $266.84. With a current share price of $241.06, the implied CAGR over the next 3-years is a meager 4.39%. The bull and bear case imply CAGRs of 8.77% to -0.29% per year.\n\no Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?\n\n\u00a7 Probably not. The travel industry is firing on all cylinders and a recession is looming meaning that current financials are likely at a near-term peak. Given the current rate environment and risks in the business, I feel it would be fair to earn 12% on an investment in Vail. If we discount the midpoint value in 2025 and include the dividends, Vail would need to be purchased below $207 or a loss of 14% from these levels to expect a 12% return at this time.\n\nSources:\n\nAggregated Data: [https://finbox.com/NYSE:MTN](https://finbox.com/NYSE:MTN) \n\n10-Q: [https://investors.vailresorts.com/static-files/f789fe7b-b3db-4cec-990e-b105395933af](https://investors.vailresorts.com/static-files/f789fe7b-b3db-4cec-990e-b105395933af) \n\n10-K: [https://investors.vailresorts.com/static-files/f8907a47-9da4-4d63-be19-84e981f1b268](https://investors.vailresorts.com/static-files/f8907a47-9da4-4d63-be19-84e981f1b268) \n\nCurrently long MTN", "id": "zvr5oq", "created_utc": 1672073357.0, "score": 75, "upvote_ratio": 0.85, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "I\u2019ve read about similar companies, such as FUN, who appear to have a significant moat in that their resorts/attractions are hard to replicate.

It\u2019s a bottom line publicly traded company that has no personality, no fun, and could care less about anything other than their stock price.\nSo for me I buy their shitty ass stock as much as I can afford every time it hits around $200. V**L will succeed at all costs, V**L  doesn\u2019t care about anything or anyone. Customers are limited by where they ski. Their model absolutely sucks but they are here to stay. Not that Costco is the go to model but stealing some of that type of MoJo would amazing. Morale has no part in V**L\u2019s business plans. The Ebenezer Scrounge business plan from,  R*b*rt K*tz. V**L does suck the soul out of the quaint ski towns and they will continue to succeed at it. \nSo make the best of it and don\u2019t let it bring down the stoke. Share your thoughts with the tourists. Shine some perspective without the anger and end all mentality. Enjoy the season don\u2019t spend your dollars on the mountain. Seek out local rental shops, bars and restaurants. Don\u2019t go for the V**L points BS. Like Disney they want all your vacation dollars to stay with V**L. Spend elsewhere, don\u2019t stay at a V**L resort property, seek out the local businesses in each ski town. Caution though you may find actual characters/employees who care. \nGreat write up on the MTN stock, like I said I\u2019m an owner and only because it personally eases the burden of dealing with these zombie corporate asshats.", "score": 2, "replies": [{"body": "Good luck betting on the ski industry.
