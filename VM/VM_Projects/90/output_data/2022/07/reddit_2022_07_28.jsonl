Seriously, don't follow this trade, it's at best got like a 30% chance of not going to zero.  The theory (negative GDP print tomorrow followed by big misses on AMZN and AAPL after hours) is sound, but the positions are ridiculous.\n\n2 shares SQQQ\n\n1 SPY 9/16 235p\n\n2 SPY 9/16 200p\n\n3 AAPL 7/29 133p\n\n1 AMZN 7/29 102p\n\n1 AMZN 8/5 98p\n\n1 SPY 8/3 362p\n\n3 SPY 8/19 315p\n\n2 DOG 8/19 41c\n\n1 DOG 8/19 50c\n\n(total current value $235, so I'm already down some from that big rally today, will probably be down more by end of day tomorrow)\n\nIf the market crashes on Friday, I'm a genius, if it doesn't, I'm out half my junked truck $$.  What's going to happen?  Nobody knows!  Feel free to dump on my ass if this doesn't work out, because I'll be crowing to the fucking sky gods if it does.\n\n**EDIT: haha.  Did i say Black Friday?
