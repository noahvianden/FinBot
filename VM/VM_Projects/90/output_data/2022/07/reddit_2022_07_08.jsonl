{"title": "Twitter Is Ready For A Legal Battle To Force Elon Musk To Buy The Company.", "selftext": "Mr. Musk has appeared reluctant to proceed with the $44 billion agreement, citing uncertainty about the number of fake accounts on the platform.\n\nElon Musk may be preparing for the next chapter in his Twitter takeover journey: court.\n\nA $44 billion deal was reached in April between Mr. Musk and Twitter, and the two sides have since been working to close the deal. Mr. Musk requested information on how many Twitter accounts are bots, and Twitter has provided Mr. Musk access to its \u201cfirehose,\u201d or stream of tweets. It has continued to share additional information with him.\n\nOn Thursday, The Washington Post reported that the deal was in jeopardy, and that Mr. Musk\u2019s team was \u201cexpected to take potentially drastic action.\u201d The article\u2019s claims, which could not be confirmed by the DealBook newsletter, took Twitter and its advisers by surprise, because they did not consider the deal to be in any further peril than at any other point in recent months.\n\nMr. Musk did not respond to a request for a comment. Twitter reiterated that it intended \u201cto close the transaction and enforce the merger agreement at the agreed price and terms.\u201d\n\nThere are many \u201cdrastic\u201d actions Mr. Musk could take, but as it pertains to the deal, there are two clear possibilities: He could deliver a letter to Twitter saying he is terminating the deal, and he could sue Twitter. Those two actions would most likely, but not necessarily, happen simultaneously.\n\nThere are no clear grounds for Mr. Musk to try to break the deal, because Twitter has publicly disclosed that roughly 5 percent of its users are bots since it went public. But he may try to claim that this disclosure is intentionally misleading, a very high bar to meet legally.\n\nThere are many \u201cdrastic\u201d actions Mr. Musk could take, but as it pertains to the deal, there are two clear possibilities: He could deliver a letter to Twitter saying he is terminating the deal, and he could sue Twitter. Those two actions would most likely, but not necessarily, happen simultaneously.\n\nThere are no clear grounds for Mr. Musk to try to break the deal, because Twitter has publicly disclosed that roughly 5 percent of its users are bots since it went public. But he may try to claim that this disclosure is intentionally misleading, a very high bar to meet legally.\n\nThe stakes are high. The most valuable part of Twitter right now is its acquisition agreement with Mr. Musk. Its shares are down about 24 percent since April, and trade well below the price agreed with Mr. Musk. Twitter\u2019s stock fell 4 percent in premarket trading on Friday.\n\nTwitter is seeing pressure on its advertising business, has frozen hiring and is laying off some staff members. To accept less than the price it originally negotiated with Mr. Musk could expose Twitter to shareholder lawsuits. So while litigation could be costly, losing the deal may be even worse.\n\nSource: [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/business/musk-twitter-deal.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/08/business/musk-twitter-deal.html)\n\n**Elon Musk's Twitter takeover journey continues, but this time, the setting might be in court.

That\u2019s not nearly enough", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "First, the [breakup fee agreed to in the merger agreement is two-way](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/26/technology/twitter-musk-breakup-fee.html). Twitter would owe Elon the breakup fee if it breached or decided to sell to another buyer before close. \n\nSecond, the merger contemplated in the agreement is contingent on several factors including debt to be provided by the lenders identified in the funding letter. If the lenders do not fund Elon doesn't have to close nor would he owe Twitter the breakup fee. FWIW the lenders won't fund if Elon doesn't want to do the deal. \n\nThird, the company has represented that they 'think' the number of spam/bot accounts are less than 5%. But if the company actually has information that contradicts this 5% number they are guilty of fraud. There are plenty of current and former Twitter employees who claim that the company's own data shows a LOT more than 5%. But as you note, that will be a fact issue to be determined by a judge/jury.\n\nI wrote about this in detail with quotes from the agreement here: [https://politiquerepublic.substack.com/p/could-twitter-force-elon-musk-to](https://politiquerepublic.substack.com/p/could-twitter-force-elon-musk-to) \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBased on the Merger Agreement, the billionaire known as Elon Musk is not actually buying Twitter. In fact, the eventual owner (if the deal goes through) would be X Holdings I, Inc. which is presently controlled by Elon Musk. Currently, the entity only has a few assets including the actual Merger Agreement with Twitter, a \u2018parent guarantee\u2019 for part of the breakup fee (>$1B)9, and an \u201cEquity Financing Commitment\u201d from Elon Musk (discussed below). If a Delaware Chancery Court forced X Holdings I, Inc. to buy Twitter it would be unable to do so as it lacks the capital to fund the transaction - but there is more to the story.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecognizing this, Twitter asked Musk to provide a personal guarantee to X Holdings I in some amount less than the $1B reverse breakup fee.10 The Merger Agreement references the \u2018Parent Guarantee\u2019 in Section 5.10:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSection 5.10 Parent Guarantee: Parent has furnished the Company with a true, complete and correct copy of the Parent Guarantee. The Parent Guarantee is in full force and effect and has not been amended, modified or terminated. The Parent Guarantee is a (i) legal, valid and binding obligation of the Guarantor and of each of the parties thereto and (ii) enforceable in accordance with its respective terms against the Guarantor and each of the other parties thereto. There is no default under the Parent Guarantee by the Guarantor, and no event has occurred that with the lapse of time or the giving of notice or both would constitute a default thereunder by the Guarantor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn conjunction with the Merger Agreement, Elon Musk delivered X Holdings I (the \u201cParent\u201d) an \u201cEquity Financing Commitment\u201d letter11 that defined Elon Musk or his assigns as the \u201cEquity Investor\u201d. In the letter, the \u201cEquity Investor\u201d agreed to provide the equity portion of the purchase price - $33.5 billion of $44 billion \u201cAggregate Equity Commitment\u201d - to the Parent under certain conditions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn my review of the letter several of the conditions included by Musk convince me that there is no realistic way, the court could force Elon Musk to provide $33.5 billion in cash to the Parent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf Elon Musk announced he did not want to buy Twitter, the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters would immediately terminate. There isn\u2019t a bank on the planet that would lend $10.5 billion to the Parent if Elon Musk wasn\u2019t interested in buying Twitter. And the agreement makes it clear the banks have NO obligation to any of the parties. Under the terms of the Equity Financing Commitment letter, the Equity Investor (aka Elon Musk) does not have ANY obligation to fund any amount over $33.5 billion as outlined in Section 1(b):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding anything else to the contrary in this letter agreement, the Equity Investor (together with his assigns) shall not have any obligation under any circumstances to contribute to, or otherwise provide to, Parent, directly or indirectly, funds in an amount in excess of the Aggregate Equity Commitment\u2026\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, even if Twitter would agree to lower the price to $33.5 billion to \u2018force\u2019 Musk to fund the deal without the additional debt, the terms of the Equity Financing Commitment letter release the Equity Investor from its obligation in the event that the Debt Financing is not provided in Section 1(b)(iii):\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201csubstantially contemporaneous receipt by Parent or Acquisition Sub of the cash proceeds of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters in accordance with the terms and conditions of such Debt Commitment Letters or any Alternative Financing that Parent accepts from alternative sources pursuant to Section 6.10(c) of the Merger Agreement (subject only to the funding of the Aggregate Equity Commitment contemplated by this letter agreement).\u201d  \nTwitter\u2019s DEFA14A further clarifies:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\u201cThe Merger Agreement also provides that Twitter, on one hand, or Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other hand, may specifically enforce the obligations under the Merger Agreement, except that Twitter may only cause Mr. Musk\u2019s equity financing commitment to be funded in circumstances where the conditions to Parent\u2019s and Acquisition Sub\u2019s obligations to consummate the Merger are satisfied and the debt and margin loan financing is funded or available. As described above, if the conditions to Parent\u2019s and Acquisition Sub\u2019s obligations to complete the Merger are satisfied and Parent fails to consummate the Merger as required pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including because the equity, debt and/or margin loan financing is not funded, Parent will be required to pay Twitter a termination fee of $1.0 billion.\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo conclude, if Elon Musk decides not to move forward with the deal the Delaware Chancery Court could not use specific performance to force the billionaire to buy the company UNLESS the banks that agreed to provide X Holdings I, Inc. $10.5 billion in debt (secured by Elon\u2019s personal wealth) and actually fund the deal sending the Parent the money. The court could NOT force the banks to lend money to X Holdings I, Inc. and there is ZERO chance that they would do so if Elon Musk didn\u2019t want to do the deal. So technically, the folks that suggest Elon could be forced to buy Twitter are correct - but in reality, they are most certainly wrong. The deal is not going through under the terms contemplated in the Merger Agreement unless Elon wants it to go through, period.", "score": -1, "replies": [{"body": ">\t FWIW the lenders won\u2019t fund if Elon doesn\u2019t want to do the deal.\n\nThat\u2019s not how that works.

I detail the actual sections of the agreement that make it clear he doesn't have to fund if the lenders don't fund. The lenders do NOT have any obligation to Twitter and their funding commitment letters are subject to diligence AND loan committee approval. If Elon doesn't want to do the deal there is ZERO chance the banks will fund. Twitter can't make them. Twitter's agreement with Musk makes it clear that if they don't fund he doesn't have to close. \n2. If Twitter represented that fewer than 5% of their accounts were bots/spam but knew that the number was greater than 5% they'd be in trouble. That is called fraud. \n3. The DE Chancery Court would be a judge but the  shareholder derivative suit(s) would likely be heard in other jurisdictions where jury trials are the norm. Again, that is why I included the judge/jury. \n4. There are other cases where specific performance has been enforced but they didn't include the 'outs' that Elon has in this case. The whole structure of this deal contemplated a deal whereby Elon WANTED to do the deal and the BOARD was skeptical of doing this deal. The fact that Elon isn't even a party to the agreement with Twitter is the biggest difference. The Parent - who is party to the agreement has very few assets - the guarantee from Elon for the breakup fee, the equity commitment from Elon for the deal, and commitment letters from lenders to fund just north of $10B.

The Parent has a duty to use good faith to close - that duty does not apply to Elon. He can give his opinion to the lenders, state his wishes and intentions and they can decide to move forward with the deal or not.\n\nTwitter has always claimed that FEWER than 5% of their users are bots - if you're claiming they've said something else I must have missed it.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": ">\tTwitter has always claimed that FEWER than 5% of their users are bots - if you\u2019re claiming they\u2019ve said something else I must have missed it.\n\nThe source of the 5% is several filings where they are very careful to say exactly what the 5% applies to, and how they got the number.

Now if I dig into the data and figure out where my team made their mistake and yet continue to report their numbers I am committing fraud.
