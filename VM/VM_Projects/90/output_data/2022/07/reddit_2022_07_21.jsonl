{"title": "Amazon Moves Deeper Into Healthcare With $3.9 Billion Deal for One Medical", "selftext": "Amazon .com said it was buying medical care company, One Medical, pushing deeper into the healthcare game. The company is being acquired in an all-cash transaction for roughly $3.9 billion, including debt. One Medical, owned by San Francisco-based 1Life Healthcare, offers concierge-based medical services.\n\nOne Medical adds to Amazon\u2019s (ticker: AMZN) portfolio of healthcare services. The online retailer introduced Amazon Care in late 2019, which offered access to urgent and primary care services and targeted the employer market. Soon after that service was launched, it acquired Health Navigator, an online symptom-checking tool.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/amazon-healthcare-one-medical-51658410615?mod=search\\_headline](https://www.marketwatch.com/articles/amazon-healthcare-one-medical-51658410615?mod=search_headline)", "id": "w4i4yh", "created_utc": 1658413828.0, "score": 128, "upvote_ratio": 0.93, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": "One Medical charged me $450 for a 15 minute consultation the provider wasnt qualified to speak to", "score": 80, "replies": [{"body": "I thought it was a subscription based service that\u2019s like $200 per year?", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "Nope just like going to a hospital.

Expansion for the sake of expansion will typically turn out to be a poor investment more often than not.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "GE didnt just expand, they went from engineering to finance. The entire culture was changed from long term performance to immediate returns under Welch. It became a dog eat dog company like most financial companies. This alienated the techs and engineers who generally do not behave this way, making the work environment inhospitable for innovation.\n\nIn other words, thinking far ahead was not rewarded. The ones who got the bonuses and had job safety were the ones who found ways to immediately increase profit. So what do engineers do in this case? Well they started looking for ways to increase profit by cutting corners so that they can get bonuses and not have to worry about being fired which was also part of the Welch strategy. Constant churning of workers was his style (basically he turned GE into a employee grinder).\n\nIn other words GE didnt fail due to expansion. They failed due to bad leadership. Call it company culture if you like but ultimately it was the execs who set up the rewards and punishment systems that resulted in that culture.\n\nNow all that said, its important to note that the \"grinder\" environment isnt the problem in itself. There are certain industries that have to be run that way because they depend entirely on hustle rather than brains. Finance is an obvious example. There are no engineers in that field. Just a bunch of guys selling something. So in that industry, the \"grinder\" works. It sucks, but it works.\n\nBut the grinder will lead to near absolute failure in any industry that is dependent on innovation and tech advantage. There are obvious reasons for this. Innovation requires two things. First, happy workers or they will take their good ideas elsewhere. And two, patience. You have to be willing to forgo immediate returns for long term returns while understanding that many ideas wont work (risk) and just because they dont work, doesnt mean people werent doing good work. Thats the stark difference with hustle type work.\n\nAmazon went from retail to mostly engineering at this point. Further not all companies failed like GE. Plenty did just fine expanding to all sorts of things. Berkshire is shining example of this. But others did as well. Proctor and Gamble is all over the place. JnJ is all over the place. Honeywell, Seimens, practically all the big cap defense contractors, 3M, ABB, LG, Philips, etc etc all did very well despite being spread across many industries.
