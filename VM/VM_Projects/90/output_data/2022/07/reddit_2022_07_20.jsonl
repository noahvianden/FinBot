Since I graduated college I\u2019ve been aggressively paying off my student loans and I\u2019m happy to say I\u2019m half way done with only $13,000 left.

I stopped putting money into my investment accounts a few months again to focus on paying off my loans. I am now wondering if I should allocate like $100 a week to savings and investing or should I pay off these loans as fast as I can?", "id": "w3hxse", "created_utc": 1658308912.0, "score": 20, "upvote_ratio": 0.77, "num_comments": 96, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|1|**First Seen In WSB**|5 months ago\n**Total Comments**|0|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=w3hxse)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=w3hxse)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1445215493440628}, {"body": "Since youre asking for an investment advice on WSB - yolo your savings into weekly options obviously", "score": 82, "replies": [{"body": "And take out more loans and chuck it at dailies and gourd futures!", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.33762848377227783}, {"body": "And post your loss porn or don\u2019t be associated with us", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.0335051491856575}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3382238447666168}, {"body": "Live life like a pro. \n\nStep 1.
