Most Meta bears would struggle to put a decent argument together based on numbers and fundamentals rather than \"feelz\"", "score": 50, "replies": [{"body": "Ok, here's a bear case.\n\n* Facebook (I refuse to call them by their new name) has a horrific reputation with consumers. Their brand is so toxic that they changed their name no doubt in part to run away from it's toxicity. This toxicity is going to hurt Facebook in a variety of ways in the future (covered in the later points).\n\n* Facebook is simply not going to trade at a sky high PE ratio like other FAANG stocks anymore. Their brand is so toxic that they've turned themselves into a modern day sin stock like MO that many will refuse to invest in for moral reasons. Reddit is a perfect example of this, a majority of the people at r/stocks will refuse to buy Facebook stock for any price. Many people blame Facebook for all the bad things that Social Media has done to society, and Facebook's past data scandals have only made them made this problem worse.\n\n* The VR/AR space Facebook wants to get into is a hot sector that's going to see a lot of new competition. And Facebook's toxic brand is going to be a real drag on them here once someone like Apple puts out a device that can go head to head with the Facebook owned Oculus. \n\n* The Metaverse is a similar story, there's going to be a lot of competition in the space. And because their brand is so toxic most people will not want to let Facebook win control of this market. They'd much rather someone like Apple, Microsoft, or some new company become the leader in the Metaverse space.\n\n* We don't know for sure how successful VR/AR is really going to be long term. People once thought that the 3D TV would be a big success, but today the 3D TV is in the graveyard. If I had to guess I suspect VR/AR will only have a limited audience once the initial \"I've gotta try this cool new technology out\" phase wears off. VR/AR can still be quite profitable with a limited audience, but imho it's highly unlikely to cannibalize other sectors of the gaming market.\n\n* As we saw with MySpace and other Social Media platforms nothing lasts forever. People move onto other social networking sites overtime, and Facebook's toxic brand, plus data privacy concerns, could help fuel an exodus to other social media sites in the future. While some Facebook bulls are fond of saying \"Facebook isn't just Facebook, they also own Instagram/etc.\" whenever someone says Facebook is dying, the fact is there's no guarantee that whatever the next hot Social Media site that steals users from a Facebook owned Social Media company ends up being will be owned by Facebook. Given Facebook's large size in the social media space, it's highly unlikely that regulators will let them purchase the next big up and coming social media site like they did with Instagram.\n\n* Facebook's social media presence is already so big today that there's very limited upside potential, outside of the entire market expanding. The only real growth they can get is by stuffing more ads onto their sites, which might encourage more users to get ad blockers or go elsewhere.\n\nSo basically I'm NOT making a \"Facebook is going to zero\" prediction. I'm stating that because of all of the above reasons I'm highly skeptical that Facebook is anywhere near as cheap as many Facebook bulls argue.
