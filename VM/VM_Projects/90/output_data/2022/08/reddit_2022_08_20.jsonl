{"title": "An update to the $BBBY Watermelon Loving Legacy", "selftext": "In case you were all wondering, I am preparing the video as promised, where I make passionate love to a buttered watermelon painted like Mila Kunis. \n\nBut at this point you may be thinking to yourself, $BBBY has dropped to under $9, I\u2019m angry, what joy would watching a grown man make love to a buttered art piece bring to me?\n\nYou need to understand that this isn\u2019t about simply making sweet love to a buttered plant species from the Cucurbitaceae family painted like an A list actress. This watermelon is a microcosm that reflects the fragile life of an everyday simple trader like us. \n\nEach deep insertion into Melon Mila\u2019s tight watermelon hole represents the harrowingly emotional ups and downs we experience as the price of $BBBY fluctuates. \n\nTo stop penetrating would be to give up hope. To stop short of the dreams we have of making it big through a risky investment. This watermelon is more than a watermelon, it represents who we are in r/wallstreetbets\n\nRemember my friends, the two most powerful warriors of all are patience and time.", "id": "wstog7", "created_utc": 1660955861.0, "score": 268, "upvote_ratio": 0.94, "num_comments": 101, "comments": [{"body": "This guy fucks", "score": 86, "replies": [{"body": "Makes love\\*\\* \ud83c\udf49", "score": 56, "replies": [{"body": "If stock finishes over 10.80 tomorrow you need to post pic of painted watermelon", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.07729592174291611}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.256356418132782}, {"body": "\u2026 Watermelons.", "score": 4, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.14415161311626434}, {"body": "![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)", "score": 6, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18171796202659607}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.1319814771413803}, {"body": "Not the hero we need but the hero we deserve", "score": 52, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17092758417129517}, {"body": "The moment the vid is posted bbby will skyrocket", "score": 34, "replies": [{"body": "If that is the big thing when it does imagine the news clips of \"the boys who beat the market\" and they cut to a -formerly- seedless watermelon.", "score": 21, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.31324532628059387}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.25442972779273987}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 29, "replies": [{"body": "Is he banned yet, hero to zero kinda moment.", "score": 5, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.18133695423603058}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09935346245765686}, {"body": "[removed]", "score": 23, "replies": [{"body": "# BAN BAN BAN", "score": 9, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.30995973944664}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09935346245765686}, {"body": "Thank you for the update, you have restored my faith in humanity.
