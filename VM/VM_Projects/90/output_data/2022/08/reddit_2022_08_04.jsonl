{"title": "2 Fast 2 VERUious", "selftext": "# Alright, you plebs. Sit down and let me tell you a story about $VERU and its little friend, Sabizabulin.\n\n**You might be asking, da fu\\*\\* is Sabizabulin?**\n\n**Read the results of the study yourself:**\n\n**RESULTS**\n\nA total of 204 patients were randomly assigned to treatment: 134 to sabizabulin and 70 to placebo. Baseline characteristics were similar. Sabizabulin superiority was demonstrated by a planned interim analysis for the first 150 randomized patients. Sabizabulin treatment resulted in a 24.9 percentage point absolute reduction and a 55.2% relative reduction in deaths compared with placebo (odds ratio, 3.23; 95% CI confidence interval, 1.45 to 7.22; P=0.0042). The mortality rate was 20.2% (19 of 94) for sabizabulin versus 45.1% (23 of 51) for placebo. For the key secondary end points, sabizabulin treatment resulted in a 43% relative reduction in ICU days (P=0.0013), a 49% relative reduction in days on mechanical ventilation (P=0.0013), and a 26% relative reduction in days in the hospital (P=0.0277) versus placebo. Adverse and serious adverse events were lower in the sabizabulin group compared with the placebo group.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nSabizabulin treatment resulted in a 24.9% absolute reduction in deaths compared with placebo in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 at high risk for ARDS and death, with a lower incidence of adverse and serious adverse events compared with placebo. (Funded by Veru, Inc.; [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) number, NCT04842747.)\n\n# You: But \ud83d\udc51 Plebs, I'm an idiot. What does this even mean?\n\n\u201cIts demonstrated ability to improve outcomes in those at high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death distinguishes sabizabulin from MRK's Lagevrio and PFE's Paxlovid, indicated for milder disease and for which respective US government procurement contracts worth $2.2B and $5.3B have been awarded,\u201d Gershell commented. **\u201cWith the global pandemic showing little sign of abating and BARDA to be allocated $9.25B in additional COVID-19 funding, we believe sabizabulin will serve critical roles in the US and abroad.\u201d**\n\nTo this end, Gershell reiterated an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on VERU shares, while boosting the price target from **$25 to $36.** Think you\u2019ve missed the boat on this one? Think again. **Gershell\u2019s target makes room for gains of \\~200%.**\n\n# TL;DR VERU made RONA pills and will go BRRRRRR\n\n# You: What about for my homies in the back that only care about squeezes?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wh8qn1zvmpf91.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=de6bca57c6e320e1d1d1da424ec8a2a8f566a4fa\n\nWell, good news, you little autists. $VERU currently has **42.84% SI with 80,070,000 outstanding shares.**\n\nIf only it had some sort of catalyst coming up that could trigger a run on the stock\u2026\n\n**The European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Emergency Task Force (ETF) has started a review of Sabizabulin for treating COVID-19.**\n\n**You: So what?**\n\n**Me: \\*slaps you\\***\n\nOnce the EMA completes its findings, Sabizabulin will be authorized to be used in all member states. That means VERU is going to sell the ever-living shit out of Sabizabulin to the EU running up into flu season. Not only that, approval by EMA also helps FastTrack approval for the US (see above multi-billion dollar contracts.\n\nThat's not all!\n\nOn June 6th, Veru also submitted Veru has submitted an\u00a0[application](https://verupharma.com/news/veru-submits-emergency-use-authorization-eua-application-to-u-s-fda-for-sabizabulin-its-novel-oral-antiviral-and-anti-inflammatory-drug-candidate-for-hospitalized-covid-19-patients-at-high-risk-f/)\u00a0seeking emergency use authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a 9mg dose of oral sabizabulin to treat moderate to severe hospitalised Covid-19 patients.\n\n**\u201cWe have also scaled up manufacturing of sabizabulin 9mg capsules to meet the needs of patients in the US and are building our US infectious disease commercial franchise.\u201d**\n\nThey already started making enough supply to sell to the US immediately. Just like the EMA, the US also fast-tracked the approval process and should be approving it any day now.\n\n**So to recap:**\n\n1. VERU is making an oral RONA pill that reduces deaths by 25%\n2. Sabizabulin is getting fast-tracked by the FDA\n3. Sabizabulin is getting fast-tracked by the EMA\n4. Over the course of the next 30-days, we will get 2 announcements of Sabizabulin being authorized for emergency use in the US and EU and they have already started making supply to prep for this.\n5.

Oppenheimer & Co Inc had filed a previous 13F-HR on 2022-02-02 disclosing 19,194 shares of Veru Inc at a value of $113,000 USD. This represents a change in shares of -100.00 percent and a change in value of -100.00 percent during the quarter.*\n\n$VERU has $13.03M in Revenue with a Net Profit Margin of -108.82%. Read all of the financials [HERE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VERU/financials?p=VERU). It doesn't really matter. This is pharma world where small companies make the perfect drug and moon. See MRNA for an example of this. VERU's small/kind-of poor company outlook only increased the SI, which is good for us and bad for them.\n\nThat's it. That is the bear case. Sabizabulin is overwhelmingly a positive result and should pass\u2026even according to Oppenheimer, who probably regrets selling 19,194 shares right about now.\n\n*\"Oppenheimer said that a new analysis conducted by Veru (NASDAQ:VERU) on mortality rates in a phase 3 trial of its COVID-19 therapy sabizabulin assuages concerns* ***and will lead to an Emergency Use Authorization from the U.S. FDA.\"***\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q5mknba8npf91.png?width=586&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9329b4b21b917462f04884fc5a4a392fd8412f9\n\n# You: Okay, okay. This all sounds pretty bullish, but when will this even happen?\n\nT**he review of sabizabulin was started on 27 July 2022** under Article 18 of Regulation 2022/123, following a request from Germany. EMA\u2019s Emergency Task Force (ETF) will conduct the review in accordance with Article 18 (3) and send recommendations to EMA\u2019s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, which will issue the Agency\u2019s opinion.\n\n# You: Yeah, but that could take months!\n\n# Me: Nuh-uh.\n\nI read the charter that created the EMA's Emergency Task Force (ETF) Typically, reviews of studies take up to 200 days. However, they established the ETF in 2022, **which is authorized to rush COVID-related studies.**\n\n*Article 15, section 7: The ETF shall perform its tasks as an advisory and support body separate from, and* ***without prejudice*** *to, the tasks of the scientific committees of the Agency as regards the authorization, supervision, and pharmacovigilance of the medicinal products concerned and related regulatory actions to ensure the quality, safety and efficacy of those medicinal products.*\n\nBecause we are technically in a state of emergency, they are granted special privileges \"without prejudice\". According to the charter,\n\n# Me: Now pay attention. This is the most important part.\n\n*Article 16, section 2: Where a developer engages in an accelerated scientific advice process,* ***the ETF shall provide the advice referred to in paragraph 1 free of charge at the latest 20 days after the developer submits a complete set of the requested information and data to the Agency. The advice shall be endorsed by the EU member states.***\n\nThe EMA meets on a monthly cadence, but because we are in a state of emergency, member states are allowed to hear the ETF's findings and vote via remote meetings. This means that the very latest they will present findings to the EMA is August 16th. EMA has scheduled meetings on August 16th, 17th, 18th, and 19th.\n\nAt the very latest, we should know if Sabizabulin will be approved for use by the EMA on **August 16th, if not earlier.**\n\n# You: Is there anything else?\n\n# Me: Yes!\n\n**Veru has earnings on August 11th.** Because of this, we will see a ramp in IV leading up to that date with a potential drop-off, pending whatever news they drop on that call... All this is, is another opportunity to buy at a lower IV. When the EMA announces the approval of sabizabulin later this month, it won't even matter. Shorts will get squeezed, our dicks will get hard, and we will get paid.\n\nNot to mention the upcoming emergency use of sabizabulin by the FDA. Some rumors have that being approved tomorrow, 60-days from when it was submitted. That is why you see a massive options order flow for 8/5.\n\n# You: I am dumb and can't read so good. What is the TL;DR?\n\nThis play has something for everyone. High short interest, pharma squeeze with options, and a guaranteed bullish event on the horizon. It's also a value play once Sabizabulin gets approved because it will unlock a potential $9.25 B in funds from BARDA, which \"*Sabizabulin will serve critical roles in the US and abroad.\"* That is just potential US contracts. It isn't even touching on the contracts it can secure in the very near future from the EU. This baby only has a Market Cap of $985 M right now. There is sooo much room to run. Add a little squeeze juice on top of that, and we have ourselves a perfect storm.\n\nSome of you have been asking this week, \u201cwhat stock can make me a millionaire that costs $12.50?\u201d\n\nVERU can. \n\n# Positions:\n\n[8/19 $16c](https://imgur.com/a/IB76s63)\n\n[8/19 $26c](https://imgur.com/a/eiN3LWP)\n\n[9/16 $26c](https://imgur.com/a/elOMANG)\n\nMy positions - Just shy under $16k [https://imgur.com/a/4eAVuQ7](https://imgur.com/a/4eAVuQ7)\n\n8/19 $16c x 40\n\n8/19 $26c x 150\n\n9/16 $26c x 15\n\nGod speed, you degenerates.", "id": "wg3c2f", "created_utc": 1659624990.0, "score": 68, "upvote_ratio": 0.83, "num_comments": 90, "comments": [{"body": "You had me at \u201cslaps you\u201d\n\nIn with 12k on margin.", "score": 16, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.11493588238954544}, {"body": "In for 5 $13c 9/2's because there are no other plays on here.", "score": 13, "replies": [{"body": "Did you hold through earnings today?", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "I wish!

{"title": "The ultimate guide on how to trade CPI week/ day", "selftext": "&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gdj81xvu7sf91.png?width=497&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6971ae74fa565e1f5266d013e869234461474b5\n\nOf the last 7 CPI days.. we have seen SPY open up red 5 out of 7 times and of those 5 times 4 out of the 5 times have been >1% red. Of the 2 out of 6 times that have been green both have opened less than 1% green. \n\nLooking at the actual intraday movement of CPI days there has only been one two times when SPY closed HIGHER than its opening price on CPI days\u2026 That means that 5 of the last 7 CPI days we have closed below our opening price regardless of whether we open red or green. The average % close below opening is  0.924%. On the two days that have closed HIGHER than opening price (April and July CPI) we have seen an average of +0.83%.\n\nOf the last 7 CPIs the two days before CPI releases is averaging a total drop from open to close of -0.35%... however, if we look at the last four CPIs (April, May, June and July) we are averaging a two day drop of -2.61%. That\u2019s a pretty massive drop for two days\u2026\n\n**Should we swing overnight puts?**\n\nIn general overnight puts are almost the golden ticket to success\u2026 interestingly enough lets look at if we bought puts for CPI and we were wrong (such as in January and April). \n\nFor the January 12th CPI which opened 0.6%+\u2026 on January 11th we open a ATM 469P. Premium at 415pm is 1.35 and it opened at 1.75. So even though that morning SPY would have opened 0.6% green your puts due to the lovely IV pump of a 0dte would have been profitable had you sold IMMEDIATELY at open\u2026 you would have sold for 29% profit however, hold it any longer then that and it would be worthless and never see green again. \n\nFor the April 12th CPI which opened +0.71%... On April 11th EOD we buy an ATM puts 439. Premium at 415pm would have been 2.7 and had we sold (and I mean IMMEDIATELY at open) you would have sold for 2.7. However, if you held for even 5minutes you would be looking at a premium of 1.98 which would give you a net loss of 27%. The other intriguing thing about this is that had you just held (and you woulda held through some big red) by 305pm you would have been back to even and by and by 325pm you would have been up 27% and able to close them for profit. (note you would be playing a 1dte here not a 0dte here due to the CPI being on a Tuesday so that saves you from some of the drop).\n\nSo the only two days it opened green we actually would be breakeven or profitable\u2026. Now lets look at the smallest open day as comparison. \n\nMay 11th opened at -0.02%. If we bought a May 11th 0dte ATM 399put at 415pm the day before our premium would have been 3.79. When markets opened the next day it would have opened at 3.81. This would give you a measly 0.5% profit. However that first 5minute candle would have seen a spike to 4.74 for a profit of 25%. However after that these puts would have dropped to absolutely worthless by 1130am. Had you diamond handed them though by EOD market close you would be looking at a premium 6.96 for a 83.6%. \n\nOkay so that 3 examples of when a over night put even if you were wrong (or barely right) was essentially a free play\u2026. Now lets look at had we been correct (im only going to show the June and July as there were the most impressive opens)\n\nJune 10th CPI a 0dte ATM 401p woulda opened at 160%... and by 1030am that put would be worth 315%... \n\nJuly 13th CPI a 0dte ATM 380p woulda opened at 101% and by 935am would be worth 121%... however, we all remember what happened that day\u2026 had you diamond handed these by 1040am you would be back to even and from there it would never see green again\u2026\n\nSo what does this show you\u2026 well it shows you pretty much CPI puts ATM\u2026 are worth the gamble in my opinion\u2026 Of course all overnight plays should be considered lottos and should be lotto sized\u2026 no full ports. \n\n**Intraday movement before CPI**\n\nThe January 11th, February 10th and March 9th (days before CPI) were all considered flat days. However, When we look at the last four CPI days (April, May, June and July) all four of them have had pretty significant dumps frm about 1pm to close. If you had bought puts around 1pm almost all four of these days you would have ended up extremely profitable. \n\nThe average drop of the last four CPIs from 1pm till EOD is 1.425% with the smallest being 0.8% in April and the most being 2.3% in June. \n\nIntraday puts are almost certainly the play once the morning chop is over. \n\n**Day of CPI SPY trends**\n\nJanuary 12th- rallied. dumped... then traded sideways all day.\n\nFebruary 10th- rallied till 1030 then dumped 2.35% \n\nMarch 10th- rallied till 1015 dumped till 1130 then rallied 1.5% by EOD\n\nApril 12th- rallied till 945am then dumped 2.08% by EOD\n\nMay 11th- rallied till 1130am then dumped 3% by EOD\n\nJune 10th- dumped all day \n\nJuly 13th- rallied till 3pm and then dumped 0.7% EOD (1pm to 2pm did dump 0.8% before recovery)\n\n**What do I expect CPI to be?**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hvgshh5w7sf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7e7813bbe5c76b801ca35fbcf691ec94ba51635\n\nSomething very interesting about this current CPI print and something I cant remember about any of the other CPIs\u2026 is that the TEForecast is actually higher than consensus. The consensus and forecast are almost never different from eachother let alone predicting higher\u2026 Arguably I am not an economist or expert in CPI but in general having the consensus lower then the forecast and lower then previous CPI is bound to be a big deal if that misses\u2026\n\nOkay so the Fed is predicting 8.9%... once again they are trying to say we have \u201cpeaked\u201d and or slowed at least. Why does this matter? Well in May they attempted to say Inflation peaked also calling for a 0.3% drop in inflation and actual inflation came in 0.2% higher then expected. \n\nThe market when they heard that at 830am had a beautiful 2% sell off, however, \u201cmagically\u201d climbed back to about breakeven by open and then later that day dumped from from its high to low 3.08%. \n\nWe have been averaging 0.3% higher than expected the last CPI. Which if we miss by 0.3% that would be 9.2% which is not only higher then expected obviously but its also higher than the previous CPI by 0.1%. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/itpzjqrw7sf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=b36da484d9cc31db909b2a042d0009bc0813b7a4\n\nThis chart comes from the Cleveland feds website and so does the next. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ozmx6n7x7sf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=699add32638d270c8a6a3a842c383e7b40333722\n\nSomething that is interesting about the Cleveland fed prediction of YOY cpi is that they are almost ALWAYS 0.3% lower then what actual inflation is\u2026 which means for this July CPI print they are expected 8.82% + 0.3% gives us a magical number of\u2026. 9.1% CPI. Which would be higher than consensus.   \n   \n \n\nNow why does this matter? \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u51sodpx7sf91.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c2037ada94f7bda73f87328dd2f77a21bb3bdbd\n\nAs you can see currently there is an 87% \u201cconsensus\u201d that the Fed is going to do a 50bps hike come September. So if we get a higher than expected CPI rating on August 10th this is going to put additional pressure on the feds. A higher than expected CPI shows that we the rate hikes have still not calmed down inflation. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/49ajei6y7sf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=07a441fe977b028e8d96ae2f767b39e451c97da0\n\nSomething else to be interested in is the fact that JPOW himself said \u201cim more concerned about PCE then CPI\u201d and the PCE right after he said that was dogwater\u2026 with a terrible PCE, GDP now double negative and a terrible CPI print\u2026 the fed is going to be forced to get more aggressive. \n\nThe markets pretty much are running under the impression JPOW saved the day cpi has peaked, inflation is over and the rate hikes are going to be 50bps or no rate hikes. However, this inflation is going to rock the markets I feel. \n\nMarkets shook the last CPI off because they already expected the feds to do a 75bps hike. However, expecting a 50bps hike there is no way if CPI keeps going up that we are going to get a 50bps hike. And markets are going to recognize this. \n\nAlso unique is that the next FOMC is not till September 21st and we will have the CPI on August 10th and another CPI prior to this meeting on September 13th. \n\n**So whats the play? How am I going to play CPI?**\n\nRemembering like FOMC I trade off the data I have analyzed and what the highest probability risk to reward is\u2026 I will be opening a Wednesday expiration put ATM Tomorrow (Friday) before market closes at 415pm. I plan to open a SPY put (I am also holding an Apple out which I most likely will average down too). \n\nFrom there my plan is to let these puts run until Tuesday before market closes. If we happen to get a massively red day on Monday (think 2-3% red) then I will take profits that day. If Monday is a green day or a wash day (doji) then I will hold till Tuesday. If neither of these days drops then I will hold till expiration in hopes of a June CPI repeat. \n\nOkay so besides that I plan to open an overnight put Tuesday night. I will do an ATM put 0dte for Wednesday. Depending on what CPI comes in at and what we open at (red wise) I will close the put at open. I would be hesitant to hold any puts past open just because of how Julys CPI played out. If I happened to be wrong on that 0dte put play I would immediately sell at market open Wednesday. \n\nAll position sizes will be small.", "id": "wgfp8g", "created_utc": 1659656034.0, "score": 94,
