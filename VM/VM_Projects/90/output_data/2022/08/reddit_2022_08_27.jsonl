{"title": "I am worried to invest over possibility of recession.", "selftext": "To preface I know we are in a recession but the economy doesn\u2019t seem to be as bad as it could end up being. I am unsure if it will get worse, when it will, and how much worse.\n\nWith the looming horizon of a possible recession I have put off starting to invest. I have waited over a year to start but finally made a brokerage account with fidelity. \n\nI made one cause of the bbby fun, I bought one share at $18 thinking the stock would float around back up to 20-30. But the news and stuff kicked not down. I have no real reason to sell it though and will hold till they either go bankrupt or hit 20 in like 20 years.\n\nI have also mulled over doing the fidelity tutorial of options, but I know I should probably stay away from options since the are so high risk.\n\nOne way I thought to gain some knowledge is to follow Hardy\u2019s advice and buy that one college textbook. I\u2019d like to think I\u2019d semi understand it due to being in a stem major and the book being math economics from the little I had seen.\n\n\n\nBut I just want opinions on whether or not y\u2019all think a recession is bound to happen. I listened to Powells speech yesterday and thought it didn\u2019t sound too bad (but it is not like he is just gonna come out and say \u201cwe fucked up the economy is gonna crash big time\u201d.) Then I get home and see shit went down which I expected but some of the reactions I saw where of surprise. Of some people seeming to think the economy is hunky dory.\n\nTLDR: I WANT YALL\u2019S OPINION OVER THE HEALTH OF THE ECONOMY, IF YOU THINK A RECESSION/DEPRESSION WILL HAPPEN/GET WORSE. AND IF NEWBIES LIKE ME SHOULD JUST INVEST START TO INVEST ANYWAY.\n\n\n\nAlso dear mod bros, I am sorry if this doesn\u2019t fit the communities rules and should of went in a discussion board. \ud83c\udf2f\ud83c\udf2f\ud83c\udf2f", "id": "wz3dje", "created_utc": 1661608271.0, "score": 4, "upvote_ratio": 0.54, "num_comments": 99, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | |[DGEN\\FRENDS](https://twitter.com/dgenfrends)|\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|2|**First Seen In WSB**|4 months ago\n**Total Comments**|14|**Previous DD**|\n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wz3dje)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wz3dje)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.23031949996948242}, {"body": "If you\u2019re worried about risk buy indexes and hold with a long term horizon in mind ( like 10-20 years, not 8 months).
