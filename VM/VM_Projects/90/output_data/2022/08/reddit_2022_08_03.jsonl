{"title": "8-3-22 SPY/ ES Futures and Apple Daily TA", "selftext": "Today we saw yet again a case of extreme bull momentum. The bulls were out in full force today or should I say\u2026 the bears didn\u2019t wanna sell today. \n\nThis is now the 5th day in a row where we have opened ran up\u2026 dumped (and a very convincing dump may I add) only for us to then run even harder EOD. \n\nThe craziest thing of the whole day is Apple\u2026 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ifthv1ij8kf91.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cf6e847ff50c2468be530ad00eb8e4a64f96d9d\n\nApple had an implied move of $2.01 with a improbable high of 162.84\u2026 for those of you who don\u2019t know IV prices in movement everyday and overall it provides probable and improbable ranges\u2026 generally speaking even touching the improbable high is RARE let alone going over it\u2026\n\nSo today we saw apple have a total DTR (daily true range) of 5.84 which is 290% of the implied IV move. It was also 144% of the average 10day range and 134% of the 30day average range. It reached nearly $4 over its improbable high of day. This is one of the most imbalanced and \u201cunexpected\u201d moves I have ever seen on apple. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vy6xbs3k8kf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=9992b6c6a9028c8553f9205388de4e07d540a8b7\n\nThis was the greenest close apple has had since May 27th. As you can see looking very interesting on the daily\u2026 \n\nWe have officially broke out of the red rising wedge. We are now working on another black dotted rising wedge. This one uses early June dates for the resistance line. Today Apple perfectly hit that. It uses the last 7 trading days support for the support line. \n\nThis pattern gives a high of 167.6 and a low of 162.9. We still have that gap down below also on Apple but we are obviously getting further and further away form that gap. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tus6p2pk8kf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=200c1bda0bb87c211cf2e9ecec02b9dc8d81e5e5\n\nApple weekly chart broke its resistance line today too for the overall down trend and now all that is left is the resistance of the overall market which uses January 3rd and March 28th weekly highs as resistance. That gives us a possible upside of 174.5 next week. \n\nOverall if this extreme bullish momentum keeps up there is a case to be made for apple 175 next week. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/euqavk8l8kf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a06be3d1bd7d4916f02809ca8329af7ad4a5d18\n\nOverall SPY and Futures are putting in some crazy looking rising wedges\u2026 some of the tallest and most extreme rising wedges I have seen in a while on the daily. \n\nCurrently you can see on SPY we have the purple dotted resistance line which we rejected perfectly today. It uses the July 29th and June 28th daily candles for resistance. Resistance for tomorrow will be at 416.7\n\nThe black dotted resistance line uses July 29th, July 8th, July 7th and June 29th for resistance. This give sus a resistance of 418.8 tomorrow. \n\nAnd then we have the red dotted resistance line from June 28th, June 15th and June 13th which gives us resistance of 423.5 for tomorrow. \n\nWe have three potential rising wedges on the daily right now which is the most I have ever seen and they all give us potential to reject a resistance tomorrow. \n\nThe black dotted support line using August 3rd, Aug 2nd, July 27th and July 26th we have 413.8 as support tomorrow. \n\nWe broke the possible down trend resistance today too. \n\nWe are also about to hit the 417.4 level support which is also the daily 200ema. \n\nOverall despite pretty much every sign pointing to a sell off today AND that morning dump looking hella convincing the bears continue to be in control. There is no reason to short this until we break the 100ema. But I still hesitate to go long until we see the daily 200ema confirmed broken.\n\nIf we break that 200ema there is a decent chance we reach out for 430 next week. A good CPI could fuel an even higher bull run too. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lv324lxl8kf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=863757c0e7963f322dc6c7a70d5bb2ceb9001593\n\nFutures major resistances are the blacked dotted rising wedge at 4178, red dotted resistance at 4202 and the blue bull channel at 4241.\n\nThe 4178 level is both the daily 200ema and it is the resistance from June highs. \n\nThe biggest supports to watch for ES is 4117 and 4079 tomorrow. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z44f7ggm8kf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2020a20b334ba1b0e2d880768f85da8ff568465a\n\nSpy on the weekly timeframe did attempt to break into the next weekly level at 415 today, however, end of day it lost that level. This has been a level that has been struggled to be breached and closed over since April. This will be a key level to watch the bulls and bears fight over. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rl0qkm1n8kf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9034aa07d93719cc3fcf8925c7ae0e20c227d37\n\nFutures also rejecting this level of 4160 too. This level for futures too has been pretty major resistance since April. \n\nThe bears will need to defend these 415/ 4160 level aggressively tomorrow if they have any hopes for the EOW and next week. Overall this is setting up for a break out to that 430/ 4360 levels unless we see a major sell off tomorrow and Friday. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8a504xon8kf91.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=54e7bd56d1dd6b2d9ca4aa2b693920e9e8ca191e\n\nThe VIX had the biggest red close since June 15th\u2026 the day of FOMC. I still struggle to short this until we see the VIX do something other than drop every single day. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a GREAT day I turned into an L by not following my own rules of course. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ytsqzdo8kf91.png?width=770&format=png&auto=webp&s=11c84e9c9985f21267473f7381aaf4205a4fbb85\n\nI played that morning drop pretty nicely. Got out for a 21.1% gain (of course it pretty much went straight to 100% right after\u2026 ) but got caught at what looked like a clear support break and close under 8ema only to get burnt. I didn\u2019t manage my risk well enough and from there it was pretty much over. And then they faked me out with the head and shoulders on the 15min and break of momentum only to rip it even higher. \n\nTodays lesson\u2026 stick to your rules AND never ever fight momentum. The momentum today especially on the volumes was some of the stupidest extreme bull momentum ive seen yet. \n\nTomorrows a new day and a new chance. \n\nI am carrying some 9dte Apple 152.5 puts overnight that I do suspect by next week to at minimum break even. If we ever lose this bull momentum and we drop to gap fill as I suspect Apple needs to then they will be sitting pretty good.", "id": "wfhi4n", "created_utc": 1659559423.0, "score": 44,

investor flows have been the major driver of the rebound in equities in the last few days across the broader market, as aggregate buying has been consistently above the YTD average (avg. $1.36BN over the last five days), while the focus has been on classic tech stocks such as TSLA, NVDA, AAPL, AMD, and AMZN.\n\n>last Friday net retail inflows were massive relative to the equity performance especially given that retail investors are contrarian: they buy when prices fall \u2013 as they perceive it as a good buy-the-dip opportunity. On the other side, they are hesitant to chase rallies in the early stages. Nevertheless, on the 29th of July, the net daily imbalance amounted to US$ 1.6Bn, the highest figure in a day of positive S&P 500 performance since the start of the sell-off.\n\nSo this rally has mostly been retail driven, hence the euphoria and fomo momentum.
