The \"pennies in front of a steamroller\" and \"you will lose everything\" people are most likely small account holders or have never actually tried it, or both.\n\nYou need a 6 figure account to qualify for portfolio margin. It's best to contribute aggressively and don't take on too much risk (deep OTM credit spreads) until you get to that account sirze. When you have PM, your buying power is calculated differently. You get a favorable BP calculation for options on big stable indexes like SPX as well. \n\nYou still have to manage risk. Big buying power is not some magic trick. But 30% or so of PM buying power is noticeable for sure and  gives you some leverage to work with.\n\nYou don't \"lose everything\" if a put gets exercised. You are assigned 100 shares of the underlying at the option strike price. I've been assigned 4 times from about 3000 trades, and it's actually no big deal if you are smart about risk management. I've been margin called on two of those assignments, because I was in long stock instead of cash. Just stay calm and sell the underlying for the best price you can get.

The BP required is high, and smaller account holders will criticize the BP requirements as \"capital inefficient\".

You can roll out and down every few days with SPY and GTC orders. Some small account holders will criticize rolling as \"just hiding a loss from yourself\" and an inefficient use of capital. Well, Rule #1 in this game is to not lose money. If I roll out and down for a small credit, the following things happen- I keep the credit from the original trade, I get a small credit for rolling (sometimes it's a decent premium), I lower the strike and thus the cost of recovery if needed, and recover the Delta that I sold at originally (might take a few rolls). And I don't lose a dime.\n\nYes, I made less money on options this year than last year. I suppose that's the way it is, selling puts in a bear market.
