{"title": "ASTS - the Starlink of cell phones (but 10x better). +50% over the past week, and just getting started!", "selftext": "\nI\u2019m tired of seeing the same stocks and shitty memes posted here every day, so let\u2019s do some old-fashioned DD like before 2021. Alright you retards, are you guys tired of throwing away money on shitcos? Want to make some real money on a stock with an actual future that lets you confidently diamond hand through any bear market?\n\n\nThen look no further than ASTS - \u00a0the Starlink of cell phones (but 10x better)! Why? Because it lets ANY phone on the planet have a 5G signal ANYWHERE on the planet with ZERO extra hardware required. You can lose money on FDs in the Amazon rainforest, you can sext your wife\u2019s boyfriend in Antartica, and you can even call in sick to your Wendy\u2019s day job in the middle of the ocean! It achieves this with powerful satellites in orbit that connect your cell phone to a ground station, so you can have service anywhere at anytime.\n\n\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t this miraculous technology require partnerships with all of the major players in the telecom space?\u201d \u2013 yes, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s why Vodafone, American Tower, Rakuten, and AT&T are the major investors behind the company, publicly declaring ASTS to be the future of the industry:\n\n\nVodafone: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MT8AAOSxMuk\n\nAmerican Tower: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRvLA4YMhL8\n\nNokia: https://twitter.com/nokia/status/1552653352659406848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\n\nIt does all of this with a intelligent business model in which the MNOs that partner with ASTS are the ones who sell the 5G service to end users (ie regards like us) and they split the revenue 50/50. Projected revenue in 2024 is 1 billion, and will scale all the way up to 16 billion annually by 2030!\n\n\nTHE PLAY: Currently, the final test satellite is scheduled to launch with SpaceX next month, and we can see the launch run-up already beginning this week as it skyrocketed 50% throughout the week. This momentum seems primed to continue in the wake of the market being risk-on again due to the inflation being lesser than expected. \n\n\nI haven\u2019t even mentioned the best part: The stock is shorted almost THIRTY percent, and has 8 DTC due to the low volume that the stock usually has. The shorts are UNDERWATER, and the satellite launch will be the final nail in the coffin drowing these MFers for good.\n\n\nTLDR: We have a company with the technology of the future, a high short interest, and an imminent catalyst that will drive the stock price and force the shorts to cover creating a massive increase in price. Get on this literal rocket ship to the moon, or get out.\n\n\nPosition: 60k in ASTS warrants.", "id": "wlwma2", "created_utc": 1660237727.0, "score": 173, "upvote_ratio": 0.92, "num_comments": 87, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|18|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|382|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wlwma2/asts_the_starlink_of_cell_phones_but_10x_better/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wlwjiq/asts_the_starlink_of_cell_phones_but_10x_better/) \n**Account Age**|8 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=wlwma2)|**Vote Approve**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=wlwma2)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.37905025482177734}, {"body": "S P A C E M O B", "score": 42, "replies": [{"body": "S P A C E M O B", "score": 20, "replies": [{"body": "#S P A C E M O B   B A B Y", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "**S P A C E M O B**", "score": 10, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.9322242736816406}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.9322242736816406}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 1.0000001192092896}, {"body": "W E L T R A U M M O B I L T E L E F O N", "score": 5, "replies": [{"body": "W|E|L|T|R|A|U|M|M|O|B|I|L|T|E|L|E|F|O|N|\n-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|\nE|E| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\nL| |L| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\nT| | |T| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\nR| | | |R| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\nA| | | | |A| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |\nU| | | | | |U| | | | | | | | | | | | | |\nM| | | | | | |M| | | | | | | | | | | | |\nM| | | | | | | |M| | | | | | | | | | | |\nO| | | | | | | | |O| | | | | | | | | | |\nB| | | | | | | | | |B| | | | | | | | | |\nI| | | | | | | | | | |I| | | | | | | | |\nL| | | | | | | | | | | |L| | | | | | | |\nT| | | | | | | | | | | | |T| | | | | | |\nE| | | | | | | | | | | | | |E| | | | | |\nL| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |L| | | | |\nE| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |E| | | |\nF| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |F| | |\nO| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |O| |\nN| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |N|", "score": 2, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.5043736696243286}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3332354426383972}], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.17814794182777405}, {"body": "[deleted]", "score": 37, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.09321409463882446}, {"body": "9000 shares strong on this one.
