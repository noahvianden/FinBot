{"title": "Taking advantage of bottoms, discussion", "selftext": "For many reasons, I think this recent pull back from ATH (just over -20%) is over. CQQQ bottomed and was oversold even on the monthly and weekly time frames as the Chinese market saw major capitulation and an impressive initial bounce, not too dissimilar from the 2008-9 bottom. QQQ SPY and many major stocks were/are all over sold on the longer time frames, and it\u2019s March. Check out March of 2020 and 2009, tax season, perfect time for there to be a rally, but that\u2019s more of a coincidence. That said I\u2019m still prepared for the possibility of a dead cat bounce as we still haven\u2019t gotten technical confirmation, technically. \n\nREGARDLESS, here\u2019s my question:\n\nIF this is the bottom of the pull back and we begin a rally here to potentially new ATHs, I want to take the utmost advantage of this opportunity. \n\n1) which sector/industry and which specific stocks do you think will have the biggest recovery IF this is the end of the pull back (and why)?\n\n2) what\u2019s the best way to act on that belief to maximise returns, ie, scaling into leaps or swing trades? Please do share your strategy\n\nI and many others among us appreciate you taking the time to type out your thoughtful insights. \n\nCheers and good luck brethren", "id": "tgyzdh", "created_utc": 1647602130.0, "score": 37, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "Misleading headline.

This is my first real post/discussion and most likely my last. As you can see in the two images, I am a shit investor. The trades that brought me low date back almost 7 years and I have never been green except for maybe my first trade ever for a split second. Today was supposed to be the day I was to get back on track towards turning my account green, but I failed at that as well.\n\nAs you can see, my losses have really accelerated in the past few months but they really began in earnest with TSLA back in 2017. I bought TSLA at $320 (pre-split) right before ER and rode it down for the next 3 months until it hit $180. After suffering through that, the first green day afterwards I sold all 500 shares for $194 or so. Cue Clown music as TSLA soared past my buy in and beyond within a few months. Then the next significant loss was on NCLH, which I bought in Feb2020 for $50 a share right before Covid. I suffered through that trade though the Covid Crash and diamond handed it all the way down to $7 a share and sold it at $12 and didn't look back. So at this point, I started trading volatility AND options like an idiot after seeing TVIX go from $20 to $1000 in a few weeks. Which did not work out either. Then I read about UVXY and began buying puts on it when it spikes, which actually worked for a while, but I got greedy and wanted more gains, so instead of buying longer dated puts for more time, I began playing short dated puts, which was a complete mistake.\n\nAfter blowing up most of my account trying to be a permabull last SeptemBear, I noticed a funny quirk of UVXY on Quad Witching and the Monday afterwards. If you purchase short dated UVXY calls at the bottom on the Thursday before Quad Witching, which usually occurred around 1430. There was consistently a pop in UVXY (due to Vix Futures) the morning of Quad Witching, and an even bigger spike the Monday following. Now I did my \"research\", which consisted of examining the price action for every Quad Witching (SPY, UVXY, and VIX Futures) from 2006-2021 and I discovered that there was consistently a pop in UVXY on both days. Although there was a couple of outliers on the March 2020 and 2021 Quad Witchings, which I will discuss below.\n\nSo when Dec2021 Quad Witching rolled around, I was prepared to take advantage of this price action. Unfortunately, the Dec2021 Quad witching did not behave exactly like the Sep2021 Quad Witching, so I was caught off guard when UVXY dipped to $14.08 at the open for like 5 minutes, and then mooned on me for the rest of the day. That was not the price action that I was expecting, so I wasn't able to grab the 1k $14 call contracts that I was aiming for. So I watched all this happen and it shot up to $16.82 that day and then mooned to $19 the following Monday right on schedule. I didn't buy in and watched all of this in disgust. So fast forward to yesterday, although the setup was different, UVXY behaved exactly like it did in September, so I went all in on $16.50 UVXY Calls expiring today, which I actually sold at the open today for break even. The problem is that I then FOMO'ed into $17 and $18 UVXY calls expiring next Friday, for the Monday pop.\n\nSo as we all know, SPY did not drill today as it has for the past 3 Quad Witchings and mooned like no tomorrow. So my UVXY calls bled out to practically nothing today and brought my account to the shambles that you see below. I don't actually know what I am going to do. I have now lost half a million dollars of my retirement and life savings. I have a pension, so I am fine for money, but I would like to get back even some day, but I don't even know if that is possible at this point. When I see posts like the ape that went from 17K to 75K to 600K on Amazon calls, I get hope, but I have never made a trade that successful before, so I don't even know how to go about it. When I try Amazon or TSLA calls, I just get fucked.\n\nWell, thanks for reading my shitty trader;s story. Hopefully this can be a lesson to someone to not day trade and don't ever try options. Although, to be frank, I was doing terrible even before I discovered options but they just made it just infinitely worse. This has been really cathartic. Have a good day.

Sometimes I'd win, which was nice. Now I could care less about visiting any casino or gambling in any capacity. Getting back even will take time and a fair amount of luck.
