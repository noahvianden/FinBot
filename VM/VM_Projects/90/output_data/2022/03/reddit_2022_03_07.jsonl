Doing the math that will be atleast 50% of my investment portfolio as I DCA into both my Roth and 401k by EOY 2022. Over time i will contribute a lot more to my 401k so I figured my 401k should always be bigger than my spec portfolio otherwise I did something really right. \n\nNow for my Roth I hold high risk growth stocks in different sectors that I have conviction in from highest to smallest position size:\n\n1) AMD/NVDA (Only\nPosition I haven\u2019t DCA\u2019ed yet; debating which one to go with as AMD fundamentals make it a better buy imo but NVDA has the better product)\n2) SQ\n3) COIN\n4) SE\n5) CRSP\n6) GE\n7) SNOW\n8) AI\n9) LCID\n10) QS\n11) FUBO\n12) SBET\n13) SPCE\n\nFirst 6 will make up about 70-75% of my spec portfolio with 3-5%ish positions on the rest.

The stock\u2019s reaction to last quarter\u2019s disappointing earnings shows how much it is hated because it had been slaughtered. My own opinion is people should wait a little longer because while there is always more downside to the stock,  the price is so cheap now that the odds will be to the upside once this market finds it\u2019s footing. FB is projected to grow to $134M in sales this year from $117M last year (15%). It trades at a PE of 15 but if you strip out the cash on it\u2019s balance sheet and stopped the $10B a year being spent on the Metaverse, it would have a PE of 10-11.   It would trade at half the PE of the S&P with double the average growth rate of 7% on the S&P.  So someone has this wrong.
