{"title": "Options with Training Wheels aka Defined Outcome Investing", "selftext": "When people want to dip their toes into options, so often they start with buying single leg options because it seems simpler to grasp. But what they don't realize is that they're playing a losing game and when the market moves against them, the results can be disastrous. Counter-intuitively, more complicated option strategies are actually safer and provide higher probability of winning. When you create spreads with options, you can achieve what we call \"defined outcome investing.\"\n\nInstitutional investors and the top 1% have been using defined outcome investing products for decades (in the form of structured notes and annuities and more recently unit investment trusts and exchange-traded funds). Retail investors should have access to the same tools to achieve less risk and a defined return on their investments in the market. \n\n## How Does Defined Outcome Investing Work?\u00a0\n\nFirst, let\u2019s define some terms that are relevant to defined outcome investing:\u00a0\n\n**Reference asset -** Each defined outcome investment is linked to the performance of a reference stock, ETF, or index. \n\n**Reference price -** This is the price of the reference stock, ETF, or market index.\n\n**Outcome period -** A defined outcome investment is not infinite. It is an option contract with a set time period.  \n\n**Cushion -** The cushion is the amount of the underlying asset price can go down before you lose any of your investment. In other words, this is the amount of safety blanket you have for your investment against the market.\n\n*Example:* If the market index **reference asset** falls by 18%, but your defined outcome investment has a buffer of 15%, then you will only lose 3% overall. The cushion has absorbed most of the decline. Some popular buffers are set to 9%, 15%, or 30%.\n\n**Ceiling -** The ceiling is a cap on the maximum amount of profit you can receive as the underlying reference asset price goes up. You are cap your upside in exchange for the buffer.\n\n*Example:* Say that the reference asset price soars by 35% but your upside cap is 30%. You would collect up to the first 30% of the reference asset\u2019s increase, and miss out on 5% of the gain.  \n\n\nWhen you combine these concepts into a defined outcome investment strategy, you can create security for your investment, even during market volatility. The contract of the defined outcome investment is set for the outcome period. You can withdraw early if the value reaches your target profit earlier. \n\n## What Are the Benefits?\n\n* **Customizable risk-return profiles**  \nWith defined outcome investing, you can personalize your risk-return profile to align with your long-term strategy. You can be conservative or aggressive.\u00a0Your buffer can be set to absorb downside volatility while keeping your cap high enough to help you reach your financial goals. Or if you're particularly bullish on an asset you can accelerate the upside in exchange for a ceiling on the profit.  \n\n* **Income Generation**  \nYou can define certain outcomes to provide a fixed return that is superior to bonds and CDs while taking a reasonable level of risk. \n\n## What kind of Outcomes Can be Achieved?\n\nThere are three main objectives that can be achieved with defined outcome investing:\u00a0  \n\n\n1. **Income / Preservation**  \n*Best for investors who want to preserve capital, even in a down market.*   \nThe preservation strategy offers maximum cushion and a fixed return. The drawback to this strategy is that the ceiling is typically lower than with other strategies. Put spreads are commonly used for this objective.   \n\u200d  \n*Example*:   \nBuy 1 $120 put  \nBuy 3 $125 puts  \n Sell 5 $135 puts    \n1/20/23 expiration   \nNets a fixed **13%** **(13%** **annualized)** unless $AAPL falls below **18%** (**$133.97**) as of 01/20/2023 \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/16b0uwj3xfe81.png?width=1428&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8081f60dde9506784f16a8a6d9a553a699e246f\n\n1. **Growth**  \n*Best for bullish investors who want to collect profits earlier*  \nThe growth strategy is on the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of risk. There is typically no downside protection, but in exchange for the ceiling you get accelerated profit.   \n*Example*:    \nBuy 2 $160 calls   \nSell 2 $170 calls   \nSell 1 $170 put    \n9/16/22 expiration   \nAccelerates gains by **3.2x** and makes up to **20.8% (34.7% annualized)** on $AAPL through 9/16/2022. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bdehv87pyfe81.png?width=1426&format=png&auto=webp&s=de7f88d8c9525f6b0c4e34aefcb5369cfc0d42ed\n\n1. **Hedged / Buffered**  \n*Best for medium risk, medium reward long term investors*   \nThis is the meeting of the two above strategies and is the most popular for defined outcome investing. You set a ceiling and a cushion that keeps your investment within parameters that match your objectives and outlook on that asset.  \n*Example*:   \nBuy 1 $160 call  \nSell 1 $185 call  \nSell 1 $140 put  \n11/18/22 expiration  \nMakes up to **18.3% (23.1% annualized)** unless $AAPL falls below **13%** (**$143.19**) as of 11/18/2022\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqd2zudvzfe81.png?width=1422&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d8fc58716a459ac00a7c1b84381812de6d4b841\n\nWould love to see a shift in how beginners approach options trading and even out the playing field.

In addition,* ***the Company intends to distribute a special dividend once a year which will bring the total annualized dividend payout to 30-50% of net income***. *On Jan 21, the CEO affirmed this policy and mentioned that the board will \\*consider\\* a share buyback program.*\n* ***Jan 2022*** *- The CEO announced a slight shift in strategy to lock in* [*12-36 month freight contracts*](https://www.joc.com/maritime-news/international-freight-shipping/new-market-dynamics-driving-demand-freight-futures_20211223.html) *related to US-Asia trade routes assuming contract rates are reasonable compared to expected future freight rates. These contracts will be based on demand (order size) and customer creditworthiness. ZIM is planning to apply this strategy to a number of charter ships it currently leases as well. The Company's goal is to lock in a \"spread\" on up to 50% of its total trade volumes which will allow ZIM to maintain a moderately high level of profitability should freight rates begin to fall while still capitalizing on inflated spot rates relating to other trade routes in the meantime.*\n\n# The Ongoing Supply Chain Disruption\n\nI'm going to assume everyone here knows there are substantial issues with the global supply chain. Thanks to the current bottleneck, freight rates are sky high and ZIM and other marine shippers are generating record profits. To be brief, the key factors driving the disruption are:\n\n* Record high demand (particularly from the U.S.) resulting from massive stimulus in 2020\n* Slow supply catch-up given a near total shut-down of the global supply chain in 2020\n* Global dependence on a relatively small number of overseas manufacturers\n* Labor shortages, port congestion, and poor logistics throughout the global supply chain network\n* Lack of effective global policies in place to help actively alleviate the disruption\n\nFor those who are not savvy on the subject, there is much discussion to be had on the supply chain bottleneck so I've included additional sources for you to look into at the end of this DD.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# FINANCIAL ANALYSIS\n\n**Historical & Projected Financials**\n\n[Observe strong Net Income projections but also Free Cash Flow to better reflect how much cash may be distributed to ZIM's 118.6mln shareholders.](https://preview.redd.it/aojes991ode81.jpg?width=939&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f512ff7f7c5454dd74f564a87f76b500894b607)\n\nI'm copy/pasting estimates as I mostly agree with Bloomberg especially on the 2021 estimates as those should be quite accurate given how close we are to FYE 2021. Effects of the supply chain disruption are expected to persist through the rest of 2022 but Bloomberg is pricing in an inevitable decrease in freight rates which will lower ZIM's margins. This is evidenced by the peak in margins expected for FYE 2021 followed by a reversion to levels reported in the LTM Sep 30, 2021 financials:\n\n|**amts in USD Millions**|**LTM SEP 30, 2021**|**FYE 2021 Est.**|**FYE 2022 Est.**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Revenue|$8,623|$10,538|$10,487|\n|EBITDA / *Margin %*|$4,455 / *51.7%*|$6,368 / *60.4%*|$5,761 / *54.9%*|\n|Free Cash Flow / %|$2,575 / *29.9%*|$3,967 / *37.7%*|$3,411 / *32.5%*|\n\n*Note that while margins may at some point fall to levels seen pre 2021, the purpose of this trade is to collect a very high yield as long as it's offered to shareholders (until the global supply chain normalizes) while enjoying some substantial potential upside in the stock price based on valuations of ZIM's industry peers.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# MULTIPLES ANALYSIS\n\n*The metrics shown below should be considered the most relevant when conducting a multiples analysis. For the sake of conciseness of this DD, if you want to know why enterprise value and free cash flow ratios are used versus the frequently referenced P/E, P/S, etc, see the references I've included at the end.*\n\n|METRIC|LTM SEP 30, 2021|Est. FYE DEC 31, 2021|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|EV/Revenue|1.1x|0.4x|\n|EV/EBITDA|2.1x|0.6x|\n|Debt/EBITDA|0.6x|0.4x|\n|Net Debt/EBITDA|0.1x|No Net Debt|\n|**EV/FCF (preferred to P/E)**|**2.1x**|**0.9x**|\n|***FCF/EV (FCF Yield)***|***47.1%***|***107.9%***|\n\n**Assumptions for FYE Dec 31, 2021**\n\n* Bloomberg estimates for Revenue, EBITDA, and FCF are used\n* No change in debt for simplicity (some debt will surely be paid down but you can see why it doesn't matter for the observed period)\n* Enterprise Value assumes no change in stock price\n\nFor the uninitiated, these financials and multiples are OUTSTANDING for a marine shipping company or any company for that matter. The FCF Yield (FCF/EV - my preferred substitute to P/E) demonstrates how much actual cash (versus reported Net Income) will be available to shareholders relative to the enterprise value of the company (versus P or market cap which doesn't account for debt). Based on this metric, **we can reasonably conclude that ZIM is considerably undervalued even compared to its peers.**\n\nSpeaking of peers, let's see how ZIM's financial strength holds up against the rest of the industry.\n\n# \n\n# Comparables\n\n[Bloomberg's comparables analysis uses blended multiples which reflect a combination of historical and forward expected earnings.](https://preview.redd.it/85z8k7w3ode81.jpg?width=1012&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7d3e4b0a6d50247c8cd254ff4048c8148cc3fd5)\n\nAside from a relatively high P/B (mostly due to ZIM's **215% ROE for LTM Sep 30, 2021**), ZIM's multiples are clearly superior to its comps. If we apply the means of key multiples (circled above), EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, and P/BV to ZIM's valuation, we can estimate a more appropriate stock price than what it's currently trading at. Note that while using P/BV seems to only serve the purpose of lowering ZIM's price target, let's assume there is a possibility ZIM's value could revert to the mean P/BV of the industry and consider its use as an attempt to be more conservative when estimating the stock price. I would typically use FCF/EV as well but the difference between ZIM and its comps is laughable and would only create an unrealistic amount of skew in the multiples valuation (as if that isn't already apparent in the figures below).\n\n|VALUATION METHOD|Price Target|Applied Weighting|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|EV/Revenue (3.6x mean)|$259|*30%*|\n|EV/EBITDA (5.5x mean)|$204|*30%*|\n|P/BV (4.0x mean)|$23|*40%*|\n|FINAL PRICE TARGET|**$148**|*100%*|\n\nTHAT'S A BIT RIDICULOUS. So let's attempt to be even more conservative and consider the possibility that the supply chain bottleneck diminishes sooner than expected, resulting in a lower expected cash flow for 2022. To be *very* conservative, we'll **apply a 30% margin of safety**:\n\n# Multiples based Price Target w/30% MoS: $103.60\n\nFinally, let's look at the expected dividend and include that in our calculation of potential profit. We'll use a sensitivity analysis to see what we can expect based on estimated profits and the proposed 30-50% annualized dividend:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ym7od66ode81.png?width=726&format=png&auto=webp&s=ec84017b63187935abfcce4cad498702d99792fe\n\nBloomberg's estimated Net Income (top left of each chart) is multiplied by the percentage of what is actually generated. This is then multiplied by the proposed dividend payout as a percentage and finally divided by the total 118.6mln shares outstanding.\n\nBased on results in line with Bloomberg's estimates and accounting for the $2 and $2.5 dividend payments already distributed, we can expect the 4Q dividend to be anywhere from $3 to $14 per share. As I prefer to be conservative, let's assume the actual **4Q dividend will be close to $11 at the 30% payout ratio**. Let's assume the same for the current year and we can **expect total dividends for 2022 to amount to $9-10 per share**...\n\n# Expected 4Q + FY 2022 Div per Share: $20 or more\n\n# \n\n# RISKS\n\n* Easing Supply Chain Disruption Over Time (inevitable at some point) - Estimated timeframe unknown but expected by the industry to last until at least 2023. Will result in decreasing freight rates and lower profits for ZIM.\n* Substantial Drop in Demand in 2022 - Could result from drop in U.S. consumer purchasing power (which remains high despite inflation) or a global economic crisis.\n* Active Clearing of Distribution Bottleneck (highly unlikely) - May result from efficient domestic and foreign policy (lmao) addressing current congestion of marine shipping and land transportation of goods.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# TL;DR - PT of $104 w/expected Div of $20+ for 100% 1-Yr Gains\n\n* The supply chain bottleneck will persist for another year\n* ZIM will yield massive profits on share upside and 30-50% dividend payout\n* **Recommended trade based on risk tolerance:**\n\n|RISK TOLERANCE|STRATEGY|\n|:-|:-|\n|Classical Economist Boomer Virgin|Buy & Hold Shares w/100% ATM Covered Calls|\n|Game Recognize Game|Buy & Hold Shares, OTM CCs on 33-50% of pos|\n|Poor Retard Margin Called Last Week|Just fkn buy the shares|\n\nNow buy some shares, wait for fat profits, relax, sit back, and listen to some [good music like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_XJ_s5IsQc) because apparently [that makes the markets go up](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X21003718?via%3Dihub).\n\n\\*\\***EDIT - Thanks to** u/cashbackpal **for reminding me about the 25% foreign div tax.
