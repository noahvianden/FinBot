You only live once, so take advantage of your ever growing equity and use that cash for a new car, home improvement, the market even.  Well, even the slightest of interest rates will kill that movement as rates were already low pre-covid.  If housing demand slows on rising rates and prices drop, there will be a substantial amount of underwater loans.  Same can be said for autos.  People were/are financing 100%+ the value for vehicles.  My point is that rate increases will have a huge impact on consumer and producer demand and will in fact correct some of the accelerated inflation. \n\nFrom stock perspective:  so many businesses, not just tech have been able to cope with the current situation by price increases. If rates increase and debt becomes more expensive, growth will slow and earnings will suffer.
