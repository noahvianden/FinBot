I'm honestly asking how you think the competing dynamics will play out.\n\nThe Fed hasn't even begun quantitative tightening. They're still just easing less. They have announced their plans to stop buying bonds by March, sell the bonds they've bought, and raise interest rates starting in March. In response, investors are taking their gains and storing up cash. Big players have oodles of cash on hand. Berkshire Hathaway openly started building their war chest at least a year ago and had 149 billion in cash on hand last November. The FAANGs have 100s of billions of cash on hand. The Fed's Reverse Repo is at 1.7 Trillion dollars with Fidelity being the largest and JP Morgan, Blackrock, Vanguard, et al. being other noteworthy counterparties. \n\nThere is an enormous amount of margin debt that needs to get covered, but there is also an enormous amount of cash on the sidelines. I'm not talking about the \"buy the dip\" crowd who did fantastic the last two years but are getting hit hard now. I'm talking about the big dogs who have been waiting patiently for their opportunities.

I'd recommend digging through the dotcom bubble crash most of all for big long drawn out crashes. 2008 crippled the entire economy, 2000 hurt some, but did not reflect the economy at the time. 1929 is actually different this time. Yeah, that big of a fall is always a possibility, but the mechanics that allowed that specific one to happen are not. I have not studied other crashes, just miscellaneous corrections and pullbacks.\n\nWhere we are now gives us a few different options:\n\nwe can either see a decent bounce in the overall market before seeing the indexes reject that bounce, typically around a moving average, though not always, and come back down. Probably to a price lower than where they bounced.\n\n\nWe can plummet with a few green days mixed in, but really no big bounce. This is a bit more rare, but a possibility. \n\nIn more recent fashion, we can V-shape and be at SPY 500 in 2-3 months.\n\nWe can chop and mostly just go sideways before either moving up or making another leg down.\n\nThe first and last ones are most common. \n\nSay that we do continue down, what's next? After we bottom, we either see a recovery rally, maybe some chop or sideways, maybe even a decent pullback, then more rally. \n\nOr we enter bear territory. We still rally, though they aren't as strong. If you're a swing trader, you can still find stocks making big moves during this time though. That rally turns into a bunch of chop, then it rolls over to go back down, then another mediocre rally that turns into chop before heading back down. That process just repeats itself.\n\nThe movements of downfalls are often very similar. For specifics, I can only really provide basic examples from 2000. The indices peaked around March 2000. A good amount of the most speculative stuff peaked well before that though. Your Intels, Ciscos, etc..., some of those peaked many months after the indexes did. Some non tech names weren't impacted at all because it wasn't something that crippled the economy itself.\n\nThe market went through constant rotations into different sectors, actually only providing 1 three month  window where none of the sectors went up. You theoretically could have never taken a single short position and made money almost the entire time from 2000 to 2003.\n\nThe nasdaq continuously made legs lower. Whether that be from consolidation after a previous leg down or a choppy rollover from an attempted rally, when it broke, it resembled the performance of SQ over the past few months. Bounces up around the 10 day moving average, maybe even 20, then just straight back down and down fast.\n\nIn most situations, if you're looking for technical setups to go long or thinking the market is done falling, you're probably going to be early a few times before you're correct. Some situations are a bit more nuanced for seeing when we may continue back down and potentially wanting to add short exposure if you actively trade. Often still looking for rejections, but it's not a steady trend like the 2000 and 2001 breakdowns of the nasdaq or growth stocks last year if you want a recent comparison. This is outside of a true bear market. Those can last years and most commonly feature rally, chop, rollover.\n\nOf course nothing is guaranteed, but these macro movements are very common in the majority of market downtrends.\n\nFor anyone actively trading on a shorter time frame, like trying to swing anywhere from a few days to a few months, I'd recommend just sitting out and staying afloat until the market at least appears to be actually rallying again. Let the nasdaq recover the 10 day sma at a minimum.\n\nThe money isn't made timing a small bounce, nor is it made in the first few days of the rally from timing the bottom.
