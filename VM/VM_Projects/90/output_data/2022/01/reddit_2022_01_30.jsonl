People don't seem to understand how utterly complex stocking a grocery shelf is.\n\n>But true to the video it got me thinking. You don't need general AI for the Optimus to work as a glorified forklift. You give it the Programming so it knows how to move itself, then stick in say an Amazon warehouse and provide it a program so it knows where everything in the warehouse is and let it get to work.\n\nThis is such a naive thing to say. There's so many reasons why you actually need an AI for stocking something so basic as stocking a grocery shelf.\n\n\\---\n\n1. Your brain is doing geospatial calculations in realtime in parallel. It's recognizing the entire world, then the shelf, then the distance between the shelf (destination) and the source (where the items are; kart, carton, etc.).\n2. You can *easily* inference relative depth and if you miss, just compensate by moving your hand around until you find the kart/carton, whatever, then reach in and get the next item. In robotics, where everything is binary behavior, this is not a thing; not yet.\n3. The amount of distance you'll crouch, stand, lean, hunch over, all happens in the span of a matter of miliseconds. Energy requirements, actuation of muscles, dexterity of how much they should move, all happens simultaneously across your body in your core and back. Double that for whether your legs pivot at all or not on whether you decide you're going back for one item or several.\n4. Double this for using fingers; are you going to grip the top? are you going to grip the side? What if the can or box falls over; how are you going to grasp it? What is the best way to grasp it without damaging it? Can you even pick it up?\n5. With humans, you can stock anywhere from 1 to N number of objects simultaneously. You can pick them up look away and keep stocking it. Your brain having seen the object once can approximate location on the shelf and whether the object's label is centered or not ***without*** having to look at it each time. You can place a box on a shelf and rotate it to be directionally accurate without any direct visual input. A robot simply cannot do that, not yet.\n6. It's like when you're done brushing your teeth and you put your toothbrush back into its charging cable without needing to look at it or how after a shower, you having placed your towel on a rack behind the curtain, can automatically reach for it without needing to directly look at it. Or how after you're done lathering your body with soap and your face and eyes are covered in suds, that you can put away the soap in its holder without dropping it or breaking the walls trying to put it away, because you know exactly ***where*** on the wall it is (and your brain is fully aware of your location in the shower, taking in the input from the water and discarding it, doing geospatial calculations in realtime).\n7. On top of that, all of the above involves a crazy amount of retrieving data from short term memory into other parts of the brain to then act on it for the exact task you are currently doing, and then for everything missing either is doing another memory call to short term or even long-term memory faster than you can snap your fingers and then being able to act on that data within the same amount of time.\n\nThe list of things you need to do all at **once** in order to stock a single can on a shelf is \\^ + 100 more things and they all need to happen in the time it takes for you to raise your hand and snap your fingers. This:\n\n>You give it the Programming so it knows how to move itself, then stick in say an Amazon warehouse and provide it a program so it knows where everything in the warehouse is and let it get to work.\n\nis about a 1,000 different *things* that a computer needs to solve, that your brain does cause its been evolving for 65 million years and has such a massive head start on things you take for granted.

And when the cars drive they use lidar/GPS/cameras/etc. to position themselves in that map, and then they go about figuring what else is happening in the world and how to get to their destination and navigate around traffic/obstacles/etc.\n\nTesla's FSD does use map data, but mostly just for navigation, the same way a human does. And it does seem like, at least sometimes, they use additional data like the what lanes there are, where stoplights and stop signs are, etc. But this is very low fidelity data, and the cars can usually drive fine even when mapping data is wrong (for example because of construction, or if the gps data is wrong).\n\nYou can plop a Tesla down anywhere and it can look at the roads and do a pretty good job figuring out what the world looks like, where it can drive, what it should do, etc. As far as I know Tesla is the only company that's even attempting something like this, and they're making very good progress on this incredibly hard problem.\n\nNow think about how those two approaches would work for a robot stocking store shelves:\n\n* If you need to map out the store in detail ahead of time, that makes things pretty complicated, you have to put in a lot of effort to even get one bot working.

AMZN can actually be a great source of profit with put credit spreads (or I suppose naked puts but with more attention than you gave the position). \n\n\nI always open at least $200 OTM (which you did at first) - however if the price comes within $80 of my strike, I'll roll down and out, reset my distance of $200 away from current price. \n\n\nAlternatively, you could hedge your position using things like butterfly spreads (for example, when AMZN was closing in on 3100, you could have opened a 3030/3060/3090 butterfly (puts or calls doesn't matter), expiring the same week, for probably $1-200 debit. This is a low risk/high reward/ low profit probability play (so good complementary hedge for a high risk, low reward, high profit probability play). If you had done this, when amazon did move below 3100, into the 3000's territory, you would have made around $3k, which should at least have put a dent in the losses from the put going up in value. \n\n\nI like butterflies because they are less expensive than buying a single put as a hedge, so say if AMZN ended up moving back into safe territory, you'd be out the $2-300 debit you paid for the butterfly, but your bigger position, which undoubtedly will end up netting you more than a couple hundred bucks if successful, would be safe. \n\n\nIn the future, I'd use the roll down and out if price moves within x distance of strike, butterfly hedge, or shit even both (i.e. take the profit from the butterfly, also roll down and out for more safety). \n\n\nYou don't have to sit there and just watch your position go to shit.

A 1/28 exp, 3000/3050/3100 call butterfly was worth about $300 on 1/18, and had you opened that as a hedge for it dropping below 3100, you'd have been able to close that position for a gain of about $5000 on Friday 1/21, as an example of a hedge that would have helped. If AMZN hadn't dropped more and recovered, that hedge would have cost you just $300 out of your overall premium. \n\n\nOn 1/18 you could also have rolled down to 2950p (to stay 200 points away from the current price), and then would have had to roll again once it went down below 3070, but with those two rolls, you'd have kept your delta /gamma exposure to a minimum, and kept your naked put OTM, and would be in a much less stressful position right now.
