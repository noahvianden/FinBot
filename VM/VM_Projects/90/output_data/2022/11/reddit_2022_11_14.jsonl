{"title": "I want peoples opinions on $TSLA", "selftext": "*Short term noise*\n\n$TSLA has fallen ~50% from ath mostly due to raising rates and all that shit but more recently the blue bird and Elon selling shares to feed the bird. \n\nThe twitter purchase is annoying to me for 3 reasons. It takes away Elons time, its already cost a lot of $TSLA stock and he might end up selling more, and it\u2019s causing uproar and extra downward pressure on the stock. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s short term noise. Elon could sell all 420 million shares or whatever he owns and nothing would happen to Tesla the company longterm. \n\nElon has been more erratic than usual lately, maybe it\u2019s stress maybe he\u2019s actually losing it. Maybe the power is going to his head, or it might just all be an act. Some of those are more likely than other of course, I\u2019ll leave that there. Worst case Elon sells all his shares, tanking the stock and probably getting booted from the CEO spot. Idk if that\u2019s actually how that works but regardless, Tesla would still be okay longterm. In my personal opinion, I think Elon is important to the company. I understand why some disagree, but that\u2019s not what I\u2019m debating here. \n\n*\u201dDD\u201d*\n\nTesla recently hit a PE of 56 with a forward PE of 35. Their last 3 quarters of earnings were $8.87b total, with a below average Q2 due to covid shutdowns in China. Q2 was only $2.26b in earnings, so if we assume tesla earns at least that (meaning negative growth Q/Q) 2022 will have earnings of $11.13b. 2021 and 2020 earnings were $5.52b and $721m. That will be another year of 100%+ earnings growth Y/Y. For reference the SP500 current and forward PE are ~19.5 and ~17, growth ~5-10%. \n\nSo Tesla is growing and expected to grow earnings ~10x more than the SP500 but is only trading with a PE ~2x. This seems flawed to me. I have done screening and some comparison, but I\u2019m sure some of you could say otherwise. \n\nTesla is a car company, but it\u2019s also much more. Not only are they leaders within the car industry they are outliers. VW CEO stated the model 3 is made 3x faster than their more efficient factory. The MIC vehicles are sold at ~30% margin, recently dropped to about ~27% to meet Chinese incentives. That\u2019s ~20% higher than the industrial average *for ICE vehicles* which have higher margins than EV in general for legacy auto. In the US they are ~15% higher than the industry average. They have next to no debt, no dealership model, mobile service which depending on the state is very good or very bad but eventually it will be very good everywhere. If you look at Tesla without the name and not knowing what they sell they don\u2019t look like a car maker. \n\nPeople love to talk about build quality. Clearly it\u2019s not effecting sales but regardless it\u2019s getting better and it\u2019s actually good in China. And if you think this is a non fixable issues you\u2019re delusional, it\u2019s just not a priority. Cars are still selling, as soon as this changes it will become a priority. \n\nCheap interior is cheap in cost, and far from \u201cluxury\u201d but it\u2019s durable and practical. For $50k it\u2019s understandable why not everyone loves it, and why some think it\u2019s unacceptable. Not a real issue imo, if it starts reflecting in a loss of sales (after demand drops blow supply) they can easily add some leather and drop margins to make everyone happy again. I don\u2019t see demand dropping below supply longterm anytime soon, especially with cheaper models being announced. \n\nFord has only had earnings 1 of 3 quarters this year Q2 667m. Forward PE of 7.4, a mountain of debt, transitioning into a new manufacturing process while also scaling down another, low margins, but they are scaling EV production well. Aiming to hit 600k run-rate by 2023. \n\nVW has also put in serious work and has expanded quickly but their numbers are easy to get confused as they tend to combine hybrid and EV sales. They\u2019re earnings have shrunk every quarter of this year. PE and forward of ~5. Selling 366k in the last 9 months, so we\u2019ll assume 500k for the year and growth is ~25% Y/Y. \n\nTesla can pay off debt with 1/4th of its cash on hand, has industry leading margins 15-20% higher than industry average, and are aiming to grow production at ~50% over the next couple years which they are on track to do. \u201cSome years will be a little less some will be a little more.\u201d Giga Shanghai, one of four Giga factories has a run-rate of 1 million alone. \n\nSo the best US manufacturers are shrinking while Tesla is growing production and earnings at ~50% and ~100%. Yet Tesla is trading at ~5x industry av, remember what happened last time we saw economic downturn like this legacy did not do well. \n\nThe economy is not doing great regardless of what the ice cream man says. Less people will be buying shit they don\u2019t need, but generally luxury items perform better than regular consumer goods. The people that were stretching to afford a $50k+ car probably won\u2019t be buying in these climates. But someone that had no issue buying will still be buying. Even if it\u2019s worse than we thought and way less people are buying cars, who\u2019s going to last longer, a shrinking non profitable legacy auto company or a small lean extremely profitable Tesla? Obviously tesla will perform better in those climates.\n\nChina is a threat to domination, not success. BYD has officially passed tesla in overall sales, and are doing extremely well. They\u2019re moving into Europe, I don\u2019t see them moving to North American markets soon. It\u2019s very easy to do EVs in China thanks to the CCP, and they\u2019re growing extremely fast due to soft regulations and a huge market. I think at least BYD will be a major player longterm and possibly NIO. I\u2019d buy their stock if they weren\u2019t IOUs from the CCP. \n\nI haven\u2019t even touched on their energy business which is growing well and has a new factory ramping, I didn\u2019t include  FSD because it\u2019s not close to being solved but I strongly believe Tesla has set themselves up the best to do it, and I don\u2019t consider the sex bot for multiple reasons. Regardless of not including them any one of these has the potential to be worth more than the car business. \n\nTLDR: Tesla has so much room to grow longterm, they\u2019re an outlier and leader within the car industry with a forward PE of only 35 and earnings growth ~100% I strongly believe it has upside potential even in these market conditions.\n\nPosition 33.69 shares (ik I\u2019m poor).", "id": "yuln4j", "created_utc": 1668390923.0, "score": 0, "upvote_ratio": 0.46, "num_comments": 86, "comments": [{"body": "What you said about luxury goods performing well in recessions is pretty inaccurate particularly at scale.
