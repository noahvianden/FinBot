{"title": "GM expects EV profits to be comparable to gas vehicles by 2025, years ahead of schedule", "selftext": "*  **General Motors expects its new electric vehicles to be in-line with traditional cars and trucks with internal combustion engines by mid-decade.**\n* **GM CEO Mary Barra on Thursday said the significant increase in profits factors in federal incentives under the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act**\n* **That timeframe is years ahead of schedule and what many expected was possible.**\n\nGeneral Motors expects its new electric vehicles to be in-line with traditional cars and trucks with internal combustion engines by 2025 \u2013 years ahead of schedule and what many expected was possible.\n\nGM CEO Mary Barra on Thursday said the significant increase in profits factors in federal incentives under the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, which includes money back for companies that produce EVs in North America as well as consumers and fleet customers that purchase the vehicles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear these credits are going to help usher in a new era of technology innovation and job creation that\u2019s going to achieve what was intended,\u201d Barra said during an investor day in New York. \u201cIt will be good for the American economy. It\u2019ll be good for American families. It\u2019ll be good for the environment, and frankly, General Motors is well poised.\u201d\n\nNear-term profitability plans for EVs as well as its outlooks for the economy and business during a period of rising interest rates, surging inflation and recessionary fears were expected to be focus points for investors and analysts during the event in New York.\n\nGM is bullish on its profits and plans regarding EVs largely thanks to its investments in recent years on a new vehicle platform called Ultium as well as ongoing construction of domestic plants through a joint venture called Ultium Cells LLC with LG Energy Solution.\n\nThe joint venture is expected to be operating plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan by the end of 2024, which would make the company a leader in domestic cell production; a fourth U.S. cell plant is planned.\n\nWells Fargo Colin M. Langan is \u201cskeptical\u201d that GM\u2019s electric vehicles can be sustainably profitable by 2025, even with incentives in the Biden administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act. He said pricing and raw material assumptions will be key.\n\n\u201cAt the last Investor Day, GM promised ICE-like EV margins by 2030. Since then, battery raw material costs have dramatically spiked; therefore, it would be surprising if GM can still see EV profitability by 2025,\u201d Langan wrote Tuesday.\n\nGM previously said it secured binding commitments for all the battery raw material it needs to deliver its 2025 electric vehicle capacity target of 1 million vehicles. The company also has plans for capacity of 1 million EVs in China by then as well.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/gm-investor-day-ev-guidance-updates.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/gm-investor-day-ev-guidance-updates.html)", "id": "yxxqo8", "created_utc": 1668710094.0, "score": 285, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 95, "comments": [{"body": "Accountants at GM:\n\nOkay so right now we\u2019re making 12 hummers per day and they\u2019re selling at a $100,000 mark up.
