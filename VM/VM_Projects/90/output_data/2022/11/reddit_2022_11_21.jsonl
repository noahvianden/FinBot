Just fluff  \nSo, the landscape is extremely difficult to explain, but this entire deflationary period will take years, with higher highs and lower lows in the market- See 1970s, which coincidentally involved an inflation roller coaster. It's technically a bear market rally, but I see it hitting ATH in 2023  before an insanely violent flash crash. I have an idea of what it will do after, but timing/forecasting that is pointless right now. So when people say \"bear market rally\" I laugh because unless you know wtf you're doing, this will delete your account.  \nEvery 6-12 months since 2020 bottom Fed has created rotations in sectors- small caps/memes went first year w/stimulus/low cpi, then cyclicals/other sectors in 2021 w/ moderate cpi, then Nov. 2021 was \"EVERYTHING dies\" b/c Fed finally pivoted/CPI shot up. On Nov 10th, 2022, the \"Everything\" rally was triggered. Literally everything will rally including Ark/memes, which is triggered by CPI decreasing M/M. It's all algos. Jpow is hawkish, but if CPI comes down, market prices IN the PAUSE, not pivot(yet), and that's all the market needs to rally short term. That's how everything rotated on the way up with CPI. So this is how it will play out as CPI comes lower- you can even see this from technicals in all the ARK/meme stocks, they all look to rally from here on out. So these cycles usually last 6 months. up to 12. There's a ton of confluence for April/May top at ATH with Jan/Fed dip. \n\nThat's the brief fundamental view, the technical view is extremely bullish into Dec/Jan. I want to see 430-450 on SPY. Expecting that short term top Jan/Feb(which may or may not be the big flash crash I see coming-it depends how high we go but still think we flash crash from ATH- so I will be short either way briefly), then on to ATH.  \nIf you expect to be \"fully long\" or \"Fully cash\" next 3-5 years it's gonna be a huge fucking nightmare. Lots of volatility, lots of headfakes. The goal is to be in the sectors that will outperform in that 6-12 month period. 23-24 will be really good to biotech, small caps.
