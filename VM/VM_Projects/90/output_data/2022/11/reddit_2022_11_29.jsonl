That marked the end of an era and the beginning of the true fiat currency completely detached from a peg on real goods.\n\nThe detachment of the dollar from gold was a monumental change compared to moving the inflation target from 2% to 3%. Let's not forget that such a 2% target was first introduced in 1996 and officially adopted in 2012 with Ben Bernanke. It doesn't represent anything in itself...it's not something that existed for centuries or a special number that hold everything together.\n\nIt the FED manage to lower inflation to around 3,5% thanks to reducing commodities prices, food prices, rent ecc but the job market won't budge it's possible that they decide to leave it there because the cost of getting below 2% through a job market collapse (and stock market collapse) is much higher than a 1% change in inflation.\n\nA 3% inflation target would also benefit the Government because the massive debt we have will be devalued at a higher inflation rate and so in real value it will be lower.", "score": 70, "replies": [{"body": "I also think people have forgotten that globalization is not dead.

It's basically just to give businesses and consumers some certainty around their purchase and investment decisions. Because without some certainty about where prices will be in the future it's hard to make financial decisions in the present.\n\nHowever, perhaps the only thing that hurts growth more than inflation uncertainty, is monetary policy uncertainty. If you can't be sure the Fed isn't going to rug pull your investment portfolio or the value of your house then you're probably not going to invest. In 2021 those who trusted central bankers when they said they wouldn't aggressively tighten policy in 2022 are those who were hurt the worst, and this doesn't promote much long-term confidence in US monetary policy.\n\nI'd argue that most investors and businesses today are far less worried about whether inflation is going to be 2% or 8% in a year's time and instead are more focused on the path of monetary policy. And if we are talking about inflation it's typically only in relation to the Fed's reaction function and not on it's direct impact on our investments. The risk is clearly not 5% inflation, but the Fed.\n\nData suggests economies can do fine with slightly higher rates of inflation (2-8%). It's really only when it goes above double digits that we begin to see negative impacts. Therefore it seems to me a goal of monetary policy should be predictability of its long-term policy and this should be balanced with inflation targeting and unemployment.\n\nI think we can all argue that the Fed needs to do something if inflation is double digits, but if it's 3% do we really need to \"fix\" that by making people unemployed and tanking retirement accounts? Being so fixated on a hard 2% target imo just erodes confidence in monetary policy because without some flexibility it makes hard landings that much more likely.\n\nMy working assumption is that the Fed is incompetent though so I don't expect them to budge at all from their 2% target, even temporarily.", "score": 6, "replies": [{"body": ">Data suggests economies can do fine with slightly higher rates of inflation (2-8%). \n\nLove to see that data. 8% inflation is fine please lower the rates it will stay here please Jpowell.

Just Google something like \"inflation and economic growth\" on Google Scholar and decide for yourself if what I'm saying is accurate. From what I've read economists generally agree low single digits is ideal, although typically you don't see much of an impact on growth until inflation gets into the low double digits.\n\nBut I think you're missing my point... I'm not saying to lower rates at this point, or that 8% inflation is fine. I'm saying that predictable monetary policy is important for consumer and investment confidence in the same way predictable inflation is.\n\nTherefore it makes sense to have a slightly looser inflation target if it lowers the chance of a shock to monetary policy. What should have happened in a ideal world is that the Fed should have been more cautious about stimulus in 2020. Then raised rates 2021 through 2022, but at a much slower pace.\n\nIt's the shocks that cause problems in economics because shock events are hard to manage risk around. And for that reason reducing shock events in general tends to be a good thing in economics. That's really all I'm saying here.\n\nThe Fed shouldn't have come in with such shocking stimulus in 2020 allowing for huge asset bubbles to develop, then shocked everyone by allowing inflation to remain extremely elevated while holding rates unreasonable low in 2021, then shocked everyone by tightening monetary policy faster than at any time in history in 2022.

{"title": "META - The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated", "selftext": "I think it's fair to say that social media is at the moment one of the few topics where most of the population can agree to hate on. In this post I would like to deconstruct a few popular myths about Facebook/META and give my personal opinion on how I think the public image of this company has gone from bad to worse in recent history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMyth 1 - META is selling your data to advertisers.\n\nI think this is a common misconception that a lot of people make simply because it's easy/convenient to understand META's business model like this. But reality is that META has NEVER sold any of its users data to advertisers in any of the platforms under its umbrella. Instead, when advertisers want their ads to be displayed on Facebook/Instagram, they request a target audience(things like age, occupation, interests, political orientation etc.) and pay META money. After the contract is signed, META will then use its internal algorithms and data to efficiently and accurately target ads requested by the advertiser. No personal data is transferred between META and the advertiser.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne thing to add to this section is about the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2014. Facebook was not without blame of course, but they are not the main culprit. A third party app called ' This Is Your Digital Life ' improperly harvested data on 87 million Facebook users and then used that data for gaining political advantage in different election races. Facebook is guilty of improperly protecting their users data. Cambridge Analytica was basically doing the stealing while Facebook had a security issue.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMyth 2 - No one is using Facebook anymore. Or at least people are leaving META's platforms in droves.\n\nThis is simply factually wrong. Global MAUs(Monthly Active Users) and DAUs(Daily Active Users) have been increasing every quarter since IPO. It is true that a slight decline started happening in Europe, while USA and Canada growth has basically stagnated(because already almost anyone is on one of the platforms). But META's reach is much beyond that. I cannot add images in this subreddit, but you can verify this yourself by searching for the MAU/DAU graphs in the last Q3 release.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMyth 3 - META is investing all they have into the Metaverse.\n\nThis is again factually incorrect. Here is a direct quote from the CEO in the last conference call:\n\n\"We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q3, Family of Apps expenses were $18.1 billion, representing 82% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses grew 18% driven mostly by employee-related costs, infrastructure-related costs, and the impairment of certain operating leases for office facilities that we plan to exit. Our current surge in capex is largely due to building out our AI infrastructure and we would expect capex to come down as a percent of revenue over the long term. \"\n\nWe can clearly see that only 18% of expenses are directed to VR/AR aka the Realty Labs segment(also the nature of these expenses is that they should come down over time and margins will improve again). The rest of the expenses are going into the traditional apps like Facebook/Instagram/Messenger/Whatsapp.\n\nPeople think that Zuckerberg and his team are lunatics that will throw the whole company in jeopardy because of some dream Zuckerberg had about VR/AR. Don't forget these guys have built a gigantic company with more than 3.6 BILLION users worldwide. They have also bought Instagram and Whatsapp(people were criticizing FB back when these acquisitions were made  ) and built them out into behemoths as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMyth 4 - META is dying, financially speaking.\n\nWhile it is true that recent earning releases were lackluster, people seem to not think about the cyclicality of the advertising business. Given the current economic struggles and the projected global recession incoming, do you know how majority of business cut their expenses?  At the top of the list is cutting advertising budgets. Add to this the recent iOS privacy changes and of course META has been struggling to show growth(especially after the increased growth after the pandemic).\n\nZuckerberg has already mentioned that the next leg in revenue growth will not be the Metaverse, but monetizing Messenger and Whatsapp:\n\n' Beyond Reels, messaging is another major monetization opportunity. Billions of people and millions of businesses use WhatsApp and Messenger every day, and we're confident we can connect them in ways that create valuable experiences. We started with Click-to-Messaging ads, which let businesses run ads on Facebook and Instagram that start a thread on Messenger, WhatsApp or Instagram Direct so they can communicate with customers directly. This is one of our fastest growing ads products, with a $9 billion annual run rate. This revenue is mostly on Click-to-Messenger today since we started there first, but Click-to-WhatsApp just passed a $1.5 billion run rate, growing more than 80% year-over-year. '\n\nAlso, the metaverse doesn't have to take over the world in order for it to become a profitable investment.  Reality Labs has been mostly growing since 2020(at a loss) and only this year has META released the new VR headset . The growth is there, it can become profitable in the future and it doesn't mean that all of us will walk around with VR headsets and buy property in the Metaverse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConcluding thoughts - How did META's reputation got so bad?\n\nLet me begin this by saying that I am in no way absolving META of any blame, they made/make mistakes. Their algorithms work in such a way that it brings to the surface some of the most over the top and toxic people/takes. It creates echo chambers that keeps its users engaged/addicted to its apps. At the same time I understand that the benefits that META brings to this planet, cannot come without the downsides, especially if you want to be using its services for free. You,the user, have to accept the terms and conditions that you will be the product.\n\nI am not one to believe in conspiracy theories, I like to critically think why/how events unfold. Do you know who is also a player in the ad industry? Traditional media. It is in their direct interest if METAs public image is bad and advertisers pull their money out of META and give it to them. Same can also be said about Apple(they don't give a rat's ass about your privacy, they just want to get a bigger share of the advertising pie themselves ).\n\nWhile so many other outlets will be benefiting from META's demise, it's easy to understand why a constant flow of bad news/coverage is coming towards META to destroy its reputation(worse than any other FAAMG company).\n\nBecause so many of us are using META and we all can see the glaring issues with its platforms, it's easy to hop onto a blind hate bandwagon that impairs our financial decision of whether to buy/not buy META stock without looking at the huge investing opportunity META is at its current prices.\n\nEDIT:\n\nSome people in the comments completely disregard the possibility of this being a great investment decision for the long term. Perhaps META being the most bought stock by superinvestors(great investors) in the last two quarters will make some to look past their biases.

On top of that, TikTok represents a political risk and could see further bans in some countries(US for example), but this is just speculation.\n\nAlso, people are underestimating Instagram Reels, around 91% of Instagram users are using Reels. This is META's direct response to TikTok. They had a similar approach with Facebook/Instagram stories in order to counter Snapchat, and look where Snapchat is today. It's fair to say META won the battle with Snapchat for the moment at least, and it will surely not let TikTok get ahead without a fight at least.\n\nRegarding the fines, all these big companies get fined all the time.
