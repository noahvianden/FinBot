Basically at the dimensions we are talking about mostly most designs have to follow very strict rules specified by a specific fab. For example the number of layers of metal that can be used to route wires between transistors or the capacitive and resistive properties of such layers. A typical design would take anywhere from 12 to 24 months to move between fabs. Very few vendors use multi-fab strategy. This becomes even more complex when it comes to packaging and testing and certifications etc. Automotive chips have even more requirements on the fab and process used in order to work at very high temperature or reliability and very few fabs are capable of taking on this. So you are looking at a supply chain bottleneck of up to a decade of huge capital investments before someone like INTEL will see real bottom line benefits of having wiped out TSMC. You can look back at what happened during the Fukushima earthquake. A little know fact was that a large percentage of silicon substrates that most fabs used came from that province.
