Simply put - I panicked.\n\nSpecifically, I sold 900 shares of COIN and 1450 shares of NVDA on 1/24. Big, big, big mistake, i.e., that same day, I could have gained (or cut my losses) by approximately $40 thousand dollars if I had waited near the end of the session to sell both of these equities. Better yet, I could have gone out to lunch and ignored the \"noise\" of the stock market and not sold either stock. My bad. My account was under $600k that day and essentially, I told myself that was a \"line in the sand\" that could not be crossed. \n\nFortunately, my story ends well? How is that? I made up for my stupidity/panic by buying AMD, KLAC, and MSFT - all at or near lows and equally important, before earnings. Consequently, my account stands at approximately $650k and was at $685,395 on 2/9 (before this Ukraine situation and inflation report was released Thursday and Friday). Consequently, I am confident I will be back to where I was back in mid January. \n\nMoral of story?

If you can consistently win with only shares, options would just amplify that effect.\n\nThe other reality with options is you can invest in ways you can't with shares. For example if I think the market is going to trade down or sideways for months I can construct options trades where I make money in that scenario where long portfolios would suffer. Many times the plan is to not take a long position at all and earn premium by selling the options that expire otm 94% of them time.\n\nI do agree that most people that trade options have not done their due diligence and don't understand even the most basic concepts of how they work.\n\nYou can also use options to scale into positions at a profit. For example if you want to buy Microsoft at $295 you can sell a $295 Put and if it is at or below that price at exp you buy at $295 and keep any premium collected to lower your cost basis. The $295P on Msft for 2/25 pays about $700 so it would give you a cost basis around $288. If it isn't under $295 on next Friday you keep the $700 and don't have to buy any shares.
