The tails of unpredictable binary events are massively FAT for a derivative of derivatives. \n\nBut I'm also noticing that nearly no one here has provided actual feedback on why predicting VIX is difficult (but not impossible). I'm gonna paste in something I wrote a while back and elaborate on why ML doesn't *directly* work but still has great potential for derivatives like VIX and its associated ETPs.\n\n>VIX itself is a calculation that basically calculates how \"hot\" the wings on an option chain 24-38ish days out (rebalancing every so often to keep a the outlook relative to 30 days out). If bid/ask goes up on the wings because funds decide to up their hedges with options/spreads, in anticipation of volatility in either direction or they slide up because of outsized demand for vol which drives premiums up as sellers are more incentivized to hold than sell then vix can spike. If you're familiar with stats then it's basically a weighted variance across strikes, or mathematically modeling it\u2014a complex system with a lot of inputs and a single output. This kind of complexity means that VIX doesn't obey regular supply/demand like many other tickers where excess pressure on either side can push the spot price in that direction. In addition there's an entire complex related to liquidity that affects how much action in the underlying spills over into the derivatives that go into the VIX calculation itself.\n\nThe key thing about ML techniques are that they allow you to work with dynamic systems that humans can't normally work with. For example, we can visualize and identify trends in R^2  or even R^3 (sometimes) but as soon as we get to more than that it becomes REALLY difficult for us. This is partially why Black-Scholes (and related pricing models) is so massively influential and revolutionary. It applies structure from partial differential equations (and a little stochastic calc) so that we can simplify everything to a couple systems in R^2 or R^3 (ex: delta vs price, theta vs time, etc.). With that, any trader can measure or predict (roughly) how a 10% drop post-earnings might affect their position(s), up to some margin of error.\n\nLikewise, as we have a structure for VIX itself, we can calculate what happens when certain things happen to SP500 options. As VIX is the sole output from the calculation and the inputs (metrics concerning index options) themselves are measurable, *one could entirely make a structure and play with parameters until getting a defined dynamic system*.\n\nIn layman's terms, this means that because of *how* the vix is calculated and *how* option prices can be calculated, you have a very dynamic **but also** very defined structure where you can use previous data to attempt to grab trends or classify behaviors. Notably this allows us to apply ML techniques to figure out stuff in spaces greater than R^3 (like using SVMs and testing out kernel functions to figure out when we're in what *volatility regime*). Hence, if you're going to be applying ML techniques, you should probably be trying to model inputs with partial information and seeing how that affects the VIX calculation.\n\n\nBut I also get it. This is 'narrative investing', so naturally the connection between narratives and the direct movement of a ticker is something we'd initially investigate. For that route, I'd recommend getting a structure going and using ML techniques to figure out some relationships between narratives and option flows in/out of the SP500 OR SP500 proxies like large tickers that compose a large portion of the index.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Thanks for the elaborate and thoughtful response. some points from my end also with respect to the original comment.\n\n* I pointed the model to the VIX as its generally a well known proxy for risk. The model can obviously be pointed towards any time series, which might be more appropriate to trade on (eg SP500 index or individual tickers), or other indicators that influence price (consumer sentiment, PMI etc)\n* The point you make on ML techniques being able to work with dynamic systems is exactly why I went that route instead of linear or other alternatives. The use of narratives likely only works with non-linear relations and interaction. Simple example, for fear to have predictive value it probably has some interaction with SP500 (or VIX or whatever), if fear increases while the VIX doesnt spike its interesting, when fear spikes while the VIX spikes its most likely fear is lagging.\n* The full dashboard (in the link) contains some investigation between narratives and price by means of granger causality tests.
