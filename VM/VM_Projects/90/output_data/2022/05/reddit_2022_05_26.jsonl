{"title": "5-25-22 SPY Daily TA", "selftext": "Trading on a day that anything with the feds is released or we see a talking head is always a dangerous but often rewarding game. Going into today and up until pretty much 3pm today I was fairly convinced I knew what was going to happen EOD and tomorrow. However, with the unexpected ending today im left undecided now. Hoping tomorrows movement will give us some confirmation. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/oy6cxut00q191.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5065b4be08747225bebafd496e100028a580774\n\nAll day today I was thinking this was the bulls chance to breakout and get some distance form this bear channel. I had a feeling we were going to see a pop after FOMC, however I really expected the bulls to do more then they did. It really the more I look at things looks like the bulls full on fumbled everything today. They were at the 1 yard line and just turned it over to the bears. Below is a picture of the Feb 16th FOMC which behaved similarly in that it pumped but the days after resulted in a massive drop. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7m5rc9i10q191.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=beace54dc6b8292e8183bc4f04a90119be61589c\n\nIf you were in my server today you could tell I was 1000% for the first time in probably two months signaling the alarms for a bear market rally and potential bull run in bound EOD and tomorrow. However, the EOD today and the close today well its changed my tune. I was even so bullish to reopen some cashed secured futures puts before FOMC minutes\u2026 that\u2019s how convinced the bulls were going to take this and run with it today. I will again present the bull and bear case. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/abw5cp220q191.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=faa72101c74f4f9ccf209de12b512e41fbded480\n\nThe VIX today did break its support line that was making consistently high lows. However, it remains in this 28-34/8 channel and usually when  it is stuck within this channel we see it bounce back up the next day to remain in this channel. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eu0zyej20q191.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0311199d6202dd7020a6a0ed486af718080b3235\n\nWhile on the 15min chart we DID breakout of the bear channel today, we are currently trading within a fairly large rising wedge. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fa328m430q191.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=5585cc17523ce28862ff00046966dc3443af7728\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bzpmj1j30q191.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=0749cfbd86cb67533adcb4e8b98bad6b28972c93\n\nNow here is where things get a little interesting and a little shall we say confusing. On the daily the candle DID break the 8 week long bear channel, HOWEVER, the WICK broke it and the candle body failed to close over the resistance line. This week (and really last) 392 to 398 has been a key range that spy has traded within numerous times. Today 398 was the resistance line of the bear channel. While we wicked above it we closed under 398 today. So we did close below a major resistance. However, holding 392 suport today was slightly bullish. We have formed a small micro bull channel on the daily also (this was also highlighted on the 15min chart). \n\nHighlighted on the right of the daily chart is three levels BLUE (most probable bear market rally)= 398 to 411, ORANGE (less probable)= 411 to 430 and RED (highly unlikely)= 430 to 438.\n\nKey levels tomorrow will be support of 392 and resistance of 398 again. Its noted by the blue arrows on the daily that back on May 12th we also had a candle WICK break the trend line. Its possible we are getting a similar movement today. Short term bull channel range is 395 to 411 tomorrow. With the bear channel (red 8 week long channel) being a resistance of 395 and unlimited downside for tomorrow. \n\nBull case- Overall the bulls the last two days have had clear momentum as they managed to turn Tuesdays clear bear movement into a massive reversal. Today we had a few bullish movements: the VIX managed to break its month long \u201csupport\u201d line of making higher lows and has not made a new higher high since May 2nd. Bulls broke through the 15min and daily bear channels. With FOMC minutes out of the way there really is no new \u201cscary\u201d news until CPI on June 10th and FOMC the week after. If bulls can hold support of 395 tomorrow and managed to close OVER 398 tomorrow we should look for a continuation of the bull run. \n\nBear case- the bulls failed to capitalize on a major day where they had the momentum from open to close (besides the last hour). Here are a few bearish sentiments I noted today: while the VIX did break its support\u2026 the VIX remained within the 28 to 34.8 range. The VIX has been within this range for exactly a month now. Almost everytime the VIX has traded within this range and reached 28 and hard rejected intraday we have seen a massive rebound the next day. In addition if we look at FOMC on May 4th we saw a similar movement. SPY broke out green and VIX massively unwound only to see a massive rebound of VIX the next day and SPY to see a -3.55% red day. From what I understand while there were not many new things in FOMC minutes there was not a lot of good news either (this is word of mouth as I didn\u2019t read myself). I find markets are always a day late to digest. Almost every major fed release, talk, etc that results in a big green day ends in massive red the next day. Also the last three days which have arguably been \u201cbullish\u201d is the lowest volume since April 21st. The interesting thing about that is it led to a massive uptick in volume that then resulted in a huge four day sell off. The bulls have only had a handful of back to back green days since March. There is also a very large ascending wedge on ES and SPY 15min chart. \n\nOverall going into tomorrow I am currently bearish. I really anticipated that we would close over 400 and give some confirmation of a breakout inbound. But what this feels like to me is more 398 to 388 consolidation. And while we may break the red bear channel and start a new channel with a failure to close over 398 today I suspect we are going to retest 392 tomorrow and potentially even 388. \n\n10% challenge-\n\nToday was a pretty great day. I was very conservative and recognized the consolidation early and chose not to trade much after 1030am.  (the 80% loss is my puts I held over night in hopes of a morning dump that never came). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ef12tn940q191.png?width=513&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee8de66f8861940be569e24e8a2d4b16f0febacc\n\nI was not really convinced I was going to hold anything over night tonight as I had to run shortly after closing to get the kiddos and prepare for our weekend camping trip. However, after diving into my TA some more I decided to open these puts for over night. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5k06t8650q191.png?width=684&format=png&auto=webp&s=b49a472d4bd8318ad0a922d62f76f31f12d0ccc1", "id": "uxvyrg", "created_utc": 1653527336.0, "score": 130, "upvote_ratio": 0.9, "num_comments": 93, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|182|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1655|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ur9t1w/51622_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/spxvil/spy_210_the_bear_rages_on/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/us0d0d/51722_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rj1up5/december_17th_spy_recap_and_next_week_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/skp8ci/24_spy_recap_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5w3m/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/up5xtr/51322_spy_weekly_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lyng6s/buy_the_rumor_sell_the_news_hear_me_out_here/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/riyt4w/december_17th_spy_recap_and_next_week_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/usqmwy/51822_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwdhxd/52322_spy_daily_ta_bonus_fomc_minutes_reaction_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwdk8h/52322_spy_daily_ta_bonus_fomc_minutes_reaction_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/rgqp0q/spy_dec_14th_recap_and_dec_15th_anticipation/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uthl4s/51922_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uthspd/51922_spy_daily_ta/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ux4ri2/52422_spy_daily_ta_fomc_minutes_prediction/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uxvyrg)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uxvyrg)\n    \nHey /u/DaddyDersch, **positions or ban.** Reply to this with a screenshot of your entry/exit.", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.27997592091560364}, {"body": "GDP and jobless claims data are also reporting premarket.

{"title": "This is big. \"Musk sued by Twitter investors for stock 'manipulation' during takeover bid REUTERS - 1:27 PM ET 5/26/2022\"", "selftext": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk was sued by Twitter Inc [( TWTR )](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=TWTR) investors claiming he manipulated the company's stock price downward, as the chief executive of electric carmaker Tesla Inc [( TSLA )](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=TSLA) mounts a $44 billion takeover bid for the social media platform.\n\nThe investors said Musk saved himself $156 million by failing to disclose that he had purchased more than 5% of Twitter by March 14. They asked to be certified as a class and to be awarded an unspecified amount of punitive and compensatory damages.\n\nThey also named Twitter as a defendant, arguing the company had an obligation to investigate Musk's conduct, though they are not seeking damages from the firm.\n\nThe investors said Musk continued to buy stock after that, and ultimately disclosed in early April that he owned 9.2% of the company, according to the lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in San Francisco federal court.\n\n\"By delaying his disclosure of his stake in Twitter, Musk engaged in market manipulation and bought Twitter stock at an artificially low price,\" said the investors, led by Virginia resident William Heresniak.\n\nNeither Musk nor his lawyer immediately responded to requests for comment. Twitter declined to comment.\n\nThe investors said the recent drop in Tesla's stock has put Musk's ability to finance his acquisition of Twitter in \"major peril\" since he has pledged his shares as collateral to secure the loans he needs to buy the company.\n\nTesla's shares were trading at around $713 on Thursday afternoon, down from above $1,000 in early April.\n\nThe timing of Musk's disclosure of his stake has already triggered an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.\n\nThe SEC requires any investor who buys a stake exceeding 5% in a company to disclose their holdings within 10 days of crossing the threshold.\n\nThe investors also said public criticism by Musk of the company, including a May 13 tweet stating the buyout was \"temporarily on hold\" until Twitter proved that spam bots accounted for less than 5% of its users, amounted to an attempt to further drive the share price down.\n\nMusk on Wednesday pledged an additional $6.25 billion in equity financing to fund his bid for Twitter, a sign he is still working to complete the deal.\n\nMusk was sued earlier this month in Delaware Chancery Court by a Florida pension fund seeking to halt the deal on the basis that some other big Twitter shareholders were supporting the buyout, a violation of Delaware law. Heresniak's lawsuit does not seek to stop the takeover.\n\n(Reporting by Luc Cohen in New York and Tom Hals in Wilmington, Del.; Editing by Noeleen Walder, Nick Zieminski and Matthew Lewis)", "id": "uyetf7", "created_utc": 1653591671.0, "score": 121, "upvote_ratio": 0.76, "num_comments": 91, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|17|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|55|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mjbb3b/company_close_updates_marathon_oil_corp_stock/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nw8lmw/thank_you_to_wall_street_bets_for_introducing_to/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/marb6g/amc_entertainment_ceos_2020_compensation_more/) [x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mauo8w/my_oh_my_why_amc_gamestop_and_sundial_are_3_of/) \n**Account Age**|1 year|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uyetf7)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uyetf7)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3427332043647766}, {"body": "For a company that literally spends zero dollars on advertising.
