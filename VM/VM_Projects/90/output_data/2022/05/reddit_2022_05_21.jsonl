{"title": "Williams Sonoma ($WSM) Earnings Play (05/25 AH)", "selftext": "Another post where I am just going to be presenting information regarding a company I have no emotional attachment towards, so please do not attack me if you disagree with what I am saying, I am just trying to make some money.\n\nI recently talked about $ANF in another post and I think I found another play that also has a good possibility of paying out, but this one has a bit more wiggle room imo. I think Williams Sonoma is currently way too high given everything that has been going on lately (supply chain issues/ inflation/ rising cost of gas/ employees demanding higher pay). Feels pretty obvious that once the free money got turned off, the entire market is pretty much reverting back to pre-covid levels. Just by looking at the 5-year chart of $WSM, you can see that this thing still has got plenty to drop.\n\n[5-year chart](https://preview.redd.it/yhbiwrg9wv091.png?width=1419&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f30f4a476b63389e82cd2e58c2fe2c660122b69)\n\nThe 5-year chart also shows that pre-covid the stock hovered around $70ish dollars while it is still over $100 as of market close Friday (05/20). One can also tell that this thing is in a very clear downward trend by looking at the 1-month chart below.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[1-month chart](https://preview.redd.it/num2bgrdwv091.png?width=1423&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6e87434d431a87d56b534f152b976ba33652243)\n\nBy looking at the current open call/put ratio below, you can see that the market sentiment going into the next week is hella fucking bearish. the 52 Wk IV30 is hot but it is still not all time high so come Monday morning, you might still be able to get in before the options prices start getting more expensive as IV rises throughout the week\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Options Skew over the weekend](https://preview.redd.it/t29rsq3hwv091.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=13bee4e72750931fa41055f82e351853f7f980f4)\n\nCurrently the only strike open is for the June 17 and below you can see how the market closed Friday.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Options price Friday \\(05\\/20\\) market close](https://preview.redd.it/8fmvcmekwv091.png?width=1653&format=png&auto=webp&s=784838e6cb940850c472b0b7ae66342f7ceb8eb8)\n\nLike I said before, the general market feeling that I have been experiencing lately is just that everything is reverting to pre-covid levels. I haven't done any additional research into current $WSM news and what is actually going on in the company. I just wanted to provide the community a lot of information. I currently do not have any open position but am looking to potentially open some if I see a good opening come Monday.\n\nEven if you don't want to hold through earnings to see if you are right on the coin flip, if you can get in early Monday and then just hold till right before market close Wednesday (right before their earnings), IV will keep rising and as long as the market is still going in the direction of your option, it should still be more expensive than when you bought it Monday (assuming market has kept tanking, which given everything haha definitely feels like it will). Options also don't expire till June 17th, so theta wont eat yo ass too fast.\n\nIf anybody knows more current events relating to the company and can contribute to the conversation that would be great, I feel like I have provided a good baseline to start a discussion \ud83d\ude43", "id": "uuupfo", "created_utc": 1653163030.0, "score": 48, "upvote_ratio": 0.91, "num_comments": 96, "comments": [{"body": "\n**User Report**| | | |\n:--|:--|:--|:--\n**Total Submissions**|5|**First Seen In WSB**|1 year ago\n**Total Comments**|1199|**Previous DD**|[x](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uuupfo/williams_sonoma_wsm_earnings_play_0525_ah/) \n**Account Age**|3 years|[^scan ^comment ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_comment&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20comment%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20comment%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)|[^scan ^submission ](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=scan_submission&message=Replace%20this%20text%20with%20a%20submission%20ID%20(which%20looks%20like%20h26cq3k\\)%20to%20have%20the%20bot%20scan%20your%20submission%20and%20correct%20your%20first%20seen%20date.)\n**Vote Spam (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_spam&message=uuupfo)|**Vote Approve (NEW)**|[Click to Vote](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=VisualMod&subject=vote_approve&message=uuupfo)", "score": 1, "replies": [], "tickers": [], "relates_score": 0.3308335244655609}, {"body": "Whats apes are not understanding is\u2026 stocks aren\u2019t going back to their Pre-pandemic levels at all\u2026 its all about PE right now\u2026 at a PE of 7.3 I doubt this drops more than 5% if that\u2026 all the companies that have gone down had high 15+ PEs.. there are very little left except Workday which has a PE of like 1200 But its been like that in forever so I wouldn\u2019t touch it either", "score": 17, "replies": [{"body": "Here after earnings to see who bought puts????
