Coca Cola did 15% YoY EPS growth in 2022 oveer 2021; but if you look at the last 10 years they've only improved by about 15%.. OVER TEN YEARS. \n\nI'm not making anything up, just look at the numbers: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/KO/cocacola/eps-earnings-per-share-diluted\n\nBetween 2011 and 2014 KO's EPS were between $1.80 and $1.90 declining to a low of just $0.29 in 2017 (not sure what happened there but it was gradual fwiw). \n\nKO's profits have since rercovered and our now near all time highs at around $2.30.\n\nBut if you think that KO is going to continue to grow 15% YoY for the next 5-years, you are dreaming my friend. The soft-drink industry is not exactly known for that kind of growth, it's saturated and has been for decades. \n\nNot even the Analaysts are predicting 15% growth, they're predicting 5% growth per year for the next 5 years (and that is IMHO being generous given KO's history).\n\nI will agree however that KO's current multiple is a symptom of the macro flgith to \"value and safety\" stocks. But to me, all it means is we're currently in a value bubble because KO has no business trading at the same PE as a hyper growth stock like TSLA. That's just crazy.\n\nAnd btw, it's not just the P/E multiples or the 5-year CAGR that is nuts between this comparison. \n\nLook at all the other traditional valuation metrics that supposed \"value investors\" look at. Prce/sales, Price/Book, Enterprise Value/Revenue, and Enterprise Value/EBITDA.\n\nAmong all of the above metrics, Tesla is cheaper than KO. That is just insane. Think about it, Tesla has a lower Price/Book value than KO at these prices...\n\nLastly, speaking of recession-proof...\n\nTesla has the IRA tax credits coming into effect in January which will drop the price of their cars by $7500. This will undoubtedly spur demand in the US. If demand is still weak because of a recession (which has yet to appear) then Tesla can cut prices further (in-line with declining material/commodity costs) to further stimulate sales. But if Tesla doesn't have to drop prices then their margins should increase as commodity prices continue to fall.\n\n In Europe, Berlin is ramping which will allow Tesla to reduce prices (should they need to) by around $5-6000 (my estimate). The 5-6k i'm referring to is the cost of import duties from Shanghai to Europe (10%) and the estimated cost of shipping/logistics of around $850-1k(according to Google). \n\nLastly, China is relaxing COVID policy which should stimulate their economy  which has been depressed because of the severe restrictions. China continues to promote EVs on their way to converting 100% of the fleet.\n\nAll of this to say Tesla is well positioned to grow sales by 40-50% in 2023. And their eps will follow.

KO won‚Äôt stay at 25X, Tesla will either keep generating a lot more EPS each year and grow the SP because of it, or earnings will get hurt because Elon would rather sell more volume, even at a loss, than maximize profit next year. \n\nI‚Äôm not making up the last bit, those are Elon‚Äôs words from the MySpace call.  I don‚Äôt think Tesla will really lose money but I do think that Elon will dramatically reduce prices to sell more cars.  \n\nNext year is a big unknown, lack of visibility is going to naturally depress the stock price of Tesla.  \n\nIf they deliver big in Q4 & again in Q1 the SP will be fine.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Respectfully, it's like you're repeating things from a typical value investing book except you're jumping to the conclusion without explaining the reason behind the logic.\n\nYou may disagree, however,  my understanding is that the reason \"value\" stocks are typically favored in recessions is because those stocks have stable, reliable earnings. Their earnings will typically grow even in recessionary environments, if very slowly.\n\n\"Value stocks\" also typically have low P/E multiples so they're less affected by rising interest rates and the impact higher borrowing costs have on discounted cash flows. Value stocks tend to have plenty of cash and low debt and are less affected if at all by higher borrowing costs. As a result PE multiples tend not to compress as they're already very low.\n\nBut ultimately, as an investor you're still looking for earnings growth. It's just slow growth is better than no growth, or worse negative growth. That said, everything else being equal (P/E, P/Sales, EV/EBITDA, etc) a stock growing eps is better than one not growing eps, whether or not you're in a recessionary environment.\n\nAlso, i'm not sure what you mean by new car sales are predicted to come down. I haven't seen these predictions myself, do you have a source? Because we're in highly unusual times. The auto companies are still working through the chip shortage. While used cars have come down, new car prices are sitll relatively elevated and that is because there is still a structural udnersupply of cars in the market.\n\nSo i don't think it's clear that car sales will come down. In fact, it isn't even clear we will have a recession or if it will be mild or severe if we do. Afterall, we had a \"recession\" earlier this year, but becaause unemployment didn't rise it wasn't a big deal. And so far, Q3 and Q4 of 2022 are positive in terms of GDP - very positive i might add. Plus, jobs are holding up...\n\nSo, if we get a recession, and that's a big IF, the soonest it will be is middle of 2023. And for that we need to see negative GDP in Q1 and then Q2.\n\nBut then the question is even if we do get a recession, how will Tesla sales hold up?\n\nAnd to that i would say why don't you look at how Tesla did over the last couple of years, during a de-facto recession (even if it was self inflicted by our governments). And the fact is Tesla managed to grow dramatically even during the COVID pandemic and ensuing recession. Not only did Tesla grow, they grew sales, revenues and eps, while simultaneously raising prices and WITHOUT subsidies in the US to boot!\n\nMeanwhile things are only getting better for Tesla. So it seems like there's plenty of evidence to suggest Tesla can in fact grow sales even during a recessionary environment.\n\nSo, what makes you think Tesla can't grow sales in 2023? I'm really curious to understand your logic, if you have any, or if you're just repeating stuff you read in a book (car sales fall in recessions blah blah blah). Look, car sales probably will fall, but i think it will be Ford, GM, and the other legacy car companies that suffer - not Tesla.\n\nLastly, what Elon said. I think it's obvious he was being hyperbolic. His point is that in the absolute worst case scenario, Tesla will still sell cars even at break even prices because more cars on the road has value for FSD development. But the likelihood that Tesla will be selling cars at 0 profit in 2023 is very very low.\n\nThe USA, EU, and China are continuing to promote EVs through subsidies and other programs. People want EV's because they're a financially smart decision, overall a better experience, and better for the environment. Tesla has the absolute best EV's on the market, hands down, no contest. Best value in terms of price/range, best in class power train efficiency, wonderful software, good prices, the biggest and best charging network, etc.\n\nThe stock price is currently depressed because there's a massive bear raid on the stock. Short % of float is around 7% if you count the off exchange volume in dark pools. There's a ton of puts being bought by retail WSB types which also forces MM's to short to delta hedge, and of course there's all the other noise. The media can't help itself but publish negative headlines when it's anything to do with Tesla/Elon, and the Twitter deal/drama has fanned the flames.\n\nLots of shareholders are probably getting margin called, and all of this is distorting the short-term supply/demand dynamics for the stock which has caused a crash. But eventually the stock's valuation will be too attractive to ignore ( i argue it allready is) and bulls will outnumber bears, shorts/MMs will have to cover as they get squeezed, and that's how you get a 50-100% move in 2-3 weeks.", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "Car sales always get hurt during period of economic stability.  \n\nU.S.-\n\nForecasters lowered their expectations for 2022 U.S. auto sales yet again, in a Cox Automotive webinar, to just 13.7 million new cars and trucks, down about 9% vs. 15 million in 2021, and down almost 20% vs. 17.1 million, in pre-COVID 2019.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/jimhenry/2022/09/29/us-auto-sales-forecast-is-cut-for-2022-bad-news-for-bargain-hunters/\n\nWe won‚Äôt be at pre-Covid levels in the U.S. (17.1 million) for awhile, certainly not next year and we will end 2022 down 20% from 2019.  \n\nNext year will be tough too because of the economic environment.  \n\nEurope-\n\nhttps://www.acea.auto/press-release/eu-car-sales-expected-to-drop-again-this-year-auto-makers-call-for-urgent-policy-action/\n\nChina-\n\n‚ÄúChina's overall auto sales growth also slowed compared to the previous two months, growing 25.7% in September to 2.61 million vehicles.\n\n\"The recovery trend is far lower than our expectation.

But it will be at lower margins and deliveries will likely not be 50%.  \n\nElon‚Äôs point was that he‚Äôs willing to trade volume for margin because of the world wide economic environment, I could not agree more with him.  \n\nAs far as your comparison to Coke goes, there isn‚Äôt one.

I absolutely agree with most of your points on why the stock is oversold, I just disagree with them being the main reasons.  \n\nNext year is going to be tough and I certainly plan on taking advantage of it. \n\nAs an aside, I can‚Äôt tell you how much I appreciate having a back & forth debate without either of us mentioning Twitter.  üëçüëçüëç", "score": 1, "replies": [{"body": "It's funny that the MSM will try to paint China's growth of 25% sales as a bad thing. And even though overall US auto sales are lower than pre-Covid, Tesla's sales are much higher which proves their cars are more desirable than the competition and there is incredible demand for them.\n\nAlso, i'm not saying that they will sell 50% more cars in 2023, maybe it's 40%, or 30% in a worst case scenario - but they will definitely sell more than 5% more cars (whereas KO is unlikely to sell more than 5% more soda). Also, in a recessionary environment when most companies EPS are declining, a company which is growing EPS deserves a premium.\n\nSome of the bearish analysts that get paraded on the MSM are predicting S&P EPS could decline 10-20% in 2023 if we get a bad recession. But no one is saying, hey.. if we get a bad recession in 2023.. how much will Tesla grow regardless? If Tesla can only grow 20-30% that is still very, very good if the S&P is losing 10-20% EPS.\n\nAnd i still don't think it's clear that margins will come down. Everyone is expecting they will but the logic behind it tends to be shallow, ie they're cutting prices. Cutting prices doesn't necessarily mean margins will come down.\n\nMeanwhile, commodity prices are deflating so COGS will be lower going forward. Tax credits are starting in 1 week which will stimulate demand at the current prices and Tesla keeps all that margin. Berlin and Austin are ramping, which has weighed on margins due to low volume inefficiencies and import duties+shipping from China to EU. Also the Dollar is weaker by almost 10% QoQ; this had a non-zero impact on GMs in Q3 as the Dollar was especially strong.\n\nFurthermore, i think analysts have yet to factor in the possible earnings contribution to the energy division from battery manufacturing tax credits and Tesla's ramp of the new Megapack facility which i estimate will be at 40GWh/year production rate in 2024. I think this is especially underappreciated and analysts are probably waiting for more clarity from the Administration and more color on Tesla's volumes/ramp. But this maybe has the most potential to surprise in 2023.\n\nLast thing on interest rates. Zero rates were an anomoly. We don't need zero rates for growth to outperform value again.\n\nIf you look at the CPI/PPI/PCE data for the last 5-6 months, it looks like inflation has averaged about 0.2% MoM during this period. Last time i looked i think i estimated that if inflation continues to rise at 0.2% MoM, then by the time we get to June we should be under 3% YoY inflation.\n\nThat being said, Nov CPI was just 0.1% MoM. If we average 0.1% MoM inflation for the next 6 months, i believe we'll be under 2% YoY inflation before June (again working from memory so i might be a little off here).\n\nSo there is considerable risk that inflation will actually slow down much faster than the Fed appear to currently be predicting (which seems to be a popular opinion on Wall Street). Then, if we also get a rapid rise in unemployment (a big if) and negative GDP (ie recession), it seems entirely possible the Fed could start cutting rates again as soon as the middle or second half of next year.\n\nBut i think it's unclear whether or not we do get a recession next year. Yet, in anticipation of a recession, defensive stocks like consumer staples, energy, food, and healthcare are all holding near their 52 week highs. Many of these companies currently have P/Es that are historically high; while tech and growth stocks are near multi-year lows.\n\nTake oil/energy stocks for example - they're near all time highs despite the fact the price of crude has collapsed by nearly 50%. In my opinion, the only way to justify the current valuation of value/defensive stocks in this market is IF we get a recession next year. It's just not clear that we will get one, and if we don't get one - these stocks are probably overvalued.\n\nIn hindsight, it is clear the time to have been cautious on growth was 1 year ago, and now it's probably the time to be cautious on value/defensive stocks. At current prices i think there are considerable risks in value/defensive sector such as 1. Recession doesn't materialize, 2. Oil prices keep falling (energy stocks), 3. Russia-Ukraine War is resolved (energy stocks), 4. Inflation cools at a quicker than expected rate, and 5.Fed pivots sooner than expected.\n\nOn the other hand, what everyone is focused on right now, is what if higher interest rates pushes the economy into recession? And to that i would say what about the past? Going as far back as 1960 until 2009 interest rates have been higher than they are today, and recessions have been few and far between.\n\nI would also add that the majority of rate hikes are allready done, and isn't it remarkable that despite going from nearly 0% rates in Aug to 4% today, we have yet to see a severe recession? It's not without analogs either as there are other periods where the fed has dramatically raised rates without a recession following soon thereafter. Look at 1993-1995 for example. The Fed Funds rate doubled from 3-6% and nothing happened. Or 2015-2019 when we went from nearly 0% to 2.4%. Higher rates didn't cause the pandemic.\n\nStill, i think the MSM and Wall St Analysts are likely to continue pushing the recession narrative essentially until the Fed pivots. And that's the real problem. Unless we get a recession, or a Fed pivot, the goal posts will continue to be pushed furhter and further out. If we don't get a recession in the 1st half of 2023, it'll come in the 2nd half etc.\n\nSo the fear-mongering is likely to continue which will probably weigh on growth/tech stocks for a considerable time to come. Having said that, there is plenty of data suggesting stocks bottom out months before eps do during recessionary environments.

Tesla always was fine.  We can reevaluate once the market is 80% BEVs, but even then, I suspect Tesla will be just fine.  Tesla has its supply chain ducks in a row and is trying to figure out how to maintain 50% growth through the rest of the decade.  Most of the rest of the industry is still stumbling out of the starting box.  And now they are even starting to openly question whether this whole EV thing is worth it.\n\nThe only names that are around right now that even have a chance to cause real trouble are from China, and I doubt that the U.S. would just let that happen once it becomes clear that GM is not, in fact, leading anything.\n\nAgain, the idea that the drip-drop of new BEVs represent a true challenge to Tesla is false.  Not because they can't possible get the performance needed -- they can -- but because they cannot produce enough or cover their costs.\n\nExpect the media to cover little flashes here and there, and then watch the numbers tumble as it turns out everyone but Tesla and the Chinese cannot even begin to make a dent in the overall demand.\n\nBut I try to hold this opinion lightly.
